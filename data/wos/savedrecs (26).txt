AB Tectonic evolution of the Ailaoshan Ocean (eastern Paleotethys), especially on the timing of opening and closure, has long been debated. Published works on the Paleotethyan evolution were mainly dedicated to structural tectonics and magmatic and metamorphic rocks, whereas studies on sediment chemistry are rare. In this study, we present new chemical data on the Permian and Middle-Upper Triassic elastic sedimentary rocks from the Ailaoshan suture zone in southwestern Yunnan (SW China). Compared with the Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) and the average upper continental crust, these Ailaoshan elastic rocks are generally depleted in LILEs (e.g. K and Rb) and HFSEs (e.g. Nb and Zr), and show varying LREE/HREE enrichments ((La/Yb)(N) = 1.32-11.86), flat HREE pattern and negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.3-0.9). In spite of these similarities, the Permian samples have relatively low SiO2 (avg. 71.4 wt%) contents, K2O/Na2O (avg. 0.65) and Eu/Eu* (avg. 0.65) ratios, but high Al2O3 (avg. 14.1 wt%), TiO2 (avg. 0.60 wt%), (Fe2OT 3 + MgO) (avg. 6.96 wt%) contents, Al2O3/SiO2 (avg. 0.20) and (La/Yb)(N) (avg. 6.9) ratios, similar to greywackes from typical continental arcs. In contrast, the Upper Triassic samples have relatively high SiO2 (avg. 81.9 wt%) contents, K2O/Na2O (avg. 8.48) and La-N/Yb-N (avg. 9.74) ratios, but low Al2O3 (avg. 9.98 wt%), TiO2 (avg. 0.54 wt%), (Fe2OT 3 + MgO) (avg. 5.26 wt%) contents, Al2O3/SiO2 (avg. 0.12) and Eu/Eu* (avg. 0.64) ratios, similar to greywackes from typical passive continental margin. Moreover, the Permian samples have lower CIA values (Chemical Index of Alteration: 47-74, avg. 59) but higher ICV values (Index of Compositional Variability: 0.70-1.29, avg. 1.03) than those of PAAS, indicating relatively weak chemical weathering of the source rocks with low sediment maturity. In contrast, the Upper Triassic samples have relatively high CIA (77-84, avg. 80) but low ICV values (0.52-1.12, avg. 0.79), suggesting intense chemical weathering of the source rocks with high sediment maturity. The wide range of CIA (52-84, avg. 69) and ICV (0.50-1.14, avg. 0.88) values for the Middle Triassic samples suggest multiple detrital sources with varying degree of chemical weathering and diverse sediment maturity, as also supported by their wide range of detrital contents and chemical compositions. Based on the distinct chemical contrast between the Permian and Triassic sedimentary rocks, we infer that a significant change in detrital provenance and depositional setting may have occurred across the Middle and Late Triassic boundary, which was likely caused by the closure of the Ailaoshan Ocean.

AB Our understanding of the geological structures and kinematics of thick-skinned and thin-skinned tectonics during the evolution of an orogenic system is strongly related to field evidence of decollement-dominated tectonics or deformation involving the entire middle and lower continental crust. In this paper, we compare thin-skinned and thick-skinned deformation of the Zagros orogen from small to large-scales. In the foreland thin-skinned region sedimentary rocks with several decollement horizons have undergone in-sequence thrusting with dominant NW-striking, NE-dipping and SW-verging displacement. The gneissic basement of the foreland underwent Permo-Triassic rifting and the normal faults were reactivated as thrust or strike-slip faults during subduction-to-collision orogenic system. There is no field exposures of deformed basement windows in this external part of orogen. However, in the internal parts of the orogen, the newly recognized hinterland fold-and-thrust belt and slate belt, there are outcrops of gneissic basement slices, mylonitic shear zones, and granite gneissic flow. The Tutak granite-gneiss dome is associated with sole thrusts. Therefore, it contains deformed margins of both continents. Thus in deformation in this part of the orogen was thick-skinned. Measurements of quartz c-axis opening angles of the exhumed mylonite nappes document high temperature (similar to 642 degrees +/- 43 degrees and similar to 424 degrees +/- 31 degrees C). Relationship between kinematic vorticity number (Wk = Wm = 0.76 +/- 0.06) of the mylonite nappes which are related to the hinterland fold-and-thrust belt indicate 55 +/- 7.8% simple shear and 45 +/- 7.4% pure shear components for instantaneous 2D flow which indicate sub-simple shear deformation. On the more thickened side of the Zagros deformed basement-involved contains continuous to discontinuous shear band boudins of eclogite and slices of blue schist. This provide kinematic indicators suggesting simultaneous dip slip and strike-slip and shear zones accelerating inclined lateral exhumation of the high-pressure metamorphic rocks of oceanic and continental crustal origin. Both the thin and thick-skinned portions of the Zagros on three major cross sections indicate the intensity of deformation in the NW and SE parts of the belt that display the opposite senses of shear on the two sides. We infer that both senses of shear were developed coevally under a bulk sub-simple shear, regional-scale deformation along a curved inclined transpression. Study of crustal-scale cross sections of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic sequences shows that asymmetrical to symmetrical folding an d thrusting in the central part of the Zagros foreland fold-and-and-thrust belts in the Fars area are gentle in comparison with those in the SE and NW of the orogen. The highest intensity of deformation occurs in the rotated asymmetrical folding and thrusting near the Bandar Abbas Syntaxis.

AB Partial melting of the garnet (Grt)-bearing biotite gneiss from the Jianggalesayi area in the southern Altyn Tagh high pressure (HP) - ultra high pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt has been identified and reported here. Felsic veins were distributed along the foliation plane and deformed together with the Grt-bearing biotite gneiss, which dominated the main outcrop and preserved diagnostic features of anataxis. Highly cuspate and irregular quartz (Qz)-melt and plagioclase (P1)-melt surrounded or stretched into biotite and/or quartz grains with obvious eroded boundaries further provided the microstructural evidences for partial melting of the gneiss. CL images showed that zircons from the Grt-bearing biotite gneiss were characterized by multizone structures of core - Rim I - Rim II - Rim III. The different zircon zones from the gneiss had integrated recordings of the protolith ages 836-1613 Ma; the peak metamorphic age of 503 +/- 5 Ma; the retrograded age of 456 +/- 4 Ma; and the anatectic age of 418 +/- 3 Ma. Zircons from felsic veins also exhibited core - rim structures on CL images. The felsic veins yielded similar protolith ages (1099-1072 Ma) and anatectic age (417 +/- 2 Ma) as the host gneiss. The zircons from the host gneiss and felsic veins had plotted identical crustal evolution curves in the epsilon Hf (t) vs. U-Pb age diagram with identical T-DM ages. The U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotope both suggested that the felsic veins were internally derived by the partial melting of the host gneiss. Moreover, the high content of Al2O3 and Rb in felsic veins indicated that the decomposition of biotite accounted for the partial melting of the gneiss. The temperatures calculated by Ti-in-zircon thermometer for the anatectic zircons from the felsic veins (582-694 degrees C) were identical to the conditions of the amphibolite fades stage of the Grt-bearing biotite gneiss (T = 619-646 degrees C), which indicated that the crystallization of the melt had taken place during the amphibolite facies stage of the exhumation. The anatectic ages (418 +/- 3 Ma and 417 +/- 2 Ma) of the gneiss and felsic veins were determined to be within the range of the fourth episode of the early Paleozoic magmatism (420-385 Ma), which had formed in a post-collisional extensional setting. Therefore, the combination of the magmatic heat events and stress release may have played an important role in the partial melting of the gneiss.

AB Cherts occur extensively as stratal wedges embedded in the Middle-Lower Ordovician carbonate successions in the circum-Tangguzibasi areas, south-east Tarim Basin, where thick (up to 2 km), dark grey well-stratified limestones deposited in shelf and platform environments are prominent. Based on detailed core and thin section observations, with petrographic, microthermometric, and geochemical data for the Middle-Lower Ordovician cherts in some key wells, two lithotypes of chert are identified across the marginal zone in the western Tangguzibasi areas: replacement and filled cherts. Replacement chert is characterized by granular micro-crystalline quartz or radially fibrous chalcedony and commonly retains the pre-existing dolomite rhombs and elliptical ooids floating in these cherts. Filled chert, the most common type, is generally rimmed by fine-gained euhedral quartz that grades abruptly into vein-cavity-fill mega-quartz. Compositionally, these chert deposits are strongly enriched in Cr, Zn, Ba and U and generally show apparent right-convex REE patterns with low Sigma REE values (avg. 4.24 ppm), weak negative Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce*: avg. 0.93) and low to intermediate positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*: avg. 1.19), particularly the replacement cherts. Microthermometry of fluid inclusions from coarse quartz reveals high homogenization temperatures from 135 to 195 degrees C for trapped primary fluids with high salinities (11.0-18.9 wt%). These siliceous deposits also have low La/Ho and Th/U, relatively high Y/Ho and Ba/Sr, high Ce/Ce* (similar to 1.06), intermediate to high (Lu/La)(N) (0.5-1.0) and low (La/Ce)(N) (mostly 1.31-1.45). All these data suggest that the cherts formed under the strong influence of hydrothermal fluids originating from detritus-poor hydrogenetic Fe-Mn crusts at deep continental margins. Extensive silicification occurred after intense dolomitization and calcitization, while fracturing/faulting were greatly intensified in the host carbonates, induced by intense extension because of the uplift force of the magma cushion under oblique collision during the Early Permian. Most silica could have directly precipitated from hydrothermal fluids to chalcedony fibres around voids and vein cherts along fracture conduits. These petrological and geochemical data also provide a useful clue to better understand the extensive silica precipitation, intense tectono-hydrothermal activity and significant lithospheric fracturing events as a result of the closure of the South Tienshan and Palaeo-Tethys Oceans during the Early-Middle Permian.

AB The Sipoholon system in the Tarutung Basin is one of five geothermal systems associated with a c. 100 km stretch of the Sumatra Fault System (SFS) in North-Central Sumatra, Indonesia, that exhibits parallel sets of dextral strike-slip faults associated with seismic activity. Characteristics of discharged thermal fluids differ significantly between the systems. The gas-rich Sipoholon field transfers only c. 19 MW heat by Ca-SO4/HCO3 springs with SiO2 fluid equilibria pointing to temperatures of 50-80 degrees C at intermediate depths. Most of its thermal springs (T < 63 degrees C) are associated with significant gas (CO2) discharges and travertine deposits but cannot be interpreted as manifestations of a medium to high temperature system. A deep exploratory well has not yet been drilled in the Sipoholon field.
   In contrast, all four thermal systems in the Sarulla Block concession to the southeast of the Sipoholon field are convective high temperature systems that transfer significant heat to the surface. Fumaroles, steaming ground, thermal springs, hot pools and thermal lakes discharge at least 50 MW heat at three of the four prospects where the temperatures of springs and fumaroles often reach boiling point. Many hot springs of the Sarulla Block systems discharge dominantly Na-HCO3/Cl type waters with partially equilibrated cation compositions, a result of fluid-rock equilibration and mixing processes. SiO2 fluid equilibria indicate 130 to c. 200 degrees C with cation geothermometers pointing to a high reservoir temperature (200-260 degrees C) for all four systems. This was confirmed by the first deep exploratory wells drilled c. 20 years ago in three prospects that encountered T > 250 degrees C at bottom hole (> 1.5 km depth).
   The structural setting of the five geothermal fields is complex. At Tarutung it is associated with the narrow Tarutung Basin, filled with volcanic debris and ash. The basin exhibits a partly exposed dextral strike-slip fault along its NE margin and can be interpreted in terms of a trans-tensional pull-apart basin. Two of the adjacent Sarulla Block systems are associated with large volcanic debris basins (Namora-I-Langit and Silangkitang) that exhibit 'half-graben' structures in profiles normal to two large active faults of the Sumatra Fault System (SFS). The other two systems (Donotasik and Sibualbuali) are hosted by an elongated graben structure parallel and within the SFS and by a stratovolcano respectively.

TI Distribution and genetic types of loess landslides in China

AB In this study, 14,544 loess landslides collected from the Loess Plateau of China are used to reveal their distribution and origins. Main factors considered include landslide density, regional tectonics, soil properties, geomorphic structure, rainfall distribution, seismic activity, and human activity. Based on these factors, the Loess Plateau is divided into eight zones with high possibilities of landslides that are classified into six genetic types. The first genetic type of clustering distribution of loess landslides is related to several main regional active faults. The second type is related to broken pieces of loess geomorphic structures. The third type is considered to be due to unloading of the geomorphic peripheral slope that can cause the internal structural plane to open and thus controls the prototype and scale of the loess landslide. Change of hydrogeological conditions in the slope softens the loess pedestal and the slippery layer, forming a softening zone and thus controlling the shear crack and slip model of the fourth type of loess landslides. The fifth type is due to seismic activities that can generate additional stress to the Earth's surface and landform slopes, causing the opening of joints and seismic liquefaction. The last type of landslides is caused by human activities by changing the geological structure, hydro geological conditions, and the inner stress balance of slopes.

AB The lower Jinsha River has the highest sediment yield rates of the entire Yangtze watershed; these high yields have previously been attributed to a mix of the local geologic setting as well as intensive human land use, particularly agriculture. Prior studies have not quantified long-term background rates of sediment generation, making it difficult to know if modern sediment yield is elevated relative to the long-term rate of sediment generation.
   Using in situ Be-10 in detrital river sediments, we measured sediment generation rates for tributaries to the lower Jinsha River. We find that the ratio of modern sediment yield to long-term sediment generation rate is 5.9 +/- 2.8 (mean, 1 SD, n = 5), which is significantly higher than that elsewhere in western China and implies contemporary rates of sediment export far exceed long-term rates of sediment generation by weathering on hillslopes (1.9 +/- 1.6 [median, 1 SD, n = 20]; [Schmidt et al., 2017]). Long-term (thousand year) rates of sediment generation correlate best with the steepness of the upstream watershed, a result found around the world. In contrast, modem sediment yield and the ratio of sediment yield to sediment generation rates correlate best with agricultural land use and distance to the nearest dam. Modern (1950s-1980s) sediment yield and the ratio of sediment yield to sediment generation rate also correlate well with percent of the watershed containing landslides observable today. The significantly higher modem sediment yield, lack of correlation between percent of the basin with landslides and long-term rates of sediment generation, and widespread deforestation and agriculture in the region suggest that landslide scars observable today are at least in part a result of human-induced land use change. Thus, we conclude that a mix of geologic setting and human activity control high contemporary sediment yield rates in the region.

AB Graptolites are described from the Llandovery of the Sepon mine area, central Laos, part of the Truong Son Terrane. The palaeobiogeographical affinities of the Rhuddanian graptolites are with peri-Gondwanan Europe and Arabia rather than equatorial regions such as South China and Laurentia (Arctic Canada). A review of previous palaeontological research on the middle Palaeozoic of the Indochina terranes reveals an often contradictory picture with vertebrates suggesting close proximity of South China to the Truong Son Terrane in the Devonian and invertebrates and radiolarians providing evidence for a palaeogeographical barrier between the two. Graptolites from the Mojiang area, Yunnan are typical of low latitude Silurian faunas and suggest that this area (Simao or Loei Terrane) was separate from the Truong Son Terrane.

   In the last five years we have reviewed structure/electrochemistry of metalloproteins expressing: (i) single types of iron-sulfur clusters (namely: {Fe(Cys)(4)}, {[Fe2S2](Cys)(4)}, {[Fe2S2](Cys)(3)(X)} (X = Asp, Arg, His), [Fe2S2] (Cys)(2)(His)(2)}, {[Fe3S4](Cys)(3)}, {[Fe4S4](Cys)(4)} and {[Fe4S4](Cys)(3)(nonthiolate ligand)} cores); (ii) metalloproteins harboring iron-sulfur centres of different nuclearities (namely: [4Fe-4S] and [2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S] and [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S], [3Fe-4S] and [2Fe-2S] clusters. Our target is now to review structure and electrochemistry of proteins harboring canonical, non-canonical and hybrid iron-sulfur proteins.

AB Cross-sections of calcitic prismatic layers in mollusk shells, cut perpendicular to growth direction, reveal welldefined polygonal shapes of individual "grains" clearly visible by light and electron microscopy. For several kinds of shells, it was shown that the average number of edges in an individual prism approaches six during the growth process. Taking into account the rhombohedral symmetry of calcite, often presented in hexagonal axes, all this led to the long-standing opinion that calcitic prisms grow along the c-axis of calcite. In this paper, using X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), we unambiguously show that calcitic prisms in pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera predominantly grow perpendicular to the c-axis. The obtained results imply that the hexagon-like habitus of growing crystallites may be not necessarily connected to calcite crystallography and, therefore, other factors should be taken into consideration. We analyze this phenomenon by comparing the organic contents in Pinctada margaritifera and Pinna nobilis shells, the later revealing regular growth of calcitic prisms along the c-axis.

AB Trypanosoma cruzi has a complex life cycle where two infective developmental stages, known as trypomastigote and amastigote, can be found in the vertebrate host. Both forms can invade a large variety of cellular types and induce the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole (PV), that, posteriorly, disassembles and releases the parasites into the host cell cytoplasm. The biogenesis of T. cruzi PVs has not been analyzed in professional phagocytic cells. We investigated the biogenesis of PVs containing trypomastigotes or amastigotes in peritoneal macrophages. We observed the presence of profiles of the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes from the host cell near PVs at early stages of interaction in both developmental stages, suggesting that both organelles may participate as possible membrane donors for the formation of the PVs. The Golgi complex, however, was observed only near already formed PVs. Electron microscopy tomography and FIB-SEM microscopy followed by 3D reconstruction of entire PVs containing amastigotes or trypomastigotes confirmed the presence of both endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes in the initial stages of PV formation. In addition, Golgi complex and mitochondria localize around PVs during their biogenesis. Taken together these observations provide a whole view of the invasion process in a professional phagocytic cell.

AB Up-regulation of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) expression is an indicator of metastasis and associated with poor cancer patient prognosis. CA IX has emerged as a cancer drug target but development of isoform-specific inhibitors is challenging due to other highly conserved CA isoforms. In this study, a CA IXmimic construct was used (CA II with seven point mutations introduced, to mimic CA DC active site) while maintaining CA II solubility that make it amenable to crystallography. The structures of CA IXmimic unbound and in complex with saccharin (SAC) and a saccharin-glucose conjugate (SGC) were determined using joint X-ray and neutron protein crystallography. Previously, SAC and SGC have been shown to display CA isoform inhibitor selectivity in assays and X-ray crystal structures failed to reveal the basis of this selectivity. Joint X-ray and neutron crystallographic studies have shown active site residues, solvent, and H-bonding re-organization upon SAC and SGC binding.

TI Response of the tooth-periodontal ligament-bone complex to load: A

AB One strategy evolved by teeth to avoid irreversible damage is to move and deform under the loads incurred during mastication. A key component in this regard is the periodontal ligament (PDL). The role of the bone underlying the PDL is less well defined. We study the interplay between the PDL and the underlying alveolar bone when loaded in the minipig. Using an Instron loading device we confirmed that the force-displacement curves of the molars and premolars of relatively fresh minipig intact mandibles are similar to those obtained for humans and other animals. We then used this information to obtain 3D images of the teeth before and after loading the tooth in a microCT such that the load applied is in the third linear part of the force displacement curve. We observed that at many locations there is a complimentary topography of the cementum and alveolar bone surface, strongly suggesting an active interplay between the tooth and the bone during mastication. We also observed that the loaded tooth does not come into direct contact with the underlying bone surface. A highly compressed layer of PDL is present between the tooth and the bone. The structure of the bone in the upper furcation region has a unique appearance with little obvious microstructure, abundant pores that have a large size range and at many locations the bone at the PDL interface has a needle -like shape. We conclude that there is a close interaction between the tooth, the PDL and the underlying alveolar bone during mastication. The highly compressed PDL layer that separates the tooth from the bone may fulfill a key shock absorbing function.

AB Using a new Titan Krios stage equipped with a single-axis holder, we developed two methods to accelerate the collection of tilt-series. We demonstrate a continuous-tilting method that can record a tilt-series in seconds, but with loss of details finer than 4 nm. We also demonstrate a fast-incremental method that can record a tilt-series several-fold faster than current methods and with similar resolution. We characterize the utility of both methods in real biological electron cryotomography workflows. We identify opportunities for further improvements in hardware and software and speculate on the impact such advances could have on structural biology.

AB This is the first X-ray crystal structure of the monomeric form of sulfite reductase (SiR) flavoprotein (SiRFP-60) that shows the relationship between its major domains in an extended position not seen before in any homologous diflavin reductases. Small angle neutron scattering confirms this novel domain orientation also occurs in solution. Activity measurements of SiR and SiRFP variants allow us to propose a novel mechanism for electron transfer from the SiRFP reductase subunit to its oxidase metalloenzyme partner that, together, make up the SiR holoenzyme. Specifically, we propose that SiR performs its 6-electron reduction via intramolecular or intermolecular electron transfer. Our model explains both the significance of the stoichiometric mismatch between reductase and oxidase subunits in the holoenzyme and how SiR can handle such a large volume electron reduction reaction that is at the heart of the sulfur bio-geo cycle.

AB Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are large conductance intracellular channels controlling intracellular calcium homeostasis in myocytes, neurons, and other cell types. Loss of RyR's constitutive cytoplasmic partner FKBP results in channel sensitization, dominant subconductance states, and increased cytoplasmic Ca2+. FKBP12 binds to RyR1's cytoplasmic assembly 130 angstrom away from the ion gate at four equivalent sites in the RyR1 tetramer. To understand how FKBP12 binding alters RyR1's channel properties, we studied the 3D structure of RyR1 alone in the closed conformation in the context of the open and closed conformations of FKBP12-bound RyR1. We analyzed the metrics of conformational changes of existing structures, the structure of the ion gate, and carried out multivariate statistical analysis of thousands of individual cryoEM RyR1 particles. We find that under closed state conditions, in the presence of FKBP12, the cytoplasmic domain of RyR1 adopts an upward conformation, whereas absence of FKBP12 results in a relaxed conformation, while the ion gate remains closed. The relaxed conformation is intermediate between the RyR1-FKBP12 complex closed (upward) and open (downward) conformations. The closed-relaxed conformation of RyR1 appears to be consistent with a lower energy barrier separating the closed and open states of RyR1-FKBP12, and suggests that FKBP12 plays an important role by restricting conformations within RyR1's conformational landscape.

AB Caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-only proteins (COPs), regulate apoptosis, inflammation, and innate immunity. They inhibit the assembly of NOD-like receptor complexes such as the inflammasome and NODosome, which are molecular complexes critical for caspase-1 activation. COPs are known to interact with either caspase-1 CARD or RIP2 CARD via a CARD-CARD interaction, and inhibit caspase-1 activation or further downstream signaling. In addition to the human COPs, Pseudo-ICE, INCA, and ICEBERG, several viruses also contain viral COPs that help them escape the host immune system. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of host immunity inhibition by viral COPs, we solved the structure of a viral COP for the first time. Our structure showed that viral COP forms a structural transformation-mediated dimer, which is unique and has not been reported in any structural study of a CARD domain. Based on the current structure, and the previously solved structures of other death domain superfamily members, we propose that structural transformation-mediated dimerization might be a new strategy for dimer assembly in the death domain superfamily.

AB Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments were carried out to investigate the structural changes of cardiac thin filaments induced by the cardiomyopathy-causing E244D mutation in troponin T (TnT). We examined native thin filaments (NTF) from a bovine heart, reconstituted thin filaments containing human cardiac wild-type Tn (WTF), and filaments containing the E244D mutant of Tn (DTF), in the absence and presence of Ca2+. Analysis by model calculation showed that upon Ca2+-activation, tropomyosin (Tm) and Tn in the WIT and NTF moved together in a direction to expose myosin-binding sites on actin. On the other hand, Tm and Tn of the DTF moved in the opposite directions to each other upon Ca2+-activation. These movements caused Tm to expose more myosin-binding sites on actin than the WTF, suggesting that the affinity of myosin for actin is higher for the DTF. Thus, the mutation-induced structural changes in thin filaments would increase the number of myosin molecules bound to actin compared with the WTF, resulting in the force enhancement observed for the E244D mutation.

ID SINGLE-MOLECULE; SERS; ARRAYS
AB Simple methods capable of preparing high performance SERS substrates are highly desirable. Here, a simple electrochemical approach is developed to prepare silver nanoflowers with outstanding surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance. The silver nanoflowers are composed of hundreds of silver nanoleaves. These nanoleaves weaved together to form the silver nanoflowers. Notably, the silver nanoleaves are porous with many nanoscale pores. Numerous SERS "hot spots" exist at the overlapping points of the silver nanoleaves, as well as within the nanoscale pores of the porous silver nanoleaves. As expected, the silver nanoflowers demonstrate a high SERS sensitivity. As low as 1 nM Rhodamine 6G could be detected using the silver nanoflower SERS substrate. Moreover, the standard deviation of the SERS signals is only about 13.5%, underlying a good detection reliability of the silver nanoflower substrate. The high SERS sensitivity and the strong SERS detection reliability make the silver nanoflower SERS substrate have promising application in ultrasensitive detection fields. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A comprehensive analysis on crystal growth and viscosity is presented for the Ge2Sb2Se5-xTex (x = 0.5 and 1) undercooled melts in this article. Temperature dependence of the measured viscosities (10(7.5)-10(12.5) Pa.s) can be described by a simple exponential Arrhenius type equation in the relatively narrow temperature region in which the measurements were performed. Fragility of the measured materials are all roughly equal to 43, which means that these materials belong to the so called "intermediate" liquids (lying in the middle between strong and fragile liquids) and cannot be described by simple Arrhenius type equation if the temperature region is expanded from glass transition to melting, which is important for description of crystal growth. Therefore, MYEGA equation is used to extrapolate the viscosity data into the temperature region of studied crystal growth. Nucleation and crystal growth started on a surface of studied samples. The isothermal growth rate of the formed surface crystalline layer was measured at various temperatures. Analysis of the growth data revealed a crystal growth driven by liquid-crystal interface kinetics. Therefore, the standard crystal growth models were used for description of crystal growth rates in the studied systems.

AB Structural, optical and magnetic properties of some lead tellurite glass ceramics doped with europium(III) ions and co-doped with fixed amounts of metallic copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) or copper(II) ions (via CuO) were investigated. Samples in the (Eu2O3)(x)center dot(TeO2)(80)center dot(PbO)((19.7-x))center dot(CuNPs)(0.3) and (Eu2O3)(x)center dot(TeO2)(80)center dot(PbO)((19.7-x))center dot(CUO)(0.3) systems with 0 <= x <= 10 mol% were obtained and investigated for the first time. Several techniques such as X-ray diffraction, UV-VIS, EPR and luminescence spectroscopies and density and magnetic susceptibility measurements were used in order to characterize the samples. XRD data show that the samples with low Eu2O3 contents (x <= 1 mol%) are amorphous while for higher europium oxide contents (x > 1 mol%) are glass ceramics. They also reveal that increasing the Eu2O3 content of samples the symmetry around the europium ions changes from face centered cubic to monoclinic. These symmetry changes are confirmed by the photoluminescence data. In addition, photoluminescence data show that the co-doping with metallic copper nano particles enhances the emission peaks of europium ions. UV-VIS absorption spectra show the presence of six coordinated copper (II) ions located at sites with a distorted octahedral symmetry. The EPR data confirm the presence of copper (II) ions in all the studied samples. Magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest the presence of europium ions in both their 3+ and 2+ valence states and evidence an important clustering tendency of europium ions even for low Eu2O3 contents.

AB The alleged formation of La-clusters in silicate glasses has received an overall consensus. However, recent and the current experimental results do not support this hypothesis for the structural role of La2O3 in glasses. Therefore, here we propose a new model for the assignment of the peaks in NMR spectra. All the experimental results here reported could be consistently explained by ascribing to La2O3 a network modifier role. Further, the proposed model could also explain the network modifier role of La2O3 in silicate glass compositions reported in literature where it was originally ascribed to form La-clusters. The La2O3 mitigated the LLPS due to increased entropy from the increasing number of different types of Q(n) structural units.

AB Nowadays the study of physiochemical stability of amorphous pharmaceuticals is of great interest in the field of medicinal application due to its enhanced water solubility and bioavailability than its crystalline counterpart. Molecular relaxations play an important role in understanding the physical stability of amorphous drugs. Hence herein, we investigated the molecular dynamics of three pharmaceutically important drugs, namely clofoctol, droperidol and probucol by means of broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The dielectric spectra in the supercooled state were fitted by Havriliak-Negami (HN) function, while in the glassy state with Cole-Cole equation. The structural relaxation followed non-Arrhenius temperature dependence and followed time-honored Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation and the secondary relaxation followed Arrhenius equation. The Coupling model (CM) prediction was used to find the origin of the secondary relaxations. Although the three drugs were found to be fragile, clofoctol and droperidol showed recrystallization tendency. It was amazing that the three samples showed a good correlation between the stretch exponent beta(KWW) and the dielectric strength Delta epsilon(T-g). In addition, the molecular simulation was used to verify the presence of non-JG (Johari-Goldstein) secondary relaxation due to side chain rotation.

AB The interaction of Ge9As9Se82 and Ge16As24Se80 amorphous chalcogenide thin films with electron beam has been investigated. The kinetics of surface relief formation was determined for both film compositions. It was established that for identical electron beam irradiation parameters, the kinetics of relief formation can be correlated with charge accumulation rate, its final value inside films and charge diffusion away from the electron interaction region. Charge model has been used to explain various phenomena during electron beam interaction with studied systems and parameters of this model are determined. Application of studied systems in single stage electron beam lithography is also presented.

AB Y2O3 nanocrystals triply doped with Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ ions were synthesized via alginic acid-assisted gelation using thermal decomposition method and annealed at 800 degrees C for 24 h. Nanopowders were embedded into PMMA matrix via free-radical polymerization in an ultrasonic bath. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements have shown that the crystal grain sizes decreased significantly with the narrow size distributions of the nanocrystals in PMMA matrix. A diode laser at 975 nm was used to measure the upconversion luminescence of the annealed nanopowders and those embedded in PMMA between the 400-850 nm wavelength region. The Er3+ concentration and the excitation power density dependencies of the relative intensities for red, green and blue upconversion luminescence in the nanopowder and PMMA nanocomposites are found to be different. The measured CIE-1931 color coordinates of the upconversion luminescence in PMMA nanocomposites show appreciable color stability under different excitation power densities, which is required for potential applications in the field of photonics.

AB To develop an excellent low-dimensional magnetic material, the evolution of microstructure and soft magnetic properties in thin films with thickness as well as annealing treatment has been systematically investigated. Fe-Si-B-P-C thin films were fabricated using radio frequency magnetron sputtering. Microstructure of as-deposited and as-annealed thin films with various thicknesses have been characterized, and corresponding soft magnetic properties have been studied. The magnetic domain structure in thin films was further characterized via the magneto-optical Kerr microscope. It is revealed that all these as-deposited thin films exhibit a columnar structure, and the surface roughening is in accordance with the anomalous scaling. The coercivity gradually decreases from 4.8 Oe for 61 nm-thick film to 0.6 Oe for 608 nm-thick film, and almost remains constant with further increasing thickness, while the magnetic impedance ratio rises with thickness. After 473 K-annealing treatment coercivity decreases and magnetic impedance ratio increases, which can be attributed to the release of residual stress and the enhanced exchange coupling. After annealing at 573 K, although no obvious improvement in coercivity occurs, magnetic impedance ratio further rises due to the enhanced electrical conductivity and the reduced magnetic anisotropy. Severe crystallization takes place after annealed at 673 K, deteriorating soft magnetic properties of thin films. Therefore, the 573 K-annealed Fe-Si-B-P-C thin film with 1210 nm in thickness exhibits the best soft magnetic properties, having coercivity of 0.3 Oe, magnetic impedance ratio of 66.2% and relatively low magnetic anisotropy, which is a very promising soft magnetic material for sensor application.

AB In this research, the dynamic behavior of serrated flows observed in the flexural stress-deflection curves during three-point bending (3 PB) tests on Zr-, Ti- and La-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) is statistically analyzed. Furthermore, the effect of strain rate on the serrations is studied. Based on the ductility of alloy, two distinct types of dynamics are detected. For more ductile alloys (Zr- and Ti-based BMGs) the stress drop magnitude of serrations obeys a power-law distribution of shear avalanches, which is an indicator of the self-organized critical (SOC) state in dynamics. In this case, the size of avalanches has no characteristic scale. In contrast, the size of serrations corresponding to the less ductile alloy (La-based BMG) exhibits a characteristic length scale and implies that the underlying dynamics is chaotic. Results indicate that the plasticity in less ductile alloy can be related to the stick-slip process of a few shear bands, but in the case of more ductile alloys, it can be attributed to the simultaneous nucleation and interaction of a large number of shear bands. Above a critical strain rate, the serrations on flexural stress-deflection curves do not appear and a transition occurs from the serrated to non serrated plastic flow. The comparison of apparent activation energy for the onset of serrated flow and the STZ activation energy indicates that these two processes are interrelated. Using these values, it is possible to determine the dynamic behavior of serrated flows in BMGs.

AB In this paper, silica aerogels and carbon aerogels were prepared by ambient pressure drying and freeze drying, respectively. The microstructure and adsorption capability of the two kinds of aerogels for antibiotics in water were investigated. The results showed that silica aerogels and carbon aerogels exhibited completely different adsorption capability for antibiotics although they possessed similar specific surface area (665-765 m(2)/g) and pore volume (1.6-3.0 cm(3)/g). The silica aerogel, no matter how they are hydrophobic or hydrophilic, both showed much lower adsorption rate for antibiotics than the carbon aerogel. By contrast, the carbon aerogel and magnetic carbon aerogel both showed excellent adsorption performance for antibiotics, with the adsorption rate for terramycin within 180 min attaining to 99.9%. The adsorption mechanism of terramycin on the two kinds of aerogels was studied using kinetic adsorption models. It has been clarified that the adsorption process of the two aerogels is mainly based on chemical adsorption with the assistance of physical adsorption. Moreover, the carbon aerogel exhibited higher adsorption stability for antibiotics without desorption phenomenon, and the magnetic carbon aerogels have excellent recycling utilization performance.

AB A low-cost and high-performance quartz fiber/Al2O3-SiO2 aerogel (QF/ASA) composite insulation material has been successfully prepared by vacuum filtration molding and sol-gel impregnation following surface-modified ambient pressure drying (APD). The macroporous in the quartz fiber perform are filled by Al2O3-SiO2 aerogels with a large amount of mesoporous. The morphology, microstructure, thermal conductivity and thermal stability of the QF/ASA composite were investigated. Compared to the fiber/aerogel materials dried by supercritical drying, the composite exhibits similar low density (0.36 g.cm(-3)), high specific surface area (580.5 m(2).g(-1)), low thermal conductivity (0.049 W.m(-1).K-1) at room temperature. The compressive strength of the composite up to 0.85 MPa which is approximately triple as much as that of fiber perform. After being heated at 600 to 1100 degrees C, the specific surface area of composite aerogel decrease from 578.0 to 113.6 m(2).g(-1) and the linear shrinkage is almost zero. The XRD patterns show that mullite (3Al(2)O(3)center dot 2SiO(2)) appeared in the Al2O3-SiO2 aerogel after heat treatment at 1100 degrees C, which is consistent with the molar ratio of silica and alumina of 2:3.

AB Fe84.3-xCuxSi4B8P3Cu0.7 (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 at.%) alloy ribbons were fabricated by melt spinning. Results showed that the FeCoSiBPCu alloys added with 0-10 at.% Co showed improved amorphization. The modified alloys displayed not only high thermal stability but also high heat treatment temperature in the range of 150-160 K. Compared with the other Co-containing alloys, the alloys added with 2-4 at.% Co exhibited a higher saturation magnetization (M-s) of approximately 181-194 emu/g and a lower coercive force (H-c) of approximately 10.2-12.3 A/m, thus showing improved magnetic properties in the melt-spun state. When annealed before the secondary onset crystallization temperature, all alloys crystallized a single alpha-Fe phase. After annealing at 833 K for 10 min, the alloys added with 8-10 at.% Co showed excellent soft magnetic properties, including a high M-s of 198-200 emu/g and a low H-c of 2.6-2.9 A/m.

AB In this contribution, we presented a systematical investigation and prepared partially vitrified ceramic foam materials using polymetallic ore tailings (POTs) and other waste as raw materials. More importantly, six different POTs were evaluated in terms of bloating behavior, besides, the effects of sintering temperature and fly ash (FA) content on the structure, physical-mechanical properties and chemical stability were investigated. Our results revealed that among all selected POTs, the BT2 sample exhibits the best bloating ability due to the formation of appropriate liquid content, which is favorable for forming stable pore structure. Increased sintering temperature can accelerate the liquid phase formation and the increase in pore size, resulting in higher porosity and lower bulk density. And the pore structure varies with the addition of FA relatively uniform pore size distribution, high porosity and high compressive strength can be well achieved in this way. Besides, the partial vitrification of ceramic foam materials contributes to an increase in chemical stability while also reducing the risk of environmental pollutions. Here, an excellent performance combination (low bulk density at 0.63 g/cm(3), high porosity at 73.6%, high compressive strength at 9.1 MPa) can be obtained in an optimized condition (15 wt % FA additions, sintering temperature at 1120 degrees C). The finding in this work, we believe, would provide guidance for rational utilization industrial wastes, which based on the synergistic complementarity effect between chemical components.

AB The lime alkaline glaze, originated as early as 1300A.D, is typical of Chinese ancient transparent ceramic glaze in the dynasties of Yuan, Ming, and Qing. Imitation transparent glaze with the composition identical to that of the ancient glaze in the Ming and Qing dynasties was prepared at five different firing temperatures. FTIR spectra of the imitation glaze were analyzed by means of mathematical self-deconvolution, and the assignment of each component band was identified, showing that the glaze, with the increase of firing temperature, presented a higher level of polymerization degree in its network. Imitation glazes were artificially aged through water corrosion and annealing. FTIR decomposition spectra of aged glazes indicate that some silicon-bridging oxygen silicon bonds were hydrolyzed during water corrosion, and that silicon-non-bridging oxygen-alkali bonds increased during low-temperature anneal. Finally, the FTIR results obtained from the artificial aged glazes were compared with those of the ancient glaze of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and aging condition of ancient glazes were inferred.

AB A wide variety of brookite TiO2 synthesis methods have been published over the past several decades, but few studies discuss the underlying mechanism that stabilizes brookite over its stable counterparts, rutile and anatase. Here, we investigate of the effect of pulsed laser deposition parameters on the as-deposited amorphous precursor titania thin films, which subsequently crystallize into stable and metastable TiO2 polymorphs upon annealing. We find that oxygen pressure in the deposition chamber strongly influences the non-equilibrium state of the amorphous precursor, which ultimately allows for selective polymorph formation. Rutile forms as the dominant phase at low pO(2) < 0.1 mTorr, while anatase is favored at high pO(2) > 5 mTorr. Brookite forms primarily at intermediate pO(2) (0.5-1.0 mTorr). Controlling the amorphous structure (i.e. Ti-O bonding and polyhedral arrangement) of the precursors via oxygen deficiency is therefore likely for the selective formation of crystalline TiO2 polymorphs from sub-stoichiometric amorphous precursors. Directing phase selectivity by manipulating the structure and internal energy of the precursor amorphous state may have tremendous potential for synthesis of metastable crystalline phases that exhibit more desirable properties in comparison to their stable counterparts.

AB Europium (Eu3+)-doped zinc-fluorophosphate (PKAZfEu) glasses have been synthesized by usual melt quenching technique. Optical absorption, photoluminescence excitation, photoluminescence and decay curves of these glasses were measured at room temperature and investigated. The Judd-Ofelt (JO) parameters (Omega(lambda), lambda = 2 and 4) were determined from the measured emission spectra and used for quantifying the radiative parameters that include radiative transition probability (A(R)), radiative lifetime (tau(R)), branching ratios (beta(R)), effective bandwidths (Delta lambda(eff)) and peak stimulated emission cross-section (alpha(lambda(p))) for the D-5(0) luminescent state of Eu3+. The electron-phonon coupling strength and phonon energy of the glasses were obtained from the phonon sideband spectrum. The chromaticity coordinates for different concentration of PKAZfEu glasses were evaluated by analyzing the emission spectra with Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE) color diagram. Decay curves of Eu3+ ions for the D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transition have been obtained under 393 nm excitation. The decay curves exhibit a single exponential behavior for all the investigated glasses. Luminescence properties of Eu3+ ion for the D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transition indicate that the PKAZfEu glasses could be a suitable gain medium for visible red lasers and display devices.

AB In graphene oxide (GO) reinforced composite materials, the uniform dispersion of GO and its interaction with matrix is highly desired for better mechanical properties. In order to achieve better interlocking and uniform microstructure, ion interaction approach has been used for the synthesis of GO and bioactive glass ceramics (BGC) composites. Oxygenated functional groups of GO played a decisive role in GO and BGC interlocking and towards the uniform homogeneity of the composite. GO-BGC composites with different GO to BGC weight ratios (0.5 to 2.0 wt.-%) were synthesized via the base-catalyzed sol-gel method and characterized by FTIR, RAMAN, SEM, TGA-DSC, and X-Ray diffraction techniques. An increase in micro-hardness was observed with the addition of GO up to 1 wt.-%, however, further loading led to a decrease in hardness. Moreover, GO-BGC composites were thermally more stable as compared to pristine GO. Bio-mineralization studies showed that composites were bioactive and GO supported the formation of the apatite layer. Furthermore, the composites were cytocompatible as was demonstrated by MTT assay using rat mesenchymal stem cells. This study can provide interesting insights into the synthesis and applications of novel composite biomedical materials.

AB The relationship between glass structure and crystallization behavior has remained elusive, though a general solution would have broad applications. In this work, three-component glasses were studied in the system MTSixO2x+2, where M = Na, Li, or Ca, T = Al, B, or Fe, and x = 1, 2, and 3. These glasses, selected to systematically explore network and modifier substitutions, included mineralogically important silicate chemistries (i.e., albite, jadeite, carnegieite, nepheline, anorthite, eucryptite, spodumene, aegirine, reedmergnerite, malinkoite). Glasses were interrogated using neutrons and synchrotron X-rays, and empirical potential structure refinement (EPSR) modeling was performed to compare the average glass structures to the analogous crystalline references. Through EPSR modeling, it was shown that similarity in the coordination number of the non-network cations in glass systems (i.e., alkali and alkaline earth) predicts which glasses easily crystallize an isochemical phase during cooling from melt. Average coordination number of the M and T type cations of glass versus isochemical crystal is proposed as a metric to predict crystallization. This metric is compared to other proposed metrics such as normalized temperatures, change in density, fragility, and thermodynamic parameters. This the first study to employ EPSR modeling to relate crystallization propensity of isochemical crystals to network modifier short-range order.

AB A set of 12 glass compositions with distinct structural features have been designed over a broad composition space in the per-alkaline region of the Na2O - Al2O3 - SiO2 ternary system. As expected from a per-alkaline system, aluminum has been found to be tetrahedrally coordinated in all the glasses using Al-27 magic angle spinning - nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy and from structure models generated using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The physical properties of glasses, for example, density, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), glass transition, elastic moduli and Vickers hardness and brittleness have been measured experimentally and their trends have been explained based on the atomic structure of glasses, from both simulations and experiments. A reasonable agreement has been observed between the composition - structure - property relationship trends obtained experimentally when compared with those predicted by MD simulations. This demonstrates that MD simulation is a promising technique for predictive modeling and designing novel glass compositions for functional applications.

AB The surface tension of liquid metals depends strongly on atmosphere conditions, in particular on the partial pressure of oxygen, on top of temperature. Predicting the surface tension of metals in different atmosphere conditions is highly desirable for many fundamental and practical applications. Currently, none of the theoretical and semi-empirical approaches reported in the literature can predict accurately the non-metallic impurities (oxygen, sulphur, phosphorous, carbon ...) effect upon the surface tension. These models are mainly descriptive, i.e. they must be adjusted to the experiential datasets. The aim of this work is to fill this gap. A semi-empirical model describing the oxygen effect upon the surface tension of liquid metals is proposed. The key parameter describing this model is the metal recovery rate saturated with oxygen, which can be predicted from crystal. lographic data of the monoxide. For liquid metals where sufficient reliable experimental data is available, the surface tension as a function of oxygen content is predicted using the present theoretical model and compared with experimental data. A very good agreement is found. It is also shown that the proposed model is valid for semiconductors and semimetals and as well.

AB Combined calorimetric and structural study, employing the techniques of differential scanning calorimetry and Raman spectroscopy, was performed to describe the enthalpy relaxation processes in the (GeSe2)(y)(Sb2Se3)(1-y) chalcogenide glasses. The full glass forming compositional region (y = 0.3-0.9) was explored. The enthalpy relaxation was described in terms of the phenomenological Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan model. Compositional evolution of the glass transition temperatures and relaxation activation energies was explained based on the changing average bond energies and overall interconnectivity of the glassy matrices. Resemblance between the activation energies of the relaxation processes and viscous flow was confirmed for all studied glasses. Non-linearity and non-exponentiality of the enthalpy relaxation were found to be invariant with composition. The structural relaxation kinetics as well as kinetic fragilities determined for the present (GeSe2)(y)(Sb2Se3)(1-y) glassy system were very similar to the results obtained earlier for the (GeS2)(y)(Sb2S3)(1-y) glasses, which can be attributed to the similarly constrained topology of the pseudo-binary compositional lines.

AB The effect of temperature on multicomponent chemical diffusion in liquids of the quaternary system CaO - Na2O - Al2O3 - SiO2 has been studied. Diffusion-couple experiments were performed around a central composition of 64.5 wt % SiO2, 13.3 wt % Na2O, 10.8 wt % CaO, 11.4 wt % Al2O3. Experiments were performed for three temperatures far above the glass transition (1200, 1280 and 1360 degrees C), as well as 30 degrees C above the glass transition. Strong multidiffusive effects were observed for all temperatures, with significant uphill diffusion of calcium, demonstrating that uphill diffusion happens close to the glass transition as well as at high temperature. For each temperature, we determined the diffusion matrix of the system and quantified its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which correspond formally to (respectively) exchanges between ions, and associated diffusion coefficients. Little variation of the eigenvectors of the diffusion matrix was observed as a function of temperature, with a dominant eigenvector corresponding to the exchange of sodium with calcium, the two other eigenvectors corresponding to the exchange of calcium with network formers. For the temperature range 1200-1360 degrees C, the eigenvalues of the diffusion matrix have an Arrhenian temperature dependence, with an activation energy consistent with electrical conductivity for the exchange of sodium and calcium, and an activation energy consistent with viscosity for eigenvectors involving network formers. Multicomponent diffusion close to the glass transition is characterized by the same eigenvectors as at higher temperature, but some diffusion profiles are asymmetric due to strong viscosity contrasts resulting in concentration-dependent eigenvalues. Moreover, we observe some departure from Eyring relation close to the glass transition, with diffusion eigenvalues several orders of magnitude greater than the Eyring prediction.

AB In this work, an FeCoBSiNbCu bulk glassy alloy (BGA) with a diameter up to 4 mm was successfully prepared by copper mold casting method. The (Fe0.5Co0.5)(71.6)B20Si4Nb4Cu0.4 BGA exhibits a high strength over 4 GPa and an enhanced plasticity of 3.7%, combined with good soft magnetic properties. A well-developed vein pattern on the fracture surface and highly dense multiple shear bands throughout the overall rod were observed on the deformed specimen. The improved plasticity is strongly related to the nano-scale heterogeneous structure introduced to the glassy alloy by phase separation with minor Cu addition, which can hinder the propagation of shear bands, promote multiple shearing and enhance the plasticity. This work might have a guiding significance for a deep-understanding of the plastic deformation mechanism of Fe-based BGA in a high strength level.

AB Ballistic effects in simple sodium borosilicate (Na2O/B2O3 = 1) and sodium alumino-borosilicate glasses (Na2O - Al2O3/B2O3 = 1) were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, the glasses were irradiated with heavy projectiles that caused atomic displacements by elastic collisions (displacement cascades) and progressively damaged the bulk glass. The accumulated pressure and internal energy inside the glass were found to saturate with deposited energy. Furthermore, structural analysis of the irradiated glasses revealed several important ballistic effects including a decrease in glass density, depolymerization of the borosilicate network, and increase in chemical mixing, short range and intermediate disorder. The magnitude of radiation damage was found to depend on the glass composition and, in general, alumino-borosilicate glasses were found to be slightly less damaged, after irradiation, as compared to borosilicate glasses.

AB Molecular dynamic simulation was used to study mechanism of self-propagating waves of explosive crystallization (devitrification) in the CuTi metallic glass. Processes in thin rectangular samples composed of one to two million atoms were simulated and compared with experimental data. It was shown that the nucleation of primary crystalline clusters occurs homogeneously due to spontaneous fluctuations of atomic structure; the clusters not < 50-100 atoms (similar to 8-10 nm in diameter) have good chance to grow into steady crystalline grain. Self propagating front of crystallization can be initiated locally from one end of the glassy sample; it propagates across the whole sample accompanied by a thermal wave, due to the exothermic effect of devitrification. Temperature rises in the front of this wave from 500 to 550 K up to 665-714 K; the thickness of preheated zone is about 20 nm, the thickness of amorphous-to-crystalline transition zone similar to 1 nm, the propagating velocity is 40 m/s. The uniform heating of the whole sample above 600 K leads to spontaneous nucleation and growth of many crystalline grains, which cause a self-heating of the sample similar to a thermal explosion.

ID MAGNETIC REFRIGERANTS; X=0; NI
AB The fabrication and magnetocaloric effect studies of Fe90-xCoxSc10 (x = 1, 3, 5 and 7) amorphous alloys are reported herein. The addition of Co content can not only tune the Curie temperature of these alloys to room temperature, but also simultaneously increase the maximum value of the magnetic entropy change (-Delta S-m(Pk)). The -Delta S-m(Pk) is 1.40 J/kg K at Delta H = 1.5 T (Delta H: magnetic field change) with x = 7. The maximum refrigerant capacity (RC) is 191.9 J/kg at Delta H = 1.5 T with x = 3, which is higher than that of most of Fe-based amorphous alloys so far discovered. Increasing the Delta H to 2 T, the RC values of these alloys can reach as high as 265.2 J/kg, which is comparable to those detected in crystalline Gd and Gd5Si2Ge2. Enhanced RC values observed in these alloys promise them to be good candidates for near room-temperature magnetic refrigerants.

AB The U.S. Department of Energy immobilizes legacy nuclear high-level waste (HLW) in borosilicate glass. HLW glass with elevated Na2O and Al2O3 concentrations have a demonstrated propensity for precipitating nepheline (NaAlSiO4) during cooling, which adversely affects the waste form performance. Currently, nepheline is suppressed by controlling the HLW glass composition, but this can limit the waste loading and result in longer mission life and cost. Correlation between composition and thermal history experienced during processing with time-temperature relationships that enable nepheline crystal growth would facilitate a more realistic prediction of nepheline crystallization in HLW glass and allow for a wider range of compositions to be accessed. In this work, crystallization behavior in simulated HLW glass was investigated to identify key attributes that lead to nepheline formation, with results indicating that the rate of diffusion for crystal growth may be controlled by glass structure connectivity.

DE Molecular dynamics; SiO2; Glass; Densification; Void; Fcc
ID AMORPHOUS SILICA; HIGH-PRESSURES
AB Molecular dynamics simulation of silica glass has been carried out to investigate the structural transformation in high-pressure densification. The fractions of SiOx (x = 4, 5, and 6) structural units change with the change of density. We found that only corner-sharing bond (one common oxygen atom) appears in the SiO4-SiO4 connectivity, whereas both of corner- and edge-sharing (two common oxygen atom) bonds appear in the SiO5-SiO5 connectivity and three types (corner-, edge- and face- (three common oxygen atom)) of sharing bonds appear in the SiO6-SiO6 connectivity. The first peak splitting of the pair radial distribution function (RDF) G(si-si)(r) is caused by Si atoms linked together via edge- and face-sharing bonds. The new second peak of the pair RDF G(o-o)(r) at the high density originates from oxygen atoms of the edge-sharing bonds. Void analysis indicated that a significant number of O-voids, in which void contacted with four oxygen atoms, exist in the samples. The biggest voids belong to these O-voids. The volume of O-voids changes slightly whereas one of total voids decreases quickly with increasing density. We also found that the density of each SiOx unit type change under high-pressure densification and the density of silica glass can be expressed via the fraction and partial density of SiOx units. Oxygen atoms in the form of hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure are found in the sample of 3.96 g.cm(-3). Both of oxygen hcp and faced centered cubic (fcc) clusters are found in the sample with the density above 3.96 g.cm(-3).

AB Silicon cations with five or six oxygen first neighbors (SiO5 and SiO6, pentacoordinated and hexacoordinated) are known primarily from alkali and alkaline earth silicate glasses melted at pressures up to about 12 GPa, where their formation is thought to be an important part of the densification of the liquid. These species, especially SiO5 groups, have also been proposed as high-energy intermediate structures in the bond-swapping that controls network cation and anion diffusion, and hence viscous transport, in high temperature, silica-rich melts, as well as in low-temperature liquid-state silicate reactions, and have thus been the subject of numerous recent theoretical studies. In spite of this interest, the amount of experimental data on controls of pressure, temperature, and composition on concentrations of penta- and hexacoordinated silicon is very limited. Here we report new results from Si-29 MAS NMR on high pressure glasses with the model composition K2Si4O9, which show that because of transient pressure drop during quench, previous studies probably significantly underestimated SiO5 and SiO6 concentrations. In addition, we refine the earlier results on SiO5 even in 1 bar glasses, and demonstrate a strong increase in its concentration at higher fictive temperature. A positive enthalpy for the reaction forming this species is consistent with its role as an energetically important transition complex in melt dynamics.

AB This paper assesses the effect of alkali concentration on the reaction kinetics and mechanism of fly ash geopolymerization. The kinetic parameters of fly ash with different alkali (6-10 M NaOH) solution have been determined by using heat of reaction data measured at isothermal conduction calorimeter at different reaction temperatures, 34-60 degrees C. With increasing alkali concentration the peak gets intensify and position shifts towards higher time and total heat of reaction enhances. At higher alkali concentration amount of Al and Si dissolute increases, thus, higher energy is required to initiate and forward the reaction. However, the kinetic parameters are varying with alkali, but no alternation is determined in the involved reaction mechanism, nucleation and growth. The apparent activation energy has been evaluated by rate method, suggests three main steps such as dissolution, gel formation and restructuring process of geopolymer reaction. Fly ash geopolymerization is kinetically favored in between 39 and 45 degrees C temperature with all alkali concentration in experimented condition.

AB Point defects in crystalline SiO2, created by 2.5 MeV electron irradiation at dose below the amorphization threshold or by fast neutrons, were compared by luminescence spectroscopy. Oxygen dangling bonds ("non bridging oxygen hole centers", NBOHCs), peculiar to amorphous state of SiO2, were detected for the first time in electron-irradiated non-amorphized alpha-quartz crystal. Their presence may signal the formation of nucleation centers in crystal structure as the first step to radiation-induced amorphization. Compared to crystal, irradiated by 10(19) cm(-2) fast neutrons, their concentration was over 100 times lower, and their inhomogeneous broadening was at least 2.5 times smaller. Divalent silicons ("silicon oxygen deficiency centers", SiODC(II)), inherent to oxygen-deficient or irradiated SiO2 glass, were detected in neutron-irradiated (10(19) n/cm(2)) alpha-quartz but were not found after the electron irradiation. Radiation-induced interstitial O-2 molecules, characteristic to irradiated glassy SiO2 and other oxide glasses, are found in alpha-quartz only after neutron irradiation. The oxygen atoms, displaced by the 2.5 MeV e(-) irradiation of alpha-quartz for fluences up to 10(19) e(-)/cm(2) evidently stays entirely in the peroxy linkage (Si-O-O-Si bond) form.

AB Determination of the glass alteration rate requires the knowledge of the reactive surface area that is a key parameter. Many studies have evaluated this parameter for glass monoliths or powders by using either geometrical or BET surface area, but few have focused on the impact of glass roughness on the reactive surface area and on the global alteration. The roughness can be expected to proportionally increase the reactive surface area and to modify local conditions of alteration. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of surface roughness and asperities on the alteration of a model medieval-type glass. Experiments were performed in aqueous medium on samples with different initial surface roughness level. The results show that, for an initially smooth surface, the altered layer is continuous and tends to scale, whereas for an initially rough surface, the alteration is heterogeneous in morphology and composition and asperities are highly hollowed. Surprisingly, despite these differences, the quantity of altered glass is relatively similar, which shows that the roughness does not significantly increase the reactive surface area. This is explained by a fast solution saturation in asperities that minimizes their contribution to the global alteration.

AB The intense red-emitting Eu3+ doped bismuth germanate glasses have been prepared by melt quenching technique with the chemical composition of (100-x)(0.2Bi(2)O(3)-0.8GeO(2))-xEu(2)O(3) (x = 0.5-2 mol%). Spectroscopic analysis have been performed through FTIR, absorption, luminescence and decay time measurements to enlighten the structural and optical properties of these systems. The bonding parameter (delta) and optical band gap (E-g) of prepared glasses have been calculated from the optical absorption spectra. Phonon side band spectroscopy was used to explore the phonon energy, electron-phonon coupling strength and multiphonon relaxation rate of Eu3+ doped bismuth germanate glasses. Under near UV excitation at 393 nm enhanced red emission is observed at 611 nm (D-5(0) -> F-7(2)) with rising Eu3+ content. The radiative properties including transition probability (A), branching ratio (beta(R)), stimulated emission cross-section (sigma(e)) and decay time (tau(R)) for different excited states have been evaluated by using Judd-Ofelt parameters determined from the emission spectra. The calculated values of asymmetric ratio (R/O) and Omega(2) suggest high asymmetric environment for Eu3+ ions and high covalency for Eu-O bond which are also confirmed by positive values of bonding parameter. The decay curves of D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transition were well fitted to single exponential function for all the concentrations. The slight increase in decay times with rising Eu3+ ion content is due to the increase in the asymmetry of the local environment at the Eu3+ ion site. The CIE color coordinates (x,y) of the prepared glasses are within the range of 0.637-0.648 and 0.347-0.350 and are very close to the standard red color (0.67, 0.33) suggesting pure intense red emission is achieved. The results indicate that BGEx glasses are promising materials for red laser applications.

AB Aluminoborate glasses find use as sealants in numerous energy-storage and biomedical devices. However, a primary shortcoming of this glass family is its chemical durability, particularly when they may be exposed to alkaline (aqueous) environments. The structural features of such glasses, namely the network-modifying elements are thought to regulate such durability, e.g., due to the changes they induce in the coordination of network-forming elements. Herein, by systematic analyses of dissolution rates a proxy for chemical durability - of a wide range of aluminoborate glasses containing network modifiers of diverse field strengths, it is shown that network modifiers affect the atomic topology of the glass network in relation to field strength. This reveals a general scaling of aluminoborate glass dissolution rates as a function of their atomic network's rigidity. The outcomes highlight pathways that could be used to improve the chemical durability of aluminoborate glasses by compositional alterations (i.e., selecting network modifiers) that enhance network rigidity.

AB Although silica aerogel is an excellent thermal insulation material, the poor mechanical property limits its application. The glass fiber reinforced silica aerogel with excellent mechanical property through facile sol-gel process is reported. Innovatively, during the experiments, ethanol was introduced as the main solvent in the water glass based silica sol through ion concentration adjustion to get rid of the conventional solvent exchange. To improve the mechanical property of the product, glass fiber was introduced during the gelation process. Catalyzed by hydrogen chloride, hexamethyldisiloxane was utilized as the modificaton agent. The glass fiber reinforced silica aerogel with low thermal conductivity (0.024 W/m.K) was obtained after ambient pressure drying. Three-point loading tests indicated excellent anti-flexure ability of the as-prepared glass fiber reinforced silica aerogel. Moreover, the entire preparation period can be reduced to similar to 20 h.

AB Bulk samples of single Ag-, Dy-doped and Ag-Dy-codoped silica matrices were synthesized using the sol-gel processing. These matrices were characterized using X-ray diffractometry, ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-VIS-NIR), Fourier transform infrared, photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectroscopic techniques. High resolution transmission electron microscope confirmed the presence of fine spherical Ag nanoparticles (NPs), whose average size is approximately 10-15 nm, in the Ag-doped and Ag-Dy-codoped silica matrices. UV-VIS-NIR spectra revealed absorption peaks due to Dy3+ active centers in addition to the surface plasmon resonance bands of Ag NPs centered at 410 and 452 nm in these matrices, respectively. UV-excited PL of the materials was studied and compared. Near-white light emission, which was assessed by the calculated CIE chromaticity coordinates, could be observed under UV excitation at 365 nm in the Ag-Dy-codoped silica matrix. This white light was realized by appropriate combination of prominent yellow and blue emissions. Electron spin resonance spectra revealed paramagnetic spin states for Ag which can be attributed to the quantum size effect of very fine Ag NPs dispersed in the silica network. The obtained results indicate that the Ag-Dy-codoped silica phosphor could be a promising candidate for application as white light emitting phosphor for UV LED chips.

AB In this present study, we have discussed about the synthesis of spinel type ZnCo2O4 by sol-gel combustion method using glycine as a chelating agent. Structural and morphological verifications are carried out using XRD, SEM and the functional group confirmation by using FT-IR. The temperature dependent dielectric relaxation and conduction mechanism have been analyzed by using dielectric measurements, impedance spectroscopy and electric modulus studies in the frequency range of 50 Hz to 5 MHz between the temperatures 303 K and 593 K. Influence of oxygen vacancy on the behaviour of dielectric relaxation is due to the hopping mechanism between Co2+ and Co3+ sites due to the structural defect in the material. XPS measurement confirms the different oxidation state in Co-site and the existence of oxygen vacancy in the material. The conductivity of the material is studied with Jonscher Power law.

AB We investigate the influence of the ratio between carbon and boron on glass-forming ability, thermal stability and mechanical properties of the Co65Cr13Mo22 ternary eutectic alloy modified by carbon and boron addition. Besides, the correlation between the extension of the supercooled liquid region (SCLR) and three bonding parameters, i.e. electronegativity, atomic size, and valence electron is investigated. The results reveal that carbon is more effective than boron to form a glassy phase in this system, and fully glassy alloys or metallic glass composites can be obtained when the metalloid contents are in the range of 20-25 at.%. Fully glassy alloys are only obtained when the carbon-to-boron ratio is 2:1. The glassy alloys and the glass composites exhibit high strength and extraordinarily wide SCLRs of > 120 K. The width of the SCLR of the Co-based BMGs can be articulated as a function of three bonding parameters, which is different to the relationship previously observed for Fe-, Mg- and Pd-based BMGs. Based on these findings we propose the optimum C/B ratio for glass phase formation and the new criterion for predicting the width of the SCLR of Co-based BMGs by the three bonding parameters.

AB Sixteen glasses of mixed keatite solid solution - cordierite stoichiometry, with 4 mol% TiO2 as nucleating agent, were produced and ceramized to investigate their crystallization sequence. Employed analytical methods included differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Differences were identified already during the first ceramization stages: Al2O3/(Al2O3 + SiO2) and Li2O/(Li2O + MgO) ratios were crucial to determine which seed former phases would precipitate and the nucleation efficiency of each glass, reaching its maximum at Mg-free composition. Metastable formation of high quartz solid solution was observed in all samples; this phase was most persistent at Li2O/(Li2O + MgO) ratio equal to 0.33 and high SiO2-enrichment. Its destabilization led to the appearance of keatite solid solution and/or indialite, whose crystallization sequence and fmal relative amounts, as well as the microstructure of the glass-ceramics, were strongly influenced by the composition of the parent glasses.

AB The relationship between the luminescence properties and the glass structure of Nd3+-doped CaO-Al2O3-(B2O3, SiO2, or Ga2O3) glasses are investigated. The luminescence properties of CaO-Al2O3-B2O3 system are twice as much as that of the CaO-Al2O3-(SiO2 or Ga2O3) system. The glass structure and the coordination environment of the Nd3+ ions were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. All Al, Ga, and Si atoms are four coordinated. The B atoms have three-and four-coordinated boron units, however, most of them are three coordinated. The hyperfine sublevel correlation spectra reveal that the Al and B nuclei are in the coordination sphere of Nd3+ ions for aluminoborate glasses; however, only Al-27 signals could be observed for aluminosilicate and aluminogallate glasses. Owing to the increased number of AlO4-BO3 connections and HB nuclei around the Nd3+ ions, B has a significant effect on the luminescence properties of the Nd3+ ions. The increase in GaO4 or SiO4 does not change the three dimensional-tetrahedral network, and the coordination environment of Nd3+ ions varies slightly. Thus, the effect of Ga2O3 and SiO2 on the luminescence properties of the Nd3+ ions is not as great as that of B2O3.

AB The structure of Ge22Ga3Sb10S65 and Ge15Ga10Sb10S65 glasses was investigated by neutron diffraction (ND), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements at the Ge, Ga and Sb K-edges. Experimental data sets were fitted simultaneously in the framework of the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulation technique. Short range order parameters were determined from the obtained large-scale configurations. It was found that the coordination numbers of Ge, Sb and S are around the values predicted by the Mott rule (4, 3 and 2, respectively). The Ga atoms have on average 4 nearest neighbors. The structure of these stoichiometric glasses can be described by the chemically ordered network model: Ge-S, Ga-S and Sb-S bonds are the most important. Long Sb-S distances (0.3-0.4 angstrom higher than the usual covalent bond lengths) are observed, suggesting that Sb atoms can be found in various local environments.

AB Effect of high-energy dry mechanical milling on medium-range order structure in glassy arsenic sulfide g-As2S3 was studied employing the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis. The results were treated in terms of model assuming appearance of diffuse halo in the XRPD patterns of g-As2S3 known as the FSDP (the first sharp diffraction peak) due to remnants of inter-planar quasi-crystalline correlations with Bragg diffraction spacing approaching similar to 5.1 angstrom, supplemented by the post-FSDP halo at similar to 5.1 angstrom(-1) originated from inter-atomic cation-cation correlations. Thermodynamically stabilized balance in network-forming entities in glass structure was shown to be essentially disturbed under milling, providing an evidence on a variety of defective states with unfavorable potential energies. The inter-planar correlations contributing to the FSDP were essentially disturbed under milling making the correlated distances between atomic pairs belonging to neighboring planes more prominent, like it was detected in chalcogenide glasses under applied hydrostatic pressure. The impact of milling-driven fragmentation on the correlation lengths of quasi-crystalline remnants was confirmed by slight decrease in the FSDP position and, in contrast, noticeable broadening in its width. The non-elementary nature of this peak-halo due to post-FSDP hump became more prominent after high-energy milling. Comparative study of milling-derived g-As45S55 and As50S50 mechanically treated under similar conditions confirmed unique compositional FSDP parameterization in binary g-As-S system.

AB Eu3+ doped transparent glass-ceramics (GCs) containing non-centrosymmetric ferroelastic Ba2TiGe2O8 (BTG) crystals as the major crystalline phase have been synthesized. BTG crystal phase was generated in the glass matrix with mole percent composition 30BaO-15TiO(2)-55GeO(2) synthesized by melt quenching technique followed by controlled crystallization through ceramming heat-treatment. A diffusion controlled surface crystallization event with zero and constant nucleation rates was determined through a comparative study of some linear and nonlinear solid state reaction models. Nonlinear crystallization kinetics studies facilitated determination of the experimental ceramization temperature and time for fabrication of transparent glass-ceramics containing BTG nanocrystals. XRD, FTIR, TEM and FESEM measurements confirmed the dispersion of BTG nanocrystals of size 20-100 nm in the glass matrix. Local crystal environment around Eu3+ ions facilitated the enhancement of photoluminescence of glass-ceramics with respect to the precursor glass. High dielectric constant, low loss and dissipation factors were observed for the GCs.

AB Trivalent samarium (Sm3+)-doped boro-bismuth glass systems are prepared using the well-known melt quenching technique and studied their physical and spectroscopic properties. Theoretical optical basicity of the glasses are evaluated using the glass compositions. The optical absorption spectra are used to predict the optical band gap and bonding parameters of glasses. The ultra violet (UV) cutoff wavelength is increasing towards the higher wavelength side with increase in bismuth concentration. Judd-Ofelt parameters are obtained from absorption spectrum and are inturn used to estimate radiative properties for various excited states of the Sm3+ ions in born-bismuth glasses. Luminescence decay curves of the (4)G(5/2) level in the Sm3+-doped boro-bismuth glasses are measured under 402 nm excitation. The decay times exhibit single exponential nature for lower concentrations (<= 0.1 mol%) and tends towards non-exponential with increase in Sm3+ concentrations (>= 0.5 mol %). The non-exponential decay curves of higher Sm3+-doped glasses are fitted to the Inokuti-Hiriyama model to know the nature of interaction for energy transfer between the Sm3+ ions. The chromaticity color coordinates for present glass systems are also evaluated and found that the luminescence color falls in the reddish-orange region.

AB Oxyfluoride glasses with composition x WO3 - 30 NaPO3 - (70-x) NaF, with 30 <= x <= 70 were prepared by melt quenching and characterized with respect to their bulk physical properties and ionic conductivities. As the NaF content increases, the glass transition temperature, T-g, decreases systematically. Impedance measurements reveal no clear effect of NaF content upon room temperature electrical conductivities and activation energies. There is, however, a significant decrease of the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor with increasing WO3 content, suggesting that the electrical conductivities measured in this glass series are increasingly influenced by an electronic contribution. This contribution may be related to a W5+ -> W6+ electron hopping process detected in the optical absorption spectra. Detailed spectroscopic investigations by Raman scattering and multinuclear one and two-dimensional solid-state NMR experiments indicate that NaF acts like a network modifier resulting in the formation of W-F bonds via breakage of W-O-W and W-O-P linkages, with the former process being the preferred one. The concomitant decrease in network connectivity caused by these processes accounts for the experimentally observed decrease in glass transition temperatures with increasing NaF contents.

AB In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies - including histopathological, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity analyses over the past 25 years have proven the tremendous potential of Biosilicate (R) in appliance as osteoinductive powders, scaffolds and even monolithic pieces. Within continuing efforts to improve the properties of this bioactive material, in this article we explore the structural consequences of incorporating boron in small amounts and its effects on selected properties, as it is known to influence vital processes such as embryogenesis, bone growth, and psychomotor skills, among others. Solid state B-11 MAS NMR studies indicate that in the glassy precursor boron is likely present in the form of three-coordinate pyroborate units, with only minor fractions of four-coordinate species present. In contrast, P-31 MAS-NMR spectra reveal that phosphorus is almost exclusively present in the form of orthophosphate. The demand of the anionic borate network former for cationic charge compensation leads to an increase in average connectivity of the silicate network, as evident from Si-29 MAS NMR. P-31/B-11 dipolar recoupling experiments indicate negligible amounts of borate-phosphate linkages in these glasses, presumably because of the low concentrations of each element. Crystallization of the glassy Biosilicate (R) precursor produces crystalline NaCaPO4 and Na2CaSi2O6 as well as a residual amorphous material for which the fraction of four-coordinate boron is significantly increased and no B-O-P linkages can be detected. Surprisingly, we find that in this particular glass boron reduces the glass stability against crystallization and has only a weak influence upon the TRIS-buffer solution dissolution kinetics.

AB Transparent glass of xEu(2)O(3)-(100-x)TeO2 binary system is obtained by using the melt-quenching method and especially studied for x = 5 in xEu(2)O(3)-(100-x)TeO2 composition. Optical properties such as transmission, excitation, and emission spectra of Eu2O3-TeO2 glass-ceramics are studied and carefully compared for the samples heated at different temperatures. The one step heat-treatment affects the crystallinities as well as phase formation and yields cubic [Eu2Te6O15], orthorhombic [TeO2], and tetragonal [TeO2] phases depending on the heat treating temperature. Glass-ceramics of Eu3+-doped tetragonal [TeO2] shows stronger emission intensity at wavelength of 613 nm with an excitation wavelength of 394 nm compared with that from cubic [Eu2Te6O33] or Eu3+-doped orthorhombic [TeO2]. Enhancement of emission intensity in Eu3+-doped tetragonal [TeO2] is related to the local environment of Eu3+ ions substituted in tetragonal TeO2 lattice.

AB Sm3+-doped zinc magnesium sulfophosphate glasses were synthesized by conventional melt-quench technique. FTIR spectra were recorded to investigate the structural properties of the glasses. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was confirmed the thermal stability of studied glass samples. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy was obtained and J-O analysis was determined to derive the spectroscopic properties of Sm3+ doped zinc magnesium sulfophosphate glasses. Spontaneous radiative transition probabilities (A), radiative lifetimes (tau(R)), branching ratios (beta) for the excited (4)G(5/2) transition level were calculated and discussed. Thirteen absorption peaks were exhibited in the UV-Vis-NIR spectra. Emission spectra exhibited four significant peaks located at 561, 596, 643 and 703 nm which are assigned to the (4)G(5/2)-> H-6(5/2), (4)G(5/2)-> H-6(7/2), (4)G(5/2 ->)(6)H(9/2,) and (4)G(5/2)-> H-6(11/2) transitions, respectively and the intensities of all bands were quenched by addition of ZnSO4 ions contents. The results revealed that the PMS-ZS10 glass matrix has the higher values of branching ratios and emission cross-sections for (4)G(5/2)-> H-6(7/2) transition. It is observed that the Sm3+-doped zinc magnesium sulfophosphate glass can be promise candidate for lasers in the visible range.

ID NONMONOTONIC RELAXATION PROCESSES
AB We show that in a binary solution in the presence of liquid phase of non-permanent composition, and a stoichiometric phase, for solute concentration exceeding some critical value, the instability mathematically described by the Cahn-Hilliard type equation can develop. Within the framework of the model system a dispersion relation is constructed. This relation allows to determine the concentration fluctuations dependence on time, and to investigate dynamics of structural factor and of amplification rate. The observed instability can explain the processes of slow non-monotonic relaxation in the glass-forming metal melts upon melting.

AB The microstructure of amorphous and nanocrystalline Mg65C20Y10Zn5 alloy in as-quenched and post-annealed state was examined using neutron diffraction (ND), Reverse Monte Carlo modeling (RMC) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The surface characteristic of Mg-based glass was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) method. The corrosion activity of alloy in glassy and nanocrystalline state was determined by electrochemical polarization measurements conducted in 15% NaCl solution. It was found that the structure of the melt-spun glass is homogeneous, but some medium-range order (MRO) regions as small as 1-2 nm were observed. The RMC analysis of ND data was used for local atomic structure and coordination numbers of the Mg65C20Y10Zn5 alloy in as-quenched state. The three-dimensional model representing a simulation box with atomic arrangements was also proposed. An average coordination number for Mg-Mg and Mg-Cu atoms is 8.1 and 2.5, adequately. The formation of nanocrystalline structure after annealing was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and HRTEM observations. The TEM and HRTEM techniques allowed to observe regions containing very small particles in the amorphous matrix with size of 4-10 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns allowed to identified hexagonal Mg and orthorhombic Mg2Cu phases. XPS results indicated the co-existence of MgO and Mg(OH)(2) on the surface film formed on glassy ribbon in as-quenched state. The electrochemical polarization measurements revealed that the glassy ribbon exhibited lower corrosion current density than nanocrystalline sample.

AB Structural, electrical, bioactivity and antibacterial properties of mesoporous Ag doped calcium borosilicate glass ceramics are reported. A simple sol-gel route was used to synthesize the mesoporous glass-ceramics. N-2 adsorption-desorption studies reveal the mesoporous structure of the samples. The embedment of nano-sized Ag metallic particles in glass matrix was confirmed for Ag doped sample calcined at 600 degrees C by X-ray diffraction, UV-visible, and transmission electron microscopic analyses. Ac conductivity is used to study the electrical relaxation processes. Ag nanoparticle-embedded sample reveal nearly constant loss behaviour, whereas silver ions alone embedded sample show universal dielectric relaxation behaviour. Ag doped samples exhibit good antibacterial properties without compromising the bone-like apatite layer formation. The antibacterial effect against Gram negative bacteria is higher for Ag doped sample calcined at 600 degrees C which exhibits a dominant nearly constant dielectric loss feature.

AB Borate glasses have gained attention in wound healing applications attributable to their lower chemical durability compared to silicate glasses, allowing for increased degradation rates and potentially accelerated benefits in the healing process. Recently, the sol-gel process was used to fabricate borate glasses with high specific surface areas (SSAs) leading to rapid dissolution and high reactivity when compared to their melt-quench derived equivalents. In this study, silver doped sol-gel derived borate glasses (AgBGs) were developed to impart anti-bacterial properties, thus potentially offering treatment for chronic and infected wounds. In order to optimize glass composition, the sol-gel processing route was adapted to generate two different AgBG compositional ranges; (46)B2O3-(27)CaO-(24-X)Na2O-(3)P2O5-(X)Ag2O where X = 0, 0.15, 0.5 and 1 (mol%) and (60)B2O3-(36)CaO-(4-X)P2O5-(X)Ag2O where X = 0, 0.3, 0.5 and 1 (mol%). It was demonstrated that the latter, sodium free formulation resulted in enhanced silver incorporation with high SSA (237-300 m(2)/g) and small pore width (31-44 angstrom) values. XRD and ATR-FTIR were used to verify the amorphous nature of the glasses and the presence of BO3 and BO4 units as the glass network former, respectively. Extent of silver ion release from the dissolution of AgBG in deionized water verified its dependency on the processing route and glass composition. Additionally, the anti-bacterial activity of AgBGs against Escherichia cob and Staphylococcus aureus was correlated with silver ion release. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the potential use of anti-bacterial sol-gel derived AgBGs for potential wound healing applications.

AB Haemonchus contortus constitutes a severe problem for ruminant's production, it is the most frequent nematode parasite both in template and tropical regions, induces economical losses, and shows increasing resistance to currently available anthelmintics. Tannins are secondary metabolites that naturally fulfill defense functions in plants, representing a non-conventional, natural alternative in the treatment of gastrointestinal parasites in sheep. The objective of this work was to explore the in vitro anthelmintic activity of hydrolysable tannins on adult stage of Haemonchus contortus. Adults nematodes were obtained directly from the abomasum of ovines, and a dose response curve was performed with tannins extract at 0, 2, 4, 8, 25 and 50 mg/mL, and a time response curve at 0.5, 1, 2 and 24 h at 37 degrees C. Hydrolysable tannins decreased motility and induced mortality of H. contortus. We observed cuticle disruption around the mouth and reproductive organs, as well as evisceration. After 24 h of exposition, 8 mg/mL induced 83% of mortality and with 25 mg/kg 100% of mortality was achieved. The LD50 was 3.54 mg/mL, while LD90 was 10 mg/mL. We propose hydrolysable tannins as an alternative to contribute in the nematode control in ruminants.

AB The anthelmintic activity of an injectable eprinomectin formulation (Eprecis (R) 20 mg/mL) was evaluated in 150 naturally infected dairy sheep raised in 3 semi-intensive flocks. All ewes were at the same stage of lactation and grazed on natural pastures. Ewes did not receive any anthelmintic treatment for at least 4 months prior to the experiment. In each flock, 50 ewes were selected and randomly allocated to control (C) or treatment (T) groups (n = 25 per group). Groups were balanced according to the ewes' bodyweight (BW) and fecal egg count (FEC) measured seven days before eprinomectin administration (day-7). On study day 0, ewes in group T, received 0.2 mg/kg BW of eprinomectin subcutaneously (Eprecis (R) 20 mg/mL, Ceva). Ewes in group C were left untreated. Fecal samples were collected on day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-treatment to assess FEC and for coprocultures. Ewes were weighed on day 0 and 28. Overall and within-flock efficacy of eprinomectin was calculated throughout the experimental period. No local or general adverse reaction after injection was observed. The most prevalent parasite genera were Teladorsagia, Haemonchus and Trichostrongylus. Following treatment, the overall mean FEC of C and T groups differed significantly (P < 0.001). Overall and within-flock efficacy of eprinomectin was 99.8%-100.0% and 99.7%-100.0%, respectively. Contrary to C group, ewes treated with injectable eprinomectin increased their BW during the study ( - 0.5 kg vs. + 1.5 kg, P < 0.001). In this field study, a single subcutaneous injection of eprinomectin to dairy sheep, at 0.2 mg/kg BW, resulted in excellent curative anthelmintic activity; egg counts remain low for at least 28 days after treatment.

AB Giardia intestinalis and Tritrichomonas foetus are frequent enteric protozoan parasites of the gastrointestinal track of domestic cats. Because of different treatment options for the parasites, confirmation of presence of one or both pathogens is necessary. The PCR based assays are suitable for differential diagnosis. We evaluated the performance of Small Animal Diarrhoea panel, a multiplexed-tandem real-time PCR (MT-PCR) assay, that detects DNA of both G. intestinalis and T. foetus. The sensitivity and specificity were compared to reference real-time PCR assays using 105 faecal samples, 39.05% (n = 41) positive for G. intestinalis and 30.48% (n = 32) were positive for T. foetus. The faecal samples positive for T. foetus had a high proportion of late amplifiers, determined by an arbitrary threshold of C-t -values > 35. On the other hand, only one G. intestinalis positive sample was considered a late amplifier. For G. intestinalis DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 95.1% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity. For T. foetus DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 41.9% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity. To evaluate the interlaboratory reproducibility of the MT-PCR assay, results were compared in two different laboratories and found to be in a very good agreement (Kappa = 0.9). Further analysis of the DNA using conventional PCR determined presence of G. intestinalis Assemblage F and T. foetus genotype 'feline'. In conclusion, the MT-PCR Small Animal Diarrhoea panel had a good and poor performance against reference assays for G. intestinalis and T. foetus, respectively. The assay is suitable for detection and differential diagnosis of G. intestinalis and moderate to high burdens of T. foetus in small animal clinical practice.

AB In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to assess whether Eimeria tenella (E. tenella) oocysts, exposed to low energy electron irradiation (LEEI), might be considered potential vaccine candidates against cecal coccidiosis. Sporulated oocysts were exposed to LEEI of 0.1 kGy to 10.0 kGy. Reproduction inhibition assays (RIA) were performed in MDBK cells to assess infectivity of sporozoites excysted from irradiated and non-irradiated oocysts. LEEI of 0.1 kGy or 0.5 kGy resulted in 73.2% and 86.5% inhibition of in vitro reproduction (%I-RIA), respectively. Groups of 12 one day old (D1) chicken were orally inoculated with Paracox (R)-8 (G1), 2.0 x 10(3) non-irradiated oocysts (G2) or 1.0 x 10(4) irradiated oocysts exposed to LEEI of 0.1 kGy (G3, G4) or 0.5 kGy (G5). Chicken of groups Gl, G2, G4 and G5 were challenged 3 weeks later (D21) by a single inoculation of 7.5 x 10(4) non-attenuated oocysts of the same strain while G3 remained unchallenged. All chickens were subject to necropsy 7 days after challenge (D28) to estimate lesion scores (LS) and oocyst index (OD. A positive control (PC, nonvaccinated, challenged) and a negative control (NC, non-vaccinated, non-challenged) were kept in parallel. Chicken of group G5 had similar weight gain as the Paracoe-8 group (G1) after challenge and higher weight gains as compared to the other vaccinated groups. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) did not differ between chickens inoculated with oocysts irradiated with 0.5 kGy (G5) and negative control (NC) before challenge (1.25-1.52). After challenge FCR was 1.99 (G5) to 2.23 (G4) in the vaccinated chicken compared to 1.76 in group NC. LS and GI were significantly lower in all vaccinated groups as compared to group PC. Progeny oocysts collected from the feces of chickens following vaccination with irradiated oocysts exhibited lower in vitro infectivity/reproduction in MDBK cells with %I-RIA of 89.7% and 82.4% for progeny of oocysts irradiated with 0.5 kGy and 0.1 kGy, respectively, suggesting hereditary attenuation by LEEI treatment. Seroconversion was demonstrated by ELISA before challenge (D21) in all vaccinated groups, however, chicken inoculated with irradiated oocysts displayed higher antibody levels than those inoculated with precocious oocysts (G1). In Western blot analysis chicken vaccinated with virulent (G2) or 0.1 kGy-irradiated E. tenella oocysts (G3, G4) showed more protein bands compared to G5 (0.5 kGy). We conclude that LEEI could be a promising technology for production of attenuated oocyst vaccines.

AB The metastrongyloid nematode Aelurostrongylus abstrusus is a worldwide occurring feline lungworm. The spectrum of clinical signs in infected cats ranges from mild (e.g. nasal discharge or cough) to severe respiratory distress. The aim of this seroepidemiological study was to define prevalence and risk factors for A. abstrusus infections in Swiss cats, to assess the biogeographic distribution and to investigate the influence of temperature and altitude on the occurrence of this parasite. Sera of 4067 domestic cats were collected from all over Switzerland, tested for the presence of antibodies against A. abstrusus by a novel ELISA and the results correlated with biogeographic aspects. A subsample of 1000 datasets was used for risk factor analyses. Overall, 10.7% (434/4067, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 9.7-11.7%) of the cats were tested positive, with variations from 0.0% to 20.0% among ten different biogeographic regions. Differences were significant between the Western (13.9%, CI: 11.4-16.7%) and the Eastern (9.2%, CI: 8.0-10.5%) Swiss Plateau, possibly attributable to the suitability of the areas for intermediate hosts. In total 90.3% (392/434) of the seropositive cats originated from regions lower than 700 m above sea level. Correspondingly, 98.9% (429/434) of positive samples were obtained from regions with a mean temperature higher than - 2 degrees C in January, suggesting altitude and temperature being limiting factors for A. abstrusus infections in Switzerland. Concerning individual risk factors, prevalence was higher in intact (15.5%, CI: 9.5-23.4%) than in neutered cats (5.8%, CI: 7.9-10.4%). Young adult cats (aged 11-22 months) were significantly more often seropositive (10/76, 13.2%, CI: 6.5-22.9%) than kittens aged 1-10 months (1/34, 2.9%, CI: 0.1-15.3%) or adult and senior cats > 22 months (58/889, 6.5%, CI: 5-8.4%). Outdoor cats and cats presenting respiratory signs tend to be more often positive than indoor cats (p = 0.077) and animals without respiratory signs (p = 0.086), respectively. We here confirm that the use of a serological test can contribute to improve the identification of infected animals, through evaluation of risk factors on a population level and for a better management on an individual level, overcoming the challenges represented by faecal examinations and the correlated underestimation of the occurrence of A. abstrusus in cats.

AB Until 1970, coccidian parasites of dogs were considered to have a direct fecal-oral life cycle like Eimeria in poultry. They were thought to be non-host specific and infect both dogs and cats. Studies conducted in the 1970s revealed that dog coccidia were host-specific and had transport or paratenic hosts that were infected with an encysted stage containing a single organism, the monozoic tissue cyst. There are still considerable confusion and uncertainties concerning the life cycles and pathogenicity of coccidian parasites of dogs. The present paper reviews the history, taxonomy, life cycles, pathogenicity, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of conventional coccidian parasites previously called Isospora spp., currently designated Cystoisospora spp. that infect canines.

AB In this study, the acaricidal effect of eugenol was measured and its mechanism of action investigated. The results showed that eugenol possessed the effect of killing Psoroptes cuniculi, and could regulate the mRNA expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST), catechinic acid (Ca) and thioredoxin (Trx). PPAR, NF-kappa B, TNF, Rap 1 and Ras signaling pathways might be the main pathways that involved into the process of killing mites. These findings suggested that eugenol could be developed into a new kind of acaricide, and further expand current knowledge on the mechanisms of eugenol for killing Psoroptes cuniculi of eugenol.

AB Trypanosoma evansi, a haemo-flagellated protozoan parasite causes chronic wasting disease in a wide range of animals. For its diagnosis, blood smear examination is useful in clinical cases for direct identification of the parasite but in latent infection the carrier animals are difficult to screen out by conventional blood smear test. Harboring low level of parasites and showing no symptom, the carrier animals for surra can act as a source of infection. The level of parasitaemia fluctuates, especially during latent infection; moreover the antibodies which are not found early in the infection may persist even after recovery or chemotherapy. In the present study a double antibody sandwich ELISA exploring, monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune serum, raised against recombinant variable surface glycoprotein has been developed to detect circulating trypanosome antigens. The developed antigen detection ELISA (Ag-ELISA) was evaluated using 652 blood samples collected from cattle, buffalo, equine and camel. The statistical analysis of the data showed diagnostic sensitivity and specificity at 97.4% and 96.4% respectively, with a positive-negative cut-off OD value > 0.28. Furthermore, the detection limit of the assay was found to 7.15 trypanosomes per mL. The present finding revealed that the developed assay can be exploited as a potential diagnostic test in the detection of circulating trypanosome antigens and also can be used as a population screening test for multiple animal species for detection of active infection for further treatment and control of the disease.

AB Targeted selective treatment (TST) aims to aid in the control of gastrointestinal nematodes in small ruminants, identifying animals that require treatment with the purpose of preserving the Refugia population and delaying the buildup of anthelmintic (AH) resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of both productive and clinical indicators in the selective treatment of gastrointestinal parasites in growing lambs. Two experiments were carried out between 2015 and 2016. Experiment 1: lambs (n = 70) exclusively raised on pasture were evaluated from the ages of 60 days to 180 days old. Experiment 2: lambs (n = 48) raised on pasture and fed concentrated commercial supplementation were evaluated from the ages of 60 days to 150 days old. Parasitological (eggs per gram of feces - EPG), productive (average daily weight gain - DWG), and clinical (hematocrit - Ht and FAMACHA(C) system - F) parameters were measured every 14 days. The lambs were divided into 4 experimental groups with different criteria for AH treatment: the control group (CG), was treated with AH every 30 days; the FAMACHA(C) group (FG), in which lambs classified as F3, F4, and F5 were treated with AH; Daily weight gain group (DWGG), in which lambs with average DWG the average DWG of the CG minus one standard deviation were treated with AH; FAMACHA(C) + daily weight gain group (FDWGG), in which lambs classified as F3, F4 and F5 and/or lambs with average DWG <= the average DWG of the CG minus one standard deviation were treated with AH. In experiment 1, no significant differences in the general means of DWG and Ht (p > 0.05) were observed between experimental groups, although the lowest mean EPG was observed in the CG (p < 0.05). In experiment 2, the lowest mean EPG (p < 0.05) was also observed in the CG (1044.5 EPG), and the highest mean (p < 0.05) in the FG (4845.5 EPG). There were differences in the mean DWG of the CG (198.4 g) and FDWGG (200.0 g), which were both higher (p < 0.05) than that of the FG (90.5 g), and similar (p > 0.05) to the DWGG (151.8 g). In both experiments, considering the total mean number of AH treatments, FG had the lowest number of lambs treated with AH (p < 0.05), with the DWG and FDWGG being similar to each other (p > 0.05). Even when Haemonchus is the major parasite, it is not recommended to use the FAMACHA(C) system as an exclusive criterion for TST in growing lambs. The DWG productive criterion can be used effectively in the TST of growing lambs.

AB We evaluated the comparative plasma disposition kinetics and efficacy of moxidectin (MXD), administered by the intraruminal (IR) or subcutaneous (SC) route at two different dosage levels (0.2 and 1 mg/kg) in feedlot calves. Additionally, the efficacy was compared to an ivermectin (IVM, SC administration) treated group. This study was divided into two separate studies, the "Pharmacokinetic (PK) study" and the "Efficacy study". The "PK study" involved 24 calves free of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN), which were allocated into 4 groups (n = 6) and treated with MXD by either the SC or the IR route at the therapeutic (MXDSC0.2, MXDIR0.2, respectively) or at fivefold the therapeutic dose (MXDSC1.0, MXDIR1.0, respectively). Blood samples were collected from 3 h up to 14 days post-treatment. MXD concentrations in plasma samples were analyzed by HPLC. The "Efficacy study" included 125 calves naturally infected with GIN, which were allocated into five experimental groups (n = 25 each); the same four MXD-treated groups described for the "PK study", and an additional group treated by the SC route with IVM (IVMSC0.2). The efficacy of IVM given at its therapeutic dose and the different MXD groups at the therapeutic and fivefold the therapeutic dose was calculated by analysis of the individual efficacy using the package eggCounts-2.1-1' on the R software environment, version 3.5.0 (R Core Team, 2018). Daily weight gain (DWG) was also measured over the first 47 days of the fattening cycle. Independently of the administration route, MXD peak plasma concentration (C-max) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were higher in groups treated with the higher dose (1.0 mg/kg), whereas a longer time to reach C-max (T-max) was observed after the IR treatments. The observed MXD efficacies were 85% (MXDSC0.2), 94% (MXDSC1.0), 84% (MXDIR0.2) and 99% (MXDIR1.0), at day + 27. At day + 27, all MXD-treated groups showed higher efficacies than the group having received IVM (45%). The post-treatment Cooperia spp. L-3 counts were particularly low in the groups MXDSC1.0 and MXDIR1.0. All of the groups treated with MXD showed better DWG than the IVMSC0.2 group (P = 0.01). Dose and administration route modifications effectively improved the anthelmintic and productive performance of MXD. A high dose of MXD improved the control of IVM-resistant GIN in feedlot calves. However, this practice must be taken with caution, since MXD resistance could rapidly emerge, especially in grazing cattle.

AB Toxascaris leonina (Ascarididae) is a cosmopolitan and polyxenical parasite whose host are canids and felids. To date, molecular phylogenetic studies included toxascarid representatives collected only from dogs or felids, therefore the intra-species differences between T. leonina collected from different host species has not been noticed. In this paper, we test the hypothesis of cryptic speciation in the T. leonina complex based on extended sequence data (ITS1, nad1, cox1) and individuals collected from dogs, felids and foxes. Phylogenetic analysis clustered T. leonina representatives into three well-supported clades depending on their host species, i.e. dogs and wolves, wild felids and foxes. Both genetic distances and the barcoding-gap analysis strongly support the species status of populations inhabiting different hosts. The results suggest additional genetic separation in felids. However, to determine the actual size of the Toxascaris complex, it would be necessary to analyse individuals collected from other canid and felid Toxascaris leonine host species.

AB Cystic echinococcosis is of great public health importance. Surgery is the efficient treatment for this infection. To minimize the risk of cyst intraoperative leakage, using scolicidals is crucial. To date, any efficacious scolicidal without side effect has not been introduced. Since essential oils of Pelargonium roseum and Ferula gummosa have shown several bioactivities, we evaluated their potential against protoscoleces of E. granulosus using albendazole as positive control. Furthermore, chemical composition of both essential oils was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses, and their main constituents were also evaluated for scolicidal activity. Different concentrations of essential oils and their two main constituents were tested for scolicidal activity. Mortality rate was measured by eosin staining. Results of GC-MS revealed citronellol and beta-pinene as the main constituents of P. roseum and F. gummosa essential oils, respectively. After 60 min of exposure to 50 mu g/mL of P. roseum and F. gummosa, mean mortality rate of protoscoleces was 100%. However, beta-pinene and citronellol at the same time point with only 10 mu g/mL concentrations resulted in approximately higher than 80% mortality. Essential oils of P. roseum and F. gummosa showed significant toxic effect on E. granulosus with 50% lethal concentration (LC50) values of 8.52 and 17.18 mu g/mL, respectively. Based on the LC50 values, beta-pinene (2.20 mu g/mL) was the most potent scolicidal agent in the present study. The overall toxicity of beta-pinene and citronellol was significantly higher than the whole essential oils of F. gummosa and P. roseum. Based on these results, beta-pinene and citronellol can be considered as candidate ingredients for the development of green scolicidals.

AB This study aimed to assess in vitro the transmission potential of T. saginata eggs stored in different media at various temperatures, and to optimize recovery, hatching and activation methods. A total of 42 freshwater and 42 silt samples were spiked with 100 mu l of a T. saginata egg suspension, of which half were stored at 5 degrees C and the other half at 20 degrees C. Additionally, 5 silt and 35 tap water control samples were included. Eggs were obtained from gravid proglottids passed by a human carrier following treatment. The duration of the experiment was 6 months, with three sampling time points at 2, 4 and 6 months, respectively (Study 1). In addition, two pilot studies were carried out. One included 8 samples kept in a freshwater stream for a period of 2 and 4 months, respectively, from December 2016 until February 2017 (Study 2). Another study used 6 water samples which were stored for one week in the freezer at -18 degrees C, and 6 samples that were stored outdoor from 7 to 14 February, at temperatures ranging from - 6 degrees C to 5 degrees C (Study 3). To assess survival of T. saginata eggs, recovery, hatching and activation methods were optimized. Taenia saginata eggs could be activated after 6 months of storage in water and silt at 5 degrees C. Storage at 20 degrees C significantly decreased activation of the eggs, to 4 months when stored in water and 2 months when stored in silt. Furthermore, degenerative changes in oncospheres were observed when eggs were stored at 20 degrees C, which were associated with an increased loss of oncospheres during activation. Eggs could be activated after 4 months of storage in the stream at temperatures ranging from - 10 degrees C to 17 degrees C, as well as after one week of constant freezing at - 18 degrees C, or repeated freezing and thawing from - 6 degrees C to 5 degrees C. This study indicates that T. saginata eggs can survive a Northern European winter, and thus pose a significant risk of transmission, and that in vitro activation is a more accurate method for assessing the transmission potential of T. saginata eggs, than recovery, integrity and hatching. Studies will be needed to assess how accurate the in vitro activation correlates to in vivo infectivity to ensure an accurate assessment of the transmission potential at a larger scale for surveillance purposes.

AB Central nervous system (CNS) is the main site for encystment of Neospora caninum in different animal species. In this tissue, glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) modulate responses to aggression in order to preserve home-ostasis and neuronal function. Previous data showed that when primary cultures of glial cells are infected with N. caninum, they develop gliosis and the immune response is characterized by the release of TNF and IL-10, followed by the control of parasite proliferation. In order to elucidate this control, three enzymatic systems involved in parasite-versus-host interactions were observed on a model of neuron/glia co/cultures obtained from rat brains. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) responsible for the catabolism of tryptophan and arginine, respectively, and cycloxigenase (COX) were studied comparing their modulation by respective inhibitors with the number of tachyzoites or the immune response measured by the release of IL-10 and TNF. Cells were treated with the inhibitors of iNOS (1.5 mM L-NAME), IDO (1 mM 1-methyl tryptophan), COX-1 (1 mu M indomethacin) and COX-2 (1 mu M nimesulide) before infection with tachyzoites of N. caninum (1:1 cell: parasite). After 72 h of infection, immunocytochemistry showed astrogliosis and a significant increase in the number and length of neurites, compared with uninfected co-cultures, while an increase of IL-10 and TNF was verified. N. caninum did not change iNOS activity, but the inhibition of the basal levels of this enzyme stimulated parasite proliferation. Additionally, a significant increase of about 40% was verified in the IDO activity, whose inhibition caused 1.2-fold increase in parasitic growth. For COX-2 activity, infection of cultures stimulated a significant increase in release of PGE(2) and its inhibition by nimesulide allowed the parasitic growth. These data indicate that iNOS, IDO and COX-2 control the proliferation of N. caninum in this in vitro model. On the other hand, the release of IL-10 by glia besides modulating the inflammation also allow the continuity of parasitism.

AB Canine babesiosis caused by Babesia canis sensu stricto became an emerging disease of dogs across Europe calling for attention also in countries where it was an only rare imported disease. An easy accessibility of molecular methods and the growing amount of sequencing data led to the description of intraspecific variability in 18S rDNA sequences designated as "genotypes". Using material from a homogenous cohort of dogs with microscopically confirmed canine babesiosis caused by B. canis, we evaluated Babesia intraspecific variability and amplification sensitivity of three different genes (18S rDNA, COI, Cytb) to assess their potential as diagnostic or phylogenetic markers. In raw sequencing data obtained, we observed at least 3 ambiguous positions in up to 86% of chromatograms within the -560 bp fragment of 18S rDNA suggesting the existence of several, not identical copies of this gene. Our COI haplotype analysis resulted in a star-like pattern indicating a recent origin of most haplotypes, but not supporting the existence of two dominant haplotypes. Similarly, the Cytb sequences obtained from samples with all variants of 18S rDNA were identical. We corroborate previous observations from three other European countries and bring the evidence of the existence of 18S rDNA paralogs in B. canis genome replacing currently used "genotype" theory.

AB Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is associated with an unrelenting urge to move at night, which can cause chronic sleeplessness, depression, and despondency; thus increasing risk of suicide. We aimed to determine frequency of suicidal ideation and behavior in RLS.
   Methods: RLS and control participants were recruited through community and RLS Foundation advertisements. RLS diagnosis was confirmed using the Cambridge-Hopkins RLS Questionnaire and severity was assessed using the International RLS Study Group Severity Scale (IRLSS). Lifetime suicidal ideation (plan) and behavior (attempt) was assessed using the Suicidal Behavior Questionnaire-revised. The Brief Lifetime Depression Scale evaluated lifetime depression history. Forward stepwise logistic regression determined the odds of suicidal ideation or behavior.
   Results: In this study, 192 RLS and 158 control participants were comparable for age, sex, race, and other potential demographic confounders. In general, RLS was moderate-to-severe (mean IRLSS 26.4 +/- 7.5). Significantly more RLS than control participants had lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior (27.1% vs. 7.0%; p < 0.00001) or lifetime depression history (65.6%% vs. 22.8%; p < 0.00001). The odds of having a lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior was higher in those with RLS [2.80 (1.29,6.11)], even after accounting for depression and other confounders. In RLS, the odds of lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior was increased if there was lifetime depression [7.37 (2.65,20.47)] or if RLS in the past was severe or very severe [2.36 (1.03,5.40)].
   Conclusions: Lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior is prevalent in RLS sufferers, and its likelihood is dependent on RLS severity and depression history. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to analyze the relationship between the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and heart rate variability (HRV) in a group of patients with clinical suggestion of OSA.
   Methods: 104 patients with clinical suspicion of OSA were qualified to participate in the study (age: 53.15 +/- 13.43 years). All participants took part in a survey and were subjected to laboratory tests, 24-hour ECG Holter monitoring, and polysomnography. The participants were divided into groups depending on the criterion of the presence of OSA.
   Results: The analysis of time HRV demonstrated lower parameters of SDNN for the entire recording and a 15-minute fragment of daily activity, as well as a lower pNN50 for the entire recording in those patients with diagnosed OSA. A statistically significant difference was observed for the spectral analysis of the LF/HF which was higher in the participants with OSA during the 15-minute fragment of N3 sleep. A negative correlation was observed between AHI and the following parameters: SDSD from the entire Holter recording (r = -0.21, p < 0.05) and from the 15-minute fragment of daily activity (r = -0.19, p < 0.05), mRR from the fragment of N3 sleep (r = -0.19, p < 0.05) and VLF from the entire Holter recording (r = -0.26, p < 0.05). A statistically significant positive correlation between AHI and LF/HF in 15-minute fragments of N3 sleep was found (r = 0.26, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The study group of patients with OSA is characterized by reduced HRV. The higher AHI constitutes an independent predictor of reduced HRV, both in the sympathetic and parasympathetic components, and the sympathetic-parasympathetic balance. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Little is known about whether sleep space impacts toddler sleep outcomes. We examined the prevalence of crib-sleeping and its association with caregiver-reported sleep patterns and problems in a large sample of toddlers from Western countries.
   Methods: Participants were caregivers of 1983 toddlers ages 18.0-35.9 months (51.7% male; mean age 25.3 months) from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States sleeping in a crib or bed in a separate room from caregivers. Caregiver-reported sleep patterns and problems were collected via a free, publicly available child sleep smartphone application.
   Results: Across countries/regions, rates of crib-sleeping decreased linearly with age, with 63.4% of toddlers ages 18.0-23.9 months, 34.3% of toddlers ages 24.0-29.9 months, and 12.6% of toddlers ages 30.0-35.9 months sleeping in a crib. Across age groups and countries, crib sleeping was significantly associated with an earlier bedtime, shorter sleep onset latency, fewer night awakenings, longer stretches of time asleep, increased nighttime sleep duration, and decreased bedtime resistance and sleep problems. The duration of night awakenings did not significantly differ by sleep space.
   Conclusion: Sleeping in a crib instead of a bed is associated with enhanced caregiver-reported sleep quantity and quality for toddlers in Western countries. Consistent with practice recommendations, deferring the crib-to-bed transition until age 3 years may benefit toddlers' sleep in Western contexts. Additional research is needed to identify the impact of sleep space on child sleep in other countries/regions. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Although epidemiological evidence suggests that short sleep duration may affect renal function, the influence of long sleep and risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is unclear. We examined the association between sleep duration and risk of ESRD.
   Methods: We investigated sleep duration and ESRD risk in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a prospective population-based cohort of 63,257 Chinese in Singapore, who were aged 45-74 years at recruitment (1993-1998). Information on daily sleep duration (including naps), diet, medical history and other lifestyle factors was collected at recruitment from in-person interviews. ESRD cases were identified via linkage with the nationwide Singapore Renal Registry through year 2014. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression method to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of ESRD in relation to sleep duration.
   Results: After an average 16.8 years of follow-up, 1143 (1.81%) ESRD cases were documented. Sleep duration had a U-shaped association with risk of ESRD (P for quadratic trend < 0.001). Compared with participants with 7 h/day of sleep, the multivariable adjusted HR (95% CI) of ESRD was 1.43 (1.18-1.74) for short sleep (<= 5 h/day) and 1.28 (1.03-1.60) for long sleep duration (>= 9 h/day). The increased risk was stronger in participants with more than 10 years of follow-up compared to those with shorter follow-up time, especially for long sleep (P for interaction = 0.003).
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that both short and long sleep durations were associated with a higher risk of ESRD in this Asian population. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: It remains uncertain whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy would significantly impact hard clinical outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of CPAP in survival and secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events in patients with OSA and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Methods: PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, LILACS, and SciElo databases (up to January 2018) were searched for randomized trials that compared CPAP with no active treatment in adults with OSA and CVD. The primary outcomes were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and any major cardiovascular event. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as the effect measures for dichotomous data, and weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI for continuous variables. We used the random-effects method for meta-analysis.
   Results: Nine trials involving 3314 patients contributed data for meta-analysis of at least one outcome. The duration (median) of CPAP treatment varied from one month to 56.9 months. The pooled RR (95% CI) was 0.86 (0.60-1.23, I-2 = 0.0%) for all-cause death, 0.58 (0.19-1.74, I-2 = 47%) for cardiovascular death, 1.11 (0.76-1.62, I-2 = 0.0%) for myocardial infarction, 0.77 (0.46-1.28, I-2 = 16%) for stroke, and 0.93 (0.70 -1.24, I-2 = 49%) for any major cardiovascular event. The quality of evidence for these outcomes was low.
   Conclusions: Low-quality evidence suggests that CPAP therapy does not significantly improve survival or prevent major cardiovascular events in adults with OSA and cardiovascular disease. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess the diurnal melatonin, cortisol, and activity/rest levels, as well as sleep quality, in patients with and without nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR).
   Methods: We included 25 diabetic patients with DR and 29 without DR. A total of 21 healthy subjects constituted the control group. We assessed the circadian rhythm by actigraphy and diurnal salivary melatonin and cortisol measurements. Sleep quality was evaluated by actigraphy and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaires. Light exposure was quantified by actigraphy. The primary outcome was peak salivary melatonin level. Secondary outcomes were mean melatonin and cortisol levels during dark hours, activity-rest rhythm, sleep quality, as well as level of white, red, green, and blue light exposure.
   Results: Peak melatonin concentration at 04: 00 and mean nocturnal melatonin level were significantly reduced in all diabetic patients, regardless of retinopathy stage (p < 0.001). Levels of light exposures during dark hours were not significantly different in patients with and without DR and healthy controls. Only patients with DR showed increased intradaily variability in their activity-rest interval, indicating circadian misalignment (p = 0.04). Neither the objective actigraphic sleep quality parameters nor the subjective PSQI or ESS scores were significantly different between healthy controls and diabetic patients.
   Conclusions: Reduced nocturnal melatonin concentration and increased fragmentation of activity-rest intervals revealed circadian rhythm disturbance in diabetic patients with DR. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). In most typically developing children with OSAS, more obstructive apneas and hypopneas occur during rapid eye movement (REM) than during non-REM (NREM) sleep. It was hypothesized that patients with PWS are even more prone to obstructive events in REM sleep than otherwise healthy subjects with OSAS.
   Methods: Polysomnographic data of patients with PWS and of typically developing children (controls) with OSAS (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] > 1 episode/h) were analyzed. The two groups were compared regarding obstructive AHI (OAHI), OAHI during NREM sleep (OAHInrem), OAHI during REM sleep (OAHIrem), and the OAHIrem/OAHI ratio (outcome measures). The association between PWS diagnosis and OAHIrem/OAHI was adjusted for confounders using a general linear model.
   Results: Twelve children with PWS (median age 7.1 years [interquartile range 3.5, 12.4 years]) and 53 controls (6.5 years [3.9, 8.7 years]) were studied. Children with PWS and controls were similar regarding OAHI (p = 0.21) and OAHInrem (p = 0.76). However, subjects with PWS had higher OAHIrem (17.6 episodes/h [5.8, 25.8 episodes/h]) and OAHIrem/OAHI (2.3 [1.5, 3.2]) than controls (5 episodes/h [1.5, 8.1 episodes/h]; p = 0.002 and 1 [0.5, 2]; p = 0.003, respectively). The association between PWS diagnosis and higher OAHIrem/OAHI persisted after adjustment for age, gender, and obesity (p = 0.009).
   Conclusion: In children with PWS, OAHI calculated for total sleep time does not reflect OSAS severity during REM sleep, which on average can be twice as high. Mild OSAS in patients with PWS demonstrated by polygraphy without sleep staging may correspond to a moderately-to-severely increased OAHIrem. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Salivary cortisol levels and biological rhythms could be hypothesized as part of the multifactorial framework that explains bruxism etiology. The objective of this study was to examine salivary cortisol levels and biological rhythms in schoolchildren with sleep bruxism (SB).
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with a school-based sample. The Biological Rhythms Interview for Assessment in Neuropsychiatry for Kids (BRIAN-K) was used to evaluate biological rhythms. Salivary samples were collected by the spitting method. The salivary cortisol level was measured by electrochemiluminescence. The criteria proposed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) were used to evaluate SB.
   Results: The SB prevalence was 16%. The SB presence was associated with belonging to families of lower economic status (p = 0.003). In addition, children with SB showed greater difficulty in maintaining biological rhythm (p = 0.002) and had higher levels of salivary cortisol (p = 0.034) compared with children without SB.
   Conclusions: Higher levels of cortisol and disruption of biological rhythm was associated with SB in schoolchildren. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We evaluated whether insomnia symptoms and short or long sleep duration, alone or in combination, are robustly associated with subsequent trajectory of mental health symptoms.
   Methods: Participants were 2598 individuals (15 to 94 years of age) with elevated mental health symptoms at baseline (2013-14). Associations of baseline insomnia symptoms and sleep duration with two-year trajectory of mental health were estimated and adjusted for multiple potential confounders. Outcomes included recovery (well at both follow-up timepoints), intermittent symptoms (unwell at one follow-up timepoint), and chronic symptoms (unwell at each follow-up timepoint).
   Results: Adjusted for age and sex, baseline insomnia symptoms predicted intermittent (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15-1.80) and chronic (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.77-2.68) trajectories of mental health symptoms. Short sleep duration (<6 h and >= 6 to <7 h) only predicted a chronic trajectory (ORs 1.70-2.06). Associations were attenuated but significant after confounder adjustment. Those who experienced both insomnia and short (<7 h) sleep duration had the greatest risk of chronic mental health symptoms (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.60-3.45).
   Conclusion: A focus on just sleep duration or insomnia symptoms in those with elevated mental health symptoms will not be adequate to address chronicity. Both components of sleep disturbance, and in particular their co-occurrence, should be addressed. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective/background: Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are frequently associated with long-term, self-reported sleep disruption. Objective corroboration of these self-reports is sparse and limited by small sample sizes. The purpose of this study was to report on actigraphically-measured sleep outcomes in individuals with and without a history of recent mTBI in two U.S. cities (Boston, MA and Tucson, AZ).
   Patients/methods: Fifty-eight individuals with a recent (within 18 months) mTBI and 35 individuals with no prior mTBI history were recruited for one of four studies across two sites. Participants completed a minimum of one week of actigraphy. Additionally, mTBI participants self-reported daytime sleepiness, sleep disruption, and functional sleep-related outcomes.
   Results: In Boston, mTBI participants obtained less average sleep with shorter sleep onset latencies (SOL) than healthy individuals. In Tucson, mTBI participants had greater SOL and less night-to-night SOL variability compared to healthy individuals. Across mTBI participants, SOL was shorter and night-to-night SOL variability was greater in Boston than Tucson. Sleep efficiency (SE) variability was greater in Tucson than Boston across both groups. Only SOL variability was significantly associated with daytime sleepiness (r = 0.274) in the mTBI group after controlling for location.
   Conclusion: Sleep quality, SOL and SE variability, are likely affected by mTBIs. Between-group differences in each site existed but went in opposite directions. These findings suggest the possibility of multiple, rather than a singular, profiles of sleep disruption following mTBI. Precision medicine models are warranted to determine whether multiple sleep disruption profiles do indeed exist following mTBI and the predisposing conditions that contribute to an individual's experience of sleep disruption.

AB Background: Noise in the vicinity of airports is a public health issue. Exposure to aircraft noise has been shown to have adverse effects on health and particularly on sleep. Many studies support the hypothesis that noise at night can affect subjective sleep quality. Fewer studies, however, have performed objective measurements of sleep.
   Objectives: This study aimed to investigate by actigraphy the relationship between aircraft noise exposure and objective parameters of sleep quality in the population living near two French airports.
   Methods: This study includes 112 participants living in the vicinity of Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Toulouse-Blagnac airports. Wrist actigraphy measurements were performed during eight nights to evaluate objective parameters of sleep quality such as sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), time in bed (TB) and sleep efficiency (SE). Acoustic measurements were made simultaneously both inside the participants' bedrooms and outside (at the exterior frontage) to estimate aircraft noise levels. Energy indicators related to the sound energetic average for a given period of time, as well as indicators related to noise events (eg, the number of events that exceed a given threshold), were estimated. Logistic and linear regression models were used, taking into account potential confounders: age; gender; marital status; education; and body mass index (BMI).
   Results: Energy indicators, in particular, indicators related to noise events were significantly associated with objective parameters of sleep quality. Increased levels of aircraft noise and increased numbers of aircraft noise events increased the time required for sleep onset (SOL) and the total wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and decreased sleep efficiency (SE). An association was also observed between aircraft noise exposure and an increase in total sleep time (TST) and time in bed (TB).
   Conclusion: The findings of the present study contribute to the overall evidence suggesting that nocturnal aircraft noise exposure may decrease the objective quality of sleep. Aircraft noise exposure affects objective parameters of sleep quality, not only regarding noise levels but also regarding the number of events. Mechanisms for adapting to sleep deprivation could be observed. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The main objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the accuracy of the Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder (SRBD) Scale in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.
   Patients/methods: A literature search of studies comparing SRBD to polysomnography for the diagnosis of OSAS in children was performed. Risks of biases were quantified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. Analyses determined the summary receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (SROC), the pooled sensitivity (Se), the specificity (Sp), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-).
   Results were graded and are expressed as means [95% confidence interval]. Post-test probabilities were computed for various populations. Results: Eleven studies were included; and two were considered to have high risk of bias. The SROC was 0.73 [CI: 0.63; 0.82]. The combined Se, Sp, LR+ and LR- were: 0.72 [CI: 0.68; 0.77], 0.59 [CI: 0.56; 0.63], 1.74 [CI: 1.32; 2.30], 0.53 [CI: 0.39; 0.71], respectively. Sub-group analyses displayed similar results in comparison to overall results. GRADE evidence for the overall analysis was low to moderate. Finally, pretest to post-test probabilities were estimated to be: 3.5%-1%, 50%-30% and 75%-30%, for the general population, the obese patients and the patients assigned for surgical treatment of OSAS, respectively.
   Conclusions: The current meta-analysis indicates that the SRBD scale has acceptable accuracy in detecting patients with OSAS. It may be useful when evaluating patients with suspected OSAS before surgery. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Both guided online and individual face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) are effective in improving insomnia symptoms and sleep efficiency. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms generating this effect. The present study tests the assumption that pre-sleep arousal, sleep-related worry and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep are mediators in the effect of cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia.
   Methods: A secondary analysis was performed on data previously collected from a randomized controlled trial (N = 90). In this trial, participants were randomized to either a face-to-face CBT-I condition, an internet-delivered CBT-I condition, or a wait-list group. This article reports on the efficacy of these interventions on pre-sleep arousal, sleep-related worry, and dysfunctional beliefs. Furthermore, we investigated whether these measures mediated the treatment effect on insomnia severity and sleep efficiency.
   Results: Both treatment modalities were efficacious for these cognitive measures; however, face-to-face treatment showed superiority over the online treatment. All three cognitive measures mediated the effect on insomnia severity. Sleep-related worry and pre-sleep arousal mediated the effect on sleep efficiency, but dysfunctional beliefs did not.
   Conclusion: Overall, these results point toward the importance of cognitive processes in the treatment of insomnia, implying that psychological treatments for insomnia may best be guided by (also) targeting these cognitive processes. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: The International Restless Legs Study Group (IRLSSG) has developed the IRLS (International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale) and validated it as a clinician/researcher administered scale to be used when both patient and examiner are present. The IRLSSG recognized the need for a self-completing scale that can be used economically in clinical practice and in large population-based studies. In this study the validity and the reliability of the IRLS as a self-administered scale (sIRLS) is assessed.
   Methods: Established RLS patients were recruited by eight centers in four countries and consented to participate in this study. The validity of the sIRLS was assessed by patients completing the sIRLS before a clinician administered the IRLS. The reliability of the sIRLS was assessed by patients completing the sIRLS again, two weeks after the first one, provided no change had occurred.
   Results: Overall, 173 patients were recruited and 164 of them were included in the analyses. The sIRLS showed satisfactory scaling assumptions and no relevant floor or ceiling effect. One factor explained 61.3% of the variance. Cronbach's alpha was 0.93 and the item homogeneity index was 0.59. Intraclass correlation coefficient between the sIRLS and the IRLS was 0.94. The sIRLS standard error of measurement was 3.61 (1/2 SD at baseline = 4.11). The results mostly overlapped those of the IRLS analyzed in parallel.
   Discussion: The sIRLS is a reliable, valid and precise instrument that showed tight association with the IRLS. These findings support the use of the sIRLS for self-evaluation of RLS severity. The responses obtained on the sIRLS and the IRLS scale varied slightly. Therefore, we recommend that either the sIRLS or the IRLS scale be used as the only scale for serial measures over time.

AB Introduction: Clinical research and studies using animal models have revealed a complex and relatively under-explored interaction between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and alterations in sleep-wake behaviors.
   Objectives: To utilize a structured naturalistic observation-based methodology, consisting of descriptive elements, to provide insight into possible links between altered sleep and disruptive daytime presentations in children and adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). To apply a similar structured behavioral observation protocol in a PAE animal model to compare outcomes from the experimental and clinical studies utilizing naturalistic observational methodology.
   Methods: Forty pediatric patients with FASD (1.8-17.5 yrs, median age 9.4 yrs) and chronic sleep problems were assessed. In the PAE animal model, male offspring from PAE, Pair-Fed (PF), and ad libitum-fed Control (C) groups (n = 8/group) were assessed in the juvenile/preadolescent (23-25 days of age) and adolescent/pubertal (35-36 days of age) periods.
   Results: In the clinical setting, we found that 95% of children with FASD showed disruptive or externalizing behaviors, 73% showed internalizing behaviors, 93% had circadian rhythm sleep disorders, all had chronic insomnia, and 85% had restless sleep, often with tossing/turning/kicking movements indicative of non-restorative sleep with hypermotor events. In the daytime, individuals showed excessive daytime sleepiness as well as hyperactive/hyperkinetic behaviors, an urge-to-move, and involuntary movements suggestive of hyperarousability. Alterations in sleep/wake behaviors in the PAE animal model paralleled the clinical data in many aspects, demonstrating greater sleep latencies, less total time asleep, more total time awake and longer awake bouts, more position changes, more time in transition, and longer transition bouts in PAE compared to PF and/or control animals.
   Conclusions: Thus, our findings provide support for the power and validity of naturalistic observational paradigms in revealing dysregulated sleep-wake behaviors and their association and/or exacerbating relationship with day and nighttime behavioral problems, such as disruptive behaviors, externalizing and internalizing disorders, and daytime sleepiness.

AB Background: This study investigated the protective effect of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia against obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD).
   Methods: In this caseecontrol study, patients with idiopathic RBD and OSA (RBD-OSA) were consecutively enrolled and OSA controls without RBD were matched for age, sex, and apneaehypopnea index (AHI). Clinical and polysomnographic characteristics were compared between RBD-OSA patients and OSA controls. Additionally, differences in AHIs depending on sleep state and posture were analyzed.
   Results: In total, 109 OSA patients (81 males and 28 females) with idiopathic RBD were included in the study. In OSA controls without RBD, AHI and respiratory distress index (RDI) were significantly higher during REM sleep than during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (p < 0.01). In RBD-OSA patients, however, AHI and RDI were slightly lower during REM sleep than during NREM sleep (p < 0.05). During REM sleep, AHI and RDI were significantly lower in RBD-OSA patients than in OSA controls (p < 0.001). Differences in apnea severity between RBD-OSA patients and OSA controls increased in supine REM sleep but disappeared or lessened in non-supine REM sleep. The prevalence of REM-related OSA was lower in RBD-OSA patients (9.2%) than in OSA controls (33.0%).
   Conclusions: REM sleep without atonia has protective effects against OSA in patients with idiopathic RBD. These protective effects are much more potent in supine sleep than in non-supine sleep. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the associations between pre-awake light (PAL) exposure and subjective and objective measures of sleep quality.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study of 1108 elderly participants (mean age, 71.9 years), we measured bedroom light intensity using a bedside light meter for two nights and sleep quality using actigraphy and a questionnaire. PAL was determined as the 2h-average light intensity before rise time, and sleep disturbance was defined as the Pittsburgh sleep quality index score >= 6.
   Results: Sleep disturbance prevalence increased with increased PAL exposure (P = 0.002). In multivariable models adjusted for potential confounders, the odds ratio (OR) for sleep disturbances was significantly higher in the highest quartile PAL group (Q4) than in the lowest quartile group (Q1) (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16-2.34). This association occurred independent of post-bedtime light exposure; and was stronger in the later chronotype group (n = 556) (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.05-3.09) than in the earlier chronotype group (n = 552) (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01-2.64). Actigraphic sleep efficiency in the Q4 group was significantly lower by 2.6% (95% CI, 1.3-3.8) than that in the Q1 group. Moreover, longer wake after sleep onset by 7.5 min (95% CI, 2.8-12.2) and sleep onset latency by 0.2 log min (95% CI, 0.1-0.4) were observed in the Q4 group than the Q1 group.
   Conclusions: Higher PAL exposure was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances, independent of post-bedtime light exposure. Consistent results were observed in the actigraphy analysis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The relationship between insomnia and objectively measured obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity has not previously been investigated in both genders in the general population. The main aim of this population-based polysomnography (PSG) study was to evaluate the cross-sectional association between severity of OSA and DSM-V insomnia and insomnia severity.
   Methods: A random sample of 1200 participants in the third Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT3) was invited and 213 (18%) aged between 21 and 82 years underwent an ambulatory PSG, a semi-structured interview, and a sleep-specific questionnaire. A proxy DSM-V insomnia diagnosis as well as an Insomnia Symptom Score (ISS, range 0-12) were calculated from three insomnia questions and one daytime sleepiness symptom question. Participants were then divided into three groups according to their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): AHI < 5 (without OSA), AHI 5-14.9 (mild OSA), and AHI >= 15 (moderate-to-severe OSA). Associations between prevalence of insomnia and OSA groups were assessed by logistic regression models adjusted for age and gender. Associations between ISS and OSA were assessed in a general linear model with contrasts.
   Results: A total of 25.2% (29.1% women, 12.5% men) had insomnia. Insomnia prevalence did not differ between subjects with and without OSA, but ISS differed significantly between OSA categories (ANCOVA df 2, F = 6.73, p = 0.001). ISS was lower in the moderate-to-severe OSA-group compared to those without OSA (mean difference -2.68; 95% [CI -4.33, -1.04]; p = 0.002). In subjects with moderate-to-severe OSA, ISS correlated negatively with age (Pearson r = -0.66, p = 0.015).
   Conclusion: In this population-based PSG study, no overall statistical association between OSA and insomnia prevalence was found. However, participants with moderate-to-severe OSA reported less insomnia symptoms than subjects without OSA, in particular in older individuals. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To estimate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and identify related factors by gender in the Chinese rural population.
   Methods: Overall, 27424 subjects (10881 males and 16543 females) aged 18-79 years were enrolled from the Henan Rural Cohort Study. Sleep quality was evaluated by the standard Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and global score>5 was classified as poor sleep quality. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A meta-analysis including 14 studies was used to validate the result of the cross-sectional study.
   Results: The average PSQI score was 3.78 +/- 2.72 in total, and the score of females (4.10 +/- 2.90) was significantly higher than males (3.29 +/- 2.33). The crude and age-standardized prevalences of poor sleep quality were 21.62% and 15.80%, respectively. The crude prevalence in females (25.73%) was significantly higher than males (15.38%). The results of meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of poor sleep quality was 25.0% (18.8%-31.2%) in total sample, 31.7% (24.9%-38.5%) in male, and 38.2% (29.7%-46.7%) in females. Multivariate logistic regression identified that older age, being female, unmarried/divorced/widowed, low education level, low income, drinking, depression and dyslipidemia could increase the odds of poor sleep quality.
   Conclusions: More than one fifth of the participants in a rural area of China slept poorly and the prevalence in females was significantly higher than males. Effective interventions are urgently needed to improve the sleep quality in resource limited areas. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI REM theta activity predicts re-experiencing symptoms after exposure to a

   STIMULI; EVENT SCALE; PTSD; DISTURBANCES
AB Background: Extensive empirical evidence indicates that sleep plays an active role in memory consolidation. Moreover, sleep has been found to preferentially enhance emotional memories and may modulate affective reactions to previously encountered stimuli. Notably, recent findings suggest that disruptions of sleep-related memory processing could be involved in posttraumatic symptom development such that sleep disturbances may accelerate symptoms of intrusive re-experiencing.
   Methods: Based on this emerging evidence, we investigated whether an analogue traumatic event would result in immediate impairments of sleep quality in a group of healthy, robust sleepers. In addition, we examined associations between a specific oscillatory correlate of emotional memory consolidation processes (REM theta activity) and subsequent analogue PTSD symptoms. Thirty-three healthy participants entered the study and were exposed to either "traumatic" or neutral films. Thereafter, participants were subjected to an 8.5-hour-long nocturnal sleep opportunity under standardized laboratory conditions including full-night polysomnographic recordings. Ambulatory intrusive memories and subjective symptom ratings were assessed during a period of three consecutive days.
   Results and conclusions: Our results provide partial support for impaired sleep quality after exposure to a traumatic film. Correlation analyses further reveal that a longer REM sleep duration after "traumatic" exposure predicts reduced analogue PTSD symptoms. Critically, REM theta activity selectively predicts lower re-experiencing symptoms. As previous findings suggest that REM theta activity is reduced in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder, our findings provide a new perspective on the functional role of REM sleep in trauma memory processing.

AB Objectives: Sleep has been closely linked to breast cancer risk. However, the association between sleep and breast cancer prognosis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the separate and joint effects of multiple sleep characteristics on breast cancer prognosis among Chinese women.
   Methods: A total of 1580 breast cancer patients were recruited between October 2008 and December 2014 and followed up until December 31, 2017 in Guangzhou. Multivariate Cox models were conducted to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for breast cancer prognosis in association with sleep characteristics.
   Results: Long sleep duration at night (>9 h) (HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.01-5.42), poor sleep quality (HR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.74-5.47), and impaired daytime function (HR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.65-3.79) after diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer progression. Both short sleep duration (<6 h) (HR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.06-3.77, P-interaction = 0.011) and long sleep duration (>9 h) (HR = 4.69, 95% CI: 1.31 -16.78, P-interaction = 0.187) increased the progression risk only among patients with impaired but not normal daytime function. In addition, daytime napping significantly modified the effect of short sleep duration on the progression (HR = 3.55, 0.59, 95% CI: 1.55-7.97, 0.23-1.53 for patients without and with daytime napping, respectively, P-interaction = 0.005). Stratification results suggested that the associations were more evident among pre-menopausal patients, although no significant interaction was observed.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggested that inadequate sleep duration to feel one's best and poor sleep quality after diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer progression, particularly for pre-menopausal women. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI P-wave dispersion as a simple tool for screening childhood obstructive

ID DURATION; MARKER
AB Introduction: The gold standard for the diagnosis of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) diagnosis is polysomnography; however, electrocardiography (ECG) may provide a simpler alternative. P-wave dispersion (PWD), the difference between the maximum and minimum P-wave duration measured by 12-lead ECG, is increased in adult OSAS but has not been researched in childhood OSAS. The aims of this study were to determine the PWD and cut-off value for the diagnosis of childhood OSAS and its association with severity.
   Methods: A total of 77 children with confirmed OSAS and 44 control participants underwent surface 12-lead ECG. P-wave duration was measured using a digital caliper by a researcher blinded to the groups.
   Results: Median (interquartile range) PWD in children with OSAS (median age = 82.8 months, range = 24-194 months) was significantly higher than that in the control group (median age = 73.4 months, range = 12-156 months): 38.3 (29.7-50.5) vs 25.5 (20.5-30.5) milliseconds, respectively (p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis according to OSAS severity categorized by the apnea-hypopnea index from polysomnography demonstrated that PWD in the severe OSAS group (n = 24) was significantly higher than that in the mild-to-moderate OSAS group (n = 53): 48.5 (34.7-67.4) vs 35.5 (28.2-47.8) milliseconds, respectively (p = 0.006). A cut-off value of PWD at 26.5 ms from the receiver operating characteristic curve for the diagnosis showed the area under the curve to be 0.839, with a sensitivity of 89.6% and a specificity of 61.4%.
   Conclusion: PWD was significantly increased in children with OSAS, particularly in severe cases. PWD could be a useful tool for screening childhood OSAS. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Diagnosed autism spectrum disorders have been associated with a high prevalence of sleep problems, other psychiatric disorders and social deficits in adolescence. However, little is known about the possible connection between subclinical autistic traits and sleep. This study explored whether adolescents with elevated levels of subclinical autistic traits are at heightened risk for sleep problems.
   Methods: This study used data from the community cohort born in 1998. The sample consisted of 157 (57% girls) 17-year-old adolescents. Autistic traits were assessed using the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale were utilized to control for comorbid psychiatric symptoms. Sleep was measured with actigraphy and sleep quality was self-rated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Associations between autistic traits and sleep were examined using logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Elevated levels of autistic traits were significantly associated with shorter weekday sleep duration. Moreover, autistic traits remained an independent predictor of short sleep duration when comorbid psychiatric symptoms were controlled for (OR 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03-1.26).
   Conclusions: The results suggest that subclinical autistic traits should be considered as a possible underlying mechanism affecting adolescent sleep. (c) 2018 The Authors.

AB Introduction: Insufficient sleep increases pain sensitivity in healthy individuals. Additionally, extending sleep (eg, increasing nocturnal sleep time or adding a mid-day nap) has been shown to restore pain sensitivity to baseline levels in sleep deprived/restricted individuals. Whether sleep extension can reduce pain sensitivity beyond baseline levels in non-sleep restricted/deprived individuals remains unknown.
   Methods: In a sample of 27 healthy, pain-free, normally-sleeping individuals (17 males, mean age similar to 24 yrs), we examined the impact of five nights of sleep extension on pain sensitivity. Pain threshold (elapsed time until the participant reported pain) and pain tolerance (total time the participant kept the hand submerged in the cold water) were measured using the Cold Pressor Task. Furthermore, we assessed the extent to which self-reported sleep amount in relation to the minimal subjective sleep requirement for adequate performance (sleep credit) was associated with pain sensitivity changes.
   Results: On average individuals slept almost 2 extra hours per night. Our results indicate that sleep extension increases pain tolerance beyond baseline levels. However, sleep extension did not impact pain threshold. We also found that individuals with a smaller sleep credit (ie, those who habitually obtain less sleep than they feel they need) experienced greater increases in pain tolerance after extending sleep.
   Conclusions: The present findings suggest that sleep extension may increase pain tolerance but not pain threshold in healthy individuals who normally sleep the recommended amount. Our findings also support the idea that sleep credit may be a strong indicator of sleep debt in the context of pain sensitivity. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can influence the appearance and proliferation of some tumors. The Sleep Apnea In Lung Cancer Screening (SAILS) study (NCT02764866) evaluated the prevalence of OSA and nocturnal hypoxemia in a high-risk population enrolled in a lung cancer screening program.
   Methods: This was a prospective study of the prevalence of OSA in a lung cancer screening program. Subjects met the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) age and smoking criteria (age 55-75 years; pack-years >30). Participants in the study were offered annual screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and pulmonary function testing, as well as home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) and a sleep-specific questionnaire. Sleep study - related variables, symptoms, and epidemiologic data were recorded.
   Results: HSAT was offered to 279 subjects enrolled in our lung cancer screening program. HSAT results were available for 236 participants (mean age 63.6 years; mean tobacco exposure: 45 pack-years), of whom 59% were male and 53% were active smokers. Emphysema (74%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (62%) were common and in most cases mild in severity. OSA, including moderate to severe disease, was very common in this patient population. AHI distributions were as follows: AHI <5 (22.5%); 5-15 (36.4%); 15-30 (23.3%); and >30 (17.8%). Nocturnal hypoxemia (T90) (p = 0.003), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (p = 0.01), tobacco exposure (p = 0.024), and COPD (p = 0.023) were associated with OSA severity. Positive screening findings (nodules >= 6 mm) were associated with nocturnal hypoxemia on multivariate analysis adjusted for confounders (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.12-6.09, p = 0.027).
   Conclusion: Moderate to severe OSA is very prevalent in patients enrolled in a lung cancer screening program. Nocturnal hypoxemia more than doubles the risk of positive screening findings. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To survey potential predictors of success of mandibular advancement device (MAD) therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and in particular, to examine anatomical narrowings and sleep-related collapse levels in the upper airway.
   Methods: This was a prospective study of 62 OSA patients (median apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] of 34), who were treated with a custom-made, monobloc MAD. The upper airway was examined by inspection, nasopharyngoscopy, overnight acoustic reflectometry recording collapses, and cephalometry of soft tissue dimensions (in addition to skeletal parameters). MAD treatment was controlled by polysomnograpy before and after at least five weeks from the beginning of treatment. Independent predictors of actual reduction in AHI and treatment success (reduction in AHI >= 50% with residual AHI < 10) were determined, using multivariable linear and logistic regression.
   Results: Positional OSA (POSA) and nonsupine AHI (adjusted for upper airway narrowness and collapses, together with gender, age, body mass index, neck circumference, and baseline AHI) were the only independent predictors: POSA indicative for success, and nonsupine AHI inversely related to success. Cephalometry was not predictive. Two predictive models were proposed, one based on POSA having a specificity of 70% and sensitivity of 69%, and the other based on nonsupine AHI, generating a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (area under ROC = 0.78). Using the ROC model, specificity could be increased to 80% without lowering sensitivity.
   Conclusions: Only variables related to sleep position proved to be independent predictors of success with MAD therapy. The results could be explained by the MAD counteracting the mandible from moving backwards when sleeping supine. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   MORPHOLOGY
AB Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disease with high prevalence, which reportedly influences our eyes, brain, cardiovascular system and endocrine metabolism system. Much of these symptoms are thought to be associated with damage to the brain. However, the basic neural pathophysiologic mechanism underlying these deficits is unclear. In this study, we investigate the specific and common neurostructural/functional abnormalities in OSA patients comparing with healthy people by conducting separate and multimodal meta-analysis of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.
   Method: We search data from the original studies, extract height, coordinates of the peaks of the reported volumetric abnormalities, and recreate a map of the effect sizes of the differences between patients and controls. We use the anisotropic effect-size version of Signed Differential Mapping (AES-SDM) to clarify the robust regions in our brain when suffering from OSA.
   Result: We find shared changes in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC), which showed both decreased gray matter volume (GMV) and functional response in OSA patients; as well as GMV of the bilateral anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyri (ACC/ApCC) and hippocampus/parahippocompalgyrus (Hippo/PHG), the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and Left cerebellum VI decrease. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) exhibited hypoactivation relative to controls, whereas the insula showed hyperactivation.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated the significant alterations of brain structural and functional response in OSA patients. These changes give us a description about underlying neural alterations in OSA patients and may explain the psychic disorders, memory deficits, cardiovascular abnormalities and endocrine metabolism system problems, suggesting the early diagnose and treatment.

AB Background: Diabetes-associated Kidney Disease (DKD) is a common comorbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes. The present study investigates whether daytime sleeping duration in patients, ill with type 2 diabetes, is associated with DKD.
   Methods: A total of 733 outpatients of the cross-sectional baseline survey of the DIACORE study were analyzed with respect to their self-reported daytime sleeping duration, assessed by a standardized questionnaire. DKD was defined as eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and/or urinary albumin-to-creatinine-ratio (UACR) > 30 mg/g.
   Results: Mean daytime sleeping duration was 17 +/- 27 min. With increasing daytime sleeping duration a statistically significant decrease in eGFR (p = 0.002) and increase in UACR (p < 0.001) were found, respectively. Prevalence of DKD was significantly higher in patients with longer daytime sleeping duration (31% in patients not napping, 40% in patients napping less than 30 min, 47% in patients napping 30-60 min, 56% in patients napping 60 min or more; p = 0.001). After accounting for known modulators (Age, sex, BMI, waist-hip-ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, physical activity, diabetes duration, HbA1c, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-Index), nighttime sleeping duration, apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)), longer daytime sleeping duration was significantly associated with impaired eGFR [B (95% CI) = -0.05 (-0.09; 0.00), p = 0.044] and increased UACR [B (95% CI) = 0.01 (0.01; 0.02), p < 0.001], respectively.
   Conclusion: Increased daytime sleeping duration is significantly associated with reduced eGFR and higher UACR, independent of known modulators of DKD. The direction of this relationship remains unclear. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate, in Canadian children with cerebral palsy (CP): (1) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as well as (2) associations between HRQoL and (a) sleep problems, (b) nighttime pain, and (c) child characteristics (eg, age, CP phenotype, comorbidities).
   Methods: Children aged 3-12 years were recruited from neurology clinics and a provincial CP registry. Caregivers completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core and CP Modules as well as the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) to assess HRQoL and sleep, respectively. Child characteristics were extracted from hospital records and registry data.
   Results: A total of 146 children with CP (mean age +/- standard deviation: 6.9 +/- 2.9 years) completed the study. Impaired HRQoL (scores more than 2 SDs below the normative population mean) on the PedsQL Total, Physical and Psychosocial Health scales was found in 33.6%, 38.4% and 17.6% of children, respectively. Non-ambulatory status, sleep problems and significant comorbidity were the strongest predictors of impaired Total HRQoL, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 30.1 (8.2-110.4), 3.8 (1.1-12.5) and 3.3 (1.2-9.2), respectively, adjusted for young age (5-7 years) and nighttime pain. Non-ambulatory status and sleep problems exclusively increased the risk of impaired physical and psychological health, respectively, with adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of 58.3 (11.9-284.5) and 7.5 (2.5-22.5). More severe sleep problems were associated with worse pain-related HRQoL.
   Conclusions: Sleep, non-ambulatory status and presence of comorbidities are important determinants of HRQoL in children with CP. Monitoring sleep, psychosocial functioning and pain is important in this population, as their management should improve HRQoL. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Chronotype is a construct contributing to individual differences in sleep-wake timing. Previous studies with children have found that evening-types exhibit greater sleep difficulties. Infant sleep quality can be modulated by several factors, such as parental characteristics. We examined the association between parental circadian preference and sleep in early childhood.
   Methods: This study was based on a longitudinal birth cohort, with several measurement points. We used information regarding parental questionnaires during pregnancy and children's sleep measures at three, eight, 18 and 24 months. In total, 1220 mothers, 1116 fathers, 993 infants at three months, 990 infants at eight months, 958 children at 18 months, and 777 children at 24 months were analyzed. Parental circadian preference was measured using the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Concerning children's sleep, we used the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and the Infant Sleep Questionnaire (ISQ) at each time point.
   Results: Maternal circadian preference was associated with infants' circadian rhythm development at three, eight, 18 and 24 months. Furthermore, increased maternal eveningness was also related to short sleep during daytime at three months, and nighttime at three and eight months, to long sleep-onset latency at three, 18 and 24 months, to late bedtime at three, eight and 18 months, and to sleep difficulties at eight and 24 months. Paternal circadian preference was not associated with any sleep variable at any time point.
   Conclusion: Maternal circadian preference is related to several sleep difficulties in early childhood, and it may be considered a potential risk factor for the onset of early sleeping problems. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To assess sleep duration-mortality relationships across a 27-year follow-up period in a well characterized random sample of older people, and to test the hypothesis that mortality risks associated with long sleep duration confound with, and can be explained by, low levels of functional capacity indicative of frailty.
   Methods: Face-to-face interviews conducted among 1002 randomly sampled older (65+) people in 1985 provided baseline profiles of health, functional capacity, physical activity, and sleep quality and duration. Health and functional status in each of 6 sleep duration categories (<= 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, >= 9 h) was examined. At censorship in 2012, 927 deaths were recorded. Relationships between sleep duration and 27-year all-cause mortality were then examined in a series of incrementally adjusted Cox regression models.
   Results: Associations between sleep duration and measures of sleep quality were predominantly linear, with longer sleep times indicating superior sleep quality. Relationships between sleep duration and functional capacity, on the other hand, were predominantly quadratic, with most approximating a U-shaped function. Adjusted for age, gender, social class, insomnia symptoms, physical health, depression, BMI and smoking status, long sleep duration and continuous hypnotic drug use at baseline were significantly and independently associated with elevated mortality risk (HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.05-1.78; HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.01-1.51). When indices of frailty were added to the model, hazard ratios for long sleep duration and hypnotic drug became non-significant, while the lowest physical activity quintile and very slow walking speed significantly increased mortality risk (HR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.40-2.30; HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.15-1.73 respectively).
   Conclusions: In analyses of sleep-related mortality outcomes long sleep durations confound with, and may be indicative of, incipient frailty among older participants. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To examine prescribing of drugs treating or exacerbating restless legs syndrome (RLS) during U.S. physician office visits for RLS for the years 2007-2015; and to assess potential prescribing predictors of these drugs.
   Methods: Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. We calculated weighted percentages of RLS-related office visits associated with RLS treatment drugs (alpha-2-delta ligands, dopamine agonists, and other drugs used for RLS) and exacerbating drugs. Using logistic regression, we examined the adjusted association between potential predictors and prescribing of major RLS treatment (dopamine agonists and alpha-2-delta ligands) and exacerbating drugs.
   Results: A total of 456 RLS-related office visits were included for analysis, representing approximately 9.9 million visits. The weighted percentages of visits with dopamine agonists (excluding levodopa) decreased from 50% to 22% (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.26, 0.77). A visit to a neurologist was associated with a 76% increase in prescribing of the major RLS treatment drugs compared with a visit to a family/general or internal medicine physician (RR 1.76; 95% CI 1.29, 2.42). RLS exacerbating drugs were listed in 28% (95% CI 21-36) of RLS-related visits, mostly for antidepressants (83%). Younger age groups (18-44 and 45-64) were predictors of RLS exacerbating drug prescribing, compared with the older age group (RR 2.46; RR 2.00, respectively).
   Conclusion: Prescribing of dopamine agonists during RLS-related visits decreased during 2007-2015, but prescribing of RLS exacerbating drugs remained high. More investigation is necessary concerning whether clinicians assess the appropriateness of RLS exacerbating drugs for RLS patients before newly prescribing or continuing those drugs. Also, future research would need to investigate what factors contribute to the difference in the RLS treatment prescribing patterns between neurologists and family/ general or internal medicine physicians.

AB Objective: Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) is associated with negative outcomes, including reduced daytime performance and difficulties with treatment adherence. These outcomes are mediated by executive functions (EF). In this study, we investigated whether patients with DSWPD report inferior EF compared to a control group. The study consisted of 40 patients diagnosed with DSWPD (12 males, mean age 20.7 (+/- 3.1)) and 20 healthy controls (six males, 21.3 (+/- 2.2), p = 1.00) between 16 and 25 years (p = 0.42).
   Methods: Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult version Self-Report (BRIEF-A) was used for adults >= 18 years (DSWPD n = 28; controls n = 17) whereas Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function Self-Report Version (BRIEF-SR) was used for assessment of EF in adolescents <18 years (DSWPD n = 12; controls n = 3). Independent samples t-tests were used to compare patients to controls.
   Results: The total group of patients with DSWPD scored significantly poorer compared to the control group on the main indexes; Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) (p = < 0.0005), Metacognition Index (MI) (p = < 0.0005), and Global Executive Composite (GEC) (p = < 0.0005). The adult group with DSWPD scored significantly poorer than the adult control group on eleven of the twelve BRIEF-A scales. Among patients < 18 years, the DSWPD-group scored significantly poorer than the control group on 8 of the 13 BRIEF-SR-scales.
   Conclusion: Patients with DSWPD reported significantly poorer EF compared to controls. Assessment of EF in patients with DSWPD can be valuable for understanding the consequences of the disorder regarding treatment tailoring and adherence. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objectives: (1) To determine the prevalence of snoring, breathing pauses during sleep and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in the United Kingdom (UK) and determine the relation between these events and obesity and other sociodemographic variables. (2) To compare and integrate this data with published UK population data.
   Methods: A total of 664 women and 575 men aged 18-100 years who formed a representative sample of the non-institutionalised UK population participated in an online interview survey directed by a previously validated computerised system.
   Results: Overall, 38% of men and 30.4% of women report that they snore at night. Furthermore, 8.7% of men and 5.6% of women state that they stop breathing at night. Comparing our data to published data from the 1990s, this study observes a highly significant increase in the rates of reported breathing pauses during sleep (sleep apnoea) in the UK over the last 20 years (p < 0.0001). In addition, we observe a highly significant increase in the prevalence of obesity (BMI > 30) in the UK population between 1994 and 2015 (p < 0.0001). Integration of our data with NHS and public health England data on obesity confirms this increase.
   Conclusions: Our data demonstrate a significant increase in the rates of reported breathing pauses during sleep (sleep apnoea) and obesity in the UK over the last 20 years. Sociodemographic and behavioural changes have likely contributed to this. Moreover, our data also suggests that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is widely underdiagnosed in the UK.

AB Objective/background: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is frequent in Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) infants. Prone positioning (PP) is commonly recommended but has never been studied by polysomnography (PSG). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the PP on sleep and breathing outcomes measured by PSG.
   Patients/methods: Retrospective study conducted between 2015 and 2017 in a tertiary hospital. A PSG with pulse oximetry and transcutaneous carbon dioxide was performed in PRS infants in the supine position (SP) and the PP. Sleep and breathing outcome measures were compared between SP and PP.
   Results: Among the 18 PRS (mean +/- SD age: 44 +/- 26 days at evaluation), 11 had clinical manifestations of OSA. All had severe OSA diagnosed on PSG. In the PP, infants had a significantly higher sleep efficiency (median [IQR]: 83% [69-90]) than in the SP (70% [55-77], p = 0.04). During REM, there was a trend towards lower OAHI in the PP (50/h [28-82] versus 61/h [40-103], p = 0.05). For 13, the PP was the best sleep position (72%), and for four the SP was the best sleep position (22%; p < 0.01). The PP was sufficient alone to decrease OSA index <10 events/hour in three infants.
   Conclusion: Positioning infants in the PP led to an improvement of sleep quality and an incomplete correction of OSAS in the vast majority of PRS infants. A nocturnal sleep recording seems to be indicated systematically in the early evaluation of these young patients to choose the best therapeutic option for OSAS.

AB Vitamin D is a pro-hormone belonging to the category of the fat-soluble group of vitamins; it is obtained more from solar exposure and in smaller quantities through feeding. Although vitamin D has traditionally been shown to be involved in calcium homeostasis and bone health, recent studies have found a positive association between vitamin D and sleep. In particular, clinical studies in humans indicate that low levels of vitamin D are correlated with poor quality and short sleep duration. The mechanism by which this association is explained is still unclear. However, vitamin D receptors have been found in the brain regions involved in sleep regulation, and vitamin D appears to be involved in regulating the sleep ewake cycle. The current review summarizes the available evidence regarding the association between vitamin D and sleep, focusing on both clinical and preclinical studies. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study we re-evaluated the PST profiles of five cyanobacterial cultures (Dolichospermum circinale AWQC131C, Aphanizomenon sp. NH-5, Raphidiopsis raciborskii T3, Scytonema cf. crispum CAWBG524 and CAWBG72) and one environmental sample (Microseria wollei) using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 35 different PST variants were detected. D. circinale contained the highest number of variants (23), followed by S. cf. crispum CAWBG72 (21). Many of the variants detected in the cultures/environmental sample had not been reported from these strains previously: D. circinale (14 variants), S. cf. crispum CAWBG72 (16), S. cf. crispum CAWBG524 (9), Aphanizomenon sp. (9), R. raciborskii (7), and M. wollei (7). Of particular interest was the detection of M-toxins (Aphanizomenon sp., R. raciborskii, D. circinale). These have previously only been identified from shellfish where they were thought to be metabolites. Well-characterized PST variant profiles are essential for research investigating the genetic basis of PST production, and given that the toxicity of each variants differs, it will assist in refining risk assessments.

AB Purpose: We previously reported the efficacy of intraarticular (IA) rimabotulinumtoxinB (BoNT/B) in a murine model of chronic degenerative arthritis pain. This study aimed to measure the analgesic effects of onabotulinumtoxinA (BoNT/A) on collagenase induced chronic degenerative arthritis joint pain.
   Methods: Chronic degenerative arthritis was produced by IA injection of 10 I collagenase (Col) (10 IU) into the left knee of C57BL/6J female mice 4 weeks prior to pain assessment. IA BoNT/A was injected 3 days before testing. Arthritis pain was measured as evoked pain scores (EPS) and spontaneous pain behaviors with an advanced dynamic weight bearing (ADWB) device. EPS was a tally of fights and vocalizations exhibited in one minute with knee palpation. Percent body weight and percent time spent on each limb was quantified. All mice were 12 weeks old at the time of examination.
   Results: IA Col increased EPS and reduced ADWB measures of percent weight bearing on the left hind limb compared to naive mice. BoNT/A treatment reduced EPS and increased weight bearing on the left hind limb. The improvements were not significant compared to the Col group. There was no significant difference in time spent on the left hind limb between any treatment groups. Forelimb ADWB measures of percent weight and time in arthritic mice significantly increased compared to nonarthritic animals. Treatment with BoNT/A in the arthritic limb decreased this offloading; however, statistical analysis only showed significance in weightbearing.
   Conclusion: IA Col monoarthritis increased evoked and spontaneous pain behaviors in female mice after four weeks. Treatment with IA BoNT/A decreased pain behaviors but only forelimb weight bearing showed a significant improvement. This led us to conclude that treatment with BoNT/A is not an effective analgesic for the treatment of chronic degenerative knee arthritis in murine models.

AB The isolation and characterization of individual snake venom components is important for a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of envenomations, for improving the therapeutic procedures of patients, and it also opens possibilities for the discovery of novel toxins that might be useful as tools for understanding cellular and molecular processes. This review provides a summary of the different toxins that have been isolated and characterized from the venoms of Vipera lebetina (Macrovipera lebetina) subspecies Macrovipera lebetina cernovi, Macrovipera lebetina lebetina, Macrovipera lebetina obtusa, Macrovipera lebetina transmediterranea, Macrovipera lebetina turanica, the snake species causing the majority of human envenomings in Central Asia (Middle East) and North Africa. The venoms of these snakes contain proteins belonging to different families: Zn2+- metalloproteinases, serine proteinases, L-amino acid oxidase, 5'-nucleotidase, phosphodiesterase, phosphomonoesterase, nucleases, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A2, C-type lectin-like protein, disintegrin, DC-fragment, cystein-rich secretory protein, proteinase inhibitors, nerve growth factor (NGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), low molecular weight peptides. Their main biochemical properties, toxic and pharmacological actions have been described. In this review we will provide an overview of the proteins and peptides from the venoms of M. lebetina subspecies, their biochemical, pharmacological and structural features and their role in snake venom toxinology. A lot of contributions have been made for better understandings of these venomous snakes, their venom, and their pharmacological effects. Many of these components are also fascinating models for drug design.

DT Editorial Material
ID VENOM COMPONENTS; SPIDER VENOMS; SCORPION; EVOLUTION; WEB
AB The millions of extant arthropod species are testament to their evolutionary success that can at least partially be attributed to venom usage, which evolved independently in at least 19 arthropod lineages. While some arthropods primarily use venom for predation (e.g., spiders and centipedes) or defense (e.g., bees and caterpillars), it can also have more specialised functions (e.g. in parasitoid wasps to paralyse arthropods for their brood to feed on) or even a combination of functions (e.g. the scorpion Parabuthus transvaalicus can deliver a prevenom for predator deterrence and a venom for predation). Most arthropod venoms are complex cocktails of water, salts, small bioactive molecules, peptides, enzymes and larger proteins, with peptides usually comprising the majority of toxins. Some spider venoms have been reported to contain > 1000 peptide toxins, which function as combinatorial libraries to provide an evolutionary advantage. The astounding diversity of venomous arthropods multiplied by their enormous toxin arsenals results in an almost infinite resource for novel bioactive molecules. The main challenge for exploiting this resource is the small size of most arthropods, which can be a limitation for current venom extraction techniques. Fortunately, recent decades have seen an incredible improvement in transcriptomic and proteomic techniques that have provided increasing sensitivity while reducing sample requirements. In turn, this has provided a much larger variety of arthropod venom compounds for potential applications such as therapeutics, molecular probes for basic research, bioinsecticides or anti-parasitic drugs. This special issue of Toxicon aims to cover the breadth of arthropod venom research, including toxin evolution, pharmacology, toxin discovery and characterisation, toxin structures, clinical aspects, and potential applications.

AB Snakebite is an important toxicologic emergency with the potential of triggering local and systemic inflammation. Antivenom has remained the mainstay of treatment for snakebite envenomation. In this study we sought to investigate the effectiveness of Iranian antivenom in a series of 44 viper envenomed patients through analysis of changes in clinical severity and the levels of inflammatory markers. Clinical envenomation severity assessed by snakebite severity score (SSS) and laboratory exams of the patients were recorded before (baseline visit) and after antivenom therapy. During 12-h antivenom therapy, the median (range) score of SSS significantly decreased from 3.5 (2-10) on admission to 1 (0-5) in the last visit (P < 0.001). Moreover, a significant decrease in prothrombin time and international normalized ratio was found (P = 0.006 and 0.008; respectively). Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL) 1-beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), complement hemolytic activity (CH50) were also measured in 10 severely Echis carinatus sochureki envenomed victims and 10 age and gender matched healthy controls. Except IL-8, the baseline levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in victims were significantly higher than healthy controls (P = 0.005, < 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the baseline level of CH50 was significantly lower in the patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). After 12-h antivenom therapy, the plasma levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha significantly decreased (P = 0.032, 0.006 and 0.003, respectively), the levels of IL-8 remained relatively unchanged and the CH50 significantly increased (P = 0.011). Iranian snake antivenom was effective in treating viper bite envenomation as it reversed clinical venom effects and restored near normal underlying inflammatory status. This study is the first to ascertain and report the effectiveness of this antivenom in human subjects.

AB Toxic plants containing monofluoroacetate (MFA) cause sudden death in livestock in Australia, South Africa and Brazil, causing economic losses to producers. The objective of this study was to determine the amount of MFA present in young leaves, mature leaves, senescent leaves, and seeds of Amorimia pubiflora harvested at different times of the year and to determine their toxic effect on sheep. Samples of Amorimia pubiflora were collected during April, August and December of 2015 and March of 2016, separated according to the vegetative stage (young leaves, seeds, mature leaves, and senescent leaves), dried in an oven, and administered in daily doses of 5 g/kg/body weight (bw) of fresh leaves to sheep through ruminal cannulae. The experiment was divided into four stages according to the time of collection of the plant so that each sheep received a different vegetative stage of the plant (young leaves, mature leaves, and senescent leaves). Only in the second stage of the experiment was it possible to collect A. pubifiora seeds, which were administered using the same method used for the administration of the leaves. The sheep were dosed with the plant until they showed clinical signs of toxicosis or until the plant was no longer available. Aliquots of leaves and seeds of A. pubiflora were analyzed for MFA concentration. The seeds and young leaves had higher concentrations of MFA than did the mature (harvested in August and December) and senescent (harvested in December) leaves. However, all vegetative stages of the plant were toxic and caused fatal poisoning. The results of our study showed that A. pubiflora is toxic to sheep even when MFA concentrations are low, demonstrating that the presence of this substance is a risk factor for the occurrence of poisoning. Knowing the toxic principle and its variations allow us to determine the conditions for the occurrence of plant toxicosis as well as possible treatment, control, and prophylaxis methods, contributing significantly to the reduction of economic losses on farms due to plant poisoning.

AB Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a potent cyanobacterial toxin responsible for animal and human poisonings world-wide. MC-LR is found in organisms throughout the foodweb, however there is conjecture regarding whether it biomagnifies. Few studies have investigated how MC-LR interacts with lipid membranes, a determinant of biomagnification potential. We tested whether 1 mu M MC-LR irreversibly associates with lipid bilayers or causes the creation of pore defects upon short and long-term exposure. Using tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs), we observed an increase in membrane conduction in tBLMs, representing an interaction of microcystin-LR with the lipid bilayer and a change in membrane packing properties. However, there were minimal changes in membrane capacitance upon short and long-term exposure, and MC-LR exhibited a rapid off-rate. Upon 24 h exposure to the toxin, no lipophilic multimeric complexes were detected capable of altering the toxin's off-rate. There was no evidence of the creation of new pores. This study demonstrates that MC-LR does not irreversibly imbed itself into lipids membranes after short or long-term exposure and suggests MC-LR does not biomagnify through the food web via lipid storage.

AB Growing broiler chicks on a diet contaminated with aflatoxins (200 or 2000 ppb) for entire growth period resulted in increased oxidative stress and liver damage markers. The toxicity was subsided in broilers received a specific aflatoxin-binding probiotic i.e., Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v). There was a substantial (30-90%) increase in antioxidant activity of plasma, which was suppressed due to dietary aflatoxins. Probiotic also reduced serum lactate dehydrogenase and alanine amino transferase together with lipid peroxidation products in liver, which were elevated due to aflatoxin. Because of Lp299v consumption, there was similar to 20-55% recovery in body weight gain in broilers intoxicated with aflatoxins. Comparison of the Lp299v effects with that of a commercial aflatoxin binder revealed that, improved antioxidant activity of the chicks was associated with growth performance. These data suggest that aflatoxin-binding probiotics are beneficial with multi-functional effects and can efficiently help reducing aflatoxins in food chain associated with poultry industry.

AB Cardiac glycosides (CGs) are secondary compounds found in plants and amphibians and are widely distributed in nature with potential cardiovascular action. Their mechanism is based on the blockage of the heart's sodium potassium ATPase, with a positive inotropic effect. Some of the most well-known CGs are digoxin, ouabain, oleandrin, and bufalin. They have similar chemical structures: a lactone ring, steroid ring, and sugar moiety. Digoxin, ouabain, and oleandrin are classified as cardenolides, consisting of a lactone ring with five carbons, while bufalin is classified as bufodienolides, with a six-carbon ring. Small structural differences determine variations in the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of such substances. Most case reports of poisoning caused by CGs are associated with cardiovascular toxicity, causing a variety of arrhythmias and lesions in the heart tissue. Experimental studies also describe important similarities among different CGs, especially regarding species sensitivity. Recent studies furthermore focus on their antineoplastic potential, with controversial results. Data from research studies and case reports were reviewed to identify the main characteristics of the CGs, including toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics, clinical signs, electrocardiographic, pathological findings, antineoplastic potential and the main techniques used for diagnostic purposes.

AB The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is a widely used model in medical research and fulfils the requirements laid out in the 3 R's. The CAM, contains a dense network of blood vessels, essential for embryo development but also makes the chick embryo an invaluable resource for the study of angiogenesis and the haemotoxicity of substances. Non-neurotoxic snake venom is responsible worldwide for numerous deaths but also has been found to have a vast range of medicinal benefit. This study combines evaluating the time of onset and intensity of effects of three whole viper venoms (Bitis aritans, Crotalus viridis, Agkistrodon contortrix) at varying concentrations. They were applied onto the CAM, using the Luepke grading system as one method of determining their rapid irritation potential. Regarding the principles of 3 R's, this method helps to evaluate the haemotoxic effect of venom as an alternative method to the rodent tests. The information provided from these results can be used as a rapid tool for both medical management of snakebite wounds and the potential use of snake venom in medical treatments. Then, Luepke grading system can help to evaluate the haemotoxic effect of venom in combination with other appropriate methods.

TI Queen venom isosolenopsin A delivers rapid incapacitation of fire ant

SO TOXICON

DT Article

   Paralytic toxin
ID SOLENOPSIS-INVICTA HYMENOPTERA; COLONIES
AB Fire ant venom contains insecticidal alkaloids named 'solenopsins'. Whilst species-specific differences are reported, little attention has been given to caste-specific venom adaptations. The venom of fire ant queens has remained particularly poorly studied, though studies have shown it to be strikingly similar across different species, in being primarily composed of the alkaloid isosolenopsin A, regardless of the chemical configuration in workers. We predict that this is the evolutionary outcome of stabilising selection, implying that a shared mechanism is responsible for the conserved venom composition among fire ant queens. The present investigation tests whether venom plays a role in nest founding, when queens must succeed in isolation in the field against competitor species. Here, we report that fire ant queen venom and isosolenopsin A are faster to incapacitate alien ants than the venom of fire ant workers. Representative sympatric competitor ant species were selected and exposed on their heads to the venom of workers and queens of the invasive fire ant species Solenopsis invicta and S. geminate. Queen venom was found to incapacitate rival foragers quicker than worker venom. The effects were reproduced using synthetic solenopsins, establishing that solenopsin A analogues are particularly effective contact neurotoxins. Overall, the venom of S. invicta is more lethal than of S. geminate, regardless of the incapacitation speed. We believe these are fundamental aspects of the chemical ecology of the invasive ants which remain overlooked, and emphasise the need for further studies into the venom biology of founding queens.

AB Comprising of over a million described species of highly diverse invertebrates, Arthropoda is amongst the most successful animal lineages to have colonized aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic domains. Venom, one of the many fascinating traits to have evolved in various members of this phylum, has underpinned their adaptation to diverse habitats. Over millions of years of evolution, arthropods have evolved ingenious ways of delivering venom in their targets for self-defence and predation. The morphological diversity of venom delivery apparatus in arthropods is astounding, and includes extensively modified pedipalps, tail (telson), mouth parts (hypostome), fangs, appendages (maxillulae), proboscis, ovipositor (stinger), and hair (urticating bristles). Recent investigations have also unravelled an astonishing venom biocomplexity with molecular scaffolds being recruited from a multitude of protein families. Venoms are a remarkable bioresource for discovering lead compounds in targeted therapeutics. Several components with prospective applications in the development of advanced lifesaving drugs and environment friendly bio-insecticides have been discovered from arthropod venoms. Despite these fascinating features, the composition, bioactivity, and molecular evolution of venom in several arthropod lineages remains largely understudied. This review highlights the prevalence of venom, its mode of toxic action, and the evolutionary dynamics of venom in Arthropoda, the most speciose phylum in the animal kingdom.

AB This study aims to investigate the role of Ihh-PTHrP signalling pathway in the articular cartilage injury of rats caused by T-2 toxin. Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: group A, normal diet; group B, normal diet plus the dissolvent (0.9% sodium chloride sterile aqueous solution containing ethanol); group C, normal diet plus low T-2 toxin (0.1 mg/kg BW/day) and group D, normal diet plus high T-2 toxin (0.2 mg/kg BW/day) by intragastric administration daily for 4 weeks. Histological changes in articular cartilage were assessed by HE staining and scanning electron microscopy. The expression of Ihh and PTHrP in cartilage was assessed by immunohistochemistry. There is a significant difference in average weight gain between group A and group D P < 0.01, groups A and D P < 0.001, respectively. The result of scanning electron microscopy and HE staining showed that the damage of articular cartilage was much severe with the increase of T-2 toxin. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the expression of Ihh in group A and group B was higher than that of group C and group D (P < 0.05, < 0.01, respectively). However, the expression of PTHrP was lower in group A and group B than that of group C and group D (P < 0.001, < 0.001, respectively). These results indicated that T-2 toxin can cause the damage to articular cartilage and weight loss in rats. The effect of T-2 toxin on articular cartilage of rat may be related to the Ihh-PTHrP pathway.

AB Spiders have been evolving complex and diverse repertoires of peptides in their venoms with vast pharmacological activities for more than 300 million years. Spiders use their venoms for prey capture and defense, hence they contain peptides that target both prey (mainly arthropods) and predators (other arthropods or vertebrates). This includes peptides that potently and selectively modulate a range of targets such as ion channels, receptors and signaling pathways involved in physiological processes. The contribution of these targets in particular disease pathophysiologies makes spider venoms a valuable source of peptides with potential therapeutic use. In addition, peptides with insecticidal activities, used for prey capture, can be exploited for the development of novel bioinsecticides for agricultural use. Although we have already reviewed potential applications of spider venom peptides as therapeutics (in 2010) and as bioinsecticides (in 2012), a considerable number of research articles on both topics have been published since, warranting an updated review. Here we explore the most recent research on the use of spider venom peptides for both medical and agricultural applications.

AB Trivalent copper complexes are active intermediates in aquatic redox reactions that involve copper ions or structural copper, but their reactivity and selectivity toward pollutants remain unknown. We characterized copper(III) periodate, a representative trivalent copper compound, with phenol and several antibiotics as model contaminants. The results show that Cu(III) is highly reactive to phenol degradation; near-complete degradation was achieved after 10 min at a molar ratio of 3:1 (COM: phenol). Common alcohols, including methanol and 2-propanol, showed pH-dependent reactivity for Cu(III). In contrast to aquo trivalent copper ions that react rapidly with tert-butanol, Cu(Ill) showed limited reactivity toward tert-butanol. A mechanistic investigation showed that the degradation was caused by direct oxidation by Cu(Ill) and that no hydroxyl radicals were involved. Common water components such as chloride ions did not influence the reaction, which suggests that the use of Cu(III) may help mitigate the generation of chlorinated products. As a one-electron oxidant, Cu(III) showed high reactivity to degrade electron-rich compounds; the concentrations of sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfadiazine (100 mu g/L) were reduced to 1.8, 7.5, and 42.5 ng/L, respectively, after 2 min of reaction with 10 mu M Cu(III). These results demonstrate a novel and highly efficient oxidant for selective removal of ubiquitous micropollutants from water bodies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Integrity of freshwater surface-and groundwater ecosystems and their ecological and qualitative status greatly depends on ecological processes taking place in streambed sediments overgrown by biofilm, in the hyporheic zone (HZ). Little is known about the interactions and effects of multiple stressors on biologically driven processes in the HZ. In this study, machine learning (ML) tools were used to provide evidence-based information on how stressors and ecologically important environmental factors interact and drive ecological processes and microbial biomass. The ML technique of decision trees using the J48 algorithm was applied to build models from a data set of 342 samples collected over three seasons at 24 sites within the catchments of five gravel-bed rivers in north-central Slovenia. Catchment-scale land use data and reach-scale environmental features indicating the HZ morphology and physical and chemical characteristics of water were used as predictive variables, while respiration (R) and microbial respiratory electron transport system activity (ETSA) were used as response variables indicating ecological processes and total protein content (TPC) indicating microbial biomass. Separate models were built for two HZ depths: 5-15 cm and 20-40 cm. The models with R as a response variable have the highest predictive performance (67-89%) showing that R is a good indicator of complex environmental gradients. The ETSA and TPC models were less accurate (42-67%) but still provide valuable ecological information. The best model show that temperature when combined with selected water quality elements is an important predictor of R at depth of 5-15 cm. The ETSA and TPC models show the combined effects of temperature, catchment land use and selected water quality elements on both response variables. Overall, this study provides new knowledge on how ecological processes occurring in the HZ respond to catchment and reach-scale variables, and provides evidence-based information about complex interactions between temperature, catchment land use and water quality. These interactions are highly dependent on the selection of the response variable, i.e., each response variable is influenced by a specific combination of predictive environmental variables.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as confirmed but until today underestimated sources of Legionella, playing an important role in local and community cases and outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease. In general, aerobic biological systems provide an optimum environment for the growth of Legionella due to high organic nitrogen and oxygen concentrations, ideal temperatures and the presence of protozoa. However, few studies have investigated the occurrence of Legionella in WWTPs, and many questions in regards to the interacting factors that promote the proliferation and persistence of Legionella in these treatment systems are still unanswered. This critical review summarizes the current knowledge about Legionella in municipal and industrial WWTPs, the conditions that might support their growth, as well as control strategies that have been applied. Furthermore, an overview of current quantification methods, guidelines and health risks associated with Legionella in reclaimed wastewater is also discussed in depth. A better understanding of the conditions promoting the occurrence of Legionella in WWTPs will contribute to the development of improved wastewater treatment technologies and/or innovative mitigation approaches to minimize future Legionella outbreaks.

AB Algae, which are ubiquitous in surface waters (e.g., lakes, ponds, wetlands) may play an important role in sunlight-driven transformation of compounds. This study is to investigate the role of algae (Chlorella Vulgaris) in chlortetracycline (CTC) photolysis and explore the photosensitive mechanism. The algae were found to significantly accelerate the photodegradation rate of CTC and extracellular organic matters (EOMs) were confirmed to be the major active substances. Triplet state EOMs ((EOMs)-E-3*) were verified to be the dominant reactive species with 93% contribution to the indirect photodegradation rate of CTC, while (OH)-O-center dot and O-1(2) contributed minor (7%). The steady-state concentration of (EOMs)-E-3* was determined by probe compounds (2,4,6-trimethylphenol) to be 3.50 x 10(-14) -1.88 x 10(-13) M with the increase of EOMs from 2.0 to 8.0 mg L. The rate constant for reaction of (EOMs)-E-3* with CTC was calculated to be 3.17 x 10(9)M(-1) s(-1). (EOMs)-E-3* were found to react with CTC mainly via electron transfer, on basis of susceptible reaction of (EOMs)-E-3* with the hydroxyl and amidogen groups in CTC. In addition, the energy transfer of (EOMs)-E-3* to CTC was possible according to the higher energy of (EOMs)-E-3* than that of triplet CTC. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon-rich waste materials (solid, liquid, or gaseous) are largely considered to be a burden on society due to the large capital and energy costs for their treatment and disposal. However, solid and liquid organic wastes have inherent energy and value, and similar as waste CO2 gas they can be reused to produce value-added chemicals and materials. There has been a paradigm shift towards developing a closed loop, biorefinery approach for the valorization of these wastes into value-added products, and such an approach enables a more carbon-efficient and circular economy. This review quantitatively analyzes the state-of-the-art of the emerging microbial electrochemical technology (MET) platform and provides critical perspectives on research advancement and technology development. The review offers side-by-side comparison between microbial electrosynthesis (MES) and electro-fermentation (EF) processes in terms of principles, key performance metrics, data analysis, and microorganisms. The study also summarizes all the processes and products that have been developed using MES and EF to date for organic waste and CO2 valorization. It finally identifies the technological and economic potentials and challenges on future system development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Superoxide ion (O-2(center dot-)) is one of the short lived reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed in aquatic environments. The reactions of O-2(center dot-) with the model dissolved organic matter (DOM) were studied using a chemiluminescent analysis method under relevant environmental conditions. The reaction of O-2(center dot-) with DOM produced reduced DOM (DOM center dot-) by fast one-electron-transfer in the initial stage. This process resulted an initial "loss" in the Or decay kinetics. DOM is unstable which will continue react with O-2(center dot-) generating H2O2 to complete a catalytic dismutation cycle. Based on analyzing the observed pseudo-first order O-2(center dot-) decay rates (kpseudo), the quasi-steady-state concentration of DOM is found to be equal to the initial loss of O-2(center dot-). Thus, the rate constant for DOM center dot- with HO2 center dot/O-2(center dot-) is derived to be (1.1 -1.9) x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) in the temperature range of 7.8-41.4 degrees C. Meanwhile, the apparent rate constant for DOM with Or in a flow cell during a short time (2.25 s) is measured as (1.5-3.3) x 10(3) MC-1 S-1 in the temperature range of 8.2-38.6 degrees C. These temperature dependent Or reaction rate constants present an apparent activation energy of (19.6 +/- 2.9) kJ mol(C)(-1) for DOM, while that of DOM center dot- (12.5 +/- 3.5 kJ mol(-1)) is lower. For the pseudo-first order decay rate of Or, the catalyzed-dismutation by metal components ranges from 13 to 23%; the contribution by aromatic ketones of DOM is estimated to be 10-13% by using NaBH4 reduction method. The residual contribution might mainly occur at the quinone-like groups, which contributed 64%-77% to the total dismutation. The pH effects on the apparent catalytic rate constants dominate the reaction of O-2(center dot-) with DOM. The present work suggests that DOM is an important sink for O-2(center dot-) in aquatic environments. Furthermore, we proposed that the reaction of O-2(center dot-) with DOM could be a potential source of DOM center dot- in natural water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Isolating dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a preliminary step that improves the accuracy of its characterization. In this study, DOM in brackish water was clearly separated and evaluated by multiple characterization analyses. The sample was divided into three fractions by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (preparative HPLC) according to molecular size. The homogeneity of each fraction was estimated by analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (FEEM). Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) were used to characterize the physicochemical properties of each fraction. Py-GC/MS revealed that Fraction 1 consisted of evenly distributed organic matter in order polysaccharides, proteins, polyhydroxy aromatics, lignins, and lipids. However, Fraction 2 was primarily composed of dominant lipids and low portion of proteins, and Fraction 3 was composed predominantly of lignins and lipids. The LC-OCD results showed that Fractions 1 and 2 had similar organic carbon (OC) compositions: a humic substance (ca. 37%), building blocks (ca. 10%), and neutrals (ca. 37%), whereas Fraction 3 contained a high proportion of neutrals (62%). In the fouling experiments, the distinct DOM characteristics in each fraction resulted in different declining flux behaviors, ranked as: Fraction 2 > Fraction 1 > Fraction 3. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microbial community dynamics were characterized following combined oxidation and biodegradation treatment trains for mixtures of 1,4-dioxane and chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) in laboratory microcosms. Bioremediation is generally inhibited by co-contaminate CVOCs; with only a few specific bacterial taxa reported to metabolize or cometabolize 1,4-dioxane being unaffected. Chemical oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (H202) as a non-selective treatment demonstrated 50-80% 1,4-dioxane removal regardless of the initial CVOC concentrations. Post-oxidation bioaugmentation with 1,4-dioxane metabolizer Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190 removed the remaining 1,4-dioxane. The intrinsic microbial population, biodiversity, richness, and biomarker gene abundances decreased immediately after the brief oxidation phase, but recovery of cultivable microbiomes and a more diverse community were observed during the subsequent 9-week biodegradation phase. Results generated from the Illumina Miseq sequencing and bioinformatics analyses established that generally oxidative stress tolerant genus Ralstonia was abundant after the oxidation step, and Cupriavidus, Pseudolabrys, Afipia, and Sphingomonas were identified as dominant genera after aerobic incubation. Multidimensional analysis elucidated the separation of microbial populations as a function of time under all conditions, suggesting that temporal succession is a determining factor that is independent of 1,4-dioxane and CVOCs mixtures. Network analysis highlighted the potential interspecies competition or commensalism, and dynamics of micro biomes during the biodegradation phase, in line with the shifts of predominant genera and various developing directions during different steps of the treatment train. Collectively, this study demonstrated that chemical oxidation followed by bioaugmentation is effective for treating 1,4-dioxane, even in the presence of high levels of CVOC mixtures and residual peroxide, a disinfectant, and enhanced our understanding of microbial ecological impacts of the treatment train. These results will be valuable for predicting treatment synergies that lead to cost savings and improved remedial outcomes in short-term active remediation as well as long-term changes to the environmental microbial communities.

AB This study aimed to characterise the gas-liquid flow and mixing behaviour in a gas-mixed anaerobic digester by improving phase interaction modelling using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A 2D axisymmetric model validated with experimental data was set up using an Eulerian-Eulerian method. Uncertainty factors, including bubble size, phase interaction forces and liquid rheology were found to significantly influence the flow field. A more reliable and complete validation was obtained by critical comparison and assessment of the referred experimental data, compared to the models reported in other studies. Additionally, justifiable corrections and predictions in detail were obtained. Mixing was evaluated by trajectory tracking of a large number of particles based on an Euler-Lagrange method. The mixing performance approximated to a laminar-flow reactor (LFR) that distinctly deviated from expected continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) design, indicating limited enhancement from the applied gassparging strategy in the studied digester. The study shows the importance of a proper phase-interaction description for a reliable hydrodynamic characterisation and mixing evaluation in gas mixed digesters. Validations, bend to experimental data without a critical assessment, may lead to an inaccurate model for further scaled-up applications. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Assessment of viral contamination is essential for monitoring the microbial quality of water and protection of public health, as human virus presence is not accurately determined using bacterial indicators. Currently, the time required for conventional viral testing means that water contaminated with human pathogens may be used (e.g. for drinking, recreation or irrigation) days before results are available. Here we report a new rapid method for coliphage enumeration, the QuantiPhage (QP) assay. The novelty of the assay is the use of cellulose absorbent pad materials to support coliphage growth and colorimetric detection, in place of agar that is used in the plaque assay. In addition to saving time associated with agar preparation and tempering, the QP assay enabled enumeration of somatic coliphages in 1.5-2 h and F+ coliphages in 2.5-3 h. The assays were highly sensitive, with a lower detection limit of 1 plaque forming unit (PFU) per mL where 1 mL sample volumes were analysed, and 1 PFU per 10 mL where 10 mL sample volumes were analysed. This is the first rapid culture assay to enable low numbers of coliphages to be reliably detected and to produce directly equivalent results to agar-based plaque assays. A novel gelatin-immobilisation method is also reported, that reduces time to prepare bacterial cells from-20 h to 40 60 min (depending on the assay format), and provides a ready to use form of cells, that is compatible with rapid detection and kit formats. When applied to analysis of somatic coliphages in wastewater samples and surface water samples, mean differences in results of the QP assay and the conventional plaque assay were not statistically significant (mean difference < 0.15 logio PFU/L and 0.5 PFU/10 mL respectively, P > 0.05). The QP is a valuable tool for assessing microbial water quality, which may assist in improving the management of water resources. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemical sulfide removal can be attractive as a zero-chemical-input approach for treatment of waste streams such as spent caustics coupled to caustic recovery. A key concern is possible decline in catalytic activity, due to passivation from deposited elemental sulfur (S-0) on the anode surface and stability limitation, due to sulfide oxidation under highly alkaline conditions. In this study, six commercially available electrode materials (Ir Mixed Metal Oxide (MMO), Ru MMO, Pt/IrOx, Pt, PbOx and TiO2/IrTaO2 coated titanium-based electrodes) were tested to investigate the impact of the electrocatalyst on the process efficiency in terms of sulfide removal and final product of sulfide oxidation, as well as to determine the stability of the electrocatalyst under high sulfide concentrations (50 mM Na2S) and high alkalinity (pH > 12). Short-term experiments showed that the catalyst type impacts the anode potential and the sulfide oxidation reaction products. Longer-term experiments under current densities up to 200 A m(-2) showed a high differentiation in stability performance among the catalysts. Ru MMO was the most active towards sulfide oxidation with a coulombic efficiency of 63.2 +/- 0.5% at an average anode potential of 0.92 +/- 0.17 V vs SHE. Ir MMO was the most stable, preserving 100% of its original catalyst loading during the tests. The results demonstrated that Ru MMO and Ir MMO were the most suitable electrode materials for sulfide oxidation under highly alkaline conditions, while the need for establishing a good trade-off between activity, stability and cost still persists.

AB Evolutionary computation has been applied to predict the occurrence of massive cyanobacteria proliferations; in the present study, this tool was further used to explore the factors responsible for maintaining picocyanobacterial dominance. Aiming to increase the understanding of factors that promote dominance of picocyanobacteria in tropical reservoirs, we chose two reservoirs used for water supplies located in different regions of Brazil and subjected to climate changes such as warmer winters that intensify water column stratification and prolonged dry seasons that cause water level decreases. This study focused on the diagnosis of the relationships among picocyanobacteria (1-2 mu m), zooplankton and environmental variables using evolutionary computation. The integrated data analysis performed here was very successful in elucidating the dynamics of picocyanobacterial density variation influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors by the modeling approach. Relative water column stability - RWCS and electrical conductivity were highlighted as the most important environmental drivers for picocyanobacterial peaks. Hybrid Evolutionary Analysis (HEA) models for the two reservoirs indicated for the first time in the literature that rotifers, small-sized cladocerans and copepods (mainly nauplii) can directly or indirectly control picocyanobacteria in tropical mesotrophic reservoirs, depending on RWCS conditions and electrical conductivity. However, this control is modulated by pH, water transparency and water temperature thresholds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the biodegradability of guanyl urea (GU) and the behavior of other transformation products (TPs) of Metformin (MF). Most biodegradation studies of MF with activated sludge of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) showed GU as the only bacterial dead-end metabolite without further degradation. In this study, batch experiments with activated sludge revealed biodegradability of GU. GU degradation was much faster under anaerobic than under aerobic conditions. Degradation kinetics for MF was much slower under anaerobic conditions. Adsorptive removal of up to 20% was an additional elimination process of MF and GU. The batch experiments were conducted with sludge of 2 WWTPs, WWTP 1 showed decreasing concentrations of GU from influent to effluent and the other increasing concentrations. This indicates a different adaption of the sludge to GU and may explain the better GU degradation capability of the sludge from WWTP 1. Furthermore, the biodegradation potential of MF was confirmed and in addition, occurrence of the TPs methylbiguanide (MBG), 2-amino-4-methylamino-1,3,5-triazine (2,4-AMT) and the secondary TP 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine (2,4-DAT) was observed in batch experiments with activated sludge of WWTP 1. After fast formation, degradation in turn was slower, especially for 2,4-AMT. In general, TPs played a minor role in MF and GU degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A light-weight granular mixed-quartz sand (denoted as L-GQS) combined with stirring-assisted bubble column reactor was firstly applied in catalytic ozonation of atrazine. The L-GQS, with a density of 2.36 g cm(-3) and average diameter of ca. of 4 mm, was readily churned up and uniformly distributed within the solution in the reactor. The introduction of L-GQS was found to exhibit enhanced catalytic ozonation of atrazine, with the increase in degradation rate and the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal being more than 2-fold for the catalytic process (L-GQS dosage = 5 g L-1, [atrazine](0) = 50 mu M, [O-3] = 25 mg L-1, gas flow = 0.2 L min(-1), at pH 7.0 and 293 K). The L-GQS settled at the bottom of the reactor after experimentation, allowing its easy separation from the solution. A complete characterization of the material (XRD, XPS, FTIR, FE-SEM/EDS, BET and pH(pzc)) revealed that L-GQS consisted of alpha-quartz, beta-cristobalite, anorthoclase and small amount of iron oxy-hydroxides. Hydroxyl groups, Bronsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites on the surface of L-GQS all contributed to the atrazine adsorption, ozone decomposition and center dot OH generation. The L-GQS catalyzed ozonation exhibited superior atrazine degradation and mineralization rates in a wide range of pH (3.0-9.0) and reaction temperatures (278 K-293 K). Also, an enhancement of DOC abatement was observed both in presence of natural organic matter isolates and natural water matrices (river water) when L-GQS was used. Finally, the degradation mechanism was proposed, based on the intermediates and by-products formation analyzed by LC-QTOF-MS/MS and ionic chromatography. Our results indicate that the L-GQS combined with stirring-assisted bubble column reactor could be utilized as an enhancement of ozone-based advanced oxidation processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work studied simultaneous bromate (BrO3-) reduction and adsorption of perchlorate (ClO4-) by FeCl3-impregnated granular activated carbon (Fe-GAC) and the mutual co-solute effects. We report that BrO3- reduction by Fe-GAC was coupled with enhanced adsorption of ClO4- by the material. The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity for ClO4- by Fe-GAC was increased from 0.179 mmol g(-1), (without BrO3-) to 0.256 mmol g(-1) in the presence of 0.2 mmol L-1 of BrO3- (a 43% increase) at pH 6.0. While the activated carbon alone was able simultaneously remove both BrO3- and ClO4-, Fe-GAC offered much greater removal efficacy and synergistic effect, likely because the immobilized Fe3+ acted as a catalyst and provided a local acidic environment, both being in favor of accelerated BrO3- reduction. Mechanistic analyses revealed that BrO3- removal was through a two-step process: ion exchange with OH- and Cl- on Fe-GAC, and then Fe-catalyzed reduction of BrO3- to Br- by carbon. The carbon-BrO3- redox reaction generated more Fe-O and C-O groups on the material surface, which can bind with ClO4- by surface complexation and electrostatic interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first report that metal modified activated carbon may facilitate synergistic removal of both BrO3- and ClO4-, which are common co-solutes in contaminated waters.

AB A novel granulation strategy by applying the low-intensity direct current (DC) electric field via reactive iron anode into the aerobic granular sludge (AGS) system was systematically investigated in this study. Three identical sequencing batch reactors (SBRs, namely R1, R2, and R3) were operated for 100 days. Comparatively, the R1 and R3 were continuously subjected to the 1.0 V DC electric field via a reactive Fe anode and an inert Ti-Ir/Rh anode, respectively, while the R2 without DC exposure. The results showed that the sludge granulation processes were accelerated in order as follows: R2<R3<R1, and the properties of mature granules were improved in order as follows: R3<R2<R1. Interestingly, at the end of experiment, total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiency in R1 dramatically increased to 80.52%, which was 2.15 and 1.96 folds than that in R2 and R3, respectively. Further investigations revealed that this novel strategy could simultaneously improve the secretion of EPS and the release of iron ions in R1, which cooperatively enhanced the granulation process. Moreover, in R1, mineral precipitation of phosphate remarkably improved the capability of phosphorus removal. The observed effective and stable performance highlights the feasibility and potential of this novel strategy for the rapid start-up and stable operation of AGS system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Degradation of propranolol (PrP) by a combined zero-valent iron and sulfite system under simulated sunlight irradiation (ZVI/sulfite/photo) was investigated. Simulated sunlight irradiation enhanced the degradation of PrP by accelerating the decomposition of ferric sulfite complex as a result to producing sulfite radical (SO3 center dot-). As bubbles would block the transport of photons in the reaction solution, mechanical aeration rather than purging air was suggested to sustain the essential dissolved oxygen. The degradation of PrP increased with the elevation of initial ZVI concentration from 0.05 to 0.5 mM, but decreased a little with further increasing ZVI concentration to 1.0 mM. The degradation of PrP raised from 68.5% to 98.7% while sulfite dose increased from 0.1 to 2.0 mM. High removal efficiencies were always achieved when the initial PrP concentration ranged from 10 to 40 mu M. As HSO3- which can efficiently complex Fe(II) and transfer Fe(III) to Fe(II) is the dominant species of sulfite at pH 4.0-6.0, the highest removal of PrP was achieved at pH 4.0-6.0. The presence of bicarbonate and humic acid significantly retarded the removal of PrP, while chloride ions could promote the removal of PrP to some extent. SO4 center dot-, HO center dot and SO5 center dot- were suggested to account for PrP removal, while SO4 center dot- was evidenced to be the dominant radicals. Good reuse of ZVI in the system was also achieved as the removal of PrP kept higher than 80% after repeatedly used for 5 times. Possible degradation pathways of PrP in the ZVI/sulfite/photo system were accordingly proposed based on LC-MS and density functional theory calculation. The removal of amitriptyline, nitrobenzene, imipramine and methylparaben in the ZVI/sulfite/photo system was also evaluated. As a reducing agent, sulfite is expected to consume the possible formed bromine-containing intermediates as a result to inhibiting the formation of bromate, which is better than the activated persulfate system.

AB The rapid construction of reservoir in river basin generates a river-reservoir system containing an environmental gradient from river system to reservoir system in modern aquatic environment worldwide. Profiles of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in river-reservoir system is essential to better understand their dynamic mechanisms in aquatic eco-environment. In this study, we investigated the diversity, abundance, distribution of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in a representative river-reservoir system using high-throughput quantitative PCR, as well as ranked the factors (e.g. antibiotics, bacterial biomass, bacteria communities, and MGEs) influencing the patterns of ARGs based on structural equation models (SEMs). Seasonal variations in absolute abundance of ARGs and MGEs exhibited similar trends with local rainfall, suggesting that seasonal runoff induced by the rainfall potentially promote the absolute abundance of ARGs and MGEs. In contrast, environmental gradient played more important roles in the detected number, relative abundance, distribution pattern of ARGs and MGEs in the river-reservoir system. Moreover, environmental gradient also made the co-occurrence patterns associated with ARGs subtypes, MGEs and bacteria genera in river system different from those in reservoir system. The SEMs revealed that MGEs contributed the most to shape the ARG profiles. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of environmental gradient on ARGs dynamics in river-reservoir system, probably via influencing the MGEs, antibiotics, pathogenic bacteria community and nonpathogenic bacteria community.

AB Soluble Mn(III) species stabilized by natural organic matter (NOM) plays a crucial role in a number of biogeochemical processes. To date, current understanding of these phenomena has been primarily concerned on the occurrence and chemistry of soluble NOM-Mn(III) complexes; much less is known regarding the formation and stability of NOM-Mn(III) colloids in the environment. This presents a critical knowledge gap with regard to biogeochemical cycling of manganese and associated carbon, and for predicting the fate and transport of colloid-associated contaminants, nutrients, and trace metals. In this work, we have characterized the chemical and physical properties of humic acid based (HA)-Mn(III) colloids formed over a range of environmentally relevant conditions and quantified their subsequent aggregation and stability behaviors. Results show that molar C/Mn ratios and HA types (Aldrich HA (AHA) and Pahokee peat soil HA (PPSHA)) are critical factors influencing HA-Mn(III) colloidal properties. Both the amount and the stability of HA-Mn(III) colloids increased with increasing initial molar C/Mn ratios, regardless of HA type. The correlation between the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) and zeta potential (R-2 > 0.97) suggests that both Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) type and non-DLVO interactions are responsible for enhanced stability of HA-Mn(III) colloids. For a given C/Mn ratio, PPSHA-Mn(III) colloids are significantly more stable against aggregation than AHA-Mn(Ill) colloids, which is likely due to stronger electrostatic interactions, hydration interactions, and steric hindrance. Further examination in real-world waters indicates that the HA-Mn(III) colloids are highly stable in surface river water, but become unstable (i.e. extensive aggregation) in solutions representing a groundwater-seawater interaction zone. Overall, this study provides new insights into the formation and stability of NOM-Mn(III) colloids which are critical for understanding Mn-based colloidal behavior(s), and thus Mn cycling processes, in aquatic systems.

AB Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrhoea and infant mortality worldwide. A better understanding of the sources, fate and transport of Cryptosporidium via rivers is important for effective management of waterborne transmission, especially in the developing world. We present GloWPa-Crypto C1, the first global, spatially explicit model that computes Cryptosporidium concentrations in rivers, implemented on a 0.5 x 0.5 degrees grid and monthly time step. To this end, we first modelled Cryptosporidium inputs to rivers from human faeces and animal manure. Next, we use modelled hydrology from a grid-based macroscale hydrological model (the Variable Infiltration Capacity model). Oocyst transport through the river network is modelled using a routing model, accounting for temperature- and solar radiation-dependent decay and sedimentation along the way.
   Monthly average oocyst concentrations are predicted to range from 10(-6) to 10(2) oocysts L-1 in most places. Critical regions ('hotspots') with high concentrations include densely populated areas in India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Nigeria, Algeria and South Africa, Mexico, Venezuela and some coastal areas of Brazil, several countries in Western and Eastern Europe (incl. The UK, Belgium and Macedonia), and the Middle East. Point sources (human faeces) appears to be a more dominant source of pollution than diffuse sources (mainly animal manure) in most world regions.
   Validation shows that GloWPa-Crypto medians are mostly within the range of observed concentrations. The model generally produces concentrations that are 1.5-2 log10 higher than the observations. This is likely predominantly due to the absence of recovery efficiency of the observations, which are therefore likely too low. Goodness of fit statistics are reasonable. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model is most sensitive to changes in input oocyst loads.
   GloWPa-Crypto C1 paves the way for many new opportunities at the global scale, including scenario analysis to investigate the impact of global change and management options on oocysts concentrations in rivers, and risk analysis to investigate human health risk.

AB In this study, a novel manner of bio-electric field (BEF) which generated by upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)-microbial fuel cell (MFC) integrated system facilitated iron-carbon micro-electrolysis in blast furnace dusting ash (BFDA) was proposed for the reinforcement of anaerobic digestion in UASB. The responses of COD removal efficiency and biogas production with (0.1-0.4 V) BEF catalyzed 5 g BFDA(RMFC-5gBFDA-UASB) were much higher than the other tests, and maximum reached 86% and 240 ml/d respectively. Ultra-fast acidogenesis was achieved with 0.3 V BEF supplied to BFDA and the time shortened 94 h compared controlled (R-UASB) with RMFC-5gBFDA-UASB. With the electrochemical and microbial community analysis, the redox ability and direct interspecies electron transfer accumulated with BEF catalyzed. The abundance of Firmicutes which could generate bio-hydrogen was highest in RMFC-5gBFDA-UASB (44.58%) compared to R-UASB (31.36%) and R5gBFDA-UASB (40.04%). In addition, the structure and morphology variation of BFDA revealed that the synergistic effects of BEF stimulated iron-carbon micro-electrolysis for electron transferring and enhanced the activities of methanogens and acetogens with high relative abundance to biotransform organic compounds, as well as adsorption and precipitation of iron oxides (hematite and magnetite) promoting anaerobic digestion. The MFC-BFDA-UASB integrated system provides a promising and cost-effective way to enhance anaerobic digestion and recycled functionalized waste effectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The present work addresses the synthesis of nanofiltration composite membranes with bactericide properties. The cellulose acetate based membranes with polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nano particles, silver ion-exchanged beta-zeolite and beta-zeolite are casted by the phase inversion technique and subjected to an annealing post-treatment. They are characterized in terms of the nanofiltration permeation performance and antibacterial properties.
   The incorporation of silver nanoparticles produces a threefold increase in the membrane hydraulic permeability when compared to the silver-free membranes and the incorporation of silver ion loaded zeolite resulted in a 56.3% increase in hydraulic permeability. In contrast to the influence of silver presence, either in nanometric or in the ionic form, the presence of zeolite does not significantly influence the hydraulic permeability. The rejection coefficients to salts range from 83% to 93% for the silver ion-exchanged zeolite membrane and from 84% to 97% for the polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles membrane. They are higher for sulfate salts than for chloride salts.
   The antibacterial properties of the membranes were evaluated against Escherichia coli. The results have shown that the silver ion-exchanged beta-zeolite membrane was effective in inactivating Escherichia coli after just 210 min of contact time. No bacterial activity was detected following 24 h of contact time with the membrane containing polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles. A reduction of more than 6-log, in the number of Escherichia coli, was achieved for both membranes. The different patterns of bactericide activity are associated to the silver speciation in metallic or ionic form.
   The high flux nanofiltration composite membranes with bactericidal properties represent a strong asset in water treatment biofouling control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) is a novel wastewater treatment technology based on oxygen-supplying membranes. The counter diffusion of oxygen and electron donors in MABRs leads to unique behavior, and we hypothesized it also could impact predation. We used optical coherence tomography (OCT), microsensor analyses, and mathematical modeling to investigate predation in membrane-aerated biofilms (MABs). When protozoa were excluded from the inoculum, the MAB's OCT-observable void fraction was around 5%. When protozoa were included, the void fraction grew to nearly 50%, with large, continuous voids at the base of the biofilm. Real-time OCT imaging showed highly motile protozoa in the voids. MABs with protozoa and a high bulk COD (270 mg/L) only had 4% void fraction. DNA sequencing revealed a high relative abundance of amoeba in both high and low-COD MABs. Flagellates were only abundant in the low-COD MAB. Modeling also suggested a relationship between substrate concentrations, diffusion mode (co- or counter-diffusion), and bioflim void fraction. Results suggest that amoeba proliferate in the bioflim interior, especially in the aerobic zones. Voids form once COD limitation at the base of MABs allows predation rates to exceed microbial growth rates. Once formed, the voids provide a niche for motile protozoa, which expand the voids into a large, continuous gap. This increases the potential for biofilm sloughing, and may have detrimental effects on slow-growing, aerobic microorganisms such as nitrifying bacteria. (C)2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) are increasingly detected as aquatic contaminants and exist as different dissociated species depending on the pH of the water. Their removal in sunlit surface waters is governed by photochemical transformation. Here we report a detailed examination of the hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) mediated photooxidation of nine SAs: sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethizole, sulfathiazole, sulfamethazine, sulfamerazine, sulfadiazine, sulfachloropyridazine and sulfadimethoxine. Both center dot OH and O-1(2) oxidation kinetics varied depending on the dominant protonated states of the SA in question (H2SAs+, HSAs0 and SAs-) as a function of pH. Based on competition kinetic experiments and matrix deconvolution calculations, HSAs0 or SAs- (pH similar to 5-8) were observed to be more highly reactive towards center dot OH, while SAs- (pH similar to 8) react the fastest with O-1(2) for most of the SAs tested. Using the empirically derived rates of reaction for the speciated forms at different pHs, the environmental half-lives were determined using typical O-1(2) and center dot OH concentrations observed in the environment. This approach suggests that photochemical O-1(2) oxidation contributes more than center dot OH oxidation and direct photolysis to the overall phototransformation of SAs in sunlit waters. Based on the identification of key photointermediates using tandem mass spectrometry, O-1(2) oxidation generally occurred at the amino moiety on the molecule, whereas center dot OH reaction experienced multi-site hydroxylation. Both these reactions preserve the basic parent structure of the compounds and raise concerns that the routes of phototransformation give rise to intermediates with similar antimicrobial potency as the parent SAs. We therefore recommend that these phototransformation pathways are included in risk assessments concerning the presence and fate of SAs in waste and surface waters. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB The effect of turbulence on phytoplankton growth has been widely studied; however, its effects with respects to suspended particulate matter (SPM) on the development of phytoplankton communities and the behavioral responses of phytoplankton to turbulence and SPM are poorly understood. Here, an approximately homogeneous turbulence simulation system (ANTS, mainly consisting of an oscillating grid apparatus) was established to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying phytoplankton community responses in turbid, well-mixed waters. The results revealed that maintaining the turbulence dissipation rates (epsilon) of 2.25 x 10(-3) and 1.80 x 10(-2) m(2)/s(3) caused significant reductions in algal density, and the effects could be substantially enhanced when 500 mg/L of SPM were added before day 12. In contrast to the constant decrease of algal density for the epsilon of 2.25 x 10(-3) m(2)/s(3), a dramatic increase in the phytoplankton density occurred after 16 days of incubation for a epsilon of 1.80 x 10(-2) m(2)/s(3), irrespective of SPM. Addition of SPM in the epsilon of 1.80 x 10(-2) m(2)/s(3) treatments did not considerably affect the algal density profile compared to that without SPM, of which unicellular algae decreased and colonial algae dominated the phytoplankton community. On the other hand, the phytoplankton can regulate the SPM properties. During the 18 days' coincubation, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) released from algal cells induced larger particle sizes and round surfaces of SPM, which can reduce the damage received to algal cells. Here we demonstrated that the phytoplankton communities could actively counteract the effects of turbulence + SPM and adapt the couple stress, jointly through the release of EPS, the modification of SPM surface properties and the conversion of their assemblage pattern, thereby contributing to rebalance the ecosystem. These findings highlight the strategies employed during the reconstruction of phytoplankton under the dual effects of turbulence and SPM for the first time, consequently enabling the forecasting of the dominant species of phytoplankton in turbulent waters.

AB Biofouling of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane is a significant issue for the water treatment industry. In this study, we apply the metagenomic shot-gun sequencing technology to characterise the composition and functional potential of the microbial community in a full-scale RO plant, at different stages of seawater treatment. We find Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes to be the most abundant bacterial phyla. The genetic potential of the RO membrane microbial community shows the enrichment of genes involved in biofilm formation, representing the selective pressure of the biofilm formation process. We recover 31 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from intake (raw seawater), fouled RO membranes (leading and middle RO module) and brine reject water. A total of 25 MAGs are recovered from the biofilm samples (leading and middle RO modules), with 9 of them (36%) belonging to Planctomycetes. We investigate all 25 MAGs for genes (pili, flagella, quorum sensing, quorum quenching and nitrate reduction) that play an important role in biofilm formation and sustenance of cells. We show that Planctomycetes contain genes for the formation of flagella and pili, and the reduction of nitrate. Although genes for quorum sensing are not detected, quorum quenching genes are identified in the biofilm MAGs. Our results show that Planctomycetes, along with other microbes, play an important role in the formation and sustenance of biofilms on seawater RO membranes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Photo-driven advanced oxidation process (AOP) with peracetic acid (PAA) has been poorly investigated in water and wastewater treatment so far. In the present work its possible use as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater to effectively minimize the release into the environment of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria was investigated. Different initial PAA concentrations, two light sources (sunlight and UV-C) and two different water matrices (groundwater (GW) and wastewater (WW)) were studied. Low PM doses were found to be effective in the inactivation of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli (AR E. coli) in GW, with the UV-C process being faster (limit of detection (LOD) achieved for a cumulative energy (Q(UV)) of 0.3 kJL(-1) with 0.2 mg PAA L-1) than solar driven one (LOD achieved at Q(UV) = 4.4 kJL(-1) with 0.2 mg PM L-1). Really fast inactivation rates of indigenous AR E. coli were also observed in WW. Higher Q(UV) and PM initial doses were necessary to effectively remove the three target CECs (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole), with CBZ being the more refractory one. In conclusion, photo-driven AOP with PM can be effectively used as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater but initial PM dose should be optimized to find the best compromise between target bacteria inactivation and CECs removal as well as to prevent scavenging effect of PM on hydroxyl radicals because of high PM concentration.

AB Due to the significant public health risks, there is substantial scientific interest in the increasing abundance of antibiotic-resistance bacteria (ARB) and the spread of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments. To clearly understand the mechanism of ARG transfer, this study examined the conjugative transfer of genes encoding resistance to cephalosporin (bla(CTX)) and polymyxin (mcr-1) from two antibiotic-resistant donor strains, namely E. coli DH5 alpha (CTX) and E. coli DH5 alpha (MCR), and to a streptomycin-resistant receptor strain (E. coli C600 (Sm)). Conjugative transfer was specifically studied under different light irradiation conditions including visible light (VL), simulated sunlight (SS) and ultraviolet light (UV254nm). Results show that the conjugative transfer frequency was not affected by VL irradiation, while it was slightly improved (2-10 fold) by SS irradiation and extremely accelerated (up to 100 fold) by UV irradiation. Furthermore, this study also explored the link between ARG transfer and stress conditions. This was done by studying physiological and biochemical changes; oxidative stress response; and functional gene expression of co-cultured AR-E. coli strains under stress conditions. When correlated with the transfer frequency results, we found that VL irradiation did not affect the physiological and biochemical characteristics of the bacteria, or induce oxidative stress and gene expression. For SS irradiation, oxidative stress occurred slowly, with a slight increase in the expression of target genes in the bacterial cells. In contrast, UV irradiation, rapidly inactivated the bacteria, the degree of oxidative stress was very severe and the expression of the target genes was markedly up-regulated. Our study could provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms and links between accelerated conjugative transfer and oxidative stress, as well as the altered expression of genes relevant to conjugation and other stress responses in bacterial cells.

AB Oily wastewater is a large waste stream produced by a number of industries. This wastewater often forms stable oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. These emulsions require demulsification in order to effectively treat the water prior to release. Although biological demulsification of O/W emulsion has advantages over traditional approaches, its development is at a preliminary stage with few demulsifying bacteria reported and a need for effective screening methods for such bacteria. In this study, thirty-seven marine O/W emulsion demulsifying bacterial strains belonging to 5 genera and 15 species were reported. Cell hydrophobicity and interfacial activity played key roles in the emulsion breaking. One of the highly effective demulsifying bacteria, Halomonas venusta strain N3-2A was identified and characterized. Both its extracellular biosurfactant and cell surface contributed to demulsification resulting in breaking of 92.5% of the emulsion within 24 h. A high throughput and effective screening strategy targeting O/W emulsion breaking bacteria using oil spreading test coupled with cell hydrophobicity test was proposed. In addition, the 37 demulsifying bacteria showed a certain degree of species/genus specific patterns of surface activity and cell hydrophobicity. The reported bacteria and the screening strategy have promising potential for the biological demulsification of O/W emulsions and oily wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Catastrophic regime shifts in shallow lakes are hard to predict due to a lack of clear understanding of the associate mechanisms. Theory of alternative stable states suggests that eutrophication has profound negative effects on the structure, function and stability of freshwater ecosystems. However, it is still unclear how eutrophication destabilizes ecosystems stoichiometrically before a tipping point is reached. The stoichiometric homeostasis (H), which links fine-scale process to broad-scale patterns, is a key parameter in ecological stoichiometry. Based on investigation of 97 shallow lakes on the Yangtze Plain, China, we measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations of the aboveground tissues of common submerged macrophyte species and their corresponding sediments. We found submerged macrophytes showed significant stoichiometric homeostasis for P (H-p) but not for N (H-N). Furthermore, H-p was positively correlated with dominance and stability at the species level, and community production and stability at the community level. Identifying where macrophyte community collapse is a fundamental way to quantify their resilience. Threshold detection showed that macrophyte community dominated by high-H-p species had a higher value of tipping point (0.08 vs. 0.06 mg P L-1 in lake water), indicating their strong resilience to eutrophication. In addition, macrophytes with high H-p were predominant in relative oligotrophic sediments and have higher ability in stabilizing the water environment compared to those low-H-p ones. Our results suggested that ecosystem dominated by homeostatic macrophyte communities was more productive, stable and resilient to eutrophication. Eutrophication-induced stoichiometric imbalance may destabilize the ecosystem by altering the community structure from high-to low-H-p species. Efforts should be focused on maintaining and restoration of high homeostatic communities to make ecosystem more resilient, which can significantly improve our understanding of the critical transition mechanisms.

AB Chemical dosing is a commonly used strategy for mitigating sewer corrosion and odour problems caused by sulfide production. Prediction of sewage flow variation in real-time is critical for the optimization of chemical dosing to achieve cost-effective mitigation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Autoregressive (AR) models have previously been used for real-time sewage prediction. However, the prediction showed significant delays in wet weather conditions. In this paper, autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) models are employed to reduce the delays with rainfall data used as model inputs. The model is applied to predicting sewage flows at two real-life sewage pumping stations (SPSs) with different hydraulic characteristics and climatic conditions. The calibrated models were capable of predicting flow rates in both cases, much more accurately than previously developed AR models under wet weather conditions. Simulation of on-line chemical dosing control based on the predicted flows showed excellent sulfide mitigation performance at reduced cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment processes with granular sludge are compact and are becoming increasingly popular. Interest has been accompanied by the development of mathematical models. This contribution simultaneously reviews available models in the scientific literature for anaerobic, aerobic and partial nitritation-anammox granular sludge reactors because they comprise common phenomena (e.g. liquid, gas and granule transport) and thus pose similar challenges. Many of the publications were found to have no clearly defined goal. The importance of a goal is stressed because it determines the appropriate model complexity and helps other potential users to find a suitable model in the vast amount of literature. Secondly, a wide variety was found in the model features. This review explains the chosen modelling assumptions based on the different reactor types and goals wherever possible, but some assumptions appeared to be habitual within fields of research, without clear reason. We therefore suggest further research to more clearly define the range of operational conditions and goals for which certain simplifying assumptions can be made, e.g. when intragranule solute transport can be lumped in apparent kinetics and when biofilm models are needed, which explicitly calculate substrate concentration gradients inside granules. Furthermore, research is needed to better mechanistically understand detachment, removal of influent particulate matter and changes in the mixing behaviour inside anaerobic systems, before these phenomena can be adequately incorporated in models. Finally, it is suggested to perform full-scale model validation studies for aerobic and anammox reactors. A spreadsheet in the supplementary information provides an overview of the features in the 167 reviewed models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to examine the drivers in shaping the occurrence and distribution of total viruses and picoplankton in tropical freshwater ecosystems. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the concentrations of total viruses, picoheterotrophs, picophytoplankton, and picocyanobacteria. Three land use patterns (urban-, agriculture- and parkland-dominated) were evaluated using ArcGIS. Significant correlations were observed between water-borne microbial targets and water quality parameters (0.175 <= vertical bar r vertical bar <= 0.441), nutrients (0.250 <= r <= 0.570) and land use factors (0.200 <= vertical bar r vertical bar <= 0.460). In particular, the concentrations of total viruses and picoheterotrophic cells were higher in catchments whereas the abundances of picophytoplankton and picocyanobacteria were higher in reservoirs. Total viruses and picoplankton had higher concentrations in urban- and agriculture-dominated areas, probably due to anthropogenic inputs and agricultural inputs, respectively. Although surface water is a complex matrix influenced by niche based (i.e., physicochemical properties, nutrients, land use impact etc.) and neutral-based factors (i.e., ecological drift, dispersal and species), land use patterns could help to elucidate the occurrence and distribution of the total microbial community at the macroscopic level. Meanwhile, inter-correlations among viruses, picoplankton and picoheterotrophs (0.715 <= r <= 0.990) also substantiates their mutual interactions in influencing the microbial community. Furthermore, the relationships between total microbial cells and bacterial and viral indicators were also investigated. Concentrations of total viruses, picoplankton and picoheterotrophs were positively correlated with bacterial indicators (0.427 <= r <= 0.590) and viral indicators (0.201 <= r <= 0.563). These results indicated that faecal and viral contamination could contribute to the numbers of total viruses and bacteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial communities are the main drivers of biogeochemical cycling of multiple elements sustaining life in the ocean. The rapidity of their response to stressors and abrupt environmental changes implies that even fast and infrequent events can affect local transformations of organic matter and nutrients. Modern molecular techniques now allow for monitoring of microbial activities and functions in the environment through the analysis of genes and expressed genes contained in natural microbial assemblages. However, messenger RNA turnover in cells can be as short as 30 seconds and stability varies greatly between transcripts. Sampling of in situ communities involves an inevitable delay between the collection of seawater and the extraction of its RNA, leaving the bacterial communities plenty of time to alter their gene expression. The characteristics of microbial RNA turnover make time-series very difficult because samples need to be processed immediately to limit alterations to the metatranscriptomes.
   To address these challenges we designed an autonomous in situ fixation multi-sampler (AFISsys) for the reliable sampling of microbial metatranscriptomes at frequent intervals, for refined temporal resolution. To advance the development of this instrument, we examined the minimal seawater volume necessary for adequate coverage of community gene expression, and the suitability of phenol/ethanol fixation for immediate and long-term preservation of transcripts from a microbial community. We then evaluated the field eligibility of the instrument itself, with two case studies in a brackish system. AFISsys is able to collect, fix, and store water samples independently at a predefined temporal resolution. Phenol/ethanol fixation can conserve metatranscriptomes directly in the environment for up to a week, for later analysis in the laboratory. Thus, the AFISsys constitutes an invaluable tool for the integration of molecular functional analyses in environmental monitoring in brackish waters and in aquatic environments in general.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) has emerged as a potentially energy-efficient membrane treatment technology to yield high-quality reusable water from various wastewater/saline water sources. A key challenge remained to be solved for FO is reverse solute flux (RSF), which can cause issues like reduced concentration gradient and loss of draw solutes. Yet no universal parameters have been developed to compare RSF control performance among various studies, making it difficult to position us in this "battle" against RSF. In this paper, we have conducted a concise review of existing RSF reduction approaches, including operational strategies (e.g., pressure-, electrolysis-, and ultrasound-assisted osmosis) and advanced membrane development (e.g., new membrane fabrication and existing membrane modification). We have also analyzed the literature data to reveal the current status of RSF reduction. A new parameter, mitigation ratio (MR), was proposed and used together with specific RSF (SRSF) to evaluate RSF reduction performance. Potential research directions have been discussed to help with future RSF control. This review intends to shed more light on how to effectively tackle solute leakage towards a more cost-effective and environmental-friendly FO treatment process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The microbiological water quality of drinking water distribution system (DWDS) is of primary importance for human health. High-throughput sequencing has gained more and more attention in the last decade to describe this microbial diversity in water networks. However, there are few studies describing this approach on large drinking water distribution systems and for extended periods of time. To fill this gap and observe the potential subtle variation in microbiota of a water network through time and space, we aimed to apply high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene approach to characterize bacterial communities of the Paris' DWDS over a one-year period. In this study, the Paris network, composed of four different DWDSs, was sampled at 31 sites, each month for one year. The sampling campaign was one of the largest described so far (n = 368) and the importance of key spatio-temporal and physico-chemical parameters was investigated. Overall, 1321 taxa were identified within the Paris network, although only fifteen of them were found in high relative abundance (>1%) in all samples. Two genera, Phreatobacter and Hyphomicrobium were dominant. The whole bacterial diversity was not significantly affected between the four DWDSs (spatial parameter) and by physico-chemical parameters. However, the bacterial diversity was slightly modified over the one-year period (temporal parameter) as we were able to observe DWDS microbiome perturbations, presumably linked to a preceding flood event. Comparison of high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons vs. cultivation-based techniques showed that only 1.8% of bacterial diversity was recovered through cultivation. High throughput sequencing has made it possible to monitor DWDS more accurately than conventional methods by describing the whole diversity and detecting slight fluctuations in bacterial communities. This method would be further used to supervise drinking water networks, to follow any perturbations due to internals events (such as treatments) or external events (such as flooding).

AB The ability of soils and sediments to promote in-situ activation of persulfate and persulfate combined with hydrogen peroxide was investigated for treatment of 1,4-dioxane (dioxane). Experiments were conducted with both batch-reactor and column systems to examine reaction rates and activation mechanisms. Four soils and aquifer sediments were used. ICP-MS and XRD analyses were used to characterize geochemical properties of the solutions and sediments, while EPR spectroscopy was used to characterize radical formation. For the batch experiments, degradation of dioxane was significantly greater in the presence of each of the four subsurface geomedia compared to the controls with no geomedia. This indicates that all four geomedia induced oxidant activation, thereby enhancing dioxane degradation. Dioxane degradation was significantly enhanced by the addition of peroxide to the per sulfate solution. It is hypothesized that iron associated with the geomedia is primarily responsible for activation, and that the degree of degradation enhancement relates in part to dissolved-phase iron content. EPR results indicate that manganese oxides and soil organic matter may also have contributed to some degree to persulfate activation, and that manganese oxides enhanced activation of peroxide under the study conditions. Approximately 10% of dioxane was degraded in the miscible-displacement experiments, consistent with the short residence time compared to dioxane's half-life. The pseudo first-order rate coefficients obtained from the batch and column experiments were similar. The results of this study indicate that subsurface geomedia can induce activation of persulfate and peroxide to enhance in-situ chemical oxidation applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although conventional coagulation pre-treatment can mitigate the fouling of ultrafiltration (UF) membrane when treating raw waters, it is insufficient to restrict the development of irreversible fouling and reversible fouling to a low level. In this paper we demonstrate that the intermittent addition of H2O2 into the membrane tank during backwash events (after coagulation pre-treatment) successfully prevented the development of any significant membrane fouling. Laboratory-scale tests were undertaken using two membrane systems operated in parallel over 60 days, one serving as a reference coagulation-ultrafiltration (CUF) process, and the other receiving the H2O2 (CUF-H2O2), with a decreasing dose in three successive phases: 10, 5 and 2 mg/L. The results showed that the addition of H2O2 (via a separate dosing tube) during a 1 min backwash process (at 30 min intervals) reduced the growth of bacteria in the membrane tank, and the associated concentrations of soluble microbial products (SMP, including protein and polysaccharide). This resulted in a much reduced cake layer, which contained significantly less high MW organic matter (>50%), such as EPS, thereby improving the interaction between particles in the cake layer and/or particles and the membrane surface. There was also less organic matter, of all MW fractions, adsorbed in the membrane pores of the CUF-H2O2 system. The addition of H2O2 in the membrane tank appeared to alter the nature of the organic matter with a conversion of hydrophobic to hydrophilic fractions, which induced less organics adsorption within the hydrophobic PVDF membrane pores, and a reduced bonding ability for particles. There was no physico-chemical evidence of any deterioration of the membrane from exposure to H2O2, which indicates the feasibility of applying this novel method of fouling control for full-scale UF based water treatment processes.

TI Increasing capacity of an anaerobic sludge digester through FNA
   pre-treatment of thickened waste activated sludge

   production; Dewaterability
ID FREE NITROUS-ACID; CO-DIGESTION; BIODEGRADABILITY; TIME
AB Free nitrous acid (FNA) pre-treatment has been previously demonstrated to be effective in enhancing methane production and volatile solids (VS) destruction in the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge for an equivalent hydraulic retention time (HRT). We hypothesise that, due to enhancement of hydrolysis kinetics, FNA pre-treatment will also allow reduction in the HRT while retaining performance. This would allow for improvement of capacity constrained digesters. Two anaerobic sludge digesters (control-experiment) were fed with the same thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) from a full-scale plant for 6 months. With 24 h pre-treatment of TWAS at an FNA concentration of 6.1 mgN/L (NO2-N = 250 mg/L, pH = 5.0, T = 25 degrees C), the HRT for the experimental anaerobic digester was progressively reduced from 15 days to 12 days and then to 7.5 days. In comparison, the control reactor was operated at a constant HRT of 15 days, representing typical loading conditions. With the shortened HRTs, the experimental AD reactor achieved VS destruction at 36.9 +/- 0.8% (12 days) and 36.8 +/- 1.0% (7.5 days), representing 30-40% relative increase in comparison to the control reactor (at 26.5 +/- 0.8% and 283 +/- 0.7%, respectively, in the same two periods). This was supported by a similar (31-35%) increase in the methane production per unit of VS fed. The volumetric methane production rate of the experimental digester was increased by 165% at HRT of 7.5 days compared with the control digester at HRT of 15 days. The results demonstrated that FNA pre-treatment of TWAS can substantially increase the capacity of an anaerobic sludge digester, with a highly favourable economic outcome. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID FEAR APPEALS; WATER; DROUGHT; CONSUMPTION; ATTITUDE
AB Faced with the threat of "Day Zero", when it was feared that Cape Town's taps could run dry, consumers reduced household water usage from 540 to 280 L per household per day over the 36 months between January 2015 and January 2018. This paper describes the events that prompted this reduction. We look at how changes in water use were affected by official announcements and by public engagement with this news via the social media activity and internet searches. We analysed the water usage of a subset of middle to high income households where smart hot and cold water meters were installed. For hot water usage patterns we compared meter readings with that in another area unaffected by the drought. We further map our cold water smart meter readings against that of the City of Cape Town's municipal data for domestic freestanding households a sample of more than 400,000 households. We found that the introduction of Level 5 restrictions had a perverse effect on consumption, possibly due to confusing messages. The most dramatic change in behaviour appears to have been instigated by a media storm and consequent user panic after the release of the City's Critical Water Shortages Disaster Plan in October 2017. However, contradictory communication from national and provincial government eroded some of this gain. The paper concludes with recommendations for demand management in a similar future scenario.

AB Harmful algal blooms are occurring more frequently in fresh water throughout the world. Certain cyanobacteria can produce and release potent toxic compounds, known as cyanotoxins, such as microcystins, cylindrospermopsin, saxitoxin, and anatoxin-a, and as such they have become a human and environmental health concern. Hybrid photocatalytic composites (HPCs) comprising carbon nanotubes on the surface of TiO2 nanotubes were designed in this study. The HPCs have a selective adsorption capacity to cyanotoxins and provide photocatalytic activity to produce reactive oxygen species for the degradation of cyanotoxins. HPCs with 5.2 mg carbon nanotubes/cm(2) showed an excellent removal efficiency of microcystins-LR (>95%) at 55.6 L/m(2)/hr/bar. The HPCs more efficiently removed the relatively larger and more hydrophobic cyanotoxins (i.e., microcystin-LR) than the relatively smaller and more hydrophilic compounds, such as cylindrospermopsin, saxitoxin, and anatoxin-a. With a further increased in the carbon nanotube content to 8.6 mg/cm(2), the adsorption capacity of the HPCs for cyanotoxins increased to 70.6% for MC-LR. However, there was significant decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the HPCs for production of reactive oxygen species, and consequently a decrease in the degradation of cyanotoxins. It is considered that this device could be used to provide complete rejection of particles and pathogens, and also to significantly reduce trace organic compounds and harmful algal toxins in emergency water supplies.

AB The sulfonamide antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (SMX) has been frequently detected in the wastewater. It has been reported that part of SMX can be transformed by the co-metabolism of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) during nitrifying process. However, previous studies reported inconsistent or even contradictory results in terms of SMX degradation and/or transformation. Literature study revealed that nitrite may play certain role in SMX transformation, which has been neglected previously. In this study, the transformation behavior of SMX was investigated with and without the presence of nitrite in an enriched nitrifying culture. The results clearly show that the elimination of SMX occurred with the presence/accumulation of nitrite, and a linear regression was observed between SMX elimination efficiency and free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration, indicating that FNA was the major factor responsible for the SMX transformation. By reacting with FNA, SMX transformation products, such as 4-nitro-SMX, desamino-SMX and hydroxylated SMX, were detected. However, when FNA concentration decreased, these intermediates may be retransformed back to SMX. These findings improved our understanding on SMX transformation in a biological system and highlighted the role of nitrite/FNA in the sulfonamide antibiotics degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biodegradation is an effective method for the removal of taste and odour (T&O) compounds from drinking water sources. In this study, the applicability of a moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) as biological treatment step for the control of MIB and geosmin was studied at pilot-scale. After a 3.5 month acclimation period both T&O compounds could be reliably removed by at least 80%. Biodegradation was found to be the dominant removal mechanism with air stripping contributing up to 25% at shorter HRTs. Also sorption of MIB and geosmin onto carriers and biofilm did occur, simultaneously facilitating the biodegradation process. The biodegradation of MIB and geosmin followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainability and resilience are both key considerations in the design and operation of wastewater systems. However, there is currently a lack of understanding of the relationship between these two goals and of the effects of increasing resilience on sustainability. This paper, therefore, presents a framework for analysis of the effects of resilience-enhancing interventions on sustainability, and applies this to an urban wastewater system. Given that sustainability addresses the long term, the framework includes a novel sustainability assessment approach which captures a continuum of potential future conditions and enables identification of tipping points where applicable. This method allows a wide range of potential futures to be captured whilst removing the need to develop scenarios or future projections. While it may be possible to develop interventions that are beneficial in terms of their effects on both resilience and sustainability, the results obtained from the case study demonstrate that implementing measures designed to increase resilience of an integrated urban wastewater system does not guarantee a universal improvement in sustainability. Therefore, when proposing measures to increase resilience, the potential effects on sustainability should be considered also. It is also shown that the extent of any negative effects on system sustainability can vary significantly depending on future conditions, with the case study intervention (increasing pump capacity) achieving the highest degree of sustainability if rainfall depths or imperviousness in the catchments reduce. However, trade-offs between sustainability indicators are present irrespective of future conditions. Furthermore, while an intervention that enhances resilience may be considered sustainable with respect to specific indicators under current conditions, tipping points exist and it will cease to be sustainable if future threat magnitudes exceed these.

AB Although measures to minimize Legionella colonization in sanitary hot water installations are well established, there is little evidence of their long-term effectiveness in hospital buildings. During an 8 year period, hot water in a large hospital building was sampled monthly in areas with suitable dimensioning and recirculation and in areas with dead legs and low-use taps. In the former areas, the percentage of Legioneffa-negative samples was 83.2% when the temperature was >= 55%, 64.9% when between 50.1 degrees C and 54.0 degrees C, and 51.6% when <= 50 degrees C (p for trend <0.001). In the highest temperature group, no samples with >= 10(3) cfu/L were observed. In poorly designed areas, only 44.7% of samples were negative, and 28.9% presented >= 10(3) cfu/L although reaching 55 degrees C. In these areas, multivariate analysis showed that if hot water supplies were not used daily, the risk of Legionella colonization was greater than two-fold (odds ratio: 2.84; 95% confidence interval: 1.26-6.41), and the risk of finding Legionella concentrations >= 10(3) cfu/L was more than three-fold (odds ratio: 3.18; 95% confidence interval: 1.36-7.46), regardless the temperature. These findings indicate that the effectiveness of maintaining sanitary hot water at a minimum temperature of 55 degrees C is significantly better than that at 50 degrees C for the environmental control of Legionella but only in installations with suitable dimensioning and recirculation. In installations that do not meet these conditions, high temperatures alone result in insufficient control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chlorprothixene (CPTX) is an antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class. Although it is widely used as a tranquillizer in psychiatry, anesthesiology, pediatrics, and in general medical practice, there is a gap in knowledge regarding its occurrence and fate in the environment. Therefore, we provide for the first-time data on the environmental fate and ecotoxicity of CPTX and its potential photo-transformations products (PTPs).
   Firstly, two standardized biodegradation tests (Closed Bottle test (CBT) and Manometric Respiratory test (MRT)) were performed to assess CPTX's environmental biodegradability. Then, its photo degradability was studied using Xenon and UV lamps. Effects of different conditions (initial drug concentration, pH, and temperature) were applied during UV-photodegradation. Subsequently, the time courses of CPTX and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were monitored throughout the photodegradation tests. After that, high-resolution mass spectrometry was employed to elucidate the structures of the formed photo-transformation products (PTPs). In addition, biodegradation tests were performed for the photolytic mixtures to assess the biodegradability of the PTPs. Finally, the (eco)toxicity assessment for CPTX and its photolytic mixtures was predicted using different (quantitative) structure activity relationship ((Q)SAR) software.
   CPTX was found to be not readily biodegradable in CBT and MRT. CPTX was not eliminated by irradiation with the Xenon lamp, however primarily eliminated using the UV-lamp. The CPTX elimination during UV-irradiation was faster at lower concentrations. CPTX UV-photodegradation was affected by pH value, while not affected by the temperature of the irradiated solution. 13 PTPs were detected in UV photolysis mixtures. One additional product was detected in CPTX standard solution, and it was degraded simultaneously with CPTX during UV-irradiation. On one hand, Biodegradation assays revealed that UV-photolytic mixtures of CPTX, containing its PTPs, were not better biodegradable than CPTX itself. On the other hand, LC-MS analysis showed some PTPs which were eliminated after the biodegradation tests indicating possible biodegradability of these PTPs. This because those PTPs are present in low concentrations in the photolysis mixture and their effect can be hindered by the effect of CPTX and other non-biodegradable PTPs. QSAR analysis revealed that CPTX and some of its PTPs may have some human and/or eco-toxic properties.
   In conclusion, the release of CPTX into aquatic environments could be harmful. Therefore, further research focusing on CPTX and its PTPs are strongly recommended. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soluble microbial products (SMPs) are the predominate foulants determining fouling extent in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). However, exact mechanism underlying their typical fouling behaviors remains unrevealed. In this study, the typical fouling behaviors of SMPs during initial operational period of a MBR were characterized. It was found that, although being low content, SMPs rather than sludge particulates preferentially adhered to membrane surface to accumulate a gel layer, and moreover, specific filtration resistance (SFR) of SMPs was approximately 700 times larger than that of the sludge particulates at operational day 3. According to energy balance principle, a unified thermodynamic mechanism underlying these fouling behaviors of SMPs was proposed. Thermodynamic analyses demonstrated that, the attractive interaction energy strength in contact between SMPs and membrane was larger by around 3700 times than that between sludge particulates and membrane, well explaining the extremely high adhesive ability of SMPs over sludge particlulates. Meanwhile, filtration through a SMPs layer was modelled and simulated as a thermodynamic process. Simulation on an agar gel showed that, about 92.6% of SFR was originated from mixing free energy change during filtration. Such a result satisfactorily interpreted the extremely high SFR of SMPs layer over sludge cake layer. The revealed thermodynamic mechanism underlying SMPs fouling behaviors significantly deepened understanding of fouling, and facilitated to development of effective fouling control strategies.

AB The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of cyclical (operated 8-12 h per day) and continuous biofilter operation with respect to biomass development, biological enzyme activity and treated water quality (in terms of organics, nutrients and disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potential). Continuously operated biofilters developed greater densities of biomass, as measured by ATP, when compared to cyclically operated filters; reducing the empty bed contact time (EBCT) increased biomass density under continuous flow conditions. However, once normalized to biomass, it was shown that cyclically operated filters exhibited higher enzyme activity, indicating that this method of operation may improve bacterial function. Reduction of organics was generally similar for both continuous and cyclical filters with the same EBCT, however, cyclical filters demonstrated higher variability during the first 4 h following start-up. Overall, HAA formation potential was better controlled by continuously operated filters, due to poor performance by the cyclical filters upon start-up while THM precursors were removed equally well by all filters. To understand the removal capacity for NDMA precursors through biological filters, both naturally occurring NDMA FP and NDMA FP resulting from spiked anthropogenic precursors was monitored through the filter depth. All the filters removed 90% of the naturally occurring NDMA FP within the first 45 cm; cyclical operation resulted in higher reduction of spiked anthropogenic NDMA precursors (50% higher than continuously operated) demonstrating the advantage of routine shut down on overall microbial activity.
   Tools to monitor and predict biofilter performance are in high demand. Here we present an "effective activity" term which combines enzyme activity with contact time (EBCT). Effective esterase activity was strongly correlated to DOC reduction as a function of filter operation (cyclical or continuous) and EBCT; effective phosphatase activity was indicative of phosphate removal. The results of this study indicate that routine shut down of the filters as this location improved enzyme activity without compromising control of chlorinated DBPs (THMs and HAAs) or NDMA derived from natural and anthropogenic precursors.

AB Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is considered challenging in the tropics, based on a great number of laboratory-based studies showing that the polyphosphate-accumulating organism (PAO) Candidatus Accumulibacter does not compete well with glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) at temperatures above 25 degrees C. Yet limited information is available on the PAO community and the metabolic capabilities in full-scale EBPR systems operating at high temperature. We studied the composition of the key functional PAO communities in three full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with high in situ EBPR activity in Singapore, their EBPR-associated carbon usage characteristics, and the relationship between carbon usage and community composition. Each plant had a signature community composed of diverse putative PAOs with multiple operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated to Ca. Accumulibacter, Tetrasphaera spp., Dechloromonas and Ca. Obscuribacter. Despite the differences in community composition, ex-situ anaerobic phosphorus (P)-release tests with 24 organic compounds from five categories (including four sugars, three alcohols, three volatile fatty acids (VFAs), eight amino acids and six other carboxylic acids) showed that a wide range of organic compounds could potentially contribute to EBPR. VFAs induced the highest P release (12.0-18.2 mg P/g MLSS for acetate with a P release-to-carbon uptake (P:C) ratio of 0.35-0.66 mol P/mol C, 9.4-18.5 mg P/g MLSS for propionate with a P:C ratio of 0.38-0.60, and 9.5-17.3 mg P/g MLSS for n-butyrate), followed by some carboxylic acids (10.1-18.1 mg P/g MLSS for pyruvate, 4.5-11.7 mg P/g MLSS for lactate and 3.7-12.4 mg P/g MLSS for fumarate) and amino acids (3.66-7.33 mg P/g MLSS for glutamate with a P:C ratio of 0.16-0.43 mol P/mol C, and 4.01-7.37 mg P/g MLSS for aspartate with a P:C ratio of 0.17-0.48 mol P/mol C). P -release profiles (induced by different carbon sources) correlated closely with PAO community composition. High micro-diversity was observed within the Ca. Accumulibacter lineage, which represented the most abundant PAOs. The total population of Ca. Accumulibacter taxa was highly correlated with P-release induced by VFAs, highlighting the latter's importance in tropical EBPR systems. There was a strong link between the relative abundance of individual Ca. Accumulibacter OTUs and the extent of P release induced by distinct carbon sources (e.g., OTU 81 and amino acids, and OTU 246 and ethanol), suggesting niche differentiation among Ca. Accumulibacter taxa. A diverse PAO community and the ability to use numerous organic compounds are considered key factors for stable EBPR in full-scale plants at elevated temperatures.

AB There is a growing move towards using the quantitative polymerase chain (qPCR)-based sewage-associated marker genes to assess surface water quality. However, a lack of understanding about the persistence of many sewage-associated markers creates uncertainty for those tasked with investigating microbial water quality. In this study, we investigated the decay of two qPCR FIB [E. coli (EC), and Enterococcus spp. (ENT) 23S rRNA genes] and four sewage-associated microbial source tracking (MST) marker genes [human Bacteroides HF183 16S rRNA, adenovirus (HAdV), and polyomavirus (HPyV), and crAssphage, a recently described bacteriophage in feces], in outdoor mesocosms containing fresh and marine waters and their corresponding sediments. Decay rates of EC 23S rRNA, ENT 23S rRNA, and HF183 16S rRNA were significantly (p < 0.05) faster than the HAdV, HPyV and crAssphage markers in water samples from all mesocosms. In general, decay rates of bacterial targets were similar in the water columns of the studied mesocosms. Similarly, decay rates of viral targets were also alike in mesocosm water columns in relation to each other. The decay rates of FIB and sewage-associated markers were significantly faster in water samples compared to sediments in all three mesocosms. In the event of resuspension, FIB and marker genes from sediments can potentially recontaminate overlying waters. Thus, care should be taken when interpreting the occurrence of FIB and sewage-associated MST markers in water, which may have originated from sediments. The differential decay of these targets may also influence health outcomes and need to be considered in risk assessment models. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Quantification of the (spatially distributed) natural contributions to the chemical signature of groundwater resources is an emerging issue in the context of competitive groundwater uses as well as water regulation and management frameworks. Here, we illustrate a geostatistically-based approach for the characterization of spatially variable Natural Background Levels (NBLs) of target chemical species in large-scale groundwater bodies yielding evaluations of local probabilities of exceedance of a given threshold concentration. The approach is exemplified by considering three selected groundwater bodies and focusing on the evaluation of NBLs of ammonium and arsenic, as detected from extensive time series of concentrations collected at monitoring boreholes. Our study is motivated by the observation that reliance on a unique NBL value as representative of the natural geochemical signature of a reservoir can mask the occurrence of localized areas linked to diverse strengths of geogenic contributions to the groundwater status. We start from the application of the typical Pre-Selection (PS) methodology to the scale of each observation borehole to identify local estimates of NBL values. The latter are subsequently subject to geostatistical analysis to obtain estimates of their spatial distribution and the associated uncertainty. A multimodel framework is employed to interpret available data. The impact of alternative variogram models on the resulting spatial distributions of NBLs is assessed through probabilistic weights based on model identification criteria. Our findings highlight that assessing possible impacts of anthropogenic activities on groundwater environments with the aim of designing targeted solutions to restore a good groundwater quality status should consider a probabilistic description of the spatial distribution of NBLs. The latter is useful to provide enhanced information upon which one can then build decision-making protocols embedding the quantification of the associated uncertainty. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sludge treatment and disposal have become critical environmental issues in China. Electro-dewatering (ED) is an attractive technology for enhancing dewaterability and improving the sustainability of waste activated sludge (WAS) handling. However, electrically assisted mechanical dewatering processes consume more energy and the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) dissolution caused by electro-chemical reactions can lead to clogging of the filter cloth. Carbon-based materials (CBMs) such as activated carbon and graphite have electrical conductivity and well-developed pore structures which can adsorb the biopolymers. Therefore, addition of CBMs is expected to improve WAS electro-dewatering performance for fuel treatment by enhancing sludge conductivity and filterability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the three carbon materials (AC-0, AC-5, and graphite) on sludge electro-dewatering behavior and the flammability of sludge cakes. The results showed that CBMs promote the performance of WAS electro-dewatering, and the promoting effect of the carbon materials on the sludge electro-dewatering is proportional to the electrical conductivity of the carbon material, and carbon materials can increase the electrophoretic mobility of sludge flocs and the electro-osmotic effect. Moreover, CBMs can adsorb the dissolved EPS, thus alleviate the plugging and filtration resistance of the filter medium. The addition of CBMs also decreases the energy consumption for water removal during the electro-dewatering process and improves the calorific value and sustainable combustion time of the sludge cake. Our approach can facilitate the resource utilization of the dewatered sludge cake in electro-dewatering processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The frequent detection of propranolol, a widely used beta-blocker, in wastewater effluents and surface waters has raised serious concern, due to its adverse effects on organisms. UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) and UV/persulfate (UV/PDS) processes are efficient in eliminating propranolol in various waters, but the formation of oxidation products in these processes, as well as the assessment of their toxicity, has not been systematically addressed. In this study, we identified and compared transformation products of propranolol produced by hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-). The electrostatic attraction enhances the reaction between SO4 center dot- and the protonated form of propranolol, while (OH)-O-center dot shows non selectivity toward both protonated and neutral propranolol species. The hydroxylation of propranolol by (OH)-O-center dot occurs at either amine moiety or naphthalene group while SO4 center dot- favors the oxidation of the electron-rich naphthalene group. Further oxidation by (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- results in ring-opening products. Bicarbonate and chloride exert no effect on propranolol degradation. The generation of CO3 center dot- and Cl-containing radicals is favorable to oxidizing naphthalene group. The acute toxicity assay of Vibrio fischeri suggests that SO4 center dot- generates more toxic products than (OH)-O-center dot, while CO3 center dot- and Cl-containing radicals produce similar toxicity as SO4 center dot-. High concentrations of bicarbonate in UV/H2O2 increase the toxicity of treated solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration has been investigated for almost 10 years. The technology is characterized not only by relatively lower transmembrane pressures which can be achieved by gravity (extremely low energy consumption), but also by the phenomenon of flux stabilization: A biofilm is allowed to form on the membrane and a stabilization of flux occurs which is related to biological processes within the biofilm layer on the membrane. This enables stable operation during a year or longer without any cleaning or flushing. Initially, the technology was developed mainly for household drinking water treatment, but in the meantime, the research and application has expanded to the treatment of greywater, rainwater, and wastewater as well as the pretreatment of seawater for desalination. This review covers the field from the rather fundamental research on biofilm morphology and microbial community analysis to the impact of feedwater composition, process parameters and organic removal performance. Not only household applications, but also for community-scale treatment and full-scale applications are discussed. In addition, the application potential is highlighted in comparison to conventional ultrafiltration. Finally, an overall assessment is illustrated and the research and development needs are identified. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Long-term (155 weeks) Pb concentrations, following partial lead service lines replacements (PLSLR), were measured in a flow through pilot made of harvested lead service lines (LSL) from the distribution system of the City of Montreal. The present study also investigates how release of Pb from full and partial LSLs is influenced by: pipe diameter, decrease in chloride-to-sulfate mass ratio (CSMR) from 0.9 to 03, addition of orthophosphate (1 mg P/L), and increase in pH to 8.3. Pb concentrations were measured after 16 h of stagnation and under flow conditions. In this study, Pb concentrations did not decrease, in the long term, after partial LSL replacement. Moreover, the most effective corrosion control treatment in full LSLs was the addition of orthoP. In contrast, the decrease of the CSMR best reduced lead release from partial LSLs. The impact of pipe configuration therefore influenced the effectiveness of corrosion control treatments. It is noteworthy that the increase in Pb concentrations following PLSLR were attributed to particulate Pb release from the galvanic section of the pipe. The occurrence of galvanic corrosion, caused by the connection between Pb and copper pipes, adds a new source of Pb in the partial LSL. At least, this new source of lead has to be offset by the removal of a long enough section of LSL during PLSLR. Full LSL replacements may be warranted to minimize the exposure of consumers to elevated Pb levels caused by galvanic corrosion in LSLs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stormwater control measures (SCMs) have the potential to mitigate negative effects of watershed development on hydrology and water quality. Stormwater regulations and scientific literature have assumed that SCMs are important sites for denitrification, the permanent removal of nitrogen, but this assumption has been informed mainly by short-term loading studies and measurements of potential rates of nitrogen cycling. Recent research concluded that SCM nitrogen removal can be dominated by plant and soil assimilation rather than by denitrification, and rates of nitrogen fixation can exceed rates of denitrification in SCM sediments, resulting in a net addition of nitrogen. Nitrogen cycling measurements from other human-impacted aquatic habitats have presented similar results, additionally suggesting that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and algal uptake could be important processes for recycling nitrogen in SCMs. Future research should directly measure a suite of nitrogen cycling processes in SCMs and reveal controlling mechanisms of individual rate processes. There is ample opportunity for research on SCM nitrogen cycling, including investigations of seasonal variation, differences between climatic regions, and trade-offs between nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal. Understanding nitrogen dynamics within SCMs will inform more efficient SCM design and management that promotes denitrification to help mitigate negative effects of urban stormwater on downstream ecosystems.

AB Membrane fouling, especially inorganic fouling due to salt crystal formation and deposition on the membrane surface, is still a major technical issue in membrane distillation (MD) applications. In this study, microbubble aeration (MBA) was included in a laboratory-scale vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) rig and its effect on a desalination process was examined. Without MBA, serious membrane scaling occurred during desalination of simulated high-salinity sea water (100 g.L-1 salt concentration), which resulted in a dramatic reduction of permeate flux to essentially zero after 120 min. Scanning electron microscopy showed that a layer of large cuboid salt crystals uniformly covered the membrane surface. However, membrane scaling was mitigated with the introduction of MBA, resulting in the improved VMD desalination performance, which was positively correlated with pump pressure in the microbubble (MB) generator. Results showed that the effective processing time of the VMD desalination processing cycle was respectively prolonged to 150, 180, and more than 300 and 360 min (cf. 120 min without MBA) when the pump pressure was respectively at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 MPa, leading to the increase of cumulative water production. Further studies found that larger numbers of MBs of smaller size were produced at higher pump pressure, which are more beneficial for increasing water vapor production and alleviating salt precipitation. The difference in zeta potential between the MBs in distilled water (about -30 mV) and that in SW100 solution (about -2 mV) demonstrated that MBA not only effectively mitigated the negative effect of concentration polarization by enhancing the surface shear rate at the membrane surface, but also reduced salt precipitation probably due to the MBs attracting counterions to the gas-water interface. Finally, energy consumption analysis of the modified VMD desalination process revealed that MBA, while itself only adding about 3% to the total energy consumption at varied pump pressures, was able to improve the specific energy consumption, especially at higher pump pressures. Together, these results demonstrate that MBA is an effective way of improving the performance of VMD desalination of water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are major sources of airborne bacteria, which could pose health risks to WWTP workers and surrounding residents. In this study, air samples were collected from various treatment facilities of a typical WWTP. Community compositions of airborne bacteria were identified by high-throughput sequencing technique. SourceTracker was used to determine the percentages of airborne bacteria from wastewater, sludge, ambient air, and other environment. Health risks associated with airborne bacteria were estimated based on the average daily dose rates (ADD) of exposure by inhalation and skin contact. Concentrations of airborne bacteria varied in a wide range of 23-4878 CFU/m(3). The main emission sources of airborne bacteria were treatment facilities with aeration, mechanical agitation, and located indoors. For treatment facilities located indoors, higher percentages of airborne bacteria were associated with wastewater and sludge, while more airborne bacteria were originated from the ambient air for outdoor installations. Opportunistic pathogens such as Micrococcus, Bacteroides, Chryseobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter, were detected in airborne bacteria. Inhalation was the main pathway for on-site workers exposure to airborne bacteria. Due to the presence of opportunistic pathogens, strict control measures should be employed in WWTPs to reduce the infection risks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concern about the presence of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment from wastewater discharge is mounting. In this work, the occurrence and fate of atenolol, metoprolol, venlafaxine, and chloramphenicol, including 10 different stereoisomers, were investigated in sewage and sludge from diverse treatment processes in 4 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Hong Kong via 4 sampling campaigns over a period of 2 years. The average amounts of individual pharmaceuticals entering the STPs ranged from 4.91 g/d to 6290 g/d, with sludge carrying much lower amounts than the discharged effluent. Mass balance analysis revealed that: larger quantities of these pharmaceuticals were released during the dry seasons, biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism for atenolol and chloramphenicol, and the removal via primary sedimentation and disinfection processes was insignificant (<30%). Selectivity toward R-(+)-atenolol, S-(-)-metoprolol, and R-(-)-venlafaxine was mostly found across secondary treated effluent samples. Sold as an enantiopure pharmaceutical in R,R-para-form, chloramphenicol was preferentially eliminated after biological process. This is the first study on the occurrence of chloramphenicol enantiomers in the aquatic environment. Ecotoxicological assessment indicated that atenolol and metoprolol could pose risks to marine fish in effluent-receiving waters (i.e., the western waters and Victoria Harbor) of Hong Kong, while R-(+)-atenolol could pose a risk to protozoans five times higher than the S-(-)-enantiomer.

AB Biological drinking water treatment technologies offer a cost-effective and sustainable approach to mitigate microcystin (MC) toxins from harmful algal blooms. To effectively engineer these systems, an improved predictive understanding of the bacteria degrading these toxins is required. This study reports an initial comparison of several unstructured kinetic models to describe MC microbial metabolism by isolated degrading populations. Experimental data was acquired from the literature describing both MC removal and cell growth kinetics when MC was utilized as the primary carbon and energy source. A novel model-data calibration approach melding global single-objective, multi-objective, and Bayesian optimization in addition to a fully Bayesian approach to model selection and hypothesis testing were applied to identify and compare parameter and predictive uncertainties associated with each model structure. The results indicated that models incorporating mechanisms of enzyme-MC saturation, affinity, and cooperative binding interactions of a theoretical single, rate limiting reaction accurately and reliably predicted MC degradation and bacterial growth kinetics. Diverse growth characteristics were observed among MC degraders, including moderate to high maximum specific growth rates, very low to substantial affinities for MC, high yield of new biomass, and varying degrees of cooperative enzyme-MC binding. Model predictions suggest that low specific growth rates and MC removal rates of degraders are expected in practice, as MC concentrations in the environment are well below saturating levels for optimal growth. Overall, this study represents an initial step towards the development of a practical and comprehensive kinetic model to describe MC biodegradation in the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A key challenge in conceptual models for contaminated sites is identification of the multiplicity of processes controlling contaminant concentrations and distribution as well as quantification of the rates at which such processes occur. Conventional protocol for calculating biodegradation rates can lead to overestimation by attributing concentration decreases to degradation alone. This study reports a novel approach of assessing in situ biodegradation rates of monochlorobenzene (MCB) and benzene in contaminated sediments. Passive diffusion samplers allowing cm-scale vertical resolution across the sediment-water interface were coupled with measurements of concentrations and stable carbon isotope signatures to identify zones of active biodegradation of both compounds. Large isotopic enrichment trends in C-13 were observed for MCB (1.9-5.7 parts per thousand), with correlated isotopic depletion in C-13 for benzene (1.0-7.0 parts per thousand), consistent with expected isotope signatures for substrate and daughter product produced by in situ biodegradation. Importantly in the uppermost sediments, benzene too showed a pronounced C-13 enrichment trend of up to 2.2 parts per thousand, providing definitive evidence for simultaneous degradation as well as production of benzene. The hydrogeological concept of representative elementary volume was applied to CSIA data for the first time and identified a critical zone of 10-15 cm with highest biodegradation potential in the sediments. Using both stable isotope-derived rate calculations and numerical modeling, we show that MCB degraded at a slower rate (0.1-1.4 yr(-1) and 0.2-3.2 yr(-1), respectively) than benzene (3.3-84.0 yr(-1)) within the most biologically active zone of the sediment, contributing to detoxification.

AB Peracetic acid (PAA) is a promising alternative to chlorine for disinfection; however, bacterial regrowth after PAA disinfection is poorly understood. This study compared the regrowth of bacteria (Gramnegative Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Gram-positive Bacillus sp.) after disinfection with PAA or free chlorine. In the absence of organic matter, PAA and free chlorine prevented the regrowth of planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa PAO1 at C.t (= disinfectant concentration x contact time) doses of (28.5 +/- 9.8) mg PAA.min.L-1 and (22.5 +/- 10.6) mg Cl-2.min.L-1, respectively, suggesting that they had comparable efficiencies in preventing the regrowth of planktonic bacteria. For comparison, the minimum Ct doses of PAA and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm cells in the absence of organic matter were (14,000 +/- 1,732) mg PAA.min.L-1 and (6,500 +/- 2,291) mg Cl-2.min.L-1, respectively. PAA was less effective than free chlorine in killing bacteria within biofilms in the absence of organic matter most likely because PAA reacts with biofilm matrix constituents slower than free chlorine. In the presence of organic matter, although the bactericidal efficiencies of both disinfectants significantly decreased, PAA was less affected due to its slower reaction with organic matter and/or slower self-decomposition. For instance, in a dilute Lysogeny broth-Miller, the minimum concentrations of PAA and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic P. aeruginosa PAO1 were 20 mg PAA.L-1 and 300 mg Cl-2.L-1, respectively. While both disinfectants are strong oxidants disrupting cell membrane, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) revealed that PAA made holes in the center of the cells, whereas free chlorine desiccated the cells. Overall, this study shows that PAA is a powerful disinfectant to prevent bacterial regrowth even in the presence of organic matter. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A harmonization of sampling, sample preparation and detection is pivotal in order to obtain comparable data on microplastics (MP) in the environment. This paper develops and proposes a suitable sampling concept for waterbodies that considers different plastic specific properties and influencing factors in the environment.
   Both artificial water including defined MP fractions and the discharge of a wastewater treatment plant were used to verify the derived sampling procedure, sample preparation and the subsequent analysis of MP using thermal extraction-desorption gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (TED-GC-MS).
   A major finding of this paper is that an application of various particle size classes greatly improves the practical handling of the sampling equipment. Size classes also enable the TED-GC-MS to provide any data on the MP size distribution, a substantial sampling property affecting both the necessary sampling volume and the optimal sampling depth.
   In the artificial water with defined MP fractions, the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 110%, depending on the different MP types and MP size classes. In the treated wastewater, we found both polyethylene and polystyrene in different size classes and quantities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays the high consumption rates of fossil fuel and pollution of unburned hydrocarbons in exhaust gases are the major problems that face the world. Using HHO dry cell is suggested for solving these problems at the engines. Experimenting with an actual HHO dry cell is more expensive, and consumes more time and effort. So modelling HHO dry cell usage is very important to save costs and efforts. Different parameters were modelled and evaluated for using HHO dry cell. The experimental tests were performed at the Faculty of Engineering, Suez Canal University on a gasoline engine (Chevrolet Lanos 1.5, model 2012). Beta cell was designed, fabricated and connected to said engine. The cell performance can easily be controlled and adjusted using different parameters. Many different factors were taken into consideration, such as; the cell design, the free space in the car engine, and the plates' overall dimensions. There is a lack in the study of modelling and simulation of hybrid spark-ignition engine using (HHO) dry cell with complete parameters. Therefore, the main objectives of this study are to perform and evaluate the modelling of different parameters that affect the performance of the hybrid spark-ignition engine. Also in this study, two different modelling techniques were used according to the available experimental data; MATLAB code and fuzzy logic modelling. The experimental and modelled results were compared and evaluated according to different statistical methods, such as the coefficient of determination (R-2). The results showed that there is strong agreement between the experimental and the modelled fuzzy data, with R-2 equaling 0.915 for the hydroxy rate.

AB Dual-injection strategy combined with dual-fuel can provide flexible and instantaneous blend ratios according to engine demands under different operating conditions. Furthermore, ethanol direct injection has the potentials to increase the engine compression ratio and thermal efficiency by taking advantages of ethanol fuel such as the high octane number and latent heat. Therefore, in order to maximize the charge cooling effect, a dual-fuel (gasoline and ethanol) dual-direct injection system is proposed and investigated in this paper. In current work, different injection modes in terms of knock suppression and combustion performance are compared and studied on a single-cylinder SI engine with stoichiometric air/fuel ratios. The results show that the new injection strategy of dual-fuel dual-direct injection mode can significantly expand engine load compared with conventional modes of gasoline direct injection plus ethanol port injection and ethanol direct injection plus gasoline port injection. Direct injection ethanol mode can reduce knocking tendency. However, with higher brake mean effective pressure, dual-fuel dual-injection mode shows higher knock tendency. Dual-fuel dual-injection mode can increase brake mean effective pressure and thermal efficiency simultaneously. However, the brake thermal efficiency behavior is non-linear when increasing brake mean effective pressure and direct injection ethanol mass fraction. The equivalent heat value brake specific fuel consumption decreases with the increase of direct injection ethanol ratio, and dual-fuel dual-injection mode has superior fuel conversion efficiency. Relatively high maximum pressure can be found in dual-fuel dual-injection mode. With the increase of ethanol ratio, the combustion phasing is further advanced, resulting in better combustion, which contributes to higher thermal efficiency.

AB Looped-tube thermoacoustic engines have shown to be operational with low temperatures. When equipped with multiple stages, preferable acoustic conditions are inherently achieved, leading to high efficiency. However, engines with only a single stage are able to achieve a similar performance, when acoustic disturbances are properly matched by implementation of an additional, acoustically effective element. Furthermore, acoustic conditions in the regenerator can be accurately tuned by adjusting the element's volume (i.e. impedance) and position in respect to the regenerator. The present work compares three different methods for acoustic field adjustment: a side-branched stub, a compliant segment and an inertial segment. The last two are widened or narrowed sections of the feedback loop, respectively. The influence of different general positions is considered. All configurations are analysed and compared with each other regarding their acoustic tuning capabilities and possible side effects to the acoustic field. As a result, superior engine performance is achieved by use of a compliant segment, closely followed by use of a stub. Furthermore, the length of a compliant or inertial segment has a major impact on performance. While extending a compliant segment slightly improves power, it can be crucial for an inertial segment. The comprehensive analysis is carried out numerically under identical conditions for each configuration. DeltaEC (Design Environment for Low-amplitude Thermoacoustic Energy Conversion) is used as simulation software.

AB Increasing electricity production by solar and wind energy is projected to impact the stability of electricity grids and consequently may limit the growth of renewable electricity generation. This issue can be ameliorated in part by increasing the flexibility of baseload power plants. A thermodynamic analysis of thermal energy storage (TES) coupled with a nuclear-powered Rankine cycle as one approach of increasing baseload flexibility is presented. During periods of excess capacity, the high-pressure steam supply is used to charge the TES. When electricity generation above the baseload capacity is required, the TES is discharged to generate steam for expansion in the low-pressure turbine. Pressure, temperature, and enthalpy state points within the cycle are presented over a range of charge and discharge rates. The capacity factor over a charge/discharge cycle is up to 9.8% higher than that of the same plant operated with steam bypass. This benefit increases with increasing charge and discharge power. With TES, the thermal-to-electrical efficiency is stable over a wide range of discharge rates. The results support future development of TES systems for baseload thermal power plants in a power grid in which renewable energy is prioritized.

AB The purpose of this study is to experimentally examine the oscillation frequencies of liquid slugs in multi-turn micro pulsating heat pipes (MPHPs) and to perform a theoretical study for better understanding of the experimental results. A series of experiments on silicon-based MPHPs with different overall lengths of 40, 50, and 60 mm are performed at different heat inputs in a bottom-heating mode. Ethanol is used as a working fluid at a filling ratio of 55%. From a spectral analysis on flow visualization data, dominant frequencies of the MPHPs are identified for each experimental condition. To theoretically estimate the dominant frequencies, a 'non-adiabatic' vapor spring liquid mass model is proposed: The spring action of a vapor plug is linked not only to a volume variation but also to a mass variation of a non-adiabatic vapor plug via phase change processes. A distinguishing feature of this model is that it is capable of handling the mass variation of a vapor plug due to phase change processes. Based on the model, a set of parameters related to the oscillation frequency is explicitly determined: the number of turns, channel length, filling ratio, liquid density, vapor pressure and specific heat ratio. A closed-form correlation of the oscillation frequency is proposed and found to be accurate in predicting the experimental data to within 15%. It is also shown that the oscillation frequency is over-predicted by more than 100% of the experimental data when the spring-mass model is used without including the mass variation due to phase change processes.

AB The direct-injection concept in gasoline engines induces emission problems due to wall impingement of fuel and lack of mixing time, compared to port-fuel-injection engines. One of the solutions for these problems is optimization of the spray pattern. In this study, injector nozzle arrangement and injection timing were optimized under the wide-open-throttle condition using computational fluid dynamics. An injection pressure of 33 MPa was utilized. Mixture homogeneity, turbulent kinetic energy, and fuel film mass were monitored to evaluate the intermediate optimal design. These variables comprise the objective function. The nozzle arrangement was restricted to consider the processability and reduce computational costs. The KIVA-3V release 2 code was combined with the optimization tool. Depending on the design, the amount of leaking along the outflow to the intake port at the end of the intake process varies, however the injection quantity was maintained for simplification of optimization process. After optimization, the vapor fuel mass fraction in the intake port was considered to form a stoichiometric mixture, and mixture formation and combustion processes were analyzed. The optimal design had a narrower pattern than the reference design and targeted the downward direction when mounted on the engine because it is easy to increase in-cylinder turbulence intensity. The optimal design showed that the mixture homogeneity increased by 0.86% based on homogeneity index and the fuel film mass decreased by 51%, while the turbulent kinetic energy showed no significant change. The exhaust emissions (carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, soot, nitrogen oxide) were reduced, while the indicated mean effective pressure remained constant.

AB Humidification-dehumidification (HDH) process has proved to be a promising technology for obtaining drinkable fresh water. Traditional HDH process exhibits limitations in steady working due to the dependence in the stability of heat and cold sources. A combination of heat pump and HDH has been proposed to solve effectively above challenge. However, the energy equalization between heat source and cold source must be guaranteed to maintain the continuing water production. A novel enhanced HDH method with weakly compressed air and internal heat recovery based on traditional mechanical vapor compression is therefore developed, in which moist air instead of vapor is used as the work fluid. Solar energy is required only for the system start-up, and cooling seawater and additional heat sources are no longer needed during steady operation stage. Meanwhile, the restrictions of evaporation and condensation temperature in the HDH process driven by heat pump can also be completely solved. It is found that the system performance can be significantly improved by increasing spraying seawater temperature. When the spraying seawater temperature is 70 degrees C, the maximum specific energy consumption and gained-out-ratio (GOR) are 18.35 kg/kWh and 12.24 respectively, and GOR is much larger than that of tradition HDH process (normally less than 6) driven by heat pump or solar energy. This new approach provides the possibility for high-efficient, steady and small-scale drinkable water production.

AB Reusing retired electric vehicle batteries (REVBs) in renewable energy systems is a relatively new concept, and the presented PV-hydrogen-REVB hybrid energy system is a promising way to exploit REVBs' residual capacities. This paper focuses on the design and sizing optimization of the entire system and delivers three main contributions. First, this paper proposes a REVS model based on the model of capacity fading of lithium battery cells, which could allow a more realistic result for the design. Second, a power management strategy is presented to regulate the energy flow, for protecting the REVS and other system components. Third, multiple objectives are considered in the optimization model, including minimizing loss of power supply, system cost, and a new indicator, namely, potential energy waste. Then, using the simulation results of a five-year working period to calculate the objective functions, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II is applied to generate the Pareto set of a case for residential usage. In further discussions, the influences of ignoring REVB's capacity fading and removing the objective of potential energy waste possibility are presented, as well as the comparison of performances between NSGA-II and MOEA/D. The results reveal that the reliability of the system is impaired if ignoring the REVB's capacity loss, and the proposed indicator is crucial for the design. NSGA-II has a better performance regarding the distribution of solutions and gives better results in this study.

TI Does hydrothermal carbonization as a biomass pretreatment reduce fuel

AB Co-firing of biomass and coal may increase short-term renewable fuel usage. However, the lower heating value and higher reactivity (at lower temperatures) of raw biomass can result in fuel segregation in boilers, causing burnout at lower temperatures, lower steam generation efficiency and fouling. In addition, the relatively high water content of some biomasses requires extensive drying prior to combustion. These issues may be addressed by hydrothermally carbonizing moist biomasses to produce hydrochars that more closely resemble coal's properties prior to co-firing. In the present work, we probe the co-oxidation behavior of a series of hydrothermally carbonized biomass samples over a range of hydrochar-coal blend ratios to determine the degree of carbonization necessary to reduce fuel segregation. However, due to the presence of an extractable amorphous secondary char, even highly carbonized hydrochars have considerably higher oxidative reactivity than a representative bituminous coal sample. When blended, the hydrochars and coal display distinct derivative thermogravimetric oxidation ranges, in which a low-temperature peak is dominated by the secondary char oxidation, followed by a high-temperature char oxidation peak of the primary solid hydrochar. After extraction of the secondary char, the primary char displays a lower reactivity than the coal. As a co-fired fuel, it appears that blending hydrochars up to 10 wt% with a bituminous coal is possible as a partial fuel substitution. To increase the percentage of hydrochars blended with coal, it may be necessary to extract this secondary char (which contains valuable biofuels and platform chemicals) before blending.

AB Nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) play an important role in algae cultivation as they are important nutrients for its growth. They also affect the conversion route, the product distribution (i.e. yield), elemental and chemical composition of the end products. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is one of the most suitable processes to convert high-moisture algae to biocrude without drying. The high protein fraction in algae species causes high N (5-8 wt%) and S (0.5-1.5 wt%) in the biocrude. In this review, only two approaches for algae biocrude upgrading for N and S removal were identified from the literature, two-stage HTL and catalytic HTL (e.g. K2CO3 and activated carbon promoted denitrogenation and desulphurization). Most published research presumed that high N content in biocrude will result in high NOx when biocrude is used in a diesel engine. However, NOx emissions are heavily dependent on engine operating conditions as well as on fuel properties and to our knowledge, no study investigated emissions of N-S containing biofuel and the consequent effect on emissions has been done, requiring further study. This review will consider cultivation and harvesting techniques, the conversion routes (especially HTL), the quality of the biofuels and the engine performance and emissions focusing on the role N and S each play.

AB The study presents an experimental investigation of a thermal energy storage vessel for load-shifting purposes. The new heat storage vessel is a plate-type heat exchanger unit with water as the working fluid and a phase change material (PCM) as the energy storage medium. The thermal characteristics of the heat exchanger such as heat transfer coefficient, effectiveness, efficiency, water exit temperature, heat storage rate, total energy storage capacity and storage time were experimentally evaluated as a function of various inlet conditions. The compact parallel plate design showed an enhanced the performance compared to conventional storage systems with an effectiveness up to 83.1% even when a PCM of low thermal conductivity is used. The proposed phase change energy storage system not only can deliver substantial benefits as a thermal energy storage medium, but also provides cost savings in infrastructure, equipment, and maintenance/operations compared to conventional systems.

AB A novel off-grid small power generation system using locally available sources is proposed in this paper for the areas, where the open-wells or the permanent sources of water are available. Although, the system can be installed anywhere, but its installation in remote and rural areas, where there is no access of electricity, can be an interesting application. The proposed system comprises of a solar photovoltaic (SPV) system, solar water pump, pico-hydro turbine-generator and pumped-hydro energy storage system. Its operation is quite different from all other existing SPV power generating systems. In this paper, an innovative power generation technique is developed, due to which the output power of the proposed system is absolutely unaffected by the changes that occur in solar irradiation. The proposed system does not require the use of batteries, inverter, transformer, and charging or controlling circuits at all. The attractive features of the system are simplicity, reliability and ability to generate continuous power at constant voltage irrespective of variations or absence of solar irradiation. The mathematical model of the proposed system has been developed in the paper. The simulation is carried out using real solar irradiation for performance evaluation of the proposed model.

AB In this paper, a low-high pressure double oil hydraulic system with accumulators was presented with the features of high working efficiency, high control precision and large working capacity. To analyze the hydraulic system energy characteristic, a novel analytical approach, based on the mathematical energy dissipation model of hydraulic components, was proposed to calculate the system energy dissipation by establishing high accuracy simulation model. A test rig with a 10,000 kN hydraulic fine blanking press was built up and used to validate the proposed system and the energy analytical approach. Finally, the system energy dissipation of the 10,000 kN hydraulic fine blanking press was analyzed and the pump output pressure was optimized to minimize the energy dissipation with the genetic algorithm. Results indicate that the energy efficiency of the hydraulic fine blanking press hydraulic system is low, and especially under low-load conditions it is (0-50% full load rate) less than 15%. About 50% of the total input energy is consumed in the form of valve dissipation resulted from the imbalance of installed and demanded energy. After optimization, the total input energy decreases by nearly 50% and the energy efficiency increases by 10%, especially under low-load conditions.

AB Nowadays, the vast majority of electricity is extracted from the steam turbine, while the non-equilibrium condensation will take place because of the high steam velocity and low superheat temperature in steam low-pressure stage, which will not only reduce the efficiency but endanger the safety of the steam turbine by corroding the blade. The aim of this work is to optimize the novel dehumidification structure to reduce the wetness loss and increase the efficiency of steam turbine. Firstly, the modified model is developed to predict the non equilibrium condensation flow. The modified model is validated in stator cascade, which shows a greater agreement with the experimental data compared with original model, especially the Wilson point and pressure rise caused by the non-equilibrium condensation. Secondly, two novel dehumidification structures are presented on the basis of my previous study, and the dehumidification effect is checked using the modified model. With the passage outlet diameter increasing in the PICS, the reduction of the outlet average liquid mass fraction and wetness loss in cascade has the same tendency, and the more the passage outlet diameter, the lower the outlet average liquid mass fraction, the less the wetness loss caused by the non-equilibrium condensation in cascade. Thirdly, compared with the original cascade, the PICS with the phi = 5 degrees having the divergence nozzle characteristic and larger outlet diameter presents the best dehumidification effect and succeeds in reducing the average liquid mass fraction and wetness loss to 3% and 3.06 kJ/kg, respectively.

AB In the quest for renewable energy sources and sustainable development, hydrokinetic energy available in marine currents, river currents, water flows and man-made canals should be harnessed. This is particularly true for rural and remote areas, which have access to water but often have poor electricity. The vertical axis current turbine, which is a key hydrokinetic technology, has been greatly improved over the last few years. It has numerous advantages, including independency of flow direction, design simplicity, quiet operation, no required yaw mechanism and low cost. The Savonius hydrokinetic turbine is one of the most important drag-type configurations of a vertical axis current turbine. However, it suffers from negative torque, negative drag force on the returning blades, low efficiency and difficulty interfacing with a generator. This paper proposes a novel drag based vertical axis current turbine using arms and self-adjusting blades. This novel design was developed based on the framework of a Savonius hydrokinetic turbine. In an effort to decrease the hydrodynamic resistance of the returning blades and increase the total output torque of the turbine, this study aims to investigate the performance characteristics of a novel vertical axis current turbine (hereinafter referred to as "self-adjusting blade turbine"). Experimental tests were conducted in the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) at low speed currents to assess the performance characteristics of three configurations of a fixed blade turbine and a self-adjusting blade turbine. The force acting on one blade of the self-adjusting turbine was analysed in detail. The results showed that the arm length and blade angle affected the performance of turbine, and that there was 30.7% increase in performance for the self-adjusting blade turbine compared to the fixed blade turbine.

AB In this paper, a methodology is developed to evaluate the performance of a solar system composed of a Stirling engine and a solar dish. There are four models to be assessed: theoretical model of solar irradiation, model of parabolic solar dish, thermal model of receiver and prediction model of Stirling engine performance. A case of study will analyse a city named Natal-RN, located in Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil. This city has high annual rates of solar irradiation. Tonatiuh software is used to evaluate parabolic dishes applying the Monte Carlo Ray Tracing method. Furthermore, a prediction model of Stirling engine performance is reformulated using 26 engines data. This reformulation allows error reduction in the prediction of four parameters when compared with the original Iwamoto's model: 40.0% in the maximum output power, 31.0% in the output power at maximum efficiency, 12.1% in the engine speed at maximum output power and 55.8% in the engine speed at maximum efficiency. The behaviour of the system, NS03T Stirling engine and solar dish, is assessed using experimental data of a Brazilian program named SONDA. At Natal-RN, it is noticed that the maximum output power reached by NS03T is higher than 1.6 kW and its global efficiency is higher than 19% between 12 h and 15 h, reaching 26% at 11 h. This values are referent to April, which is the month that represents the average solar characteristics during the year of 2015.

AB Co-pyrolysis corn stalk (CS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is an effective method to mitigate environmental pollution and reuse the problematic plastic to produce valuable energy. The devolatilization kinetics and the evolution of gaseous species during co-pyrolysis were investigated via TG-FTIR-MS. Moreover, the possible interactions of CS and HDPE were explored. The co-pyrolysis process of CS-HDPE blends was found to be divided into two decomposition stages. The first stage (150-400 degrees C) was mainly associated with the decomposition of CS. The second stage (400-515 degrees C) was the result of combinations of the thermal degradations of CS and HDPE, with the degradation of HDPE contributing the most. Co-pyrolysis CS with HDPE could delay the decomposition of HDPE. In addition, the difference between experimental and theoretical weight loss (Delta W) was found to be less than zero when the percentage of CS was 80%. Furthermore, the average of the experimental activation energy was lower than that of the theoretical value for 80% CS. Thus, the positive synergy was strongest when the CS content was 80%, based on the thermal decomposition behavior and the activation energy. However, the blending ratio of CS-HDPE had little effect on the major categories of gaseous products during co-pyrolysis. Moreover, the interaction between CS and HDPE in the first stage (150-400 degrees C) could promote the release of H-2, CO/C2H4 and C3H6 in the blends with 80%, 60%, and 60% CS, respectively. Additionally, aliphatic hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10, C4H8, C2H2) and oxygen-containing compounds (aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, acids) were suppressed by the interaction when the percentage of CS was less than 60%. In the second stage (400-850 degrees C), the yields of aliphatic hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10, C4H8, C2H2, C4H6) were inhibited, independent of the content of CS in the blends. In addition, the production of H-2, CO/C2H4, and C3H6 was promoted when the percentage of CS was below 80%, 80%, and 60%, respectively.

AB A study was carried out on the effect the evolution of the porous structure and metal content have on the gasification rate during char gasification in a conical spouted bed reactor. Partially gasified samples at different temperatures (800-900 degrees C range) were collected at various conversion levels and characterized by different techniques (N-2 adsorption-desorption, ultimate/proximate analysis and X-ray Fluorescence). At 900 degrees C there is a fast development of the porous structure, attaining the highest BET specific surface area (S-BET) (633 m(2) g(-1)) at low conversion. Char reactivity profiles revealed that the development of the porous structure influenced the reaction rate mainly at early stages, whereas the increase in the gasification rate for conversions higher than 60% (especially at 900 degrees C) was attributed to the catalytic effect of Ca, K and Fe (the main metals in the ashes).

AB In order to reduce wind curtailment, a wind-turbine coupled with a solar thermal power system to form a wind-solar hybrid system is proposed in this paper. In such a system, part or all of the curtailed wind power is turned into heat through an electric heater and stored in the thermal storage sub-system of the solar thermal power plant. To simulate and study the performance of the hybrid system, a simulation model of the hybrid system, which consists several modules/sub-models is developed. In addition, a capacity configurations optimization model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the economic performance. An 80 MWe hybrid system in Zhangbei China is selected as the study case. The result shows that when the capacity ratio of the wind power generation to solar thermal power generation, thermal energy storage system capacity, solar multiple and electric heater capacity are 1.91, 13 h, 2.9 and 6 MW, respectively, the hybrid system has the highest net present value of $27.67 M. Correspondingly, compared to the conventional coal-fired power plant, it could reduce carbon dioxide emission by 15,470 tons per year. Besides, the sensitivity of each capacity parameter on the annual performances of hybrid system is analyzed in this paper. The results show that the electric heater can effectively reduce the wind curtailment and improve the overall system stability. The results also show that the hybrid system with bigger thermal storage system capacity and smaller solar multiple has better performance in reducing wind curtailment. And when the solar multiple is constant, mean power change rate decreases with the increase of thermal storage system capacity. The bigger the solar multiple is, the faster the decrease of mean power change rate is.

AB An experiment system for CPU cooling based on nanofluids is set up. The flow and heat transfer characteristics of TiO2-water nanofluids in CPU heat sink are experimentally investigated. The influences of rectangular groove depths (1 mm, 2 mm) and cylindrical bulge arrangement modes (aligned and staggered arrangements) on thermo-hydraulic performances of CPU cooled by TiO2-water nanofluids are analyzed. In addition, the influences of nanoparticle mass fractions (0.0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%) and Reynolds numbers (472-1198) are studied. The thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency evaluation plots are developed and are applied to evaluate the thermo-hydraulic performance of nanofluids. It is found that large depth rectangular groove and staggered arrangement cylindrical bulges are beneficial to heat transfer enhancement. Nanofluids with mass fraction of 0.3% and 0.4% show the best cooling performance for rectangular grooves structure and cylindrical bulges structure respectively. CPU with rectangular grooves and cylindrical bugles shows higher exergy efficiency than that with smooth surfaces under the same pump power. The exergy efficiency is sensitive to deep grooves, aligned arrangement bulges, small Reynolds number. Nanofluids with low mass fraction (0.1%) show the highest exergy efficiency.

AB Nanofluids based on spherical gold, silver, and copper nanoparticles, nonspherical silver nanoparticles, layered graphene oxides (GO), and GO/silver hybrid structures, were synthesized to analyze their effect on the thermal behavior of direct absorption solar collectors. The thermal conductivities at room temperature of all the nanofluids were similar, with values 4% higher than pure water, meaning up to three orders of magnitude differences compared to the values expected from the Maxwell model. Photothermal conversion experiments under simulated solar radiation with 1 Sun (= 1 kW/m(2)) of intensity showed that all the spherical metal nanofluids presented up to 5 K higher temperatures and 35% increase of the efficiencies than pure water after 3000 s of irradiation. A much larger effect was seen with nonspherical silver and GO/silver hybrid particles, as these nanofluids presented around 20% higher efficiencies than pure spherical silver nanofluids. The large effect of silver morphology and the addition of GO led to further tests of these nanofluids under natural solar radiation using a parabolic dish mirror with a concentration ratio of 60. Under this high radiation, nanofluids showed up to 50 K higher temperatures and 100% increase in the efficiencies than pure water. Indeed, a boiling process after just 200 s was seen in nanofluids, while in pure water this phase change did not occur. Non-spherical silver nanofluids and GO/silver hybrid structures produced steam faster than spherical silver nanofluids. Our results confirm the relevance of the nanoparticles on the thermal conversion of nanofluids, with nonspherical silver nanofluids and GO/silver hybrid nanofluids presenting the best behaviors under low and high solar radiation.

AB A one-dimensional model of a downdraft biomass gasifier is presented to investigate the effect of operating parameters on the performance of a power plant. The approach considers the biomass fed to the reactor by employing discrete particle size distribution (DPSD) to simulate the real operational conditions of a gasification power plant (120 kW(e)/400 kW(th)). Char production (byproduct) and producer gas (PG) flow are the targets of the model; the model has been validated using data from an industrial power plant (biomass consumption, pressure drop, and PG composition) with an average relative error of 1.8%. The model achieved stable and reliable results using DPSD for 16 different particle sizes. The increase in the mean biomass particle diameter (15-60 mm) diminished the PG power (363.8-285.3 kW) and the cold gas efficiency (CGE) (63.2-54.36%) because of low particle surface/volume ratio. When biomass moisture content increased (5-25 wt%), the PG power decreased (364.14-318.75 kW) because of low gasification temperature. Moreover, when the number of driven engines was increased from 2 to 5 (electric power), the CGE decreased (68.17-59.17%) due to the low residence time of the solid and gas phases, which inhibited the gasification reactions, in the reactor.

AB A methodology was developed that assessed the techno-economic and environmental performance of a small scale microgrid located in US cities of Tucson, Lubbock and Dickinson. Providing uninterrupted power the microgrid was composed of seven components - solar photovoltaics, wind-turbines, lead acid batteries, biodiesel generators, fuel cells, electrolyzers and H-2 tanks. Firstly, detailed mathematical models that predicted the hourly energy generation for each of the components were developed and validated. Secondly, based on an electricity dispatch strategy, configurations having lowest LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) were determined using an evolutionary optimization technique - Genetic Algorithm (GA). Results for a single home microgrid were verified using an exhaustive search technique that scanned the entire design space to find the lowest LCOE configuration. The microgrid size was subsequently increased to satisfy power requirements for 10 and 50 homes and new lowest LCOE configurations were determined using GA to examine the economies of scale effect on sustain ability. The LCOEs obtained were in the range of $0.32-0.42/kWh and were also compared with similar economic analyses available in the literature. The carbon footprint (LCA GHG emissions - CO2 eq.) was extremely low and was approximately 1/10th as that of an equivalent conventional electric grid.

AB In addition to electricity generation, high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells also produce numerous high-quality waste heat, which may be further used in combined cooling, heating and power systems. In this study, a new general model of an integrated system consisting of a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell, a regenerator and an absorption cycle is proposed for waste heat recovery, where the absorption cycle can be functioned as either an absorption heat pump for heating or an absorption refrigerator for cooling. Considering various irreversible losses within the system, mathematical expressions for the equivalent power output and efficiency of the proposed system are derived, from which the general performance characteristics are revealed and the optimum criteria are given. When the absorption cycle is operated in the heat pump mode or refrigerator mode, the maximum attainable power densities for the proposed system allow 33.41% and 19.34% greater than that of the sole high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell system, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of the operating current density, operating temperature, doping level, relative humidity, heat leak and heat-transfer irreversibilities on the performance characteristics of the proposed system are discussed in detail. The results obtained in this paper may offer some theoretical help for the integration and design of such an actual system.

AB In this study, a biomass-based solid oxide fuel cell integrated with a gas turbine, a reverse osmosis desalination unit, and double-effect absorption chiller is proposed for power generation, cooling and fresh water production. Accordingly, environmental contamination of the proposed system is mitigated by capturing and recycling emitted CO2 into the gasifier. Subsequently, a parametric study is performed to analyze the proposed multi generation system from energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental impact viewpoints. In addition, considering the exergy efficiency as a performance indicant (to be maximized) and total product cost as an economic indicator (to be minimized) multi-objective optimization is implemented to ascertain the best operating conditions. The results of exergy and exergoeconomic analysis reveal that gasifier is the primary source of irreversibility with exergy destruction rate of 179.8 kW and the exergoeconomic factor of the cooling system components is lower than 20%. Multi-objective optimization results show that exergy efficiency and total product unit cost of the proposed system is 38.16% and 69.47 $/GJ, respectively at the optimum operating condition. Furthermore, scatter distribution of the effective parameters demonstrates that, the stack temperature difference, gas turbine pressure ratio and CO2 recycling ratio are the most sensitive parameters, which should be kept at their lowest value.

AB R1234yf (2,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene)/ionic liquid is a kind of environment-friendly working pair, which can overcome the disadvantages of H2O/LiBr and NH3/H2O. In this work, three new working pairs R1234yf/[HMIM] [TfO], R1234yf/[HMIM] [PF6], R1234yf/[HMIM] [BF4] were proposed and new solubility data for them were determined. Two new absorption-compression hybrid refrigeration systems were proposed to improve the cooling performances of the single-effect absorption refrigeration system using R1234yf/[HMIM][TfO], R1234yf/[HMIM] [PF6] and R1234yf/[HMIM] [BF4] as working pair. The effects of compressor position, compression ratio (r), generation temperature (T-g), evaporation temperature (T-e), condensation temperature (T-c) and absorption temperature (T-a) on the coefficient of performance (COP) and circulation ratio (f) were analyzed. Comparison result shows that the two systems can effectively improve the cooling performance of the single effect absorption refrigeration system including increasing COP, reducing the heat load of condenser and f, and enlarge the operation range of T-g, T-a, and T-e. Putting compressor between evaporator and absorber is a better choice than putting it between generator and condenser. R1234yf/[HMIM] [TfO] shows better cooling performance than R1234yf/[HMIM] [PF6] and R1234yf/[HMIM][BF4] due to its favorable thermophysical properties.

AB Experimental work was carried out to clarify the heat transfer mechanism of a pulsating heat pipe (PHP). A micro pulsating heat pipe (MPHP) with five turns was fabricated by engraving an interconnected micro-channel on a 1.1 mm thick transparent glass wafer. The engraved glass wafer and a 500 gm thick silicon wafer were anodically bonded to form a closed-loop MPHP. Ethanol was charged into the MPHP as the working fluid. The MPHP was vertically oriented with a bottom-heating mode. Using infrared (IR) thermometry, the distributions of temperature and heat flux were measured at the fluid-wall interface for the first time over the entire MPHP with high spatial and temporal resolution. High-speed flow visualization, which was synchronized to heat transfer measurements, was utilized to identify the local flow patterns corresponding to the local temperature and heat flux. The heat transfer at the fluid silicon interface in the channels could be divided into the two parts: sensible heat transfer and latent heat transfer, and quantitative analysis of the data clarified the contributions of sensible/latent heat transfer to overall heat transfer. The overall contribution of latent heat transfer was estimated to be between 66% and 74%. Latent heat transfer not only induces the oscillating flow but also contributes significantly to overall heat transfer, whereas sensible heat transfer is a byproduct of the oscillating flow.

AB A novel numerical method is proposed in order to analyze pinch point (PP) characteristics in the heat exchangers such as evaporator, condenser, regenerator, preheater and so on. The different combinations of the binary mixture and pure fluid are used as hot and cold streams. In addition, using the correlation between isobaric specific heat and temperature, an extra algorithm is presented in order to calculate the temperature of fluids like commercial oils with respect to dimensionless enthalpy. In this work after a comprehensive interpretation of the presented method, a parametric study is carried out for the selected commercial oils (e.g. Therminol-66), ammonia and water as pure fluids and ammonia-water mixture as a binary mixture. The effects of parameters like ammonia mass fraction in the solution and PP temperature difference on the PP characteristics such as PP position, mass flow ratio and average temperature difference between hot and cold streams are studied afterwards. This novel method is used for all heat transfer processes in heat exchangers including binary mixtures or pure fluid as one or even both of the hot and cold streams.

AB Dense array concentrator photovoltaic (DA-CPV) system is facing large mismatch losses due to the highly concentrated non-uniform radiation. In this paper, a novel rotational symmetry (RS) connection approach with two examples is proposed to reduce mismatch losses. The output performances of the two RS connections are compared with that of four conventional connections by using a two-stage simulation method. The results indicate that under different illumination distributions and CPV cell's series resistances, the RS connection approach can dramatically reduce power losses. The proposed dichotomic rotational symmetry (DRS) and quartered rotational symmetry (QRS) connections can significantly improve the output characteristics of DA-CPV modules. Compared with the conventional series-parallel (SP) connections, the DRS and QRS connections can improve the conversion efficiency by at most 48% and 64.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, the QRS connection exhibits smoother and P-V curves, reducing the difficulty of system's maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and improving the stability of output performance with varying Gaussian illuminations. When considering the Joule heat losses generated from the series resistance of CPV cells, the RS connections can also achieve much higher conversion efficiencies than other conventional configurations.

AB A gasoline rotary engine enriched with directly injected hydrogen could be regarded as an appealing option to improve combustion efficiency while reducing emissions. In this paper, a three-dimensional dynamic simulation model coupling with the chemical kinetic mechanisms was established using CONVERGE software and validated by the experimental data. The numerical model was implemented for evaluating the influences of varying duel spark plug locations on flow field distributions, combustion processes and major emissions formation of a gasoline rotary engine with hydrogen direct injection enrichment. Simulation results showed that, a mainstream flow field formed during the end period of the compression stoke whose direction was identical to the rotor rotating direction. The variation of trailing-spark plug location resulted in slight influence on the mean flow velocity as well as notable impact on hydrogen concentration and turbulent kinetic energy distribution. It was conducive to initial ignition when the local equivalence ratio was intensified near the duel-spark plug on the leading side of the combustion chamber. Higher hydrogen concentration near spark plugs could effectively improve the combustion intensity. The preferable combustion and emission performance were achieved when the duel-spark plug positioned symmetrically with respect to the minor axis. Compared with the scheme of the closest duel-spark plug, the peak pressure increased by 24.4% and corresponding crank position advanced by 9.2 degrees CA. Despite nitric oxides emissions increased slightly, carbon monoxide emission notably reduced by 57.6% versus the scheme of the farthest duel-spark plug. When the leading-spark plug remained constant, the trailing spark plug arranged on the major axis of cylinder wall and kept an appropriate offset from the minor axis was recommended in engineering applications.

AB This work presents an optimization model for the strategic planning to satisfy the national demands of natural gas considering unconventional extraction such as shale gas and offshore extraction and conventional ways to produce associated and non-associated natural gas using enhanced gas recovery systems, as well as importation. The model incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain trade-offs between economic, environmental and health issues. A case study from Mexico is presented to show the applicability of the proposed approach to satisfy the increasing national demand of natural gas through different extraction ways. Furthermore, in the presented study, economic, environmental and health factors were evaluated to select the best option. The economic factors consider costs associated with the production and treatment of natural gas, the used fresh water and the costs that involve the transportation of natural gas from its point of extraction to final markets. Regarding to the environmental impact, the fresh water consumption and CO2 emissions are considered. The occupational health of the involved processes in the production of natural gas is also evaluated, this because workers are continuously exposed to hazardous substances that can cause long-term damage. Results show that it is possible to decrease imports to satisfy the national demands for natural gas only with their own resources, and taking care for the economic, environmental and health issues. By maximizing PROFIT, 65.9% is satisfied through the production of shale gas and the rest is satisfied by the other extraction processes without using importation; this scenario represents a PROFIT of 1.58 x 10(10) $/y, 22.774 total MMmetric ton CO(2)e/y and 36.576 MMm(3)/y for consumed fresh water.

The excess heat in biogas upgrading cycle was recovered and fed to the Kalina cycle. The proposed system was simulated by Aspen Hysys based on the real solar data for Bushehr city. Overall, the FPCs provided 2627 kW thermal power to the Kalina cycle, where 289.5 kW electrical power was produced and delivered to the biogas upgrading process. The water scrubbing process was capable of removing the CO2 and H2S contents and provided upgraded biogas with a mass flow of 2293 kg h(-1). A comprehensive second law based thermodynamic analysis was accomplished to assess the effectiveness of the proposed cycle and the exergetic performance of the components was scrutinized and discussed thoroughly. The exergy efficiency of the proposed integrated system was found 92.36%. The highest exergy destruction was occurred in the FPCs being responsible for 73% of the whole exergy destruction. The desorption column and steam turbine had the second and third highest exergy destruction, respectively. The effects of collector's number and minimum approach temperature on the exergy efficiency, upgraded biogas production, Kalina cycle efficiency, and exergy destruction were studied and discussed as well.

AB An experimental study of the effects of hydrogen and methane proportions, Compression Ratio (CR) and equivalence ratio (empty set) on the Knock Occurrence Crank Angle (KOCA), the Combustion Duration (Delta theta(CD)) and the compression Polytropic coefficient (n) is carried out in this paper. These parameters were estimated through an alternative method that uses the average engine indicator diagram and the first derivative concept. The tests were conducted in a 2 kW Cooperative Fuel Research Engine (CFR) wherein the effect of inlet pressure on KOCA was also studied. To evaluate these effects, a factorial design of experiment and an one-factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were conducted. According to the statistical analysis the evaluated engine operating conditions significantly influence the combustion parameters; however, the analysis revealed that the inlet pressure does not influence KOCA. Moreover, validated empirical correlations to estimate KOCA, Delta theta(CD) and Critical Compression Ratio (CCR) as a function of engine operating conditions were proposed. It was demonstrated that actual Mass Fraction Burned (MFB) curves can be fitted with a = 2.8 and m = 2.4 which are the so-called efficiency and form factors of the Wiebe function, respectively. These values for hydrogen and methane mixtures are different from the values widely used for conventional fuels, i.e. a = 5.0 and m = 2.0. In the present study, the compression polytropic coefficients as a function of engine operating conditions were reported and were found to be ranging from 1.21 to 1.25.

AB The absence of accurate and stable prediction of wind speed remains a major obstacle to the rational planning, scheduling, and maintenance of wind power generation. Currently, an extensive body of methods that aim to enhance the accuracy of wind speed prediction have been proposed. However, the majority of previous studies have tended to emphasize the structural improvement of individual forecasting models without considering the validity of data preprocessing. This can result in poor forecasting accuracy due to their failure to fully capture the effective information of the wind speed data. A new approach is proposed in this paper that successfully combines a data preprocessing technique with a linear combination method. Further, a new neural network framework is employed to determine the required combination weights to ensure improved prediction performance, thereby overcoming the drawback of the low accuracy of individual prediction models. Six wind speed datasets from Penglai are regarded as expository cases to analyze the forecasting validity and stability of the developed model. It can be concluded from the experiments that the combined forecasting system outperforms the individual models and the traditional linear combination models with higher accuracy and stronger stability.

AB Accurate solar photovoltaic power forecasting can help mitigate the potential risk caused by the uncertainty of photovoltaic out power in systems with high penetration levels of solar photovoltaic generation. Weather classification based photovoltaic power forecasting modeling is an effective method to enhance its forecasting precision because photovoltaic output power strongly depends on the specific weather statuses in a given time period. However, the most intractable problems in weather classification models are the insufficiency of training dataset (especially for the extreme weather types) and the selection of applied classifiers. Given the above considerations, a generative adversarial networks and convolutional neural networks-based weather classification model is proposed in this paper. First, 33 meteorological weather types are reclassified into 10 weather types by putting several single weather types together to constitute a new weather type. Then a data-driven generative model named generative adversarial networks is employed to augment the training dataset for each weather types. Finally, the convolutional neural networks-based weather classification model was trained by the augmented dataset that consists of both original and generated solar irradiance data. In the case study, we evaluated the quality of generative adversarial networks-generated data, compared the performance of convolutional neural networks classification models with traditional machine learning classification models such as support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors algorithm, investigated the precision improvement of different classification models achieved by generative adversarial networks, and applied the weather classification models in solar irradiance forecasting. The simulation results illustrate that generative adversarial networks can generate new samples with high quality that capture the intrinsic features of the original data, but not to simply memorize the training data. Furthermore, convolutional neural networks classification models show better classification performance than traditional machine learning models. And the performance of all these classification models is indeed improved to the different extent via the generative adversarial networks-based data augment. In addition, weather classification model plays a significant role in determining the most suitable and precise day-ahead photovoltaic power forecasting model with high efficiency.

AB Biogas has been used practically as an attractive renewable energy source for various combined power plants as a recent advancement in technologies. Feasibility investigation of a modified organic Rankine cycle coupled with a gas turbine cycle fueled by biogas (60% methane + 40% carbon dioxide) as a heat source is carried out in this study. Thermodynamic and thermoeconomic analysis are employed as the most powerful tools to estimate performance and cost of the system and the results are compared with the basis coupled system. Also, to investigate how the proposed systems perform under any external disturbances, a thorough sensitivity study around the basic operating input parameters was carried out. The results of the second law analysis demonstrated that among all components and for both proposed systems, the combustion chamber had the highest value of exergy destruction rate, followed by the recovery heat exchanger. The proposed combined system could produce net output electricity of 1368 kW, resulting in the thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency and overall product cost of 41.83%, 38.91%, and 17.2 $/GJ, respectively. Moreover, it is found that the thermal and exergy efficiencies of both systems could be maximized with respect to the air compressor pressure ratio and steam turbine inlet pressure, while the overall product cost of the cycles can be minimized with air compressor pressure ratio and gas turbine inlet temperature.

AB In the present study, a novel hybrid ammonia fuel cell and battery system is conceptually developed and studied electrochemically and thermodynamically. The novel system proposes a new method to enhance the utilization of electrochemical energy. The fuel cell cathode comprises of a regenerative nickel electrode. Ammonia is utilized as fuel at the fuel cell anode. During fuel cell operation, the half-cell electrochemical reaction at the cathode regenerates the electrode. This electrode acts as the anode during battery discharge. In addition, ammonia is formed at the battery cathode electrode, which is reused as fuel at the fuel cell anode. A performance assessment of the proposed system is conducted. The reversible potentials of the fuel cell and battery systems are evaluated as 0.54 V and 0.73 V respectively. The average energy and exergy efficiencies of the fuel cell system are obtained as 54.2% and 50.9% respectively. In addition, the efficiency of the battery system is found to be 75%. To analyse the system performance with changing operating conditions and parameters, several parametric studies are conducted.

AB The off-design performance of compressed air energy storage (CAES) system is crucial when integrated with intermittent renewable energy generation due to increasing requirements for demand response and a wide range of part load operation. In this study, a computationally efficient bi-directional nozzle control strategy was developed to optimize nozzle openings of multistage radial-inflow turbines during the discharge process, which is shown to minimize the energy loss of CAES and meet the requirements for demand response control. In addition, a quasi-steady-state method was employed to simulate the part-load operation using a mean-line model for radial-inflow turbines, and thermodynamic models for the rest of CAES components. According to our analysis, the optimized bi-directional nozzle control strategy is able to improve the discharge efficiency of a multistage radial-inflow turbine by 2-7% under part-load operation (<= 50% of rated load), compared with only adjusting the nozzle opening of the first stage. We also compared nozzle control with valve throttling that is commonly used for CAES. Although there was a decrease in turbine efficiency, the proposed nozzle control strategy significantly increased discharge efficiency by 10-18% under part-load operation due to the absence of throttling losses. Our study demonstrated that the bi-directional nozzle control is an effective solution for part-load operation of CAES systems.

AB Fatty alcohol is considered as a promising clean fuel alternative to fossil fuel. In this study, we developed a facile and robust multiple enzyme complex of lipase (LIP), carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and aldehyde reductase (AHR) based on cohesin-dockerin specific interaction and E. coli-ice nucleation protein (INP) surface assembly for highly efficient conversion of triacylglycerols (TAGs) to fatty alcohols. The proximity effect, customized ratio and positional arrangement of the three enzymes were readily genetically generated. The optimized cell associated three enzyme complex gave 73% of conversion yield, and showed significantly improved stability in higher temperature, acidic/alkaline environments, polar organic solvents, high concentration of substrate, and good recyclability in successive biotransformations. The three enzyme complex provides an efficient non-natural synthetic cascade route for fatty alcohol bioproduction alternative to complex de novo biosynthesis route.

AB In the present study, a new small-scale cryogenic CO2 capture and LNG cold utilization system is investigated through the exergetic and thermoeconomic approaches. During the system operation, the condensed water is obtained as the byproduct. The power generation rate and the exergy efficiency reach their maximum points with 27.29 kW and 28.86% at the lowest air temperature and the highest relative humidity, respectively. The minimum levelized product cost is seen as 13.10 $/s at the maximum air temperature and minimum relative humidity values. The component-based assessments show that the heat exchanger, which condenses the water vapor inside, has the highest exergy destruction ratio with the average share of 52.01% while the highest levelized destruction cost is calculated for the combustion chamber with the average value of 1.21 $/s. Also, the impact of levelized component cost is found more significant than the destruction costs. To define the best trade-off point of the proposed system, the multiobjective optimization is performed by using genetic algorithm. The exergy efficiency and the levelized product cost are selected as the objective functions, and the best trade-off points is observed at the ambient temperature of 304.88 K. To better show the advantage of the proposed design in the real environment, a Singapore case study is conducted, and the highest exergetic efficiency and CO2 capture ratio are seen in December with 3.84 and 25.70%, respectively. On the other hand, the levelized product cost presents its minimum value in May with 14.96 $/s whereas the condensed water rate has the highest rate in May as well.

AB This paper aimed to study the effects of spark timing and methanol addition on the combustion characteristics and emissions of a natural gas/methanol dual-fuel engine. The engine speed is maintained at 1600 rpm and the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) is maintained at 0.387 MPa with an excess air/fuel ratio of 1.3. The methanol energy substitution ratio (MSR) is set to 0%, 7.5%, and 14.5%. The spark timings are varied from 18 degrees CA to 38 degrees CA before the top dead centre, in intervals of 4 degrees CA. The results demonstrate that for a specific spark timing, the methanol addition increases the peak cylinder pressure, the maximum of the heat release rate, and the peak cylinder mean temperature. Concurrently, it decreases the flame development period (CA(0-10)) and the flame propagation period (CA(10-90)) with an increase in the MSR. An improvement in the brake thermal efficiency (BTE), a reduction in the total hydrocarbon (THC) emission, and an increase in the nitrogen oxide (NOX) emission are achieved using methanol enrichment. In addition, the effect of these trends is more pronounced with an increase in MSR. In contrast, for a specific MSR, a spark timing advance increases the peak cylinder pressure and temperature, while decreasing the exhaust temperature under an identical BMEP. Moreover, the spark timing at the maximum BTE retards as MSR increases.

AB The manufacturing sector has been one of the most significant energy consuming and CO2 emitting sectors over the past three decades. Therefore, it is important to have energy flow models of manufacturing processes to identify efficiency improvement and waste heat recovery opportunities with very specific targets. One of the best methods to pinpoint such locations is by referring to manufacturing process step models. Such models can be created on a large scale per industry and on small scale per process within an industry branch. Industry level modeling provides energy saving contingency by large magnitude where the impact on the economy and environment can be observed more visibly especially when sequential trends are identified. The methodology, reviewed in this paper, describes how to model energy flows on an industry scale by deriving the connection between key energy conversion activities on the one hand - including energy purchased/sold and onsite electricity generated, and the key end uses on the other hand. Industry-level energy flow model, referred to in this work, does not assume any specific system. That feature makes it scalable and allows analysis of manufacturing at various levels starting with single processes and finishing at sector and national economy levels. A combined analysis of the procedure is described in detail for creating process step models of manufacturing processes. The availability of U.S. national databases to calibrate these models is discussed and the challenges that arise in finding and using such databases are identified and analysed. In addition to addressing generic data issues associated with energy flow models, the paper also focuses on energy and material models and presents several examples of energy-intensive manufacturing processes, producing industrial gases, textiles, pulp and paper. Finally, importance of water use in onsite energy conversion and process end uses in various industries is addressed along with the sources of where this important data can be found to complete the energy flow modeling.

AB In this work, sulphonated carbon-based solid acid catalysts were synthesized using two types of biomass sources, which were palm kernel shell and bamboo. Both carbon precursor contained different lignocellulosic composition that eventually determined the catalyst backbone structure. The sulfonate (-SO3H) group was attached on the surface of catalyst by sulfonation process of carbon source with the chlorosulfonic acid (CISO3H) under 70 degrees C for 4 h. The resultant catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (TPD-NH3). Both sulfonated PKS (PKS-SO3H) and Bamboo (Bamboo-SO3H) catalysts were found to have high total amount of acidity about 14.4 mmol g(-1) and 8.9 mmol g(-1) which were expected to have high catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the acid value of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and percentage reduction of FFA were calculated based on standard AOCS method (Cd 3d-63). The catalytic activity of PKS-SO3H and Bamboo-SO3H demonstrated higher conversion of PFAD to biodiesel under the following reaction condition: catalyst loading of 4 wt%, methanol-to-PFAD molar ratio of 15:1, reaction temperature of 65 degrees C and the reaction time was 1 h. The PKS-SO3H catalyst managed to produce the highest FAME yield and FFA conversion which is 95% and 97%, respectively. Meanwhile Bamboo-SO3H shows slightly lower FAME yield and FFA conversion of 94.2% and 95.8%, respectively. The prepared catalysts showing the ability to recycle up to 4 times. In conclusion, the catalyst-derived palm kernel shell and bamboo had high potentials to esterify high FFA feedstocks and will be a significant finding to lower the biodiesel production's cost.

AB Borehole Heat Exchanger is one of the main elements of Ground-Coupled Heat Pump and its performance is directly related to the heat pump Coefficient of Performance. In this paper, a comprehensive numerical simulation model was built to evaluate the annual performance of the shallow Borehole Heat Exchanger installed in different soils subjected to land surface seasonal hydrothermal variations. It was found that the shallow Borehole Heat Exchanger installed in sand had a better performance of 8% than in clay. The same performance difference between sand and clay was observed in most of the investigated scenarios. The annual average heat pump performance presented a variation more than 27.2% with the meteorological condition, the grout thermal conductivity and the heat load level. The multi-pipe solution and the carrying fluid velocity also influenced the heat pump performance, ranging between 12.2 and 16.2%. Other factors such as the hydraulic condition, the groundwater flow, the grout volumetric heat capacity, the grout diameter, the shank spacing, the pipe inner diameter, the pipe thickness, the pipe thermal conductivity, the carrying fluid material and the heat load mode had less impact on the heat pump Coefficient of Performance, varying between 0 and 11.6%. These findings could be used as a guideline for the future studies of Borehole Heat Exchanger, especially for the applications installed in unsaturated soils.

AB This article investigates the gasification of Solid Recovered Fuels (SRFs). To better understand the influence of SRF composition on gasification efficiency and syngas quality, two industrial SRFs having different compositions were studied. A detailed SRF characterization was performed (elemental analysis; ash composition; LHV; fraction of biomass, non-biomass, and inert materials) to precisely describe the chemical complexity of such materials. The gasification tests were performed at pilot-scale in a bubbling fluidized bed using air as gasifying agent, and olivine as bed material. The separate contribution of gasification temperature (T = 750-900 degrees C) and equivalence ratio (ER = 0.21-0.35) on the gasification efficiency was investigated by sequentially varying these two parameters.
   Gasification tests revealed that the LHV of the syngas and the cold gas efficiency decreased by 45-50% and by 20-30%, respectively, with rising equivalence ratio. These evolutions were attributed to syngas oxidation reactions which promoted the formation of CO2. Indeed, mass balances calculation revealed that the part of carbon atoms in syngas in the form of CO2 rises from 43 to 54% for SRF1, and from 35 to 50% for SRF2. High plastic content in SRF2 was responsible for the formation of stable light hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H4 and C6H6) from the decomposition of the plastic polymer chains, and to lower amount of H-2 compared to syngas from biomass-rich SAF1. The carbon conversion decreased by 8% with rising ER from 0.21 to 0.30 for SRF2, as a result of plastics biomass interactions promoting secondary reactions and leading to char formation. For both SRFs, rising temperature significantly improved the gasification efficiency whatever the SRF composition, and decreased the CO2 concentration. These evolutions were attributed to the promotion of several reactions, such as gasification, steam and dry reforming, Boudouard reaction, and Reverse Water-Gas Shift reaction.

AB The objective of the present investigation is to develop and evaluate economic production of biofuels (ethanol) using immobilized yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCIM 3095) from renewable carbon source Madhuca indica (Mahua flowers). The entrapment of yeast cells in calcium alginate-polyvinyl alcohol (CA-PVA) film were found most suitable immobilizing matrix as a protective carrier to increase the stability and tolerance limit during continuous fermentation. Under similar fermentation conditions, immobilized yeast cells produced higher ethanol yield (similar to 0.48 g/g) and productivity (similar to 28 g/L/h) as compared to traditional suspended free cells system in continuous fermentation with dilution rate of 0.4/h. Further, the fermenter was coupled with solar driven membrane distillation (SDMD) process for separation and concentration of ethanol after fermentation. The new system does not require centrifugation/microfiltration for separation and/or recycle of biomass as the cells were immobilized and could be easily separated by simple filtration. The SDMD with cross flow module in rectangular shape and counter-current flow of streams (hot and cold) ensured higher ethanol flux (23 kg EtOH/m(2)/24 h) in comparison to existing literature. The new process design is compact yet flexible, eco-friendly, energy intensive and sustainable process for the development of economic biofuel production.

AB With the large-scale use of intermittent renewable energy worldwide, such as wind energy and solar energy, energy storage systems are urgently needed and have been rapidly developed. Technologies of compressed gas energy storage (CGES) and liquefied gas energy storage (LGES) are playing an important role, and air has been commonly used as working fluid. CO2 is another potential working fluid and attracting more and more attention due to the rise of CO2 capture and utilization. However, it is still unclear which is the better working fluid. This paper comparatively analyzed the performance of CGES and LGES systems using air and CO2 as working fluids. Both diabatic and adiabatic CGES are considered. Simulation results show that except diabatic CGES systems, using CO2 could achieve a similar or even higher round-trip efficiency than using air. In addition, the use of CO2 instead of air as a working fluid has additional advantages, such as a lower storage temperature can be achieved at the same storage pressure for the adiabatic CGES system; and a higher condensing temperature can be achieved at the same condensing pressure for the LGES system, which can benefit the system design and operation.

AB The new complex selection strategy of low energy ventilating or air conditioning system (HVAC system) from a holistic perspective is presented in the paper. The strategy carries out the solution of the whole optimization problem that consists of the HVAC system model, optimization model and optimization procedure. The practical function is the starting point of the optimization problem, whereas the energy optimal variant of the HVAC system is the final stage. Universal sets of constant parameters, decision variables and limiting conditions of the HVAC system were formulated for the mathematical description of the problem. In optimization procedure, the sets of all variants and permissible variants of the HVAC system were defined based on the system analysis with the use of matrix calculation. The objective function was determined by the use of the simulation model of the HVAC system where the algorithms of energy optimal control is determined by dynamic optimization.

AB In order to improve wind energy harvesting performance, this paper proposes a novel high-performance piezoelectric wind energy harvester with Y-shaped attachments on the bluff body (GPEH-Y). When Y-shaped attachments are removed from the bluff body, the vortex-induced vibration piezoelectric energy harvester (VIVPEH) will be obtained. The Lattice-Boltzmann CFD method (LBM) used to analyze the vibration amplitude and frequency, confirms the transition from vortex induced vibration to galloping. The transition from vortex induced vibrations into galloping by adding Y-shaped attachments to the bluff body is further verified by experiments. A theoretical model of the GPEH-Y is presented to analyze its energy harvesting performance. A set of the wind tunnel tests is conducted to validate the presented GPEH-Y. The performance of piezoelectric wind energy harvesters with or without Y-shaped attachments is specifically compared, taking into the fact that the proposed design allows a simple conversion from the VIVPEH to the GPEH layout.

AB The goal of this study is the experimental and numerical investigation of using pulsating heat pipes (PHPs) as substitutes for fins in a typical air-cooled heat exchanger. Due to the small temperature difference between the cooling air and internal airflow in the case study, it was necessary that appropriate PHPs with the capability to work in small temperature difference conditions be investigated and an appropriate working fluid be selected. After reviewing various studies, R134a was selected as the best working fluid from the heat transfer standpoint. Afterward, a testing device was designed and fabricated. Additionally, in order to predict the behaviors of the main tubes with pulsating heat pipes and also finned tubes, the computational fluid dynamics was used and pulsating heat pipes and fins were simulated and compared. Different tests were performed with various air flow rates and temperatures. The results indicated that using pulsating heat pipes as fins have a significant effect on improving the heat transfer. In free convection (without external flow over the tubes), using the heat pipes resulted in a better performance in comparison to fins and in the best case, the overall heat transfer coefficient was improved by 310%. This improvement was approximately 263% for the forced convection condition.

AB In this study, the chassis dynamometer tests for a gasoline-powered passenger vehicle were carried out under cold start and warm-up NEDC. The operating states, combustion and performance parameters of engine were measured continuously during vehicle driving cycles. Then, the combustion and thermodynamics processes under cold start and warm-up NEDC were compared and the influence factors for their differences were revealed. Results show that, since valve timing of tested engine is almost the same under cold start and warm-up conditions, it is not the main influence factor for the differences of in-cylinder RGF and EER. Although in-cylinder RGF decreases during cold start NEDC, the gap is too small to make any difference. Only in the early stage of NEDC, cold start has an obvious influence on in-cylinder combustion and thermodynamics processes of engine. For example, sparking timing is retarded, and SOC as well as 50% combustion position is further retarded. However, the heat transfer loss is also reduced due to the lower combustion temperature, thus the influence of later sparking timing on the indicated thermal efficiency of engine is restricted to some extent under cold start condition. All these provide theoretical guidance for improving engine actual performance.

AB The implementation of bulk energy storage (BES) technologies can help to achieve higher penetration and utilization of variable renewable energy technologies (e.g., wind and solar), but it can also alter the dispatch order in regional electricity systems in other ways. These changes to the dispatch order affect the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is emitted to the atmosphere and the amount of total water that is required by the electricity generating facilities. In a case study of the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas system, we separately investigated the value that three BES technologies (CO2-Geothermal Bulk Energy Storage, Compressed Air Energy Storage, Pumped Hydro Energy Storage) could have for reducing system-wide CO2 emissions and water requirements. In addition to increasing the utilization of wind power capacity, the dispatch of BES also led to an increase in the utilization of natural gas power capacity and of coal power capacity, and a decrease in the utilization of nuclear power capacity, depending on the character of the net load, the CO2 price, the water price, and the BES technology. These changes to the dispatch order provided positive value (e.g., increase in natural gas generally reduced CO2 emissions; decrease in nuclear utilization always decreased water requirements) or negative value (e.g., increase in coal sometimes increased CO2 emissions; increase in natural gas sometimes increased water requirements) to the regional electricity system. We also found that these values to the system can be greater than the cost of operating the BES facility. At present, there are mechanisms to compensate BES facilities for ancillary grid services, and our results suggest that similar mechanisms could be enacted to compensate BES facilities for their contribution to the environmental sustainability of the system.

AB Accurate estimation of soil hydraulic parameters is essential for modeling of water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soil. Ensemble-based methods have been proposed to provide the optimal monitoring (data-collection) strategy to improve hydraulic parameter estimation. To guarantee the performance, however, these methods usually require relatively large ensemble sizes, leading to high computational cost. To this end, we develop an efficient sequential probabilistic collocation-based optimal design (SPCOD) method, which integrates the adaptive ANOVA (analysis of variance)-based probabilistic collocation-based Kalman filter with the sequential optimal design. At the forecast step, the probabilistic collocation method is used to construct a reducedorder surrogate for system model with the adaptive ANOVA-based polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). At the design step, an information metric in the PCE form is derived to evaluate candidate monitoring strategies. The one with the maximum expected information metric value is chosen as the optimal. At the analysis step, the PCE coefficients are sequentially updated by a square-root Kalman filter with the real-time measurements obtained from the optimal monitoring strategy. Two synthetic numerical cases involving water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone are employed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that: (1) compared with conventional fixed monitoring strategies, the optimal monitoring strategy designed by SPCOD provides more accurate parameter estimation and state prediction; (2) compared with our previously developed sequential ensemble-based optimal design method (Man et al., 2016b), the new approach provides a more robust and accurate optimal monitoring design with nearly the same computational cost.

AB Piano key weirs (PKWs) are acquired and developed for free surface control structures which improve their performance by increasing the storage capacity and flood evacuation. In this study, the potential combinations of two popular artificial intelligence data-driven models (Al-DDMs) of multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with four meta-heuristic optimization algorithms (particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, firefly algorithm & moth-flame optimization) are assessed for predicting the PKW's flow rate. Comparing the outcomes of the ten standard and hybrid Al-DDMs with three empirical relations based on several statistics and diagnostic analysis (such as the Taylor diagram) for estimating the flow rate shows that the AI-DDMs can predict the passing flow more accurately. In addition, the particle swarm optimization and firefly algorithm meta-heuristic algorithms improve the performance of ANFIS and MLPNN, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test for investigating the differences between two independent applied models indicates a significant difference between the Al-DDMs and two of the empirical relations at the 95% confidence level.

AB High-frequency water quality monitoring is increasingly used in examining the nutrient fluxes within catchments. Despite this, no studies have assessed the impact of monitoring frequency on the uncertainty of nitrate estimates obtained from distributed or semi-distributed catchment models. This study aims to evaluate the impacts of two different frequencies of nitrate sampling on the performance of a catchment hydrology model, including the uncertainty in both predictions and calibrated parameters. The investigation uses the HYPE model to simulate streamflow and nitrate concentrations (2010-2015) in the Selke catchment, a heterogeneous mesoscale catchment in central Germany. The Bayesian inference scheme of the DREAM code was employed for calibration and uncertainty analysis, and to explore differences between fortnightly and daily nitrate sampling strategies. The results indicate that: (a) the posterior uncertainty intervals of nitrogen-export process parameters were narrower when the model was calibrated to daily nitrate measurements, while similar maximum likelihood parameter values were obtained regardless of the sampling frequency; (b) the model calibrated using daily nitrate data better represented both daily and fortnightly nitrate measurements relative to that obtained using fortnightly sampling; (c) the daily nitrate dataset produced significantly smaller parametric prediction uncertainty, but only modest reduction in total prediction uncertainty, relative to the fortnightly nitrate dataset; (d) model structural error and measurement errors are the primary sources of total prediction uncertainty, and these combine to inhibit the benefits of high-frequency monitoring. We conclude that the adequacy of sampling frequency is dependent on model structure and measurement errors, such that higher-frequency nitrate monitoring may not markedly reduce the uncertainty of nutrient predictions, depending on other levels and sources of uncertainty.

AB The time that rainfall takes to reach the outlet of a catchment as discharge (transit time) is a fundamental and integrated measure of catchment hydrological processes and solute transport mechanisms. As such, many efforts have been dedicated to its understanding and quantification. However, defining and ranking which factors, internal and external to the system, control the distributions of transit time is still an open challenge. Here, we develop a two-stage approach to explore climate and topography controls on transit time, using a fully distributed hydrological model coupled with a transport component. Specifically, we apply the model to two synthetic topographies under five observed climate regimes. With this setup, water fluxes from two years of daily rainfall events are singularly tracked across the catchments to then derive the distributions of transit time and fraction of young water for each combination of topography and climate. Results highlight a considerable variability of transit times in all climates and a pronounced effect of topography within a given climate. They further reveal that for wet climates it is possible to define a curve describing water transit time as a function of cumulative discharge that only depends on topographic properties. On the contrary, in dry climates the variability of transit time and young water fraction is much larger and not amenable to a simple summary. Despite simplifications, quantitative model-based inferences of transit time distributions are useful to better understand how climate and topography affect catchment functioning.

AB Reducing agricultural runoff year-round is important, in particular during snowmelt events on landscapes that receive wintertime applications of manure. To help inform manure guidelines, process-level data are needed that link management scenarios with the complexity of snowmelt, hence runoff. Albedo and radiative energy fluxes are strong drivers of thaw, but applying these mechanistic measurements across multiple, plot-scale management treatments over time presents a logistical challenge. The objective of this study was to first develop a practical field approach to estimate winter albedo in plot-scale field research with multiple management scenarios. The second objective was to quantify the radiative drivers of snowmelt by measuring fluxes after wintertime liquid manure application. Six management treatments were tested in south-central Wisconsin during the winters of 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 with a complete factorial design: three manure application timings (early December, late January, and unmanured) and two tillage treatments (conventional tillage versus notillage). A multiple linear regression model was developed to estimate albedo with digital imagery and readily-obtained site characteristics. Manure timing had a significant effect on radiative energy fluxes and tillage was secondary. January applications of liquid manure produced an immediate and lasting decrease in albedo, which resulted in greater net radiation absorbed by snowpack and subsequent energy available for snowmelt. Later applications of liquid manure accelerated snowmelt, which increased runoff losses and posed a challenge for nutrient retention from the liquid manure during thaw.

AB Colloid transport through complex and dynamic (i.e. non-steady-state) hydrologic systems is rarely studied, owing to the difficulty of constraining initial and boundary conditions and quantifying colloid-porous media and colloid-colloid interactions in transient flow systems. Here we present a particle tracer experiment conducted on a sloped lysimeter receiving periodic rainfall events for 10 days. Four unique, DNA-labelled particle tracers were injected both in sequence and in parallel, together with a conservative tracer (deuterium), over the course of the first day and allowed to move through the system. Discharge-particle tracer concentration curves and the spatial distribution of particle tracer mass retained in the soil at the end of the experiment were found to be highly dependent on the timing of the tracer injection and the precipitation input and subsequent dynamic response of the water table. Overall, neglecting the total DLT recovery rate, the DLT particle tracer breakthrough trend (DNA-labelled particle tracer 4) was similar to deuterium and decreased over time with the exception of a few peaks later in the experiment. The individual particle tracer breakthrough curves suggest a complex system with different fast transport mechanisms (e.g. capillary barrier and size exclusion effect) and slow retention-release mechanisms (e.g. straining, physical-chemical adsorption), which resulted in particle tracers transferring faster than deuterium in the first 10 h of the experiment but being exceeded by deuterium soon after deuterium started to break through. The experiment not only highlights the interaction of repeated colloidal pollution events in hydrologic systems with different pre-event saturation conditions, but also the benefits of using multiple synchronous or sequential tracer applications to dissect explicit formulations of water flow and colloid transport processes in complex and dynamic hydrological systems. Such explicit process formulations could help improve understanding hydrologically-controlled transport through catchments and the quantitative prediction of these processes with water quality models.

AB The chemistry of precipitations and stream waters in the critical zone of a small granitic catchment mainly covered by grassland has been investigated backward (period 1990-1997). Major elements concentrations, fluxes and budgets at annual and seasonal scales allowed evaluating the catchment response to variation trends in atmospheric deposition and hydrological patterns. Acid precipitation was efficiently buffered by soil cations exchange and mineral weathering processes, as attested by the dominance of Ca and HCO3 in stream waters. A decrease of sulfate acidity in precipitation following clean air measures was accompanied by an increase of alkalinity and a decrease of sulfate in stream waters. Waters of short residence time from water-saturated areas in the valley bottom and rapid shallow circulations within slopes were a very effective diluted weathering end-member contributing to stream outlet in high flow conditions, whereas evapotranspiration from saturated areas and/or deep waters with long residence time influenced the stream water concentration pattern in low flow conditions.
   Water discharge controlled the variations of the annual and seasonal budgets of major elements, except for nitrate and sulfate, mainly stored during summer. Soil legacy sulfate was mainly released during the first autumn stormflows, with high peak concentrations decreasing rapidly from 1990 to 1992 and disappearing afterwards. The output water flux was the main driver of the weathering rate in the acidification recovery period 1993-97, contrary to the first period 1990-92 when acidification was still under way, as attested by the weathering plateau (constant Si/Sigma BC ratio). At that time, the intense weathering testifies the disturbance caused by acidification process. However, this critical zone was resilient enough to allow rapid and significant recovery over a few years following sulfur atmospheric abatement. For the future, the atmospheric nitrogen deposition pressure remains still challenging in a global change context, which argues for the necessity of long-term observatories.

AB The groundwater tracers, deuterium ( H-2 or D) and oxygen-18 (O-18) are widely used to determine groundwater recharge origin, rate and temperature. Quantitative methods able to interpret delta D and delta O-1(8) mobility in the subsurface, especially under high pressure and temperature conditions, remain the focus of ongoing research. Here we developed an isotope transport module as an add-on to the TOUGH2 simulator, which is able to describe the evolution of delta D and delta O-1(8) in groundwater induced by advection, dispersion, water-rock interaction, and fractionation due to changes of water phase and density. The new model was tested by modelling the groundwater flow, temperature, fluid density and isotopic composition in a faulted, geothermal system in the Guide Basin, China. We found that the density-driven flow induced by temperature variations can lead to isotope fractionation between low- and high-density water. In addition, the density-driven flow creates multiple flow systems in the fault damage zone, increasing the complexity of the spatiotemporal isotope distribution. The results indicate that in scenarios where a density contrast occurs, such as in geothermal systems, the relationship between delta D and delta O-1(8) in recharge water and discharging groundwater can only be fully understood if the coupled processes of fluid flow, heat transport and isotope fractionation in the subsurface are accounted for.

AB Water quality and quantity data are essential for water resources management, but historical records are not always available at sites where information is required, especially for water quality (WQ) data because of the high costs of implementing and operating water quality monitoring networks. This leads to the impossibility/impracticality of monitoring all streams/watersheds in a region under monitoring. A novel statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of WQ characteristics (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) at ungauged streams/watersheds. The proposed approach is based on developing a WQ causes-effects functional relationship, which has not been done before. The WQ causes are represented by the watershed physiographic (natural and anthropogenic) attributes and the effects are represented by the WQ characteristics. For a target ungauged stream/watershed: (i) a canonical correlation analysis-based-neighborhood approach was applied to identify homogeneous gauged watersheds; and (ii) nonlinear regression models were then calibrated using data available at the selected gauged watersheds to develop the causes-effects functional relationship between the physiographic attributes as predictors, and WQ characteristics as dependent variables. Once the regression models were validated, the physiographic characteristics of the target ungauged stream/watershed were used to estimate its WQ characteristics. The jack-knife validation method was applied to evaluate the proposed statistical approach using 50 gauged streams from the Nile-Delta of Egypt. Results showed accurate and precise estimation of the Electric Conductivity and Sodium percentiles. For Iron, relatively less precision was obtained due to the absence of attributes that can describe the Iron concentrations.

AB Over the past decades, a new aquifer test technology (sequential pumping tests or hydraulic tomography, HT) has been developed and successfully applied to many field sites to delineate the spatial distributions of hydraulic properties (e.g., transmissivity (7) and storage coefficient (5)). Yet, the reproducibility of its estimated T and S fields and the predictive capabilities of the estimates for different flow scenarios at different time periods remain unexplored. That is to say, if the estimated fields based on sequential pumping tests conducted during different years are the same since the geologic formation and processes may have undergone changes. In order to answer this important question, this study first compares the drawdown-time behaviors from the sequential pumping tests (SPTs) conducted in 2010 with those conducted in 2012 at a field site and then finds they are similar but different in detail. It then uses these data to estimate the T and S fields and checks the reproducibility of the estimates. The estimated heterogeneity patterns are found to be generally reproducible in spite of uncertainties. In addition, the estimates from each year are capable of predicting the observed drawdowns, induced by independent pumping tests during the corresponding year (i.e., self-validation). Moreover, the estimated fields are cross-validated. That is, this study uses the estimates obtained from the 2010 pumping tests to predict the observed drawdowns of the independent pumping tests conducted in 2012. Likewise, it uses the estimates from 2012 pumping tests to forecast the drawdowns of the independent pumping tests of 2010. The results of both self-validation and cross-validation indicate that the estimated T and S fields based on the test in one year can be used to predict bulk flow behavior in the other year. Differences in detailed behaviors may be attributed to changes in the processes, omitted in the depth-averaged flow model.

AB The hydrometeorological information is shown in the form of intensity, duration and period of return of extreme rains, in order to characterize the pluviometric regime in Haiti. Using information from health services in Haiti a Meteo-Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (MEVI) is proposed. This index uses infectious-contagious disease data, the capacity and distribution of medical infrastructure, physiographic conditions of the country, and rainfall data (expressed in intensities, durations and frequency). The results show how mortality and morbidity rates are influenced mainly by communicable diseases in different risk areas. It is concluded that the territorial vulnerability exposed to hydrometeorological phenomena increases in the West and South Departments, where there is a high prevalence of diseases that exceeds the capacity of medical attention. With these results, two resilience indexes are proposed. A theoretical index (TRF) based on the conditions of the region, taking into account vulnerability (V), MEVI, resistance (RT) and homeostasis (HO). And another index of resilience measured in situ (RF). The comparison of both indices allows us to know the future capacity of the region to face the activities of resilience.

AB Flood risk mapping and modeling is important to prevent urban flood damage. In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available.

AB The objective of this study was to advance a new method to dynamically analyze the water environmental capacity (WEC) of non-point source (NPS) pollution. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and differential evolution (DE) algorithm were coupled to automatically provide a calculation of the WEC in a daily step. The results showed that the largest ideal WECs occurred in the wet season with values up to 4500 t and 80 t for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), respectively. The ideal WEC had a positive correlation with the rainfall intensity, while the opposite was true for actual WEC. The smallest value of actual WEC for TN was -150 tin June, and a negative value also occurred in June for TP. This is because NPS pollution discharge was more sensitive to rainfall and flow change than the ideal WEC. Compared to phosphorus, the WEC of nitrogen was more affected by the hydrological and NPS pollution discharge conditions. In addition, the WEC of nitrogen and phosphorus in organic species was more affected by seasonal change than that of nitrogen and phosphorus in inorganic species. Spatially, the channels in the middle and southeast of the study area had the smallest actual WEC and even negative values were observed. The results of remnant WEC showed that the smallest value occurred in July and June with values of - 800 t and -140 t for TN and TP, respectively. Thus, significant attention should be paid to controlling NPS pollution during the wet season, and organic nitrogen and phosphorus should be set as the priority pollutants to control. Furthermore, controlling the NPS pollution discharge and enhancing the WEC should be carried out simultaneously. Compared to previously used methods, the calculation method employed in this study had the ability to simulate the transformation and interaction between nitrogen and phosphorus in organic and inorganic species, and better considered dynamic changes in the input conditions.

AB The Uluova basin aquifer system (UBAS), comprised of fractured/karstic rock and multilayer basin-fill aquifers, provides water for both domestic and agricultural needs in the Elazig province (Eastern Turkey). Although, the UBAS has been subject of large-scale hydrological modifications and controversial water management practices since late 1950s, thus far no studies have examined basinwide implications of such human perturbations in an integrated manner. In this study, GIS, geostatistics, R-mode factor analysis (R-mFA) and geochemical modeling techniques were employed to unravel the factors controlling the distribution and sources of arsenic (As) and selected potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the stream sediment-soil and groundwater-surface water systems of the UBAS. As revealed by the results from R-mFA, three geogenic factors (Fl: Clay minerals and Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, F2: Weathering of parent materials, and F3: Sulfide oxidation in mineralized zones) govern the geochemical dynamics of the PTEs in the stream sediment/soil media. In stream sediment and soil samples, especially Ni, Cr, and Co presented significant enrichment relative to upper continental crust average composition, whereas As contents were relatively low, varying from 0.3 to 13 mg kg(-1). Factors extracted from the combined water dataset (Fl: Groundwater salinization and arsenic mobilization, F2: Clay minerals and Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, F3: pH and redox conditions, and F4: Aquifer oxygenation and nitrate contamination) accounted for 72.59% of the total variance. Water-rock interaction (e.g. sulfide oxidation, carbonate dissolution, silicate hydrolysis, adsorption-desorption, ion exchange, and evaporite dissolution), dilution/mixing with fresh/saline water components, evapoconcentration, and human induced perturbations causing internal salinization and oxygenation of the UBAS were the key mechanisms controlling the chemistry of waters and mobilization of As. In the UBAS, majority of As-rich water samples are confined to central-northem half of the basin and typically display high levels of dissolved O-2, inorganic oxyanions (HCO3, SO42- and of Si, B, Mo, Sb and V) and alkaline pH. Oxidation of sulfides (e.g. pyrite and arsenopyrite) found within the highly fractured Elazig magmatics in the upland areas at north and subsequent competitive adsorption-desorption processes occurring under alkaline, oxidizing and high ionic strength aquifer conditions along the downgradient groundwater flow path play a pivotal role in the As-enrichment in the UBAS. As concentrations ranged between 0.02 and 367.2 mu g L-1 in groundwater, 0.13-4842 mu g L-1 in spring water, and 0.04-31.1 mu g L-1 in the stream water samples, of which 20.83% exceeded the WHO provisional guideline value. In the water samples, As occurs mainly as As(V) species (HAsO42- and H2AsO4), indicated by the Eh-pH diagram and speciation calculations. The results of this study have shown that As enrichment in the UBAS can be attributed to both geogenic processes and anthropogenic activities that have modified the basin hydrology/hydrochemistry.

AB The goal of this study is to analyze fluid geochemistry, boron isotope and gas data to reassess the formation and evolution processes of the Changbaishan volcanic geothermal system (Jilin, China). Due to the presence of hot fumaroles (with temperatures of higher than 100 degrees C) and sinters, we believe that phase separation is occurring underground, which is also indicated by the characteristics of the B and gas data. Based on their hydrochemical data and B/Cl ratios, the thermal water samples in this area can be divided into three groups: 1) group 1 is steamheated/condensate water (group 1-1: JJ, JLQ; group 1-2: SBDG, XRQ); 2) group 2 is karst water (CR3 and LSD); and 3) group 3 is residual water (CR1 and CR2). The preliminary discrimination of samples using B and gas data implies that group 1-1 around the crater is controlled by a second phase separation process, which is induced by the input of hot magmatic material; group 1.2 in the basin area is controlled by the transformation of clay minerals, and the XRQ water sample shows contamination by sewage; group 2 represents karst water that has leached metamorphic rock and been directly heated by the input of hot magmatic volatiles; and group 3 is the result of one seawater phase separation process. The mixing and fluid-rock interaction models based on the mass balance of boron concentration and isotope imply that the phase separation and input of magmatic volatiles are more important than fluid-rock interactions in the formation of the Changbaishan geothermal system, and the first phase separation process in the deep carbonate reservoir occurred in a late stage, with approximately 75%-87.5% of water becoming vapor. Additionally, the Rayleigh distillation of B isotope implies that new magma is being generated below this area, with the low B concentrations and high boron isotopic values of its gases implying that the mixed component may be derived from the subducted Pacific plate (e.g., marine sediment). The addition of "excess heat" due to the continued subduction of the Pacific plate has further encouraged the phase separation process, and the subduction process has also accelerated the transition of the hydrothermal system into a non-hydrothermal system.

AB Lake Urmia-a shallow endemic hypersaline lake in northwest Iran-has undergone a dramatic decline in its water level (WL), by about 8 m, since 1995. The primary cause of the WL decline in Lake Urmia has been debated in the scientific literature, regarding whether it has been predominantly driven by atmospheric climate change or by human activities in the watershed landscape. Using available climate, hydrological, and vegetation data for the period 1981-2015, this study analyzes and aims to explain the lake desiccation based on other observed hydro-climatic and vegetation changes in the Lake Urmia watershed and classical exploratory statistical methods. The analysis accounts for the relationships between atmospheric climate change (precipitation P, temperature T), and hydrological (soil moisture SM, and WL) and vegetation cover (VC; including agricultural crops and other vegetation) changes in the landscape. Results show that P, T, and SM changes cannot explain the sharp decline in lake WL since 2000. Instead, the agricultural increase of VC in the watershed correlates well with the lake WL change, indicating this human-driven VC and associated irrigation expansion as the dominant human driver of the Lake Urmia desiccation. Specifically, the greater transpiration from the expanded and increasingly irrigated agricultural crops implies increased total evapotranspiration and associated consumptive use of water (inherently related to the irrigation and water diversion and storage developments in the watershed). Thereby the runoff from the watershed into the lake has decreased, and the remaining smaller inflow to the lake has been insufficient for keeping up the previous lake WL, causing the observed WL drop to current conditions.

AB The middle and down streams of Han River are complex river systems influenced by hydrologic variations, population distributions, and the engineering projects. The Middle Route of China's South-to-North Water Transfer (MSNW) project planned to transfer 95 billion m(3) annually from Han River to north China. The operation of the MSNW project may alter the flow rate and further influence the water quality of Han River. This study used min/max autocorrelation factor analysis (MAFA) and dynamic factor analysis (DFA) to analyze spatio-temporal variations of the water quality variables in three typical tributary-mainstream intersection zones in Han River from June 2014 to April 2017. MAFA results showed that chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspend solid (SS) and phosphate (PO43-) (represented as trophic dynamics) are main concerned water quality variables in densely populated zones (Zones 1 and 3), and total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-), COD, and PO43- (regarded as nutrient formations dynamics) represent the underlying water quality variations in agricultural cultivation zone (Zone 2). DFA results indicated that domestic and municipal effluent pollutants influence the organic concentrations and nutrient formations in the mainstream in Zones 1 and 2. The non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus discharged from the tributaries Tangbai and Hanbei Rivers elevate the nutrient concentrations and increase Chl-a concentration (i.e. promote the algal growth) in densely populated zones. In addition, controlling the flow rates in low and middle flow rate conditions can avoid degrading water quality. The flow rate should be elevated to more than 700 cm (cubic meters per second) in the middle stream and to more than 800 cm in the downstream of Han River for preventing water quality deterioration from high loadings of organic pollutants and nutrients. The integrated MAFA and DFA method establishes an efficient analysis distinguishing spatio-temporal variation of water quality variables and provides useful site-specific management to control water quality in various flow conditions.

AB Green roofs, in contrast to conventional roofs, retain significant stormwater, and are considerably appealing for urban regions to help mitigate flooding events and addressing serious environmental impacts of excessive or uncontrolled runoff. In designing a green roof, a careful selection of substrate material/depths, vegetation or slopes, or its optimal combination, is imperative but this issue remains underexplored by practicing hydrologists. Scale-based models of extensive green roofs were purposely designed and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted to comprehensively quantify runoff retention performance of extensive green roofs, to precisely determine the contribution of structural factors to stormwater retention. The results indicated that green roofs can effectively retain stormwater and delay the start of the runoff. To aver with this finding, influential contribution of four structural factors are ordered as follows: substrate material > substrate depth > slope > vegetation. This finding denotes that substrate material and its depth are major contributors to a green roof's stormwater retention capability. Statistical tests conducted on runoff retention showed the substrate materials and vegetation types had statistically significant effects, no statistically significant difference in runoff retention abilities among the three substrate depth treatments and the slope gradients considered. Given the same conditions, the study ascertains that runoff retention of low intensity events is likely to be relatively higher, while that of the heavy events is lower than its counterparts. The antecedent moisture contents of the substrate have a significant negative influence on the runoff retention and the time to the runoff.

AB Climate-stressed groundwater resources present a growing challenge for protecting food security and economic sustainability, notably in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). These states are some of the most vulnerable to climate stress because of their large coastlines, vulnerability to rising sea levels, weak access to reliable surface water, and limited food production capacity for handling increased groundwater scarcity. Impacts of climate stressed groundwater resources brought on by irrigation and growing urban demand in SIDS continue to receive widespread attention by both scientists and policymakers. Policies that limit pumping to protect aquifer sustainability reduce short-term economic welfare by unknown amounts that would otherwise be secured by both urban and irrigation water users. Yet, little scholarly research has addressed economic impacts of climate-water stress for the special needs of SIDS for which urban and irrigation pumping compete hydrologically and economically over long time periods. The original contribution of this work is to address that gap by employing downscaled data on precipitation from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) climate scenarios. Its novel contribution is to conceptualize, develop, apply, and interpret an integrated hydro-economic framework to understand interconnected physical and economic linkages from managing an unconfined regional aquifer system under each of three climate and two policy scenarios. The application is to Barbados, a SIDS, for which current and future irrigation and urban demands compete for water. The framework integrates groundwater hydrology, climate scenarios, economics, land use, and groundwater management, with the intent to mitigate impacts of climate stress on current economic values of water as well as protecting future aquifer sustainability. Results provide a framework to guide water management for SIDS vulnerable to climate stress for which water of the right quantity, quality, timing, location, and price are essential elements of economic development.

AB A general analytical procedure based on phase averaged formulation is presented in this work to investigate environmental dispersion in layered wetland. Based on concentration moments, Chatwin's long-time asymptotic technique is applied to describe both the longitudinal distribution of the depth-averaged concentration and the two-dimensional concentration field, including their longitudinal non-Gaussian effects of skewness and Kurtosis. Three wetlands of equal depth-averaged porosity but with different number of layers are studied to illustrate the impact of layered structure on solute transport. The layered structure of wetlands leads to great changes in velocity profiles and evolution of environmental dispersivity, skewness and kurtosis of depth-averaged concentration distribution. In each layer, vertical distribution of concentration is highly nonuniform in the initial stage of transport. Layers with different porosity result in essential difference between layer-averaged concentrations, of which all tend to be normally distributed.

AB Drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system. The vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation. The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability. This work attempts to evolve the SDVI by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information. At the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept. The new framework is applied in the South Platte Basin, within Colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (July-September). The proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers. SDVI could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts. Thus, it is believed that the SDVI could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions, allowing for a more integrated management approach.

AB Oscillatory pumping tests consist of injecting periodic discharge into an aquifer and measuring head response along vertical piezometers surrounding the well. The aim is to identify the specific storativity s and conductivity K of the aquifer, which are generally spatially variable. Recently, an analytical solution for oscillating head in a homogeneous formation was derived and applied to the Boise aquifer test site (Rabinovich et al., 2015). Equivalent properties S-eq, K-eq were identified by best fit of the computed and measured heads. Here, this approach is generalized for heterogeneous aquifers of spatially variable logconductivity (Y = InK), which is modeled as a stationary space random function characterized by K-G (geometric mean), sigma(2)(Y) (variance), I and I-nu (horizontal and vertical integral scales). Semi-analytical solutions are obtained for the mean head amplitude (<vertical bar H vertical bar >) and phase by a first order approximation in sigma(2)(Y). Application to a given realization requires a large ratio between the well length and I-nu, as well as availability of a large number of measurements (ergodicity). We define a correction term, psi representing the impact of heterogeneity on < H >. Investigating the dependence of psi upon the distance from the pumping well reveals the existence of a few regimes, namely a near well region in which it is independent of period and far away, where the solution pertains to a homogeneous aquifer of effective properties. The solution is applied to the Boise aquifer test by a best fit of <vertical bar H vertical bar > with the measured head in 3 piezometers, for a given value of sigma(2)(Y) = 0.5. In spite of the departure from ergodicity, the identification of K-G is quite robust and in agreement with previous tests while that of I is subject to uncertainty. An additional method for improving the identification of K by conditioning on measured point-wise head (co-kriging) is also outlined.

AB Most water conservation policies will target agriculture, the largest human consumptive use and that concentrating the marginal (i.e. least productive) uses of the resource. Adaptation to irrigation rationing policies at the micro level will have an impact on agricultural outputs and propagate to the rest of the economic sectors at a regional and supra-regional (macro) scale. As the economy transitions towards new equilibrium commodity prices, the relevant prices for agriculture will change and this will in turn affect irrigators' decisions. This paper proposes an iterative coupling between a decentralized, non-parametric Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming representation of irrigators and a regionally-calibrated Computable General Equilibrium model to assess interlinkages (i.e. two-way feedbacks) between the micro- and macro-economy. Results from an application to irrigation water charges in the Murcia Region in Spain show that the coupled micro-macro model yields lower abatement costs as compared to the stand-alone micro model.

AB Hydrogeological conceptual models are collections of hypotheses describing the understanding of groundwater systems and they are considered one of the major sources of uncertainty in groundwater flow and transport modelling. A common method for characterizing the conceptual uncertainty is the multi-model approach, where alternative plausible conceptual models are developed and evaluated. This review aims to give an overview of how multiple alternative models have been developed, tested and used for predictions in the multi-model approach in international literature and to identify the remaining challenges.
   The review shows that only a few guidelines for developing the multiple conceptual models exist, and these are rarely followed. The challenge of generating a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive range of plausible models is yet to be solved. Regarding conceptual model testing, the reviewed studies show that a challenge remains in finding data that is both suitable to discriminate between conceptual models and relevant to the model objective.
   We argue that there is a need for a systematic approach to conceptual model building where all aspects of conceptualization relevant to the study objective are covered. For each conceptual issue identified, alternative models representing hypotheses that are mutually exclusive should be defined. Using a systematic, hypothesis based approach increases the transparency in the modelling workflow and therefore the confidence in the final model predictions, while also anticipating conceptual surprises. While the focus of this review is on hydro geological applications, the concepts and challenges concerning model building and testing are applicable to spatio-temporal dynamical environmental systems models in general.

AB Until now, limited attention has been afforded to the role of, and challenges faced by, women involved in water diplomacy. In addition to research being at an early stage, it is mainly focused on addressing the challenges imposed by gender inequality. Thus very few applicable policy recommendations have emerged in this field to date.
   This paper will explore and identify current challenges that face the women interested in attaining high level positions in water diplomacy, in three Arab countries in which hydropolitics prevails, including Jordan, Lebanon and the State of Palestine. Female experts working on water-related issues were surveyed and interviewed to ascertain key qualitative issues, perceptions and various challenges. The focus of the paper was to identify the additional skills to be developed and acquired, for these women to better qualify as water diplomats both nationally and globally. In addition, the paper explores how to better equip women as leaders in the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 5 on Gender Equality and Goal 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation, in their national water sectors. The results provide a basic and initial mapping of current challenges and makes recommendations that would assist in the empowerment of those women in water diplomacy decision making positions in the regions investigated specifically, as well as globally.

AB Water and energy are considered as the two most important resources for human life and development, and can be represented by the nexus for the cross-sectional connection including water supply, wastewater treatment and hydropower generation sectors in a cascade reservoir system. In order to quantify interactions of the nexus, a novel diagram according to water and energy flow in every sector was proposed in this paper. And an optimal water-energy nexus model was also developed for the efficiently and effectively cross-sectoral coordinating the diagram based on the water and energy flow conceptual network. According to our case study in the middlelower Lancangjiang River basin, the nexus varies with the external water demand, water inflow conditions, instream ecological water demand constraints and the requirements of the electronic grid in the system. Moreover, the objective preferred by the decision maker only slightly influences the nexus results. The proposed approaches including the water-energy nexus diagram and its optimisation model are easily implemented and clearly visually illustrate the process of water and energy flow for every sector. The results of our optimal nexus configuration in the case study not only demonstrate the sensitivity of the parameters and input variables, but can also improve the understanding of the gap between current and optimal situations.

AB Climatic warming has resulted in permafrost degradation and it is expected to alter the hydrological processes and hydraulic connectivity on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Some important and pending issues for understanding the hydrological processes in permafrost regions are how much melting water from thawing permafrost can feed the stream water and how the hydraulic connectivities will be altered under continual permafrost degradation. In this study, the Source Area of the Yellow River locating on the Northeast QTP was studied by using stable isotopic method and field hydrological observation. Results exhibited significant seasonal hydrological variations of stream water, thermokarst lakes, and ground ice. Hydrograph separation suggested that precipitation is the main contributor to stream water in ice-free months, accounting for 53.5% and 52.2% of the streams on average for the two branches, respectively. The second source is springs, which contributed about 29.8% and 17.9%. However, the recharge from melting ice is also important; it exported an average of 16.7% and 13.2% to the surface stream. Conceptual model and stable isotopes emphasized the remarkable hydraulic connectivities between the precipitation, stream water, thermokarst lakes, spring, and the near-surface ground ice. Current findings provide a basic understanding of the log-term hydrological processes under permafrost degradation, and can offer an efficient way to assess future hydrological changes and water resource protection.

AB The Indian Ocean which is home to many islands and the low-lying coastal zones have attracted considerable attention due to regional sea level changes. In this study, we examine regional changes in sea level of the Indian Ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data. Various interpolation methods are evaluated to predict values at locations where data is unavailable. Based on the cross-validation analysis, the radial basis function is identified as the most optimal interpolation method and is used to analyze the spatial patterns of sea level changes. The analysis reveals that Bangladesh, Seychelles, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands have relatively high rates of sea level rise. These regions would thus be highly vulnerable to coastal flooding induced by the accelerating sea level rise in future decades, posing significant threats to coastal communities and ecosystems. Flooding impacts are examined through inundation mapping in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. In addition, relationships between regional factors (sea surface temperature, air temperature, and vertical land motions) affecting sea level rise are investigated. Our findings indicate that vertical land motion is an important factor affecting sea level changes for the regions of Seychelles and Cocos Islands. There is a strong relationship between air temperature and sea level rise for all studied regions. This study is a first attempt to examine regional changes in sea level of the Indian Ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data. The methods used in this study can be applied to other coastal regions around the world.

AB Despite the massive diversity in the modeling requirements for practical hydrological applications, there remains a need to develop more reliable and intelligent expert systems used for real-time prediction purposes. The challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale, and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets. River flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management, water demand assessments, irrigation and agriculture, early flood warning and hydropower generations. This paper aims to investigate the viability of the enhanced version of extreme learning machine (EELM) model in river flow forecasting applied in a tropical environment. Herein, we apply the complete orthogonal decomposition (COD) learning tool to tune the output-hidden layer of the ELM model's internal neuronal system, instead of the conventional multi-resolution tool (e.g., singular value decomposition). To demonstrate the application of EELM model, the Kelantan River, located in the Malaysian peninsular, selected as a case study. For a comparison of the EELM model, and further model evaluation, two distinct data-intelligent models are developed (i.e., the classical ELM and the support vector regression, SVR model). An exhaustive list of diagnostic indicators are used to evaluate the EELM model in respect to the benchmark algorithms, namely, SVR and ELM. The model performance indicators exhibit superior results for the EELM model relative to ELM and SVR models. In addition, the EELM model is presented as a more accurate, alternative predictive tool for modelling the tropical river flow patterns and its underlying characteristic perturbations in the physical space. Several statistical metrics defined as the coefficient of determination (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-ns), Willmott's Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed to assess the model's effectiveness. In quantitative terms, superiority of EELM over ELM and SVR models was exhibited by E-ns = 0.7995, 0.7434 and 0.665, r = 0.894, 0.869 and 0.818 and WI = 0.9380, 0.9180 and 0.8921, respectively. Whereas, EELM model attained lower (RMSE and MAE) values by approximately (11.61-22.53%) and (8.26-8.72%) relative to ELM and SVR models, respectively. The obtained results reveal that the EELM model is a robust expert model and can be embraced practically in real-life water resources management and river sustainability decisions. As a complementary component of this paper, we also review state-of-art research works where scholars have embraced extensive implementation of the ELM model in water resource engineering problems. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to recognize the current limitations, and also to propose potential opportunities of applying improved variants of the ELM model presented as a future research direction.

AB The 2003-2013 monthly groundwater storage (GWS) anomalies in the highly karstic region (HKR) and low karstic region (LKR) in the Southwest China are estimated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage (TWS) data by using the ancillary data of surface water storage (SWS) and soil moisture storage (SMS) from the WaterGAP model simulations. The leakage errors in the estimated GWS anomalies are corrected through using the iterative forward modelling approach. The estimated GWS anomalies compare well with in situ groundwater-level observations with the correlation coefficient r = 0.71 and the rootmean-square-error (RMSE) = 42 mm. For both HKR and LKR, similar to 60% of temporal variability of TWS is contributed by GWS variability, while SMS contributes to 18% (HKR) and 28% (LKR), and SWS contributes to 22% (HKR) and 14% (LKR) of the TWS variability. Due to the higher permeability of the epi-karst zones and their better connection with the subsurface aquifers, GWS anomalies in HKR show larger correlations with SWS (r = 0.73, RMSE = 51 mm) and SMS (r = 0.68, RMSE = 47 mm) and a shorter lag to precipitation than that in LKR (SWS: r = 0.56, RMSE = 50 mm, and SMS: r = 0.48, RMSE = 49 mm). During the extreme drought in 2009, GWS loss in HKR (LKR) was 74.3 mm/yr (42.7 mm/yr), accounting for 66% (62%) of total TWS loss. The severe GWS loss was mainly due to larger discharges through the well-developed subsurface drainage system rather than human depletion, since groundwater resources are still under-exploited in Southwest China ( similar to 4 km(3)/yr, 12% of the potentially exploitable amounts). A quicker recovery of GWS from 2009 drought can be observed in HKR than LKR due to the larger and earlier (approximately one month) precipitation and infiltration, and quicker response of groundwater to precipitation in HKR.

AB The hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of precipitation and water vapor are useful tracers in the water cycle. The water balance of inland river basins located in the monsoon marginal zone are difficult to determine, because little is known about the contribution of various vapor involved. Based on the three-component isotopic mixing model, the monthly precipitation, surface water and plant water isotope data of the seven sampling stations from April to October 2017 were used to assess the vapor contribution to precipitation in the Shiyang River basin.
   The average contribution of plant transpiration, land surface evaporation and adverted vapor to precipitation accounted for 11%, 6% and 83% in the Mountain regions, for 21%, 7% and 72% in the Oasis regions, and for 10%, 5% and 85% in the Desert regions, respectively. The contribution of plant transpiration and surface evaporation vapor was similar in time variation, and the maximum value appeared in July. The average plant transpiration vapor contribution at each station was always greater than the surface evaporation vapor. Different landscape and special underlying surfaces are important factors influencing the difference in water vapor contribution. The average surface evaporation water vapor contribution of the Xiying (M1) station is the largest in the study area, with a contribution fraction of 9%. The contribution of Wuwei oasis recycled moisture can reach 30%, the plant transpiration vapor accounted for 73%.

TI Impacts of the hydropower-controlled Tana-Beles interbasin water

AB Despite public awareness of unintended impacts (1980s) and well-developed international standards (2000s), downstream impacts of large hydropower projects still very often are not properly assessed. Impacts of (hydropower-regulated) interbasin water transfers (IBWTs) are considered self-evidently positive, although they can have far-reaching consequences for hydrogeomorphological systems and consequently river-dependent communities. In this study, the downstream direct and indirect impacts of the Ethiopian hydropower-regulated Tana-Beles IBWT are evaluated in an interdisciplinary way. The components of the framework of rural livelihoods are considered and changing contexts, resources' availabilities and livelihood strategies are analysed. Mixed methods are applied, combining hydrogeomorphological field observations, GIS analyses, scientific literature, policy documents, and semi-structured interviews with local people and local to federal authorities. Results show that the IBWT drastically increased the Beles river's discharge (with an average release of + 92 m(3) s(-1 )at the outlet; *2 in rainy season and *12 in dry season 100km downstream of the water release) and introduced dangerous situations for local communities (over 250 people drowned in the river). River bank erosion resulted in the uncompensated loss of farmland (163 ha) and the establishment of large-scale commercial farms increased the pressure on land and led to the impoverishment of displaced communities (4310 households). The project was implemented top-down, without any transparency, benefit sharing or compensation for external costs. This stresses the importance of downstream interdisciplinary impact assessments and highlights the need for decent in-depth ex post-analyses of hydropower projects. Environmental impact assessments should be taken seriously and cannot be considered a formality. In Ethiopia and in many developing countries, the hydropower industry is booming. Although dams and IBWTs can be the best solution for water-related problems in specific contexts, national development goals (such as the expansion of the electricity network) should not be at the expense of rural livelihoods.

AB The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is a new tool for continuously monitoring mean soil-water content (SWC) on a hectometer scale, but the performance of CRNPs in highly heterogeneous distributions of SWC, vegetation and especially soil texture caused by the broken surface on the Loess Plateau in China remains uncertain. The study evaluated the application and accuracy of the method for three soil textures in a small watershed on the plateau to provide a reference and scientific basis for its application. Three CRNPs were installed in a loamy sand hills (LSH) plot, a silty loam dam (SLD) plot, and a sandy loam slope (SLS) plot, soil moisture sensors were buried at various depths in three plots. The footprints of the CRNPs for SWC observation had radii of 127-170, 126-174 and 148-174 m in SLD, SLS and LSH, respectively, and the mean measuring depth was about 20 cm for SLD and SLS and 40 cm for LSH based on general calculation equations. The accuracy of the CRNP method was high when validated using oven-dried method (RMSE = 0.068 cm(3) cm(-3)). The mean SWCs estimated from the other types of sensors were consistent with the mean SWCs from the CRNP probes in the three plots. The coefficient of determination of the linear relationship was in the order: SLS > LSH > SLD. The coefficient of variations (CV) were higher in LSH than SLD and SLS, indicating that SWC varied most in LSH. During periods of rain, the variations were larger for SLD than SLS and LSH, with a CV of 32.2%. The CRNP for SLD had the highest rates of change during periods with and without rain for both increasing and decreasing SWC, but this plot held more water than LSH and SLS, consistent with the high clay and organic-matter contents in SLD. The rates of change were significantly correlated with the antecedent SWCs (P < 0.01), and the higher the antecedent SWC, the faster the rate of change for each plot. This study verified the application of the CRNP for monitoring field-average SWC of the broken surface on the Loess Plateau and represents a new approach for the study of the spatial distribution of SWC on the plateau. CRNP can measure SWC of the complex underlying surface accurately, so as to provide a more reliable assessment of the impacts of landscapes and vegetation changes, such as conversion of cropland to forest and grassland on the Loess Plateau on water resources.

However, the 2007-2010 and 2012-2017 droughts have caused strong increases in groundwater pumping causing land subsidence with strong variability in location, magnitude (total subsidence) and rate of subsidence. In this study, we try to understand what caused these variations. We focus our analyses on three areas: (i) the Westland water district where subsidence was very small during the two drought periods, (ii) 'El Nido' area where the greatest subsidence rate was monitored from 2008 to 2010, and (iii) the' Kings-Tulare counties' area where the subsidence was small during the 2008-2010 and the largest during 2015-2017 droughts. Our main finding is that land subsidence is located in areas where the water demand for agriculture and the density of groundwater wells is the highest, whereas the rate of subsidence is strongly affected the amount of local and imported surface water and by groundwater resources. Based on these simple observations, we propose using continuous satellite-based ground deformation monitoring and geomechanical modeling to (i) localize areas most prone for future subsidence and (ii) to estimate and manage groundwater resources.

AB Subsidence and ground uplift are phenomena that may have natural or anthropogenic origin and cause strong socioeconomic and environmental impacts, especially in urban areas. In this paper, the coupling between ground uplift and groundwater rebound in a complex multi-layered aquifer system in the metropolitan city of Naples (southern Italy) has been investigated. By an integrated use of hydrogeological and DInSAR monitoring data covering the periods 1989-2013 and 1993-2010, respectively, the spatio-temporal evolution of natural ground deformation following the strong reduction and interruption of groundwater pumping has been analysed. Hydrogeological monitoring data have shown large-scale groundwater rebound, with the highest amplitude of approximately 16 m and a groundwater rising velocity up to approximately 1.0 m/yr. DInSAR data show a general ground uplift with a magnitude of approximately 40 mm on average, except for the southern sector of the study area where some local natural and human-induced subsidence has been identified. A comparison between trends of groundwater level and ground displacement indicates that the ground uplift is linked to a poro-elastic rebound mechanism in the porous aquifer system, which is triggered by the increase of pore pressure, while the rate of ground displacement is controlled by the hydrostratigraphic characteristics of the multilayered aquifer system. The results improve the knowledge of man-induced deformation in complex urban aquifers affected by groundwater rebound and highlight that the implementation of an appropriate hydro-mechanical deformation model is a necessary step to correctly model and manage a new geohazard in a highly urbanized environment.

AB Rivers and streams are important agents for global and regional carbon cycle, which represent a nonnegligible carbon source to the atmosphere. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) degassing via water-air interface from inland waters currently has a large uncertainty in estimation. Here we examined the CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and CO2 degassing in the Daning River, a main tributary of the Yangtze in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region. The riverine pCO(2 )showed obvious spatial and temporal variations on the main stem and its tributaries, ranging from 483,2 +/- 293.9 mu atm (May) to 2183.3 +/- 1309.2 mu atm (August) with an average of 1198.2 +/- 1122.9 mu atm. pCO(2) increased with the intensive agricultural practices and population on the lower reach of the tributary. The daytime average water-air CO2 flux was 329.8 +/- 470.2 mmol/m(2)/d, and yielded a total CO2 efflux approximately 0.12 Tg CO2/y. The results also indicated that carbon loss via atmospheric exchange accounted for 38.8% of riverine dissolved carbon fluxes. There were close relations between pCO(2) and environmental parameters such as total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and water temperature in the rainy season, but not in the dry season. Our results demonstrated the essential need to highlight the importance of anthropogenic activities on global and regional CO2 outgassing, and it is urgent to underscore the detailed biogeochemical processes in riverine pCO(2), as well as the couplings between pCO(2) and environmental parameters.

AB An analytical model for describing pumping induced drawdown by constant-head test at a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer is developed by treating the leakage of aquitard storage as an interface phenomenon rather than an volumetric effect, which is the novel and never developed so far. Three different cases of remote lateral boundaries are considered in the model. The new drawdown solution in Laplace space is obtained and inverted into time-domain solution utilizing the Stehfest method. The (semi-)analytical solutions for well discharge are then obtained under three different cases. Analytical solutions in Laplace and time domains are developed for calculating the (total) leakage rate and volume across the aquitard-aquifer interface due to constant-head test at a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer, and such solutions are of great use for groundwater resource management. Based on the newly developed solutions, the distribution of wellbore flowrate and aquitard leakage are explored and the sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the most important controlling factor. The sensitivity analysis shows that the wellbore flowrate and the drawdown in infinite (Case 1), finite (Case 2), and closed (Case 3) leaky confined aquifer systems are both sensitive to the variation of well partial penetration, well radius, and aquifer anisotropic ratio during the whole pumping period and they are most sensitive to the change of outer boundary distance at late time for Case 3. The effect of the outer boundary on the drawdown or wellbore flowrate is more significant for a shorter outer boundary distance.

AB Road construction associated with land development generally increases erosion and sediment yields. Construction of unpaved roads has the potential to alter hydro-sedimentological behavior and catchment sediment source dynamics and, to date, this has largely been investigated in forested environments. The objective of this study, therefore, was to assess the relative importance of unpaved recreational roads as a sediment source alongside hillslope surface soils and stream channel banks in a non-forested mountainous catchment in northern Tehran, Iran, using a fingerprinting procedure. Eleven geochemical tracers were measured on 27 samples collected to characterise the sediment sources and five suspended sediment samples collected at the study catchment outlet. The statistical analysis employed to select three different composite fingerprints for discriminating the sediment sources comprised: (1) the Kruskal-Wallis H test (KW-H), (2) a combination of KW-H and discriminant function analysis (DFA), and (3) a combination of KW-H and principal components & classification analysis (PCCA). A Bayesian un-mixing model was used to ascribe sediment source contributions using the three composite fingerprints. Using the KW-H composite signature, the respective relative contributions (with uncertainty ranges) from recreational roads, hillslope surface soils and channel banks were estimated as 64.5% (57.7-73.1), 1.1% (0.1-4.9), and 33.9% (24.9-41.0), compared to 55.3% (45.5-68.5), 1.9% (0.1-7.9) and 42.1% (27.8-52.4) using a composite signature selected using a combination of KW-H and DFA, or 82.0% (69.7-93.8), 8.2% (0.7-22.7) and 7.3% (0.7-21.0) using a fingerprint selected using KW-H and PCCA. The root mean square difference between the apportionment results using the fingerprints identified on the basis of the three different statistical approaches ranged from 5.5% to 25.7%, highlighting the sensitivity of source estimates to the tracers used. Regardless, the different composite signatures all suggested that unpaved recreational roads were the dominant source of the suspended sediment samples, underscoring the need for mitigation measures targeting these anthropogenic features of the catchment system, including closure to permit re-vegetation, surface ripping and/or mulching to improve infiltration or gravel re-surfacing to reduce exposure of bare surfaces to sediment mobilisation.

AB Lake Chad was once the sixth largest lake in the world, with a surface area of about 25,000 km(2) in the early 1960s. However, it has shrunk to almost only one-twentieth of its maximum area by now. As the biggest river of the Lake Chad basin, the Chari/Logone River contributes approximately 90% of Lake Chad's water input. Consequently, several previous studies have focused on the Chari/Logone River system to investigate the causes of Lake Chad's shrinkage. However, due to the lack of authoritative irrigation and natural runoff observations, it is usually difficult to explain the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability. In this paper, unlike the hydrological modeling approaches used in previous studies, a conceptual and statistical approach was presented to investigate discharge variations and the causes leading to such variations. Specifically, the runoff .change caused by climate variability (Delta Q(climate)) was estimated using Budyko analysis, while that caused by human activities (Delta Q(h)(uman)) was estimated using regression analysis. The accuracy of estimation was evaluated through cross validation and comparison with previous studies. The comparison suggests that due to the lack of natural runoff and irrigation withdrawal observations, the runoff simulation produced by previous hydrological models suffers from large errors. The water loss of the Chari/Logone River discharge is dominated by human activities rather than climate variability. On annual average scale, the total water loss caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities is 16.76 km(3). The relative contribution of Delta Q(climate) and Delta Q(h)(uman) is 26.83% and 73.17%, respectively. The role of human activities is particularly obvious in recent ten years from 2003 to 2013. Due to the increase of rainfall and irrigation withdrawals, the relative contribution of human activities accounts for more than 80% of the total water loss.

AB Understanding soil water storage (SWS) dynamics in soil profiles is important for hydrological modeling and restoration of vegetation in semi-arid areas. Using the temporal stability method, we aimed to investigate the temporal stability of SWS at 0-40, 40-80, and 80-120 cm depth, and to identify representative sites for reliable estimates of the mean SWS in the permanent forest plot in the Qilian Mountains of China. Further, we wanted to identify correlations between temporal stability of SWS and soil, topography, and properties of the vegetation. Soil water content at soil depths 0-120 (for locations 1-40) and 0-70 cm (for locations 41-60) were measured using time-domain reflectometry (TDR) on 52 dates from 2016 to 2017.
   Results revealed that time-averaged mean SWS for the three layers differed significantly (P < 0.05), and the temporal changes and spatial variations of the mean SWS all decreased with increasing soil depth. Based on either the Spearman correlation coefficient or the standard deviation of relative difference (SDRD) index, the temporal stability of SWSs within the soil profiles under different soil layers were strong, and the number of time-stable locations increased with increasing soil depth, indicating that the SWS intended to be more temporally stable in deeper soil. One time-stable site can be representative of the mean SWS for multiple soil layers for the whole plot, and can accurately estimate the mean SWS for the three soil layers (R-2 > 0.86, P < 0.001). Moreover, these time-stable locations should be those having average LAI, SBD or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means. Soil bulk density, canopy interception rate, and aboveground biomass of mosses can significantly (P < 0.05) affect the stability of SWSs in this high-elevation forests. Such effects, however, differed among the different soil layers due to different conditions of soil characteristics, distribution of root biomass, and freeze-thawing processes. These results suggest that the influence of vegetation properties of the temporal stability of SWS should attract more attention and that both the relative importance of and interactions among different determining factors is helpful for better understanding the mechanistic determinants of SWS temporal stability in these areas.

AB How does physical history of flood-related hazards affect individuals' perceptions? The present study represents a unique effort to understand perceptions of flood hazards in light of the geographic background. Situated in Alabama, the United States, the cities of Mobile and Huntsville display two different physical geographic contexts. Despite one being a coastal city (Mobile) and the other being an inland city, both are similarly vulnerable to flooding. We first present results of historical analyses of heavy precipitation in both cities and analysis of storm surge history in the city of Mobile. We then report results of both descriptive statistical and inferential statistical analyses based on a two-city residents' survey that was conducted in the spring of 2016. We find that residents in both cities are able to connect the particular natural hazard of flooding with their physical environments. Residents in both cities are influenced by their perceptions of precipitation when making assessments of flooding. Despite the fact that Huntsville has not experienced heavy precipitation events as much as Mobile in recent history, residents of Huntsville tend to link heavy rainfall - the most frequent cause of flooding in that city, with flooding. In contrast, residents of Mobile tend to link hurricanes, more particularly hurricane number, with flooding. These results show that people are attuned to their physical environments and take into consideration their personal observations when forming perceptions of natural hazards. More studies need to be conducted to further investigate the dynamics of physical exposure to hazards and risk perceptions in other geographic areas.

AB Fractured geological media are complex systems where hydrodynamic parameters are highly variable as result of their structure. Indeed, measured parameters depend on the scale and the implemented methodologies. with high variability of hydrodynamic parameters. This variableness also depends on the scale of measurement. Most theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media adding uncertainty to the fractured media hydrogeological characterization. In fractured media, the complexity is even harder to characterize as available theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media. Nevertheless, the increase of underground engineering projects and their reported impacts on surface and groundwater resources claim efforts to a better understanding of fractured media groundwater hydrodynamics. In this work, we propose a general approach for the scale-dependence of the hydraulic conductivity based on power law concepts. To do so, the hydraulic conductivity field of a highly fractured massif in the Colombian Andes is estimated over scales from 6 cm to 12 km. Laboratory measurements, re-analyzes of hydraulic tests, and calibration of 3D numerical models were performed, using the La Linea tunnels (in Colombia) as real scale laboratory. Hydraulic conductivity values vary up to four orders of magnitude at each characteristic length scale and show an increase until the local scale, followed by a small decrease at regional scale. In this way, field and regional scales display the same orders of magnitude. Finally, the scale-dependence of the hydraulic conductivity values based on power law concepts is proposed. As a consequence, it suggests the possibility to use field data in regional models, once hydrogeological units and structures are properly defined.

AB Complete hydrological time series are necessary for water resources management and modeling. This can be challenging in data scarce environments where data gaps are ubiquitous. In many applications, repetitive gaps can have unfortunate consequences including ineffective model calibration, unreliable timing of peak flows, and biased statistics. Here, Direct Sampling (DS) is used as a non-parametric stochastic method for infilling gaps in daily streamflow records. A thorough gap-filling framework including the selection of predictor stations and the optimization of the DS parameters is developed and applied to data collected in the Volta River basin, West Africa. Various synthetic missing data scenarios are developed to assess the performance of the method, followed by a real-case application to the existing gaps in the flow records. The contribution of this study includes the assessment of the method for different climatic zones and hydrological regimes and for different upstream-downstream relations among the gauging stations used for gap filling. Tested in various missing data conditions, the method allows a precise and reliable simulation of the missing data by using the data patterns available in other stations as predictor variables. The developed gap-filling framework is transferable to other hydrological applications, and it is promising for environmental modeling.

TI Modelling spring discharge and solute transport in conduits by coupling

AB Karst aquifers differ from unconsolidated granular aquifers with respect to their groundwater flow behavior because of the dual-permeability characteristics (discrete conduit network coupled to a fissured matrix), the duality of recharge (point vs. diffuse recharge) as well as the duality of flow (laminar vs. turbulent state). In many karst aquifers, the epikarst frequently plays an important role in redistributing precipitation as diffuse recharge into the fissured matrix and as point recharge into the conduit network as well as for the temporal distribution of recharge input. In this paper, a coupled groundwater model CE (CFPv2 + ERCH) is developed, consisting of a combination of a simple reservoir model generating the recharge source function assuming the concept of an epikarst horizon (ERCH) with CFPv2, a discrete conduit-continuum groundwater flow model of the phreatic karst aquifer. The CE model is applied to simulate spring discharge and a tracer breakthrough in a karst aquifer near Guilin City in southwest China. In order to examine the effect of an added epikarst reservoir model, simulations are carried out with CFPv2 but without including ERCH. Simulation results of both, spring hydro-graph and tracer breakthrough, indicate that CFPv2 with ERCH performs much better. A sensitivity analysis of the CE reveals the relative importance of parameters characterizing the epikarst reservoir. Point recharge is a main factor determining the large variation in spring discharge and its proportion to total recharge can reach 58%. These simulation results highlight the importance of the temporal and spatial distribution of recharge to karst spring discharge response. The coupled model provides an effective approach to include the effect of an epikarst zone in CFPv2 and it can easily be applied for the simulation of karst aquifers with similar characteristics as the study site.

AB The arid and semi-arid regions of the world are facing limited freshwater resources, minimal amounts of rainfall, and increasing population pressure and water demands. These resources, often groundwater, are vulnerable to both natural variability and anthropogenic interventions. Here, we develop and apply an integrated approach using geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing observations to quantify the recharge rates of arid region aquifers that are witnessing rapid groundwater depletion. Focusing on the Saq aquifer system in the Arabian Peninsula, our study was three-fold: (1) to examine the areal extent of aquifer recharge domains using geologic, climatic, and remote sensing data; (2) to investigate the origin of, and modem contributions to, the aquifer system by examining the isotopic composition of groundwater samples; and (3) to estimate the magnitude of modem recharge to the aquifer utilizing estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and a continuous rainfall-runoff model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Isotopic examination of the groundwater from Saq revealed that deeper aquifers (fossil water) are more depleted compared to shallow reserves (alluvial aquifer; mixed waters). Analysis of GRACE-derived terrestrial and groundwater storage estimates indicates that the aquifer system received an annual recharge rate of 5.21 +/- 0.10 Km(3)/yr (11.85 +/- 0.22 mm/yr), equal to about half of the withdrawal rate from wells during the investigation period (2002-2016). Analysis of SWAT results indicates that, from 1998 to 2014, the investigated watersheds received an average annual precipitation of 19.20 km(3), of which approximately 51% is partitioned as potential recharge. The temporal variations in storage, depletion and recharge are related to the changes in regional groundwater extraction, rainfall, and extent of irrigated areas.

AB Precipitation and air temperature are key drivers of watershed models. Currently there are many open-access gridded precipitation and air temperature datasets at different spatial and temporal resolutions over global or quasi-global scale. Motivated by the scarcity and substantial temporal and spatial gaps in ground measurements in Africa, this study evaluated the performance of three open-access precipitation datasets (i.e. CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data), TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and CFSR (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis)) and one air temperature dataset (CFSR) in driving Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in simulation of daily and monthly streamflow in the upper Gilgel Abay Basin, Ethiopia. The "best" available measurements of precipitation and air temperature from sparse gauge stations were also used to drive SWAT model and the results were compared with those using open-access datasets. After a comprehensive comparison of a total of eight model scenarios with different combinations of precipitation and air temperature inputs, we draw the following conclusions: (1) using measured precipitation from even sparse available stations consistently yielded better performance in streamflow simulation than using all three open-access precipitation datasets; (2) using CFSR air temperature yielded almost identical performance in streamflow simulation to using measured air temperature from gauge stations; (3) among the three open-access precipitation, overall CHIRPS yielded best performance. These results suggested that the CHIRPS precipitation available at high spatial resolution (0.05 degrees) together with CFSR air temperature can be a promising alternative open-access data source for streamflow simulation in this data-scarce area in the case of limited access to desirable gauge data.

AB Antecedent soil moisture is an important factor in the generation of runoff, but guidance for modeling moisture conditions in semiarid catchments is limited and conflicting. In this study, the impact of antecedent moisture was assessed at the plot scale (2.8 m(2)) using a portable rainfall simulator, and at the catchment scale based on observed precipitation and discharge for a 2.8 km(2) watershed in central New Mexico. Performance of three loss models commonly used for hydrologic analysis in the southwestern U.S. was tested at both scales. High initial moisture content led to substantially higher runoff ratios at both scales, confirming the importance of antecedent soil moisture for runoff predictions in semiarid drainages. Hydrologic parameters estimated based on plot experiments, however, were highly variable and cannot easily be upscaled to the catchment scale. Loss model performance was clearly scale dependent more simplistic (one- and two parameter) loss methods out-performed a more complex (four parameter) model at the watershed scale, while the opposite held true for test plot simulations. At the catchment scale, all models performed poorly for small runoff events, but yielded acceptable results for storms causing large discharges if antecedent soil moisture was considered. Failing to account for antecedent moisture led to simulated runoff volume errors up to one order of magnitude.

AB It is indispensable for the sustainable water supply of the human society to distribute the available water resources with maximal efficiency among the different consumers while assuring the needed time for recharge. The theoretically established, effective tool for the solution of this allocation problem is mathematical modelling with special regard to the methods of game theory.
   In the present paper, a differential game is proposed to describe the consumption and the (natural) recharge of a limited water resource. Then the general course of the solution of the allocation problem is given aiming at maximizing the players' yields through the discretization of the strategy sets. In case of two consumers, the solution is given in more details along with several practical examples. The Pareto optimality of the non-co-operative solution (Nash equilibrium) is checked and the Pareto optimal strategy pair, which provides maximal sum payoff for the players, is suggested for cooperation (after a possible re-distribution of the payoffs). This cooperative solution generally provides higher payoff for each player than if they consumed according to conflicting non-cooperative behaviour. In addition, examples with three consumers are provided similarly.

AB In coastal areas, flood events can result from the interaction of several factors such as rainfall, river flow and the classical tidal asymmetry to mention but a few. Therefore, flood risk assessment in these areas involves not only the estimation of the extreme values of each variable, but also their probability of occurring simultaneously. This study investigates the combined effect and dependence between a "heavy" rainfall with a high tidal levels forcing on the occurrence and severity of floods in the urban neighborhood close to the estuary of the Bouregreg River (Morocco). The methodology used for this analysis is based on a bivariate copula model to evaluate the joint risk probability of flood events. The estimated joint probability is used to define the boundary conditions for a hydraulic model to quantify the water levels and the extent of floods caused by the combination of both extreme rainfall and storm surge. The considered variables reveal a not negligible correlation, and the copula approach seems to be suitable and enough flexible, for analyzing separately marginal distributions of the source variables and their structure of dependence. Results show that the joint probability of rainfall and tide both exceeding their critical thresholds remains low to moderate, and the biggest threat to this area might be caused by heavy rainfall. However, high tide adds an extra risk by reducing the capacity of the urban drainage in absorbing storm water; especially when rainfall intensity exceeds 100 years return period. Although rainfall and tide introduce a wide range of time scale meteorological forcing, this won't prevent storm surge and extreme rainfall events resulting from climate change, to take place in the future, on the same day leading to some of the most critical flooding scenarios in this area.

AB Catchment-scale hydrological and hydrogeological investigations commonly conclude by finding that particular stream reaches are either gaining or losing; they also often assume that the influence of bedrock aquifers on catchment water balances and water quality is insignificant. However, in many cases, such broad findings are likely to oversimplify the spatial and temporal complexity of the connections between the different hydrological system components, particularly in regions dominated by cycles of droughts and flooding. From a modelling perspective, such oversimplifications can have serious implications on the process of identifying the magnitude and direction of the exchange fluxes between the surface and groundwater systems.
   In this study, we use 3D geological modelling and historic water chemistry and hydraulic records to identify the origins of groundwater at different locations in the alluvium and along the course of streams in the Lockyer Valley (Queensland, Australia), a catchment impacted by a severe drought ('Millennium Drought') from 1998 to 2009, followed by extensive flooding in 2011. We also demonstrate how discharge from the sub-alluvial regional-scale volcanic and sedimentary bedrock influences the water balance and water quality of the alluvium and streams. The investigation of aquifer geometry via development of a three-dimensional geological model combined with an assessment of hydraulic data provided important insights on groundwater flow paths and helped to identify areas where bedrock aquifers interact with shallow alluvial aquifers and streams. Multivariate statistical techniques were then applied as an additional line of evidence to groundwater and surface water hydrochemical data from large historical datasets. This confirmed that most sub-catchments within the Lockyer Valley have distinct water chemistry patterns, which result from mixing of different water sources, including discharge from the sub-alluvial bedrock. Importantly, in addition to the observed spatial variability, time-series hydrochemical groundwater and surface water data further demonstrated that the hydraulic connection between alluvial aquifers, streams and sub-alluvial bedrock aquifers is temporally dynamic with very significant changes occurring at the transition from normal to drought conditions and following flooding, affecting both catchment water quality and water balances.

AB To make an overall assessment of the groundwater quality in Seoul city, we used the self-organizing map (SOM) technique in combination with fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. SOM visualizes complicate and multidimensional data structures on a 2D surface while the FCM algorithm creates overlapping cluster boundaries among samples that are continuously distributed over a data space. The combination of SOM and FCM clustering was expected to help characterize highly complicated urban groundwater quality. As a result, the SOM characterized 343 groundwater samples using 91 neurons, which were further classified by FCM clustering into three water groups. Group 1 addressed the least polluted groundwater (17% of the samples (n = 58), average TDS = 194.5 mg/L and NO3 = 6.9 mg/L) and occurred in the peripheral areas whose land cover is mainly occupied by forests. Increasing pH with increasing sodium and bicarbonate concentrations indicated that the hydrogeochemistry of Group 1 was largely controlled by water-rock interactions. Group 2 included the highly polluted groundwater (24% of the samples (n = 82), average TDS = 326.2 mg/L and NO3 = 42.6 mg/L), and sporadically occurred in Seoul, with no distinct spatial control. This group seemed to be affected by sewage from broken sewer pipes, which are a primary pollution source of Seoul groundwater and are ubiquitously distributed beneath the city. Group 3 water also represented the highly contaminated groundwater (30% of the samples (n = 103), average TDS = 527.1 mg/L), but contained low nitrate concentrations (average NO3 = 13.1 mg/L). Based on their spatial locations, intensive groundwater pumping from subway tunnels and other underground spaces at the city center seemed to drive the induced flow of organic contaminants, resulting in local reducing conditions sufficient for denitrification. The remaining 100 samples (29% of the samples) shared the hydrogeochemical properties of two or three groups. This study successfully characterized the spatial pattern of urban groundwater quality that is complicated by various contamination sources and hydrogeochemical processes. The combined use of SOM and FCM clustering was proven as a powerful tool to interpret nonlinear and highly heterogeneous environmental data for which it is difficult to define cluster boundaries. Taken together, our results contribute to a better management of urban groundwater in metropolitan cities under high risks of anthropogenic contamination.

AB Climate change has the potential to exacerbate eutrophication and the risk of harmful algal blooms in lakes. Periodic adjustment of nutrient criteria, as the cornerstone of eutrophication control and water quality management, is expected to help mitigate the impact of climate change on harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The nutrient criteria that do not threaten the function of the water body determined with generalized additive models (GAMs) were 0.88 mg/L for total nitrogen (TN) and 0.021 mg/L for total phosphorus (TP) during the period of 1996-2005 based on 26 lakes and reservoirs in China. Climate change-induced temperature increases will substantially reduce the required nutrient criteria by 46.17% for TN and 15.24% for TP in lakes and reservoirs by the end of the century under the "business-as-usual" scenario. The results indicate that some lakes that currently meet the nutrient criteria could become dominated by cyanobacteria and experience blooms in a warmer future, even without increases in nutrient inputs. Therefore, as climate change persists, nutrient loads should be further reduced to achieve the desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication. Strict control of TP would be particularly advantageous to suppress algal blooms. It is imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future climate changes on nutrient criteria and that nutrient criteria are periodically modified. The corresponding nutrient risk thresholds should be determined to ensure that lakes and reservoirs escape the threat of harmful algal blooms under the impact of extreme weather events.

AB This paper compares the hydrological responses at the local scale of two models using different degrees of refinement to represent physical processes in sparsely instrumented mountainous Himalayan catchments. This work presents the novelty of applying, at a small spatio-temporal scale and under the same forcing conditions, a fully distributed surface scheme based on mass and energy balance equations (ISBA surface scheme), and a semi-distributed calibrated model (J2000 hydrological model). A new conceptual module coupled to the ISBA surface scheme for flow routing is presented. Two small catchments located in mid- and high- mountain environments were chosen to represent the very different climatic and physiographic characteristics of the Central Himalayas in the Everest region of eastern Nepal. The results show that both models globally represent the dynamic of the processes for evaporation, quick runoff and discharge in a similar way. The differences in the model structures and results mainly concern the snow processes and the soil processes. In particular for the high-mountain catchment, the snow-pack simulation is shown to be the main driver of the discrepancy between the two models. The sub-daily variations of snow processes are shown to significantly influence the estimation of the snow-melt contribution to discharge.

AB The combination of remote sensing techniques and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to measure water quality allows researchers to monitor changes in various water quality parameters over temporal and spatial scales that are not always readily apparent from in situ measurements. This study involves using Landsat images and in situ data within GIS to map urban expansion and its resulting influences on water quality in the Pontchartrain Basin over the last three decades. The Pontchartrain Basin is located in southeast Louisiana and covers an area of 25,000 km(2) that encompasses sixteen parishes east of the Mississippi River and four Mississippi Counties. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image from 1985 and a Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) image from 2015 were processed using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm to map urban expansion. In order to estimate how water quality has changed in the Pontchartrain Basin between 1985 and 2015, in situ water quality data from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality was interpolated using Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK). Comparing urban expansion produced from SAM classification with urban indices, impervious surfaces were better identified and distinguished from other land cover features. The results of this study demonstrated that high levels of fecal coliform were consistent with increased urbanization in water bodies in the Pontchartrain Basin. Phosphorous levels were higher in 2015 compared to 1985 and were at levels high enough to lead to eutrophic conditions. Dissolved oxygen levels were lower near the mouth of the Mississippi river in 2015 than in 1985. The results indicated that urbanization has negative impact on water quality. The geospatial model is recommended to effectively manage and reduce the processing time of large water quality datasets.

AB In the Central Sudetes, the areas of sedimentary Permian and Carboniferous rocks are characterized by small resources of groundwater and are much less understood than aquifer systems occurring in the crystalline and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. The environmental tracer studies conducted in a double sampling cycle during changing conditions of groundwater inflow can significantly facilitate the understanding of hydrogeological conditions in areas of the complicated geological structure. Therefore, in order to identify the hydrogeological conditions of study area, measurements of geogenic and anthropogenic gases (He, Ne, Ar, CFC-11, CFC-12 and SF6), determinations of isotopic composition of groundwater (delta O-18, delta H-2 and H-3) and the hydrogeochemical data (including selected REEs, thorium and uranium) were used. The research, which was conducted both in natural groundwater flow conditions and in conditions of flow disturbed by the continuous exploitation of the groundwater, enabled, among other things, a direct determination of the rate of maximum decomposition of CFC-11 and CFC-12 at depths of 50-450m in the elastic rocks. It ranges from 189 to 315.10(-12)g.L-1.yr(-1) for CFC-11 and from 110 to 198.10(-12)g.L-1.yr(-1) for CFC-12. The research conducted also indicates that in the study area the vertical or nearly vertical groundwater flow may have significance comparable to the lateral groundwater flow. This results in an intense mixing of groundwater which leads to the local occurrence of groundwater containing the ions and gases in concentrations characteristic of the deep aquifers in the studied area, with the simultaneous occurrence of ions and gases of anthropogenic origin. The results of measurements on CFCs, SF6 and noble gases indicate a significant inflow of young groundwater to the whole freshwater zone. An occurrence of a geogenic SF6 source, which is most probably associated with volcanic rocks, was also found. Calculated the groundwater ages indicate that the research area is dominated by groundwater of age less than 1 ka, and mainly in the range of 0.05-0.25 ka. The results of modeling of the influence of the variability of U and Th concentrations on the He in situ production within the aquifer (P-He) indicate, that for groundwater with He concentrations of 10(-6)-10(-8)cm(3) STP g(-1), i.e. modem groundwater, the He in situ production within the aquifer is actually negligible, so it may be omitted in the calculation of their age. Considering the fact that, in the study area which is terrain with elevated uranium concentration there is no significant effect of P-He on groundwater dating using the helium method, it can be concluded that the dating results obtained with this method in such areas can be fully comparable with those obtained for areas with lower concentrations of uranium. It was also found that mobile Ions of uranium and suspension of thorium compounds occurred in the groundwater are not a significant source of He in situ production within the studied aquifers.

AB This paper emphasizes the importance of integrating outlet discharge and observed internal variables in the evaluation of distributed hydrological models outputs. It proposes a general methodology for a diagnostic evaluation of a complex distributed hydrological model, based on discharge data at the outlet and additional distributed information such as water level and surface soil moisture data. The proposed methodology is illustrated using the PUMMA model in the Mercier sub-catchment (6.6 km(2)). Model parameters are specified according to field data and a previous study performed in a neighbouring catchment (Jankowfsky et al., 2014), without calibration. The distributed water level and soil moisture network of sensors were useful in the model evaluation process. Thus, model parameters are specified either using in situ information or results from previous studies. A stepwise approach is used for model evaluation. It includes standard water balance assessment as well as comparison of observed and simulated outlet discharge, whether on annual or event timescales. Soil moisture sensors are used to assess the ability of the model to simulate seasonal water storage dynamics based on a normalized index. The water level sensors network is used on two timescales: on a seasonal timescale, sensors network is used to assess the model's ability to simulate intermittency; whereas on event timescales, sensors network is used in determining the model's ability to reproduce observed reaction as well as response times. Event timescales do also focus on the correlation between hydrological response and either rainfall event or antecedent soil moisture variables. Results show that the non-calibrated model is quite effective at capturing water flow and soil water-storage dynamics, but it fails to reproduce observed runoff volume during events. There is strong indication of a deficiency in the characterization of catchment storage and upstream flowpath description. The soil water content and a network of water level sensors provide interesting information about soil moisture and river flow dynamics. They however fail to provide quantitative information about catchment storage. This study opens interesting perspectives for the evaluation of distributed hydrological models using hydrological signatures. Furthermore, it highlights the requirement of quantitative as well as qualitative signatures for improving such models.

AB In this study, with the use of a multiple linear regression approach, the tree-ring chronologies of eight sampling sites in the upper Lancang-Mekong River Basin were developed to provide a 449-year (CE 1557-2005) reconstruction of the annual runoff, thus placing recent changes in annual runoff into a long-term context. These eight tree-ring chronologies have recently been archived in publicly available databases through the International Tree-Ring Data Bank. Reconstruction results showed a good correlation coefficient of 0.662 (n = 39, p-value < 0.01) between the reconstructed and the observed annual runoff. The adjusted coefficient (R-2) for the degrees of freedom is 42.3%, which meets the precision requirements of reconstruction. The reconstructed runoff displays a trend toward more moist conditions: there were 37 extremely wet years and 23 extremely dry years, exceeding the mean +/- 1 standard deviation, during the past 449 years. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was used to fully analyze and understand the multi-scale variation of the reconstructed runoff. Six intrinsic mode function (IMF) components with different scales were obtained and the sum of all components can be reverted to the original variable sequence. The first and second IMF mainly reflect the change characteristics of the interannual scale of reconstructed sequence. Both are likely controlled by the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), respectively. The third IMF showed a 10-13 year scale fluctuation, which is very similar to the solar activity of an 11-year cycle. The fourth and fifth IMF mainly represents multidecadal and centennial oscillations, and they have shown coherent variations with predecessors' reconstructed May-September precipitations in the same time domain. The lowest frequency component (the residue IMF) represents the trend term of the original signal.

AB Three hydroelectric reservoirs (Kralkizi, Dicle and Batman) in the Tigris River basin (Turkey) were sampled monthly during one year in order to reveal spatial and seasonal changes in aqueous partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and to estimate diffusive fluxes of CO2 from the reservoirs' surface water. pCO(2) concentrations did not show significant spatial differences, while they showed significant seasonal variations. Temperature, precipitation and biological CO2 uptake through photosynthesis controlled pCO(2) seasonality in the reservoirs, with maximal concentrations in the winter (ranging from 516.9 mu atm in Kralkizi to 1299.2 mu atm in Dicle) and minimal concentrations in the spring (ranging from 47.7 mu atm in Batman to 140.7 mu atm in Kralkizi). Most studies reported that reservoirs worldwide are net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, the reservoirs in this study were sinks for atmospheric CO2 during the spring, summer and autumn seasons, while they were CO2 sources to the atmosphere during the winter. Air-water CO2 fluxes in Kralkizi, Dicle and Batman dam reservoirs were 2.39, 32.88 and 8.12 mmol/m(2)/day in the winter, respectively. On an annual basis, all three reservoirs acted as a sink for atmospheric CO2. These estimated CO2 fluxes were in the lower range for temperate reservoirs, despite the potential for winter conditions that shifted the reservoirs from sink to net source for atmospheric CO2.

AB We report evaporation characteristics due to higher heating from above from surfaces having an array of line sources. The line sources are created by vertically stacked rectangular plates in a box with water. Two different types of plates were used. In one case line source or film thickness was 66 mu m and open area ratio was 4%, and in the second case film thickness was 28 mu m and 20% was the open area ratio. Even at the 4% open area ratio the evaporation rate was similar to 85% compared to a bare water surface, at the same heat flux. Lateral conduction of heat from the impervious hotter regions to the line sources and the 2-D nature of diffusion near these tiny line sources enhances the evaporative flux, owing to increase in the concentration gradient of water vapour, explains the high evaporation rate, observed in the present work. This system bridges the gap between the understanding of evaporation from bare water surfaces (1-D vapour diffusion) and leaf surfaces (3-D vapour diffusion). Evaporation rates for the fully saturated conditions are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of Suzuki and Maeda (1968) and Schlunder (1988). The computed surface temperatures and its width-wise variation match well with the experimental values. We also propose a simple film model for the unsaturated condition of the porous medium and show that the temperature distribution obtained using this model is in reasonably good agreement with the measured values.

AB Based on the runoff and sediment load data series obtained at the Guide hydrological station (GHS) in the upper reaches of the Yellow River from 1960 to 2013, the varying quasi-periodic fluctuations of runoff and sediment load existing in different decomposed time scales are revealed by using the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) method pre- and post-reservoir operation. Combined with entropy theory, the concepts of multi-time scale entropy (MTSE) and multi-time scale structural entropy (MTSSE) are proposed to analyze the complex fluctuation characteristics of runoff and sediment load at different time scales. The results show that reservoir operation has a greater influence on sediment load than that on runoff at multi-time scales, and that their correlations change as well. Additionally, reservoir operation can aggravate the complexity of the runoff and sediment load, but with longer fluctuation time scales, this complexity decreases and predictability increases. After reservoir operation, the fluctuation period of high frequency components in runoff and sediment load is elongated, and the information content of runoff and sediment load is focused at the short-middle time scale. Therefore, the available and reasonable monitoring and research periods for runoff and sediment load in the upper reaches of the Yellow River are suggested as 4-7 years and 3-4 years, respectively.

AB While extensive green roofs are popular measures for reducing and delaying stormwater runoff, design tools are needed to better predict roof performance based on material properties, geometry and climate. This paper investigates the EPA's Storm Water Management Model's (SWMM) green roof module for this purpose based on observed runoff from several roofs with different build-ups, geometry, and climates. First, the general model performance was investigated and secondly transferability of model parameters for similar roofs but different geometries and climates was tested. Individual models reproduced runoff hydrographs well (NSE 0.56-0.96), while the long-term modelling showed relatively large volume errors most likely due to insufficient representation of evapotranspiration in the model. Model parameters obtained at one site were only partly transferable to similar roof build-up at other sites. Transferability was better from models calibrated with wetter climates and higher intensity events to drier climates, than the opposite way. Multi-site calibration resulted in model parameters performing well for most sites, giving model parameters that could be used for the design of similar roof build-ups in comparable climates. However, large variability in obtained model parameters, large volume errors and the fact that the calibrated model parameters did not directly correspond to measured material properties, place concerns on the generality of the SWMM green roof module as a design tool.

AB Proxy forward solvers are commonly used in Bayesian solutions to inverse problems in hydrology and geophysics in order to make sampling of the posterior distribution, for example using Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods, computationally tractable. However, use of these solvers introduces model error into the problem, which can lead to strongly biased and overconfident parameter estimates if left uncorrected. Focusing on the specific example of estimating unsaturated hydraulic parameters in a layered soil from time-lapse ground-penetrating radar data acquired during a synthetic infiltration experiment, we show how principal component analysis, conducted on a suite of stochastic model-error realizations, can for some problems be used to build a sparse orthogonal basis for the model error arising from known forward solver approximations and/or simplifications. Projection of the residual onto this basis during MCMC permits identification and removal of the model error before calculation of the likelihood. Our results indicate that, when combined with an informal likelihood metric based on the expected behaviour of the l(2)-norm of the residual, this methodology can yield posterior parameter estimates exhibiting a marked reduction in bias and overconfidence when compared to those obtained with no model-error correction, at reasonable computational cost.

AB A stochastic hydro-geostatistical assessment approach is proposed to evaluate the predictability of streamflow simulation as a function of precipitation observation network density. This approach is based on the paradigm of a controlled data assimilation simulation algorithm, known as Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). The OSSE-based algorithm is designed to simulate a data assimilation technique known as Statistical Interpolation (SI). In SI, observations are combined with short-term precipitation forecasts through variographic analysis. The assessment approach was designed in two stages. At the first stage of the assessment, SI precipitation analysis is stochastically simulated to construct a hypothetical true reference precipitation field, while at the second stage, the variographic by-products of the SI Gaussian process are used to perturb the reference field in order to produce the pseudo counterparts of the SI input components. The pseudo terms are then combined in SI to compute the pseudo precipitation analysis while various network scenarios are considered. Distributed hydrologic modeling is then performed to convert reference and pseudo analysis datasets into streamflow. The proposed assessment approach can be used to assess observation networks of various densities; however, it is particularly effective in sparsely gauged basins. To demonstrate the application of the approach to a real-world case, the sparse observation network in the Churchill River basin (CRB), which covers an area of roughly 296,000 km(2) in the Canadian boreal ecoclimatic region, was assessed. Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis from 2002 to 2012 was extracted from the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) data assimilation system and used while generating the reference field. Gridded precipitation data from both stages of the assessment were used as input to WATFLOOD (TM) distributed hydrologic model. Quantitative assessment of streamflow suggested that an observation network with a density in the order of 3 stations/10,000 km(2) in the CRB can satisfy hydrological criteria while maintaining the network as an integral part of the CaPA's SI data assimilation technique.

AB Background: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both related with high in-hospital mortality. We aimed to investigate the impact of COPD on the in-hospital outcomes in PAD.
   Methods: PAD patients were selected based on ICD-code I70.2 of the German nationwide database, stratified for COPD and compared regarding adverse in-hospital outcomes.
   Results: Between 01/2005-12/2015, 5,611,827 inpatients (64.8% males) were diagnosed with PAD; of those, 13.6% were coded additionally with COPD. Overall, 277,894 PAD patients (5.0%) died during in-hospital course. Prevalence of cardiovascular diseases as well as cancer (12.1% vs. 7.0%, P < 0.001) was higher in PAD patients with COPD compared to PAD patients without COPD. PAD patients with COPD showed more often lower PAD stages according to Fontaine classification (PAD stage I: 27.1% vs. 19.3%, P < 0.001; PAD stage IIa: 34.9% vs. 35.5%, P < 0.001; PAD stage IIb: 14.5% vs. 13.6%, P < 0.001; PAD stage III: 11.8% vs. 14.8%, P < 0.001; PAD stage IV: 13.8% vs. 19.6%, P < 0.001).
   The all-cause in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in PAD patients with COPD compared to those without COPD (6.5% vs. 4.7%, P < 0.001). Cardiovascular events comprising pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction occurred more often in coprevalence with PAD and COPD. COPD was an independent predictor of in-hospital death (OR 1.16 (95% CI 1.15-1.17) P < 0.001) and an independent predictor for pulmonary embolism (PE, OR 1.44 (1.40-1.49), P < 0.001) in PAD patients.
   Conclusion: COPD was associated with a high in-hospital mortality in PAD patients probably driven by higher frequencies of PE and cancer.

AB Background: Stability of asthma is a clinical phenotype of the disease based on long-term evaluation of control of asthma symptoms and its exacerbations. A relationship between airway inflammation and clinical classification of asthma based on stability criterion has not been well studied.
   Objectives: The purpose of our study was to analyze the inflammation profile of stable and unstable asthma in adolescents treated with moderate and high doses of inhaled corticosteroids.
   Methods: 139 young asthmatics of 16.8 (3.25) years were classified in the stable group (N= 72) and unstable group (N= 67) after a 3-month prospective observation. Inflammatory markers including cytogram of the induced sputum (IS), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) following provocation with hypertonic saline and exercises, as well as clinical and spirometric parameters in both groups were compared.
   Results: 75% of patients with unstable asthma revealed elevated percentage of eosinophils in the induced sputum (> 2.5%), and mean values were significantly higher in comparison with stable asthma: 2.0 (0,5-4,2) vs 5,5 (2,6-11,3), p < 0,001. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was markedly higher in unstable asthma, especially in asthma with eosinophilic profile; statistically significant differences also related to functional pulmonary tests. In multivariate analysis, asthma instability was significantly associated with sEos (p=0.005), BHR (p=0.001) but not FeNO (p=0.24).
   Conclusion (and clinical relevance): Eosinophilic inflammation, relatively resistant to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, is a dominant type of inflammation in unstable asthma in adolescents. Asthma instability is also associated with higher bronchial hyperresponsiveness and lower spirometric parameters. In the light of the new studies and progress in biological methods of therapy of eosinophilic inflammation, unstable asthma, especially in case of severe course, requires extended diagnostics with determination of inflammatory phenotype.

TI Beyond inspiratory muscle strength: Clinical utility of single-breath
   work capacity assessment in veterans with COPD
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE COPD; Inspiratory muscle function; Single-breath work capacity
ID PULMONARY; VALIDATION; MORTALITY; ENDURANCE; RATIO
AB Background: Inspiratory muscle function in COPD has been traditionally described in terms of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). Arguably, however, is the day-to-day relevance of MIP, given that individuals rarely need maximal inspiratory forces to perform general tasks, but rather repeated breathing muscle contractions which demand endurance. The sustained maximal inspiratory pressure (SMIP) reflects the ability of the respiratory muscles to maintain force over time (i. e. single-breath work capacity). We investigated the relationships between SMIP and COPD-related clinical outcomes, hypothesizing that SMIP would have superior correlational and discriminatory value when compared to MIP.
   Methods: 61 males with mild-to-very severe airflow obstruction underwent measures of spirometry, whole-body plethysmography, symptomatology, comorbidity, quality of life, exacerbations and mental health. MIP and SMIP were obtained via the Test of Incremental Respiratory Endurance.
   Results: The mean +/- SD MIP and SMIP were 77.2 +/- 22.9 cm H2O and 407.9 +/- 122.8 PTU. Both MIP and SMIP positively correlated with pulmonary function, with SMIP displaying the highest correlations. We found significant differences in spirometry, hyperinflation, symptomatology, exacerbation frequency, comorbidity, quality of life and anxiety in subjects grouped as having reduced or normal single-breath work capacity. Finally, significantly lower SMIP values were found in individuals with an IC/TLC ratio 25%. <=
   Conclusions: The assessment of SMIP appears to have superior clinical value than MIP in COPD. Our analyses revealed that subjects whose SMIP was reduced experienced more severe airflow obstruction, greater hyperinflation, as well as worse health and mental status with increased symptomatology and impaired quality of life.

ID EOSINOPHILIC ASTHMA; ATOPIC ASTHMA; COSTS; FENO; UK
AB Background: Allergen avoidance is important in allergic asthma management. Nocturnal treatment with Temperature-controlled Laminar Airflow (TLA; Airsonett (R)) has been shown to provide significant reduction of exposure to allergens in the breathing zone, leading to long-term reduction in airway inflammation and improvement in quality of life. Allergic asthma patients uncontrolled on GINA step 4 were found to benefit the most. A frequently asked question from clinicians and funders is related to time to onset (TTO) of improvements for patients using TLA.
   Methods: Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores were collected in a previous study. TTO of improvements in Quality of Life was analysed for difference (TLA-placebo) in Area-under-Curve using backwards deletion from 12, 9, 6, 3 down to 1 month for the AQLQ total score, the four individual domains and specifically the sleep question.
   Results: Patients with uncontrolled asthma on GINA step 4 (n=87)) reported a statistically significant and clinically relevant (>= 0.5 point) improvement in total AQLQ score (0.57; p=0.009) after 3 months treatment for TLA over placebo. The shortest TTO was within 1 month for the environmental domain (0.68; p=0.016) and the sleep question (0.771; p=0.037). TTO for the emotional and symptom domains was 3 months (0.66; p=0.020 and 0.64; p=0.014 respectively) and for the activity domain 6 months (0.47; p=0.036).
   Conclusion: Nocturnal avoidance of allergens using TLA provided a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in total AQLQ score within 3 months in patients in the GINA 4 + ACT< 18 group. Questions related to sleep quality may provide the first signal of response already within a month after commencing treatment.

ID PREVALENCE
AB Background: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that causes widespread abnormal vasculature development, resulting in multiple complications including pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite the potential severity of PH, there is a lack of data on hospitalization characteristics and outcomes in the HHT-PH population. The purpose of this analysis was to describe trends and outcomes of HHTPH hospitalizations within the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS).
   Methods: Adult hospitalizations (age >= 18 years) with a principal or secondary diagnosis of HHT were identified from the 2000-2014 NIS. Records were stratified by a concurrent PH diagnosis. Trends, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalizations with HHT and PH were analyzed.
   Results: There were 55,189 adult hospitalizations with HHT from 2000 to 2014, of which 4602 (8.3%) had a concurrent diagnosis of PH. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose steadily from 165 (5.1%) in 2000 to 540 (13.8%) in 2014 (p < 0.001). They were more common in females (vs. HHT without PH, 71.6% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001) and were associated with a higher comorbidity burden (total 4.0 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.03, p < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was higher in HHT-PH hospitalizations than in HHT without PH (3.5% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, the diagnosis of PH remained significantly associated with a higher risk of inpatient death (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.63, p= 0.015) in HHT hospitalizations.
   Conclusions: HHT-PH hospitalizations rose from 2000 to 2014. Notably, HHT patients with a concurrent PH diagnosis were at significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

TI Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by virtual means using
   "IPFdatabase"- a new software
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE IPF; Database; Diagnosis; Software
ID PIRFENIDONE; PLACEBO; TRIAL
AB Background: The diagnostic algorithm for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) guidelines has some shortcomings. The aim of the present study was to develop a novel software, "IPFdatabase", that could readily apply the diagnostic criteria per IPF guidelines and make a 'virtual' diagnosis of IPF.
   Methods: Software was developed as a step-by-step compilation of necessary information according to guidelines to enable a diagnosis of IPF. Software accuracy was validated primarily by comparing software diagnoses to those previously made at a Center for Interstitial Lung Diseases.
   Results: Clinical validation on 98 patients (68 male, age 61.0 +/- 8.5 years), revealed high software accuracy for IPF diagnosis when compared to historical diagnoses (sensitivity 95.5%, specificity 96.2%; positive predictive value 95.5%, negative predictive value 96.2%). A general radiologist and a general pathologist reviewed relevant data with and without the new software: interobserver agreement increased when they used the IPFdatabase (kappa 0.18 to 0.64 for radiology, 0.13 to 0.59 for pathology).
   Conclusion: IPFdatabase is a useful diagnostic tool for typical cases of IPF, and potentially restricts the need for MDDs to atypical and complex cases. We propose this web-designed software for instant accurate diagnosis of IPF by virtual means and for educational purposes; the software is readily accessed with mobile apps, allows incorporation of updated version of guidelines, can be utilized for gathering data useful for future studies and give physicians rapid feedback in daily practice.

TI Impact of smoking status and concomitant medications on the effect of
   high-dose N-acetylcysteine on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   exacerbations: A post-hoc analysis of the PANTHEON study
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Mucolytic; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Exacerbations
ID DOUBLE-BLIND; TRIPLE THERAPY; COPD EXACERBATIONS; CHRONIC-BRONCHITIS;
   PARALLEL-GROUP; PLACEBO; PREVENTION; SALMETEROL; TIOTROPIUM; TRIAL
AB Background: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 600 mg twice daily is a well-tolerated oral antioxidant mucolytic that reduces the risk of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. PANTHEON was one of the largest studies to evaluate NAC in COPD. It recruited current, ex-and never-smokers, concomitantly treated with other medications, and used a symptom-based definition of COPD exacerbations rather than the conventional healthcare resource utilisation (HCU) criteria.
   Methods: This manuscript reports post-hoc analyses of the PANTHEON dataset investigating whether smoking status or use of concomitant medications influenced the efficacy of NAC in terms of reducing exacerbations, defined according to HCU.
   Results: Compared with placebo (N=482), NAC (N=482) reduced the rate of HCU events by 20% (p=0.0027), with a larger effect in current/ex-smokers (23%; p < 0.01). In patients receiving NAC and longacting inhaled bronchodilator(s) but no ICS, there was a 60% reduction in the rate of exacerbations compared to those receiving placebo, long-acting bronchodilator(s) and ICS (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Overall, these post-hoc hypothesis-generating analyses confirm that NAC reduces the rate of COPD exacerbations, particularly in patients with COPD who have a significant smoking history, and in those not treated with ICS. NAC may provide an alternative to ICS-containing combinations in these patient subgroups.

   medication
ID RAPID ORAL DESENSITIZATION; ALLERGIC REACTIONS; SYSTEMIC SYMPTOMS;

AB Background: Delayed drug hypersensitivity to first-line anti-tuberculosis medication is a major challenge in tuberculosis treatment. Objective: This study was performed to investigate the efficacy/tolerability of desensitization therapy in treatment of first-line anti-tuberculosis medication hypersensitivity and the usefulness of immunologic evaluation therein.
   Methods: This study was conducted as a prospective, observational cohort study. Subjects who experienced hypersensitivity reactions, including maculopapular exanthema (MPE) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), to first-line anti-tuberculosis medications (isoniazid [INH], ethambutol [EMB], rifampin [RFP], and pyrazinamide [PZA]) were enrolled. Patch, intradermal, lymphocyte transformation, and oral provocation tests were performed to determine culprit drugs, which were desensitized with rapid and graded challenge protocols. Breakthrough reactions (BTRs) during or after desensitization were assessed.
   Results: In total, 31 desensitization treatments (INH, 8; EMB, 8; RFP, 11; PZA, 4) to 12 patients (8 with MPE and 4 with DRESS) were performed. The overall success rate of desensitization was 80.7%. All the study subjects except one completed the full course of anti-tuberculosis treatment. The overall BTR free rate was 64.5%. Sixteen (80%) treatments for MPE and four (36.4%) for DRESS were BTR free (P=0.023). Drugs that were positive on any two of three immunologic studies showed significantly high BTR rates (P=0.014), although this was not correlated with desensitization failure rate.
   Conclusion: Rapid desensitization therapy to multiple anti-tuberculosis medications for delayed drug hypersensitivity was safe and successful. Combination of multiple immunologic evaluations may predict BTR although it needs validation in larger studies.

AB Purpose: the study aims at describing the role of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) on daytime symptoms, quality of sleep and quality of life (QoL) in patients with moderate-severe IPF.
   Methods: we enrolled 34 consecutive room air breathing IPF outpatients who received a full-night polysomnography. The following questionnaires were administered: Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), StGeorge's Questionnaire (StGQ).
   Results: patients were classified in 3 groups: Group A (NO-SDB, 9 patients), Group B(OSAS without sleep-related hypoxemia, 17 patients), Group C(OSAS with sleep-related hypoxemia, 8 patients). Although sleep parameters showed no significant differences among the 3 groups, worse measures were found in group C. 50% of patients (17/34) reported a StGQ score indicating a reduced QoL and the StGQ score was significantly higher in group C patients compared to group A (p < 0.05). In the stepwise multiple regression analysis, 75% of StGQ score variability was significantly predicted by FVC(Forced Vital Capacity) %, DLco (diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide)%, PSQI and ESS.
   Conclusions: in patients with IPF both subjective and polysomnographic poor sleep quality are extremely common features, they are predicted by variables associated with SBD severity and are linked to low QoL. IPF with more severe SDB present poor sleep quality and a worse QoL compared to SDB-free or OSAS-only.

ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; EXACERBATIONS; VILANTEROL; FUROATE; LIFE
AB Background: SLS COPD was the first open-label randomised controlled trial demonstrating a reduction in moderate/severe COPD exacerbations with once-daily inhaled fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) in everyday clinical practice. Here we report FF/VI effectiveness and safety in predefined patient subgroups.
   Methods: Patients with COPD, exacerbation history, and receiving maintenance inhaler therapy, were randomised to initiate FF/VI 100/25 mu g or continue usual care (UC) with 12 months' follow-up. Annual rates of moderate/severe exacerbations (primary outcome), selected secondary outcomes, and incidence of pneumonia serious adverse events of special interest (SAESI) were compared between randomisation groups across various patient subgroups/baseline treatment strata. SAESI rates by actual treatment were also assessed.
   Results: Lower exacerbation rates were observed for FF/VI versus UC across all subgroups/strata, including ICS + LABA therapy subset (8.0% [0.1, 15.4]), except in patients without baseline airflow limitation (-0.5% [-29.8, 22.1]). Larger reductions compared to the overall analysis were observed for patients on ICS-containing regimens (excluding LAMA) before the study (15.6% [3.4, 26.3]), and with baseline CAT score< 10 (25.3% [-0.4, 44.4]). Pneumonia SAESI rates were similar for FF/VI versus UC across all subgroups/strata, except the LABA, LAMA or LABA+ LAMA stratum (incidence ratio 2.8 [0.9, 8.5]). SAESI rates were not increased for FF/VI versus other ICS + LABA.
   Conclusions: Initiating FF/VI versus continuing UC reduced exacerbation rates without increased pneumonia SAESI risk compared to other ICS-containing regimens and in various patient subgroups, consistent with primary study findings. FF/VI may be a therapeutic option for a broad population of COPD patients, including those with more severe disease.

AB Background: Recurrent joint pain is frequently observed in patients with CF and can lead to reduced activity and quality of life. We conducted this observational study to assess the clinical manifestations, frequency, and risk factors of CF associated arthropathy.
   Methods: Clinical data were collected using a digital quality management system, medical records, and by conducting structured interviews. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were performed for statistical interpretation. Study design: retrospective observational study including 186 patients.
   Results: Of 186 patients (Demographics: Mean age 27 years, female gender 104/186 (57%), CFTR F508del homozygous 82/186 (44%) included in the study, 54/186 (29%) had experienced joint symptoms. Joint pain and swelling were the most frequent symptoms. The joints of the hands (JOH) followed by the joints of the feet were most affected. No specific pattern of autoantibodies was discovered.
   The level of total serum IgG, age, female gender, and pulmonary exacerbations per year were significant risk factors for arthropathy in the study cohort.
   Conclusions: Joint symptoms in CF are a frequent and clinically relevant phenomenon with a distinct clinical pattern. Pulmonary exacerbations and elevated levels of total serum IgG may reflect chronic inflammation in patients with CF and may lead to a specific arthropathy associated with this condition.

DE Probe based confocal laser endomicroscopy; pCLE; Pleural carcinomatosis;
   Malignant mesothelioma; Thoracoscopy; Optical biopsies
AB Probe based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a new optical endoscopic technique, generating fluorescent light emission from the tissue of interest and allowing in vivo live imaging at a cellular level ("optical biopsies").
   To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first to present pCLE images during medical thoracoscopy. We present here 3 different patients referred for various health problems. A precise description of pleural cavity pCLE images after intravenous fluorescein injection (a fluorophore) together with corresponding macroscopical and histological studies is performed. This led to the diagnosis of normal pleura in one case, carcinomatous pleuritis in another case and a malignant mesothelioma in the third case.
   We believe that optical biopsies could help clinicians to make an early diagnosis, thereby allowing rapid therapeutic intervention (talc pleurodesis for example). Furthermore, it could help to guide biopsies when affected zones are not obvious to macroscopic examination.
   In a near future, new fluorophores could be developed to stain some pathophysiological processes, therapeutic targets, or enzymes activities bringing new insights in endoscopic pleural disease work-up.

AB Background: Age at asthma onset is associated with severity and outcomes of the disease.
   Objective: We studied if age at asthma diagnosis is related to employment and outcomes in working career.
   Patients and methods: A questionnaire was sent to 2613 adults with asthma in Tampere, Finland, and a follow-up questionnaire was sent after six years. Asthmatics were divided into groups based on their employment status: working full-time or work disability. Logistic regression was used to study the association of age at asthma diagnosis with employment status at baseline and with the risk of exiting full-time work during follow-up period.
   Results: In cross-sectional analysis, asthma diagnosed in late adulthood (50 + years) was associated with higher OR for having work-disability compared to childhood onset asthma (OR [95% CI] 3.60 [1.43-9.06]). During follow-up, asthma diagnosed in late adulthood was associated with higher OR for exiting full time work compared to childhood-onset asthma (OR 10.87 [3.25-36.40]).
   Conclusions: Asthma diagnosed in late adulthood is a higher risk for poor employment than asthma diagnosed earlier in life. Adult-onset of asthma is an important factor in view of work ability and early rehabilitation procedures.

AB Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, and ultimately fatal, chronic interstitial lung disease characterized by enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. Repetitive alveolar epithelial injury triggers the early development of fibrosis. These injuries, in combination with dysregulated wound repair and fibroblast dysfunction, lead to ongoing tissue remodelling and fibrosis seen in end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Although the exact etiology in IPF is unknown and probably diverse, all stages of fibrosis are accompanied by innate and adaptive immune responses. The role of inflammation as an important component in IPF etiology is controversial and sometimes seen as an epiphenomenon of fibrosis. This view is partly the result of negative multicenter trials of anti-inflammatory drugs for IPF treatment. However, new insights on the role of macrophages, the loss of T-cell and B-cell tolerance leading auto-immune responses in IPF, and the interaction of immune cells with (myo) fibroblasts have led to a slow change of this opinion. Clearly, more insight is needed to integrate basic immune mechanisms into translational research and finally new IPF therapies.
   In this concise review, we will focus on the role of our innate and adaptive immune system in the initiation and perpetuation of IPF pathobiology. Next, we will discuss how immune responses are influenced by current anti-fibrotic treatments, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib and end with an overview of recent and upcoming therapeutic trials that target and modulate our immune system in patients with IPF.

AB Intracranial chondromas are rare, benign neoplasms representing only 0.2%-0.3% of neoplastic intracranial lesions. They commonly originate from the skull base but can infrequently arise from the falx, convexity dura, or ventricular ependyma. Diagnosis requires histopathologic confirmation, as patients present with nonspecific symptoms related to mass effect, and imaging characteristics often resemble meningiomas, oligodendrogliomas, and vascular malformations. We describe the case of a patient harboring a parafalcine dural chondroma that was discovered incidentally and was managed surgically at our institution. We also provide a systematic review of the literature to elucidate incidence, origin, imaging findings, surgical management approaches, and prognosis of this rare tumor.

AB BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for central nervous system disease commonly involves collaboration between Radiation Oncology and Neurosurgery. We describe our early experience with a multidisciplinary clinic model.
   METHODS: In 2016, the novel RADIANS (RADIation oncology And NeuroSurgery) clinic model was initiated at a community hospital. Disease and treatment demographics were collected and analyzed. Patient satisfaction was assessed via a blinded survey questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Forty-two patients have been seen since the inception of RADIANS. The median age was 65; and the median patient distance from RADIANS was 42.7 miles (mean = 62.6; range = 0.7-285). Half of the patients traveled >50 miles to receive care, and >80% were seen for central nervous system metastases. Of the patients receiving radiation, 75% received stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic body radiation therapy. The mean overall satisfaction from 0 (not satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied) was 4.8.
   CONCLUSIONS: The RADIANS clinic model has proved viable and well-liked by patients in a community setting, with the majority of radiation therapy administered being stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic body radiation therapy rather than conventional fractionation.

   OSTEOTOMY; SPINE; KYPHOSCOLIOSIS; SCOLIOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Congenital kyphosis due to wedge hemivertebra is an uncommon spinal deformity that could progressively develop into sagittal imbalance accompanied by subsequent neurologic deterioration if no intervention is performed. Numerous surgical techniques have been reported, since congenital kyphosis has shown no response to conservative treatments. Currently, osteotomy procedures, which are considered technically demanding and risky, have become the mainstream techniques for the correction of congenital kyphosis.
   METHODS: We describe the use of a novel surgical procedure combining forward-shifting of anterior column of the wedge hemivertebra and circumferential fusion for treatment of congenital kyphosis secondary to a wedge hemivertebra in a case of a 13-year-old boy who showed a 49 degrees angular kyphosis from T12 to L2 secondary to a wedge hemivertebra in L1.
   RESULTS: The focal kyphosis was corrected to 5 degrees with a correction rate of 89.8% after operation, and the sagittal balance was significantly preserved with no complication. Solid fusion was detected at the final follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This novel procedure, combining forward-shifting of anterior column of the wedge hemivertebra and circumferential fusion, is a feasible, effective, and safe technique for the treatment of some special type 1 congenital kyphosis cases, with a high correction rate and no major complications.

ID DECOMPRESSIVE CRANIECTOMY; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Contralateral acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is an uncommon but devastating complication during craniotomy and hematoma evacuation. It can lead to extremely poor outcomes if not treated properly and promptly.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 49-year-old male who suffered contralateral ASDH during surgical evacuation of ASDH on the left side. Before the operation, we noticed slight contralateral ASDH on preoperative cranial computed tomography and were aware of its enlargement during operation. Decompression with a burr-hole craniotomy promptly followed by a decompressive craniectomy was performed to prevent contralateral ASDH. Unfortunately, we found intraoperative brain swelling, which indicated the development of a contralateral hematoma. The patient was reoperated and eventually had a poor prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: We highlight that super-early intervention of contralateral hematoma is important to improve the prognosis of these patients.

TI Fulfilling Need for Neurosurgical Services in Sub-Saharan Africa:
   Initial Angola-Brazil Training Experience
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Africa; Angola; Brazil; Neurosurgery delivery; Neurosurgery training
AB BACKGROUND: Although Africa accounts for 15% of the global volume of neurosurgical disease, African hospitals and health care networks have access to <1% of the neurosurgeon community. Health care and neurosurgical care are particularly scarce in sub-Saharan Africa due to long periods of imperialism, civil war, poverty, and famines that have plagued the area.
   METHODS: We provide a historical perspective and initial experience of the development of neurosurgery in Angola.
   RESULTS: The Republic of Angola has the seventh largest territory in Africa and a population of approximately 29 million people; however, it has a severe deficit of neurosurgery specialists. Between 1975 and 2012, only 5 neurosurgeons practiced in the country. We report the initial experience of the first Angolan physician who completed a full neurosurgical residency in Brazil through the Hospital das Clinicas-University of Sao Paulo Medical School international medical training program. The challenges of fulfilling the need for neurosurgical services and the future perspectives of building a sustainable program in Angola are discussed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Partnerships between developing countries and sub-Saharan African countries may be the starting point in supplying neurosurgical specialists to the countries in need.

AB The pial (leptomenigeal) collateral circulation is a key determinant of functional outcome after mechanical thrombectomy after large-vessel ischemic stroke. Patients with good collateral blood flow benefit up to 24 hours after stroke onset, whereas those with poor collateral flow evidence less or no benefit. However, clues to why collateral flow varies so widely among patients have remained elusive. Recent findings in animal studies, which are currently being tested for confirmation in humans, have found that naturally occurring variants of a novel "collateral gene," Rabep2, result in large differences in the extent of anatomic collaterals and thus blood flow and infarct size in mice after stroke. The comprehension of collagerogenesis in humans and the evaluation of collateral status could aid in identifying patients who will benefit not only from mechanical thrombectomy in the extended time window but also from any reperfusion strategy. We performed a literature review focused on radiographic, clinical, and genetic aspects of the collateral circulation.

   Artery Aneurysm Clipping: A Case Report

DE Aneurysm; Clipping; Indocyanine green-video angiography; Intraoperative
   neurophysiological monitoring; Vascular neurosurgery
ID INDOCYANINE GREEN VIDEOANGIOGRAPHY; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS;
   VIDEO-ANGIOGRAPHY
AB BACKGROUND: The intraoperative use of neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) and indocyanine green video angiography (ICGVA) for aneurysm clipping have evolved during the last years. Both modalities are useful and safe by allowing greater rates of complete aneurysm occlusion with less intraoperative complications and postoperative neurologic deficits. We report a case of attempted aneurysm clipping in which the combined use of ICGVA and IONM was crucial for intraoperative decision-making.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 62-year-old woman was operated for an incidental 6-mm aneurysm at the origin of the right fronto-opercular branch. During aneurysm clipping, IONM amplitudes dropped drastically, despite patency of the parent artery and perforators in ICGVA. Several attempts for clipping were made with recurring drops in IONM amplitudes, which forced us to leave the aneurysm untreated. The patient had a postoperative left-sided hemiparesis that improved on follow-up. Thereafter, the aneurysm was treated with stent-assisted coiling.
   CONCLUSIONS: The combination of IONM and ICGVA during aneurysm surgery allows for a better assessment of vascular integrity and patient's postoperative outcome than ICGVA alone. Simultaneous evaluation of vessel patency and integrity of the somatosensory and motor pathways illustrates the complementarity of testing different modalities for intraoperative decision-making and for maximizing safeness in aneurysm clipping.

ID PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA; CEREBELLAR GLIOBLASTOMA; MULTIFORME; NERVE; RARE
AB BACKGROUND: Gliomas are usually located in the supratentorial region and are extremely rare at the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Consequently, gliomas in the CPA are easy to misdiagnose preoperatively.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This paper presents a 55-year-old man with an extraaxial CPA glioblastoma arising from the proximal portion of cranial nerve (CN) VIII. Preoperative imaging findings suggested an acoustic neuroma. The tumor was removed subtotally, and it was completely separated from the brainstem and cerebellum. The histopathologic examination showed a glioblastoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this case is the second report of a true primary extraaxial CPA glioblastoma. Therefore glioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CPA masses with atypical imaging features, although they are extremely rare.

DE Bow hunter syndrome; Case report; Pseudoaneurysm; Rotational vertebral
   artery occlusion
ID VERTEBRAL ARTERY-OCCLUSION; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Bow hunter syndrome describes a mechanical compression of the vertebral artery on head rotation leading to reversible symptomatic vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Patients are commonly presenting with syncope, vertigo, dizziness, and visual disturbances. These symptoms usually resolve when the head is turned back into neutral position. Treatment options involve surgical decompression with or without fusion, bypass surgery, or endovascular intervention.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report about a 49-year-old female who presented with vague neck pain and severe vertigo, nausea, and near syncope when her head turned up and right. Computed tomography angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm at the dominant left V3 and near total occlusion of the left vertebral artery as it exited the C2 foramen when the head was turned to the previously mentioned position. The patient could be successfully treated by computed tomography-navigated posterior instrumentation using bilateral C1 lateral mass screws and C2 translaminar screws. To promote segmental fusion, bilateral intrafacet cages were implanted. Postoperatively, the patient remained without neurologic deficits and experienced no further episodes of the preoperatively reported transient vertebrobasilar insufficiency symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: The reported case is unique as the bow hunter syndrome was further complicated by a pseudoaneurysm of the V3 segment. Surgical intervention proved to be an efficient treatment by stabilizing the affected segment in this patient.

ID SUCCESSFUL RECONSTRUCTION; CLOSURE
AB INTRODUCTION: Normal skull base structures are destroyed either by the skull base pathology itself or during surgery that results in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Skull base repair is usually performed transnasally by using a nasal septal flap. But when NSF is not available and failed repeated transnasal repair, a cranionasal repair with frontal pericranial flap (PF) can be attempted to achieve the highest successful chance. We performed a dual layer/split PF repair of a skull base defect using cranionasal approach and here we describe the technique.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old man suffered from CSF leak and ventriculitis after multiple transnasal surgeries for pituitary macroadenoma despite multiple repairs with intranasal vascularized flaps. We performed repair by cranionasal approach and using frontal PF. The frontal PF was divided into left and right halves. The left half went intradural, through the chiasmatic window to reach the sella and cover the tubercular and sellar defect from above. The right half went through the nasion into the nose to cover the defect from below. So the defect was covered by two vascularized flap from a single frontal PF. The repair was successful with no CSF leak and infection successfully treated by antibiotics.
   CONCLUSION: We introduced the cranionasal dual layer/split PF technique to repair anterior skull base and successfully stopped the CSF leak in a patient after multiple EEA surgeries. This technique should only be considered in specific difficult situation where usual repair by EEA is impossible.

AB The Nuremberg Trials were a sequence of tribunal sessions held by the Allied Forces between November 1945 and October 1946 with the intent of prosecuting prominent representatives of the Nazi Party for crimes committed before and during the war. Because medical experiments in human prisoners were among the most heinous offenses, a specific series of court cases, known as the Doctor's Trials (the USA vs. Karl Brandt et al), was carried out. A considerable part of the official documents of the Nuremberg Trials has been recently made publicly available through the Nuremberg Trials Project, an initiative of the Harvard Law School Library. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the Doctors' Trials original documents (NMT 1: Medical Case) as well as other available academic and historical sources focusing on references to the nervous system, neurosurgical, and neurologic diseases. Besides providing a brief glance of a unique source of original historical documents, this historical vignette also attempts to fulfill, at least in some limited sense, the moral duty toward the Holocaust victims laid on our generation by remembering their fate.

ID HYPERTROPHIC OLIVARY DEGENERATION
AB BACKGROUND: The occurrence of isolated fourth ventricle and injury to the Guillain-Mollaret triangle in the setting of posterior fossa ependymoma represents a new association. In this case report, we discuss the clinical, theoretical, and therapeutic aspects of this problem. We describe a lateral transcerebellar trajectory and shunt valve configuration for safe fourth ventricle shunting in a patient with prior posterior fossa surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman underwent subtotal resection of a fourth ventricle ependymoma (World Health Organization grade III) followed by radiation therapy to control the residual tumor. Her course was complicated by a cerebral abscess and subsequent communicating hydrocephalus, for which she received a lateral ventriculoperitoneal shunt. After placement of the lateral ventricle shunt, there was a progressive increase in the volume of the fourth ventricle over the next 2 years, from 2.5 to 12.0 mL. She developed palatal myoclonus, hand incoordination, bilateral foot numbness, and progressive ataxia. Neuroimaging also revealed hypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olivary nuclei bilaterally. The isolated fourth ventricle was treated by a separate fourth ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted through a lateral transcerebellar trajectory. A programmable variable pressure valve was implemented.
   CONCLUSIONS: Development of an isolated fourth ventricle and injury to the Guillain-Mollaret triangle in the setting of fourth ventricular ependymoma is a newly encountered complication. Choice of treatment modality and timing of intervention should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. The data presented in this report may assist in the selection of surgical treatment for isolated fourth ventricle.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endoscope; Fat globules; Supraorbital; Teratoma
ID CHILDHOOD
AB BACKGROUND: Primary intracranial teratomas account for <1% of intracranial masses during childhood after infancy. When supratentorial, they commonly occur in the pineal and suprasellar regions, demonstrating multilocularity, areas of fat, and calcifications and increasing enhancement correlating with decreased maturity. However, the presence of a teratoma as a mobile fat lesion within a large unilocular suprasellar cyst is rarely documented in this patient population.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the first pediatric case of a suprasellar mature teratoma presenting as a mobile fat suppressing lesion within a large unilocular suprasellar cyst and describe a supraorbital approach with adjunctive use of the endoscope for resection. We also provide a literature review of other cases presenting with similar radiographic findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mature teratomas may manifest atypically as unilocular cystic lesions with a central mobile fatty component and are treated by gross total surgical resection. The supraorbital approach with adjunctive use of an endoscope can provide adequate exposure for resection with optimal cosmetic outcome.

TI Huge Greater Superficial Petrosal Nerve Schwannoma with Intradural
   Peritumoral Cyst
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Greater superficial petrosal nerve; Peritumoral cyst; Schwannoma
ID TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: Schwannoma originating from the greater superficial petrosal nerve is an extremely rare type of facial nerve schwannoma located in the middle cranial fossa around the midportion of the petrous bone. Here, we provide the first report of greater superficial petrosal nerve schwannoma presenting with contralateral facial palsy and hemiparesis due to compression of the pyramidal tract by associated intradural peritumoral cyst.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of gradually worsening gait unsteadiness. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a well-defined tumor occupying the right middle cranial fossa and extending into the tympanic cavity. Notably, the tumor accompanied a large cyst in the intradural space, resulting in a leftward midline shift. Extradural exploration through thinned periosteal dura mater revealed the tumor within the interdural space. After debulking of most of the tumor in a pull-out, piecemeal fashion, intradural exploration revealed the peritumoral cyst located between the meningeal dura mater and brain parenchyma. Following the disappearance of the mass effect from the tumor, fenestration of the peritumoral cyst, which had been deeper-seated than the tumor, was easily achieved while avoiding excessive retraction of the temporal lobe. Postoperatively, mild left hemiparesis involving the face resolved completely and no new symptoms such as right facial palsy, hearing disturbance, or xerophthalmia developed as postoperative complications.
   CONCLUSION: The combination of extradural and intradural approaches in the appropriate order is essential for fenestration of an intradural peritumoral cyst along with removal of an interdural tumor.

ID PEDICLE SCREW FIXATION; AXIS; NAVIGATION; COMPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT;
   ACCURACY; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic spondylolisthesis or hangman's fracture is a common cervical spine fracture. Most cases of traumatic spondylolisthesis are treated nonoperatively with external immobilization. The indications for surgery have generally included fracture instability or failed nonoperative management. Operative stabilization can be performed through either anterior or posterior approaches and has generally required instrumentation using open methods. We propose a technique for surgical repair of hangman's fracture that is minimally invasive and motion preserving using recent advances in 3-dimensional image-guidance technology. We believe this method represents another option in the treatment of hangman's fractures, because it allows for immediate stabilization, prompt recovery, and quick mobilization.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of 2 patients with hangman's fractures who had undergone surgical unilateral transfixation with minimally invasive percutaneous screw placement. In both cases, we used 3-dimensional neuronavigation and bidirectional intraoperative fluoroscopy. The operative time from incision to closure was <30 minutes. Preparation and positioning after intubation varied from 40 to 150 minutes. No intraoperative complications occurred. Both patients were discharged within 48 hours postoperatively. The follow-up examinations at 3 months, 12 months, and 5 years revealed healthy bony fusion on computed tomography imaging and an excellent clinical recovery.
   CONCLUSION: We have provided 2 examples in which minimally invasive unilateral fixation of hangman's fractures proved to be safe and effective. In both cases, the patients were immediately relieved of their pain, quickly mobilized, and promptly discharged. The achievement of successful fusion confirmed at the follow-up examinations.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a huge mass lesion in the bilateral gluteal regions and multiple metastatic chordomas. Colostomy and wide en bloc excision of the giant recurrent chordoma were performed in April 2017. The tumor weighed 13.15 kg, and histopathologic examination revealed a chordoma. Magnetic resonance imaging performed at the 12-month follow-up showed slight recurrence. In addition, multiple metastatic chordomas localized to the pelvic cavity and the subcutaneous layer of the gluteal region showed significant enlargement. The metastatic chordomas were resected in May 2018. At his last follow-up, the patient presented with an indwelling catheter and a colostomy bag, and the recurrent chordoma showed no visible enlargement.

ID ARTERY; THROMBUS; STROKE; CALCIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; MECHANISMS;

AB BACKGROUND: A mobile carotid plaque can be detected by duplex ultrasonography and is a high-risk factor for embolic stroke.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We herein present a case involving an 80-year-old man with an asymptomatic carotid floating flap diagnosed by duplex ultrasonography and treated with carotid endarterectomy. Intraoperatively, an ulceration was found immediately proximal to the neck of the floating flap, and the shape and size of the ulceration were quite similar to those of the floating flap. In a histopathologic examination of the specimen resected by carotid endarterectomy, the plaque lacked the internal elastic lamina (IEL) at the ulceration, calcification was observed in the plaque and medial layer at the ulceration, and the floating flap consisted of the IEL accompanied by calcification, fibrin, and foamy cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: Progression of the atheroma and Monckeberg sclerosis might have affected disruption of the IEL, causing the IEL to finally peel off. A floating intimal flap accompanied by an atheroma without intraplaque hemorrhage is a rare cause of mobile plaque formation. This type of mobile plaque might not be dissolved by medical treatment alone. In such cases, surgical treatment is a suitable therapeutic choice to prevent stroke.

DE Coil; LVIS Jr.; Stent; Superior cerebellar artery aneurysm
ID POSTERIOR CIRCULATION
AB BACKGROUND: Superior cerebellar artery (SCA) aneurysm arising from the SCA itself is rare, and treatment of this aneurysm is challenging because of the important anatomic structures, such as the perforating arteries to the brainstem and cranial nerves. We describe a successful coil embolization with a Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support Junior (LVIS Jr.) stent for the proximal SCA dissecting aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old woman presented with right oculomotor nerve palsy and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed a dissecting wide neck aneurysm at the anterior pontomesencephalic segment of the right SCA (diameter 1 mm). The patient was treated with coiling assisted by an LVIS Jr. stent. Postoperative angiography demonstrated a complete embolized aneurysm and parent artery preservation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment assisted with LVIS Jr. stent for proximal SCA dissecting aneurysm arising from small parent artery was safely and effectively feasible.

ID SURGICAL TECHNIQUE; SPINE; INSTRUMENTATION
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical stabilization of thoracic spine fractures is recommended for unstable patterns, yet much debate exists regarding the best approach for reduction. The aim of this article was to report the outcome of a novel method for stabilization of a fish-mouth thoracic spine fracture.
   METHODS: A retrospective patient chart review was conducted. Data collected included blood loss, operative time, length of stay, perioperative complications, neurologic deficits, and secondary procedures. The patient underwent percutaneous reduction of a hyperextension injury to the thoracic spine. Sufficient reduction was achieved through a percutaneous approach, followed by sequential distraction of 1 rod with sequential locking of the contralateral rod to maintain deformity correction. Electrophysiologic monitoring was used during the procedure.
   RESULTS: Sufficient fracture reduction was achieved and evaluated on postoperative computed tomography. Operative time was 145 minutes, and estimated blood loss was 120 mL. There were no cerebrospinal fluid leaks, iatrogenic neurologic deficits, implant failures, other systemic events or revisions during the 8-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This article describes the feasibility of using a novel model for reduction and stabilization of fish-mouth thoracic spine fracture with minimal soft tissue violation.

AB BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) of the posterior spinal element is an uncommon condition. In a developed country its diagnosis is becoming difficult due to low incidence.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old lady presented with low back pain and right leg pain for 6 months. On examination there was tenderness over L4 and L5, a positive straight leg raise test at 70 degrees on the right side and free on the left, and sensory involvement on the right L5 dermatome.
   Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an L4-5 ligamentum flavum cyst, high signal intensity in the right pedicle and facet joint. It was considered to be a degenerative spinal disorder. Later MRI showed increased size of the cyst, and computed tomography revealed erosion of the right pedicle of the L5 vertebrae, which raised the suspicion of the tubercular pathology.
   Initially the patient was managed for a degenerative spinal disorder. Later, when tubercular pathology was suspected, she underwent full endoscopic uniportal stenosis decompression and excision biopsy of the cyst. The histology of the cyst revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with central necrosis. The diagnosis of a TB cyst was confirmed, and antitubercular therapy was started.
   CONCLUSION: TB of the posterior elements of the spine is a diagnostic challenge in developed parts of the world. We describe the first likely case of tubercular ligamentum flavum cyst, which was managed by a full endoscopic uniportal approach.

TI Intractable Repeated Intracerebral Hemorrhage Due to Primary Dural
   Leiomyosarcoma: Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Dura mater; Leiomyosarcoma; Venous thrombosis
ID EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; INTRACRANIAL LEIOMYOSARCOMA
AB BACKGROUND: There are few case reports of primary leiomyosarcoma originating from the dura mater. We herein report a case of primary dural leiomyosarcoma that presented with repeated intracranial hemorrhage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 62-year-old man presented with a 4-year history of a temporo-occipital bump. He showed a disturbance with reading words. The sudden onset of occipitalgia occurred 13 days after the onset. Computed tomography revealed a left temporal subcortical hematoma and thin subacute subdural hematoma associated with a temporal osteolytic mass lesion extending into the subcutaneous layer. The hematoma and tumorous mass lesion were removed. The subcutaneous tumor mass penetrating the skull bone originated from the dura mater and extended into the transverse sinus. No invasion into the cortical surface was observed. The lesion adjacent to the transverse sinus was not resected, and the remnant lesion was irradiated with local radiation therapy of 60 Gy. A left subdural hematoma and intrasylvian subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred 3 months after the first surgery, and a second removal was performed. Temporal subcortical hemorrhage repeatedly occurred 2 months after the second surgery, and the patient died.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the present case, primary dural leiomyosarcoma may have invaded the dural sinus and repeated intracranial hemorrhage occurred due to a venous circulatory disturbance. The aggressive clinical course observed is rare. A clearer understanding of the route of invasion and a careful evaluation after primary treatment are needed in order to avoid hemorrhagic complications.

ID SYNDROME TYPE-IV; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; COIL EMBOLIZATION; NERVE
   PALSY; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is a vascular disease associated with a genetic collagen abnormality. It is characterized by vessel fragility, vessel rupture, and massive hemorrhage. Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) is the most frequent neurovascular complication of vEDS. However, CCF treatment using conventional diagnostic angiography and neuro-endovascular therapy can result in a high rate of major complications.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a right CCF in a 48-year-old man with vEDS. The carotid artery and jugular vein were exposed by direct neck dissection. To avoid systemic vascular complications, multiple catheters were inserted into the shunt segment via the carotid artery and jugular vein. This transarterial and transvenous multidevice technique enabled compact placement of coils in the shunt segment. The CCF was eliminated via selective shunt occlusion. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed occlusion of the right CCF.
   CONCLUSIONS: Selective shunt occlusion via a transarterial and transvenous multidevice technique is a useful and safe approach for treating vEDS-associated CCF.

DE EC-IC bypass; Giant aneurysm; Intraoperative test occlusion; Outcome
ID BALLOON TEST OCCLUSION; MANAGEMENT; REVASCULARIZATION; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: There is still a controversy for low-flow extracranial-intracranial or high-flow extracranial-intracranial bypass with proximal occlusion in the treatment of unclippable giant internal carotid artery aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 61-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of double vision. Neuroimages revealed an unclippable giant internal carotid artery aneurysm located from the cavernous sinus to proximal site of the posterior communicating artery. Ipsilateral A1 of the anterior cerebral artery was hypoplastic, and posterior communicating artery was patent. Intraoperative proximal test occlusion at cervical internal carotid artery under neurophysiological monitoring, instead of preoperative balloon test occlusion, was performed to assess whether low-flow bypass was sufficient. The monitoring was unchanged during test occlusion, and the aneurysm was successfully trapped without high-flow bypass. Neither ischemic lesion nor neurologic deficits were found postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative proximal test occlusion is useful to decide on the surgical procedure of revascularization in patients with unclippable internal carotid aneurysm.

   CLASSIFICATION; MALFORMATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) occurring in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) region are difficult to cure. Endovascular treatment (EVT) is an effective method for the treatment of SSS region DAVFs. Currently, no systematic review of EVT for SSS region DAVFs is available. A systematic review of the literature is necessary.
   METHODS: A systematic PubMed search for studies related to SSS region DAVFs published after 1990 in English was performed on October 15, 2018.
   RESULTS: Thirty-three studies involving 42 patients, including 31 (73.8%, 31/42) men, were finally identified. Of the 42 patients, 12 (28.6%, 12/42) patients mainly presented with intracranial hemorrhage, and 9 (21.4%, 9/42) patients presented with cognitive impairment. Of the 42 patients, 31 (73.8%, 31/42) patients were treated via transarterial embolization, and 11 (26.2%, 11/42) patients were treated via transvenous embolization. Of the 42 patients, 41 (97.6%, 41/42) patients had a clear angiographic outcome, and complete angiographic cure was achieved in 36 (87.8%, 36/41) patients. Of the 42 patients, 4 (9.5%, 4/42) patients were reported to have procedural complications. Of the 42 patients, 37 (88.1%, 37/42) patients had a definite description of the follow-up outcome, 22 (59.5%, 22/37) patients had a modified Ranking Scale score of 0, and 12 (32.4%, 12/37) patients had an improved neurologic state.
   CONCLUSIONS: In treating SSS region DAVFs, EVT can completely obliterate the fistula point and correct venous shunting. Thus, currently EVT is an effective treatment for SSS region DAVFs. Although many complications can occur, this approach achieves good outcomes in most cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Upper thoracic myelopathy caused by combined ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is relatively rare. This clinical condition is difficult to treat, and a surgical method has not been fully established. We report an extremely rare case of severe thoracic myelopathy caused by concurrent beak-type OPLL and OLF at T1-T2.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old woman with paresthesia of both legs and an inability to hold a standing position presented to our hospital. Radiological images showed a large beak-type OPLL at T1-T2 and an OLF at T1-T7. The spinal cord was severely compressed at T1-T2. First, posterior decompression and instrumentation fusion at C6-T4 was performed, with a T1-T2 bilateral parallel gutter along the dural tube into the vertebral bodies covering the extent of the OPLL. Second, anterior decompression of the OPLL with corpectomy of T1-T2 and fusion using iliac bone grafting was performed after the sternal manubrium splitting approach. In the deep operating field of the second surgery, the gutters created during the first surgery were helpful for judging the width and thickness of the OPLL during the anterior decompression procedure. Postoperatively, her neurological symptoms greatly improved, the patient could walk independently, and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score had improved from 3 preoperatively to 8 at the final follow-up examination at 16 months postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Two-stage circumferential decompression and fusion surgery can be considered an effective surgical method for upper thoracic concurrent OPLL and OLF. The bilateral gutters created during the first surgery improved the safety and feasibility of this difficult operation.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Dermoid cyst; Fat; Spontaneous rupture
AB BACKGROUND: Central nervous system dermoid cysts are rare lesions derived from ectopic epithelial cells. They are slow-growing benign tumors but may cause significant morbidity through compression of neurologic and vascular structures and, rarely, rupture into the subarachnoid space.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a rare case of a spontaneously ruptured intracranial dermoid cyst in a 32-year-old man presenting as new-onset epileptic seizures due to chemical meningitis caused by dissemination of fat or lipid droplets.
   CONCLUSIONS: The dermoid cyst is a rare entity, the rupture of which is exceptional and often spontaneous. It is manifested by a polymorphic and nonspecific clinical picture requiring the use of imaging. This is based on CT and especially MRI, which make it possible to positively diagnose the nature of the cyst and the rupture, specify the extent of the dissemination of the lipid content in the subarachnoid spaces, and detect possible complications such as hydrocephalus. It also makes it possible to carry out a precise topographic assessment to plan the therapeutic conduct and guide a possible surgical intervention.

ID CARDIAC MYXOMA; CARCINOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Neoplastic cerebral aneurysms are exceedingly rare. We describe a case of a ruptured, distal middle cerebral artery aneurysm as the presenting symptom leading to the identification of metastatic lung cancer.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient underwent an uncomplicated surgical trapping and ligation of the aneurysm. Histopathologic examination of the aneurysm confirmed the neoplastic cerebral aneurysm was due to a metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features. The patient subsequently underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the resection cavity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neoplastic cerebral aneurysms are rare, and there are insufficient data to support specific guidelines for management. This case is novel as the patient received adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery to the operative bed, as well as systemic chemotherapy, and has maintained good functional status as of last follow-up at 6 months.

ID HEARING-LOSS; BONE; PREVALENCE; COMPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a rare bony defect in the petrosal temporal bone, creating a new opening between the inner ear and middle cranial fossa. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by a defect in collagen synthesis. Patients with EDS are more likely to have bony abnormalities, which may pre-dispose them to developing SSCD.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the cases of 2 women with history of EDS hypermobility type (HT). Both patients presented with bilateral auditory and vestibular symptoms, and computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of bilateral dehiscence in their superior semicircular canals. They underwent elective surgical repair via middle fossa craniotomy and report improvement in their symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of the rarity of both diseases and their pathophysiology, a history of EDS may predispose an individual to developing SSCD. Although further research is necessary, this report aims to improve clinical screening of patients with EDS HT by suggesting an auditory and vestibular evaluation and assessment of pertinent bony abnormalities.

DE Hemangioblastoma; PICA aneurysm; Retromedullary vascular lesion
ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CLINICAL-FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Hemangioblastomas (HBMs) are benign vascular neoplasms that most commonly arise within the cerebellum. Although other vascular lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis, HBMs rarely resemble aneurysms on neuroimaging and only 1 case of a cerebellar HBM mimicking a posterior fossa aneurysm has been reported. Here we describe a retromedullary HBM that masqueraded as a distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) medullary branch aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old asymptomatic male was incidentally diagnosed with an unruptured 3-mm left PICA aneurysm via computed tomography angiography during a workup for carotid stenosis. Two years later, the presumed aneurysm enlarged to 6.5 mm and prompted elective treatment. Endovascular treatment was unsuccessful, and the patient was immediately transitioned to a craniotomy for aneurysm clipping. After microsurgical dissection, the lesion was visualized on the posterior medullary surface with several small arterial feeders extending from the brainstem into the aneurysm dome, but no major parent vessel was observed. Because a clip could not be safely applied to these small vessels, they were instead coagulated and the lesion was completely resected. Final pathology revealed hemangioblastoma (World Health Organization grade I).
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the second case of HBM mimicking a PICA aneurysm. Given the rarity of PICA medullary branch aneurysms and their highly symptomatic nature, other etiologies, especially HBM, should be strongly considered when an apparent distal PICA aneurysm is diagnosed in an asymptomatic patient. If the lesion is unamenable to endovascular treatment, there should be high suspicion for HBM and subsequent craniotomy should be pursued.

TI Cost-Effectiveness of a Radio Frequency Hemostatic Sealer (RFHS) in
   Adult Spinal Deformity Surgery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cost-effectiveness; Radiofrequency hemostatic sealer; Spine deformity
   surgery
ID BLOOD-TRANSFUSION; BIPOLAR SEALER; ARTHROPLASTY; PROGRAM; US
AB BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion surgery can lose a substantial amount of blood. This can prolong operative time and require transfusion of allogeneic blood components, which increases the risk of infection and can be the harbinger of serious complications. Does a saline-irrigated bipolar radiofrequency hemostatic sealer (RFHS) help reduce transfusion requirements?
   METHODS: In an observational cohort study, we compared transfusion requirements in 30 patients undergoing surgery for adult spinal deformity using the RFHS with that of a historical control group of 30 patients in which traditional hemostasis was obtained with bipolar electrocautery and matched them for blood loss-related variables. Total expense to the hospital for the RFHS, laboratory expenses, and blood transfusions was used for cost calculations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated using the number of blood transfusions avoided as the effectiveness payoff.
   RESULTS: Using a multivariable linear regression model, we found that only estimated blood loss (EBL) was an independent significant predictor of transfusion requirement in both groups. We evaluated the variables of age, EBL, time duration of surgery, preoperative hemoglobin, hemoglobin nadir during surgery, body mass index, length of stay, and number of levels operated on. Mean EBL was greater in the control group (2201 vs. 1416 mL, P = 0.0099). The number of transfusions also was greater in the control group (14.5 vs. 6.5, P = 0.0008). In the cost-effectiveness analysis, we found that the RFHS cost $108 more (compared with not using the RFHS) to avoid 1 unit of blood transfusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that if we are willing to pay $108 to avoid 1 unit of blood transfusion, the use of the RFHS is a reasonable choice to use in open surgery for adult spinal deformity.

AB BACKGROUND: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a nonsurgical mapping technique used in mapping of motor and language eloquent areas within and/or surrounding brain tumors. Previous reports support this as a safe technique with minor side effects associated with minor headaches and discomfort around the stimulation area. Currently there are no published reports concerning the accuracy and safety of this procedure in patients with a titanium cranioplasty in situ.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old lady was diagnosed with a recurrent glioma in the context of increasing seizure frequency, left-sided numbness, and weakness. She was diagnosed with a World Health Organization grade 2 oli-godendroglioma 10 years before her presentation, which was initially treated with radiotherapy and then surgical resection of this lesion 5 years later. The procedure was complicated with a wound infection, treated with a craniectomy and wound washout, followed by a titanium cranioplasty. Before proceeding with surgery for recurrence, nTMS was performed for motor mapping. No complications were identified. She underwent a craniotomy for tumor resection with aminolevulinic acid HCl (Gliolan), and the tumor was completely removed. Intraoperatively, the direct cortical stimulation correlated with the preoperative nTMS. The pathologic diagnosis on recurrence was an anaplastic oligoden-droglioma grade III, and the patient is currently undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy.
   CONCLUSION: This report confirms that nTMS is a safe and accurate procedure in patients who have a titanium cranioplasty in situ.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy and safety between minimally invasive and traditional open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion in the treatment of single-level spondylolisthesis grades 1 and 2.
   METHODS: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive literature retrieval was performed in 3 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library). Randomized or nonrandomized controlled studies published from January 2000 to April 2018 that compared minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) with traditional open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TO-TLIF) for treating single-level spondylolisthesis grades 1 and 2 were retrieved. Quality of included studies were evaluated by the modified Jadad scale. Data were extracted according to the predefined clinical outcome measures, including preoperative and postoperative back pain visual analogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index score; operation time and estimated intraoperative blood loss; length of hospitalization; and the complications, reoperation, and fusion rate.
   RESULTS: Six studies (n = 394 patients) were finally included. Two were randomized controlled trials and the remaining 4 were prospective or retrospective cohort studies. The pooled data revealed that both techniques had similar preoperative and last follow-up back pain visual analogue scale scores, complication rate, reoperation rate, and fusion rate. However, with the exception of more operation time, MIS-TLIF was associated with less intraoperative blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and better long-term functional outcome when compared with TO-TLIF.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, MIS-TLIF appears to be a more efficacious and safe technique with reduced tissue trauma, quicker postoperative recovery, and better long-term functional outcome for the treatment of single-level spondylolisthesis grades 1 and 2.

TI Intracranial Actinomycosis Manifesting as a Parenchymal Mass Lesion: A
   Case Report and Review of Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Actinomycosis; Cranial; Mass lesion; Parenchymal
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial actinomycosis is a rare bacterial infection with no characteristic clinical or radiologic diagnostic features. The usual presentation is similar to pyogenic brain abscess or osteomyelitis with or without pachymeningitis. Intracranial actinomycosis rarely manifests as a parenchymal mass lesion. A high index of suspicion is warranted in a patient with immunosuppression or predisposing factors, such as dental procedure, sinusitis, cardiac septal defect, craniofacial trauma, cranial surgery, lung infection, or abdominopelvic infection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A young woman presented with a right parietal parenchymal lesion with involvement of the calvaria and pericranium. She had no predisposing factors for intracranial actinomycosis. She underwent complete microsurgical excision of the lesion followed by prolonged antibiotic therapy. She experienced a good functional recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial actinomycosis manifesting as a parenchymal mass lesion is extremely rare compared with abscess and pachymeningitis. Histopathologic examination remains the mainstay of definitive diagnosis, as culture may be negative in significant number of cases. Aggressive surgical excision with prolonged antibiotic therapy enhances the chances of a good functional outcome.

   aneurysm; Ruptured Aneurysm
ID PREVENTION; SURGERY; DEXTRAN
AB Mycotic aneurysm, also referred to as infected aneurysm, is a rare entity that may result from the bacterial infection or infective endocarditis.(1-3) The treatment options include conservative medication and endovascular or direct microsurgical intervention.(1,4,5) However, the optimal strategy remains unknown and cerebral revascularization may be required in some rare cases.(6) In this surgical video, we demonstrate a distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) mycotic aneurysm that we treated by intracranial-intracranial bypass with an interpositional graft.
   Our patient is a 53-year-old male who presented with a 6-day history of severe headache. He was subsequently admitted to our institution. Preoperative computed tomography angiography showed a left temporal hematoma (>30 mL) and an opercular segment of the MCA (M3) aneurysm, which was highly suspicious for mycotic origin. A standard frontotemporal craniotomy was carried out with preservation of superficial temporal artery (STA). Following the sylvian fissure dissection, the aneurysm was exposed with the characteristics of a thick wall and an undefinable neck, which made direct clip application difficult. The aneurysm was resected initially, and 2 cut ends were reconnected by an STA graft. Following arterial reconstruction, intraoperative Doppler revealed a patent status of the interpositional graft vessel. Postoperatively, no neurologic deficit was observed and computed tomography angiography demonstrated total elimination of the aneurysm without stenosis of the graft vessel. Low-molecular dextran was prescribed rather than aspirin, as there was concern for hemorrhage. Antibiotic treatment was used for at least 4 weeks, and the patient was transferred to the inpatient cardiology team for management of endocarditis. A 4-month follow-up angiogram showed a patent STA and excellent left distalMCA blood flow(Video 1). The favorable outcome of this case revealed that MCA-to-MCA bypass with interpositional graft is a safe, effective method for the unclippable cerebral aneurysm. As other authors have asserted, a full dose of long-term antibiotic therapy remains essential following intervention.(7) Meanwhile, dextran has proved to be a viable alternative for anticoagulation during perioperative management of bypass surgery.(8,9)

DT Review
DE Endonasal repair; Endoscopic repair; Persistent craniopharyngeal canal;
   Sphenoidal meningoencephalocele
ID CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID LEAKS; RHINORRHEA
AB BACKGROUND: A persistent craniopharyngeal canal (PCC) is a rare cause of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea in children. The condition often coexists with other midline facial defects, such as cleft palate. Children with PCC may also have pituitary dysfunction or neoplasms, such as craniopharyngiomas within the canal.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 5-year-old girl presented with bacterial meningitis and active cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea from her left nostril. Imaging showed a large nasopharyngeal meningoencephalocele, communicating with the sub-arachnoid space through a persistent craniopharyngeal canal. An endonasal approach was chosen to excise the PCC and meningoencephalocele and to repair the resulting skull base defect.
   CONCLUSIONS: The extended endonasal approach can be used to treat PCC with nasopharyngeal encephaloceles in young children. The approach is suitable to address both conditions at the same time. The extended endonasal approach avoids potentially morbid transfacial approaches and can help in earlier recovery after surgery.

TI Successful Emergent Endovascular Mechanical Thrombectomy for Pediatric

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy;
   Pediatric
ID RHEOLYTIC THROMBECTOMY; OCCLUSION; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a relatively uncommon cause of stroke in pediatric patients and young adults. The clinical course of CVST is also highly variable. In particular, coma has been noted as a predictor of poor outcome. The standard treatment for CVST in adults is systemic anticoagulation, which can lead to recanalization. Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EMT) is considered as possibly indicated in the event of failure to respond to anticoagulation or a comatose state. However, the role of endo-vascular therapy in the management of pediatric and young adult CVST is unclear. Here, we describe 3 cases of successful emergent EMT for pediatric and young adult CVST presenting in a comatose state.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 17-year-old boy presented with rapid deterioration and a comatose state despite anticoagulation using heparin. Emergent EMT was performed for CVST. Balloon percutaneous transmural angioplasty and catheter aspiration were repeatedly performed, and partial recanalization of the superior sagittal sinus was achieved by the end of the procedure. The child was discharged without neurologic deficits. Another 2 comatose cases with CVST underwent emergent EMT with balloon percutaneous transmural angioplasty and catheter aspiration, and partial recanalization was again achieved. These patients finally showed complete superior sagittal sinus recanalization and were discharged without neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSION: Pediatric and young comatose CVST warrants endovascular mechanical thrombectomy as soon as possible.

DE Cranioplasty exposure; Forehead flap; Infection; Skin fistula
ID BASE
AB BACKGROUND: Infection and skin fistula are well-known complications after cranioplasty leading to reconstruction exposure and usually requiring new surgical procedure with poor condition for cutaneous closure. We describe 2 cases using muscle forehead flap (MFF) to treat skin fistula and cranioplasty exposure.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The first case was a 43-year-old man who underwent a calvarial bone graft of the frontal sinus anterior wall after craniofacial trauma. Three months postoperatively, osteitis of the bone reconstruction and a skin fistula occurred in the median frontal region. The second case was a 37-year-old woman treated for a cingular glioblastoma by 3 surgeries, concomitant chemoradiation therapy, and frontal reconstruction using a titanium plate. She presented a plate exposure associated with cerebrospinal fluid leak and meningitis. Both patients were successfully treated by surgical removal of the frontal cranioplasty and skin closure using MFF. We observed a satisfying cosmetic result with no recurrence of infection or fistula at 12 and 4 months, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: MFF is a surgical option to treat complex cases of cutaneous fistula secondary to cranioplasty exposure of the anterior cranial fossa.

   Neuroendovascular treatment; Severe calcification; Stent deformation
ID ANGIOPLASTY; PREVALENCE; FRACTURES
AB BACKGROUND: Despite the development of neuroendovascular treatment, device-related complications requiring surgical procedures remain. We report a case requiring surgical retrieval of a filter protection device in carotid artery stenting (CAS) with an open-cell stent, due to stent deformation, and review past reports on CAS in which surgical retrieval of devices was required.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 82-year-old man underwent CAS for symptomatic right internal carotid artery stenosis with severe calcification and tortuosity. Immediately after placement of the open-cell stent, stent deformation was detected and the filter protection device could not be retrieved. All noninvasive device retrieval attempts failed, and the device was ultimately retrieved surgically. After surgery, right cerebral infarction progressed increased, but no permanent deficit was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: As the treatment of cerebrovascular disease shifts from surgical to endovascular approaches, surgeons must be familiar with devices and techniques to manage complications of neuroendovascular treatment.

ID INTRAOPERATIVE ANAPHYLAXIS; MATRIX; SEALANT
AB OBJECTIVE: To present an alternative cost-effective hemostatic agent ( HA) for cranial surgery and to describe the technique to produce it.
   METHODS: This HA has been used in 3 reference centers over the last year during 230 procedures, including different types of pathology, such as skull base, oncology, vascular, and trauma, either for endoscopic or open approaches. This agent was made from a low-cost and worldwide-available gelatin foam which was mixed with saline solution in 2 syringes and connected by a 3-way stopcock, making a useful hemostatic paste.
   RESULTS: The cost was 16 and 28 times less than SURGIFLO and FLOSEAL, respectively. The mean time to prepare the mix was 4 minutes. It was very effective for venous and low-flow bleeding.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presented technique offers a reliable and cost-effective way of achieving hemostasis in cranial surgery, therefore allowing hospitals with limited resources to perform advanced procedures in a safer way.

   DIAGNOSIS; TUMOR; PROGRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Meningeal melanoma is a rare tumor of the central nervous system, whose amelanotic variant is called "amelanotic meningeal melanoma" (AMM). AMM does not produce melanin and therefore does not exhibit typical short T1 and short T2 signal on magnetic resonance imaging and thus can be easily misdiagnosed and be inappropriately managed. To date, only 4 AMM cases have been reported in the English literature. Here, we report the fifth case.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old female patient presented with a 4-month history of progressive headache and nausea, the conventional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a posterior fossa mass accompanied by diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. Repeated cerebrospinal fluid cytology screening showed negative results. The functional magnetic resonance examinations, including diffusion-weighted imaging, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging, provided complementary information. The final diagnosis of AMM was made by immunohistochemistry. Despite gross total excision of the tumor, the disease progressed, and the patient died 10 months after diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with this case demonstrated that meningeal melanoma should be included in the differential diagnosis when an intracranial mass is accompanied by leptomeningeal dissemination, and especially when proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging indicate a malignant tumor whereas diffusion-weighted imaging does not. And the loss of a typical melanin signal should not server as an excluding criterion for meningeal melanoma.

TI Utility of Single Fenestrated Miniclip in Management of Small Cerebral
   Aneurysm: Technical Report of 2 Cases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm; Clipping; Fenestrated miniclip
AB BACKGROUND: Fenestrated miniclips were developed as an effective tool for dog-ear-shaped remnants of aneurysms. However, the special property of these clips may have other applications. Here, we report 2 cases of ruptured small aneurysm and suggest the alternative utility of a single application of a fenestrated miniclip.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 77-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to an anterior communicating aneurysm. The aneurysm was treated with surgical clipping via a right pterional approach. Because dissection of tight adhesion between the aneurysm and ipsilateral A2 might cause intraoperative bleeding, the angled fenestrated miniclip was applied across the ipsilateral A2 without dissection of adhesion and obliterated the aneurysm without complications. In another case, a 60-year-old man presented with sub-arachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured vertebral artery-posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm and was treated with surgical clipping via a far-lateral approach. Because aneurysm visualization was impeded by PICA even after mobilization of the PICA and vertebral artery, a fenestrated standard-clip was applied across the PICA. However, this clip impeded visualization of the aneurysm and could not be opened in the tight surgical field. In contrast, subsequent application of a fenestrated miniclip allowed better visualization of the aneurysm, even in a tight field, and resulted in successful obliteration of the aneurysm.
   CONCLUSION: Single application of fenestrated miniclips may be suitable in cases of small aneurysms with thin walls adhering to branch vessels or where visualization of the aneurysm is impeded by the parent artery.

ID WOMEN; RECRUITMENT; SURGERY; EXPOSURE; CAREER; TRENDS; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: Since 2011, more women than men have graduated from medical school, yet there remains a paucity of female physicians in surgical specialties. After the 2018 Neurosurgery Match, only 17.5% of neurosurgery residents are women. Previous literature documented gender inequality, poor medical school exposure, and lack of female mentorship as reasons for this disparity. We sought to further explore factors that deter female medical students from pursuing neurosurgery.
   METHODS: A comprehensive survey was created and distributed to the 2017-2018 Rutgers New Jersey Medical School student body, requesting anonymous input from female medical students.
   RESULTS: Of 104 female respondents, 26.9% had considered neurosurgery as a career and felt dissuaded because of their gender. Of respondents, 88% did not have a senior female medical student pursuing neurosurgery or a female neurosurgical resident as a mentor. More than half of respondents disagreed that they would be dissuaded from a field if they did not have a female mentor. The 88.46% of women who felt that there was a glass ceiling in medicine were also more likely to feel that they would face inequality and adversity that would inhibit training in a male-dominated field. Women who described themselves as seeking challenging and competitive careers strongly felt that they would benefit from exposure to surgical subspecialties during their preclinical years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Female medical students remain resilient, ambitious, interested in competitive specialties, and eager to explore surgical subspecialties during preclinical years. A multifaceted approach is imperative to recruit and retain qualified women interested in neurosurgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Improving value in healthcare means optimizing outcomes and minimizing costs. The emerging pay-for-performance era requires understanding of the effect of healthcare services on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Pediatric and surgical subspecialties have yet to fully integrate HRQoL measures into practice. The present study reviewed and characterized the HRQoL outcome measures across various pediatric neurosurgical diagnoses.
   METHODS: A literature review was performed by searching PubMed and Google Scholar with search terms such as "health-related quality of life" and "pediatric neurosurgery" and then including the specific pathologies for which a HRQoL instrument was found (e.g., "health-related quality of life" plus "epilepsy"). Each measurement was evaluated by content and purpose, relative strengths and weaknesses, and validity.
   RESULTS: We reviewed 68 reports. Epilepsy, brain tumor, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, and scoliosis were diagnoses found in reported studies that had used disease-specific HRQoL instruments. Information using general HRQoL instruments was also reported. Internal, test-retest, and/or interrater reliability varied across the instruments, as did face, content, concurrent, and/or construct validity. Few instruments were tested enough for robust reliability and validity. Significant variability was found in the usage of these instruments in clinical studies within pediatric neurosurgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The HRQoL instruments used in pediatric neurosurgery are currently without standardized guidelines and thus exhibit high variability in use. Clinicians should support the development and application of these methods to optimize these instruments, promote standardization of research, improve performance measures to reflect clinically modifiable and meaningful outcomes, and, ultimately, lead the national discussion in healthcare quality and patient-centered care.

AB BACKGROUND: We reviewed the reported data related to iatrogenic lumbar artery injury (ILAI) in spine surgery with a focus on which iatrogenic procedure might cause lumbar artery injury.
   METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in the Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and Chinese biomedical databases in July 2018.
   RESULTS: A total of 20 reports on ILAI were selected for the present study. Most of these were case reports, with a total of 26 cases. The causes of ILAI were as follows: puncture injury in 9 cases, transforaminal endoscopic operation in 5 cases, pedicle screw injury in 3 cases, intervertebral foramen decompression in 2 cases, disc rongeur injury during discectomy in 2 cases, lumbar artery tear caused by transverse process fracture in 1 case, vertebral fracture restoration in 1 case, retractor injury in 1 case, cage insertion or pedicle screw injury in 1 case, and drainage tube stimulation in 1 case. The treatment methods included transarterial embolization in 20 cases, percutaneous embolization in 2 cases, surgical ligation in 1 case, and steroid and cyclophosphamide treatment in 1 case. All patients were treated successfully. One patient died during antishock therapy, and another patient died because her family refused any further intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: Attention should be given to the surgical procedures that are likely to cause ILAI, such as percutaneous vertebroplasty/percutaneous kyphoplasty, vertebral biopsy, pedicle screw implantation, discectomy, transforaminal endoscopic operation, and intervertebral foramen decompression. Once a diagnosis of ILAI has been confirmed, selective endovascular transarterial embolization is the preferred treatment.

TI Dengue Fever Presenting with Cervicodorsal Acute Spinal Spontaneous
   Subdural Hematoma-Case Report and Review of Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Dengue; Oblique-cervical-corpectomies; Spinal-subdural-hematoma
AB BACKGROUND: Neurologic complications are increasingly being reported in dengue epidemics. Intraspinal hematomas are rare, and those associated with dengue fever are still rarer with only 1 being reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of dengue fever presenting with acute-onset quadriparesis (upper limbs Medical Research Council [MRC] 4/5 and lower limbs 0/5) and urinary incontinence. The patient was radiologically diagnosed with cervicodorsal acute to subacute anterior epidural hematoma. On the basis of clinical and radiologic evaluations, the patient underwent an anterior cervical approach via a split-manubriotomy, C6-D4 right anterolateral partial oblique corpectomies for evacuation of the hematoma. Intraoperatively, however, there was no evidence of anterior epidural collection and the dura revealed a bluish hue. A durotomy revealed a subdural hematoma. After evacuation of the hematoma, the patient remained paraplegic and her upper limb power worsened by MRC 1 grade. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed good evacuation and no new bleed; however, the intramedullary T2-weighted signal hyperintensities extending up to C2 persisted. She was on ventilatory support for almost 5 months. For diaphragmatic incapacity she underwent bilateral cervical phrenic nerve stimulation (diaphragmatic pacing). Despite initial improvement, she succumbed to multiple underlying comorbidities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Acute spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) is extremely rare but should be kept in mind in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever. The radiologic findings could be deceptive and plain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging should be used as complementary studies to establish the diagnosis of acute spontaneous SSDH. The outcomes of SSDH are guarded, and elaborate patient counseling should be done preoperatively, keeping these in perspective.

DT Review
DE Chronic low back pain; Lipomyelomeningocele; Spina bifida; Spinal cord
   stimulation; Tethered cord syndrome
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an evidence - based treatment for chronic neuropathic pain, however there is a dearth of evidence investigating this modality in patients with tethered cord syndrome (TCS).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of 55-year old woman with history of lipo-myelomeningocele repair and multiple detethering surgeries who presented with chronic low back and leg pain accompanied by progressive gait dysfunction. After a successful trial, she underwent SCS paddle lead placement that resulted in decrease of her visual analog scale (VAS) for pain from 9/10 to 0-2/10 as well as daily opioid intake from 90-199mg Morphine Equivalents Doses (MED) to 40-60mg MED. On last follow-up she reported 70-85% relief of her low back and leg pain, better ambulation, and improved quality of life.
   CONCLUSION: The literature review identified 2 other case reports of SCS in TCS with similar improvement in pain alleviation.

DT Article
DE Covered stent; Iatrogenic; Operating room; Vertebral artery injury
ID CERVICAL-SPINE SURGERY; ENDOVASCULAR EMBOLIZATION; DISKECTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Iatrogenic vertebral artery injury is an uncommon but well recognized complication during cervical spine surgery. Intraoperative surgical repair is extremely challenging and options for endovascular repair are limited due to lack of proper equipment in the operating room setting.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53 year-old female who presented with myleopathy underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion of C3-7. A significant laceration injury of left vertebral artery was encountered during surgery, which was salvaged by intraoperative, endovascular repair with a covered stent under portable fluoroscopy guidance. The salvage and repair led to the rest of the surgery to be finished as planned preoperatively without any consequences.
   CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral artery injury is an uncommon but severe complication of cervical spine surgery. For the uncontrolled bleeding, intraoperative endovascular repair with portable fluoroscopy is warranted and possible. Covered stent can seal the laceration and stop the bleeding completely which enables completion of the surgery.

DT Review
DE Coexistence; Orbital AVF; Orbital hemangioma; Treatment strategy
ID CAVERNOUS HEMANGIOMA; TRANSVENOUS EMBOLIZATION; COIL EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Orbital arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a rare entity with only 17 cases reported so far. Arteriovenous hemangioma is a distinct entity of angioma that most frequently affects the skin. However, to our knowledge, there has not been a case arising in the orbit.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy, 73-year-old man had progressive proptosis for one month. At presentation, the patient showed considerable proptosis, hyperemia in the lower eyelid, chemosis, and total ophthalmoplegia on the right side. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a round retro-orbital mass, 23 mm in maximal dimension, and lying in the inferomedial aspect of the orbit with an irregular-shaped lesion in the orbital apex. Cerebral angiography detected an orbital AVF fed by the ipsilateral maxillary and ophthalmic arteries and draining into the inferior ophthalmic vein. Stain of the retro-orbital mass was not identified. A transvenous coil embolization via the facial and superior ophthalmic veins achieved complete isolation of the AVF with satisfactory outcome. Two months later, the orbital mass, well-circumscribed and lacking perilesional hemosiderin deposition, was microsurgically resected via a lateral orbitotomy. Histological diagnosis was consistent with arteriovenous hemangioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: An AVF and arteriovenous hemangioma may simultaneously develop in the same orbit. In patients with symptomatic orbital AVF and coexisting other orbital pathology, strategies should be carefully planned before setting about the treatment.

   Supraophthalmic Aneurysm
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE ADAPT; Coil migration; Coil retrieval
AB BACKGROUND: Dislodgement of coils during endovascular embolization of brain aneurysms is a potentially hazardous complication due to high risk for cerebral infarct and subsequent neurological deficits or death. We describe a case of whole coil mesh dislodgement due to interaction between the coil loops and a temporary neck-bridging device struts and subsequent successful retrieval of a distally migrated coil into the left middle cerebral artery branch with direct aspiration technique.
   CASE DESCRIPTION : A 32-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of an unruptured wide-neck supraophthalmic aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. A temporary bridging-neck device was placed and expanded across the aneurysm neck in order to support coil deployment inside the aneurysm sac and avoid coil prolapse into the lumen of the parent vessel. Retrieval of the bridging-neck device after coil embolization resulted in whole coil mesh dislodgement due to interaction between the coil loops and the device struts and finally distal migration of a single coil into the left middle cerebral artery temporal branch. The coil was successfully retrieved using direct aspiration technique similar to thrombektomy in acute ischemic stroke. The patient did not have any neurologic deficit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our case indicates that first-line direct aspiration technique is an atraumatic and effective procedure for coil retrieval when dislodged even in distal cerebral vessels, minimizing the chance for additional retrieval technique-related risks. Interventionists should be aware of coil dislodgment as a potential temporary bridging-neck device-related complication.

   cervical corpectomy; Spine metastasis; Spine tumor; Thyroid carcinoma
ID RESECTION; CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spine metastases with circumferential spinal cord compression are often treated with combined anterior-posterior decompression and stabilization. In patients with large anterior neck masses, prior radiotherapy to the neck, or prior anterior neck surgery, however, anterior approaches may pose additional risk. In such cases, posterior-only approaches that allow for circumferential decompression and anterior column reconstruction may be beneficial.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a seventy-year-old male with follicular thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the cervical spine causing spinal cord compression. We utilized a posterior-only approach for a C6-C7 partial corpectomy and posterior decompression and fusion from C2 to T2. Our technique involved pre-operative embolization of the right vertebral artery to safely gain access to the ventral surface of the spinal cord and vertebral bodies. Anterior column support was provided by a chest tube/polymethylmethacrylate construct, allowing the implant to be placed within the anterior column from a posterior approach without nerve root sacrifice. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He had no post-operative neurologic deficits. Two months later he underwent a total thyroidectomy followed by stereotactic radiotherapy to the tumor bed (2700 cGy total, 3 fractions). At one-year follow-up he was active and without significant pain or focal neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel approach to ventral/circumferential cervical spine tumors that combines epidural decompression and cervical stabilization via a posterior-only approach. By using a chest tube/polymethylmethacrylate construct, anterior column support can be achieved through a posterior approach without nerve root sacrifice.

ID BRACHIAL-PLEXUS INJURY; RECONSTRUCTION
AB BACKGROUND: Intercostal-to-musculocutaneous nerve transfer is commonly performed in patients with brachial plexus avulsion injuries. As techniques have improved since its inception in 1963, most patients now experience some level of motor function improvement of their affected arm. While motor outcomes are well described, there is a paucity of literature describing sensory outcomes. It is thus difficult to gauge surgical success with respect to sensory function, and there is a necessity to share clear expectations with patients regarding intended or unintended postoperative sensation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this case report, we describe an unintended sensory outcome of this procedure. Three years after the operation, our patient experiences a "phantom sensation" on his chest when he is touched on the lateral forearm in the distribution of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. This outcome can be explained with review of the anatomy before and after the operation. The persistence of this adverse outcome suggests limitations in sensory cortical neuroplasticity.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is important to be aware of potential sensory complications in intercostal-to-musculocutaneous nerve transfer. Although this complication is known, it is often overlooked and underreported. Complications such as this should be emphasized in order to set expectations for patients and guide evaluation of sensory outcomes in future study.

DT Article
DE Approach; Functional neurosurgery; Neuropathic pain; Neurostimulation;
   Subtemporal; Trigeminal ganglion; Trigeminal neuralgia
ID NERVE-STIMULATION; NEURALGIA
AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal ganglion stimulation can be effective for trigeminal neuralgia. For patients who respond well to neurostimulation delivered percutaneously through the foramen ovale but require extensive revision and removal of instrumentation, a subtemporal approach for stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion is an alternative option as a salvage procedure.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report on a 47-year-old woman who responded well to neurostimulation for trigeminal neuropathic pain over a 1-year period from 2008 to 2009. Her preoperative pain on the numerical rating scale (NRS) was between 7 and 8 out of 10, which decreased to 2 out of 10 postoperatively. However, she developed lead migration because of a motor vehicle accident. After revision surgeries to correct this, she continued to experience pain relief until 2011. At follow-up, signs of infection prompted removal of instrumentation and subsequent return of her pain. She continued to experience persistent and severe pain (NRS score 7 of 10), which was intractable to pharmacologic treatment over 5 years. She returned in 2016 to discuss neurosurgical options, and the original approach was ruled out because of her history of lead migration, erosion, and scarring. A subtemporal approach was pursued as a salvage option, which provided several advantages for this patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: The subtemporal approach for salvage placement of the trigeminal ganglion stimulating electrode was effective in this patient and minimized risks given her history of erosion and multiple operations. This suggests that the subtemporal approach is a viable salvage operation for trigeminal ganglion stimulation for trigeminal neuropathic pain.

TI Challenges in the Management of a Ruptured Bihemispheric Posterior
   Inferior Cerebellar Artery Aneurysm
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bihemispheric posterior inferior cerebellar artery; Dissecting aneurysm;
   Endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysm; Parent vessel occlusion;
   Suboccipital craniectomy
ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; ANOMALOUS ORIGIN; PICA
AB BACKGROUND: Bihemispheric posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is a rare anatomic variant wherein a single PICA supplies both cerebellar hemispheres. Inasmuch as it is the only PICA, treatment of aneurysms arising from this anatomic variant is more complex. We present a case of a ruptured bihemispheric PICA aneurysm and the challenges encountered in its management.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old man presented with giddiness and nausea. Otherwise, he was neurologically intact. Computed tomography of the brain showed a right cerebellar hematoma and intraventricular hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography revealed a dissecting aneurysm in the retromedullary segment of a right bihemispheric PICA with a prominent saccular component. Initially, the patient refused to undergo any invasive treatment. However, when a follow-up angiogram showed an increase in the size of the aneurysm sac, he consented to treatment. Although parent vessel occlusion (PVO) was the clinical recommendation, in view of the patient's apprehensions, only the saccular component of the aneurysm was coil embolized without sacrifice of the parent vessel. Fifteen days after the coiling, there was a rebleed from this dissecting aneurysm, which was treated with PVO followed by suboccipital craniectomy. The patient made a reasonable recovery, and his modified Rankin score was 1 at his 6-month follow-up visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: In dissecting aneurysms of a bihemispheric PICA, isolated endosaccular occlusion provides uncertain protection from a rebleed, whereas a more reliable treatment with PVO carries an unpredictable risk of ischemic complications. The risks of a PVO may be rationalized as a life-saving measure; however, the subsequent threshold for posterior fossa decompression should be low.

ID MALFORMATIONS; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Pial arteriovenous fistulas (PAVFs) are rare, accounting for 1.6%-4.7% of all intracranial vascular malformations. Often diagnosed in childhood, about 30% are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. A case of PAVF diagnosed soon after birth and given cerebrovascular therapy 4 months after birth is reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient presented with heart failure immediately after birth. Ultrasonography of the head showed abnormal blood flow in the brain. On digital subtraction angiography performed 4 months after birth, a PAVF with a dural feeder shunt and a giant varix at the posterior temporal part was confirmed. After transarterial embolization (TAE), shunt blood flow disappeared. New shunt flow from the right posterior cerebral artery into the varix was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging 3 months after the operation. A second TAE procedure using a liquid embolic material was performed and confirmed the complete disappearance of the shunt.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report describes a case of infant PAVF with heart failure, a giant varix, hydrocephalus, and intraventricular hemorrhage treated by TAE using platinum coils and liquid embolic material.

   fixation; Surgical treatment
ID JUVENILE MUSCULAR-ATROPHY; SPINAL-CORD
AB BACKGROUND: Hirayama disease (HD) is a rare disease traditionally treated with nonsurgical procedures. Surgical treatment, which is performed by decompression and/or fusion of the cervical spine, is generally considered for rapidly progressive or advanced cases, and the choice of surgical technique is debatable. We describe the first severe case of HD that was successfully treated by posterior lateral mass screw fixation without decompression or fusion.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 17-year-old adolescent boy who presented with progressive symptoms bilaterally with an unsatisfactory history of conservative treatment. We performed posterior lateral mass screw fixation without decompression or fusion and removed the internal fixation after 4 years of follow-up. Symptom remission and imaging performance improvement were achieved, and the stability and range of motion of the cervical spine were maintained.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nondecompression and nonfusion surgery was successful and achieved satisfactory results in this case; therefore, it serves as a promising candidate for the surgical treatment of HD.

AB INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is a newer imaging technique that is increasingly used for detailed visualization of peripheral nerves not reliably achieved with conventional imaging modalities. Although MRN has been previously characterized in the literature, few studies have assessed its utility to neurosurgery, where there is potentially substantial impact particularly with preoperative assessment. In this article, we performed a retrospective review of cases in which MRN was used for clinical evaluation and surgical decision making.
   METHODS: MRN, clinical assessment, and operative decision making were retrospectively assessed in 206 consecutive patients at our institution between 2015 and 2018.
   RESULTS: MRN was determined to lead to a change in diagnosis or surgical decision making in 44 patients (21.4%: 27 female, 17 male). These were classified into 6 major diagnostic categories: trauma, postsurgical evaluation, compressive/degenerative conditions, tumors, neuritis/inflammation, and other neurogenic lesions. Nine representative cases were selected from these categories to highlight the range of neurosurgical pathologies in which MRN was useful in diagnostic assessment and surgical decision making.
   CONCLUSIONS: MRN is an underused resource with great potential value in the diagnoses, surgical planning, and postoperative assessment of various neurosurgical conditions. These present incremental utility to the neurosurgeon as well as socioeconomic benefit in the detection of potentially surgically treatable lesions.

AB BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to compare the incidence of cement leakage between unilateral and bilateral percutaneous vertebral augmentation (PVA) in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
   METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to retrieve the reported data from the establishment of the databases until August 1, 2018. The RCTs on unilateral and bilateral PVA for OVCFs were included. RevMan software, version 5.3, was used for the meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: Six RCTs were selected from the reported data. The studies included a total of 676 vertebras, 339 of which had received unilateral PVA and the rest, bilateral PVA. The incidence of cement leakage in the unilateral PVA group was less than that in the bilateral PVA group, and the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (risk ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.72; P = 0.0002). The cement dosage in the unilateral PVA group was less than that in the bilateral PVA group, and the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (weighted mean difference, -1.98; 95% confidence interval, -2.24 to -1.72; P < 0.00001). The cement dosage and the incidence of cement leakage in the unilateral PVA group were lower than those in the bilateral PVA group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of our meta-analysis have provided sufficient evidence to show that the unilateral approach can decrease the incidence of cement leakage in PVA. We believe the unilateral approach could reduce the risk of cement leakage owing to the lower cement dosage in the treated vertebra.

AB BACKGROUND: Sagittal imbalance in adult spinal deformity (ASD) likely influences balance and ambulatory capacity because of muscular demand, pain, and disability. Disability measures for ASD rely heavily on ambulatory function; however, current metrics may fail to fully capture its contribution. We sought 1) to determine the utility of continuous remote step count monitoring and activity tracking in ASD using a consumer-friendly accelerometer, and 2) to investigate trends and patterns both before and after surgical intervention.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: One patient with progressive ASD was enrolled. Daily step count (SC), distance traveled (DT), and levels of activity were measured using a wrist-mounted device for 17 months. Spinopelvic parameters were measured from standing radiographs. The patient underwent T4-ilium long-segment fusion for correction of progressive deformity (coronal cobb angle: 8 degrees; sagittal vertical axis: 4 cm; coronal vertical axis: 2 cm); recovery was uneventful. The device was worn for 216 of 520 (41%) recorded days during waking hours, with an average SC of 5254 +/- 2696 per day. SC (P < 0.001), DT (P < 0.001), and minutes of light activity (LA) (P < 0.001) declined over the 9-month preoperative course, whereas sedentary activity increased (P < 0.001). After surgery, SC, DT, and LA decreased in the early postoperative period, with a significant increase at 7-8 months compared with the preoperative period (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Wrist-mounted devices are a noninvasive and effective measure to track daily activity and ambulatory capacity of patients with spinal deformity. In a single case, progressive deformity correlated with worsening activity levels, whereas deformity correction improved SC and activity level. These results support remote activity monitoring as an exploratory outcome for future studies.

TI Distal Radial Artery Access in the Anatomical Snuffbox for
   Neurointerventions: Case Report
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Access; Distal radial; Endovascular; Neurointerventional; Stroke
ID TRANSRADIAL ACCESS; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: The distal transradial approach (dTRA) is being widely adopted by interventional cardiologists, primarily owing to reduced morbidity and mortality from access site complications. The distal radial artery has advantages over standard radial access in relation to procedural positioning and radial artery preservation, particularly in patients who may require multiple angiograms. One disadvantage is the smaller diameter of the artery with more challenging puncture of a smaller, weaker artery. We demonstrate the feasibility of dTRA in 2 patients who underwent successful diagnostic angiography and mechanical thrombectomy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients underwent dTRA for neurointerventions. In patient 1, a 5-F Glidesheath Slender and a Sim2 catheter were used for a 6-vessel cerebral angiogram. In patient 2, an 0.88-inch sheathless guide catheter was used to perform a mechanical thrombectomy. Successful hemostasis in both cases was achieved with a Safeguard Radial Compression Device; no complications were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurovascular access via dTRA is feasible, and further exploration is warranted.

DE Breakdown; Cervical artificial disc replacement; Cervicalgias;
   Granuloma; Nylon; Prosthesis; Total disc arthroplasty
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical total disc arthroplasty (TDA), or cervical artificial disc replacement, is an alternative technique to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for treatment of symptomatic degenerative cervical spine disease. The main goal of TDA is to maintain cervical motion and lower the risk of deterioration of adjacent levels. Granuloma formation on a cervical TDA is exceptional.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old woman with left cervicobrachialgia underwent a double-level TDA (M6-C Artificial Cervical Disc) on C5-C6 and C6-C7 at another hospital in 2010. Two years later, she reported a recurrence of cervicalgia, which was refractory to conservative treatment by rigid collar and analgesics. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging suggested a granulomatous formation on the C6-C7 prosthesis. She underwent removal of the C6-C7 prosthesis, which showed a rupture with nylon thread extrusion. An arthrodesis with plate was subsequently performed. Follow-up showed improvement of her clinical status. Histopathologic studies showed a giant cell granulomatous formation in contact with nylon threads described in hip, shoulder, and ankle arthroplasty. It has been described in 6 cases following lumbar TDA and 2 cases following cervical TDA.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report a third case of granulomatous reaction on nylon thread extrusion after partial breakdown of a prosthesis for cervical TDA.

AB BACKGROUND: Acoustic neuromas (ANs) are benign intracranial tumors that arise from myelin-forming Schwann cells surrounding the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). Treatment options for AN include observation, radiosurgery, and microsurgical resection. Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for AN has well-documented short-term safety and efficacy for carefully selected patients. Recent innovations in GKRS technology may improve long-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to report long-term tumor control and complication rates after GKRS for sporadic AN.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients with sporadic ANs at Keck Hospital of USC who underwent GKRS from 1995 to 2015 with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.
   RESULTS: Median age at treatment was 63.7 years (range, 19.4-84.2 years). Median follow-up time was 69 months. Median tumor diameter was 17.5 mm (range, 5.0-29.0 mm), and median treatment volume was 2.41 cm(3) (range, 0.09-12.8 cm(3)). Median prescribed dose was 12.50 Gy. Tumor control was achieved in 51 (98.1%) patients over the follow-up period (12-192 months). One patient experienced tumor progression at 22 months after GKRS, requiring surgical intervention, which ultimately resulted in remission. Complications included hearing loss (17.3%), worsened balance/ataxia (7.7%), and hydrocephalus (1.92%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing GKRS for sporadic ANs had high rates of tumor control over a median follow-up time of >5 years. Improvements in radiosurgery treatment planning were seen in the most recent cohort of patients. GKRS is a safe and effective modality for treating sporadic ANs in selected patients.

AB We describe the case of a 33-year-old woman with a history of over 15 years of a slow growing firm osseous-like right retroauricular mass. Surgical resection was easily performed using a sharp technique, because of a clear cleavage plane. The histologic diagnosis was a rare, unexpected, protuberant fibroosseous lesion named "Bullough lesion." Only few cases of this benign pathologic entity have been described in English literature. Clinical differential diagnosis must be done with osteoma, periosteal chondroma, and other fibroosseous lesions such as fibrodysplasia and ossifying fibroma. Because of the paucity of data, the natural history of this lesion is unknown and serial clinical and radiological follow-up is advised.

AB BACKGROUND: Internal carotid artery (ICA) injury is 1 of the most feared complications in endoscopic pituitary surgery. Different endovascular techniques are available for the management of early and delayed ICA injuries.
   CASE REPORT: We report a case of emergency endovascular treatment with a flow diverter stent for an ICA injury that occurred during endoscopic transphenoidal surgery for pituitary macroadenoma in a 66-year-old man. Effective intraoperative hemostasis was achieved by direct packing of the sphenoid sinus. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated extravasation of the contrast agent into the sphenoidal sinus from the anterior genu of the intracavernous portion of the right ICA. Balloon test occlusion resulted in a prominent delay in the venous phase in the right hemisphere during occlusion of the right ICA. Taking into account the hemodynamic stability and the absence of intracranial bleeding, we considered the ICA injury as if it were a pseudoaneurysm. Therefore, an emergency release of a flow diverter stent was performed, in association with antiplatelet therapy. No periprocedural complications occurred. The patient was discharged without neurologic deficits. The last follow-up studies at 6 months (digital subtraction angiography and magnetic resonance imaging) confirmed the regular placement of the stent and vessel reconstruction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the presence of acute hemorrhage and the need for antiplatelet therapy, a flow diverter stent can be used as emergency treatment of ICA injury in selected circumstances.

   laryngeal nerve palsy; RLNP
ID MICROVASCULAR DECOMPRESSION; SPINE SURGERY; FACIAL PALSY; PARALYSIS;
   RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Vocal cord dysfunction resulting from recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RLNP) is a known complication following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. RLNP occurs typically secondary to neurapraxia caused by intraoperative compression or traction on the nerve and less commonly from direct nerve injury intraoperatively in the setting of anterior cervical spine surgery. Patients with RLNP typically present with hoarseness immediately after surgery owing to unilateral vocal cord paralysis. In rare cases, there is late-onset, progressive development of RLNP that may potentially lead to permanent vocal cord paralysis or respiratory failure.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old woman presented with myeloradiculopathy and chronic urinary incontinence. Imaging showed severe foraminal and central stenosis with T2 cord signal change. A C4-7 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was successfully performed without immediate complications following surgery. The patient had a normal voice and was tolerating a regular diet well. On postoperative day 3, the patient developed new hoarseness and dysphagia. An otolaryngologist was consulted, and flexible nasolaryngoscopy showed left vocal cord paralysis consistent with left RLNP. The patient was treated with a course of steroids, and her hoarseness and dysphagia had resolved at the 6-month follow-up visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of delayed RLNP in patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. This rare complication should be discussed during preoperative patient counseling. Previous literature indicates the underlying pathophysiology for delayed onset of RLNP may be small vessel ischemia, vasospasm, or viral resurgence that leads to recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction.

TI Natural Cerebral Aneurysm and Spontaneous Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in
   Mammals Other Than Man: Is There a Scope for Comparative Medicine?

   aneurysm; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID PERFORATION MODEL; ANIMAL-MODELS; PATHOLOGY; ARTERIES; BRAIN; MOUSE
AB BACKGROUND: Concepts that showed substantial efficacy in animal models of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) often failed to improve outcome in humans with aneurysmal SAH. The concept of "comparative medicine," an open-minded comparison across species, might offer an alternative to the "constructed" animal models' approach. Naturally occurring diseases in animals might bear more similarity to human diseases than models. In this context, the question arises whether spontaneous intracranial aneurysms exist in animals or not, and whether they cause SAH or not.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed. Only articles dealing with natural aneurysms and/or SAH of mammals other than man were included. All articles dealing with induced aneurysms and/or SAH were removed.
   RESULTS: Of 2812 screened articles, 9 articles describing natural intracranial aneurysms and/or SAH were found. In total 1979 individual animals of 29 species were examined. Natural intracranial aneurysms were described in 7 individual animals of 6 species. Spontaneous SAH was described in 3 species. In 1 chimpanzee, a ruptured intracranial aneurysm caused an SAH. Histological descriptions of the aneurysms were strikingly similar to those of humans.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although interesting and innovative, the concept of "comparative medicine" seems to be impracticable due to the seemingly ultralow incidence of natural aneurysmal SAH in mammals other than man. The answer to the question "why intracranial aneurysms are less common in animals despite the strong histological similarity of cerebral arteries" might be a key issue. Last but not least, primates likely matter in SAH-related research, as aneurysmal SAH occurs in primates.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) treatment with continuous radiofrequency (CRF) to improve pain, functionality, and safety profile in patients with facet joint chronic low back pain.
   METHODS: A systematic, critical review of recent literature was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Clinical Trials, and LILACS databases were searched. Medical Subject Heading terms were "low back pain," "zygapophyseal joint," and "pulsed radiofrequency treatment." Original research articles in peer-reviewed journals were included in the review. The articles were thoroughly examined and compared on the basis of study design and outcomes. Only studies that met the eligibility criteria were included.
   RESULTS: Three randomized clinical trials comprising 103 patients (39 in PRF group, 44 in CRF group, and 20 in control group) were included in the final analysis. Two trials compared PRF with CRF, and 1 trial compared 3 groups: PRF, CRF, and control with intervention as conventional treatment. The studies reported greater pain control and better functionality with CRF compared with PRF. PRF showed a decrease in visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index in 2 studies, and 1 study reported increased pain and disability after the intervention. No side effects were reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: PRF treatment is less effective than CRF regarding pain control and return of functionality in patients with facet joint chronic low back pain. We recommend CRF with a large safety profile after conventional treatment.

ID SPHENOID SINUS; EMPTY SELLA; CUSHINGS-DISEASE; ADENOMA; PATIENT; ORIGIN;

AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary tumors are common, well-described skull base tumors of sellar origin. However, there are reports of rare ectopic pituitary tumors that are found exclusively outside of the sella turcica. Ectopic pituitary tumors have not been holistically analyzed. This study describes presentation and clinical patterns found among patients with ectopic pituitary tumors.
   METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed for clinical descriptions of ectopic pituitary tumors. Reports of 85 applicable cases were evaluated.
   RESULTS: The most common locations of ectopic pituitary tumors were the sphenoid sinus, clivus, suprasellar space, nasopharynx, and cavernous sinus. The majority of ectopic pituitary tumors were reported as being functional secretory tumors; they were statistically significantly more likely to be functional tumors than sellar pituitary tumors. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone, prolactin, growth hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormoneLsecreting tumors were most commonly found. Bone invasion was reported in more than one third of the cases, and malignant transformations were reported in 6 cases. A large majority of patients presented with hormonal, neurologic, or physiologic symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ectopic pituitary tumors are a rare entity of pituitary tumors with a presentation that can mimic those of other skull base tumors. Clinical presentation often correlates to location of the tumor. Ectopic pituitary tumors were significantly more likely to be functional secretory tumors. They may also exhibit more aggressive behavior than sellar-located tumors. Ectopic pituitary tumors may be part of a spectrum of presenting pathologies. Further genetic or genomic analysis is necessary to better understand their pathogenesis and clinical presentations.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of image guidance (IG) in neurosurgery is ubiquitous, even though evidence from patient outcome data has remained limited to smaller, mostly observational, studies. Ommaya reservoir insertion (ORI) has been available as a treatment option for targeted intraventricular pharmaco-therapy since the 1960s, far preceding the modern neuronavigation era. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the impact of IG on surgical outcome from ORI.
   METHODS: A systematic database search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify studies on operative outcomes from ORI. Only studies reporting patient demographics and perioperative outcomes (hemorrhage, infection, malposition, malfunction, and mortality) were included. Study quality was assessed via MINORS criteria.
   RESULTS: Of the 3560 records screened, 43 studies met study inclusion criteria, for a total of 1995 ORI procedures. Pooled rates of outcome for IG compared with non-IG were 6.4% versus 14.1% for overall complications; 2.0% compared with 2.8% for catheter malfunction; 2.3% compared with 3.3% for catheter malposition; 0.7% compared with 4.5% for early infection; and 0.6% compared with 1.4% for mortality. Postoperative hemorrhage was increased at 3.4% compared with 2.4%. Subgroup analysis revealed a difference in early infection rate between frameless and frame-based IG at 0.0% versus 1.9%. Metaregression revealed a relationship between publication date and all operative outcomes except for catheter malposition and hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a historical context on the evolution of the practice of ORI and comprises the largest observational analysis of operative outcomes providing objective support for the use of IG in neurosurgery.

AB BACKGROUND: The trigeminocardiac reflex is a sudden onset of bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, or gastric hypermotility in response to stimulation of the trigeminal nerve.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old female underwent a left orbitozygomatic craniotomy to debulk a large skull base epidermoid cyst compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves. Intraoperatively, retraction of the temporalis muscle consistently produced asystole. Cessation of retraction resulted in prompt return of sinus rhythm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our report describes an unusual and extreme example of the trigeminocardiac reflex and explores possible etiologies. This is the third reported surgical case in which manipulation of the temporalis muscle alone was sufficient to elicit bradycardia and asystole, and the first such case within the context of neurosurgery. We emphasize the importance of surgical teams to be cognizant of such extreme examples of this reflex.

ID DISSECTING ANEURYSM; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Distal middle cerebral artery aneurysm (DMCAAn) is rare, and the clinical features and the etiology are not well understood. Segmental artery mediolysis (SAM) is a pathologic entity that affects the media of the muscular artery and can cause arterial dissection and a hemorrhagic event. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to SAM in the vertebral artery has been documented. However, SAH from a ruptured DMCAAn due to SAM has not yet been described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old woman presented with a headache and vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) revealed SAH, and CT angiography showed a DMCAAn, which was treated by trapping and resection. Histopathologic studies showed loss of the media and reparative changes in the arterial wall including intimal hyperplasia and increased vasa vasorum in the adventitia. These findings were indicative of SAM in the reparative phase. She did not show any other possible etiologies of DMCAAn including infectious endocarditis and vasculitis, and CT angiography of the trunk did not show any other vascular lesions. She was discharged from the hospital approximately 3 weeks after the surgery without any apparent neurological deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our case suggests that SAM can also occur in the middle cerebral artery and result in DMCAAn.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to prevent early post-traumatic seizure (PTS) for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is currently recommended, although published studies present contradictory results concerning the protective effect of AEDs.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify the association between the use of prophylactic AEDs, particularly of the 4 main drugs of interest (phenytoin, levetiracetam, valproate, or carbamazepine) versus placebo or no treatment, and risk of early seizures after TBI.
   METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The selection criteria were English written randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, comparing AEDs with placebo or no treatment, for prevention of early PTS. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled relative risk (RR). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to assess heterogeneity sources.
   RESULTS: This research included 3 RCTs (750 patients) and 6 observational studies (3362 patients), analyzing the efficacy of phenytoin, levetiracetam, and valproate. The pooled RR estimate across RCTs trended toward a protective effect (RR, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-1.72; I-2 = 59.5%); a significant protective association was shown when pooling the results across all 6 observational studies (RR, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.62; I-2 = 0%). When stratifying the observational studies by drug, no significant difference was observed (P interaction = 0.73). Begg and Egger tests indicated no publication bias among observational studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Only modest evidence suggested effectiveness of AEDs as prophylaxis of early PTS. Phenytoin was the most studied drug; more prospective studies are needed to assess the efficacy of other AEDs.

AB Different tumors can be encountered in the paraventricular regions, and whereas their deep location often make them difficult to access surgically, they may be amenable to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Therefore, tumor biopsy and histologic diagnosis are mandatory to optimize treatment. Different technical procedures have been recommended; the neuroendoscopic approach is accepted and widely used, in particular with an enlarged ventricular system. However, specifically with paraventricular tumors, tissue sampling may be challenging. In such a scenario, the use of intraoperative ultrasonography technique can add some advantages regarding diagnostic accuracy and procedure safety. Accordingly, in this study we describe a novel technical procedure in 7 selected patients in whom tumor tissue biopsy was performed in a coupled neuroendoscopic and ultrasound-guided environment. We define a neuroendoscopic intraoperative ultrasound technique. The main advantages of this technique are the identification of the tumor that may not been clearly identified underneath the ventricular ependymal through the neuroendoscopic window alone, and furthermore, that this technique gives the possibility to detect the depth of the needle advance\ment in the selected tissue while labeling the lesion beneath the ventricular ependyma. Moreover, intraoperative ultrasonography can reveal in a real-time fashion intracranial hemorrhages that may occur after tissue biopsy, therefore providing a useful tool to achieve valid and directed hemostasis when needed.

AB A 24-year-old woman presented to neurosurgical consultation for chronic back pain. The patient was long term in wheelchair for vertebral deformity. She was the third child of first-degree consanguineous parents. The 2 older brothers had also vertebral malformations. The radiological images showed butterfly vertebra, vertebral fusion, hemivertebrae, scoliosis, and rib malformation. The patient was in follow-up for restrictive lung disease. Motor evoked potentials and lower limb electromyography were normal. We recommended conservative treatment for the back pain with antalgic and physical therapy. Diagnosis of spondylocostal dysostosis, or Jarcho-Levin syndrome, was made based on radiological features. Radiological mages are pathognomonic. Spondylocostal dysostosis is a rare hereditary disorder associated with multiple vertebral and rib anomalies. The entity is distinct from spondylothoracic dysostosis, which has a higher mortality due to respiratory complications. The patient was not compliant for genetic familiar counseling. At 12-year follow-up, the patient was in periodic respiratory and motor rehabilitation therapy.

ID INDEX
AB BACKGROUND: Central neurocytomas are benign tumors accounting for <0.5% of all intracranial tumors. They are usually intraventricular, the most common site being the lateral ventricles, and are associated with good prognosis if they are completely resected surgically.
   CASE REPORT: We report the case of a middle-aged woman who was evaluated for recent-onset headache and for whom magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was suggestive of a solid cystic intraventricular mass spanning all the ventricles. The patient underwent subtotal excision of the mass, with intraoperative neuromonitoring. The result of Histopathologic examination was suggestive of atypical neurocytoma. The patient had complete neurologic recovery in spite of immediate postoperative deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Gross total resection should be the goal in all patients with central neurocytoma, but it may be limited because of proximity of the tumor to eloquent areas, especially in large tumors. Intraoperative neuromonitoring plays a pivotal role in maximal safe resection of such large tumors. Tetraventricular atypical central neurocytoma is a very rare entity; and this case could be, to the best of our knowledge, only the second reported case.

DE Brain tumor; Extra-axial tumor; Hemangiopericytoma; Solitary fibrous
   tumor; Spinal metastasis
AB BACKGROUND: Hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are rare and aggressive vascular mesenchymal tumors. Unlike meningiomas, which have a similar radiologic appearance, these tumors have a higher risk of local recurrence after resection, and distant metastasis can reach up to 23%. Metastases to the vertebral bones from an intracranial HPC are very rare, with so far only 9 cases reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 46-year-old man who was surgically treated for a presumed left parieto-occipital falx meningioma in 2008. He presented 9 years later with a thoracic vertebral mass that was causing relentless pain. Reexamination of the cranial pathology allowed correction of the diagnosis performed in 2008 to a meningeal HPC, and the spinal lesion was confirmed after surgery to be a metastatic tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: The literature lacks randomized controlled trials and large studies defining the natural history of HPC to draw clear recommendations for a precise management of the disease. However, en bloc resection followed by radiation therapy seems to provide the optimal treatment for a long disease-free survival.

   BIOPSY; HYDROCEPHALUS; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men, with an incidence of approximately 233,000 cases per year. Intracranial metastases are rare and, specifically, metastasis to the pineal gland has only been reported in 2 postmortem cases in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the first documented case of confirmed prostate cancer metastasis to the pineal gland in a living patient. The patient underwent an endoscopic third ventriculostomy and pineal lesion biopsy with complete resolution of his hydrocephalus and presenting symptoms. His biopsy results confirmed the prostate origin of the metastasis, and he subsequently underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of this lesion.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the clinical management of metastatic prostate cancer to the pineal region and description of the clinical outcome. Although prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, metastasis to the pineal has only been reported twice from autopsy examinations. Overall, pineal tumors in the geriatric population are exceedingly rare and the age and comorbidities in this patient made management quite unique.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe a novel technique in managing a patient with adjacent segment disease at the L5/S1 level.
   METHODS: We performed an endoscope-assisted anterior lumbar interbody fusion with computed tomography-guided, image-navigated unilateral cortical bone trajectory screw fixation to treat L5/S1 intervertebral disk pathology.
   RESULTS: Patient was successfully treated by a direct endoscopic decompression through the anterior access, interbody fusion using an anterior lumbar interbody fusion cage, unilateral cortical bone trajectory instrumentation under computed tomography-guided image navigation.
   CONCLUSIONS: This minimally invasive technique is effective in terms of decompression and fixation. It could be used as an alternative method to treat patients with L5/S1 adjacent segment disease.

ID SYNOVIAL CYSTS; DECOMPRESSION; RESECTION; FUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Use of a contralateral sublaminar endoscopic approach may minimize facet violation and better visualize the dura and cystic lesions during operation. The aim of this study was to introduce a surgical technique for contralateral sublaminar endoscopic removal of lumbar juxtafacet cysts using a percutaneous biportal endoscopic approach.
   METHODS: Ten cases of lumbar juxtafacet cyst were consecutively treated via a contralateral sublaminar endoscopic approach using percutaneous biportal endoscopic surgery. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans were evaluated on postoperative day 1 for optimal removal of cysts and neural decompression status. Clinical findings were evaluated in preoperative and postoperative periods using a visual analog scale for leg pain and the Oswestry Disability Index.
   RESULTS: Ten lumbar juxtafacet cysts in 10 patients were treated using the contralateral sublaminar biportal endoscopic approach. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging depicted complete removal of juxtafacet cysts and optimal neural decompression of treated segments in all patients. Preoperative visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores improved significantly after surgery: visual analog scale scores changed from 7.64 +/- 0.71 preoperatively to 1.63 +/- 1.28 at last follow-up visit (P < 0.05), and Oswestry Disability Index scores changed from 45.35 +/- 16.15 to 15.82 +/- 10.21 (P < 0.05). Mean operative time was 60.1 +/- 23.4 minutes.
   CONCLUSIONS: A contralateral sublaminar approach using percutaneous biportal endoscopy may be an alternative treatment for symptomatic lumbar juxtafacet cysts. This approach may minimize iatrogenic facet violation and traumatization of posterior musculoligamentous structures.

TI Apoplectic Silent Crooke Cell Adenoma with Adjacent Pseudoaneurysms:
   Causation or Bystander?
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysms; Apoplexy; Crooke cell adenoma; Pituitary gland
ID PITUITARY-ADENOMA; ANEURYSM; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Crooke cell adenomas (CCAs) are rare and potentially aggressive pituitary tumors that often invade the cavernous sinuses. Although clinical presentations of pituitary tumors may include the development of accompanying intracranial aneurysms, there are no documented cases of coexistent intracranial aneurysms and CCAs to date. Herein we describe an apoplectic silent CCA that presented with adjacent cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year old male patient presented for evaluation of headaches and diplopia. Subsequent imaging series revealed a hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma that had invaded the left cavernous sinus and circumferentially involved the ICA. Two pseudoaneurysms were visualized along regions of the ICA directly attached to the tumor. A transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic approach was used for resection of the tumor, which was identified histologically as a CCA. Endocrine evaluations characterized the tumor as nonfunctional. The patient experienced an excellent recovery with resolution of related symptoms. A pseudoaneurysm was treated with a Pipeline embolization device; however, it persisted at last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: CCAs are a poorly characterized and rare pituitary tumor type. In this case, an apoplectic silent CCA invaded the left cavernous sinus and presented with pseudoaneurysms along its involvement of the ICA. Accordingly, the authors speculated that the invasive qualities of this silent corticotroph adenoma may have directly contributed to the development of these aneurysms.

DE Ambidexterity; Neurosurgery; Surgical skills
ID HANDEDNESS
AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is examine the issue of ambidexterity under the neurosurgical lens and demonstrate its need, its validity, and its advantages to neurosurgery as a whole.
   METHODS: Inspiration can be derived from extraordinary circumstances that shaped ordinary people into legends. There have been instances in history where highly skilled professionals relying on hand motor skills had the misfortune of having to relearn their skill set with the other, less dominant hand.
   RESULTS: We as neurosurgeons have always been ahead of the curve. It is only natural for us to understand the need and advantages of using both our hands with equal dexterity. Whether ambidexterity is an inherited trait or one that can be taught and, if practiced, mastered has been controversial.
   CONCLUSION: These remarkable individuals from history demonstrate that if one is willing to practice without ego and one has the right motivation, one can use both hands with equal dexterity.

ID GENICULATE NEURALGIA; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; COMPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: The course of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) in the cerebellopontine angle may affect the technical options in microvascular decompression surgery for hemifacial spasm. A complex relationship between the AICA and the nervus intermedius has rarely been discussed in patients with hemifacial spasms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old woman presented with left facial spasms for 8 years. Intraoperative endoscopic observation confirmed that the left nervus intermedius crossed over the left AICA and limited its mobilization from the root exit zone (REZ) of the left facial nerve. Nervus intermedius section enabled mobilization of the AICA to decompress the facial nerve REZ. Her hemifacial spasm was resolved completely after the surgery with no significant complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: The AICA may be found between the nervus intermedius and the facial nerve proper in patients with hemifacial spasm. Endoscope can visualize the relationship between the AICA and the nervus intermedius. Nervus intermedius section is a useful option in case that the nervus intermedius limits adequate mobilization of the AICA from the facial nerve REZ.

AB BACKGROUND: A small number of reports have described subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from a ruptured aneurysm embedded within a prolactinoma. To the best of our knowledge, no reports have described an embedded carotid cavernous fistula. We report a patient with carotid cavernous fistula secondary to a ruptured internal carotid artery aneurysm embedded within a prolactinoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 61-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with sudden headache, vomiting, and dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a small acute subdural hematoma, recurrent prolactinoma, and left cavernous carotid aneurysm. Conservative therapy was initiated. Her serum prolactin level at hospitalization was 11,300 mu g/L; therefore, we initiated cabergoline therapy. Twenty days after cabergoline administration, she suddenly presented with left conjunctival injection and pulsatile tinnitus. Angiography showed a left direct carotid cavernous fistula with a connection between the cavernous internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus via the aneurysm and venous congestion. To prevent hemorrhagic stroke, we scheduled staged surgery. First, we urgently performed embolization of the cavernous sinus and fistula. One month later, to prevent aneurysm rerupture, we performed a radical operation with superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery double anastomosis with proximal occlusion of the left internal carotid artery at the cervical portion. The patient was discharged 2 weeks after surgery without neurological deficits. Follow-up angiography revealed complete occlusion of the aneurysm 2 months postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: An aneurysm embedded within a prolactinoma should be closely observed when cabergoline administration is started.

   Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma; Sarcoma; Solid cystic
AB BACKGROUND: Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), an uncommon soft tissue tumor, generally occurs in extremities and is characterized by an aggressive clinical course with frequent recurrences. Primary intracranial occurrence of LGFMS is rare. The few existing descriptions present the clinicopathologic aspects of LGFMS and lack information from a radiologic perspective. In these reports, the lesions appeared solid on imaging.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In a 45-year-old woman, a falx-based lesion with solid-cystic radiologic appearance that turned out to be LGFMS on histopathology. The patient's clinical follow-up (2 years) is presented along with a literature review of other primary central nervous system cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report emphasizes the radiologic aspects of LGFMS and describes an atypical solid-cystic appearance of this uncommon central nervous system tumor. This adds another facet to the imaging of LGFMS. Although rare, LGFMS can form a differential diagnosis of dural-based lesions.

AB BACKGROUND: Double crush of a nerve at the root level is not common. We describe here a double crush of the right L4 nerve with foramina to far lateral disk (ventral) and extraforaminal (dorsal) compression. The double crush was managed by endoscopy with a contralateral uniportal approach from the left interlaminar space. Right lateral recess stenosis at the same level was subsequently managed with the same approach.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 79-year-old lady presented to our clinic with a low backache, right leg pain, and weakness. On her right side, the straight leg raise test was 70 degrees, great toe dorsiflexion was grade 3/5, and hypoesthesia was present in the L4 dermatome. Her preoperative visual analog scale score was 9. Magnetic resonance imaging showed right lateral recess stenosis and a double compression of L4 nerve root from the dorsal and ventral sides. A diagnosis of right lateral recess stenosis with double crush of the right L4 nerve root was made.
   The patient was managed with percutaneous endoscopic contralateral interlaminar foraminotomy from the left interlaminar approach. She got relief for the symptoms and her postoperative visual analog scale score was 2. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography showed nerve root decompression and well-preserved facet joints
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the management of double crush at the nerve root level with interlaminar contralateral approach endoscopy (percutaneous endoscopic contralateral interlaminar foraminotomy) can deal with the issue effectively with facet joint preservation and other benefits of the minimally invasive spine procedure.

TI Indocyanine Green Videoangiography in the Surgical Treatment of Spinal
   Dural Arterovenous Fistula: A Useful Application
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DE Indocyanine green videoangiography; Mini-invasive spine surgery; Spinal
   dural arterovenous fistulas; Vertebral level miscounting
ID ANGIOGRAPHY
AB BACKGROUND: Indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-V) is used with increasing frequency in neurovascular surgery. ICG-V use in spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) allows visualization of the hemodynamics of the fistula and to confirm its exclusion after ligation of the feeder. Here, we illustrate how ICG-V is useful for centering the surgical exposure during mini-invasive approaches to spinal DAVFs.
   METHODS: An overweight 66-year-old woman with progressive paraparesis and sphincter disturbances underwent treatment for a spinal DAVF fed by the left T6 radicular artery. After intraoperative fluoroscopy, T6 hemilaminectomy was performed. Because of slight misplacement of the bone opening, the feeder was not visible at the dural opening. We placed a temporary clip on a perimedullary arterialized vein and performed ICG-V while removing the clip.
   RESULTS: Reviewing the video clip and analyzing the direction of ICG flow inside the perimedullary venous plexus allowed us to locate the fistula with respect to the bone window and to extend the laminectomy in the correct direction.
   CONCLUSIONS: IGC-V can be helpful in mini-invasive approaches to spinal DAVFs to recalibrate the bone opening after misplacement of the initial hemilaminectomy.

ID HEROIN-ADDICTION; PATTERNS
AB BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA) addiction is one of the most prevalent socioeconomic and health problems worldwide. In recent years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has increasingly been used for the treatment of addiction.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This study reports on 2 MA-dependent patients who received DBS of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). During the approximately 2-year follow-up period, one patient (A) remained abstinent and presented with positive emotional experiences, whereas the other (B) had no significant psychobehavioral changes during stimulation at low-to-moderate voltages and subsequently relapsed. Through coregistration of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging with postoperative computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, the DBS electrode of patient A was confirmed to be accurately implanted in the NAc, whereas one side of the electrode of patient B deviated from the target.
   CONCLUSIONS: These case reports demonstrate that NAc-DBS maybe a possible treatment option for MA addiction.

TI Spontaneous Recovery of Complete Foot Drop in Case of Lumbar Disk
   Herniation: Catcher in the Rye?
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Ankle dorsiflexion; Foot drop; Prolapsed Lumbar disc; Spine
ID INFARCTION; DISEASES
AB BACKGROUND: Foot drop is defined as inability to dorsiflex the foot at the ankle joint. Although a well-documented entity with a myriad of causes along the neuraxis, starting from parasagittal intracranial pathologies to peripheral nerve lesions, treatment has always remained uniform (i.e., elimination of the causative pathology. A conservative approach with complete recovery has never been documented with video evidence).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old female presented with dorsiflexion weakness of the left ankle secondary to a prolapsed disk at the L4-5 level. The duration of the foot drop was short (3 days). She was planned for surgery but kept under close observation considering the consistent recovery of the symptoms. To our astonishment she had rapid pain relief in the next 5 days. Motor power improved over 3 weeks, and she had complete recovery in 4 weeks. Video recordings were made to document the improved power at both stages.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous recovery of complete foot drop is possible, and there is a role for the conservative management even with dense neurologic deficit in cases of lumbar disk herniation. Careful repeated examination is the key for conservative management before jumping to aggressive surgical intervention.

AB Today, stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective therapy for a variety of intracranial pathology that were treated solely with open neurosurgery in the past. The technique was developed from the combination of therapeutic radiation and stereotactic devices for the precise localization of intracranial targets. Although stereotactic radiosurgery was originally performed as a partnership between neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists, this partnership has weakened in recent years, with some procedures being performed without neurosurgeons. At the same time, neurosurgeons across the United States and Canada have found their stereotactic radiosurgery training during residency inadequate. Although neurosurgeons, residency directors, and department chairs agree that stereotactic radiosurgery education and exposure during neurosurgery training could be improved, a limited number of resources exist for this kind of education. This review describes the history of stereotactic radiosurgery, assesses the state of its use and education today, and provides recommendations for the improvement of neurosurgical education in stereotactic radiosurgery for the future.

AB OBJECTIVE: Craniocerebral disproportion (CCD) is a challenging disease, and several expansile procedures have been used for its treatment. This report describes the dynamic chess-table cranial expansion technique and reports on 9 patients with primary and secondary CCD treated with this procedure.
   METHODS: Nine patients affected by CCD were treated with chess-table cranial expansion and reviewed. Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and radio-logic findings were analyzed. ICP was monitored using epidural or telemetric sensors. Intracranial volume was measured using computed tomography image processing tools before the surgery, 24 hours after the surgery, and 1 month later. A mathematical model was developed to explain the clinical and surgical results.
   RESULTS: Five patients had secondary CCD and 4 had primary CCD. The mean age for cranial expansion was 16.78 years. The most frequent symptoms were headaches, nausea/vomiting, and decreased consciousness. Slit ventricles and sutural sclerosis were observed in 33.3% and 55.6% of patients. The mean ICP before the procedure was 48.67 mm Hg. Progressive cranial expansion was seen in all patients after surgery. The mean ICP decreased to 11 mm Hg and mean intracranial volume expansion was 85.8 cm(3) at 1 month after surgery. There were no serious complications after surgery. All patients improved their symptoms, and no patient needed additional cranial expansion procedures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Chess-table cranial expansion is a safe and effective procedure and may be used as an alternative treatment for CCD. Progressive expansion of the intracranial volume is related to a decrease in ICP recordings and an improvement of symptoms.

AB BACKGROUND: Giant pituitary adenomas are rare tumors that can have a devastating impact on a patient's life. They require a well-studied therapeutic approach that often combines different strategies.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with the largest GH-secreting pituitary adenoma reported in the literature, to the best of the author's knowledge. The tumor was removed with a combined approach: endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal and transcortical transventricular. All available acromegaly drugs were used.
   After 2 surgeries, a large part of the tumor was removed. Both postoperative courses were uneventful. Because the disease was still active, medical therapy was initiated. The combination of pasireotide, pegvisomant, and cabergoline permitted satisfactory control of hormonal levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: Giant adenomas, >4 cm, are rare pituitary tumors. Therefore in order to achieve the best clinical results, they require complex management that involves a multidisciplinary team of ear, nose, and throat surgeons; endocrinologists; radiation therapists; ophthalmologists; and neurosurgeons.

AB From the predominance of the pre-Columbian cultures to the present, an interest has existed in Mexico in brain structure and function, in both normal and pathological conditions. This interest has resulted in both medical and surgical attempts to treat some neurological conditions. Eighty years ago, with the influence of American and European neurosurgeons, modern Mexican neurosurgery emerged. Since then, it has progressively grown and diversified into several high specialties. At present, functional neurosurgery in Mexico constitutes, similar to that in other countries, a recognized surgical subspecialty that provides valuable information to treat brain dysfunctions such as movement disorders, pain, epilepsy, and other conditions. In the present report, we have briefly described the main historical aspects of the emergence and development of functional neurosurgery in Mexico.

The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed using the following parameters: heterogeneity, weighted mean difference (WMD), relative risk, 95% confidence interval (CI), and subgroup analysis.
   RESULTS: Seven studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 2 nonrandomized controlled trials) were included in which 529 patients were treated by PLIF. We found that intravenous TXA can reduce total blood loss (WMD = -172.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] -204.70 to -139.37), intraoperative blood loss (WMD = -83.10, 95% CI -117.61 to -48.60), and postoperative blood loss (WMD = -83.10, 95% CI -117.61 to -48.60) but cannot reduce the blood transfusion rates (relative risk = 0.39; 95% CI 0.21-0.72). High-dose TXA could more effectively reduce the blood loss than the low-dose TXA. The risk of thrombotic events was not observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that intravenous TXA can significantly reduce surgical blood loss and patients treated with TXA did not have a significant decrease in transfusion rates. Furthermore, it is safe and does not increase the risk of thrombotic events. We recommend intravenous TXA and the use of high-dose TXA during PLIF in adults. However, more high-quality and large-sample studies will be needed to confirm this result.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Dural-based lesions; Dural-based lymphoma; Lymphoma; Meningioma;
   Sarcoidosis
ID B-CELL LYMPHOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Primary dural-based lymphoma is a rare disease entity. It has been hypothesized that patients with sarcoidosis are at increased risk of developing lymphoma, an association known as "sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome," although dural disease has not yet been reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report the first case of dural-based lymphoma in a 60-year-old man with a history of sarcoidosis, in keeping with sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome. His dural-based tumor was surgically resected. Pathology examination revealed a marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Subsequent neural and systemic staging confirmed a localized lymphoma. The patient received local radiotherapy to control leptomeningeal disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given the association between sarcoidosis and lymphoma, we suggest lymphoma to be considered as one of the top differentials for a dural-based mass lesion in patients with sarcoidosis.

ID LYMPHOMA; LESIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Primary intramedullary spinal cord (IMSC) glioblastoma (GBM) is an extremely rare entity; we report the first case of primary IMSC GBM presenting with exophytic involvement. The prognosis of glioblastoma remains poor due to the aggressive nature of the disease and lack of effective treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old Asian female presented to our hospital with a 1-month history of dysuria, incomplete bladder emptying, progressive numbness, and weakness of both lower limbs, as well as a 1-year history of back pain. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intramedullary lesion and exophytic growth in the T4-T12 and T5-12 regions, respectively. The patient's MRI findings were atypical of spinal glioblastoma. The diagnosis was made on the basis of immunohistochemical and pathologic analyses of tissue samples obtained from an open biopsy. The patient received a standard course of glioblastoma radiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy, which improved her symptoms in the absence of an apparent reduction in tumor size.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although MRI is of indisputable importance in the diagnosis of spinal cord lesions, immunohistochemical and histopathologic studies are often required to establish a definitive diagnosis. It remains unclear how the unusual involvement of exophytic growth will affect the prognosis of primary IMSC GBM.

AB BACKGROUND: Craniovertebral junction arachnoid cysts are uncommon. Among those reported, ventrally located arachnoid cysts at the extremes of age have been even rarer. We report a successfully managed case of a ventrally placed arachnoid cyst in an 88-year-old man using an unconventional surgical approach.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 88-year-old man presented to us with complaints of tingling and numbness in both upper and lower limbs. He had a weak handgrip on both sides. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a none-contrast-enhancing cystic lesion over the anterior lip of the foreman magnum that had displaced the cervicomedullary junction posteriorly. The lesion was homogenously hypointense on T1-weighted MRI and hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI. The lesion was excised using a posterior approach. The cyst contents were drained, followed by complete wall excision. Complete improvement in clinical symptoms and an absence of neurological deficits were noted in the patient.
   CONCLUSION: Arachnoid cysts are congenital lesions and can present at the extremes of age. Ventrally placed small symptomatic arachnoid cysts can be managed successfully through the posterior approach, especially in the elderly population.

ID VERTEBRAL EROSIONS; FOLLOW-UP; PREVALENCE; JOINTS; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Atlantoaxial instability owing to bone erosions in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is rare. We describe the radiographic characteristics, pathology, and treatment of a patient with this rare clinical manifestation and review the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old man with an 8-year history of AS presented with progressive neck pain, low back pain, hand numbness, and limited mobility of the neck. Cervical radiography showed anterior atlantoaxial sub-luxation with bone erosions at the odontoid process and a mass lateral to the atlas and edge of vertebrae. AS was diagnosed according to the modified New York criteria, and the patient underwent a posterior C0-C6 occipitocervical arthrodesis surgery and C3-C6 laminectomy to reconstruct atlantoaxial stability and relieve cervical compression. The symptoms of neck pain and hand numbness improved at the 1-year follow-up, and the patient completely resumed normal activities. Imaging showed realignment of C1-2 with complete decompression of the spinal cord and fusion of the atlantooccipital joint. The internal fixation has remained stable, and progressive bone erosion changes were not found after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Extensive cervical erosions with spontaneous atlantoaxial subluxation in AS is extremely rare. The erosive change of atlantoaxial bone may be an early feature of AS. Cervical spine radiographs are essential for patients with AS who present with neck pain. Complete decompression and internal fixation are necessary to prevent serious neurologic morbidity from spinal cord injury in such patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Rapid progression of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors has been described and is associated with a poor prognosis. We describe the first reported case of accelerated NSCLC tumor extension throughout the entire spinal epidural space.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68-year-old woman with stage IV ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC presented with acute neck pain, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness 15 days post discontinuation of alectinib. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast was significant for a new compressive lesion spanning the entire cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, which was new compared with MRI obtained 20 days before and was suspicious for infection. Cervical (C3-C7), thoracic (T9-T12), and lumbar (L3-L5) decompression were performed with collection of culture and pathology specimens. Repeat MRI obtained for acute neurologic deterioration on postoperative day 2 noted further progression of disease and continued thoracic cord compression. After urgent T1-9 laminectomy, specimens were again sent for pathology, cultures, and cytology. No evidence of infection was noted, and all pathologic specimens evaluated were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. Despite operative intervention, the patient continued to decline, suffering from recurrent pleural effusions, and eventual cardiopulmonary arrest 11 days after admission.
   CONCLUSIONS: The differential diagnosis when evaluating presumed spine epidural abscess should include tumor and metastatic disease, even in cases of rapid development. Recent termination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or ALK inhibitors may result in severe disease flares, and a history of such should raise clinical suspicion for metastatic progression. In addition to cultures, biopsy for pathologic diagnosis should be collected during decompressive surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Extracranial metastasis, mainly a feature of World Health Organization (WHO) grade III meningiomas, is only rarely reported in grade II meningiomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 48-year-old man who was initially diagnosed in 2010 with an occipital convexity meningioma based on computed tomography scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and treated with surgical therapy and gamma knife. The first operation achieved a macroscopically complete resection. The tumor was histologically classified as an atypical meningioma. The patient had a recurrence in 2014 on the left tentorial leaflet as noted on postcontrast MRI. The patient was asymptomatic, without focal neurologic deficits. In 2016, the patient reported new-onset pain in the neck and left upper extremity. MRI indicated complete replacement of the C7 vertebral marrow, with a soft tissue component extending posteriorly into the epidural space that appeared to be flattening the thecal sac but without evidence of abnormal cord signal. Histopathology of resection confirmed atypical meningioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case represents a rare instance of intraosseous spine as the first site of metastasis of WHO grade II atypical meningioma and is the first reported case of extracranial metastasis of a meningioma to the C7 vertebral body.

AB OBJECTIVE: The evidence regarding the consequences of subsidence with lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) has been sparse. The objective of this study is to calculate the incidence of subsidence and reoperation for subsidence after LLIF. A secondary outcome examined the quantitative degree of subsidence by calculating the percent change in the height of the intervertebral space secondary to interbody subsidence at various postoperative follow-up times.
   METHODS: Following the MOOSE (Meta-analysis [and Systematic Review] Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines, a systematic review searched for all cohort studies that focused on subsidence rates after LLIF, including extreme lateral interbody fusions (XLIFs) and direct lateral interbody fusion. Neoplastic, infectious, and/or metabolic indications for LLIF were similarly excluded because these diseases may compromise bone quality and, thus, confound the rate of cage subsidence. Corpectomies were removed from the systematic review because 1) indications for removal of vertebral body typically reflect those excluded diseases and 2) subsidence refers to a different biomechanical process.
   RESULTS: This systematic review identified a subsidence incidence with LLIF of 10.3% (N = 141/1362 patients in 14 articles) and reoperation rate for subsidence of 2.7% (N = 41/1470 patients in 16 articles). In the secondary outcome measure, the disc height decreased from 5.6% after 3 months, 6.0% after 6 months, and 10.2% after 12 months, to 8.9% after 24 months (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Subsidence after LLIF carries a nonnegligible risk that may be incorporated in surgical consent discussions in selected patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Classic trigeminal neuralgia is an often debilitating condition that frequently results from vascular compression at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve. We report a case of dural arteriovenous fistula surrounding the trigeminal nerve from near the root entry zone extending as far ventral as the Meckel cave treated solely with Gamma Knife radiosurgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 71-year-old woman presented with a history of persistent attacks of right facial pain after failed conservative management. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated dilated vasculature in the right cerebellopontine angle, and diagnostic cerebral angiography revealed a dural arteriovenous fistula surrounding the right trigeminal nerve. Stereotactic radiosurgery using Gamma Knife was performed. At 6-month follow-up, she was symptom-free with decreased caliber of abnormal vascularity surrounding the trigeminal nerve on magnetic resonance imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that trigeminal neuralgia associated with dural arteriovenous fistula can potentially be treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery; however, more extensive studies and long-term follow-up to evaluate vessel patency will be necessary to elucidate further the role of stereotactic radiosurgery alone in treating this entity.

AB BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma is a very common neurosurgical condition. Although conventional surgical methods, such as burr hole irrigation, have been the mainstay of treatment, middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization has emerged as a promising adjunctive or alternative treatment. The aim of this article was to present a meta-analysis and systematic review of this topic.
   METHODS: A literature search using keywords "chronic subdural hematoma," "chronic subdural hemorrhage," "refractory subdural hematoma," "refractory subdural hemorrhage," and "middle meningeal artery embolization" was conducted through October 2018. Outcome variables of hematoma recurrence, surgical complications, and modified Rankin Scale score were analyzed and compared between MMA embolization and conventional surgery cohorts.
   RESULTS: Three double-arm studies comparing embolization and conventional surgery groups and 6 single-arm case series were identified and analyzed. Hematoma recurrence rate was significantly lower in the embolization group compared with conventional treatment group (2.1% vs. 27.7%; odds ratio = 0.087; 95% confidence interval, 0.026-0.292; P < 0.001; I-2 = 0%); surgical complication rates were similar between groups (2.1% vs. 4.4%; odds ratio = 0.563; 95% confidence interval, 0.107-2.96; P = 0.497; I-2 = 27.5%). Number of patients with modified Rankin Scale score >2 in the embolization (12.5%) versus conventional treatment (9.1%) group showed no statistical difference (P = 0.689). A composite hematoma recurrence rate of 3.6% was found after summing the 6 case series. Composite recurrence and complication rates in the embolization cohorts of the double-arm studies and the case series were lower than literature values for conventional surgical treatments.
   CONCLUSIONS: MMA embolization is a promising treatment for chronic subdural hematoma. Future randomized clinical trials are needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: The repositioning of a dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) for arterial decompression has been extensively used in the clinical setting. We aimed to describe and summarize the technical characteristics and clinical results of the sling technique.
   METHODS: The terms "dolichoectatic aneurysm," "dolichoectasia," "ectasia," and "megadolichoectasia" were used to search for pertinent reports related to the VBA territory. Studies related to the "decompression," "repositioning," "transposition," "anchoring," "pexy," and "sling" techniques were screened, collected, and summarized by 1 of us (L.W.).
   RESULTS: We identified 20 pertinent reports involving 59 cases. The sling repositioning techniques were divided into the following 4 subtypes: suture-lasso, vasculopexy, clip-lasso, and wrap-sling. Overall, 35 of the 59 patients (59.3%) were treated using the wrap-sling technique. Among these cases, Gore-Tex grafts were the most common sling material used. Of the cases with reported postoperative characteristics, all the patients except for 1 had experienced complete or significant remission of symptoms. Although 11 of the 59 patients (18.6%) had developed complications, the rate of adverse effects had decreased to 3.6% (2 of 55) during the long-term follow-up period (mean, 40.4 months; range, 2.1-168), and the outcomes were unremarkable in 54 of the 55 patients (98.2%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The excellent surgical outcomes and durable long-term results suggest that the repositioning technique is highly effective in resolving symptoms related to the compression of DVB pathology. The wrap-sling technique might be the preferred option owing to the simultaneous symptom relief and lower rate of temporary complications. However, cranial nerve manipulation should be meticulously implemented to avoid permanent negative effects.

AB BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare dendritic histiocytic disorder that affects the bones, especially the skull. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) developing in a burr hole site for chronic subdural hematoma is extremely rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old man underwent a burr hole irrigation for chronic subdural hematoma, and the burr hole was covered with a burr hole button made of hydroxyapatite. Seven months after the first surgery, the connective tissue rapidly proliferated around the burr hole button, and the pathologic diagnosis was LCH. LCH recurred at 13 and 19 months after the first operation, with curettage performed each time. At 3 months after the final operation, no recurrence was identified on magnetic resonance imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: If there is rapid proliferation of connective tissue at an operative site where artificial material has been used, LCH should be considered.

AB BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has appeared to be increasing over the years, its prognosis remains dismal. No consensus has yet been reached regarding the management of ICH; however, minimally invasive surgery should limit, if not avoid, intraoperative parenchymal damage. Therefore, we have presented a novel, modified "homemade" approach aimed to shorten the operative time and minimize the corticectomy and brain manipulation.
   METHODS: From 2008 to 2017, 53 patients (32 men and 21 women; mean age, 63.8 years) were admitted to our neurosurgery department and surgically treated for a lobar ICH. A modified suction tube, coupled with the endoscope light source, was used. Clot evacuation was performed under loupe magnification without the use of the microscope or endoscope. The light source of the latter was only used to provide light in the working cavity.
   RESULTS: The mean hematoma volume was 69.2 mL (range, 40-100) preoperatively and 12.1 mL (range, 0-20) postoperatively, with a mean clot evacuation of 84.3% (range, 60%-100%). The mean postoperative Glasgow coma scale score was 11.6, with an improvement of 14% from the admission score (mean, 9.2).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results from our clinical series have shown the effectiveness of endoscopic clot evacuation in surgical ICH. In addition, we have demonstrated an efficient technique that can be used in urgent cases and in less-developed areas owing to its reduced demand on resources and its shorter learning curve. The outcomes were good and comparable to those with the classical endoscopic approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary diffuse leptomeningeal melanomatosis (PDLM) is an extremely rare pathologic condition that can mimic several other neurologic disease states.
   METHODS: We report a rare case of PDLM without evidence of a primary focus. In addition, we performed a comprehensive review of the literature to describe all previously reported cases of PDLM.
   RESULTS: In the reported case, making the diagnosis of PDLM was difficult. A brain and frontal dural biopsy was nondiagnostic. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any distinct solitary mass. After a positron emission tomography scan was performed that showed lumbar sacral enhancement, lumbar dorsal rootlet biopsy was initiated, which was diagnostic of PDLM. Our literature review found 32 previously reported cases of PDLM. Sixteen cases (48.5%) had a distinct focus or mass discovered on imaging workup. The reported case was the seventeenth reported case of PDLM without a distinct focus or mass found on imaging workup.
   CONCLUSIONS: PDLM is an extremely rare disease, and diagnosis is difficult because of nonspecific clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings. In approximately half of cases, no distinct mass is shown on imaging workup, which may further complicate diagnosis. PDLM should be on the differential diagnosis for cases of diffuse dural enhancement. Neurosurgical intervention is often limited to ventriculoperitoneal shunting for increased intracranial pressure and dural and cranial biopsy to obtain diagnosis. If the initial biopsy is nondiagnostic, hypermetabolic activity as seen on positron emission tomography may be helpful to find an alternative biopsy site.

   LOBECTOMY; FOCI
AB BACKGROUND: Bitemporal epilepsy (BTLE) is a specific anatomoelectroclinical phenotype in the spectrum of temporal lobe epilepsy. The diagnosis of BTLE and the evaluation of the degree of seizure lateralization in BTLE patients are greatly influenced by the duration of EEG recording and the number of recorded habitual seizures.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 25-year-old woman had a 5-year history of seizures. Her habitual seizures were described as sudden behavioral arrest, staring, unresponsiveness, and oral automatisms, with auras of fear and palpitation. Intermittent scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG monitoring over 3 years showed multiphasic side-switching seizures. The seizures were limited to 1 temporal lobe within 1 phase and switched sides between phases. Despite antiepileptic drugs and vagus nerve stimulation, her seizures remained uncontrolled. The patient finally underwent unilateral anteromedial temporal lobectomy, mainly based on >60% of seizures recorded originating from the left side. The patient has been seizure free for more than 1 year at last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This patient presented 1 specific subtype of BTLE that is prone to be misdiagnosed as unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy if the patient is recorded for a relatively short term, e.g., over a common EEG monitoring duration of 1 to 2 weeks.

ID TENSION PNEUMOCEPHALUS
AB BACKGROUND: Pneumocephalus is an uncommon and life-threatening neurologic condition. Air within the ventricular system of the brain is also known as pneumoventricle (PV). It requires emergency treatments to prevent catastrophic neurologic outcomes. Head injury is the most common cause of PV, but there are other well-recognized etiologies in case there is no clear radiological evidence of skull discontinuity.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Although this clinical entity has been well described in the literature, our report presents the unique feature of describing a purely ventricular pneumocephalus without evidence of skull base or cranial vault fracture. Therefore, this case presentation explores mysterious causes of fistulous connections with the atmosphere that may lead to air trapped in and around the cranial vault.
   CONCLUSIONS: The aim of the present paper is to report a case of post-traumatic PV without radiological signs of skull base or convexity fracture in a 72-year-old man, underlining the diagnostic and clinical features, and review the relevant literature.

AB BACKGROUND: Stenosis of the target intracranial vertebral artery is one of the major causes of posterior circulation ischemic stroke. The objective of this paper is to explore methods for reducing the occurrence of medullary artery occlusion after intracranial vertebral artery stenting.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The current research presents a retrospective analysis of 48 patients who received Gateway-Wingspan stent angioplasty to treat severe stenosis of the intracranial vertebral artery, evaluates the results of stenosis remission and perfusion improvement after stent angioplasty, and explores the causes of postoperative medullary artery occlusion. A total of 49 Wingspan stents were implanted in the 48 patients, with a surgical success rate of 100%. After stent implantation, the patients' rates of intracranial vertebral artery stenosis dropped from 75.9% +/- 6.3% to 28.4% +/- 5.1%. Transcranial Doppler or cranial computed tomography angiography 3 months after surgery showed that none of the patients suffered from in-stent restenosis. Within 24 hours after surgery, medullary perforating artery occlusion occurred in 2 patients, probably because atherosclerotic plaque in the stenotic area became less stable and displaced under the mechanical action of postoperative saccule and stent. As a result, the medullary artery was blocked. After drug and rehabilitation therapies, the patients' symptoms were alleviated.
   CONCLUSIONS: Perforating artery occlusion after intracranial vertebral artery stenting can be prevented by strict assessment and preparation before surgery, correct choices of saccule and stent during operation, and other measures. However, large sample data are needed for verification.

AB BACKGROUND: Extracerebral neuroglial heterotopias are rare manifestations of cerebral tissue outside the brain whose most common form is the so-called nasal glioma. In this case report we illustrate the first case of heterotopic neuroglial tissue within the bone of the skull.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient underwent surgery for a sphenoid ridge meningioma. Aside from the expected meningioma, histopathologic examination showed a small amount of intraosseous heterotopic neuroglial tissue.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of cerebral heterotopias is diverse. Most of the midline lesions are probably residuals of former meningoencephaloceles. The pathogenesis of extracranial nonmidline lesions is more questionable. Their cause might be a former trauma, inflammatory disease, or surgery. Another option is that they represent primary neuroglial heterotopias, as it is supposed for manifestations of the lung.
   The coexistence of a heterotopia and a meningioma in this case is probably a coincidence. It is also debatable whether the broad tumor extension within the bone and/or the heterotopia might go back to alterations of the bone structure.

AB BACKGROUND: Cortical bone trajectory (CBT) technique for pedicle fixation has been proposed and adopted in recent years. This technique involves a mediolateral direction and a caudocephalad path to maximize screw purchase in cortical bone. Various techniques have been proposed to increase the accuracy of screw placement. A novel technique for CBT screw placement using a three-dimensional printed patient-specific drill guide (PSDG) is presented.
   METHODS: CBT screw fixation combined with posterior lumbar interbody fusion was performed for reduction of an L4-5 spondylolisthesis in a 71-year-old woman. PSDGs (MySpine MC Guides) were designed and printed based on the patient's preoperative computed tomography scan. PSDGs were used intraoperatively to facilitate screw trajectory and placement.
   RESULTS: Postoperative imaging performed at 6 weeks and 3 months revealed accurate screw trajectory with excellent reduction of spondylolisthesis. The patient improved clinically with minimal mechanical pain and claudication at 3-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: PSDG for CBT screw fixation offers significant benefits, including preoperative planning; improved screw placement accuracy while minimizing cortical breach; reduction of operative time; and lower cost compared with intraoperative computed tomography-based neuronavigation, thus expanding the availability of this technique. Drawbacks include time required for PSDG planning and learning curve for surgeons.

TI Improvement of Hypothalamic Hamartoma-Related Psychiatric Disorder After
   Stereotactic Laser Ablation: Case Report and Review of Literature

ID REFRACTORY EPILEPSY; CHILDREN; AGGRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic hamartomas (HHs) are nonneoplastic congenital malformations associated with refractory epilepsy and behavioral disorders. Improvement in behavioral functioning following resection of HHs has been reported. Stereotactic laser ablation (SLA), a minimally invasive technique, has been used for the treatment of HH-related epilepsy. We report the case of child with an HH, gelastic seizures, and severe psychiatric dysfunction who was successfully treated via SLA therapy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was an 11-year-old female with a history of central hypothyroidism, precocious puberty, and localization-related epilepsy thought to be secondary to an HH. She had a significant psychiatric history including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depressed mood, impulsivity, threatening behavior, and suicidal ideation requiring management with dexmethylphenidate, bupropion, and aripiprazole. Seizure onset occurred at age 7, and her semiology included nighttime hypermotor seizures and uncontrollable laughing spells thought to be gelastic seizures. Her hypermotor seizures were successfully managed with oxcabazepine monotherapy, but she continued to have several weekly laughing spells and self-harming behavior. Her HH was successfully treated via SLA. Postoperatively, she remained neurologically intact and was discharged the next day. At her 6-month follow-up, she had a markedly improved affect and general mood. At 3 years post-procedure, she remains seizure free and has been weaned off her antiepileptic and antipsychotic medications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Severe behavioral dysfunction in the setting of an HH may constitute an indication for surgical intervention. The outcome of this case suggests there may be a role for SLA in the management of HH-related psychiatric dysfunction, even in patients with good seizure control.

   PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a potential risk factor for stroke in women with Moyamoya disease. However, the rarity of the disease has limited clinical expertise to ensure a healthy pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to explore the possible risk factors for hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke in pregnant women with Moyamoya disease.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of cases in our hospital during a 20-year period and a review of the reported data were conducted to investigate pregnancy-related cerebrovascular events in women with Moyamoya disease.
   RESULTS: Thirty pregnancies in 20 women with Moyamoya disease were identified in the case review of our hospital. All were previously diagnosed cases, and no stroke had occurred during the study period. In the reported data review, pregnancy-related stroke in women with Moyamoya disease was identified in 54 (44 intracranial hemorrhage and 10 cerebral infarction). Intracranial hemorrhage occurred most commonly during the antepartum period (n = 39; 88.6%), with most events occurring at >= 24 weeks. Of the intracranial hemorrhage cases, 7 (15.9%) were complicated by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and 8 patients (18.2%) died of stroke. The onset of cerebral infarction was either in the antepartum (n = 4; 40.0%) or postpartum (n = 6; 60.0%) period. All postpartum cases occurred within 3-7 days after delivery.
   CONCLUSION: Pregnancy-related stroke in patients with Moyamoya disease might be susceptible to gestational age. Intracranial hemorrhage is prone to occur during the antepartum period, especially at >= 24 weeks, and cerebral infarction tends to occur postpartum.

AB BACKGROUND: Acellular nerve allografts (ANAs) have been established as promising alternatives to autologous nerve grafts, which represent the reference standard. Our research group recently performed a systematic review of reported cell-based-enriching methods for recellularization of ANAs. Recellularization results in consistent improvement of peripheral neuroregeneration compared with plain ANAs. We systematically reviewed the effects on nerve regeneration when ANA enrichment was obtained through biological, chemical, and physical modification instead of cells.
   METHODS: The PubMed, ScienceDirect, Medline, and Scopus databases were searched for reports of noncellular modification of ANAs, reported from January 2007 to December 2017. The inclusion criteria were English language, noncellular enrichment of ANAs in peripheral nerve regeneration, an in vivo study design, and postgrafting neuroregenerative outcomes assessment. The exclusion criteria were the central nervous system as the site of ANA application, nerve conduits, xenografts, case series, case reports, and reviews.
   RESULTS: Only animal studies were found to be eligible. We included 16 studies, which were analyzed regarding the animal model, decellularization method, graft-enriching mode, and neuroregenerative tests performed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Noncellular-based stimulation of ANAs demonstrated positive effects on recovery of nerve function compared with nerve grafting compared with plain ANAs. The neuroregenerative effect of autografting still appeared superior to ANAs, even with noncellular enrichment of ANAs. However, we found that in a few studies, modified ANAs closely approached or even outperformed autografts. Future research should include more preclinical investigations of this promising tool and clinical translation to increase the level of evidence available in the challenging field of peripheral nerve reconstruction.

AB OBJECTIVE:The mechanical alteration in the adolescent/pediatric cervical spine after spinal fusion remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate morphologic changes in the cervical spine in adolescent/pediatric patients who underwent spinal fusion.
   METHODS:Ten adolescent/pediatric patients (9-18 years) who underwent cervical spinal fusion were included. The anteroposterior diameter (AP-D) of the vertebral body was evaluated using lateral radiographs. The AP-D ratio was defined as the ratio of the AP-D at final follow-up to the postoperative value. The kyphosis angles at the fused level and cervical spine (C2-C7) also were measured.
   RESULTS:The mean follow-up period was 20.0 years (range, 12-40 years). The AP-D was reduced in 4 patients and increased or remained unchanged in 6 patients. The AP-D reduction was usually seen at the middle of the fused levels and was remarkable in patients who underwent kyphosis correction using posterior instrumentation combined with anterior fusion. The AP-D ratio was significantly correlated to segments of anterior fusion (P = 0.029) and the kyphosis angle of the fused levels (P = 0.016).
   CONCLUSIONS:Cervical kyphosis correction using posterior instrumentation combined with endplate destruction by anterior bone grafting is a risk factor for atrophic morphologic changes in the vertebral body in adolescent/pediatric patients. Endplate destruction and instrumentation-induced stress shielding could alter bone remodeling.

   CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; SINGLE-INSTITUTION; COILING; TRIAL; MORTALITY
AB BACKGROUND: We performed a rigorous statistical analysis of the complications and outcomes of patients with ruptured or unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Our emphasis was on the potential predictive factors when both surgical and endovascular management are offered by a team with balanced microsurgical and endovascular expertise.
   METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2011, 1297 consecutive patients presenting with ruptured (n = 829) or unruptured (n = 468) aneurysms were prospectively enrolled in our vascular database. The treatment modality was determined by consensus of the endovascular and microsurgical teams. The patients' medical and neurological conditions and aneurysm characteristics were compared against the postintervention complication rates and outcomes using multivariate analyses.
   RESULTS: The patients mostly underwent clipping for ruptured (63.7%) or unruptured (56.6%) aneurysms. For ruptured aneurysms, higher Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades on admission were key predictors of increased neurological (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) and medical (P < 0.001 and P = 0.041, respectively) complication rates. No significant differences in the outcomes were observed between the coiling or clipping groups during the follow-up period. For the unruptured group, a family history of intracranial aneurysms was the most relevant predictor for reducing neurological complication rates and increasing survival at 6 months. Hypertension was, however, the strongest factor associated with complications
   CONCLUSIONS: For the ruptured and unruptured groups both, the outcomes were generally good, although neurological and medical complications were reasonably more frequent for the ruptured aneurysms. Coiling provided a sustained benefit in lowering the complication rates only in the short term for the unruptured aneurysms. Smoking was associated, paradoxically, with improved outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Protecting the venous drainage route during surgery in cases of petroclival meningioma (PCM) is important. Identifying venous congestion preoperatively can be valuable in reducing the risks associated with venous congestion during surgery. In this study, we examined the utility of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in identifying the presence of venous congestion in PCM cases preoperatively and identified the factors associated with it.
   METHODS: We retrospectively examined 24 patients who had undergone surgery for primary PCM. The areas of the basal and internal cerebral veins on the affected and unaffected sides, obtained using SWI, were compared to identify venous congestion. We further examined the association between multiple candidate factors that are thought to be related to venous congestion and venous congestion using statistical analyses.
   RESULTS: SWI could successfully identify venous congestion in 11 of 24 PCM cases. Among the 12 factors examined, those associated with venous congestion were an extension of the tumor, over the midline or upward, which is known to disturb the venous flow at the brainstem surface; anastomosis of the superficial cerebral vein (i.e., bypass route for venous congestion); and a high ABC Surgical Risk Scale score, an indicator of postoperative neurologic deterioration.
   CONCLUSIONS: We showed that SWI is useful for evaluating venous congestion in PCM cases preoperatively and for identifying factors reflecting the risk of venous congestion. Taken together, our findings provide a multi-modal strategy for the preoperative prediction of venous congestion, which could facilitate the treatment of PCM.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with hydrocephalus experience symptoms related to hydrocephalus in an age-dependent manner. However, prevalence estimates of hydrocephalus symptoms in young and middle-aged (YMA) adult patients are rare and variable. Highlighting the importance of hydrocephalus symptom management, the persistence and intensity of headache or gait disturbance have been associated with signs of brain white matter integrity loss, including in treated YMA adult patients. Thus, it is important to ascertain which symptoms adult patients with hydrocephalus report most to confirm their relative importance.
   METHODS: Observations of symptom complaints were made from publicly viewable online responses to an inquiry posted by the Hydrocephalus Association to 2 Facebook webpages.
   RESULTS: Within 7 days of inquiry posting, 381 complaints of signs and symptoms were identified in 82 online responses. Headache, cognitive deficits (cognition and memory), and mobility issues (dizziness, balance, or gait problems) were most commonly reported by 63%, 45%, and 40% of respondents, respectively. Results were highly similar for the subgroup of 53 patients reported as treated. For self-identified YMA patients (<60 years old), results were similar, but with fewer mobility complaints. Not previously reported, hypersensitivity to external stimuli was reported by one-half of the patients that reported headache.
   CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide further quantitative support for the prioritization of study of headache, cognitive deficits, and mobility issues in YMA adult patients with hydrocephalus. Warranting further study, cranial hypersensitivity to external stimuli may represent a novel outcome measure, and treated YMA adult hydrocephalus patients continue to report symptoms associated with signs of brain damage.

ID PROLIFERATION INDEX; IDH1; CRANIOTOMY; KI-67
AB OBJECTIVE: Several parameters like extent of resection and MGMT promotor methylation in glioblastoma (GBM) are known to influence survival. Other elements like multifocality and proliferation indices are not commonly used. The aim of the present study was to analyze routinely and not routinely assessed prognostic markers for survival of patients suffering from GBM in a single center.
   METHODS: Adult cases with GBM operated at our institution were included in this survey. The association of age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), MGMT promotor methylation, Ki67 proliferation index, IDH1/2 mutational status, and multifocality on overall survival (OS) was analyzed in univariate and multivariate cox regression models.
   RESULTS: We analyzed 565 patients with a mean age of 62.2 (18-84) years. Median OS was 12.5 months. MGMT promoter methylation and IDH 1/2 mutation were associated with significant better OS (P < 0.01). In 48 cases (8.5%), the tumor was localized in both hemispheres, which was associated with a significant worse OS than tumor infiltration of 1 hemisphere (P = 0.039). Mean Ki67 proliferation index increased to 18% when both hemispheres were infiltrated. Multivariate analysis for OS revealed IDH 1/2 wildtype (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.3), higher age (aOR 4.2), unmethylated MGMT promotor (aOR 3.5), preoperative KPS score <70 (aOR 1.9), and multifocality (aOR 2.1) as independent parameters for worse survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms well-known parameters like MGMT promoter methylation, IDH 1/2 mutational status, KPS, and age as independent prognostic factors for survival and reveals multifocality as further independent prognostic marker for survival. The dismal prognosis of multifocal involvement is associated with an increasing Ki67 proliferation index.

AB OBJECTIVE: Vertebrovertebral fistulas (VVFs) are uncommon lesions that can arise spontaneously or secondarily to iatrogenic or mechanical trauma. We performed a systematic review of the literature to obtain information regarding demographics, clinical presentation, treatment modalities, outcome, and complications associated with treatment.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed by a reference librarian and after screening, 128 case reports and 16 case series were left for inclusion in the review. All possible data were abstracted by 3 authors, results were tabulated, and descriptive statistics (mean, range, and proportions) were reported. No formal statistical analysis was performed as part of this study.
   RESULTS: A total of 280 patients were analyzed. VVFs can be categorized in 3 subgroups (iatrogenic, spontaneous, and traumatic), based on the mechanism of formation, and these different causes share different underlying demographics that bear important treatment considerations. Traumatic VVFs are more commonly seen in young men; the spontaneous form is more commonly seen in young women. Iatrogenic VVFs are more commonly seen in elderly people. Spontaneous VVFs are most commonly located between C1 and C2. Most iatrogenic (n = 39; 57%), spontaneous (n = 106; 82%), and traumatic (n = 53; 73%) VVFs were treated with deconstructive (defined as occlusion of fistula and feeding vessels) endovascular therapy. Overall treatment-related permanent morbidity was 3.3% (9/270) and mortality was 1.5% (4/270).
   CONCLUSIONS: VVFs are uncommon lesions, and treatment is often indicated, even in patients without retrograde venous drainage. When treatment is undertaken, the cause of presentation and associated patient demographics should be considered when planning the treatment strategy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Infection is a life-threatening complication of ventriculostomy. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to develop a cost-effective, evidence-based intervention to reduce ventriculostomy-associated infection (VAI) rates.
   METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients undergoing ventriculostomy insertion between June 2008 and December 2016 were identified, and charts were reviewed. The study period between June 2008 and August 2010 constituted the baseline (phase 1) in which non-antibiotic-coated ventriculostomy catheters were used and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling was done daily. Then, 2 sequential interventions were implemented. Between September 2010 and January 2013, antibiotic-coated ventriculostomy catheters (AC-Vs) were used (phase 2). Then, between February 2013 and December 2016, the frequency of CSF sampling was minimized to twice a week (phase 3). The rates of VAI and operational costs, or cost incurred for the external ventricular drain catheter, antibiotics, laboratory analysis, and CSF sampling supplies, were compared for each phase.
   RESULTS: The average infection rate for phase 1 was 3.3 infections per 1000 device-days. The VAI rates for phases 2 and 3 were 1.6 and 0.8, respectively. The use of AC-Vs and reduced CSF sampling resulted in a VAI rate decrease of 75.8% (P = 0.01). During 2014, there were no VAIs. The intervention produced an estimated $1.02 million in savings for the institution during phase 3. The average projected savings of this intervention was $175 per patient per day and reduced cost by 72%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of AC-Vs in combination with decreased frequency of CSF sampling was cost saving and resulted in a significant reduction in device-related infections.

AB OBJECTIVE: To review the published data to create a more comprehensive natural history of multiple meningiomas (MM).
   METHODS: A review of MM published until now was carried out through a Medline search up to August 2018. The use of the "multiple meningiomas" keyword returned 278 articles, and the characteristics analyzed in our present cohort were searched on those publications. Articles without detailed description of clinical findings, neuroimaging confirmation of tumor multiplicity, follow-up at least of 5 years, and clear description of clinical findings were excluded. We added series to this review.
   RESULTS: 293 patients with MM were analyzed: 220 women and 73 men, with a total of 932 tumors (3.1 tumors per patient). The majority of tumors were located in the convexity (653% to 74.5%). The total number of tumors treated was 429 (43.9%): 338 (78.8%) by surgical resection and 91 (21.2%) by radiotherapy. Histopathologic description was available in 303 of 429 cases, being grade I in 272 (90.3%) cases, with a predominance of the meningothelial subtype (30.7%). Tumor recurrence was described in 32 (8.07%) among 397 and only 10 deaths (3.4%) of 281 reported cases, where this characteristic was evaluated.
   CONCLUSIONS: World Health Organization grade I predominance was observed among multiple meningiomas in similarity to single meningiomas. Only a fraction of MM patients (43.89%) needed treatment. A benign tumor behavior was corroborated by the observed low frequency of recurrence and mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior lumbar fusions are performed to treat various spinal deformities, degenerative diseases, fractures, infections, and tumors. The possibility of episode-based bundled payments for spine surgery necessitates analysis of the factors predicting readmissions and postoperative complications.
   METHODS: Patients undergoing posterior lumbar fusion in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were queried via Current Procedural Terminology codes 22630, 22633, and 22612. Patients were grouped based on discharge destination, either to home/home health care or to a facility. Relevant demographics, comorbidities, perioperative statistics, and predischarge and postdischarge complications were compared. Multivariable logistic regression models for severe postdischarge complications and 30-day read-missions were created with the exposure of nonhome discharge.
   RESULTS: Patients discharged to nonhome destinations were significantly older (68.42 vs. 58.15 years; P < 0.0001), sicker (68.11% of patients had American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification > 2 vs. 44.25%; P < 0.0001), more dependent (5.92% vs. 1.40%; P < 0.0001), and had significantly greater body mass indices (10.60% of patients had body mass index > 40 vs. 7.63%; P < 0.0001) than patients discharged home. Following discharge, patients in the nonhome discharge group experienced higher mortality (0.28% vs. 0.08%; P < 0.0001) and were more likely to experience a severe complication (5.96% vs. 2.85%; P < 0.0001), minor complication (4.59% vs. 1.74%; P < 0.0001), and readmission (8.92% vs. 4.78%; P < 0.0001). Nonhome discharge proved to be a risk factor for both readmission (odds ratio 1.43; 95% confidence interval 1.28-1.60; P < 0.0001) and severe postdischarge complication (odds ratio 1.73; 95% confidence interval 1.52e1.97; P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Nonhome discharge patients experienced higher rates of complications and 30-day readmissions.

AB OBJECTIVE: The number of patients with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) showing comorbidities and/or impaired activities of daily living (ADL) before the onset of CSDH has increased with the recent aging of society. The purposes of this study were to evaluate ADL worsening by comparing premorbid ADL and ADL at discharge and to investigate the effects of pre-existing comorbidity-related clinical factors on the outcomes.
   METHODS: A total of 570 patients with CSDH admitted from 2006 to 2016 were studied retrospectively. Clinical factors, including pre-existing comorbidities, related to outcomes were identified by multivariate analysis. A variation of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using 5 united categories of mRS scores 0/1, 2, 3/4, 5, and dead was used for evaluation of ADL.
   RESULTS: Of 570 patients, 390 (68.4%) had pre-existing comorbidities and 120 (21.1%) showed premorbid impaired ADL (mRS scores 2 and worse). Considering preexisting impaired ADL, ADL deteriorated after CSDH in 92 patients (16.1%), whereas ADL impairment at discharge was found in 173 patients (30.4%). Comorbidities related to ADL deterioration on multivariate analysis were hemodialysis and chronic heart failure. Antithrombotic use for cardiovascular diseases was a predictor of acute-onchronic subdural hematoma, which was the sole common predictor for ADL deterioration and the occurrence of surgical complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CSDH, pre-existing comorbidity-linked factors related to outcomes were hemodialysis, chronic heart failure, and antithrombotic use. Patients with acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma with these factors should be regarded as a high-risk group.

AB OBJECTIVE: We examined the protective effects of hesperidin on cerebral vasospasm by establishing an experimental rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage and performing biochemical, pathologic, and histomorphometric analysis on these data.
   METHODS: Forty albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups of n = 8 in each: group (G)1, no experimental interventions; G2, subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage; G3, subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage and administered saline (100 mg/kg); G4, subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage and treated with low-dose hesperidin (50 mg/kg); and G5, subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage and treated with high-dose hesperidin (100 mg/kg). Subarachnoid hemorrhage was created by injecting 0.15 cc of autologous blood taken from the rat-tail artery and injected into the cisterna magna from the craniocervical junction. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally as twice daily doses for 48 hours. Rats were euthanized at the end of this period.
   RESULTS: No statistically significant decrease was observed in malondialdehyde levels, which is the end-product of lipid peroxidation, among the drug groups (G4 and G5). Thin sections prepared from the basilar artery were examined morphologically. Severe luminal narrowing and vessel-wall thickening were observed in the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups (G2, G3). In the hesperidin-administered groups (G4, G5), it was determined that vessel wall thickness measurements revealed thinner walls than in the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups (G2, G3) and the luminal diameters were significantly larger than in the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups (G2, G3).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that hesperidin has no effect on malondialdehyde-associated lipid-peroxidation activity; however, it might be useful in subarachnoid hemorrhage therapy because of its beneficial effects on vessel wall thickness and luminal diameters.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary adenomas account for 10%-20% of intracranial brain tumors but have greater incidence in elderly patients. We assessed microsurgical treatment for pituitary adenomas in this population.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients >= 60 years of age was identified. Patients were divided into deciles by age for evaluation of variables affecting outcome: 60-70 (group 1), 71-80 (group 2), and >80 years (group 3).
   RESULTS: Two hundred five patients were identified among group 1 (n = 131), group 2 (n = 65), and group 3 (n = 9). Preoperative variables other than age did not differ. Most patients presented with visual disturbance, in 56.5%, 73.8%, and 50% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The next most common indication was headache, followed by endocrinopathy. Tumors were overwhelmingly nonfunctional (P = 0.97) and macroadenomas (P = 0.5) in all 3 groups. Gross total resection occurred in 56.9%-80% of patients, and this rate did not differ among groups. Complication rates of 6.9% in group 1, 9.2% in group 2, and 0.0% in group 3 were observed (P = 0.8). No perioperative mortality was identified. Mean length of follow-up ranged from 8.9 to 28.3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this series of microsurgical resection of pituitary adenomas in elderly patients, good efficacy and safety of treatment were observed. Preclusion of surgical treatment, including open resection, simply because of age is not warranted and instead a comprehensive evaluation of a patient's risk profile and surgical goals should be undertaken.

AB OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) and medial branch block (MBB) are used to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF). We compared the clinical outcomes, radiologic changes, and economic results of MBB with those of VP in treating osteoporotic VCFs.
   METHODS: A total of 164 patients with 1-level osteoporotic VCF were reviewed retrospectively. The clinical outcomes were measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). To compare economic costs between groups, total hospital costs at the last follow-up day were calculated.
   RESULTS: The patients were divided into 2 groups: 72 patients in the conservative group treated by MBB (MBB group) and 92 patients in the group who underwent VP (VP group). The VAS and ODI scores improved significantly within postoperative week 1 in the VP group compared with the MBB group. However, the VAS and ODI scores did not differ between the groups after 1 postoperative year. After 2 years of follow-up, 14 new fractures occurred in the VP group and 3 in the MBB group. The improvement in compression ratio was statistically greater in the VP group than in the MBB group. However, after 2 years the radiologic changes between groups did not differ statistically. After the final follow-up visits, the hospital costs were significantly lower in the MBB group.
   CONCLUSIONS: After 2 years of follow-up, VP and MBB both had similar efficacy in terms of pain relief and radiologic changes. MBB was more cost effective than VP. Thus, MBB alone can be a possible alternative to VP in patients with 1-level osteoporotic VCFs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is a rare and morbid entity, with the prognosis affected by delayed diagnosis and surgical intervention. The correlation between the timing of the intervention and neurological recovery has not been clearly reported. We present a retrospective study of SSEH to determine the correlation between the timing of surgical intervention and changes in the spinal cord signal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the neurological outcome.
   METHODS: The records of 14 patients who had undergone surgical decompression of SSEHs during a 10-year duration were reviewed. The diagnosis was established from the MRI, intraoperative, and histopathological examination findings.
   RESULTS: We identified 14 patients from both centers, 6 of whom were male. Their mean age was 54.1 years. The onset was spontaneous, and 2 patients were receiving anticoagulant therapy. The most common presentation was paraplegia (n = 8), followed by paraparesis (n = 3) and quadriparesis (n = 2). Spinal cord signal changes were demonstrated on all T2-weighted MRI studies. The response to surgery was favorable for 13 of our patients at the 6-month follow-up examination. The spinal cord changes had persisted in 5 patients on the 6-month postoperative MRI scan. All 14 patients, except for 1, had a favorable neurological outcome at the last follow-up examination.
   CONCLUSIONS: Significant neurological recovery after surgical decompression of SSEHs can be achieved, despite the significant preoperative neurological deficits, spinal cord changes on MRI, and delayed timing of intervention.

AB OBJECTIVE: To introduce quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), a novel magnetic resonance imaging sequence, to the field of neurosurgery.
   METHODS: QSM is introduced both in its historical context and by providing a brief overview of the physics behind the technique tailored to a neurosurgical audience. Its application to clinical neurosurgery is then highlighted using case examples.
   RESULTS: QSM offers a quantitative assessment of susceptibility (previously considered as an artifact) via a single, straightforward gradient echo acquisition. QSM differs from standard susceptibility weighted imaging in its ability to both quantify and precisely localize susceptibility effects. Clinical applications of QSM are wide reaching and include precise localization of the deep nuclei for deep brain stimulation electrode placement, differentiation between blood products and calcification within brain lesions, and enhanced sensitivity of cerebral micrometastasis identification.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present this diverse range of QSM's clinical applications to neurosurgical care via case examples. QSM can be obtained in all patients able to undergo magnetic resonance imaging and is easily integratable into busy neuroradiology programs because of its short acquisition time and straightforward, automated offline post-processing workflow. Clinical integration of QSM may help clinicians better identify and characterize neurosurgical lesions, thereby improving patient care.

AB BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, no previous study has described the nationwide epidemiologic features of moyamoya disease (MMD) in China. We describe the epidemiologic features including the relative prevalence, age distribution, gender distribution, and initial clinical manifestations of patients with MMD treated at a single institution in China.
   METHODS: Our cohort included 4128 patients with MMD. Their demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained by retrospective chart review.
   RESULTS: The median age for the onset of symptoms was 30.36 years. The age distribution of patients with MMD was bimodal, with the highest peak detection rate at 35-45 years of age and a smaller peak at 5-9 years of age. The ratio of female-to-male patients was 1:1. The disease occurred mainly in the Han people and was rarely seen in minority nationalities. In our cohort, transient ischemic attack was the most common initial clinical manifestation (48.13%). The other initial manifestations included infarction (22.62%), hemorrhage (16.45%), and headache 230/4128 (5.57%). In north and northeast China, the ischemic type was more predominate while the hemorrhagic type was relatively rare. However, the percentage of hemorrhagic type in East China was higher than anywhere else in China.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed some unique epidemiologic features as the studies previously reported in China, but it also revealed some new sight and tendency about moyamoya in China. As a lack of national epidemiologic studies, this study indicated the outline of moyamoya in China.

AB BACKGROUND: Underestimation of the spinal cord's volume or position during spine stereotactic radiosurgery can lead to severe myelopathy, whereas overestimation can lead to tumor underdosage. Spinal cord delineation is commonly achieved by registering a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study with a computed tomography (CT) simulation scan or by performing myelography during CT simulation (myelosim). We compared treatment planning outcomes for these 2 techniques.
   METHODS: Twenty-three cases of spine stereotactic radiosurgery were analyzed that had both a myelosim and corresponding MRI study for registration. The spinal cord was contoured on both imaging data sets by 2 independent blinded physicians, and Dice similarity coefficients were calculated to compare their spatial overlap. Two treatment plans (16 Gy and 18 Gy) were created using the MRI and CT contours (92 plans total). Dosimetric parameters were extracted and compared by modality to assess tumor coverage and spinal cord dose.
   RESULTS: No differences were found in the partial spinal cord volumes contoured on MRI versus myelosim (4.71 +/- 1.09 vs. 4.55 +/- 1.03 cm(3); P = 0.34) despite imperfect spatial agreement (mean Dice similarity coefficient, 0.68 +/- 0.05). When the registered MRI contours were used for treatment planning, significantly worse tumor coverage and greater spinal cord doses were found compared with myelosim planning. For the 18-Gy plans, 10 of 23 MRI cases (43%) exceeded the spinal cord or cauda dose constraints when using myelosim as the reference standard.
   CONCLUSIONS: Significant spatial, rather than volumetric, differences were found between the MRI- and myelosim-defined spinal cord structures. Tumor coverage was compromised with MRI-based planning, and the high spinal cord doses were a concern. Future work is necessary to compare thin-cut, volumetric MRI registration or MRI simulation with myelosim.

AB OBJECTIVE: The engineered herpes simplex virus-1 G207, is a promising therapeutic option for central nervous system tumors. The first-ever pediatric phase 1 trial of continuous-infusion delivery of G207 via intratumoral catheters for recurrent or progressive malignant brain tumors is ongoing. In this article, we describe surgical techniques for the accurate placement of catheters in multiple supratentorial locations and perioperative complications associated with such procedures.
   METHODS: A prospective study of G207 in children with recurrent malignant supratentorial tumors is ongoing. Preoperative stereotactic protocol magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and catheter trajectories planned using StealthStation planning software. Children underwent placement of 3-4 silastic catheters using a small incision burr hole and the Vertek system. Patients had a preinfusion computed tomography scan to confirm correct placement of catheters.
   RESULTS: Six children underwent implantation of 3-4 catheters. Locations of catheter placement included frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, and the insula and thalamus. There were no clinically significant perioperative complications. Postoperative computed tomography scans coupled with preoperative MRI scans demonstrated accurate placement of 21 of 22 catheters, with 1 misplaced catheter pulled back to an optimal location at the bedside. One patient had hemorrhage along the catheter tract that was clinically asymptomatic. Another patient had cerebrospinal fluid leak from a biopsy incision 9 days after surgery that was oversewn without complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: The placement of multiple intratumoral catheters in pediatric patients with supratentorial tumors via frameless stereotactic techniques is feasible and safe.

AB BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the causes and time of injury for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important for the development of efficient prevention policies. We aimed to study time of injury and relation to alcohol intoxication for moderate-to-severe TBI in a level 1 trauma center in Norway.
   METHODS: From October 2004 to September 2014, 493 consecutive patients (>= 16 years) with moderate (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 9-13) and severe TBI (GCS score 3-8) were prospectively included in the Trondheim TBI Study (222 patients with moderate and 270 patients with severe TBI).
   RESULTS: Mean age was 47 years (standard deviation 21 years). Positive blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was found in 29%, and median BAC was 41.5 mmol/L (inter-quartile range 28.7-54.3), equal to 1.91 parts per thousand. Admissions were more frequent on Saturdays (relative risk [RR] 2.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87-3.80) and Sundays (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.45-3.03) compared with Mondays, and positive BAC was more common on weekends than weekdays (43% vs. 16%). Furthermore, admissions were more frequent in June (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.44-3.55), July (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.31-3.28), and December (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.31-3.28) compared with January. The number of patients with positive BAC was greatest in December (RR 5.75, 95% CI 1.99-16.63), and 70% of these were caused by falls.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that moderate-to-severe TBI admissions display a clear weekly and seasonal variation and that alcohol is an important modifiable risk factor for moderate-to-severe TBI.

AB OBJECTIVE: Anterior communicating artery (ACoA) complex aneurysms are challenging to treat microsurgically. The authors report their experience with microsurgical treatment of ACoA aneurysms and examine the anatomic characteristics of these aneurysms as predictors of outcome.
   METHODS: The authors queried their institution's aneurysm database for records of consecutive patients treated for ACoA aneurysms via microsurgical clip ligation. Data included patient demographics and clinical/radiographic presentation characteristics as well as operative techniques. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at hospital discharge and 6-month as well as 1-year follow-up were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Of 319 ACoA aneurysms that underwent treatment, 259 were ruptured and 60 were unruptured. Average GOS at 1-year follow-up for all patients was 4.6. Average GOS for patients with ruptured aneurysms correlated with Hunt and Hess grade at presentation, presence of frontal hemorrhages, and need for multiple clips during surgery. Notably, 142 (44.5%) of aneurysms originated mainly from the ACoA artery; 12 (3.8%) primarily from the A1 branch; 3 (0.9%) from the A2 branch; and 162 (50.8%) from the A1/A2 junction. Aneurysm projection was superior in 118 (37%), inferior in 106 (33.2%), anterior in 88 (27.6%), and posterior in 7 (2.2%). Patients with aneurysms originating from the A1 segment had worse outcomes. Posteriorly projecting aneurysms were more likely to be unruptured and larger than other aneurysm configurations.
   CONCLUSIONS: The aneurysm's exact location in relation to the adjacent neurovascular structures is potentially predictive of outcomes in the microsurgical treatment of ACoA aneurysms.

TI Antifibrotic Effect of Boric Acid in Rats with Epidural Fibrosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Boric acid; Epidural fibrosis; Laminectomy
ID DIETARY BORON; PROSTATE; MIGRATION
AB BACKGROUND: Epidural fibrosis is a major problem after spine surgery, with some patients having recurrent symptoms secondary to excessive formation of scar tissue resulting in neurologic compression. We used a rat laminectomy model to determine if topical application of boric acid could be helpful in the prevention of epidural fibrosis.
   METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to 2 control and 2 experimental groups (n = 8 for each group). The negative control group received no surgery, and the positive control group underwent laminectomy only. Experimental groups were classified according to the study agents applied onto the dura mater after laminectomy at the L3 level: 2.5% boric acid solution and 5% boric acid solution. The extent of epidural fibrosis was assessed 4 weeks later macroscopically and histopathologically.
   RESULTS: Boric acid reduced epidural fibrosis in rats after laminectomy. The effect of 5% boric acid solution was more pronounced (P < 0.05) compared with the 2.5% solution.
   CONCLUSIONS: The antifibrotic effect of boric acid solution for the prevention of epidural fibrosis suggests that boric acid should be further evaluated in future studies for the prevention of epidural fibrosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea from a lateral skull base defect refractory to spontaneous healing and/or conservative management is most commonly managed via open surgery. Approach for repair is dictated by location of the defect, which may require surgical exploration. The final common pathway is the eustachian tube (ET). Endoscopic ET obliteration via endonasal and lateral approaches is under development. Whereas ET anatomy has been studied, surgical landmarks have not been previously described or quantified. We aimed to define surgical parameters of specific utility to endoscopic ET obliteration.
   METHODS: A literature review was performed of known ET anatomic parameters. Next, using a combination of endoscopic and open techniques in cadavers, we cannulated the intact ET and dissected its posterior component to define the major curvature position of the ET, defined as the genu, and quantified the relative distances through the ET lumen. The genu was targeted as a major obstacle encountered when cannulating the ET from the nasopharynx.
   RESULTS: Among 10 ETs, we found an average distance of 23 +/- 5 mm from the nasopharynx to the ET genu, distance of 24 +/- 3 mm from the genu to the anterior aspect of the tympanic membrane and total ET length of 47 +/- 4 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although membranous and petrous components of the ET are important to its function, the genu may be a more useful surgical landmark. Basic surgical parameters for endoscopic ET obliteration are defined.

AB BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is responsible for many hospital readmissions each year, particularly among postsurgical cohorts. Because early and indiscriminate VTE prophylaxis carries catastrophic consequences in postcraniotomy cohorts, identifying factors associated with a high risk for thromboembolic complications is important for guiding postoperative management.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine VTE incidence in patients undergoing nonemergent craniotomy and to evaluate for factors that predict 30-day and 90-day readmission with VTE.
   METHODS: The 2010-2014 cohorts of the Nationwide Readmissions Database were used to generate a large heterogeneous craniotomy sample.
   RESULTS: There were 89,450 nonemergent craniotomies that met inclusion criteria. Within 30 days, 1513 patients (1.69%) were readmitted with VTE diagnoses; among them, 678 (44.8%) had a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis alone, 450 (29.7%) had pulmonary embolism alone, and 385 (25.4%) had both. The corresponding 30-day deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism incidences were 1.19% and 0.93%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, several factors were significantly associated with VTE readmission, namely, craniotomy for tumor, corticosteroids, advanced age, greater length of stay, and discharge to institutional care.
   CONCLUSIONS: Craniotomies for tumor, corticosteroids, advanced age, prolonged length of stay, and discharge to institutional care are significant predictors of VTE readmission. The implication of steroids, coupled with their ubiquity in neurosurgery, makes them a potentially modifiable risk factor and a prime target for VTE reduction in craniotomy cohorts. Furthermore, the fact that dose is proportional to VTE risk in the literature suggests that careful consideration should be given toward decreasing regimens in situations in which use of a lower dose might prove equally sufficient.

TI Factors Influencing Medical Student Interest in a Career in Neurosurgery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Career; Conference; Education; Medical student; Neurosurgery
ID EXPOSURE; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: Exposure to neurosurgery at the undergraduate level is an important factor in determining future interest in and applications to the specialty. Given the high competition for training posts, this exposure is also becoming an almost essential addition to an applicant's portfolio. We organized a neurosurgical conference aimed at undergraduate medical students. The aim of this study was to determine factors attracting and deterring students from the specialty before and after the conference.
   METHODS: Responses were collected prospectively from students attending a national neurosurgical conference organized by medical students with support from the local neurosurgical unit. Questionnaires were distributed before and after the conference examining students' perceptions of a career in neurosurgery using free-text responses.
   RESULTS: Poor lifestyle or work-life balance was the most important factor deterring students from a career in the specialty both before (29.7%) and after (60%) the conference. The most important factor attracting students to the specialty before the conference was the practical (surgical approaches and techniques) aspect (21.9%). After the conference, the most important attracting factor was the rewarding nature of the specialty (18.9%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The most notable factor deterring students from a career in neurosurgery was work-life balance. Other deterring factors were much less prevalent following the conference. Understanding how exposure to neurosurgery influences students' perceptions is important for developing future initiatives to prevent misconceptions and allow students to make informed choices as well as encourage the right candidates to apply.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare surgical exposure through microsurgical cadaveric dissection of the intercollicular region afforded by the median, paramedian, and extreme-lateral supracerebellar infratentorial (SCIT) approaches.
   METHODS: Ten cadaveric heads were dissected using SCIT variant approaches. A neuronavigation system was used to determine tridimensional coordinates for the intercollicular zone in each route. The areas of surgical and angular exposure were evaluated and determined by software analysis for each specimen.
   RESULTS: The median surgical exposure was similar for the different craniotomies: 282.9 +/- 72.4 mm(2) for the median, 341.2 +/- 71.2 mm(2) for the paramedian, and 312.0 +/- 79.3 mm(2) for the extreme-lateral (P = 0.33). The vertical angular exposure to the center of the intercollicular safe entry zone was also similar between the approaches (P = 0.92). On the other hand, the horizontal angular exposure was significantly wider for the median approach (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: All the SCIT approaches warrant a safe route to the quadrigeminal plate. Among the different variants, the median approach had the smallest median surgical area exposure but presented superior results to access the intercollicular safe entry zone.

AB BACKGROUND:Surgery is the first-line therapy for glioblastoma. There is evidence that extent of resection is significantly associated with patient survival. Unfortunately, optimal surgical resection is usually limited because of the difficulty in discriminating tumor-infiltrated region and normal brain tissue. This study aimed to develop a tool to distinguish between infiltration zone and normal tissue in real time during glioma surgery.
   METHODS:In an in vivo study, C6 glioma cells were implanted into the left cerebral hemispheres of 6 rats to mimic tumorigenesis. A newly designed optical fiber-embedded needle probe was used to measure the autofluorescence of both cerebral hemispheres at various depths 5 days after the implantation. These rats were then sacrificed, and both cerebral hemispheres were removed for histopathologic analysis.
   RESULTS:Comparative analyses of corresponding areas by histopathology and autofluorescence revealed highly significant (P < 0.001) differences among the normal tissue, infiltration zone, tumors, and the contralateral cerebral hemispheres. The area of the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.978, and the sensitivity and specificity of tumor delineation were 93.9% and 94.4%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS:The newly designed in vivo fiber-optic probe can distinguish tumor-infiltration zones from normal brain tissue in this in vivo study. Therefore, it may help neurosurgeons to increase extent of resection without damaging normal brain tissue and thus potentially improve the patients' survival and quality of life.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the subsidence rate in patients undergoing extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF) using data from a 2-year retrospective study to assess the effect of supplemental fixation on the stand-alone procedure.
   METHODS: Demographic and perioperative data for all patients who underwent XLIF for degenerative lumbar disorders between June 2012 and January 2016 were collected and divided into 4 groups: the stand-alone (SA), lateral fixation, unilateral pedicle screw, and bilateral pedicle screw (BPS) groups. The disk height (DH), lumbar lordotic (LL) angle, and segmental lordotic (SL) angle were measured preoperatively and 3 days, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. Fusion was defined according to computed tomography scan.
   RESULTS: There were 126 vertebrae in 107 patients treated. SL angle, LL angle, and DH significantly increased postoperatively in all groups. Although the preoperative and 2-year postoperative DHs in the SA group were similar, the other measures showed significant differences from baseline at each follow-up visit. No significant effects on SL angle or DH were found in any of the groups. A significant difference in the LL angle was found in the BPS group compared with the other groups. At the last follow-up, high-grade subsidence was found in 26.89% of all cases, the fusion rate was 85.71%, and the VAS and JOA scores were significantly improved in all groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental fixation did not significantly influence cage subsidence or SL angle. Only BPS fixation significantly improved the LL angle. The 2-year fusion rate was satisfactory.

AB BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of thoracolumbar structural stability is a formidable challenge for spine surgeons after vertebral body tumor resection. Various disadvantages of the currently used expandable or nonexpandable cages have limited their clinical applications. We sought to develop a novel prosthesis for clinical use and assess its preliminary clinical outcome in reconstruction of thoracolumbar structural stability after spinal tumor resection.
   METHODS: Using data obtained from a retrospective analysis of the morphological characteristics of the thoracolumbar vertebrae and endplates in previously reported studies, we modified the nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide-66 (n-HA/PA66) strut into a novel height-adjustable vertebral body. A retrospective study was performed of 7 patients who had undergone reconstruction of thoracolumbar structural stability with this novel prosthesis from August 2016 to January 2017.
   RESULTS: A novel height-adjustable vertebral body (AHVB) composed of n-HA/PA66 with 2 separate components with a 163 degrees contact surface at each end was manufactured. The height-adjustable range was 28-37 mm. No significant implant-related complications were observed in the process of operation. All patients experienced a significant reduction in pain, with the visual analog scale score decreasing from 7.9 to 4.0. Neurological improvement was assessed using the Frankel grading system after surgery. Postoperative radiographic and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging findings indicated that the operated segment was stable, the outcome of kyphosis correction was good, and no prosthesis subsidence or dislocation was observed.
   CONCLUSION: This novel prosthesis has many advantages in the reconstruction of height, lordosis, and alignment after thoracolumbar spinal tumor resection and has a favorable prospect for clinical application.
