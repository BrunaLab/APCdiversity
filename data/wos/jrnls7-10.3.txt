AB An analysis of the mechanism of formation of composite nanoparticles of Ag/Si shows that it depends on their stoichiometric composition, conditions of condensation and crystallisation. During the crystallisation of the nanoparticle core, eutectics consisting of silver and silicon layers are formed. Diffraction fringes in the nanoparticle core are caused by the formation of eutectic platelets during crystallisation of phase components. Layers of the conductor Ag and semiconductor Si form, creating an electric charge at the boundaries. We demonstrate the dependence of the sizes of these Ag/Si nanoparticles on the rates of heating and cooling of the materials during synthesis.

AB Photodissociation (PD) spectroscopy of protonated guanosine monophosphate (GMPH(+)) ions was performed using IR-laser ablation of droplet beam and quadruple ion trap techniques. Photofragmentation of GMPH(+) gave a protonated guanine ion (GH(+)) as the main product. A wide-range PD spectrum (3.9-5.4 eV) monitored by the GH(+) ion intensity showed four characteristic electronic transitions related to their three different anti glycosyl-bond conformers of GMPH(+) which were identified by their pi-pi* transitions based on time dependent density functional theory calculation. Furthermore, the narrow-bandwidth PD spectrum (4.28-4.33 eV) shows the existence of syn glycosyl-bond conformation with keto form.

AB Two major problems exist in tunable White Light-Emitting Diodes (WLEDs) that are typically composed of blue-emitting chip, yellow- and/or red-emitting phosphors: (1) the unstable hue of blue-emitting chip, and (2) the harsh conditions (such as high reaction temperature and reductive atmosphere) of traditional red-emitting phosphors. In this paper, we explore a sandwich layer WLEDs structure of ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) films + blue-, yellow- and/or red-emitting pervoskite QDs phosphors + UV-emitting chip to solve the issues. Through changing the number of layers of the three QDs, the correlated color temperature (CCT) was tuned from 8658 to 3961 K, indicating the WLED tuning from cool to warm light.

AB The atmospheric chemistry of pyruvonitrile, CH3C(O)CN, was studied experimentally using FTIR smog chamber techniques. All experiments were performed at 296 +/- 2 K and 700 Torr. The rate constants k (CH3C(O)CN + Cl) = (1.01 +/- 0.26) x 10 (-14) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and k(CH3C(O)CN + OH) = (3.02 +/- 1.11) x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) were determined using the relative rate method. NCC(O)OONO2, ClC(O)OONO2, CO and HCN were identified as products from the atmospheric degradation of CH3C(O)CN. The atmospheric lifetime of CH3C(O)CN was calculated to 38 days and GWP(100) to 1.

AB Although soil bioengineering is increasingly used worldwide, the measures being used today are still based on an empirical approach. Most of the existing literature has primarily focused on mechanical soil reinforcement provided by plant roots and the search for available indigenous plant species, whereas wooden structures and aboveground habitat improvements have been poorly addressed in the literature. Nevertheless, it is of great importance to identify and replicate the most durable structural forms and parameters of bioengineering measures, especially during the initial phase of plant colonization. This paper mainly presents an evaluation of the effect of time (restoration ages), structural forms and structural parameters (materials and construction standards) on wooden structural durability and aboveground habitat improvements using soil bioengineering measures in agricultural areas. The results indicate that the wooden structural durability declines over time, and can be impacted by restoration ages, structural forms and structural parameters, whereas, aboveground habitat improvements measures show a positive response to restoration ages and structural parameters. The wooden structural form with multi-row timber piles (e.g., TTP) and structural parameter (e.g., Project A) was significantly more durable than were others. A temporary warning value (restoration age 7, seven years after the completion of the project) for the reconstruction of filled timber piles is proposed, and two approaches are proposed regarding higher survival rate at restoration age one. The structural parameters of Project A showed a significantly better affect only for plant height from restoration age 6 to restoration age 9, and significantly higher amphibian abundance within the same restoration age, which means the measure of A may provide a better habitat than that of B. These results confirm the efficacy of this type of streambank soil bioengineering measure in agricultural areas and indicate its future application, and raise practical and scientific issues regarding structural durability and aboveground ecological restoration for management as well as for studies related to design improvement.

AB Interactions between macrophytes and phytoplankton have been studied extensively in temperate water bodies, but far less attention has been paid to those for emergent macrophytes in the tropics. We investigated the effects of six emergent macrophyte species (Brachiaria mutica, Ipomoea aquatica, Sphagneticola trilobata, Ludwigia adscendens, Pandanus amaryllifolius and Persicaria barbata) on the phytoplankton community of a tropical reservoir using ex situ experiments with multiple planting densities (Treatment 1: 0.108, Treatment 2: 0.24, Treatment 3: 0.40, Treatment 4: 0.58 g dry weight L-1) in 100-L mesocosms. Chlorophyll a (as a proxy of total phytoplankton biomass) and phytoplankton community structure were examined. The initial phytoplankton community (average chlorophyll a: 20.36 +/- 0.69 mu g L-1) was dominated by cyanobacteria: Planktolyngybya, Pseudanabaena and Cylindrospermopsis (average relative biovolume 0.68 +/- 0.03). Over four weeks, L. adscendens (Treatments 3 and 4) and P. barbata (Treatments 2 to 4) significantly reduced chlorophyll a concentrations by 3.29-6.69 mu g L-1 compared to the controls. Comparing species effects over four weeks for Treatment 4, P. barbata significantly lowered chlorophyll a concentrations compared to I. aquatica while there were no significant differences between all other species. All treatments of L. adscendens and P. barbata significantly reduced the relative biovolume of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton communities by 0.19-0.39 compared to the controls. The highestdensity treatments of all six macrophyte species led to significant shifts in the phytoplankton community structure by reducing the relative abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria (Planktolyngbya, Pseudanabaena) and/or increasing the relative abundance of cryptomonads (Chroomonas, Rhodomonas). This study shows the potential of emergent macrophyte species, especially L. adscendens and P. barbata, to reduce total phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacterial dominance in tropical water bodies, and a range of plant densities which were effective.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are essential soil nutrients needed for plant growth and their stoichiometric ratios are important indicators of the elemental balance in soil ecosystem. However, changes in contents and stoichiometric ratios of SOC, N, P and K under different land uses in salt-affected region remain poorly understand. Soils from five land use treatments, including corn cropland (CL), alfalfa perennial forage (AF), monoculture Lyemus chinensis grassland (AG), monoculture Lyemus chinensis grassland for hay (AG + M) and successional regrowth grassland (RG) were used to assess the influences of land use conversion on the contents and stoichiometric ratios of SOC, N, P and K in a salt-affected region, northeastern China. Results showed that conversion of cropland to forage and grasslands increased by 40.42%, 17.66%, 15.71% and 11.5% for SOC, total N, total P and total K contents in 0-20 cm depth, while the effects of land use conversion on these soil nutrients in 20-50 cm depth were very limiting. Similar with these soil nutrients, the influences of land use conversion on soil stoichiometric ratios were higher in topsoil (0-20 cm) than that in the subsoil (20-50 cm), and re-vegetation increased most of the soil stoichiometric ratios due to the increase of soil nutrient contents. The average C:N, C:P and N:P ratios in the study site were 7.4, 21.3 and 3.0, respectively, in 0-20 cm depth, which were relatively lower than the average values in China and global. The C:K, N:K and P:K ratios were relatively consistent in Songnen grassland, which were 2.0, 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. These findings suggested that land-use type is a major factor that affect the contents and stoichiometric ratios of soil nutrients, and re-vegetation on the cropland improves the soil nutrients in northeastern China.

AB Water level management is of great importance regarding conservation and rehabilitation of wetland plants. However, water level requirements (WLRs) of these plants are not well studied. In the present study, we conducted a systematic assessment of WLRs of Carex cinerascens regarding to each life history stage, based on field investigations and a series of simulation experiments in the Yangtze River floodplain. Results showed that C. cinerascens was well developed in lakes with intermittent water level fluctuations. Its rhizomes could not emerge underwater or in water-saturated conditions, and the optimum soil moisture for emergence was 15-30% with air temperature above 6 degrees C. Its growth was prohibited when the whole plant was inundated (i.e. inundation depth > plant height), and when rate of water level change exceeded 1.2 cm/d. Although summer inundation was not essential for C. cinerascens development, it was beneficial to the plant for excluding competitive species. The timing of habitat inundation was suggested to be after May when the plant matured. The timing of rhizome emergence in the second growing season was determined by when the habitat was exposed. With inclusion of temperature limits, the optimum timing of habitat exposure in autumn was October, and the duration of summer inundation was therefore 0-150 days. We finally combined WLRs of each life history stage and established an integrated WLRs model of C. cinerascens in Yangtze floodplain lakes. It is the first time that such a WLRs model was proposed for hygrophytes in lakes. Moreover, we presented a methodology for assessment of WLRs of hygrophytes which can be widely used in riverine lakes as well as other wetlands. Our results provide important implications for water level management regarding the conservation and rehabilitation of wetland plants.

AB Mulberry tree (Morus alba L.) is an effective material available for the remediation and utilization of heavy metal contaminated soil. A three-year experiment was carried out to assess the effects of three mulberry varieties under three planting densities on the removal of Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). Meanwhile, the pollution levels of the farmland by Cd and Pb were also evaluated. Results showed that the soils were strongly to extremely polluted by Cd and moderately to strongly contaminated by Pb. The biomasses of mulberry trees were increased with the increasing planting densities both in 2014 and 2015, except the biomasses of Nongsang 14 in the planting density 30,000 plants/hectare (ha) in 2014. The total biomasses of Yuesang 11 were the highest among the test three cultivars. In addition, the concentrations of Cd and Pb in the root were much higher than those in the stem or branch or leaf. One hectare mulberry shoots could extract 1.92-7.89 g Cd and 9.70-83.58 g Pb every year, respectively. The three mulberry varieties were all not hyperaccumulators for Cd or Pb because both the bio-concentration factors (BCFs) and translocation factors (TEs) were less than 1. These results indicated that mulberry trees can be used as an alternative plant to make use of heavy metal polluted paddy soils and Yuesang 11 may be regarded as a candidate species for phytostabilization of Cd and Pb, with the planting density of 30,000 plants/ha.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the potential of CWs to remove bacteria, including antibiotic resistant bacteria, and antibiotics from livestock (swine production) wastewater. Microcosms were assembled with Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud and feed with wastewater spiked or not with 100 mu g/L of enrofloxacin or of ceftiofur, alone or as a mixture. Wastewater (spiked or not) was treated during twenty one-week cycles. Treated wastewater was collected at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 18 and 20 to evaluate the removal of pollutants, including nutrients, organic matter, metals and added antibiotics, and total cultivable and antibiotic resistant bacteria (enterobacteria and enterococci), which were enumerated in plate culture media. After treatment, a significant reduction in pollutants load (up to 99% depending on the parameter) was observed regardless of the presence of the veterinary antibiotics. Antibiotics were also significantly removed (removal > 90%). High removal rates were achieved for enterobacteria and enterococci bacteria during the experimental period, in the presence or absence of antibiotics (mean removals between 86 and 100%). For antibiotic resistant bacteria initially present in the influent wastewater mean removals > 90% were obtained, and no significant effect of time or of antibiotic presence was observed. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to focus on the removal of enrofloxacin and ceftiofur resistance in faecal bioindicators in CWs fed with livestock wastewater. Results confirm CWs as a green alternative to reduce the risks associated with the release of livestock effluents into the environment.

AB The species dynamics is the feature of the ecosystem succession and is a key issue in the disturbance ecology. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis proposes that the highest diversity is maintained at intermediate scales of disturbance. This hypothesis has been applied to phytoplankton in water-body. It was found out that a low similarity between consecutive water samples is the result of a drastic disturbance, whereas a high similarity indicates a stable condition. To investigate whether the intermediate disturbance hypothesis is applicable to phytoplankton communities in water-body with a pollution gradient, we provided a field test in Changguangxi National Urban Wetland Park in Wuxi, China. We sampled once a month over a span of four seasons. The phytoplankton species were identified, and water quality monitoring was conducted as the disturbance factor in this study, which included the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. We calculated the similarities of phytoplankton species and water quality among the sampling locations and regarded them as the indicators of disturbance to study the impacts of water pollution. Our results indicated that (1) the fitting curves of phytoplankton community diversity and similarity showed unimodal patterns over four seasons, which supported the intermediate disturbance hypothesis; (2) the response of phytoplankton diversity to water quality levels was not clear. When the water quality similarity was plotted against the phytoplankton diversity, there was no unimodal relationship, neither in the particular season nor over an entire year. We concluded that in this study the intermediate disturbance hypothesis was confirmed by the phytoplankton composition similarity, but water quality failed to be an indicator of a disturbance.

AB Ranger uranium mine, surrounded by Kakadu National Park in northern Australia, is about to undertake broadscale restoration of the first of its two pits and cease all mining and processing activities. Over the mine's forty-year life information from two detailed vegetation maps and five significant reference site surveys has been used to assist with closure. All relevant and available data were reviewed and, as a result, biophysical, remote sensing and vegetation survey data, across an area known as the Georgetown analogue, were subsequently analysed in greater detail. Vegetation communities were assessed using cluster analysis, spatial analysis and regional scale fire mapping. Regional floristic patterns were reflected in vegetation survey data, but the frequency of fires in the assessed Georgetown analogue site was significantly lower to the landscape adjacent to most of the mine site. Indeed, reference ecosystems that capture the variability of fire regimes in the area surrounding the mine should be utilised in the future to provide further engineering and restoration guidance for the new landform, determine appropriate understory species and inform pathways for restoration success. Of the 44 over-storey species assessed in this study there is limited information on the propagation techniques for eighteen species, whilst the establishment of more than 40% of the species on unnatural, mine-created substrates is unknown. Therefore, a more complete list of plant species, knowledge of their propagation and establishment requirements, and appropriate spatial patterns are still needed to ensure that the restoration of Ranger Uranium mine will be successful.

AB Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has been successfully used in wetland-based water treatment systems due to its capacity for rapid nutrient uptake, water-column oxygenation, and dampening of sediment resuspension. For Everglades restoration, large engineered wetlands known as Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) rely heavily on SAV-dominated treatment cells, since they have been highly efficient at reducing phosphorus (P) in surface waters to mesotrophic levels (12-25 mu g/L). However, Everglades STAs have strict water quality effluent limits (similar to 13 mu g/L), and many SAV cells are unable to regularly achieve such levels. In shallow aquatic systems, SAV can be a potential source of internal P loading from sediment to the water column via "nutrient pumping" through root uptake and leaf turnover. This mechanism may be an important obstacle to achieving lower wetland outflow P concentrations, but little is known of the interactions between substrate and SAV nutrition under these low-nutrient conditions.
   Soil core microcosms were incubated with or without macrophytes to estimate internal P loading potential in an SAV wetland and test the hypothesis that wetland substrate manipulation in the downstream (outflow) region might have reduced such loads and enabled more reliable delivery of low-P discharges. During six sequential two-week batch incubations, water-column P concentrations above muck soil overlain by accrued marl (typical of substrates in existing SAV-dominated STAs) indicated significantly higher internal P loading and higher macrophyte biomass growth than above either a bare limerock (LR) substrate (representative of a 40-ha pilot substrate manipulation study, where the muck soil was removed to expose the underlying limestone bedrock, i.e., "limerock") or LR with an accrued marl layer (representing post-startup conditions in the pilot, after muck removal and subsequent sediment accumulation under treatment wetland conditions).
   The results suggest that by removing muck soils to expose a LR substrate in the pilot wetland, SAV biomass and tissue P were diminished, thus reducing the potential for internal loading from SAV, which supports our hypothesis. For each of the three substrate types, internal P loading was higher in the presence of a vascular rooted plant, Potamogeton illinoensis, than the non-vascular macro-alga, Chara sp., (both taxa are prevalent in fullscale STAs), while internal loading was not different between Chara and the non-vegetated control. This indicates the role of P mining by rooted SAV. Overall, this study furthers our understanding of the wetland P cycle at near-oligotrophic levels, and is relevant to STA optimization for Everglades restoration.

AB The water and sediment yields of rivers are changing substantially under the impacts of climate variability and anthropogenic activities, which are increasingly becoming an important research topic in the field of hydro-environmental science. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the changes in runoff depth (h), specific sediment yield (SSY), and flow-sediment relationship at multi-temporal scales in the Han River Basin (HRB). The effects of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on SSY were quantified by employing double cumulative curve analysis. The results are as follows: (1) The annual and flood season h and SSY in the midstream (Huangzhuang Station) during the past six decades presented declining trends. The detected change points (i.e., 1968 and 1984) in SSY were linked to the reservoir and dam construction and soil and water conservation programs. The Danjiangkou (DJK) Reservoir impounded water in the flood season and supplied water in the non-flood season, which made the intra-annual distributions of h and SSY more even and the intra-annual variations more moderate in the comparisons between the pre- and post-change periods. (2) The annual and flood-season flow-sediment relationships were fitted with the power function and the sediment productive ability of runoff in the flood season was much greater than that in the non-flood season. The construction and operation of the DJK Reservoir intercepted a significant quantity of sediment; thus, the sediment transported by unit runoff largely declined. (3) The estimated relative contributions of climate variability and anthropogenic activities to the changes in SSY suggested that the anthropogenic activities played a more substantial role in the SSY decline after the transition years. Sustainable development of the HRB will face many challenges as the water and sediment discharges decrease further from the Han River into the Yangtze River. These results will provide a reference for better soil and water resource conservation and draw more attention to strengthen the river basin management.

AB Acid mine drainage (AMD) is an acidic discharge from mining sites that contains elevated levels of metals and sulfate (SO42-). AMD can inflict health and environmental dangers through metal toxicity and physical stress. Current methods for AMD treatment, including chemical or passive biological treatments, are often non-sustainable owing to expense, require continuous maintenance, or are unsuitable for prolonged treatment. Our ultimate goal is to develop a cost efficient and sustainable floating treatment wetland system using vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides). Year-long large- and small-scale hydroponic experiments were used to determine the effectiveness of vetiver for treating AMD-impacted waters from the Tab-Simco mine site in southern Illinois. For the large-scale mesocosmic study, vetiver rafts were suspended in 100-gallon containers. Water quality was monitored by chemical analysis of samples every 28 days and at the end of the experiment (364 days); plant health was monitored by measuring changes in biomass and recording visual changes in root and shoot coloration and morphology. There was higher net removal of Fe (81%) and Pb (81%) with lower removal of Ni (38%), Zn (35%), SO42- (28%), Mn (27%), Cr (21%), Al (11%) and Cu (8.0%). Metals were mainly localized on the root surface as Fe plaques, whereas Mn and Zn showed greater translocation from root to shoot. Furthermore, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure showed that vetiver biomass was not hazardous waste as a result of metal accumulation. From the small-scale experiment, there was near complete removal of SO42-(91%) and metals (90-100%) with the exception of Pb (15%) and Cu (0.0%). These experiments demonstrate that vetiver can effectively remediate AMD-impacted waters over an extended period of time.

AB Landfilling is the most used and worldwide spread method of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal. The disposal of MSW in landfills entails a number of environmental risks and raises concerns about harmful impacts on human health. The presence and number of contaminants should be monitored in each study assessing the impact of anthropogenic activities on the environment, which relate to MSW management. It was hypothesized that the landfill site can disturb the species composition of native vegetation and create space for synanthropic as well as invasive plant species. The aim of the present study is a long-term monitoring of plant community (floristic research) on an MSW landfill, identification of changes in the plant species composition on the landfill, and evaluation of the importance of the identified species for the surrounding ecosystem and for the safety of landfilling. The results demonstrate that MSW landfill creates a very specific environment. Our research shows that the species composition on the landfill is not stable and a place of specific plant succession. The vegetation on MSW landfills is not stable in terms of its species composition and therefore its continual monitoring is needed. This site has a high potential for invasive species, which may alter the species composition of the vegetation in surrounding ecosystems. Species problematic for agriculture were identified, too. It is necessary to pay attention to the species composition of landfill vegetation, possibly even control some species.

AB Soil moisture, salinity, oat growth and yield were explored during the amelioration of reclaimed coastal saline soil using chicken manure, polyacrylamide, wheat straw, and bacterial manure. The field experiment was conducted by six soil treatments: control (CK), application of organic manure (OM); combined application of polyacrylamide and organic manure (PAM + OM); combined application of straw mulching and organic manure (SM + OM); combined application of buried straw and organic manure (BS + OM); and combined application of bacterial manure and organic manure (BM + OM). Soil moisture was found to be decreased gradually during the growing season. Surface soil moisture increased consistently under various amendment treatments compared with CK throughout the growing season, except in the later growing stage of SM + OM treatment. Simultaneously, soil amendment treatments remarkably reduced soil salinity at 0-40 cm depth and decreased surface soil salinity by 68.0-81.4%, 54.6-75.2%, 56.9-78.2%, 55.1-65.7%, and 28.8-53.4% under SM + OM, PAM + OM, BS + OM, BM + OM and OM treatments throughout the growing season. Furthermore, amendment treatments significantly promoted oat growth and yield, as indicated by thicker stem diameters, taller plant height and higher aboveground biomass and yield. Soil salinity was significantly influenced by precipitation and evaporation, and apparently inhibited the growth, aboveground biomass and yield of oats.

AB Restoration and reconnection of floodplain systems provide multiple societal and ecosystem benefits, while providing municipalities the opportunity to attempt alternative approaches to maintain infrastructure protection and function. In some restored floodplains, treated wastewater effluent discharge is redirected over land instead of directly into rivers to allow natural flow and infiltration, to facilitate restoration designs such as levee setback, and to provide additional freshwater to floodplain ecosystems. However, indirect discharge of treated effluent over land may pose risks to surface and groundwater when pollutants like excess nutrients enter the floodplain and undergo transformation. We investigated the consequences for groundwater and surface water quality when effluent was redirected as open water channels over a floodplain surface. In this study, seasonal floodplain nutrient concentrations in groundwater and surface water were observed for more than 5 years as a floodplain and wastewater treatment plant underwent a major restoration project that included river-floodplain reconnection with levee setback and redirection of effluent discharge from a river channel to open flow across the restored floodplain. Nutrient loading to the surrounding floodplain groundwater and surface water was observed, but based on measures of hydrological connectivity, groundwater flow paths, and biogeochemistry, nutrients from the effluent moved within the floodplain with minimal effect to the surrounding floodplain water quality. We did not find evidence of substantial additional processing that could replace advanced nutrient treatment in this system, however we did observe evidence of diverse nutrient processes that may support enhanced retention if treatment channels were designed to enhance these processes. We suggest that indirect discharge of high quality treated effluent in a restored floodplain is a viable alternative to direct discharge into a river when groundwater flow directs that discharge to habitats where minimal nutrient sensitivity is expected.

AB Although the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been widely used in temperate regions, the performance of its soil temperature module has not been extensively assessed. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the performance of the SWAT model's built-in empirical soil temperature module and a physically-based soil temperature module using four years of daily soil temperature measurements at three depths (i.e., 5, 10, and 50 cm) across 10 monitoring stations in and around the Choptank River Watershed, Maryland, USA. Model performance is assessed according to three coefficients of accuracy, i.e., Bias, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), and coefficient of determination (R-2). Model performance of SWAT and the modified version of SWAT (i.e., MSWAT; equipped with the physically-based soil temperature module) is also compared in winter and nonwinter seasons. Results show that R-2 and NS for different soil depths across 10 stations are all greater than 0.95 and 0.90, respectively, for both SWAT and MSWAT. This indicates that both SWAT and MSWAT reproduce well variations of measured soil temperatures at all soil depths for all stations. The results also show that SWAT and MSWAT tend to underestimate soil temperatures in both winter and non-winter seasons at all soil depths across 10 stations, and MSWAT improves soil temperature simulation by reducing absolute values of Bias, especially at surface soil layers in winter. We found out that a better representation of surface residue is needed in the physically-based soil temperature module for applications in agricultural watersheds of temperature regions. Without a physical accounting, a calibration procedure may be required to account for residue effects on heat transfer based on the current version of the physically-based module.

AB Deterioration of soil physical quality and depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) are widespread challenges in tropical rice-wheat growing regions. Consequently, soil productive capacity, production sustainability, and resource use efficiency have declined in this agro-ecosystem. Ecological engineering approach such as legume inclusion in cropping system offers several ecosystem services, and thus, may serve an important role in the restoration of soil health. Given that, a long-term (2003-2015) field experiment was conducted to assess the impact of four rice-based crop rotation treatments [rice-wheat, rice-chickpea, rice-wheat-mungbean, rice-wheat-rice-chickpea] each with three levels of nutrient management treatments [control, integrated nutrient management, chemical fertilizers] on soil aggregation, soil carbon pools, and carbon stabilization. Legume inclusive rotations increased water stable macro-aggregates (WSMA) over rice-wheat rotation in both surface (0-0.2 m) and subsurface (0.2-0.4 m) soil depths. In surface soil, WSMA was the highest in rice-wheat-mungbean rotation (65%) followed by rice-chickpea rotation (57%) and was the least in rice-wheat rotation (50%). Subsequently, grain legume inclusive rotations had the higher aggregate ratio and mean weight diameter over rice-wheat rotation, being the highest in rice-wheat-mungbean rotation. Rice-wheat-mungbean and rice-chickpea rotations had higher carbon concentration in coarse macro-aggregates, meso-aggregates, and coarse micro-aggregates as compared with rice-wheat rotation. Grain legume inclusive rotations increased active carbon pool (9-18%), SOC (6-17%), and carbon management index (5-7%) over rice-wheat rotation, and the order was rice-wheat-mungbean > rice-chickpea rice-wheat-rice-chickpea > rice-wheat. Integrated nutrient management treatment resulted in higher macro-aggregate (7%), mean weight diameter (6%), active carbon pool (22%), passive carbon pool (16%), SOC (20%), and carbon management index (22%) over the chemical fertilizer treatment. Thus, it is concluded that inclusion of grain legume in lowland rice-based rotation and integrated nutrient management could improve soil aggregation, carbon concentration in aggregates, and soil carbon pools in the tropical soils. The study highlights the prospects of strategic designing of legume inclusive rotation/s for rice agro-ecosystem health and its sustainability.

AB Li-doped Ga2O3 one-dimensional nanostructures were synthesized by thermal evaporation. The observation results of morphology show that there are plenty of one-dimensional nanostructures in the sample. Raman spectra of samples show excellent crystallinity and the Raman peaks of the Li-doped Ga2O3 have red-shifted compared to the "undoped" Ga2O3 in the low wavenumber section. Comparing the photoluminescence behavior of the two samples at room temperature, they were found to have blue light emission peaks, but the emission peak of Li-doped Ga2O3 is blue-shifted. Additionally, there is a strong red light emission peak centered at 692 nm in the spectrum of Li-doped Ga2O3.

AB Noncovalent functionalization of iron oxide nanoparticles (ION) with cytarabine anticancer drug (CYT) has been studied at B3LYP and M06-2X functionals using seven different configurations (ION/CYT1-7) and Fe-6(OH)(18)(H2O)(6) cluster model for ION. The energetic stability of seven noncovalent structures was determined by the calculation of adsorption energies. The AIM studies demonstrated that the noncovalent functionalization mainly occurs through intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The reaction between ION and CYT may produce seven different products (IONCYT1-7/H2O). The high barrier of IONCYT2/H2O (via CH2OH) product is lower than that of IONCYT3/H2O (via OH) product and therefore is the preferred pathway for covalent functionalization.

AB This paper reports the first online gas phase detection of absolute concentrations of HONO under engine relevant conditions, during the oxidation of an alkane in the presence of NOx. The detection was achieved at laboratory scale thanks to the coupling of a jet-stirred reactor to a continuous-wave Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy cell. The evidence of the formation of HONO was obtained by comparing measured cw-CRDS spectra with a literature one. The formation of HONO was simultaneously observed with the appearance of another nitrogen compound: NO2. This confirms that HONO could also be formed from NO2 under engine conditions.

AB The generation of ultrashort attosecond pulse requires both an enhanced high harmonic generation and the spectral-phase control. In the present work, an efficient method is theoretically investigated for extending HHG cutoff energy in Br-2 molecule using TDDFT. The effects of molecular orientation and carrier-envelope phase of the laser on the high harmonic spectrum are analyzed. As a result, by the fine modulations of the laser field, the harmonic plateau is enlarged and the position of structure-induced interference minimum shifts. We also provide a physical picture on the intensity dependence of the spectral minima in the harmonic spectra.

AB We apply the first-principles approach to study the structure, mechanical properties and Debye temperature of NiPt2 with two cubic structures (Pa-3 and Fd-3m). The results show that the Fd-3m structure is more thermodynamically stable than Pa-3 structure. The calculated lattice parameter of NiPt2 with Fd-3m structure is a = 5.820 angstrom. The calculated bulk modulus and Young's modulus of Fd-3m structure are 162.4 GPa and 134.8 GPa, which are larger than Pa-3 structure. The high elastic modulus is attributed to the formation of Pt tetrahedron structure. In addition, the calculated Debye temperature of Fd-3m structure is 239.9 K, which is larger than Pa-3 structure (107.6 K).

AB We present the theoretical investigation on tuning pi-spacers in D-pi-A organic dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The validity of three series of conjugate units (12 types) conventionally used in polymer photovoltaics are utilized as the pi-spacers of organic dyes. Our results indicate that the extension of pi conjugation can efficiently improve the absorption intensity. The absorption spectra red-shifts is because the increased pi-spacers significantly destabilize the highest occupied molecular orbital level, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level has negligible changed. Our simulation is expected to assist the design high performance dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells applications.

In this work, two possible configurations of Li-doped ZnO are considered: substitution of Zn by Li atom (Li-zn), and Li takes the interstitial position (Li-i). It is found found that the position and the concentration of Li play an important role in determining the suitable applications for Li doped ZnO. It is also shown that the obtained results are in good agreement with experimental studies.

AB Aqueous ammonia is a potential absorbent for post-combustion carbon capture. Desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) solution is one of key reactions of regeneration of the absorbent. Experimental studies on decomposition of NH4HCO3 solution with and without nano-TiO2 at different temperatures were conducted. Additions of nano-TiO2 into ammonium bicarbonate solutions decrease the apparent activation energy of overall decomposition reaction and accelerate the decomposition of ammonium bicarbonate solutions. Moreover, compared to hydrophilic nano-TiO2, hydrophilic lipophilic nano-TiO2 exerts more significant promoting effects on the decomposition reaction.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with B3LYP/6-31 + G(d,p) level of theory was used to shed light on how bridging core modification affect the charge transport, electronic and NLO properties of Sl-S8? Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) computations using B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, WB97XD and M062X functional were performed to examine photophysical properties. Results indicate that HOMO-LUMO energy gaps in Sl-S8 (3.03-2.61 eV) were found smaller than IC2 (3.11 eV) which results in large NLO response and obvious red shifts than IC2. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis reveals that separation of charge is formed and electrons are successfully moved from donor to acceptor unit. Sl-S8 showed absorbance wavelength in the visible region (388-436 nm) and greater than IC2 (386 nm). An enhanced NLO response was observed in Sl-S8 as compared to IC2. Interestingly, S7 exhibits appealingly large enhancement in NLO response properties with < alpha > and beta(tot) computed 512 (a.u) and 39,664 (a.u) respectively. Hopefully, this theoretical investigation will serve as a springboard for the future experimental studies of these NLO dyes.

AB A pyrene derivative (KB-3) was synthesized and demonstrated as a colorimetric and ratiometric chemosensor for selective detection of fluoride ion with the detection limit of 391 nM. The mechanism of fluoride ion detection is due to the complete deprotonation of NH proton in KB-3 as revealed by H-1 NMR studies. Further, the deprotonated KB-3 is demonstrated for perceptive detection of CO2 gas down to 0.1 ml. Moreover, detection of fluoride using KB-3 is explored to develop INHIBIT type logic gate at molecular level.

AB The cooperative desorption of H2O and CO with 100% selectivity from the co-adsorbed cobalt oxide clusters CoxOyH2OCO+ [(x,y) = (3,3), (5,7), (6,9), and (9,12)] upon photo excitation at 355 nm was identified by mass spectrometry. In contrast, the sole desorption of CO dominated the mass spectra of CO3O3H2OCO+ upon collisional excitation by Xe at a wide range of center-of-mass collisional energies. The experiments and further kinetic modeling proposed the photo-catalytic coupling of H2O and CO on the cobalt oxide clusters. Combined with theoretical studies, a mechanism for the photo-catalytic coupling of dissociatively adsorbed H2O and CO is proposed.

AB In this work, the stereometric 3-D surface topography as well as the optical properties of the Al doped ZnO (AZO), and Al/Cu co-doped ZnO (CAZO) thin films were investigated. These films were deposited with different thicknesses of 50 and 150 nm. The effect of dopants (Al, Cu) and sputtering parameters on the microstructures, crystalline structures, and fractal features were probed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction, and Rutherford back scattering. AFM analysis of 3-D surface texture provided a deeper insight into their characteristics and implementation in graphical models and computer simulation. Studying surface roughness of samples at nanometer scale revealed a fractal structure which confirmed the relationship between the value of the fractal dimension and surface roughness parameters. Moreover, the optical properties of AZO and CAZO thin films and the relationship between their optical band gaps and their varied thicknesses were evaluated by Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry.

AB Detection of ammonia and simple amine species such as methylamine (CH3NH2), dimethylamine ((CH3)(2)NH) and trimethylamine ((CH3)(3)N) is very important due to their industrial origin. This work details an evaluation on whether the fluorographene is a good candidate to sense the existence ammonia and simple amines for detection of fish spoilage? In order to achieve accurate data, the various interaction positions between the gaseous molecules, graphene and fluorographene sheets were studied. Furthermore, the electronic density of states (DOS plots) demonstrated that fluorographene sheet realizes the existence of NH3, CH3NH2, (CH3)(2)NH and (CH3)(3)N species with a more obvious signal (Delta E-g = 0.036, 0.0308, 0.0499 and 0.0191 eV) compared to the graphene sheet (Delta E-g = 0.0015, 0.0006, 0.0041 and 0.0022 eV). So, gained results demonstrates that the fluorographene can be applied as a bioelectronics nose in the various food spoilage sensors especially in detectors of the fish spoilage.

AB Recent experiments have established the glass-forming ability of methylated alkanes. While temperature effects on the glass transition have been extensively studied under ambient pressure, the impact of pressure on molecular mobility at ambient temperature has received less attention. In this work, we use a combination of equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular simulation methods to determine the viscosity of 2,2,4-tri-methylhexane at 293 K and for pressures ranging from 0.1 MPa to 1 GPa, shedding light on the interplay between structural, thermodynamic and transport properties, leading to the increase in viscosity by several orders of magnitude at high pressure.

AB The study aimed to analyze the effects of aging and lifelong training on the main pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and the impact of acute exercise on the expression of these cytokines. Thirty-nine participants were allocated into 3 groups: young (31.8 +/- 3.00 yrs.), middle-aged (54.2 +/- 5.9 yrs.) and master athletes (53.1 +/- 8.8 yrs.) and performed a maximal incremental test on a cycle ergometer. Blood samples were obtained before (Pre), 10 min post-exercise (Post) and 1 h post-exercise (Post 1 h). Mean VO2max was similar for master athletes and youngers and higher compared to the middle-aged group. Resting values of the IL-1 ra, IL-1 beta, IL-4, and IL-8 were higher in master athletes compared to the young and middle-aged groups (P < 0.01), while the highest values of IL-10 and IL-17 were observed for the youngers (29.49 +/- 18.00 pg/mL and 66.24 +/- 23.23 pg/mL, respectively) with the middle-aged group showing the lowest values (2.13 +/- 1.40 pg/mL). Acute exercise effects (Post) were observed for IL-1 beta in the master athletes group, IL-6 in the young group and IL-4 for both groups (P < 0.05). No Post effects were observed for the middle-age group for all cytokines. The TNF-alpha/IL-10 ratio was higher in all moments for the middle-aged (P < 0.05). In conclusion, lifelong training helps to maintain the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, together with IL-10 levels close to those found in young adults.

AB Objective: To evaluate whether the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) level in serum of ischemic stroke patients was associated with their clinical severity and early outcome.
   Methods: During February 2017 March 2018, consecutive patients admitted to our hospital because of first-ever ischemic stroke were identified. The prognostic value of MIF was set for predicting the outcome of these patients at discharge. The results were compared with existing methods, including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and validated indicators.
   Results: 289 patients were enrolled. The serum level of all patients was determined (median: 20.6 ng/ml). At admission, 131 patients (45.3%) were evaluated as minor stroke (NIHSS < 5). When serum level of MIF was increased by each 1 ng/ml, the unadjusted and adjusted risk of moderate-to-high clinical severity was elevated by 5% (OR = 1.05 [95% CI: 1.01-1.09], P = 0.006) and 3% (1.03 [1.00-1.08], P = 0.02), respectively. At discharge, 82 patients (28.4%) had poor functional outcomes. The median serum level of MIF was lower in group with good outcomes than that observed in poor outcomes (19.4[15.8-24.2] vs. 24.0[19.9-29.4] ng/ml; P < 0.001). When serum level of MIF was increased by each 1 ng/ml, the unadjusted and adjusted risk of poor outcomes was elevated by 9% (1.09 [1.05-1.13], P < 0.001) and 6% (1.06 [1.02-1.10], P < 0.01), respectively.
   Conclusions: High MIF levels are independently related to the moderate to high clinical severity in ischemic stroke patients, as well as the poor outcome at discharge.

AB Disease fatality associated with Ebola, SARS-CoV and dengue infections in humans is attributed to a cytokine storm that is triggered by excessive pro-inflammatory responses. Interleukin (IL)-6 acts as a mediator between pro- and anti-inflammatory reactivity by initiating trans- and classical-signaling, respectively. Hence, IL-6 is assumed to provide a target for a broad range of antiviral agents. Available immunosuppressive antivirals are directed to control an often exaggerated pro-inflammatory response that gives rise to complex clinical conditions such as lymphocytopenia. It is known that IL-6, via its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), initiates a pro-inflammatory response while an anti-inflammatory response is triggered by the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). Future antivirals should thus aim to target the mechanism that regulates switching between IL-6 trans- and classical signaling. In this review, we propose that the tumour necrosis factor-a converting enzyme ADAM-17 could be the master molecule involved in regulating IL-6 class switching and through this in controlling pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to viral antigenic stimuli. Therefore, ADAM-17 should be considered as a potential target molecule for novel antiviral drug discovery that would regulate host reactivity to infection and thereby limit or prevent fatal outcomes.

AB There appears to be an associative link between chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the exact nature of the relationship between CHC and CVDs has not been elucidated. We investigated the presence of CVDs and the clinical and laboratory alterations associated with these diseases in CHC patients. Twenty-six CHC patients, 35 individuals with atherosclerosis (Athero) and 27 healthy individuals were examined for risk factors for CVD, lipid profile, atherogenic risk indexes, and insulin resistance (IR). Cardiac biomarkers and the chemokines and cytokines involved in atherosclerosis were also evaluated. A higher prevalence of prior acute myocardial infarction was found in the Athero group. Most CHC patients were infected with the hepatitis C virus genotype 1 and exhibited either no hepatic fibrosis or a mild to moderate liver fibrosis. The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios and C-reactive protein levels were lower in CHC patients than in the Athero group. Further, IR was elevated in the CHC group and associated with the waist circumference. High GDF-15 levels were observed in the CHC group, which were inversely correlated with APOB levels. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CHC patients produced more IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-6 than CAD PBMC but the production of IL-10 and IL-1 beta was similar. CHC and CAD groups presented similar levels of IL-8, MCP-1 and LAP-TGF-beta 1. Increased IR, elevated levels of GDF-15, and high production of atherogenic cytokines can be observed in Brazilian CHC patients without association with diabetes and clinical manifestation of cardiovascular diseases.

AB Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Previous history of knee injury is a significant risk factor for OA. It has been established that low-level chronic inflammation plays a pivotal role in the onset and pathogenesis of OA. The primary aim of this research was to determine if a history of knee joint injury is associated with systemic inflammation. A secondary aim was to determine if systemic inflammation is related to knee pain and joint structure.
   Methods: Differences in serum cytokine association networks, knee joint structural changes (MRI), and self reported pain (i.e., Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain subscale, KOOSPAIN and Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain score, ICOAP) between individuals who had sustained a youth (aged 15-26 years) sport-related knee injury 3-10 years previously and age- and sex-matched controls were examined. Proteins of interest were also examined in an OA rat model.
   Results: Cytokine association networks were found to differ significantly between study groups, yet no significant associations were found between networks and KOOSPAIN or MRI-defined OA. A group of cytokines (MCP1/CCL2, CCL22 and TNF alpha) were differentially associated with other cytokines between study groups. In a pre-clinical rat OA model, serum CCL22 levels were associated with pain (r = 0.255, p = 0.045) and structural changes to the cartilage. CCL22 expression was also observed in human OA cartilage and furthermore, CCL22 induced apoptosis of isolated human chondrocytes.
   Discussion These results suggest that CCL22 may be an early factor in the onset/pathogenic process of cartilage degeneration and/or related to pain OA.

AB Muscular (Le., quadriceps) weakness contributes to disease progression and precedes the appearance of patient reported symptoms, such as pain and perceived physical dysfunction, in knee osteoarthritis (OA). It is unknown, however, if muscular-based and patient-reported outcomes differentially associate with systemic biomarkers reflective of the local mediators in knee OA. The purpose of this study was to identify if muscular-based and patient-reported outcomes differentially associate with circulating superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cytokines in knee OA. Subjects (n = 29) with pain, muscular weakness, and radiographic evidence (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2) of knee OA in the involved (INV) leg were included in this study. Serum Cu/Zn and Mn SOD and cytokine concentrations were measured in fasting blood samples. Pain and physical dysfunction were subjectively assessed and muscle strength (i.e., peak isometric force and torque, and peak isokinetic-concentric knee-extension and-flexion torques) was determined unilaterally in the INV and non-involved (NI) legs. Peak isometric and peak isokinetic-concentric knee-flexion torques in the INV leg correlated with serum Cu/Zn SOD (both p < 0.05). Peak isometric force and torque and peak isokinetic-concentric knee-extension and-flexion torques in the INV leg correlated with serum Mn SOD (all p < 0.05). Pain and dysfunction inversely associated with serum IL-1 beta IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13, and/or IFN-gamma (p < 0.05). Neither SOD associated with pain or dysfunction, and none of the cytokines associated with muscular-based outcomes. We conclude that common outcome measures used in the clinical evaluation of OA differentially associate with circulating SOD and cytokines.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the interleukins (IL) gene may affect the risk of acute pancreatitis. Many epidemiological studies have reported an association between the IL gene and acute pancreatitis risk, but the results remain inconsistent. Given the controversial available data, we carried out a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate and clarify the association between IL gene polymorphisms and AP. A systematic search of studies for this association was obtained from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases until June 1, 2017. We also searched the references of the included studies to identify additional studies. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to pool the effect size. Stata12.0 was used for whole statistical analysis. Fifteen studies that contained 3371 AP cases and 3506 controls were included in final combination. Overall, a significant association was found between the IL-8-251 T/A (rs4073) polymorphism, the IL-10-1082 A/G (rs1800896) polymorphism and the AP risk in four genetic models (homozygote model, recessive model, dominant model, allele model). Meanwhile, individuals with IL-1 beta+3954 C/T (rs1143634, (homozygote model, recessive model)), IL-1 beta-511 C/T (rs16944, (dominant model)) and IL-6-634C/G (rs1800796, (allele model)) polymorphism were associated with an increased risk of AP. No evidence of an association was found between IL and 10-592 C/A (rs1800872) and IL-10-819 C/T (rs1800871) polymorphism and AP risk.

AB Recent advances in tissue engineering highlight biomaterial designs with context-specific growth factors, cytokines and various small molecules to better mimic the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironments. These efforts have led to direct improvements in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions while mitigating undesirable cellular and immunogenic responses. In this short review, we focus on the crucial roles and regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling in biomaterial applications during tissue repair and regeneration.

AB Tea, an aromatic beverage prepared with the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, is well known to contain bioactive polyphenols. Green tea contains mainly catechins such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), while black tea is characterized by the presence of theaflavins. TNF-alpha, which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that activates the endogenous inflammatory cascade, plays a key role in periodontitis. In the present study, we investigated the ability of tea compounds to attenuate TNF-alpha-mediated activation of the host inflammatory response in monocytes/macrophages as well as the protective effect of green and black tea polyphenols on gingival keratinocyte barrier dysfunction induced by TNF-alpha. Tea compounds inhibited both the activation of NF-kappa B and caspase-1 as well as IL-1 beta secretion by monocytes/macrophages. TNF-alpha time-dependently damaged keratinocyte tight junction barrier integrity, as determined by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance and FITC-dextran transport. Green tea extract, EGCG, theaflavins, and to a lesser extent, black tea extract protected keratinocytes against the TNF-alpha-mediated breakdown of barrier integrity. The treatment of keratinocytes with tea polyphenols markedly mitigated the morphological changes of tight junction proteins such as zonula occludens-1 and occludin compared to cells exposed only to TNF-alpha, as determined by immunofluorescence. Tea polyphenols also time-dependently decreased the paracellular flux of TNF-alpha-treated keratinocytes. In conclusion, the ability of tea polyphenols to exert an anti-inflammatory effect and to attenuate the gingival epithelial barrier dysfunction induced by TNF-alpha supports their potential for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease.

AB Metabolically healthy obesity is characterized as a comorbidity-free obesity status, however the exact pathogenetic mechanisms implicated in its transition to unhealthy obesity have not yet been unveiled. Our aim was to investigate the effect of metabolic health on the proteomic profile both in serum and visceral fat of morbidly obese subjects. 28 patients undergoing bariatric surgery were prospectively enrolled. They were divided into two groups: metabolically healthy (MHO, n = 18) and unhealthy (MUO, n = 10) obese patients. 30 biomarkers were measured in serum and visceral adipose tissue with the use of targeted proteomic analysis (Luminex assays). TNF weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) (p = 0.043), TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) (p = 0.037), Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) (p = 0.04), Resistin (RETN) (p = 0.047), Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (p = 0.011) and C-terminal telopeptide (ICTP) (p = 0.022) were up-regulated in the MUO group in the visceral white adipose tissue. Moreover, C-C motif ligand-3 (CCL-3) (p = 0.056), Interleukin-20 (IL-20) (p = 0.04), Prokineticin-1 (PROK-1) (p = 0.028) and TWEAK (p = 0.016) were found to be suppressed in the serum of MHO group. Significant correlations between serum and adipose tissue levels of certain cytokines were also observed, while 16 biomarkers were associated with BMI. Our results indicate metabolic health substantially attenuates the expression of TWEAK, TRAIL, GDF-15, RETN, MMP-9 and ICTP expression locally, in the visceral white adipose tissue, and the expression of CCL-3, IL-20, PROK-1 and TWEAK in the peripheral blood. Intriguingly, different cytokines except for TWEAK- are up-regulated in each site, suggesting that obesity is not a homogenous but a multi-dimensional disease.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate serum interleukin (IL)-17A levels in patients with coronary artery ectasia (CAE), the relationship between IL and 17A and CAE, and to determine the relationship between the severity of coronary ectasia and the level of IL-17A. In total, 41 patients (19 female and 22 male) with ischemic symptoms whose non-invasive cardiac tests were positive for myocardial ischemia, and in whom coronary artery ectasia were detected after coronary angiography, and 45 patients (32 female and 13 male) with normal coronary arteries were included in this study. Echocardiographic assessments were performed. Serum IL-17A levels of all patients were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-17A levels of the group with isolated coronary artery ectasia were significantly higher compared with the control group (4.86 +/- 3.24 and 1.37 +/- 1.56 ng/ml, respectively; p < 0.001). There was no correlation between the levels of IL-17A and the extension of the CAE, but IL-17A levels were high in both groups. CAE patients have significantly increased levels of IL-17A, fibrinogen, and RDW compared to patients with normal coronary arteries. It was demonstrated that increased levels of IL-17A were associated with ectasia formation in CAE patients.

AB Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL-10) is a chemokine involved in trafficking immune cells to inflammatory sites. Numerous studies have reported abnormally high plasma IP-10 levels in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and IP-10 is considered an important pro-inflammatory factor in the HIV disease process. The data regarding the roles of IP-10 in HIV infection required collation; this review summarizes the biological characteristics of IP-10, the positive association between plasma IP-10 levels and HIV disease progression, the effect of IP-10 on human immune cells, and potential related mechanisms. This review provides important insights into the role of IP-10 in HIV monitoring and treatment.

AB In metabolic diseases, like type 2 diabetes (T2D), adipose tissue (AT) is infiltrated by macrophages and other leukocytes - which secrete many bioactive peptides leading to local and systemic low-grade chronic inflammation and - undergoes remodeling and aberrant fibrosis. Granzyme B (GrB) is a serine protease produced by some leukocytes, including cytotoxic lymphocytes and macrophages. It exerts both intracellular apoptotic function and extracellular functions, leading to tissue injury, inflammation and repair. Elevated circulating GrB levels have been found in aging- and inflammation-associated diseases and a role for GrB in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases has been reported. Aims of this study were to investigate circulating GrB levels in T2D patients in relation to their systemic inflammatory profile and to unravel its correlates. For this cross-sectional study, we recruited 51 consecutive T2D patients referring to our diabetes outpatient clinics (Sapienza University, Rome, Italy) for metabolic evaluations, and 29 sex, age and body mass index comparable non-diabetic subjects as control group. Study participants underwent clinical work-up; fasting blood sampling was performed for routine biochemistry and for inflammatory profile (CRP, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, adiponectin, WISP1); serum GrB was measured by Human Granzyme-B Platinum Elisa kit (Affymetrix EBIO). We found that T2D patients had serum levels of GrB significantly higher than the control group (10.17 +/- 12.6 vs 7.2 +/- 14.1 pg/ml, p = 0.03). Moreover, in T2D patients increased GrB correlated with unfavorable inflammatory profile, as described by elevated levels of validated adipokines such as IL-6 (p = 0.04), TNF-alpha (p = 0.019) and WISP1 (p = 0.005). Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analysis showed that increased GrB was associated with T2D diagnosis independently from possible confounders. In conclusion, our results show that increased levels of circulating GrB are associated with T2D diagnosis and correlates with markers of AT-linked systemic inflammation, suggesting a potential role for GrB in the inflammatory and reactive processes occurring in metabolic diseases.

AB Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease caused by infection with Brucella spp. It generates major economic losses in livestock production worldwide. Goats are the principal hosts of B. melitensis, the main infection agent of caprine and human brucellosis. The selection of resistance-related genes is considered one of the best longterm means to improve control to bacterial infection in domestic ruminants. We performed a candidate gene association study to test if six short insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDels) at bacterial-infection related genes influence the resistance to Brucella infection in female creole goats. InDels (IRF3-540: rs660531540, FKBP5-294: rs448529294, TIRAP-561: rs657494561, PTPRT-588: rs667380588, KALRN-989: rs667660989 and RAB5a-016: rs661537016) were resolved by PCR-capillary electrophoresis in samples from 64 cases and 64 controls for brucellosis. Allelic frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls at IRF3-540 and KALRN-989 (p = 0.001 and 0.005). Indeed, the minor alleles (a and k) at InDels IRF3-540 and KALRN-989 were more frequent among controls than cases, providing evidence that these alleles confer protection against Brucella infection. Moreover, IRF3-540 a-containing genotypes (Aa and aa) were associated with absence of Brucella-specific antibodies in goats (p = 0.003; OR = 3.52; 95% CI = 1.55-7.96), and more specifically, a-allele was associated with resistance to Brucella infection in a dose-dependent manner. Also, we observed that the IRF3-540 deletion (a-allele) extends a conserved upstream ORF by 75 nucleotides to the main ORF, and thus it may decrease gene expression by reducing translation efficiency from the main ORF. These results suggest a potential functional role of IRF3-540 deletion in genetic resistance to Brucella infection in goats.

AB Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most important reason of mortality into worldwide. Visfatin is a novel adipokine which was reported increased in metabolic syndrome and obesity. Moreover, it is known that visfatin increases in aterosclerotic endotelial dysfunction. In our study we want to demonstrate how visfatin changes in isoproterenol (ISO) induced MI. Rats were allocated into 4 groups in which each group included 6 rats in this study. 200 mg/kg ISO was administered into rats except control group to induce MI. I. and II. Group rats in 6th hour, III. Group rats in 24th hour and IV. Group rats in 7th day were decapitated. Visfatin was searched in cardiac tissues of all groups by immunohistochemistry stainning. Visfatin and cardiac markers' levels were measured in serum samples. Serum visfatin levels gradually increased in 6th and 24th hour in MI rats compared to controls. In 7th day visfatin levels decreased to control levels. These changes correlated with serum troponin T levels. These findings were supported by immunohistochemistry stainning of visfatin in cardiac tissues. It has been shown that visfatin could be useful in diagnosing MI and may be a biomarker for cardiac ischemia because of increasing in systemic circulation and cardiac tissues in MI like troponins.

AB Although inflammation is emerging as a candidate risk factor in tumorigenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In particular, Interleukin (IL) 13 involved inflammatory diseases and cancers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL-13 have been associated with multiple cancers. The study analyzed genetic polymorphisms in IL-13 aiming to investigate its' potential susceptibility with the NPC. The genotyping of polymorphisms (rs20541, rs1295687 and rs2069744) was examined by Snapshot SNP and DNA sequencing. All SNPs were within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and each appeared in three genotypes in NPC and controls. Adjusted logistic regression showed that the TT genotype of rs20541 increased the risk of lymph node metastasis (TT vs. CC: OR = 2.87, 95%CI, 1.33-6.18, P = 0.007). CT/CC genotypes were associated with the decreased the risk of lymph node metastasis in NPC (CT/CC vs. TT: OR = 0.32, 95%CI, 0.16-0.65, P = 0.002). The concentration of IL-13 was significantly elevated in NPC patients compared with controls (P = 0.012). Moreover, significant differences were detected in the T-C-T haplotype distribution between NPC patients and controls (OR = 2.47, 95%CI, 1.06-5.78, P = 0.031). Our results, the first report, provide evidence that rs20541 polymorphisms may affect the lymph node metastasis of NPC patients in Chinese population.

AB Macrophages are the primary phagocytes in the lungs and a part of the host defense system against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), involved in the primary immune response. While several studies have assessed the effects of resistance to rifampin on Mtb physiology, the consequences of mutations in genes encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) for host-pathogen interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, rifampin-monoresistant (RMR) Mtb and H37Rv strains were used to infect the THP-1-derived macrophages. Realtime quantitative reverse transcription PCR assay was carried out to determine mRNA expression in 84 cytokine and chemokine genes. Production of specific cytokines and chemokines was measured by ELISA assay. In conclusion, the current study shed more light on the fitness cost of RMR strain and the potential effects of rpoB gene mutations on Mtb-host interactions. These results initially demonstrate that the Mtb carrying the rpoB-S450L can modulate macrophage responses to mediate bacterial survival.

AB Aim: This study aimed to investigate the association between salivary levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and gingival inflammation development during an experimental gingivitis study.
   Methods: A three-week experimental gingivitis study was conducted. Clinical recordings of dental plaque biofilm (Modified Quigley Hein Plaque Index, TQHPI) and gingival inflammation (Modified Gingival Index, MGI) were made at specific time points for each of the 42 participants. Salivary levels of MPO, NE, suPAR, MMP-8 and TIMP-1 at the same time points were measured using distinct immunoassays. For data analysis growth curve modelling was employed to account for the time-varying outcome (MGI score) and the time-varying covariates (salivary marker levels, and TQHPI score). Analyses were stratified according to the MGI-score trajectory groups previously identified as 'fast', respectively 'slow' responders.
   Results: Overall, higher MGI scores were statistically significantly positively associated with higher levels of MPO, MMP-8 and TIMP-1. Stratified analysis according to inflammation development trajectory group revealed higher levels of salivary MPO, MMP-8 and MMP-8/TIMP-1 ratio among the 'fast' responders than among 'slow' responders. None of the investigated salivary protein markers was associated with a 'slow' inflammation development response.
   Conclusions: Salivary levels of MPO, MMP-8 and TIMP-1 were associated with the extent and severity of gingival inflammation. While the 'fast' gingival inflammation response was associated with increased levels of MPO, MMP-8 and MMP-8/TIMP-1 ratio, the 'slow' response was not associated with any of the salivary protein markers investigated in this study. Neutrophil activity seems to orchestrate a 'fast' gingival inflammatory response among participants previously primed to gingival inflammation.

AB Objectives: To assess pain-management using auricular acupuncture as an adjunct to ibuprofen and paracervical block during first trimester uterine aspiration, and to assess auricular acupuncture's effect on anxiety.
   Study design: This randomized, double-blinded, three-arm trial enrolled women undergoing uterine aspiration for spontaneous or induced abortion. Study participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive auricular acupuncture, placebo, or usual care alone. Participants in all groups received ibuprofen and paracervical block (usual care). The main outcome was maximum pain reported at the end of the procedure measured using a Visual Analog Scale; we compared those receiving auricular acupuncture to those receiving usual care alone. We also compared auricular acupuncture to placebo and placebo to usual care alone. Finally, we compared the maximum anxiety scores between participants randomized to auricular acupuncture, placebo, and usual care alone.
   Results: We randomized 153 women over 9 months, and analyzed 52 participants in the auricular acupuncture group, 49 in the placebo group, and 49 in the usual care group. The groups had similar baseline characteristics. After uterine aspiration, participants reported median maximum pain scores as follows: auricular acupuncture 39.5 (interquartile range (IQR) 11, 64.5), placebo 70.0 (IQR 40.5, 84), and usual care alone 71.0 (IQR 32, 91.5) (p<0.01). In pairwise comparisons, the median maximum pain score after auricular acupuncture was lower than placebo and usual-care groups (p<0.01 for both). Post-procedure median anxiety scores were 11.5, 31.0 and 44.0, respectively (p=.01).
   Conclusions: Women undergoing first trimester uterine aspiration assigned to auricular acupuncture reported substantially less pain and anxiety than women assigned to placebo or usual care. Implications: Auricular acupuncture may be a useful adjunct to ibuprofen and paracervical block during first trimester uterine aspiration. This approach to managing pain and anxiety could avoid the operational complexities and expenses of sedation and opioid use. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective(s): To compare pain scores during cervical dilator placement prior to dilation and evacuation (D&E) with patient-administered vaginal lidocaine gel versus lidocaine paracervical block (PCB).
   Study design: We conducted an unblinded randomized trial of women >= 18 years of age undergoing surgical abortion at >= 16 weeks' gestation in two outpatient clinics. We randomized participants to receive self-administered lidocaine gel 2% 20 mL intravaginally 15-30 min before procedure initiation or lidocaine 1% 12 mL PCB immediately prior to dilator placement. Participants rated their pain at various time points using a visual analog scale (VAS), including anticipated and baseline pain, speculum insertion, tenaculum placement, cervical dilator placement (primary outcome) and speculum removal.
   Results: We enrolled 72 women and analyzed data for 69 participants. Sociodemographic characteristics and VAS scores at all time points, except for anticipated pain, were similar between groups. The median pain score with dilator placement was 48 mm in the gel group and 61 mm in the PCB group (p=.23). Procedure times for the gel group and PCB group were 3.7 min and 5.2 min, respectively (p<.01). Lidocaine gel was noninferior to PCB for reported pain scores (VAS) with dilator placement, with a difference in means of -8 mm (95% CI -21, 5) favoring the gel.
   Conclusions: Self-administration of lidocaine gel prior to placement of cervical dilators for D&E is noninferior to paracervical lidocaine block for local anesthesia and is a potential alternative to PCB for pain management with osmotic dilator placement. Implications: Lidocaine gel and similar products represent noninvasive, nonpainful methods of local anesthesia for a variety of outpatient gynecologic procedures. Given our noninferiority findings, if gel anesthetics are available, they should be considered as an alternative to paracervical block. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MISOPROSTOL; 2ND; PREGNANCY; TERMINATION; WOMEN; UPDATE; SCAR
AB Objectives: To compare uterine rupture rates in women having a medical abortion receiving gemeprost alone to those receiving mifepristone plus gemeprost.
   Study design: We reviewed the records of women undergoing medical abortion at 13 0/7-236/7 weeks from January 2007 to December 2014 at a single center in Italy. Prior to January 2011, we used gemeprost 1 mg vaginally every 3 h up to a maximum of five doses. After January 2011, we added mifepristone 200 mg orally 24 h prior to the same gemeprost protocol. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of uterine rupture. We compared the outcome between women receiving gemeprost alone with the combination of gemeprost and mifepristone.
   Results: One thousand and sixty-one (58.5%) and 753 (41.5%) women underwent medical abortion in the gemeprost-alone and the gemeprost/mifepristone groups, respectively. Five (0.47%) uterine ruptures occurred in the gemeprost and four uterine ruptures occurred in the gemeprost/mifepristone groups, respectively (0.53%) (p=.89). All uterine ruptures occurred in women with prior cesarean delivery.
   Conclusions: We rep orted no difference in the incidence of uterine rupture between the gemeprost-alone and gemeprost and mifepristone groups. Implications: Uterine rupture is a rare complication of second-trimester medical abortion with gemeprost. Use of mifepristone prior to gemeprost does not affect this risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ID ABORTION; WOMEN; SERVICES
AB Objective: To evaluate which characteristics collected at the point of abortion are associated with contraceptive use over the extended postabortion period for women in Cambodia.
   Methods: The study includes a cohort of 500 women who attended a Marie Stopes International Cambodia clinic for an induced abortion. The primary outcomes are use of effective contraception >= 80% of the time over the 4- and 12-month period postabortion. We conducted a bivariate analysis to assess the association between each characteristic and the outcome, followed by multivariable modeling to identify the strongest predictors of the outcomes.
   Results: Nearly 44% of the women used contraception for more than 80% of the time during both follow-up periods. Several sociodemographic and reproductive factors were crudely associated with the outcomes. In the multivariable model, prior use of contraception, intention to use postabortion contraception, increased number of children and medical abortion were associated with increased contraceptive use over the year postabortion. Occupation was a predictor at 4 months only, and abortion method was a predictor at 12 months only.
   Conclusions: The models were satisfactory in predicting the outcome of contraceptive continuation both at 4 and 12 months. The paper sets out a methodology for modeling these predictors that can help inform more client centered counseling and services for women. Implications: Factors known when attending a clinic for induced abortion can help inform more targeted and client centered postabortion family planning counseling and services for women in Cambodia (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI Quantifying disparities in access to public-sector abortion based on
   legislative differences within the Mexico City Metropolitan Area
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Abortion; Mexico; Legality; Socioeconomic status; Travel time;
   Disparities
ID WOMEN; TRAVEL; SERVICES; TERMINATION; MISOPROSTOL; REASONS; STIGMA;
   DEMAND; DELAYS; AGE
AB Objectives: In the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, only women in the city center have local access to legal first-trimester abortion. We quantify how this legislative discrepancy affects access to legal, public-sector abortion across the metropolitan area.
   Study design: In this observational study, we used a dataset representing 67.2% of all abortions occurring between 2010 and 2012 in Mexico City's public abortion program and census population data. We calculate utilization rates for 75 municipalities in the metropolitan area for 2010-2012. We compare utilization between municipalities with and without local legal access, adjusting for differences in sociodemographic drivers of abortion demand. We explore the effects of local abortion legality, travel time and socioeconomic status (SES).
   Results: Women who had to travel into the city center for legal abortions used services at only 18.6% (95% CI 13.3%-33.0%) of the expected rate if they had local access, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. After controlling for travel time and SES, women who lived where abortion is illegal had a 58.6% (95% CI 21.5%-78.1%) reduction in access, and each additional 15 min of travel further reduced access by 33.7% (95% CI 18.2%-46.3%). Women who travel to seek legal abortions are more likely to have completed secondary education compared to other reproductive age women in their municipality (p = <.00001).
   Conclusions: We find that, in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, both living where abortion is illegal and having to travel further to access services substantially reduce access to legal, public-sector abortion. These burdens disproportionately affect women of lower SES. Implications: Both local legality and proximate access are key to ensuring equity in access to public-sector abortion. Legalization of abortion services across the greater Mexico City Metropolitan Area has the potential to increase equity in utilization and meet unmet demand for legal abortion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI Changes in the use of effective and long-acting reversible contraception
   in Vietnam
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Contraception; Long-acting reversible contraception; Population-based
   survey; Prevalence; Vietnam
AB Objectives: To calculate the prevalence and identify correlates of unmet need for contraception and to assess whether prevalence of use of effective contraception and long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) has changed over time among married or cohabiting, reproductive-age women in Vietnam.
   Methods: Study population was drawn from nationally representative Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys conducted in 2000, 2006, 2011 and 2014. Unmet need for contraception was defined as occurring when a fecund, married or cohabiting woman is not using any method of contraception but either does not want children or wants to delay birth for at least 1 year or until marriage. Following the ranking of method effectiveness by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we defined "effective contraception" as implant, intrauterine device, male and female sterilization, injectable, pill, patch, ring or diaphragm. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify correlates of unmet need for contraception in 2014 and Cochran-Armitage trend tests to assess changes in effective contraception and LARC use from 2000 to 2014. All analyses used survey weights to account for the complex sampling design.
   Results: In 2014, 4.3% of married or cohabiting, reproductive-age women had unmet need for contraception. Multivariable analysis showed that age, education and number of children ever born were statistically significant correlates of unmet need for contraception. Use of effective contraception statistically significantly declined from 53.0% in 2000 to 45.7% in 2014 (p<.0001). Similarly, LARC declined from 39.6% in 2000 to 30.0% in 2014 (p<.0001). After adjusting for age, education, residence and having at least one son, these secular trends remained.
   Conclusion: Findings indicate that effective contraception and [ARC use have decreased among married or cohabiting women of reproductive age in Vietnam. Correlates of unmet need for contraception should be used to inform interventions to prevent unintended pregnancy. Implications: Although the prevalence of unmet need for contraception was low (4.3%) in 2014, the use of effective contraception and long-acting reversible contraception declined among reproductive-age, married or cohabiting women in Vietnam from 2000 to 2014. This finding is particularly striking given the economic growth in the nation during this time frame. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Cell phone ownership and modern contraceptive use in Burkina Faso:
   implications for research and interventions using mobile technology
SO CONTRACEPTION

DT Article
DE Cell phones; mHealth; Africa south of the Sahara; Burkina Faso; Family
   planning; Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020
ID SERVICE; MHEALTH; HEALTH; IMPACT
AB Objectives: With over 420 million unique cell phone subscribers in sub-Saharan Africa, the opportunities to use personal cell phones for public health research and interventions are increasing. We assess the association between cell phone ownership and modem contraceptive use among women in Burkina Faso to understand the opportunity to track family planning indicators using cell phone surveys or provide family planning interventions remotely.
   Study design: We analyzed data from a cross-sectional, nationally representative population-based survey of women of reproductive age in Burkina Faso, the Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 Round 4, which was conducted between November 2016 and January 2017.
   Results: Among the 3215 female respondents aged 15 to 49 years, 47% reported cell phone ownership. Overall, 22% of women reported current modern contraceptive use. Women who owned a cell phone were more likely to report modern contraceptive use than those who did not (29% versus 15%). Adjusted for covariates (age, wealth, education, area of residence and marital status), the odds of reporting modern contraceptive use were 68% higher among cell phone owners compared to nonowners (odds ratio=1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.32.1). Method mix was substantially more diverse among those who owned cell phones compared to their counterparts.
   Conclusions: The study shows that cell phone ownership is significantly associated with modern contraceptive use in Burkina Faso, even after adjusting for women's sociodemographic characteristics. These results suggest that cell phone ownership selectivity and associated biases need to be addressed when planning family planning programs or conducting surveys using cell phones. Implications: Cell phones can be used for myriad family planning purposes, from confidential data collection to contraceptive promotion and knowledge dissemination, but ownership bias is significant. A cell-phone-based intervention or population-based survey is unlikely to reach a critical mass of the population at highest risk for unintended pregnancy. (C) 2018 The Authors.

   Georgia: implications for teen pregnancy prevention MH2
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Teen pregnancy; Teen births; Repeat births; Racial disparity;
   Urban/rural; Obstetric shortage
AB Objective: To understand teen birth trends in Georgia by racial and geographic factors.
   Study design: We analyzed overall birth and repeat teen birth rates by race, urban/rural status and adequacy of obstetric care from 2008 to 2016 using vital records from all Georgia counties.
   Results: Overall birth rates among teens analyzed decreased dramatically in Georgia, from 45.63 births per 1000 teens in 2008-2010 to 26.28 per 1000 teens in 2014-2016. Repeat birth rates followed a similar decline, from 9.40 to 4.53 repeat births per 1000 teens over the same time period. These rates decreased in all subgroups of teens but to varying degrees. The difference in birth and repeat birth rates between black and white teens decreased fourfold during this time period, whereas the declines in these rates for teens living in rural versus urban counties and with inadequate versus adequate obstetric care were less pronounced.
   Conclusion: While remarkable reductions in teen birth and repeat birth rates have occurred since 2008, these declines have not been equally experienced by all groups of teens.
   Implications: Our analysis suggests that persistent disparities in teen birth and repeat birth rates exist, particularly in areas with limited or threatened access to reproductive health care. Applying targeted teen pregnancy prevention initiatives to these areas could help ensure equitable health and social outcomes for teens. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   DOMINICAN; CONDOMS; MEN
AB Objective: The study describes maternal and adolescent perspectives on sexual decision making and the role of mothers in shaping use of contraception for the prevention of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among older Latino adolescents.
   Study design: Researchers used a semistructured interview guide to conduct focus group discussions with 21 mother -adolescent Latino dyads (n=42). Latino adolescents ages 17-19 were eligible for the study. We recruited families from the South Bronx, New York City, using area sampling methodology. For analysis of qualitative data, we used the framework method involving open coding, identification of dominant themes, refining of codebooks and indexing.
   Results: Overwhelmingly, results suggest asymmetric priorities and preferences regarding maternal involvement in older adolescent sexual and contraceptive decision making. Mothers primarily employed practices designed to prevent adolescent sexual activity. Most teens reported already having experienced sexual debut and were currently sexually active. Adolescents expressed a strong interest in practical support for sexual decision making, including maternal guidance regarding effective access to and use of contraception. Mothers offered limited guidance or support with such matters. Maternal views focused entirely on the health and social consequences of sex in lieu of specific guidance on contraception for older sexually active adolescents. The findings highlight a missed opportunity for Latino mothers to support their older adolescent children to prevent unplanned pregnancies, SIN and HIV.
   Conclusion: Mothers have the potential to positively shape adolescent contraceptive decision making and behavior. Misalignment of priorities between mothers and adolescents diminishes the potential of reducing adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH) disparities.
   Implications: Mothers are influential in reducing adolescent SRH risk. However, asymmetric priorities among Latino adolescents and their mothers regarding support for SRH reduce likelihood of reducing adolescent negative SRH outcomes and supporting adolescent health. Programs supporting better alignment of maternal guidance and adolescent SRH needs are warranted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   contraception; Postpartum contraception; Postpartum LARC
ID RISK
AB Objective: To describe the prevalence of rapid repeat pregnancy (RRP), defined as repeat pregnancy within 18 months of delivery, in a large health system and to determine the impact of contraceptive method on RRP.
   Study design: Retrospective cohort.
   Results: The prevalence of RRP among patients who delivered in August 2014 (n=804) was 27.2%. After controlling for age and sociodemographic characteristics, women experiencing RRP were less likely to have used long acting reversible contraception (LARC) (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.85, p=.014; RRP in 19% of implant and 18% of IUD users)] and more likely to have been prescribed a progestinonly pill (aOR 5.106, 95% CI 2.157-12.083, p<.001; RRP in 53% of users) compared to women choosing all other reversible contraceptive methods.
   Conclusions: Postpartum LARC decreases the odds of RRP, while a prescription for progestin-only pills is not protective. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective(s): Shared decision making (SDM) has emerged as a useful tool to promote patient-centered communication and is highly applicable to contraceptive decision making. Little is known about how SDM is operationalized in contraceptive counseling. This study aimed to explore and describe how SDM is used in the contraceptive counseling context.
   Methods: We analyzed a selection of transcripts from a larger study of 342 audiorecorded visits in which contraceptive counseling occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area. A previous study team had identified 106 transcripts that demonstrated principles of SDM. We randomly selected 40 transcripts from this group for deeper analysis. We coded transcripts using directed content analysis to understand the process of SDM in the context of contraceptive counseling. We focused on how the previously identified phases of SDM (information sharing, deliberation and decision making) occurred in these visits and identified emerging themes.
   Results: Rather than consisting of distinct phases, our analysis found that, in contraceptive counseling, the information sharing and deliberation stages of SDM were largely integrated in an iterative back and forth process between patient and provider. The final decision-making phase was directed by the patient, who retained the final choice.
   Conclusion: Our analysis found that the use of SDM in the contraceptive counseling context reflected the intimacy and complexity of contraceptive decision making. These findings can be used as a foundation for future work to develop training designed to integrate SDM in a manner appropriate to the context of contraception, including prioritizing patient autonomy and acknowledging preexisting preferences of patients.

AB Gas-phase N-2 adsorption on protonated tryptophan and dipeptides, hydrogen-bonded with methanol, was investigated as a model for molecular cloud formation using a tandem mass spectrometer containing a cold ion trap. The number of N-2 molecules adsorbed on H+ Trp(CH3OH)(m) and H(+)Trp-Gly(CH3OH)(m)(m = 0-3) decreased with increasing number of methanol molecules. The surface of the gas-phase ions was covered by the CH3 groups of methanol upon solvation, which rendered the solvated cluster ions inactive toward N-2 adsorption. The lack of N-2 adsorption on unsolvated H(+)Gly-Trp was ascribed to its compact conformation, which was driven by the intramolecular interactions.

AB New sets of empirical D3 and many-body dispersion parameters to be used with the density-functional tight-binding method have been derived. These sets are aimed at a better description of cell volumes of molecular crystals. The validation of these parameters against the extended data set of molecular crystals resulted in better geometric and slightly worse energetic characteristics. A comparison between the empirical D3 and many-body dispersion schemes in describing the properties of molecular crystals yielded almost identical results. The proposed parameters should serve as a useful tool for further investigations of molecular crystal properties.

AB Molecular dynamics simulations are performed for mixtures of ethylene glycol (EG) and water with EG mass fraction of C-i = 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%. The extensively studied ethanol (EA) and water mixed solutions are also calculated for comparison. Both structure and dynamics properties are analyzed. When the C-i increase from 0% to 100%, the intermolecular structure of solvent-solvent exhibits different degrees of clustering except for EG-EG. The intermolecular structure of EG-EG is not obvious affected by the EG mass fraction until the C(i )is increased to 80%. Intramolecular structure of EG is represented by the dihedral angular probability distribution of OCCO and HOCC, which is mainly determined by the force field rather than the EG mass fraction. In this paper, using General Amber force field, OCCO and HOCC angles show agreement with available experimental data and OPLS-AA-SEI-M force field. EG mass fraction do not affect the probability distribution of OCCO and have a small influence on the t/g probability distribution of HOCC. The dynamics properties of hydrogen bond (HB) breaking is found to decelerate with EG mass fraction increases. The different mechanisms of the longer scale HB lifetimes for EG and EA are also discussed.

AB C-5 and C-6 unsaturated aldehydes are a category of BVOCs released by plants in response to their wounds and stress. In this work, the gas phase UV absorption spectra of trans-2-pentenal (t-2P), trans-2-hexenal (t-2H) and 2-methyl-2-pentenal (2M2P) are determined between 240 and 400 nm, at room temperature and at pressures (1-9) torr. The reported UV absorption cross sections are (cm(2)molecule(-1)sigma(t-2P,)( 330) = (4.86 +/- 0.53) x 10(-20), sigma(t-2H),( 330) = (5.43 +/- 0.57) x 10(-20) and sigma(2M2P,) (320) = (6.62 +/- 0.50) x 10(-20). Their photolysis constants as well as their atmospheric lifetimes toward photolysis were then estimated.

AB The method to evaluate the dihedral angles of a polypeptide using IR absorption spectroscopy was applied to a polyproline type II (PPII) structure. We have prepared (1)PPPPPPG(7)-NH2 with the two successive residues labeled by C-13=O-1(8). The doublet of the C-13=O-1(8) stretching band due to the two successive labeled residues was observed, which comes from the vibrational coupling between the labeled residues. The differences in the peak wavenumber and the intensity of the doublet band were analyzed using the GF matrix method and ab initio molecular orbital calculations. The obtained dihedral angles of the labeled residues were compared with the reported values.

AB The geometry optimizations and evaluation of electronic properties of prism carbon series were performed based on the density functional theory using plane waves with the PBE functional. The most stable structure was a prism-C-5 tube. Since the band gaps of these carbon tubes, as estimated by band structure calculations ranged from zero to 0.96 eV, it is considered that the electronic characteristics change from semi-conducive to metallic with increasing number of carbon atoms per unit cell. Since the activation energies of prism-C-4 and -C-6 tubes are larger than the thermal energy, estimated from k(B)T, these structures can exist at ambient temperatures.

AB A set of NF-kappa B-inducing kinase (NIK) inhibitors was used to develop a molecular docking-based QSAR model by using nonlinear regression method. The accuracy of the QSAR model was remarkably improved by integrating the docking scores and key interaction profiles. Two indole-aminopyrimidine derivatives 32a and 32b predicted as NIK inhibitors were synthesized and biologically evaluated. The significant correlationship between experimental data and MD-SVR model-predicted results were observed. The binding mode of 32a and 32b with NIK were further investigated by dynamic simulations. Compound 32b was proposed as a promising lead for the findings of highly potent inhibitors.

AB We investigated theoretically the thermo-induced spin transition of a nanostructure made of an active spin crossover core surrounded by an inert shell with a misfit of lattice parameters between the two constituents. We demonstrated that (i) the structural and magnetic features of the SCO core are very sensitive to the structural properties of the surrounding environment (ii) The misfit of lattice parameters influences the nature of the spin transition from gradual to abrupt one with an important shift of the transition temperature. (iii) The structural heterogeneity of the nanoparticle affects as well the spatiotemporal kinetics of the thermo-induced spin transition. The mechanical properties of the nanoparticle were as well studied and correlated with the magnetic behaviour of the nanoparticle.

AB In our investigation, we fabricated cuprous oxide/activated carbon fibers (Cu2O/ACF) by depositing Cu2O cubes in situ on the ACF. A possible growth mechanism of Cu2O supported on the ACF is proposed. The adsorption and photocatalytic properties of Cu2O/ACF were studied with Methyl orange (MO) as the target pollutant. The results show that the Cu2O/ACF possessed more excellent adsorption properties than ACF, the adsorption efficiency reached 89.4% after 24 h. The synergetic effect between the Cu2O microstructure and ACF makes the Cu2O/ACF possess good photodegradation properties, the photocatalytic efficiency reached 86.1% after 6 h.

AB First-principles molecular dynamics simulation (FPMD) has been applied to study the ionic structure and electronic properties of Na3AlF6 molten salt. The results show that the main forms of complex ion groups in molten salt are [AlF4](-), [AlF5](2-) and [AlF6](3-), with the proportion of 10%, 60% and 30%, respectively. The electron orbitals near Fermi level are mainly occupied by F-2p and hybridize with Al-3p orbitals, in which electrons are transferred from Al-3p orbitals to F-2p orbitals. The calculation results of Raman spectra on [AlF4](-), [AlF5](2-) and [AlF6](3-) are close to the experimental values, indicating FPMD is applicable to similar molten salt systems.

AB A novel multi-corrosion inhibitors-halloysite nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by stepwise loading 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) and benzotriazole (BTA) into halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), then the insoluble Cu-BTA complex was introduced at the end of HNTs (defined as "Cu-BTA-MBT-HNTs") to control the release rate of MBT and BTA. The prepared Cu-BTA-MBT-HNTs can not only reduce the release rate of MBT and BTA for achieving the sustained release effect, but also an acid-response complex corrosion inhibitors. Moreover, the Q235 steel in 3.5% NaCl + Cu-BTA-MBT-HNTs solution owns high inhibition efficiency. Therefore, the Cu-BTA-MBT-HNTs can be a very promising multi-corrosion inhibitors-halloysite nanocomposite.

AB Inelastic X-ray scattering was measured for copper/ethylene glycol nanofluid at 298 K. The collective excitation of the solvent was analyzed by a generalized Langevin equation. The thermal diffusion coefficient and mu(fast)-and a(structure)-relaxations of the solvent for the nanofluid are larger and faster than those of pure liquid, respectively. The high-frequency sound velocity obtained from momentum transfer dependence of a maximum in the longitudinal current-current correlation function increases with increasing the number of copper nanoparticles. The enhanced thermal conductivity of copper/ethylene glycol nanofluid could be related to the solvent dynamics.

AB Nitrate has become recognized as one of the most common contaminants in surface water. In this study, a hybrid biofilm bioreactor was developed to remove nitrate from surface water. Submerged macrophyte residues Ceratophyllum oryzetorum Kom (C. oryzetorum) harvested from a constructed wetland were utilized as an organic carbon source. The average nitrate removal efficiency and removal rate of the bioreactor were 81.6% and 50.8 g N m(-3)d(-1) within 270 day operation, respectively. The biodegradation kinetics constant of the C. oryzetorum residue was 0.039 d(-1). To eliminate the adverse effect of the bioreactor effluent on surface water quality, aeration was applied after 90 day operation with 15 L min(-1) air at a depth of 0-30 cm inside the reactor, which led to a reduction of 61.6% dissolved organic carbon liberated into the receiving water without decreasing the removal of nitrate. In addition, the change in chemical oxygen demand and its components can affect the abundance of denitrifying genes, nirK and nirS, in the bioreactor. The results suggest that macrophyte residues can act as an effective solid carbon substrate for the denitrifying bioreactor. The proposed denitrifying submerged macrophyte residues bioreactor is an effective technology for nitrate removal from surface water as well as macrophyte litter utilization.

AB Mosses and wildfires are ubiquitous occurrences. Their correlation has been assessed in few studies. Mosses have been pointed as pioneer species in post-fire environments. However, reasons for moss crusting in post-wildfire soils and their ecosystem role in preventing soil erosion have not been quantitatively assessed. Moss crusts have quickly developed after a wildfire in a hillslope of eucalypt plantations, in central Portugal. This study had as the overarching aim comparing post-fire soil erosion and runoff between different moss cover percentages, combined with other protective cover elements throughout the first year after fire. Overland flow, sediment and organic matter losses were examined at micro-plots presenting different moss cover percentages, both between plots (11-46% in average) and across time (0-75%). While development of moss cover tended to increase the runoff response, a moss cover above 67% significantly reduced sediment and organic matter losses by 65% (0.40 Mg ha(-1)) and 34% (0.15 Mg ha(-1)) respectively, especially during the rainiest season. Given that mosses are very fast soil colonizers after wildfires, these results provide clues for considering moss crusts in post-fire management and demonstrate their importance in ecosystem restoration, including prevention of soil loss.

AB Many of the world's lakes in arid endorheic basins are shrinking at alarming rates, reducing habitat and economic benefits. Lakes are commonly recovered by river regulation. However, the scarcity of water has hindered the restoration of lakes in arid regions. There is therefore an urgent demand for insight into efficient and sustainable restoration of lakes. Here a water mass balance model was used to explore the impact of flow regulation scenarios on the restoration area of East Juyan Lake (EJL), which is located in an arid zone of China. Then a fractional water loss index was introduced to examine the water storage efficiency of the lake. Results showed that the lake ecosystem has been effectively restored due to the increased streamflow entering the lake caused by the Ecological Water Diversion Project; the dynamic recovery process of lake area is related to the initial area, and streamflow input and evaporation jointly determine the lake equilibrium. Affected by lake topography, fractional water loss index responded nonlinearly to the lake area. Based on these, we determined the appropriate restoration area of 42 km(2), and a discharge of 0.608 x 10(8) m(3) of water must be maintained continuously every year to sustain this area. This paper has provided an efficient way to restore and manage lakes at their suitable size by river regulation and water transfer projects, which are important in helping policy makers make robust decisions to facilitate sustainable development in arid regions.

AB In recent years, Myriophyllum aquaticum grown on floating beds has been widely applied to the treatment of the malodorous black river water with high nutrient concentrations. This is due to the ability of the effective removal of nutrients by this plant. However, environmental factors such as light and nutrients influence plant growth, which may negatively affect the results of ecological restoration. To test the effects of nutrient levels and light intensity on the growth of M. aquaticum, a 21-day outdoor two-factorial experiment (three levels of nutrient loadings and three light intensities) was conducted from September 3 to September 30, 2016. Results showed that the addition of nutrients had no significant effects on the growth of M. aquaticum. Reduced light intensity led to a decrease in Chlorophyll a concentration in the water column and the growth of M. aquaticum. All growth indicators in the full sunlight treatment were significantly higher than in the shading treatments. The lowest growth was found in the 60% shading treatment. The mean plant height and the number of roots responded significantly to the interaction between light intensity and nutrient level. This study reveals that M. aquaticum planted on the floating beds could grow normally in eutrophic waters and can be used as a restoration technique to treat eutrophic water. However, shading (e.g., riparian trees) may be a major limiting environmental factor to M. aquaticum.

AB Sediment diversions along the lower Mississippi River have been proposed to help slow the rate of wetland loss in Louisiana by transferring sediment from the river to coastal marshes, facilitating wetland accretion. While diversions will provide relief to sediment starved coastal wetlands, they will also deliver significant amounts of nutrients (primarily N as NO3-) to receiving basins with potential for negative water quality impacts. There is a paucity of data on nitrate removal rates in the "near-field" area of diversions, identified as areas in immediate proximity to diversion outfalls. In these environments, well-mixed turbulent water column conditions can impart significant shear stress on the sediment surface, suspending fine grained sediments. It is critical to determine nitrate reduction in this near-field environment to predict the potential impact of N on the receiving basins of sediment diversions. Sediment cores were collected from three sites within a mudflat in an active deltaic setting in coastal Louisiana, representative of sediment in the receiving basins, and subjected to shear stress using a flow-through erosional microcosm system for 24 h. Nitrate reduction rates were 18.7 +/- 20.2, 186 +/- 55.1 and 303 +/- 65.6 mg N m(-2) d(-1) determined under zero, medium and high shear stress conditions of 0, 0.2, and 0.45 Pa, respectively. Nitrate reduction rates were similar to 10-16 times faster as shear stress increased. These results indicate that even under well-oxygenated, turbulent flow water column conditions, nitrate can be significantly reduced through the reworking and resuspension of sediment. This research can help inform diversion models and assist natural resource managers in predicting potential nutrient loads and associated impacts of river diversions on shallow estuarine receiving basins as well as being applicable to other flowing systems.

AB Land use change needs to be considered in hydrological modeling because these affect various hydrologic components as well as sediment and water quality in a watershed. It cannot predict the hydrological phenomena accurately without considering the dynamics of land use changes. Most of the hydrological models reflect invariable land use with time. The LUC module that can be used in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been developed to overcome the issue. To help the user to prepare its input files, the SAWT2009_LUC Tool and LUU system had been also developed as the subsidiary tools. Although these tools can consider the temporal and spatial changes of land use, it has several limitations that cannot consider the period between two or more land uses generated at different years when land use and relative parameters are changing. Thus, this study developed the web-based LUC system with two modules which can supplement the limitation of previous module. Based on the results of this study, it was found that the model performance (streamflow prediction) using the newly developed modules showed an improvement compared with the original model performance. Thus, these modules included in the web-based LUC system are useful to consider the dynamics of land use changes spatially and temporarily and appropriate recession curve characteristics at watershed scales.

AB A constructed, variable-flow treatment wetland was evaluated for its ability to reduce microbial loads from the Banklick Creek, an impacted recreational waterway in Northern Kentucky. For this study, levels of traditional (Escherichia coli and enterococci measured by culture and molecular techniques) and alternative fecal indicators (infectious somatic and F+ coliphage, Clostridium spp. and Clostridium perfringens by culture), potential pathogens (molecular signal of Campylobacter spp.) as well as various microbial source tracking (MST) markers (human fecal marker HF183 and avian fecal marker GFD) were monitored during the summer and early fall through five treatment stages within the Banklick Creek Wetland. No difference in concentrations of traditional or alternative fecal indicators were observed in any of the sites monitored. Microbial source tracking markers were employed to identify sources of fecal contamination within the wetland. Human marker HF183 concentrations at beginning stages of treatment were found to be significantly higher (P value range: 0.0016-0.0003) than levels at later stages. Conversely, at later stages of treatment where frequent bird activity was observed, Campylobacter and avian marker (GFD) signals were detected at significantly higher frequencies (P value range: 0.024 to < 0.0001), and both signals were strongly correlated (P = 0.0001). Our study suggests constructed wetlands are an effective means for removal of microbial contamination in ambient waters, but reliance on general fecal indicators is not ideal for determining system efficacy or assessing appropriate remediation efforts.

AB This study investigated the role of biochar addition on promoting microbial nitrogen transformations in intermittent aerated subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSF CWs) under various influent C/N ratios. The results showed that the wetland with biochar addition achieved relatively higher COD (89-99%), NH4+-N (97-99%) and TN (46-98%) removals. Biochar addition significantly improved TN removal, particularly under low influent C/N ratios (< 7). Besides, the high adsorption characteristic of biochar attributed to the better removal performance of organics and ammonium. Moreover, the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) released from biochar was exploited by fluorescence excitation-emission spectrophotometry and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) combining with UV-Visible spectroscopy and results demonstrated that the adsorption-desorption of organics on biochar and DOM released from biochar were the main contributing factor for enhanced denitrification in SSF CWs.

AB A wide program of fruit tree planting, notably jujube trees, has been implemented in the framework of the panAfrican Great Green Wall (GGW) project to improve food security in arid and semiarid regions. However, the success of such initiatives is highly limited by a low tree growth and high tree mortality rates due to transplant shocks from tree nursery to field. The positive impact of mycorrhiza-based ecological engineering strategies on jujube trees were previously demonstrated in nursery conditions, but field monitoring is necessary to evaluate their sustainability in terms of plant growth and survival. In the current study, local (Tassel) and exotic (Gola) jujube cultivars were tested for their response to mycorrhizal inoculation with the non-native arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis IR 27 and fertilization with rock phosphate. The environmental impacts of both treatments were assessed by characterizing the native AM fungal community in a 13-month-old jujube orchard. Field results demonstrated higher rates of survival and a relative stability of nursery-driven plant benefits of inoculated jujube trees, as well as a potential higher persistence of AM fungal inoculum for the exotic cultivar. The native AM fungal community associated with the local cultivar was the most diverse, but Glomeraceae was predominant in both cultivars. The mycorrhiza-based ecological engineering strategies proposed in this work affected both AM fungal communities, notably Glomeraceae and Gigasporaceae members, but in a higher extent for the local jujube cultivar. Results highlight the strong benefits of mycorrhizal inoculation at the very early stages of tree seedling growth in nursery and their stability in the first year of plantation. Nevertheless, a deeper assessment of mycorrhizal inoculum persistence and spread, and a wider characterization of soil and root microbiome need to be implemented in further field monitoring to better evaluate the environmental impacts.

AB Most types of subsurface flow constructed wetlands include pretreatment units for separation of particulate matter. Due to long retention times of the settled sludge in pretreatment units of small constructed wetlands (CWs), anaerobic degradation processes occur and cause methane emissions into the environment. To minimize methane emissions, small-scale trials were carried out, in order to investigate whether vertical subsurface flow CWs (VF wetlands) are suitable for removal of methane and whether it can be utilized to improve the denitrification rate of VF wetlands.
   The results show that methane was completely removed for surface loads of up to 19 g CH4/(m(2).d). Based on mass balancing, 2% of the fed methane was oxidized with nitrate while 22% were oxidized with oxygen. The major part was attributed to biomass build-up. A correlation between effluent COD load and removed methane load was observed. Published literature indicates that COD accumulation is a result of production of extracellular polymeric substances. Low methane loads have only a slight impact on COD accumulation. It is expected that typical methane loads resulting from pre-sedimentation units may cause effluent COD concentrations to increase by up to 20% for municipal wastewater treatment with VF wetlands. Hence, combined wastewater treatment and methane oxidation was successfully demonstrated, but enhanced denitrification could not be achieved.

AB Ongoing climate change and frequent anomalous thermal events have greatly contributed to the deterioration of coral reefs worldwide, exacerbating declines in coral reef formation and ecosystem service provision. Under this climate change scenario, the development and improvement of restoration techniques will be required to cope with coral reef degradation. This study demonstrates the potential use of direct relocation of coral of opportunity as an effective long-term ecological restoration tool. We assessed coral growth parameters (cm yr(-1)), attachment rate (%), ecological volume (cm(3) yr(-1)), including long-term evaluation of annual live coral cover (%) and calcium carbonate production (kg CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1)) during 5-years (2013-2018) using resilient branching coral Pocillopora spp. The results show a survivorship of 67%, high self-attachment (100%) during the first 6-months, and size augmentation of similar to 167% in growth parameters (2.94-4.47 cm yr(-1)) and similar to 418% in ecological volume. Over the long-term, live coral cover increased from 13 to 28% ( + 4% per year) with an accumulated carbonate production of 14.53 kg CaCO3 m(-2) (similar to 3 kg CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1)) resulting from the restoration process, and we found evidence for high resistance and recovery after periods of thermal anomalies. The data validate the use of direct propagation of corals of opportunity as a one of the most feasible and practical techniques to long-term restoration of damaged and degraded coral reef areas, which may help in their structural rehabilitation, improving coral communities and biodiversity maintenance.

   REINTRODUCTION; ACCURACY
AB Myrica esculenta is a socio-economically important but underutilized keystone species of lesser Himalayas. The population of M. esculenta is declining in lesser Himalayas due to change in male-female ratio, habitat fragmentation, invasion by chir pine, over-exploitation, and an ever-increasing human population - with an increasing demand of land for agriculture, industries, and urbanization. The shrinking habitat along with unknown genetic diversity may hinder the application of conservation and genetic improvement of this species. The present research work was carried out to map the geographical distribution and predict the potential occurrence of M. esculenta in Uttarakhand, India. The Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System (RS & GIS) based technology is utilized for prediction modeling and eco-distribution mapping. In total, 1022 species occurrence geospatial data were recorded for M. esculenta. The field surveys provided wide-range of slope, aspect and elevation of the species. The well distributed geo-coordinates (30.52%) were used in the Maxent model for predicting the distribution. Digital Image Processing (DIP) was done through geo-model tools. The results of Maxent model was found to be highly accurate with a statistically highly significant AUC value of 0.913 +/- 0.020. The Jackknife test revealed temperature seasonality (Bio 4), mean temperature of the wettest quarter (Bio 8), slope and precipitation of driest month (Bio 14) contributed significantly in predicting the distribution. The eco-distribution map, prepared using the LANDSAT-8 satellite imagery, showed 477.26 km(2) geographical area under M. esculenta distribution. Within the total area, 111.17, 260.52 and 105.57 km(2) were observed under very dense, moderately dense and open forest, respectively. The potential distribution area calculated in ASTER - GDEM satellite image was 2017.14 km(2). The satellite-based distribution map would be useful for forest departments, scientists, and researchers to locate actual M. esculenta distribution sites for future in situ and ex situ conservation. This approach could be promising in overlaying genetic diversity values over the map and could be effectively utilized in M. esculenta conservation, restoration and management programmes. The present study provides the first eco-distribution map and generated base-line data of M. esculenta in Uttarakhand, India.

AB The upper reaches of the Swan River estuary (Perth, Australia) has a history of eutrophication-related oxygen depletion, which has contributed to poor water quality and fish deaths. To alleviate hypoxic conditions, a trial side-stream supersaturation (SSS) oxygenation plant was established at Guildford (39 km upstream of the estuary mouth) in 2009. After notable success, a second plant was constructed at Caversham (44.2 km upstream of the estuary mouth) in 2011. Oxygenation plants have more commonly been used to treat deep, freshwater lakes and reservoirs and this is a pioneer application to a shallow estuary. We report on the effect of the Caversham plant on water and sediment condition over a 12-day experiment: before, during and post-plant operation. We monitored several physical and chemical parameters collected from daily longitudinal transects, moored continuous loggers, an acoustic Doppler current profiler and an in-situ sediment microprofiler. Oxygenation immediately improved dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column and the distance over which the effect was observed was strongly influenced by the hydrodynamics of the estuary. After five days of oxygenation, water column dissolved oxygen had increased over a distance in excess of 11.5 km. In addition, oxygenation improved dissolved oxygen concentrations at the sediment-water interface, thereby increasing oxygen fluxes into the sediment. Ultimately, artificially oxygenating the Swan River estuary provides a refuge for fauna while facilitating aerobic decomposition of organic matter and enhancing nutrient cycling at the sediment-water interface. In light of the increasingly critical state of urbanised estuaries world-wide, results from this study highlights 1) the effectiveness of oxygenation in improving water quality and its potential for facilitating ecosystem restoration, and 2) the diversity of environments in which artificial oxygenation can be applied.

The CT was observed within 0.11 ps in ethanol and 0.23 ps in hexane. Due to the stronger polarity in ethanol, the CT is faster than in hexane. The following ISC is determined to be 22.3 ps and 21.4 ps in two solvents, respectively. However, the timescales of ISC are similar in both solvents since the excited energies of the S-1 and triplet states are close.

AB Molecule-based ferroelectrics are a class of highly desirable intelligent materials for their highly variable physical properties, easy and environmentally friendly processing, especial light weight and mechanical flexibility. 4-Aminopyridinium Perchlorate (APP), used to be known as a pyroelectric below 243 K, is first discovered to be a new molecular ferroelectric in this work, which has a perfect electric hysteresis loops with a large spontaneous polarization of 1.0 mu C/cm(2) and a small coercive field of 0.67 kV/cm below 246 K. Owing to the dramatic changes of the protonated cations and order-disorder of anions, the crystal symmetry of APP transforms from P2(1)/c to P2(1) in this first-order phase transition, which is revealed by other measurements, such as differential scanning calorimetry, heat capacity, dielectric anomalies and Raman spectrum.

AB In order to obtain high quality white light, we synthesized yellow phosphors by doping europium and other lanthanoids such as holmium and lutetium. We successfully obtained yellow phosphors with green emissions with a wavelength of 510 nm for Li2SrSiO4 by co-doping europium and holmium. Unlike single doping of europium, a lower reduction temperature seemed to be preferable. When we simulated the chromaticity of white light at 5000 K, achieved by mixing blue light, which was used for excitation, and this phosphor, it resulted in better quality than commercially available products.

AB We report a new efficient analytical representation of the molar enthalpy for gaseous substances. The predicted molar enthalpy values are in good agreement with the experimental data in a wide temperature range for the gases Cl-2, Br-2, and gaseous BBr. The present enthalpy prediction model does not need of a great number of experimental spectroscopy data, and requires only three molecular constants, for which the experimental values can be easily obtained in the literature.

AB The effect of acceptor on static and dynamic first hyperpolarizability, beta, of trans- and cis-isomers of azochromophores AAB-DCV and AAB-TCV is studied. Calculations were performed by MP2 and DFT with three density functionals: M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP and omega B97X-D in gas phase and chloroform. Dynamic first hyperpolarizabilities were calculated by TD-DFT at 1.165 and 0.65 eV. The first hyperpolarizability values for trans-isomers are approximately three times greater than those for cis-isomer; solvent effect is essential comprising 2.7 and 3.2 times growth for static values for AAB-DCV and AAB-TCV, respectively, the corresponding dynamic estimations for beta(tot)(2 omega) being slightly smaller (2.2 and 2.6 times).

AB Core-shell structured Co@Silica@meso-Silica nanoparticles have been synthesized via a layer-by-layer approach. The magnetic cobalt core makes the nanoparticles easy to separate with an external magnetic field. The inner dense silica layer prevents the Co from oxidation and leaching. The outer mesoporous silica presents high surface area and pore volume, endowing the material with superior adsorption properties of organic molecules. The core-shell structure prevents the direct contact of cobalt with living cells, thus enhancing the biocompatibility remarkably. This dual encapsulation provides a golden opportunity to the nanocarrier design with easy magnetic separation, high drug loading, and high biocompatibility.

AB The artificial tissue model always attracts scientists' interest. Herein we proposed a simple yet novel strategy to fabricate artificial tissues on the porous polycarbonate substrate with the help of poly-l-lysine. The prepared artificial tissues formed a barrier between donor chamber and acceptor chamber. Using doxorubicin (Dox) and tetracycline as typical hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, the artificial tissues are found to be suitable for drug screen studies.

AB Misfolding and aggregation of a-synuclein (AS) protein are considered to be causative factors for Parkinson's disease. Herein, we describe molecular dynamics simulations of aggregated AS with beta C-EGCG to better characterize the detailed conformational effects on their inhibitory action. Our results indicate that the binding of beta C-EGCG disrupt the beta-sheet of aggregated AS structure and cause impairment of intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the free energy landscape portrayed the effect of beta C-EGCG directly impedes the formation of aggregated intermediate conformers in AS. Hence, our study could aid in the field of structure-based drug design against the AS disorder.

AB The parameter for measuring the solubility of CO2 in H2O using Raman spectroscopy shows different changing trends with temperature (T) above and below 404 K, due to the distinct temperature dependences of the two main non-tetrahedral water structures. The variable dissolving behaviors of CO2 in H2O could be understood based on the tetrahedral water structures and weak CO2-H2O hydrogen bonds when T < 353 K and the repulsive forces between H2O and CO2 at P (pressure) > similar to 20 MPa but the molecular thermal motions at P <= similar to 20 MPa when T >= 353 K.

AB The photophysical properties are calculated for the dibenzothiophene sulfone substituted with various electron donor moieties:3,7-bis[N,N-di(4-tert-butylphenyl)amino]dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (1L), 2,8-bis[N,N-di(4-tert-butylphenyl)amino]dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (1A), and 2,8-bis[N,N-di(4 methoxyphenyl)amino]dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (2A). It is shown that the linear arrangement of the electron donor substituents relative to the dibenzothiophene sulfone acceptor turns compound (1L) an efficient prompt fluorescent emitter, while the angular arrangement of the substituents decreases the efficiency of prompt fluorescence, but increases the efficiency of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Replacing the auxiliary tert-butyl groups in the donor moieties by methoxy groups leads to an increase in k(ISC) and k(RISC). OLEDs are made with the studied compounds.

AB The CD spectra of dispersion particles with the "re-entrant" packing of ds DNA have been compared to the CD spectra of particles with the cholesteric ordering of these molecules.
   The intercalation of daunomycin (DAU) between base pairs of DNA leads to an appearance of new additional band in the CD spectra. The linking of DNA in the single particles by (DAU-copper) nanobridges transforms the "liquid-like" structures of the both particles into the "rigid" state. These effects prove the existence of the cholesteric structure in "re-entrant" DNA phase.

AB Pseudo-successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (p-SILAR) process was opted for deposition of PbS/CdS and CdS/PbS quantum-dots (QDs) on TiO2 to combine light absorbing tendency of PbS and CdS QDs which evolved significant photocatalytic behavior in TiO2 under visible light irradiation. It was shown that the resultant TiO2/PbS/CdS hierarchical nanocomposite exhibited better photo-electrochemical behavior than TiO2/CdS/PbS, ensuing similar to 42% higher degradation of acid orange-56 than the latter and similar to 65% higher than pristine TiO2. In addition, both nanocomposites resulted promising antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli). Particularly TiO2/PbS/CdS showed much greater inhibition zone (similar to 14 mm) than TiO2 (similar to 8 mm).

AB The existence, thermodynamic stability, and gas phase acidity of two series of dinuclear Lewis-Bronsted superacids (HB2F7, HAl2F7, HAlBF7 and HAs2F11, HSb2F11, HAsSbF11) were investigated on the basis of ab initio MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations. All the systems studied are characterized by large acid strengths manifested by the Gibbs free deprotonation energies significantly lower than that of the sulfuric acid. These results are related to the high electronic stabilities of their corresponding superhalogen anions (natural precursors of superacids). Furthermore, our investigations show that the superacid molecules containing two different central atoms are stronger in the gas phase than their classical counterparts.

AB The basic unsettled problem of CO poisoning of platinum catalyst is addressed with the introduction of single dopant atoms on small cationic platinum clusters. Here, 'Rh', 'Ru' and 'Sn' doped on Pt-n(+) (n = 3 and 4) clusters are investigated under three DFT functional (MN12-SX, M06-D3 and TPSSh) using def2TZVPP basis set. Our findings reveal a notable amount of reduction of adsorption energy equal to 0.3 eV for dopant Sn over dopant Ru and Rh in Pt(3)(+)cluster with MN12-SX functional. Thus, the promotional effect of Sn on N catalyst could be a suitable system for improved CO tolerance.

AB The physical-chemical effects of drugs/lipidic interfaces interactions are still little known, justifying investigations using model systems. Here, we investigated a drug with potential biological activity against microbial and tumorigenic cells, thymol, using phosphatidylserine as cellular membrane models. Surface pressure-area isotherms showed that selected amounts of thymol expand the monolayers and decreased its elasticity. Vibrational spectroscopy and Brewster angle microscopy pointed that thymol adsorbs on the lipid polar heads, affecting the aliphatic chain gauche conformations, causing aggregation at the interface. This indicated distinctive molecular accommodations of thymol along the phospholipidic structures, which is associated to its biological effect in natural membranes.

AB The factors underlying two possible pathways for the Dihydrocostunolide (DHCL) photochemical ring-opening reaction were investigated; the first pathway returned to the ring-closed conformation of the reactant and the second pathway progressed to the ring-opened product. High-level multi-reference DFT methods were used to optimize the two pathways and the density was analyzed using QTAIM and the stress tensor. Oscillations in the chemical character of the fissile bond were found for the first pathway before and after the conical intersection that steered the reaction back to reactant. Conversely, this behavior was absent for the second pathway that led forward to the product.

Further, the attributes such as Bader charge transfer, energy band gap, and average energy gap variation assists in scrutinizing the surface assimilating properties of COCl2 gas on phosphorene nanosheet. Besides, the detection properties of COCl2 gas molecules using the phosphorene nanosheet device are evidenced by the transmission spectrum and V-I characteristics. Thus, the current work establishes the foundation for employing phosphorene nanosheet based molecular device in sensing COCl2 gas molecules.

AB Discovery of tunable localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in boron (B) and phosphorous (P) doped silicon (Si) nanocrystals has opened exciting possibilities for Si-based plasmonics. Here, using computationally efficient time-dependent density-functional theory calculations, we investigate the optical response modulations of B- and P-doped Si NPs as a function of dopant locations (incorporated in the bulk, sub-surface, and surface regions) and nanoparticle size. More specifically, we show that the optical features of doped Si NPs are critically depend on the location of the dopant atom and a maximal spectral intensity enhancement can be achieved via surface doping. We believe that our theoretical findings would help in the emerging field of doped Si-based plasmonics.

AB Photophysical properties of 1-(2'-Hydroxy-5'-Chlorophenyl)-3-thio-5-oxo-1H-imidazo-[3,4-b] isoindol (HCHT) have been investigated thoroughly. Steady state and time resolved absorption and emission measurements in combination with theoretical calculation reveal that the synthesized molecule HCHT shows excited state thiolactim-thiolactum tautomerism through intramolecular hydrogen bonding between donor sulphur atom (-S-H) and acceptor nitrogen (N) atom. This is by far the first example where a sulfur atom is present as donor in an excited state proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Choice of sulfur atom in HCHT decelerates the irreversible ESIPT process compared to its oxygen atom donor analogue as evidence from excited state lifetime experiments.

AB Photostability in solid state is one of the crucial parameters of fluorescent substances for their applications. Different factors during the fabrication processes can significantly affect their photostability. In this work, we prepared N,N'-Bis(2,6-dimethylphen-yl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetra-carboxy-licdiimide (DXP) films by directly spin-casting the precursor solutions of DXP in a mixed solvent (methanol and toluene). We found that the photostability and fluorescence quantum yield of DXP in the final solid films have strong correlation with the ratio between methanol and toluene in the precursor solutions. These results show the importance of the solvent used during the fabrication process and give suggestions for better routes.

AB Helical carbon nanofibers/silica (HCNFs/SiO2) was successfully synthesized using a novel two-step method, namely by low-temperature graphitization of HCNFs and subsequent in-situ grafting of silica nanoparticles (about 36 nm) on incompletely-graphitized HCNFs. The results confirm that the orderly array of graphite layers in local region was obtained after low-temperature graphitization at 1000 degrees C, which provides active growth sites for grafting silica nanoparticle via O-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. Compared with common carbon black (CB) N330 and single-phase HCNFs filler, HCNFs/SiO2 has the maximum of the bound-rubber content (43.3%) in NR system, due to its dual-phase combination of carbon/silica and the sophisticated carbon coil structure.

AB We report the use of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to probe chiral self-assembled twisted nanoribbons from a ferrocene-modified dipeptide consisting of two (L)-amino acids (Fc-FF). Supported by molecular dynamics simulation, the THz absorption peaks at 0.9 THz and 2.7 THz are attributed to distinct characteristic vibrational modes of Fc-FF single crystal. The relative absorption intensity is introduced to characterize the discrepancy in THz peak absorption which originates from symmetry breaking. Combined with the results of scanning electron microscopy, circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, THz-TDS unravels great potentials to distinguish subtle structural changes within chiral self-assembled materials.

AB The performance of the IQA energy partition coupled with approximate two-particle density matrices (2PDMs) was studied. BBC1, BBC2, Muller, and CGA density matrix functionals (DMFs) were used to derive approximate 2PDMs for Cu-2, CuH, and (CuH)(2). All DMFs used result in significant errors in molecular energies compared with those evaluated using exact response CCSD 2PDMs. Using the DMFs to derive approximate 2PDMs leads to noticeably smaller errors in energies of interatomic interactions in the model species and in CuCu binding energies for (CuH)(2). Muller and CGA DMFs are most suitable for IQA evaluation of the strength of CuCu interactions.

AB To assess the performance of our implemented first principles isothermal-isobaric centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) we performed Born-Oppenheimer (BO) CMD simulations in the NPT ensemble for high pressure ices (HPIs) VIII, VII, and X at 270 K. By elevating pressure the crystal system is found to transform from tetragonal to cubic at similar to 30 GPa, accompanying the proton order (ice VIII)-disorder (ice VII) transition observed to occur in our BO-CMD simulations. Moreover, our simulations are proved to be able to reproduce well both infrared and Raman spectra for HPIs in the frequency range above similar to 500 cm(-1).

AB In our previous work (Bubin a al., 2016) it was established that complex explicitly-correlated one-center all-particle Gaussian functions (CECGs) provide an effective basis set for very accurate non-relativistic molecular non-Born-Oppenheimer (non-BO) calculations for vibrational ground and excited states corresponding to the rotational ground state. In this work we advance the molecular CECGs approach further by implementing and testing the algorithms for calculating the vibrational states corresponding to the first rotational excited state (the J = 1 state). The test concerns all bound J = 1 rovibrational states of the HD+ ion.

AB UV-assisted selective etching was proposed to raise the etching rate for rapid fabrication on GaAs without templates. Within the same time, protrusive hillocks stemming from the photochemical etching are obvious higher than that of traditional chemical etching. The hillock height produced by the photochemical etching increases linearly and then gradually decreases with etching time, and the scratch produced by higher load can change into higher hillock after etching. By programming tip traces, various patterns, including pyramidal tips, were fabricated on GaAs surface. This study provides opportunities for fabricating high-quality GaAs-based optical structures and devices with low cost and high efficiency.

A conductive adhesion with low curable temperature, low resistivity and high welding spot adhesion strength was obtained for the conductive treatment of piezoelectric composite material. The welding spot adhesion strength was defined at first time. The conductive and adhesion properties were studied comparing with samples treated by ion sputtering. The conductive adhesive with curing agent of EDA has the lowest resistivity of 1.973 x 10(-4) Omega cm and the highest welding spot adhesion strength of 7.93 MPa.

A total of six detoxication pathways are explored among which gamma-H assisted decomposition pathway is the most favored one. The activation barrier of the rate determining step (RDS) of each assisted detoxication pathways is significantly lower than that of the respective unimolecular pathway. Among two assisting reagents, the assisting capability of ZrO2 is found to be better than that of TiO2.

AB Plasmonic nanostructures made from Earth abundant and low-cost metals have recently emerged as a potential alternative to typical noble plasmonic metals. Here we report a quantum mechanical study of the optical response evolution of bi-metallic core-shell nanorods made of simple-metals Mg, Al and Na atoms. We base our calculations on the computationally efficient time-dependent density-functional theory. We find that core-shell nanorods show rich and enhanced optical properties in comparison to pristine nanorods as a result of the interface formed between the core and the shell regions. Perhaps the most interesting result from our calculation is the dramatic spectral intensity enhancements in the case of core-shell nanorods. We believe that our findings will be helpful in the design of plasmonic devices based on core-shell nanorods made of simple metals.

AB Blockade of the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) is a successful therapeutic strategy in various inflammatory diseases. IL-6 can signal via membrane-bound (classic signaling) and soluble forms (sIL-6R, trans-signaling) of the IL-6R. Trans-signaling is causative for the pro-inflammatory properties of IL-6, and the selective inhibition of this pathway holds the promise to cause less side effects than the global blockade of IL-6 signaling. We have recently shown that the majority of sIL-6R in humans is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound IL-6R, but whether this process is influenced by therapeutic blockade of the IL-6R is unknown. In this study, we show that the monoclonal antibody tocilizumab and a single chain antibody directed against the IL-6R efficiently block IL-6 signaling, but do not prevent the proteolytic generation of sIL-6R.

AB Purpose: To investigate the impact of ovarian stimulation and hormone replacement treatment on key regulatory cytokines in endometrial secretion during endometrium implantation window.
   Methods: Fifty-six patients undergoing ovarian stimulation (OS) with gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist and frozen embryo transfer with hormone replacement treatment (HRT) were recruited. Endometrial secretion aspiration was performed repeatedly during implantation window in natural, OS and HRT cycles of every patient. The concentrations of 17 mediators, known to be involved in human embryo implantation, were assessed by multiplex immunoassay.
   Results: Compared with natural cycle (NC), the concentration of IFN-gamma, G-CSF and IL-8 within endometrium were almost the same following OS and HRT. Furthermore, increased MCP-1 levels were observed following HRT and OS. In addition, an increase in IL-1b, IL-7, IL-17, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-12, IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, IL-5, VEGF and MIP-1b concentrations were found in OS cycle only. The level of GM-CSF was lower in HRT cycle and higher in OS cycle, when compared with NC. Among all 17 cytokines, no correlation was found between cytokine concentrations and serum estradiol and progesterone, while only IL-7 concentration has a low correlation with serum LH level.
   Conclusion: Compared to natural and hormone replacement cycle, patients' endometrium cytokine profiles present an increased inflammatory response following ovarian stimulation.

AB Background: Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), particularly SOCS-3, allow discrimination of patients with active tuberculosis (TB) from healthy subjects in a gender- and age-dependent manner. However, no information is available on whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SOCS-3 gene occur in patients with TB. This study was designed to investigate SOCS-3 SNPs in association with susceptibility to TB in the Taiwanese population.
   Methods: Four SNPs in the SOCS-3 gene located at rs8064821, rs4969168, rs2280148, and rs35037722 were studied by the TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay in 200 healthy and 210 TB patients enrolled in 2015-2018.
   Results: Significant differences were not detected in genotype frequencies or odds ratios (ORs) between healthy and TB patients for any of the four polymorphisms. The lack of significant differences was also found when the patients were stratified by sex. However, males exhibited GG homozygous at rs35037722 in association with susceptibility to TB after the OR analysis was adjusted for age. For rs8064821, AA and AC genotypes were associated with TB susceptibility in patients <= 65 years old compared to CC genotype, whereas older subjects had no such association.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that particular SOCS-3 SNPs are dependent on gender or age to influence TB susceptibility in the Han Taiwanese.

AB Meprin metalloendopeptidases, comprising alpha and beta isoforms, are widely expressed in mammalian cells and organs including kidney, intestines, lungs, skin, and bladder, and in a variety of immune cells and cancer cells. Meprins proteolytically process many inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and other bioactive proteins and peptides that control the function of immune cells. The knowledge of meprin-mediated processing of inflammatory mediators and other target substrates provides a pathophysiologic link for the involvement of meprins in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders. Meprins are now known to play important roles in inflammatory diseases including acute kidney injury, sepsis, urinary tract infections, bladder inflammation, and inflammatory bowel disease. The proteolysis of epithelial and endothelial barriers including cell junctional proteins by meprins promotes leukocyte influx into areas of tissue damage to result in inflammation. Meprins degrade extracellular matrix proteins; this ability of meprins is implicated in the cell migration of leukocytes and the invasion of tumor cells that express meprins. Proteolytic processing and maturation of procollagens provides evidence that meprins are involved in collagen maturation and deposition in the fibrotic processes involved in the formation of keloids and hypertrophic scars and lung fibrosis. This review highlights recent progress in understanding the role of meprins in inflammatory disorders in both human and mouse models.

AB Objective: To search the predictive factors of infliximab resistance in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)-resistant Kawasaki disease (KD) patients.
   Study design.
   Twenty-seven patients with KD who received infliximab after 4-5 g/kg of IVIG therapy from 2013 to 2015 were consecutively recruited in this study. They were divided into two groups: patients who responded to infliximab (infliximab-responsive group, n = 15) and patients who required additional therapy for the disease control (infliximab-resistant group, n = 12). We analyzed the clinical and laboratory parameters just before the infliximab treatment including serum levels of procalcitonin and cytokines with respect to the infliximab response.
   Results: Serum procalcitonin concentration (P = 0.017), neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (P = 0.013), and % neutrophils (P = 0.004) were higher, and serum sodium concentration (P = 0.017) was lower in infliximab-resistant group than those of infliximab-responsive group, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that higher procalcitonin concentration (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-5.00, P = 0.046) and lower sodium levels (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.32-1.00, P = 0.047), but not other variables, were associated with infliximab-resistance. Serum procalcitonin concentrations positively correlated with the serum levels of interleukin-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 and type 2, respectively. Analyses of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the cut-off value of procalcitonin 2.0 ng/ml had 58.3% of sensitivity and 93.3% of specificity. ROC analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.739 to predict infliximab-resistance.
   Conclusion: Serum procalcitonin might be an effective biomarker to predict infliximab resistance in severe KD patients who are refractory to IVIG treatment.

AB Our previous data suggest that the heterodimeric interleukin-27 (IL-27) could participate in the developing of insulin resistance (IR). Our aim was to assess the participation of IL-27p28 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as markers for IR, subclinical atherosclerosis (SA) and cardiovascular risk factors in a Mexican population. Five IL-27p28 SNPs (rs153109, rs40837, rs17855750, rs26528 and rs181206) were genotyped in 856 individuals with IR and 644 participants without IR. Under inheritance models adjusted for confounding factors, the rs153109A (0.78[0.64-0.94] P-additive = 0.008, 0.58[0.41-0.82] P-recesive =0.002, 0.57[0.38-0.83] P-codominant2 = 0.004), rs26528T (0.78[0.64-0.94] P-additive = 0.008, 0.61[0.43-0.88] P-recesive = 0.007, 0.57[0.38-0.84] P-codominant2 = 0.004) and rs40837A (0.76[0.63-0.92] P-additive = 0.004; 0.60[0.42-0.86] P-recessive = 0.005; 0.54[0.37-0.80] P-codominant2 = 0.002) alleles were related with a decreased risk of IR. Moreover, AAATA haplotype that contains the protector alleles was related with 17% lower risk of presenting IR (0.83 [0.71-0.98], P = 0.023). After adjusting for potential confounding variables, IL-27p28 SNPs were not associated with SA. However, some SNPs were associated with hypertension (rs26528 and rs40837) and increased total abdominal fat (rs17855750) in non-IR individuals, whereas in IR subjects we observed an association of rs26528 and rs40837 with hypoadiponectinemia. Our evidence suggests that rs40837A, rs153109A, and rs26528T alleles could be envisaged as protective markers for IR. Some polymorphisms showed an association with hypertension, low adiponectin levels, and increased total abdominal fat.

AB Proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine signaling from the tumor microenvironment is thought to be crucial for developing and sustaining colorectal cancer by regulating a multitude of pathways associated with a variety of cellular mechanisms. Among these pathways there is acquired chemoresistance, which is usually a major obstacle in the way towards successful chemotherapeutic treatment of advanced colorectal cancer cases. Despite of an emerging body of data published on the role of cytokine signaling network in cancer, little is known about the effects of the upstream cytokine interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) signaling to the cancer cells. In this study we have shown that the increase in exogenous IL-1 alpha signaling increases chemosensitivity of both chemosensitive and chemoresistant colorectal cancer cell lines, treated with a widely used cytotoxic antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This was a result of increased cell death but not of the changes in 5-FU-induced cell cycle arrest. Noticeably, combined exogenous IL-1 alpha and 5-FU treatment had significant effects on the expression of cell adhesion molecules, suggesting a decrease in adhesion-dependent chemoresistance and, on the other hand, an increase in metastatic potential of the cells. These results lead to a conclusion that modulation of IL-1 receptor activity could have applications as a part of combination therapy for advanced and highly metastatic colorectal cancers.

AB The exact role of inflammatory immune response in bone healing process is still unclear, but the success of the alveolar bone healing process seems to be associated with a moderate and transitory inflammatory response, while insufficient or exacerbated responses seems to have a detrimental influence in the healing outcome. In this context, we performed a comparative analysis of mice strains genetically selected for maximum (AIRmax) or minimum (AIRmin) acute inflammatory response to address the influence of inflammation genes in alveolar bone healing outcome. Experimental groups comprised 8-week-old male or female AIRmax and AIRmin submitted to extraction of upper right incisor, and evaluated at 0, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after upper incision extraction by micro-computed tomography (mu CT), histomorphometry, birefringence, immunohistochemistry and molecular (PCRArray) analysis. Overall, the results demonstrate a similar successful bone healing outcome at the endpoint was evidenced in both AIRmin and AIRmax strains. The histormophometric analysis reveal a slight but significant decrease in blood clot and inflammatory cells density, as well a delay in the bone formation in AIRmax strain in the early times, associated with a decreased expression of BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, TGFb1, RUNX2, and ALP. The evaluation of inflammatory cells nature reveals increased GR1 + cells counts in AIRmax strain at 3d, associated with increased levels of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL1 and CXCL2, and its receptor CXCR1, while F4/80 + cell prevails in AIRmin strain at 7d. Also, our results demonstrate a relative predominance of M2 macrophages in AIRmin strain, associated with an increased expression of ARG1, IL10, TGFb, while Ml macrophages prevail in AIRmax, which parallel with increased IL-1B, IL-6 and TNF expression. At late repair stage, AIRmax presents evidences of increased bone remodeling, characterized by increased density of blood vessels and osteoclasts in parallel with decreased bone matrix density, as well increased levels of MMPs, osteoclastogenic and osteocyte markers. In the view of contrasting inflammatory and healing phenotypes of AIRmin and AIRmax strains in other models, the unpredicted phenotype observed suggests the existence of specific QTLs (Quantitative trait loci) responsible for the regulation 'sterile' inflammation and bone healing events. Despite the similar endpoint healing, AIRmax strain delayed repair was associated with increased presence of neutrophils and Ml1 macrophages, supporting the association of M2 cells with faster bone healing. Further studies are required to clarify the elements responsible for the regulation of inflammatory events at bone healing sites, as well the determinants of bone healing outcome.

TI High expression of S100 calgranulin genes in peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells from patients with Takayasu arteritis
SO CYTOKINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Takayasu arteritis; S100A12; TLR4; Calgranulins
AB Background: Toll-like receptors (TLR) 1 to 4 are highly expressed in aorta. Activation of TLR4 causes transmural arteritis in Human temporal artery-SCID chimera model. Neither TLR-4 nor its ligands have been studied in TA patients as yet. Aim of this study was to examine the expression of TLR4 and its endogenous ligands in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA).
   Methods: mRNA expression of TLR4, RAGE and various endogenous TLR4 ligands were quantified in PBMCs of 24 TA patients and 19 sex and age matched healthy controls by real time PCR using specific primers and SYBR Green qPCR master mix. S100A8/A9 and S100A12 were measured in cell culture supernatant of PBMCs from TA patients and healthy controls, both in un-stimulated state as well as, after lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulated cultures for 4 h. Expression of S100A8/A9 in aortic tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry.
   Results: The mRNA expression of S100A8, S100A9, S100A12 and TLR4 were higher, while expression of RAGE and HSP70 were lower in TA as compared to healthy controls. Induction with LPS led to increase in secretion of both S100A8/A9 and S100A12 levels in TA as well as healthy controls. The fold of induction, measured by LPS stimulated/unstimulated control was higher in healthy controls [2.88 (1.7-3.53) fold] as compared to TA [1.345 (1-1.82) fold]; p < 0.05. Numerically, S100A8/A9 was also higher in healthy controls [2.04 (1.7-5.6) fold] as compared to TA [1.38 (1.09-3.6) fold], but it didn't reach statistical significance; p = 0.129. Mild to moderate intensity expression of S100A8/A9 protein was noted in aortic tissues from patients with TA.
   Conclusion: mRNA expression of TLR4 and its ligand S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 in PBMCs of TA patients was higher as compared to healthy controls. LPS stimulation led to higher induction of S100A12 secretion in healthy controls as compared to TA. Expression of S100A8/A9 was detected in inflamed aortic tissues from patients with TA.

AB Objective: Cytokine dysregulation contributes to inflammation and organ damage in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) can determine which groups of cytokines have the most influence across disease activity states.
   Material and Method: A cross-sectional study of age- and gender-matched SLE patients (n = 100) and controls (n = 31). SLE patients had a median Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index - 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score of 6 (IQR 2, 11). IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, BAFF, TNF-alpha, TGF-1 beta, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta and MCP-1 levels were quantified by sandwich ELISA, and compared non-parametrically between groups. PCA was used to determine the principal components across controls, SLE patients in states of remission (SLEDAI-2K = 0), low disease activity (LDA = SLEDAI-2K from 1 <= x <= 4) or high disease activity (HDA = SLEDAI-2K > 4).
   Results: TGF-beta 1 (Rs = 0.266, p = 0.005) and IL-1 beta (Rs -0.199, p = 0.004) inversely correlated, whereas BAFF correlated with increasing disease activity (Rs 0.465, p < 0.001).
   IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, and TNF-alpha were featured consistently in the PC1 of all study groups. PC1 changes from controls to SLE-HDA patients, included: the increased impact of IL-1 beta (from 0.58 to > 0.95); increased impact of IL-6 in HDA (0.76); increased influence of MIP-1 alpha (0.60) and MIP-1 beta (0.85); and the uncoupling of TGF-131 (0.14). PC2 changes from healthy controls to the HDA state, included: the increased influence of BAFF (from -0.18 to 0.88); the oppositional effect of TGF-beta 1 ( 0.36); and, the inclusion of MCP-1 (0.65).
   Levels of cytokine profiles were equivalent between controls and SLE patients (p > 0.18). BAFF was not associated with the cytokine profiles. TGF-beta 1 associated with Thl (Rs 0.36), Th1 + Th17 (Rs 0.22), and inversely with Th17/Th2 (Rs 0.23) profiles. IL-ill associated with the proinflammatory (Rs 0.47), Thl (Rs 0.55), Th2 (Rs 0.55), Th17 (Rs 0.51), Th1 + Th17 (Rs 0.56), Th2 + Treg (Rs 0.45), and inversely with the (Th1 + Th17 / Th2 + Treg) (Rs -0.22) and Th17/Th2 (Rs -0.27) profiles (all, p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Principal component analysis helped to describe the influence of complex cytokine interactions in SLE in a manner congruent with the wider literature. The typical univariate changes in BAFF and TGF-beta 1 levels with increasing levels of disease activity, were not the dominant factors (in PC1) in the PCA. The PCA demonstrated that IL-1 beta did not seem to change its regulatory function in SLE.

AB Different cardiovascular risk factors present a heterogenic manifestation of lower limb atherosclerosis. The molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. We aimed to clarify this phenomenon by studying the association of major cardiovascular risk factors with the profile of serum cytokines in 226 consecutive patients with lower limb atherosclerosis treated at a department of Vascular Surgery during a one-year enrollment period. Increasing age independently associated with higher levels of IFN-gamma inducible factors MIG, CTACK and IP-10 (P < 0.001 for all). Patients with chronic kidney disease had higher serum levels of MIF, IL-16 and SCF (P = 0.001 or less for all). Smoking and hypertension associated with IL-17 (P = 0.037 and 0.015, respectively). In addition, smoking associated with growth factors known to induce myeloid progenitor cell proliferation: GM-CSF (P = 0.035), PDGF (P = 0.024), bFGF (P = 0.026), and HGF (P = 0.030). Dyslipidemia also associated with myeloproliferative factors: MIB-1 alpha (P = 0.005) and PDGF (P = 0.01). Type II diabetes associated with Th2 mediated inflammation: IL-5 (P < 0.001), IL-7 (P = 0.004) and IL-13 (P = 0.015). Major cardiovascular risk factors are associated with different circulating cytokines implicating different immunological pathology.

AB Aim: In the currently available literature there are no works investigating the correlation between CCR5-Delta 32 polymorphism and dyslipidemia in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Therefore, we have decided to explore the potential role played by this polymorphic locus in the incidence of dyslipidemia as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with T1D.
   Methods: A total of 380 patients with T1D were selected. Patients were divided into two groups: 180 patients with diabetic dyslipidemia and 200 controls without dyslipidemia. Characterization of CCR5-Delta 32 genotypes was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression model was used to examine the association between CCR5-Delta 32 polymorphism and dyslipidemia.
   Results: When participants were analyzed according to CCR5-Delta 32 polymorphism, Delta 32 carriers presented higher levels of: HbA1c (p < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (p < 0.001), LDL (p = 0.02) as well as TG (p = 0.01) and lower levels of HDL (p = 0.01) than noncarriers. Moreover, the minor allele Delta 32 was more frequent in dyslipidemic subjects than controls (p < 0.001) and conferred an increased individual risk for dyslipidemia (OR = 2.327; 95% CI = 11.241-4.365; p = 0.009).
   Conclusions: The findings of our study suggest that the CCR5-Delta 32 polymorphism is associated with elevated plasma lipid levels and the Delta 32 allele increases the risk of dyslipidemia in patients with T1D. Identification of the functional variant underlying these associations may potentially lead to the development of a novel and adjunctive approach for the treatment of dyslipidemia and CVD.

AB Poly cystic ovary syndrome is the major cause of anovulatory infertility. TNF alpha, pro-inflammatory cytokine is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, therefore in present study we tried to find the association between TNF alpha promoter polymorphisms, TNF alpha levels and the risk of PCOS. Present case control study was carried on 400 women of age 16-40 years. TNF alpha levels were measured by ELISA whereas promoter polymorphisms were evaluated by PCR-RFLP. Haplotype and Linkage disequilibrium analysis was also done. TNF alpha level was significantly higher in PCOS group (13.24 +/- 9.78) than control (5.5 +/- 3.8). Haplotype analysis revealed that GGTCT, AGTCT, AGCCT and AACCT are the susceptible haplotypes associated with TNF alpha level. rs361525 and rsl 799964 were found to be associated with the risk of PCOS (p = 0.0006, 0.015). GGCCT, AATAT, GATAT (most susceptible), AGCCT, GGTCT and GATCT are the susceptible haplotypes for PCOS. Significant difference between TNF alpha levels in PCOS and Control group suggest its one of the promising candidates for the marker of inflammation (sensitivity and specificity 91.23 and 94.56% respectively, with area under the curve 0.907 at 95% CI 0.8723-0.9512). Presence of GGCCT haplotype suggests the susceptibility towards PCOS which needs to be further verified. In addition to this, present study not only provides a pavement for the diagnosis, but also monitoring and management of PCOS too.

AB Whole body irradiation causes significant apoptosis in various tissues such as the thymus. If apoptotic cells outnumber the phagocytic capacity of macrophages, apoptosis becomes secondary necrosis, inducing inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages. Radiation also induces thymic lymphomas in C57BL/6 mice after four consecutive irradiations with 1.6 Gy X-rays with nearly 100% incidence. Since cancer development is modulated by a microenvironment involving macrophages, we examined the kinetics of thymocyte number and plastic adherent cell number in the thymus as well as cytokine mRNA expression by plastic adherent cells in the thymus after split-dose irradiation. Upon split-dose irradiation, thymocyte number changed dramatically, whereas plastic adherent cell number did not. Among cytokine mRNAs tested, IL-1 beta, IL-11 and IL-12p40 mRNAs were up regulated 2 days after the 1st and 2nd, 3rd and 4th, and 2nd and 3rd irradiations, respectively. On the other hand, TNF-alpha mRNA was up regulated 2 days after the 3rd irradiation and 2 weeks after the 4th irradiation. The level of IL-11 protein was also increased 2 days after 3rd and 4th irradiations. These results suggest that, upon split-dose irradiation, macrophages in the thymus produce various cytokines in a time-dependent manner, thereby contributing to induction of thymic lymphomas.

AB The extracellular sulfatases (Sulfs), sulfatase 1 (Sulf1) and sulfatase 2 (Sulf2), have an important role in cell signaling by modulating the 6-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface. Gene expression and enzyme activity of Sulfs are elevated in hypertensive vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) compared to those in normotensive VSMCs. CXC-chemokine ligand (CXCL) 8 has a pathogenic role in the development and progression of hypertension. In this study, we investigated the effect of Sulfs on the expression of CXCL8-induced endothelin (ET)-1, a hypertensive mediator, in VSMCs from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Expression of ET-1 and elevation of angiotensin (Ang) II-induced ET-1 expression by CXCL8 were reduced in Sulf2 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected SHR VSMCs. But, downregulation of Sulfl did not affect the expression of CXCL8-induced ET-1 and additive effect of CXCL8 on Ang II-induced ET-1 expression in SHR VSMCs. CXCL8-induced ET-1 expression and the additive effect of CXCL8 on Ang II-induced ET-1 expression were dependent on the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1) R) pathway, not the Ang II type 2 receptor (AT(2) R) pathway. In addition, downregulation of Sulf2 reduced the expression of CXCL8-induced AT, R and abrogated the additive effect of CXCL8 on Ang II-induced AT(1) R expression in SHR VSMCs. Sulf2 mediated, partially, the expression of ET-1 and the additive expression of Ang II-induced ET-1 mRNA by CXCL8 via the AT(1) R pathway in SHR VSMCs. These findings suggest that Sulf2 is an up-regulatory factor in the additive action of CXCL8 via the AT(1) R pathway on Ang II-induced ET-1 expression in VSMCs under hypertension environment.

AB Virus infection induces type I interferons (IFNs) that in turn exert their pleiotropic effects through inducing a large number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The IFN-induced 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) have been identified as a member of the ISGs family characterized by the ability to synthesize 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A), which can induce the degradation of viral RNA by activating RNase L within the infected cells to block viral replications. In this study, we characterized the OASs of the Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis), a small mammal genetically close to primates and has the potential as animal model for viral infections. We identified 4 putative tree shrew OASs (tOASs, including tOAS1, tOAS2, tOASL1, and tOASL2) and characterized their roles in antiviral responses. Tree shrew lost tOAS3 that was presented in human and mouse. Phylogenetic analyses based on the protein sequences showed a close relationship of tOASs with those of mammals. Constitutive mRNA expression of tOASs was found in seven tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, small intestine and brain). Moreover, tOASs were significantly up-regulated upon various virus infections. Overexpression of tOASs significantly inhibited DNA virus and RNA virus replications in tree shrew primary renal cells. tOAS1 and tOAS2, but not tOASL1 and tOASL2, exerted their anti-HSV activity in an RNase L dependent pathway. Collectively, our results revealed the evolutionary conservation of tOASs in tree shrew and might offer helpful information for creating viral infection models using the Chinese tree shrew.

AB Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototype of systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by loss of immune tolerance against self-antigens where autoantibody production is the hallmark of disease. B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) and A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are cytokines that promote auto reactive cell survival, immunoglobulin-class switching and autoantibody responses in human and mouse SLE models. BAFF and APRIL exert their functions through interactions with their receptors BAFF-R and TACI that are differentially expressed in B lymphocyte subsets, monocytes, dendritic cells and T lymphocytes. BAFF stimulation favors T lymphocyte activation and cytokine production through BAFF-R, which could contribute to the Th1, Th17 and/or Th2 response dysregulation observed in SLE patients.
   Objective: To evaluate the expression of the cytokines BAFF and APRIL and their association with the receptors BAFF-R and TACI on CD3 + T cells and to evaluate Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profile in patients with SLE.
   Methods: Fifteen healthy controls (HC) and 36 SLE patients were included, and their demographic and clinical data were assessed. The disease activity index (Mex-SLEDAI) and damage index (SLICC) were applied to the SLE patients. BAFF-R and TACT expression on CD3 + T cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. Serum BAFF and APRIL concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Cytokine levels of Thl (IL-12, IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha), Th2 (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13) and Th17 (IL-1 beta e IL-17) were quantified with a multiplex assay (MAGPIX). Statistical analysis was performed using PASW Statistics v.20 and GraphPad Prism v.6 software.
   Results: No differences in BAFF-R or TACI expression on the CD3 + T cells of SLE and HC were observed. BAFF-R expression correlates inversely with disease activity (r = -0.538, p < 0.01), while TACI correlates with disease activity (r = 0.530, p < 0.05). Serum BAFF and APRIL levels were high in SLE patients and correlated with the disease activity index Mex-SLEDAI (r = 0.621, p < 0.01 and r = 0.416, p < 0.05). SLE patients were found to have significantly higher levels of IL-12, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1 beta, IL-1 beta and IL-17 compared to HC (p < 0.05). Cytokines IL-17 (r = 0.526) and TNF-alpha (r = 0.410) correlate with disease activity (p < 0.05), while APRIL (r = 0.477), IL-10 (r = 0.426) and IFN-gamma (r = 0.440) levels were associated with organ damage (p < 0.01). Serum BAFF expression levels correlate with 1L-4 (r = 0.424; p < 0.05), IL-6 (r = 0.420; p < 0.05) and IL-10 (r = 0.459; p < 0.01), whereas APRIL levels correlate with IL-2 (r = 0.666; p < 0.01), IL-12 (r = 0.611; p < 0.01) and TNF-alpha (r = 0.471; p < 0.05) cytokines. A subgroup of SLE patients with high serum BAFF levels ( > 2 ng/mL) also showed increased APRIL, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10 levels (p < 0.05). Finally, BAFF, IL-4 and TNF-alpha serum levels were associated with high titers of antinuclear antibodies.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates an imbalance in the Th1/Th2 cytokine profile, with increased proinflammatory cytokines, as well as BAFF and APRIL serum levels. Associations of BAFF with Th2 profile cytokines and disease activity, as well as APRIL with Thl profile cytokines and organ damage, suggest that BAFF and APRIL generated in the autoimmunity context could through still unknown mechanisms, modulate the micro environment, and perpetuate the inflammatory response, autoantibody production and organ damage observed in SLE patients.

AB In sepsis, greater understanding of the inflammatory mechanism involved would provide insights into the condition and into its extension to the muscular apparatus in critically ill patients. Therefore, this study evaluates the inflammatory profile of pneumosepsis induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.p.) in lungs and skeletal muscles during the first 72 h. Male BALB/c mice were divided into 4 groups, submitted to intratracheal inoculation of K.p. at a concentration of 2 x 10(8) (PS) or PBS, and assessed after 24 (PS24), 48 (PS48) and 72 (PS72) hours. The Maximum Physical Capacity Test (MPCT) was performed before and after induction. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed by total cell number, nitric oxide levels (NOx), IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); inflammation and muscle trophism were evaluated by the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, TGF-1 beta and BDNF by ELISA and NF-kappa B by western blotting in muscle tissue. Cells and colony forming units (CFU) were also analyzed in blood samples. The PS groups showed an increase in total cells in the BALF (p < 0.05), as well in the number of granulocytes in the blood (p < 0.05) and a decrease in performance in the MPCT (p < 0.05). NOx levels showed significant increase in PS72, when compared to Control group (p = 0.03). The PS24 showed a significant increase lung in TNF-alpha levels (p < 0.001) and in CFU (p = 0.013). We observed an increase in muscular IL-6 and nuclear NF-kappa B levels in PS24 group, when compared to PS48 and Control groups (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, mild signs of injury in the skeletal muscle tissue does not support the idea of an early muscular injury in this experimental model, suggesting that the low performance of the animals during the MPCT may be related to lung inflammation.

AB Epithelial alpha v beta 6 integrin participates in immune surveillance in many organs, including the gastrointestinal track. Expression of alpha v beta 6 integrin is reduced in the junctional epithelium of the gingiva in periodontal diseases, and mutations in the ITGB6 gene are associated with these diseases in humans and mice. The aim of this study was to unravel potential differences in the inflammatory responses in the periodontal tissues of FVB wild-type (WT) and beta 6 integrin-null (Itgb6(-/-)) mice, using a ligature-induced periodontitis model and assessing inflammation, bone loss and expression profiles of 34 genes associated with periodontal disease. Using micro-CT and histology, we demonstrated more advanced inflammation and bone loss in the control and ligatured Itgb6(-/-) mice compared to the WT animals. Neutrophil and macrophage marker genes were significantly upregulated by ligation in both WT and Itgb6(-/-) mice while the expression of T-cell and B-cell markers was downregulated, suggesting acute-type of inflammation. Expression of inflammasome NLRP3-related genes Nlpr3 and Illb was also significantly increased in both groups. However, the expression of 1118 was significantly lower in non ligatured Itgb6(-/-) mice than in the WT mice and was further downregulated in both groups by the ligatures. IL 18 mediates many effects of the AIM2 inflammasome, including regulation of the microbiome. Interestingly, expression of Aim2 was significantly lower in both control and ligatured Itgb6(-/-) mice than in WT animals. Overall, ligature-induced periodontitis was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and osteoclastogenic regulatory molecules. Another significant difference between the Itgb6(-/-) and WT mice was that mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased in ligatured WT mice but reduced in the Itgb6(-/-) mice. In conclusion, alpha v beta 6 integrin in junctional epithelium of the gingiva appears to positively regulate the expression of the AIM2 inflammasome and anti-inflammatory IL-10, thus providing protection against periodontal inflammation.

AB Background/Objective: To study the concentrations of preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) -an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation, implicated in adipose tissue metabolism, late metabolic disorders and fetal growth-in maternal and umbilical cord serum, as well as maternal milk and correlate above concentrations with intrauterine growth and other perinatal parameters.
   Material and methods: Pref-1 concentrations were determined by ELISA in antepartum maternal and umbilical cord serum, as well as day 3 to 4 postpartum breast milk, deriving from 80 women, who delivered 40 appropriate (AGA), 20 large for gestational age (LGA) and 20 intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) neonates, classified by the use of customized birth-weight standards adjusted for significant determinants of fetal growth.
   Results: Umbilical cord serum Pref-1 concentrations were significantly higher than antepartum maternal ones (p < 0.001), while breast milk concentrations were the lowest (p < 0.001 concerning umbilical serum, p < 0.001 concerning maternal serum). Umbilical cord serum Pref-1 concentrations were significantly lower in the LGA group than in the AGA one (p = 0.044). Breast milk and maternal serum Pref-1 concentrations did not differ between the three intrauterine growth groups. Maternal serum and breast milk Pref-1 concentrations did not correlate with maternal age, body mass index before and after gestation, birth weight, body length, and customized centile. A positive weak correlation was recorded between maternal serum and milk Pref-1 concentrations (r = 0.238, p = 0.034).
   Conclusions: Pref-1 concentrations in umbilical cord serum are higher than in antepartum maternal serum, probably pointing to its fetal origin and role in intrauterine growth. Breast milk concentrations, being extremely low, and possibly implying infant protection from metabolic disorders, positively correlate with maternal serum ones, conceivably suggesting a transfer of the substance from the circulation to the breast. Umbilical cord serum Pref-1 concentrations were lower in LGA fetuses/neonates, as compared to respective AGA ones.

   OBSTETRICS; IMPLANT; HISTORY; RISK
AB Postpartum contraceptive decision making is complex, and recommendations may be influenced by breastfeeding intentions. While biologically plausible, concerns about the adverse impact of hormonal contraception on breast milk production have not been supported by the clinical evidence to date. However, the data have limitations, which can lead providers with different priorities around contraception and breastfeeding to interpret the data in a way that advances their personal priorities. Discrepancies in interpretations can lead to divergent recommendations for individual women and may cause conflict. Furthermore, providers must recognize that decision making about contraception and breastfeeding takes place in complex cultural, historical and socioeconomic contexts. Implicit bias may influence a provider's counseling. Unrecognized biases toward one patient or another, or one practice or another, may influence a provider's counseling. It is crucial for providers to strive to recognize their own biases. Providers need to respectfully recognize each patient's values and preferences regarding hormonal contraception and breastfeeding. Developing a patient-centered decision tool or implementing patient-centered interview techniques specifically around breastfeeding and contraception could help to minimize provider-driven variability in care.

AB Objective: To describe the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of medical abortion in the late first trimester.
   Study design: We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for articles in any language that examined the success of medical abortion at gestational ages (>63 to84 days gestation). We sought articles that compared: medical abortion with surgical abortion at this gestational age, combination mifepristone and misoprostol and/or misoprostol alone); different dosages of misoprostol; different routes of misoprostol administration; frequency of dosing; and location of medical abortion (in health care facility vs. outpatient management). Our primary outcome was complete abortion. Data was independently abstracted by two authors, graded for evidence quality, and assessed for risk of bias.
   Results: The search strategy returned 3384 articles, nine of which met inclusion criteria. Medical abortion, as compared with surgical abortion, was effective in the late first trimester (94.6% versus 97.9% complete abortion). A combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol was significantly more effective than misoprostol alone (90.4 versus 81.6% complete abortion). Complete abortion rates for all regimens investigated ranged from 78.6% to 94.6%. Success rates were higher with repeat dosing of misoprostol both in combination regimens and alone, and with vaginal compared with oral administration for repeat dosing.
   Conclusion: A limited body of evidence indicates a range of efficacy of medical abortion in the late first trimester and highlights the need for well-designed trials in this gestational age range. Implications: This review highlights the need for research focused on the late first trimester to strengthen the body of evidence. The available evidence is limited but offers reassurance that adverse events are rare for later first trimester abortion. Importantly, new research demonstrates that efficacy remains unchanged in the 10th gestational week regardless of whether the medication is taken in a facility or at a woman's home.

AB Objective: This study assessed whether immediate postpartum insertion of levonorgestrel contraceptive implants is associated with a difference in infant growth from birth to 6 months, onset of lactogenesis, or breastfeeding continuation at 3 and 6 months postpartum compared to delayed insertion at 6 to 8 weeks postpartum.
   Study design: We conducted a randomized trial of women in Uganda who desired contraceptive implants postpartum. We randomly assigned participants to receive either immediate (within 5 days of delivery) or delayed (6 to 8 weeks postpartum) insertion of a two-rod levonorgestrel contraceptive implant system. This is a prespecified secondary analysis evaluating breastfeeding outcomes. The primary outcome of this secondary analysis was change in infant weight; infants were weighed and measured at birth and 6 months. We used a validated questionnaire to assess onset of lactogenesis daily in person while participants were in the hospital, and then daily by phone after they left the hospital, until lactogenesis was documented. We used interviewer-administered questionnaires to assess breastfeeding continuation and concerns at 3 months and 6 months postpartum.
   Results: Among the 96 women randomized to the immediate group and the 87 women to the delayed group, the mean change in infant weight from birth to 6 months was similar between groups: 4632 g in the immediate group and 4407 g in the delayed group (p=.26). Among the 97 women who had not experienced lactogenesis prior to randomization, the median time to onset of lactogenesis did not differ significantly between the immediate and delayed groups (65 h versus 63 h; p=.84). Similar proportions of women in the immediate and delayed groups reported exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months (74% versus 71%; p=.74) and 6 months (48% versus 52%; p=.58).
   Conclusion: We found no association between the timing of postpartum initiation of levonorgestrel contraceptive implants and change in infant growth from birth to 6 months, onset of lactogenesis, or breastfeeding continuation at 3 or 6 months postpartum. Implications: This study provides evidence that immediate postpartum initiation of contraception implants does not have a deleterious effect on infant growth or initiation or continuation of breastfeeding.

ID CESAREAN DELIVERY; DELAYED INSERTION; IUD INSERTION
AB Objective: To determine the association between provider training level and postplacental intrauterine device (IUD) outcomes following insertion instruction by email only.
   Study design: We conducted a single-center chart review of demographics, insertion and clinical outcomes within 6 months of delivery for 116 patients who underwent postplacental levonorgestrel 52 mg IUD placement from October 1, 2016, to March 31, 2017.
   Results: We confirmed IUD retention, removal or expulsion in 87 of 116 (75.0%) patients by 6 months after delivery. Complete expulsion or removal for malposition occurred in 20 (23.0%) patients and more frequently after vaginal than cesarean delivery (30.2% vs. 4.2%, OR 9.93 [95% CI 1.25-78.96]) and when a postgraduate year (PGY) 1 physician placed the IUD compared to a PGY 2-4 or attending physician (37.5% vs. 14.5%, OR 3.52 [95% CI 1.25-9.94]).
   Conclusion: Postplacental levonorgestrel 52 mg IUD expulsion rates are associated with provider training level as well as delivery route, though the individual association of each of these factors is difficult to ascertain given the high degree of collinearity between these two variables in our study.

AB Objectives: To identify barriers to postpartum permanent contraception procedures after vaginal delivery and to explore contraceptive and reproductive outcomes of women who experience unfulfilled requests. Study design: We performed a retrospective cohort study of women requesting postpartum permanent contraception after vaginal delivery from 7/1/11 to 6/30/14 at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, NY. We ascertained patient characteristics and outcomes through electronic medical records and birth certificate data search.
   Results: Of 189 women in our sample, 78 (413%) had a postpartum permanent contraception procedure. Factors associated with unfulfilled requests in adjusted analysis included BMI >=.40 (OR 3.71, 95% CI 1.46-9.48 compared to BMI <35), federal sterilization consent signed >= 36 weeks (OR 5.10, 95% CI 1.64-15.86 compared to <36 weeks) and delivery in the latter half of the week (Wednesday -Saturday) (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.08-3.79). Documented reasons for unfulfilled permanent contraception requests included patient changing her mind related to procedural issues (21,18.9%), invalid consent (20,18.0%), maternal obesity (17,15.3%), lack of operating room availability (14, 12.6%) and ambivalence about permanent contraception (5, 4.5%). Of 57 women who planned for interval permanent contraception and had institutional follow-up over the subsequent year, 14 (24.6%) had a procedure, 8 (14.0%) initiated long -acting reversible contraception, and 13 (22.8%) became pregnant. Conclusions: Fewer than half of women obtained desired postpartum permanent contraception after vaginal delivery, with logistical issues and obesity being the most common reported barriers. Health care providers should advocate for access to postpartum permanent contraception, as well as discuss prenatally the individualized probability of nonfulfillment and importance of alternative contraceptive plans.
   Implications: Logistical barriers and inappropriate antenatal preparation contribute to the fact that over half of women do not obtain desired postpartum permanent contraception after vaginal delivery. To respect reproductive autonomy and improve care, clinicians and other health officials should eliminate barriers to immediate postpartum permanent contraception while increasing access to alternative options.

AB Objective: In this study we aimed to investigate the content and process of contraceptive counseling surrounding combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) methods (combined oral contraceptives, the ring, and the patch). Study design: We performed a mixed methods analysis of data collected as part of the Patient -Provider Communication about Contraception study, in which reproductive age women and their providers were recruited at several San Francisco Bay Area clinics from 2009-2012. Participants completed pre- and post -visit surveys, and had their visits audio recorded and transcribed. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses of the entire cohort to examine associations between demographic characteristics and pre-existing method preferences with method selection and counseling content, and coded transcripts of a subset of the sample for salient themes related to content and process of counseling about combined hormonal contraceptive methods using a directed content analysis approach.
   Results: The overall sample included 342 women, with 152 women (44%) having a preference for a specific CHC prior to their visit, 127 women (37%) had a preference for a non-CHC method, and 63 (18%) having no existing method preference. Of the women who reported preferring a CHC in their pre -visit survey, the majority (72%) chose that method. We found that women were inconsistently counseled about the range of CHC methods. For example, women who had no pre -visit method preference (52%) or who preferred the ring (54%) or the patch (73%) were more likely to receive comprehensive counseling about the three CHC methods than were women who preferred combined oral contraceptives (35%) or non-CHC methods (33%). Providers mentioned the patch the least often, and in qualitative analysis indicated discomfort with prescribing this method. Side effects and benefits of methods, as well as strategies to enhance successful use of the chosen method, were inconsistently discussed. In only 73% of visits in which a woman chose a CHC did the provider assess the patient's ability to use the chosen method correctly, and in 66% of all visits in which women chose a CHC method, providers discussed what to do if she was dissatisfied with the method.
   Conclusions: Counseling about combined hormonal contraceptive methods often does not include information about all available methods, or comprehensive information about side effects, benefits, or logistics of use. As this counseling can impact patient's satisfaction with and continuation of their chosen method of contraception, future work should focus on designing interventions to improve providers' ability to meet patients' needs. Implications: Short acting hormonal contraception is widely used, but counseling for these methods often neglects key features. Comprehensive counseling about all methods and their individual features can improve contraceptive selection and use. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: While some attention has been paid to men's contraceptive use and attitudes in international contexts, relatively little is known about the attitudes towards contraception and pregnancy of low-income, urban men in the U.S.
   Study design: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 58 low-income men in Pittsburgh, PA, to explore their perspectives on contraception, pregnancy, fatherhood, and relationships. We analyzed the interviews using a combination of content analysis, the constant comparison method, and thematic analysis.
   Results: Men who we interviewed frequently described feeling that they lacked agency regarding when pregnancies occurred and whether or not they became fathers. Several factors contributed to their sense of low agency, including the belief that women should control contraception and reproduction, a reluctance to have conversations about contraception in some contexts, a lack of acceptable male-controlled contraceptive methods, experiences with pregnancy-promoting behaviors by women, and fatalistic attitudes towards pregnancy occurrence.
   Conclusions: Many men in our study described perceptions of limited reproductive agency. In describing their lack of agency, men reinforced contemporary gender norms in which the "work" of pregnancy prevention is a woman's responsibility. Responses to men's perceived limited reproductive agency should work towards deconstructing gendered norms in the work of pregnancy prevention and promote shared and mutual gender responsibility over reproduction while also supporting women's reproductive autonomy. Implications: This study identifies several factors that contribute to low-income men's sense of low reproductive agency and highlights the complexity of acknowledging men's feelings and perceptions about reproductive control in the broader context of gender and power.

AB Objective: The objective was to assess women's personal interest in and support for three alternative models of medication abortion (MA) provision.
   Study design: Using an online survey of a U.S. national, probability-based representative sample of women ages 18-49, we gauged personal interest in and general support for three alternative models for accessing abortion pills: (1) in advance from a doctor for future use, (2) over-the-counter (OTC) from a drugstore and (3) online without a prescription. We conducted multivariable analyses to identify characteristics associated with support for these provision models.
   Results: Fifty percent (n=7022) of eligible women invited completed the survey. Nearly half (49%) supported and 30% were personally interested in one or more of the three access models; 44% supported advance provision, 37% supported OTC access, and 29% supported online access. Common advantages reported for advance provision, OTC and online access included privacy (49%, 29% and 46%, respectively), convenience (38%, 44% and 38%) and being able to end the pregnancy earlier (48%, 40% and 29%). Common disadvantages included concern that women might take the pills incorrectly (55%, 53% and 57%), not seeing a clinician before the abortion (52%, 54% and 53%) and safety (42%, 43% and 60%). History of abortion and experiencing barriers accessing reproductive health services were associated with greater support for the alternative models.
   Conclusion: Women are interested in and support alternative models of MA provision, in particular, advance provision. However, they also reported concerns about incorrect pill use and not seeing a clinician beforehand. Implications: Offering women more choices in how they access medication abortion, including options where they can safely self-manage their own care, has the potential to expand access to care.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effect of investigational vaginal rings containing nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) plus 17pestradiol (E2) or etonogestrel (ENG) plus E2 in women with moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea.
   Study design: This was a Phase 2b randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind study. We randomized participants to one of five treatment groups: four hormonal rings and one placebo ring. The investigational vaginal rings released 300 pg of E2 daily along with 700 pg or 900 pg of NOMAC or 100 lig or 125 pg of ENG. Each participant received 2 identical rings and was to insert each for 21 days followed by a 7-day ring-free period. The primary endpoint, as assessed by a daily electronic diary (e-Diary), was the change in menstrual pain score from baseline to the second in-treatment withdrawal bleeding episode (Cycle 2). The pain score was the mean of the three highest scores for menstrual cramping pain (0-4 point scale) recorded from the day before menses to the third day of bleeding. The primary hypothesis was that at least one investigational vaginal ring would demonstrate a statistically significant larger reduction from baseline in pain score compared to placebo. Secondary endpoints included total mean impact score (which assessed the negative impact on work/school, physical activities, leisure/social activities) and the amount and days of rescue medication (ibuprofen) used. Clinical trial registration number: NCT01670656.
   Results: We randomized 439 participants. The mean pain score decreased from baseline to Cycle 2 in all groups; the decrease in all four treatment groups compared to placebo was statistically significant (p-values 0.002). All treatment groups had greater reductions than placebo in ibuprofen intake and greater improvement in impact scores; these differences were statistically significant for both endpoints for the ENG-E2 100/300 pg/day group, while the other groups were not statistically significant for one or both endpoints.
   Conclusion: All four investigational rings produced a statistically significantly larger reduction from baseline in mean menstrual pain score compared to placebo while pain medication use decreased. Implications: This placebo-controlled study provides evidence that vaginal contraceptive rings containing NOMACE2 or ENG-E2 improve moderate to severe dysmenorrhea, across all of doses studied. This adds to the evidence that hormonal contraceptives are effective treatments for dysmenorrhea. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Reporting sterilization as a current contraceptive method among
   sterilized women: Check for lessons learned from a population with high
   sterilization rates, Rajasthan, India
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Sterilization; Survey; Data quality; Contraceptive prevalence rate
AB Objective: Measuring current use of contraception relies on self-reported responses from survey respondents. Reporting validity may be affected by women's interpretation of the question and may vary by background characteristics of women. The study aims to understand levels and patterns of underreporting of female sterilization in a population with high sterilization rates.
   Study design: Data came from the Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 survey conducted in Rajasthan, India, in early 2017. In addition to a conventional question to ascertain current contraceptive use, the survey included a probing question; women who did not report sterilization as a current method were asked if they were ever sterilized. Women were defined as sterilization users based on either question. Among sterilized women, we estimated the percent who reported sterilization as a current method. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess differential reporting across background characteristics.
   Results: Among women who were ever sterilized, 78% reported currently using any contraceptive method(s), and 77% reported sterilization as the current method. Women in the lowest household wealth quintile or in general caste were less likely to report sterilization as a current method. Time since sterilization was not associated with correct reporting of sterilization.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates, in a population with high sterilization, that sterilization as a current contraceptive method would be substantially underestimated using conventional survey questions. It highlights the importance of context-specific questionnaire adaptation to measure and monitor contraceptive use and provides implications in measuring current use of contraception in populations with high rates of sterilization.
   Implications: The paper examined reporting of sterilization as a current method among sterilized women. Only 77% of sterilized women reported sterilization as a current contraceptive method. In a population with high sterilization, inclusion of a probe question in surveys is recommended to understand reporting quality and accurately measure contraceptive prevalence rates.

AB Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to compare the 12-month continuation rate for women who self-injected subcutaneous depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) with that for women receiving intramuscular depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM) from a provider. This research contributes to the broader goal of identifying solutions to support women to use contraception for their full desired duration.
   Study design: Participants were clients from 13 clinics in the Dakar and Thies regions of Senegal who had decided to use injectable contraception prior to enrollment. They chose self-injection of DMPA-SC or provider administration of DMPA-IM. Self-injectors were trained and given three units of DMPA-SC. The provider-injected group received DMPA-IM and returned to the clinics for future injections. We interviewed participants at baseline and after the second, third and fourth injections (the equivalent of 12 months of contraceptive coverage). We employed Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate continuation probabilities, with a log-rank test to compare differences between groups. A multivariate Cox regression identified factors correlated with discontinuation.
   Results: The 12-month continuation rate for 650 women self-injecting DMPA-SC was 80.2%, while that for 649 women receiving DMPA-IM from a provider was 70.4% (p<.01). The difference in continuation between self injectors and those receiving DMPA from a provider remained significant in a multivariate Cox regression model. The primary reason for discontinuation in both groups (44.7% self-injected; 44.5% provider-injected) was forgetting to reinject or reinjecting late. Fewer women reported side effects in the self-injection group than in the provider-administered group.
   Conclusions: The higher 12-month continuation rate for women self-injecting DMPA-SC relative to provider administered DMPA-IM suggests that self-injection may help prevent pregnancy more consistently and continuously.
   Implications: Discontinuation of injectable contraception among women wishing to avoid pregnancy may increase unmet need in francophone West Africa. This study showed higher 12-month continuation rates for women who self-injected DMPA-SC, suggesting that this delivery method may improve injectable continuation. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB The bottom-up preparation and in-situ functionalization of MoS2 with poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA), was accomplished. For the realization of the PMAA-MoS2 hybrid material a facile yet fast protocol based on the thermal decomposition of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, as source for Mo and S, under microwave irradiation and in the presence of PMAA was employed. The PMAA-MoS2 was characterized by complementary spectroscopic, thermal and electron microscopy imaging techniques. Moreover, meaningful information about the dispersibility, the nature of the colloidal dispersion and the solution properties of the hybrid material were acquired by dynamic light scattering assays.

AB MoS2/reduce graphene oxide composites were synthesized using hydrothermal method by varying three different surfactants like Cetyltrimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB), Sodium Dodecyl Sulfonate (SDS) and TritonX-100 (TX-100). SEM images of the composites show different morphologies. The specific surface area and electrochemical performance are largely dependent on the morphologies of the composites. The MSG/CTAB composites exhibit the largest surface area (133 m(2).g(-1)) and the highest specific capacitance of 1022 F.g(-1) at a current density of 0.3 A.g(-1)among the studied composites. This composite is very promising for application in energy storage and other electrochemical devices.

AB Using the DFT calculations, we explore the possibility of using a porous Si-decorated carbon nitride fullerene (Si@C24N24) as a potential catalyst for reduction of N2O. Our results indicate that Si atom is stably anchored in the N-4 cavity of C24N24 with a large adsorption energy of - 6.85 eV. A N2O molecule can be easily dissociated into N-2 and O-ads species over the Si atom of Si@C24N24. The activation energy for the removing of O-ads by CO molecule is only 0.37 eV. Moreover, the reduction of N2O by CO can be selectively performed in the presence of H2O and O-2 molecules.

AB The fluorescence spectra of pyrene and Prodan in hexane-methylethylketone solutions, which are models of polyethylene degradation, were investigated to develop a method for understanding the degradation of polymer materials. The fluorescence properties of pyrene and Prodan were highly sensitive to the polarity of the solutions. The fluorescence intensity ratios, I-384/I-373 for pyrene and I-380/I-420 for Prodan, were useful indexes for investigating the local chemical environment. These fluorescence indexes may be more than 10 times sensitive to the conventional carbonyl index by infrared absorption. This fluorescence probe method will find further application in the evaluation of polymer degradation.

AB To investigate the formation mechanisms of CO2 clathrate hydrate under vacuum conditions, infrared spectra of vapor-deposited H2O-CO2 amorphous ice were measured. From analyses of variations in the spectral features with warming, remarkable changes were found at similar to 100 K. The results indicate that the deposited amorphous ice is transformed into CO2 clathrate hydrate at around similar to 100 K. From the results, a phase diagram of CO2 clathrate hydrate from vapor deposited amorphous ice was predicted. The results suggest the existence of pure CO2 clathrate hydrates in space.

AB The photodissociation dynamics of trimethylamine, N(CH3)(3), was studied using ion-imaging. The photolysis wavelength was scanned over the 200-236 nm region, where the S-1(3s) and S-2(3p) states were excited with varying relative populations. The dissociation threshold of C-N bond fission was found at 42,500 cm(-1), which is located between the S-1(3s) and S-2(3p) origins. The final-state distributions were qualitatively insensitive to the photoinitiated states, indicating a dissociation mechanism following ultrafast electronic dynamics. The CH3 photofragments showed dual ring-like scattering distributions, which were ascribed to branching to the CH3 + N(CH3)(2)((A) over tilde (2)A(1)) and CH3 + N(CH3)(2)((X) over tilde B-2(1)) pathways.

AB H-abstractions from CHF2-, -CH2- and -OH sites of 2, 2-difluoroethanol (CHF2CH2OH) molecule by Cl atom into the atmosphere are investigated to understand mechanism and kinetics by quantum calculations. Geometry optimization and frequency calculations are done at BHandHLYP/6-311 + + G(d,p) level of theory for all stationary points. Energies of all the species are further refined at CCSD(T) method along with same basis set. Our analysis suggests that the H-abstraction from -CH2- site is kinetically and thermodynamically more predominant than the other sites. The rate coefficients and branching ratios of the reactions and lifetime and global warming potential of the titled molecule are reported.

AB Photoabsorption spectra of isoflurane and sevoflurane have been measured with synchrotron radiation over the photon range 5.0-10.8 eV. Low-lying excited singlet valence and Rydberg states are investigated and the assignments supported by quantum chemical calculations, the latter also helping to identify the triplet states. This provides the first comprehensive investigation of all excited electronic states up to the first ionisation energy. The Rydberg series converging to the ionisation energy limits are identified according to the magnitude of the quantum defects. The measured absolute cross-sections have been used to calculate the photolysis lifetimes of isoflurane and sevoflurane in the Earth's atmosphere.

Molecular structures and vibrational properties of Palladium (II) complex were carried out using FT-IR, Raman. The optimized geometric structure and vibrational wavenumbers were examined using B3LYP with SDD basis set. The structural properties were determined using NMR techniques. Further, N-15 NMR spectrum was taken to determine the nitrogen atom to which the Pd atom was attached. Moreover, HOMO-LUMO levels, chemical hardness and electrophilicity were calculated. Experimental results were compared with theoretical results.

The as-synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The gas sensing properties of Fe2O3/WO3 composites, along with pure WO3 nanoplates and Fe2O3 NPs, were investigated to various volatile organic compounds. The nanohybrids based gas sensor showed a response of 105.8-100 ppm acetone at optimum operating temperature of 260 degrees C, whereas the pure WO3 nanoplates and Fe2O3 NPs based gas sensors showed responses of 31.0 and 6.6, respectively. The Fe2O3/WO3 sensor also showed high selectivity to acetone.

AB We introduce a novel calculation to the transmission coefficient of molecules with single impurity. The study employs tight binding Green's function method and new derived analytical formula to investigate chromene-like (even) and doped azulene-like (odd) model systems. Under certain circumstances, these specific even and odd models are respectively shown single and double critical points, at which the transmission becomes independent of the heteroatom position. Moreover, a counterintuitive correlation between the transmission and the coupling strength has analytically and numerically been approved: the transmission decreases with strengthening lead-nodes couplings.

AB The structural, electronic and optical properties of RbSnCl3 are investigated by the first-principles calculations. Two new phases of Cm and Imm2 are predicted and the phonon spectrum are analyzed, which shows that the two phases are all dynamically stable. The band edge positions show that the two phases conform to the criteria of photocatalysts for water splitting, and strains are added to the two phases. The results show that strains can effectively tune the bandgaps and RbSnCl3 is potential candidate for solar energy conversion and photocatalytic water splitting.

AB The binding affinity of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs) to bone mineral surface is important to its uptake, release, and diffusion within bone. However, how molecular structures of NBPs influence the binding affinity has not reached conclusions through experimental measurements. We examined the binding free energies of zoledronate (ZOL), risedronate (RIS), pamidronate (PAM), alendronate (ALN), and ibandronate (IBN) to neat and protonated hydroxyapatite surfaces through molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling. The computed binding free energy rank was ALN > PAM > ZOL > IBN > RIS which was not only qualitatively but also quantitatively consistent with NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry studies.

AB Second order Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory with 6-311 + +G (d, p) as well as aug-cc-pvtz basis sets are applied to find the minimum number of water molecules necessary to transform the neutral form of amino-acids into the zwitterionic form by inhibiting infra-molecular proton transfer. Electrostatic and polarization interactions are responsible for the stability of the zwitterionic form in water. It is observed that three to six water molecules serve as the minimum number required to transform the neutral form into the zwitterion of all the amino acids studied here. The vibrational spectra of neutral and zwitterionic forms are clearly distinguishable.

AB Mesoporous C@ZnO hollow nanospheres were prepared by carbon sphere template. The influence of defects and surface state on photocatalytic performance was studied. The photocatalytic activity of C@ZnO nanospheres without treatment is the worst, that of the sample via pickling and annealing is secondary, and the pickling sample is the best. The improved performance can be attributed to the reduction of defects, which suppress the charge recombination. This work helps us better understand the important effects of defects on photocatalytic properties, and provides us with a feasible way to improve the UV photocatalytic activity of ZnO and other metal oxide.

Their electrochemical performance as Li-ion battery anodes has been found to be strongly dependent on the composition and morphology. Among the obtained materials, Bi2WO6/WO3(H2O)(0.33) exhibits the highest capacity and best cycling stability with a reversible discharge capacity of 391 mAh g(-1) the end of 100 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). Bi2WO6 nanosheets possess more stable cycling performance than Bi3.84W0.16O6.24 nanoparticles and Bi2W2O9 block. For Bi2WO6 nanosheets, the thinner the sheets, the better the electrochemical cyclic stability.

AB The ionic reaction products of the title pyridines with iodine in low-density polyethylene are identified by comparison of their IR spectra with literature data. The bis(pyridine)iodine(I), bis(4-methylpyridine)iodine(I), and bis(tert-butylpyridine)iodine(I) cations are spontaneously formed in the polymer medium. At elevated temperature, the 4-methylpyridinium cation is identified as a product of the reaction between 4-methylpyridine and iodine. In spite of their elongated molecular shape, the bis(pyridine)iodine(I) and bis(4-methylpyridine) iodine(I) cations are randomly aligned in stretched polyethylene; they probably form micro-crystalline polyiodide aggregates in the amorphous regions of the polymer. In contrast, the bis(tert-butylpyridine)iodine(I) cation is efficiently aligned in stretched polyethylene.

AB Mesoporous alumina modified by silica (MA-S) with good thermal stability was prepared by a self-assembly method. The morphology and microstructure of as-prepared samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and so on. Though adding 5 wt% SiO2 in Al2O3 framework, the MA-S exhibited high thermal stability and large specific surface area (87 m(2) g(-1)) at 1200 degrees C. The results indicated that SiO2 can suppress the phase transformation from gamma-Al2O3 to alpha-Al2O3 and postpone the crystallization temperature at same time. Therefore, the as-prepared materials possess a great potential for application at high temperature.

AB Bi2WO6/BiOI composites with enhanced photocatalytic performance were constructed in-situ by a hydrothermal routine. The Bi2WO6/BiOI composites were studied by Brunauer -Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), electron spin-resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results support the coexistence of Bi2WO6 and BiOI in the composites. All the Bi2WO6/BiOI composites display higher separation rate of photoinduced carriers than BiOI. (OH)-O-center dot and O-2(-) were formed in the composite photocatalytic system. Finally, a direct Z-scheme was proposed for the Bi2WO6/BiOI composites.

AB The optical absorption spectra of phthalide in polar (methanol) and nonpolar (n-hexane) solvents are recorded. The electronic phthalide spectrum was calculated by TDDFT B3LYP/6-311 + G(d, p) using the polarisable continuum model. Based on an analysis of calculation data and the displacement of absorption bands in a polar solvent, it was established that the absorption bands of phthalide at energies of 3.51 and 3.96 eV correspond to singlet-triplet transitions to the T-1 and T-2 states, respectively.

AB We have found dimeric forms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (di-PAH) molecules by quantum chemical calculations. Geometry optimization starting from short distances of ca. 0.15 nm between two PAH molecules placed in parallel gave cage structures of di-PAH with CC bond connections forming four-membered rings between the PAH molecules. The di-PAH molecules are located in sufficiently deep potential energy wells surrounded by high energy barriers, although their energies are much higher than those of the isolated two PAH molecules.

AB In this work, we construct the C2N/InSe heterostructure and investigate its electronic properties as well as the effect of strain and electric field. Our results demonstrate that the weak van der Waals interactions are dominated in such heterostructure. It forms the type-II band alignment and implies the spatial separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. The type-II band alignment can be switched to type-I one and an indirect to direct band gap transition can be achieved by applying the electric field or vertical strain. Our findings demonstrate that the C2N/InSe heterostructure can be considered to be a good candidate for optoelectronic and nanoelectronic devices.

AB The impact of the polaron concentration on the temperature-mediated charge transport in one-dimensional organic materials is studied. Within the scope of a tight-binding description, our findings reveal that high-temperature diffusivity tends to increase as polaron concentration increases. Moreover, the activation energy for the polaron transport also increases with polaron concentration. Importantly, the polaron diffusivity follows an Arrhenius-like behavior with low activation energy.

AB To increase the specific surface area of nanotubes, we form large diameter nanotubes with double-layer structure by anodizing Ti foils in high concentration H3PO4 and fluoride-containing mixed electrolyte without annealing rather than in pure NH4F electrolyte. This double-layer structure consists of the anions-contaminated layer and the barrier layer. Owing to the addition of PO43- ions into electrolyte, the thickness of the anions-contaminated layer and the diameter of the nanotubes increased. Compared to single-layer structure, this double-layer structure exhibits similar to 5.81 times increase in specific surface area of nanotubes because of the multi-hole interface between the two layers for supercapacitors.

The composite materials with RGO decorated Sb2S3 nanorods show higher specific surface area, higher capacity, superior rate capability and improved cycling performance versus anode with pristine Sb2S3 nanorods. Current improved anode materials deliver an initial reversible capacity of 652 mAh g(-1) at a constant current density of 100 mA g(-1). After 60 cycles the specific capacity is 80.3% of the initial performance. The excellent electrochemical performance indicates RGO decorated Sb2S3 nanorods is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries.

AB ZnFe2O4 ferrite nanoparticles are arousing a great interest in the biomedical field, in particular for magnetic hyperthermia application, thanks to their beneficial physical and chemical properties. Here, we report the discovery of a magnetocaloric effect at low temperature in ZnFe2-xLaxO4 ferrite nanoparticles (<= 10 K). Indeed, sol-gel technique was employed to synthesize ZnFe2-xLaxO4 (x = 0.00, 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01) spinel. Structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of ZnFe2-xLaxO4 spinel were investigated in detail. The XRD results show that the crystallite size was reduced with the increase in La s+ cations. Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric response of ZnFe2-xLaxO4 ferrite have been studied as a function of La3+ concentration. It was demonstrated that, Neel temperature (T N ) decreased slightly with the La3+ content. Furthermore, the magnetic moment decreased with the addition of La3+ cations. The peak of magnetic entropy change (-Delta S-M(max)) slowly decreased. Interestingly, a notable increase in the value of the relative cooling power (RCP) was observed with La3+ doping.

AB Cooperativity is an important and ubiquitous concept whose origin is still not well appreciated. Using the new quantitative measure of this concept that we recently proposed, in this work, we investigate the origin of negative cooperativity for two ionic systems, either a lithium cation or fluorine anion embedded in an argon cluster with up to 20 argon atoms. This measure is found to be strongly correlated with thermochemistry quantities like enthalpy and Gibbs free energy. Dependences of negative cooperativity on density functionals and basis set are examined. Two energy decomposition schemes are employed to investigate the origin of the cooperativity effect. Quantities from the information-theoretic approach have also been utilized to pinpoint the origin. We find that the characteristics of negative cooperativity for ionic clusters is its strong correlation with information gain and Renyi entropy, which are closely related to nucleophilicity, nucleophilicity, and quantum entanglement. These results should shed new light in appreciating cooperativity effect and its impact on chemical reactivity in many chemical and biological systems.

AB Our study of the properties of nickel-titanium alloys subjected to external exposure provides a new insight into the origin of the magnetization effect emerging in these alloys. It is shown to be associated with the nonzero magnetic moments of cluster structures formed under these conditions. The calculated mass magnetization agrees well with the experimental one. All calculations are carried out in the framework of the density functional theory (DFT/PBE and DFT/PZ) using plane wave basis sets and additionally verified by the multiple scattering method.

AB A double-function SiO2 coating with antireflection and superhydrophobic properties was fabricated through a cost-effective and time-efficient sol-gel method. Tetraethoxysilane was used as a precursor to obtain SiO2 with an antireflection property. Hexamethyldisilazane was used as a modifier to produce SiO2-DMS with a superhydrophobic behaviour. The SiO2-DMS coating had a water contact angle of 153 degrees and a water slide angle of < 10 degrees. The optimised SiO2-DMS coating had an average transmittance of 96.07% at a wavelength of 300-800 nm. The entire process could be completed in a short time.

AB A novel three dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 with an ordered distribution of macropores in the diameter of 270 nm is synthesized by a facile colloidal polystyrene template sol-gel and ice-water quenching method. The performance of photocatalytic removal of NO from continuous air flow with visible light irradiation show 3DOM Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 has enhanced efficiency under visible light irradiation. The improved photocatalytic efficiency could contribute to the presence of Ti3+ doping induced by ice-water quenching and the 3DOM structure with a large specific surface area.

AB Interconnected carbon nanosheets anchored with Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4@CNS) composite was prepared via a scalable method involving spray drying and high-temperature calcination processes. Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an average diameter about 13 nm were uniformly distributed on the carbon nanosheets. A broad absorption bandwidth (RL < -10 dB) of 7.99 GHz (9.67-17.66 GHz, corresponding the wavelength range of 3.10-1.70 cm) was achieved with the thickness of 2.8 mm, and the minimum reflection loss of - 41.2 dB was obtained with the thickness of 3.0 mm. It is believed that the Fe3O4@CNS nanocomposite with high-performance electromagnetic wave absorption can be a promising candidate for practical application.

AB Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was utilized in operando to analyze redox mechanisms in lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathode material during battery cycling. In the pristine battery, a considerable amount of paramagnetic Co2+ was detected that was formed during initial contact of the electrolyte with the LCO. The Co2+ got oxidized during the formation cycle. The absence of an EPR signal during subsequent battery cycles, irrespective of the state-of-charge, indicates that no EPR active Co4+ is formed. This suggests the presence of an anionic oxygen redox mechanism in the active material.

Ethylenediamine molecules participate in cross-linking of resorcinol and aldehyde, whereas the formed resin molecules bridge with Pluronic F127 via hydrogen bonding during hydrothermal process, leading to the formation of nitrogen-containing carbons with ordered mesostructure during pyrolysis at 800 degrees C. The obtained nitrogen-containing carbon had a large surface area and pore volume, nitrogen incorporated into carbon frameworks was capable for enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity.

AB The effect of the protonation state of the hydroxyl-ethylthiamin diphosphate intermediate, HEThDP, on the enzyme-substrate interactions and their consequences on the biosynthesis of R-phenylacetylcarbinol, R-PAC, by the acetohydroxy acid synthase, AHAS, is addressed by molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the form of HEThDP, which favors the formation of R-PAC, is that having the 4-aminopyrimidine ring with the N1' atom protonated and the N4' atom as aminopyr-imidinium ion. Under this form both active sites of AHAS have the ability to perform the catalysis, unlike that observed for the other possible protonation states of N1' and N4' atoms.

AB A new octupolar compound 2,4,6-tris{4[4-(dibutylamino)phenylethynyllphenyl]-1,3,5-triazine was synthesized and characterized. The first hyperpolarizability beta of it has been investigated by Hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) measurements. A facile data processing method was proposed to eliminate the influence of the relatively weak three-photo-absorption induced fluorescence (3PF) irradiated by laser beam at lambda = 1500 nm. The values of beta(1500) and beta(0)(1500) are close to those obtained at lambda = 1600 nm laser beam at which no multi-photon-absorption induced fluorescence is detected, validating this method. This method is useful for the investigation of the first hyperpolarizability beta with weak absorption induced fluorescence.

AB Shannon entropy (S), Fisher information (I) and a measure equivalent to Fisher-Shannon complexity (C-IS) of a rovibrational state of diatomic molecules (O-2, O-2(+), NO, NO+) with generalized Kratzer potential is analyzed. Exact analytical expression of I-r is derived for the arbitrary state, whereas the same could be done for I-p with {n, l, m = 0} state. It is found that shifting from neutral to the cationic system, I-r increases while S-r decreases, consistent with the interpretation of a localization in the probability distribution. Additionally, this study reveals that C-IS increases with the number of nodes in a system.

AB Constructed wetland (CW) systems are increasingly implemented as appropriate water treatment facilities, the efficiency of which varies with time due to possible malfunctions such as clogging related to excessive loads of suspended solids or inadequate CW sizing. Numerical flow modeling was used to evaluate filtering performance and to improve the design of CWs. Such modeling usually involves the so-called van Genuchten-Mualem (vGM) soil hydrodynamic parameters which are difficult to measure. This paper focuses on the sensitivity of the model with respect to the vGM parameters revealing a predominant influence of the shape parameters and the saturated conductivity of the filter on the piezometric heads, during feeding and drainage. A simple, robust and low-cost inverse modeling approach, deterministic and stochastic, for the identification of the soil hydrodynamic properties from piezometric heads measured during successive storm events is also presented. The temporal variability of hydrodynamic parameters was assessed and analyzed with regards to modeling efficiency. Principal component analysis showed that the estimated hydrodynamic parameters from the feeding and drainage sub-periods were significantly different.

AB Environmental flow, one of the main restoration measures for regulated rivers, aims to restore and sustain degraded riparian ecosystems and the human wellbeing that depends on these ecosystems with a reasonable magnitude, frequency, duration and timing of water flow. However, efficacies of environmental flows are often restrained by other demands along the river and inappropriate water management, leading to only spatially limited habitats being suitable for ecosystem functioning. This paper presents current restoration measures in the lower reaches of the Tarim riparian ecosystem in Northwest China and analyzes ecohydrological dynamics as a function of environmental flows. The groundwater level oscillation before/after and during the environmental flows (i.e., manmade water diversion) was examined, and the Mann-Kendall test was applied to identify the overall trend of change in groundwater depth from 2003 to 2011. The growth, distribution, health status (referred to as "vitality") and renewal potentials of the dominant tree species Populus euphratica were quantified by using individual-based repeated measurements of P. euphratica morphology in two sampling sites (a 100-ha permanent plot and five random sampling plots with 50-m radii) at Arghan village in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. Based on these measurements, the effects of restoration measures on the groundwater recharge and the revitalization of degraded trees were assessed. The main contribution and achievements of the water diversion project on rehabilitation of the degraded riparian forests were evaluated; further, the limitations and challenges faced by of the restoration project were examined. The results of this research could help establish a reference for monitoring changes in riparian forests in Central Asia and possibly recommend restoration measures for riparian forest ecosystems in arid regions worldwide.

AB In this paper, we analysed the pollutant removal efficiency and reliability of a vertical and horizontal flow hybrid constructed wetland (CW) planted with giant miscanthus and Jerusalem artichoke. The wastewater treatment plant, located in south-eastern Poland, treated domestic sewage at an average flow rate of 1.2 m(3).d(-1). The tests were carried out during. 5-years of operation of the sewage treatment plant (2011-2016). During this period, sewage samples were collected from three stages of wastewater treatment in four seasons (winter - February, spring - May, summer - August, and autumn - November). The following parameters were measured: BOD5, COD, total suspended solids, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. The average effectiveness of organic pollutant removal expressed by BOD5 and COD was 98.8 and 97.6%, respectively, and the removal efficiency for total suspended solids was 93%. The average values of BOD5, COD, and total suspended solids in wastewater discharged to the receiver were significantly lower than the limit values required in Poland. The efficiency of total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal was 64.1 and 68.1%, respectively, and the average values of these components in the outflow from the treatment plant exceeded the standard levels. A reliability analysis performed using the Weibull probability model showed that the reliability of pollutant removal in the tested CW system was very high for BOD5 and COD (100%). It was also demonstrated that the tested CW did not provide effective elimination of biogenic elements (nitrogen and phosphorus), as evidenced by the low reliability values -32 and 28%, respectively. The investigated hybrid CW system with giant miscanthus and Jerusalem artichoke removed organic and biogenic pollutants with a similar efficiency as systems using classic plant species such as reed and willow.

AB Microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a promising soil stabilization method performed by stimulating soil microbes that are naturally occurring and ubiquitous in soil systems. The precipitated carbonate acts as a cementation agent to bind loose soil at grain to grain contacts. MICP has been extensively tested and proven in laboratory environments, as well as in limited field trials; however, long term field applications still remain challenging, partly due to quality control and monitoring issues. Induced polarization (IP), an established geophysical method in mineral exploration, is a prime candidate for MICP monitoring and characterization. This study presents the geophysical results of a 15-day field-scale MICP project. The MICP treatment involved the injection of molasses (carbon source for microbial proliferation) and urea in a Ca2+ rich aquifer. IP monitoring successfully delineated, spatially and temporally, the propagation of MICP in the treatment area, while common resistivity measurements failed to capture any MICP related changes. Reduced hydraulic conductivity in the treatment area versus untreated area, further supports that MICP has changed the physical properties of the subsurface. Furthermore, conventional geochemical monitoring as well as X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed carbonate precipitation in samples from discrete wells in the treatment area.

AB Many anthropic activities generate soil disturbances, favoring competitive, fast growing invasive plant species at the expense of natives. Active restoration of invasion-resistant plant communities is increasingly recognized as a relevant strategy to combat invasive plant colonization in disturbed areas, but results are often unsatisfying. Historical effects, referred as "priority effects" (i.e. the effects generated by the order in which species arrive at a local site), can have a major role in community assembly and invasion success because they involve early colonists altering the performance of later colonists. Taking these priority effects into account in restoration projects is emerging as a relevant way to improve native species restoration success and prevent invasion. The present review discusses two strategies considering priority effects that would help to achieve the classic restoration goal of "more natives, less invasives". The first strategy relies on tackling priority effects of invasive plants using different management options adapted to local environmental conditions, including removal, reduction of propagule sources, or mitigation of soil legacies. Indeed, invasive plants often generate strong priority effects providing themselves a substantial competitive advantage through early emergence and quick growth, but also self-induced soil modifications that can persist after their removal or death, commonly termed "soil legacies". In fertile and stable conditions, the reduction of invasive species priority effects must be coupled with the restoration of an invasion-resistant native plant cover to avoid reinvasion and secondary invasions. The second strategy is to bring about situations in which the restored native species are more likely to exert strong priority effects, decreasing invasion success. For this purpose, we sketch possible options open to restorationists based on resource or non-resource mechanisms. First, we discuss ways to maximize resource preemption by extending the time advance given to restored native species and manipulating restored species characteristics. Second, we consider the potential effect of increasing niche overlap between native and invasive species. Third, we introduce the potential manipulations of non-resource mechanisms, such as allelopathy, herbivory, disease, or the presence of mycorrhizae, to increase priority effects. This review incorporates recent research on priority effects to draw the outlines of priority effects-based restoration strategies and define future research questions that need to be addressed to test and improve these strategies.

AB Benzotriazole, a common anti-corrosion additive in vehicle antifreeze products, is a polar contaminant frequently detected in urban runoff, particularly in cold seasons. Urban low impact development systems such as bioretention cells have shown promise to mitigate traditional stormwater contaminants. However, to date, their efficiency to reduce pollution by polar trace organic chemicals is unclear. In this study, the adsorption and desorption potential of benzotriazole to bioretention soil and hardwood mulch was investigated at varying temperature and salinity levels. The lower organic matter quality of bioretention mulch than soil, likely due to the dominance of lignin in the former and proteins in the latter, resulted in a higher affinity of benzotriazole on soil than mulch. The adsorption capacity increased with decreasing temperature. The low enthalpy changes of -5.6 (soil) and -14 kJ/mol (mulch) suggested adsorption via van der Waals forces and dipole-dipole interactions, respectively. Conversely, changes in salinity showed little effect on the adsorption of benzotriazole. Desorption was observed for both bioretention substrates, but was lowest at low benzotriazole concentrations. Altogether, despite low to moderate adsorption coefficients, these results showed that bioretention cells are able to retain benzotriazole particularly in cold climate conditions.

AB Many former mine sites have substrates that are very infertile and stressful and must rely on natural primary succession in order to recover a natural plant formation. It is often assumed that these stressful abiotic conditions alone are responsible for the speed of succession, but theory predicts that abiotic stress interacts strongly with levels of anthropic biomass disturbance. We conducted vegetation surveys on a long-term (similar to 50 years) tailings storage area on a gold mine site, and measured substrate properties (elemental composition, water content, pH), vegetation cover and species composition, as well as levels of human disturbance. Although the substrate was extremely infertile, vegetation cover on these substrates varied from completely denuded areas to forested areas. The main determinant of the amount of vegetation cover was the level of human disturbance, not abiotic conditions. Both abiotic conditions and levels of human disturbance determined the composition of the vegetation. These results highlight the fact that even low levels of human disturbance can have large impacts on the speed of primary succession on these sites.

AB Soil erosion is a widespread environmental problem, which threatens the environmental sustainability. The northwest arid region (NAR) in China is known as one of the most severe soil loss in the world that suffering from wind erosion. Based on the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ), the spatio-temporal change of wind erosion was identified, and the underlying drivers and influencing factors of soil erosion process were investigated. In addition, the implications of constraint effects in soil erosion control were discussed. The results showed that the wind erosion from 1990 to 2013 was substantially lessened, and the government-aided desertification prevention and control programs, as well as increasing precipitation and decreasing wind speed might have contributed to these trends. The constraint line analyses indicated that the vegetation cover had nonlinear and threshold effects on soil erosion through constraining the water condition (precipitation). Specifically, when the precipitation is below the threshold (approximately 50-100 mm yr(-1) in the NAR), the precipitation (water condition) is not sufficient to maintain a good vegetation cover (about 20-40%), therefore the vegetation cannot efficiently prevent wind erosion. However, once the precipitation exceeds this threshold, the vegetation's sand retention function will enhance and thereby reducing soil loss substantially. Vegetation cover has a lower and an upper threshold for controlling wind erosion. A plant cover lower than 10% does little to reduce wind velocity at the soil surface. The effect of vegetation on reducing wind erosion basically reaches the maximum when plant cover is 40% or above. The constraint effects of precipitation on vegetation cover in the arid region should be considered to improve the efficiency of afforestation and reforestation efforts aiming at mitigating and preventing soil loss.

AB Nitrate (NO3-) removal rates in a denitrifying woodchip bioreactor (DWB) removing NO3- from mine water in a subarctic climate was modeled with the purpose of determining the processes controlling variability in NO3- removal rates over time. The Eyring equation was used to define the temperature dependency, while a rate law was used to describe the NO3- concentration dependency of the NO3- removal rates. The results show that the temperature and NO3- concentration dependency of the NO3- removal rates changes over time in the DWB due to the preferential selection of conceptualized NO3- - reducing bacteria favoring low temperatures, with the mean temperature optimum of the NO3- reducing consortium decreasing from 24.2 degrees C to 16.0 degrees C following the first year of DWB operations. It is suggested that the selection of the low temperature NO3- reducers in the DWB represented an increased dependence on cross-feeding between a fermentative community, producing the reactive organic carbon substrate, and a denitrifying community, consuming the organic carbon substrate, with the temporal variability in NO3- removal rates being controlled by the stabilization of the microbial community structure. It is also suggested that the life expectancy of DWBs is more related to the stability of the cross-feeding between the fermenting microbial community and the denitrifying microbial community, than to the total carbon content.

AB Plants are subjected to various environmental stressors, both natural and artificial. Environmental stressors that lead to an excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may adversely affect physiology and well-being of organisms. The amount of ROS, therefore, could potentially be used to quantify environmental stresses in plants. In this study, the effect of changes in the water levels and elevation at which plants are located was examined in the drawdown zone of a flood control dam (Miharu dam), located in Fukushima in northern Japan. The Salix subfragilis willows are an important plant species in the reservoir as these plants are resistant to prolonged submerged conditions and provide the most suitable habitat for the growth and reproduction of many aquatic organisms. S. subfragilis growing in the drawdown zone exhibited high mortality rates from 2008 to 2016. Leaf samples of S. subfragilis were collected in the drawdown zone at different elevations shortly after drawdown (June), and several months after drawdown (August and October). The samples were taken under light exposure; additionally, dark-adapted (30 min) samples were collected in order to evaluate photosystem-induced ROS generation. The mortality rate of S. subfragilis trees was abnormally high over the previous years, particularly at higher elevated sites. Foliar H2O2 concentrations were significantly increased in samples collected at August and October samples, compared to June samples. Catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and guaiacol peroxidase activities were also increased, corresponding with the H2O2 content. No significant difference in H2O2 concentrations was found between samples from the lower edge of the drawdown zone and those collected at constantly inundated sites. The H2O2 concentration of light-and dark-treated samples indicated that there was no additional ROS accumulation due to photosynthesis. The results indicated that the high mortality of the trees was associated with long-term exposure to drought conditions due to the drawdown, although this was not confirmed by conventional monitoring. These findings support the use of H2O2 as an environmental stress indicator in vegetation management.

AB The proper estimation of streamflow (Q) and suspended sediment (SS) have important implications for sustainable water management. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a distributed, physically-based and dynamic model that integrates water quantity and quality routines. SWAT is considered an effective tool for assessing water and soil resources problems in a worldwide range of environmental conditions; however every hydrological model application is limited by the choices made in the calibration process. The aim of this paper was to assess the differences between the sequential and simultaneous calibration methods when simulating streamflow and suspended sediment with SWAT. We used the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) combined with SWAT for: (i) sensitivity analysis; (ii) parameter calibration using Q and SS data with a combined multi-site and multi-objective approaches; and (iii) evaluation of the differences in the estimated uncertainty of both calibration methods. Our results suggest that the simultaneous calibration was more accurate, especially for SS values with King-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) objective function. The simultaneous calibration was less time consuming and the sensitivity analysis indicated that it needed less parameters in the calibration process. The multisite calibration method improved the model results in 3 out of 4 simulations of suspended sediment in the basin outlet.

AB The rise of restoration projects on large rivers is a response to the increasing human-induced pressures on these ecosystems. Despite this, there is a relative lack of data documenting restoration success using macroinvertebrate communities in such environments, with those existing frequently producing contrasting results. Here, we examined post-restoration responses of macroinvertebrates following a unique experimental restoration approach based on controlled bank erosion and artificial groyne implementation, initiated in 2013 on the Old Rhine River (France-Germany). We investigated how macroinvertebrate communities have responded to restoration-induced variations in three main abiotic parameters, i.e. water depth, flow velocity and substrate type, by comparing the restored section with unrestored ones. The Eco-hydro-morphological index (EHMID), a modified version of a hydro-morphological diversity index, showed a gain in mesohabitat heterogeneity along the whole site. Newly created mesohabitats with low flow velocity and finer substrate were dissimilar to those along the rest of the Old Rhine channel, favouring burrowing taxa such as Odonata. The presence of such insect larvae was related to the post-restoration emergence of typical alluvial terrestrial-aquatic border connectivity, and the rise in macrophytes over time. On the whole site, changes in composition or in functional profile diversity were highly related to the high degree of mesohabitat heterogeneity from the restored section, which would persist as long as groynes remain. The main inter-annual effect concerned the decrease in invasive taxa abundance that also varied according to any changes in fluvial forms. Our findings confirmed that macroinvertebrate responses are highly influenced by hydrological events and are dependent on the study-scale monitoring, clearly putting forward fine-scale hydromorphological gradients. Biological results from this restoration project should approach those obtained in smaller rivers restored using deflectors, suggesting a potential application of the hydraulic law of similarities. However, the accuracy of biological prediction using said application is limited by the distance from source populations, biological invasions and internal river dynamics.

TI Optimization of linear stream temperature model parameters in the soil
   and water assessment tool for the continental United States

AB The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a watershed model that has been commonly used to simulate hydrological and biogeochemical processes in natural as well as human-modified landscapes. Currently, the SWAT model simulates stream temperature using a sub-model involving linear regression of water temperature on observed air temperature. The use of constant universal regression coefficients in this sub-model, however, significantly limit the model's ability to estimate temperatures in stream networks throughout the continental United States, especially when water temperatures vary due to a combined effect of climate, topography, land use, and hydrologic processes. We present a methodology to improve SWAT's default stream temperature sub-model by optimizing geographic-specific values of coefficients in the regression model. Specifically, the coefficients were optimized to better represent observed stream temperature data at 408 stations across the continental United States. Different models were also constructed for each of the four seasons at each of the 408 locations. The spatially and seasonally varying optimized model parameters led to consistent model improvements when compared with observed data for all 408 locations and for all seasons. The median seasonal NSE improved from 0.58 to 0.77 in the Fall, -3.40 to 0.30 in the Winter, 0.26 to 0.67 in the Spring, and -1.01 to 0.36 in the Summer. The simplicity of the proposed approach provides SWAT model practitioners an easy and flexible solution to seasonally and geographically adjust the stream temperature sub-model, and to better represent local conditions.

AB Land degradation is a global environmental problem that threatens human safety and socioeconomic development. In order to alleviate severe soil erosion, China has implemented historically unprecedented large-scale afforestation. In this study, we selected the most severely eroded Loess Plateau as a case, to assess the effectiveness of soil and water conservation (SWC) efforts based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation. In addition, the underlying drivers for soil erosion changes and hydrological effects of SWC were investigated, and finally the potential policy implications of our findings were discussed. The soil erosion intensity from 2000 to 2015 was weakened largely due to favorable climate conditions and SWC efforts, which promoted vegetation restoration and enhanced soil retention. However, there was a significant trade-off between water provision and soil retention functions. The excessively artificial afforestation reduced sediment yield but depleted surface runoff. Furthermore, artificial afforestation and increasing irrigation water consumption overused groundwater resources and finally lowered groundwater table. The SWC efforts characterized by artificial afforestation induced soil moisture declining, particularly for the conversion type of farmland to forest/ shrub. Our results suggested that afforestation might be a poor choice in arid and semiarid regions, because it did not consider local precipitation conditions, and have exacerbated water shortages and offset SWC efforts. Therefore, the future ecological restoration efforts should be transformed from simple species-based measures to optimal plant species combinations to minimize the tradeoff between water yield and soil retention. The strategies for ecological restoration of drylands should also account for water balance to ensure effectiveness and sustainability.

AB The results of long-term screening of sediments from the Czech Republic from 2011 to 2017 are presented, more than 80% of the samples of which were taken from fishponds. The total sediment volume of Czech Republic fishponds is estimated to be 197 mil. m(3). Quality of the sediment is impacted by numerous factors. Sediment may be used for land application, etc., as long as it abides with legislation limits. All results from our database, containing some 200 sites, have been compared with the Decree regulating the conditions for the application of sediments on agricultural land.
   We have evaluated toxic metals (As, Pb, Zn, Cu, Hg, Cd), organic pollutants (C10-C40, BTEX, PAH, PCB, DDT) and nutrient volume. The assessment of results reveal the average concentrations of evaluated metals to have the following ranking: Zn > Cu > Pb > As > Cd > Hg. The most frequent excesses of the limit listed in Decree No. 257/2009 Sb. were reported for cadmium (21 sites, i. e. 13.2%). In the case of organic pollutants, the worst pollutant exceeded the limits for 7.2% of sites. DDT volume values were all below the threshold. The ratio between available nutrients and overall nutrient volume was: 0.5% P; 1.3% N; 48.1% Na; 20.4% Mg; 5.8% K; and 65.7% Ca.

AB Societies around the world face difficult choices in allocating fresh water between human uses and environmental flows for freshwater ecosystems. In many regions, policy makers are developing water conservation plans that set ambitious targets for reduced water consumption. These plans often rely on incentives, rather than regulation, to achieve water savings. However, water managers and conservation groups lack guidance on the most cost-effective locations and times for incentivizing water conservation. Here, we develop a spatial planning framework that enables conservation practitioners to strategically allocate incentives for water conservation actions to balance ecosystem and societal needs for water. We apply this model to the Red River (USA) and draw three main conclusions. First, even optimal allocation of water across the network cannot simultaneously meet societal and environmental flow targets given current water availability and societal usage. Second, modest reductions in societal water usage (e.g., 1-3%) can significantly reduce water conflicts in the basin, but only when these water conservation actions are strategically allocated in time and space. Third, however, substantial reduction in societal water usage (> 21%) is needed to fully satisfy societal and environmental flow goals. We discuss future research directions in the Red River and the transferability of our results to other drought-prone river networks worldwide.

AB Spatial patterns of plant species diversity, functional diversity, and aboveground plant biomass, and their relationships with environmental factors in the Aerjin Mountain Nature Reserve (AMNR) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China were examined in this study. The transect-quadrat sampling method was applied to sample the plant species and functional diversity and the aboveground plant biomass. Statistical package F-diversity v. 2011 was used to calculate the functional diversity index. OriginPro 9.0 drawing software was used to diagram 3-dimensional (longitudinal, latitudinal, and altitudinal) distribution patterns of plant diversity, plant biomass and environmental factors. Correlations among plant biomass, species diversity, functional diversity, and environmental factors were analyzed by using SPSS16.0. The results indicated that alpine steppe was the major vegetation type in high-altitude areas of the southwestern region of the AMNR, alpine wet meadow and alpine steppe were the major vegetation types in low altitude areas of the northeastern region of the AMNR. The vegetation types in mid-altitude areas of the northwestern region and low altitude areas of the southeastern region of the AMNR were primarily alpine desert. Plant species diversity and biomass did not vary significantly along latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal gradients. Plant species diversity was positively correlated with soil total nitrogen, total carbon, organic carbon, and moisture. The functional diversity of the plant community was positively correlated with precipitation and soil moisture. Vegetation biomass was positively correlated with soil total nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil moisture, whereas it was negatively correlated with soil bulk density. Plant species diversity was positively correlated with the functional diversity of the plant community. The integrated effects of geographic factors, soil factors, and meteorological conditions contributed to the spatial heterogeneity of species biodiversity and vegetation biomass of the plant communities in the AMNR, whereas the effects of soil and climatic factors were much stronger than those of geographical factors.

AB Monitoring and evaluating forest restoration projects is a challenge especially in large-scale, but the remote monitoring of indicators with the use of synoptic, multispectral and multitemporal data allows us to gauge the restoration success with more accurately and in small time. The objective of this study was to elaborate and compare methods of remote monitoring of forest restoration using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and multispectral imaging from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) camera, in addition to comparing the efficiency of supervised classification algorithms Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Random Forest (RF). The study was carried out in a restoration area with about 74 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A., in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, Near Infrared) on UAV and LIDAR data composition (intensity image, Digital Surface Model, Digital Terrain Model, normalized Digital Surface Model). The monitored restoration indicator was the land cover separated in three classes: canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the ML and RF algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifications, the Overall Accuracy (OA) and the Kappa index were used, and the last was compared by Z test. The area occupied by different land cover classes was calculated using ArcGIS and R. The results of OA, Kappa and visual evaluation of the images were excellent in all combinations of the imaging methods and algorithms analyzed. When Kappa values for the two algorithms were compared, RF presented better performance than ML with significant difference, but when sensors (UAV camera and LIDAR) were compared, there were no significant differences. There was little difference between the area occupied by each land cover classes generated by UAV and LIDAR images. The highest cover was generated for canopy cover followed by grass cover and bare soil in all classified images, indicating the need of adaptive management interventions to correct the area trajectory towards the restoration success. The methods employed in this study are efficient to monitor restoration areas, especially on a large scale, allowing us to save time, fieldwork and invested resources.

AB Dune erosion exposes coastal communities to greater risks of sea level rise, severe storm surge impact, flooding and property damage. This study evaluated the contribution of vegetation roots to dune erosion volume reduction using an analytical solution of a wave impact model. A resistance coefficient obtained from direct field measurements of dune shear strength and root density at South Padre Island, Texas, U.S.A was introduced into the analytical solution. Findings show that resistance of coastal dunes to erosion depends on vegetation type; the average in-situ shear strength of dunes vegetated with monocot species (sea oats) was 41.7 +/- 6.1 KPa which was significantly higher than those vegetated with dicot species (railroad vines, gulf croton and camphor weed) at 22.2 +/- 4.8 KPa. The measured in-situ shear strength of dunes vegetated with sea oats also showed a positive correlation with root density for a limited number of samples. A range of values for a proposed new coefficient of 0.2-0.8 was estimated from the ratio of in-situ shear strength of bare dunes to the shear strength of dunes vegetated with sea oats and proposed for consideration in the wave impact model When applied to the analytical solution of the wave impact model in the collision regime, a lower coefficient value resulted in lower predicted erosion volumes while higher values resulted in higher erosion volume. The results from this study emphasized the importance of suitable dune vegetation for an overall resilient coastal dune system for protection against erosion and this work suggests an approach to help quantify the benefits of the vegetation on erosion mitigation, which was validated through a comparison with field measurements.

AB There is little experimental evidence to guide the design of substrate compaction for the optimal plant water use performance of a landfill phytocap. A glasshouse study was undertaken to address this with aim to evaluate the effect of substrate compaction on the water use of a phytocap plant community. Four levels of relative compaction (RC), i.e. the ratio of dry bulk density over the standard maximum dry bulk density, (72%, 77%, 82%, and 87%) were considered. The native tree and grass species selected were typical of an Australian phytocap plant community: Themeda triandra, Microlaena stipoides, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus cladocalyx, Acacia mearnsii and Allocasuarina verticillata. Plant water use was measured by weight as the difference between planted and unplanted cores over 5 drying periods occurring through the first 6 months of plant establishment traversing winter, spring and summer. Plant water use was optimal for all species at low-intermediate RC (72%, 77% and 82%), and all species except Themeda triandra, were most negatively impacted by the highest RC of 87%. The best linear model based on Akaike's Information Criterion included a second-order term for the continuous fixed factor 'RC' and the categorical fixed factor 'species'. This model showed plant water use to be optimum at a RC of 76.5% and highlighted a wide range of RC's (70-83%), for which plant water use is not < 90% of this optimum. It also highlighted increasing plant water use-sensitivity to RC's beyond these ranges, with a RC > 86% and a RC < 67% leading to reductions in plant water use of 20% or more. Substrate specifications are recommended to optimize phytocap plant water use within achievable RC ranges. These can be generalized beyond application to a single species or substrate texture to inform the design and quality assurance of substrate placement for future landfill phytocaps.

AB Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) are a common best management practice used in agricultural landscapes because of their possible effectiveness to reduce loadings of sediments and nutrients, including phosphorus (P), to adjacent surface waters. In cold climates, buffer vegetation is prone to numerous freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). The freezing may cause plant cells to lyse and release P, which would reduce buffer effectiveness. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to investigate if P fertilization of soils growing timothy grass (Phleum pretense L.) and the number of FTCs affect the type and concentrations of P released from the above-ground biomass. Timothy grass was grown in a greenhouse with and without P fertilizer application. Above-ground biomass was harvested twice: after 65 days of growth and again 37 days later, and these samples were subjected to zero, three, or six FTCs. Water extractions of the above-ground biomass were analysed for water extractable P (WEP) and alkali P with an oxidative agent (P-OH). Above-ground biomass was additionally analysed for nitric acid digested P (P-HNO3). Results from both harvests showed no significant difference in WEP or P-OH concentrations between soil fertilizer treatments, but there was a significant difference in WEP concentrations with increased FTCs. Combined data from both harvests showed that after six FTCs, 65-100% of P-OH was released as WEP, and 19-55% of P-HNO3 was released as WEP. These results indicate that timothy grass undergoing multiple FTCs can become a source of highly bioavailable P and that, as previous work has showed, harvesting vegetation is a potentially useful management practice in order to reduce P losses to surface waters.

AB To date, the process of biodrying has been used for the drying of biodegradable waste materials to produce fuel. However, different applications other than incineration also exist for dried materials: e.g., sewage sludge could be used as a fertilizer. This paper investigates the potential of biodrying as a pretreatment method prior to the application of sewage sludge in agriculture. Experiments were performed in two biodrying reactors with operational volumes of 100 dm(3) using two different aeration regimes to compare the efficiency of the two process alternatives: i) mesophilic conditions and ii) a full composting temperature profile including the thermophilic phase. The influence of the two different operating regimes on the elimination of pathogens and selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) was investigated. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was employed to identify the main groups of microorganisms responsible for the potential elimination of the detected micropollutants. The results showed that antibiotic activity was completely eliminated under both the operational regimes. Bisphenol-A (BPA) and irgasan (IRG) were detected in the untreated sludge, and the elimination efficiency for these substances was greater in the reactor with the mesophilic treatment (max. 88.3% for BPA and 47.7% for IRG) than under thermophilic conditions (60.1% for BPA and no significant removal of IRG). PLFA analysis indicates that Actinobacteria could be responsible for the biodegradation. Of the two indicator microorganisms used for the verification of the efficiency of the improvement in hygiene, only E. coli were completely eliminated under both regimes, while the enterococci content was reduced by 4 orders of magnitude. The results of this study document that the biodrying process possesses the potential for the removal of micropollutants from sewage sludge and might serve as a pretreatment process prior to using the treated sludge in agriculture.

AB Three small catchments (each c. 2 km(2)) with different land cover (drained pasture, wetland and spruce forest) located in the Sumava Mountains in the Czech Republic (altitude 780-1026 m) were monitored continuously for 20 years. The aim of the study was to evaluate the aging of different types of land cover landscape in terms of soil acidification (loss of alkalines). Average annual water discharge from the pasture catchment was c. 60% of annual precipitation, but 38% and 34% of annual precipitation from the wetland and the forest, respectively. The relatively highest water runoff was from the pasture in all months. Daily runoffs during periods of heavy rain were 26mm from the pasture, 16mm from the wetland and 7mm from the forested catchment. Water discharged from the drained pasture had two times higher electrical conductivity than water from the wetland and forest due to higher concentrations of bicarbonate, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. In the wetland and forest catchments, the amounts of nitrate, sulphate, chloride, TC, TN, TP and ammonium in the precipitated water were higher than that of the discharged with water (soluble matter losses). The amount of soluble matter discharged from the pasture catchment (matter losses) was in all cases higher than the amount in the precipitated water. On sunny days in the vegetation season, the pasture catchment had higher surface temperature than the wetland and forest catchments, which had higher evapotranspiration. Thermal pictures from satellites (e.g. Landsat) or taken by airborne thermal cameras can be used for identification of landscape areas of higher water outflow and higher matter losses.

AB Field abandonment is a new threat to the biodiversity of agricultural land, but its impacts on arthropod communities remain unclear. We investigated how field abandonment influences spider abundance and diversity in rice paddy ecosystems. We collected spiders in paddy fields and six types of abandoned fields with different combinations of vegetation successional stage (early, middle, or late) and soil water content (wet or dry) in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. The abundance and species richness of cursorial spiders were higher in the abandoned fields than in the paddy fields, but there was no difference in the case of orb-weavers. Total spider abundance decreased with increasing successional stage, but the responses differed between orb-weavers and cursorial spiders: the abundance of orb-weavers decreased in the middle stage, whereas that of cursorial spiders decreased in the late stage. Soil water content affected only the abundance of orb-weavers: abundance was higher on wet soil than on dry soil. Species richness was not affected by either vegetation succession or soil water content. On the other hand, an individual-based species-accumulation curve showed that rarefied species richness tended to be greater in abandoned fields at the late stage. Ordination analysis showed that species composition clearly differed among paddy and abandoned fields at different successional stages. Our findings suggest that spider abundance and diversity are higher in abandoned fields than in cultivated fields, and that species composition varies depending on field abandonment and succession. Therefore, maintaining cultivated fields and abandoned fields at different successional stages can maintain a high diversity of spiders across rice paddy ecosystems.

AB Open-pit mining activities can cause serious disturbance to the local land and even regional vegetation communities. Vegetation restoration is a crucial approach for maintaining ecological stability in a post-mining area. In this study, the role of the environment factors on vegetation diversity under different restoration years (2a, 5a, 10a and control area) in the largest phosphate mining areas in Southwestern China was evaluated by a multi-model inference (MMI) based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Three competing models of environmental factors included vegetation nutrient content (M1), soil heavy metal content (M2) and human disturbance (M3) were constructed to analyze how they impact vegetation diversity. The results revealed the changing effects of different environmental factors under four restoration stages. Heavy metal content in the soil (M2) had the strongest effect on vegetation diversity in the restoration areas at 2 and 10 years, whereas human disturbance (M3) had the strongest effect in the restoration area at 5 years. In the control area, the vegetation nutrient content (M1) had the strongest effect on vegetation diversity. According to the different models, a comprehensive index of environmental factors (CIEF) was established to build the fitting formula with vegetation diversity. The index could be used for assessing the efficiency of vegetation restoration by comparing the theoretical value and the actual value of Shannon's diversity index in the study area and other phosphate mining areas.

AB Since woody plants like willow are used increasingly in treatment wetlands, there is a growing need to characterize their ecophysiology in these specific growing conditions. For instance, evapotranspiration (ET) can be greatly increased in wetlands, due to factors like high water availability as well as oasis and clothesline effects. Few studies report willow ET rates measured in full-scale constructed wetland conditions, and fewer still in a temperate North-American climate. The objective of this study was to measure and model evapotranspiration of a commonly used willow cultivar, Salix miyabeana (SX67), to provide the ET rates and crop coefficient for this species. During two growing seasons, we studied a 48m(2) horizontal subsurface flow willow wetland located in eastern Canada, irrigated with pretreated wood preservative leachate. Over two seasons, from May to October, we measured a mean monthly evapotranspiration rate of 22.7 mm/day (16.5 mm/d modelled), for a seasonal cumulative ET of 3954mm (2897mm modelled) and a mean crop coefficient of 6.4 (4.2 modelled). Both the evapotranspiration results and leaf area index (LAI) were greater than most results reported for open field willow plantations. Maximal stomatal conductance ((G) over bar (s)) was higher than that expected for deciduous trees and even for wetland plants, and mean values correlated well with temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity and day of the year. We demonstrated that an ET model usin (G) over bar (s), LAI and water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) as parameters could predict the evapotranspiration rate of our wetland. This simplification of traditional ET models illustrates the absence of evapotranspiration limitations in wetlands. Furthermore, this study also highlights some factors that can enhance ET in treatment wetlands. Our results should both improve the design of treatment wetlands using willows, and provide a simple ET predictive model based on major evapotranspiration drivers in wetlands.

AB This study explores the feasibility of using microalgae biomass (Chlorella sp.) as a carbon source to increase the denitrification efficiency of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF-CWs). The results show that a large amount of organic matter is released in the process of microalgal powder decomposition. After alkali pretreatment, enhancements in the cumulative release amount (from 51.3 mg.L-1 to 106.8 mg.L-1) and stable release rate (from 0.13 mg.L-1.h(-1) to 0.25 mg.L-1.h(-1)) of organic matter were observed. The addition of microalgal powder with alkali pretreatment to HSSF-CWs improved the removal of nitrate (NO3--N) by 27.9% and total nitrogen (TN) by 17.7% compared to that without addition. There were limited side effects influencing the release of COD and TP in the effluent. For the treatment of wastewater with a low C/N ratio, it is feasible to add microalgal biomass as an external carbon source to HSSF-CWs to improve denitrification efficiency.

AB The impact of the Three Gorges Dam on the downstream flow regime and carp communities is assessed through a systematic examination of various indicators of hydrology (IHs) recorded during the pre-and post-dam periods. Specifically, the Spearman correlation method is used to identify a number of key indicators better correlated with carp population changes. The range of variability approach (RVA) is then applied to these key IHs to calculate their degree of alteration after the dam impoundment. Also, a new composite index is proposed here to determine the most important IHs. This index quantifies the relative impact among the competing indicators by accounting for both their alteration and correlation levels. It is observed that the presence of Three Gorges Dam disrupts the natural flow patterns and limits the downstream areas to small-scale, short-lived flow events. These flow events are insufficient regarding both the magnitude and duration to satisfy the carps' breeding needs. Among 32 IHs considered here, high-pulse duration and rise rate of discharge or water level are found to be the most important flow properties for the carps' spawning success; at the same time, they are the worst affected by the dam presence. Other indicators, such as base flow discharge and fall rate of discharge, also play a role, as they are adversely affecting the carp fry biomass. The present results are very useful for designing water releases that will be effective in improving the breeding conditions and augmenting the overall carp population.

AB Human disturbance and climate change both influence the input quantity of plant litter, significantly affecting soil respiration (R-s). However, what leads to a change of relationship between R-s in on-litter input (R-s(NL)) and natural litter input (R-s(CL)) is not yet fully understood. This study selected a man-made Populus forest in a dune-meadow transitional region to observe R-s(NL) and R-s(CL), soil temperature and soil moisture at a depth of 0-10 cm, groundwater depth between April and October in 2014 and 2015, and diurnal variations were carried out during the early, middle, and late stages of the growing seasons. Complex R-s diurnal patterns were observed in different growth stages. The soil moisture beyond field capacity inhibited root respiration and soil microbial activities, thus making R-s(NL) smaller than R-s(CL). When soil moisture was below field capacity with the increase of groundwater depth, dry air and low litter moisture content resulted in the shielding effect of the litter on R-s beyond its decomposition, thus making R-s(NL) consistently larger than R-s(CL). The temperature sensitivity was significantly affected by soil moisture. These results indicate that interactions among the quantity of litter, soil temperature, soil moisture and groundwater, which cause diurnal variations in R-s were diverse. Negative litter respiration may not be a measurement error, but caused by soil moisture which changes the relationship between R-s(NL) and R-s(CL). Thus, this study shows that plant litter has a significant influence on R-s in the dune-meadow transitional region. The findings of this study will provide useful information to understand these fragile ecosystems and the terrestrial carbon cycle.

AB Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is a large and economically important crop in the Mediterranean area where the soil conservation is a priority. Some agricultural practices, as green covers, are a promising strategy to protect against erosion and to improve soil microbial biodiversity and physicochemical quality. Here, we investigated the long-term effects of natural green cover, established over 7 years, on the biological and physicochemical characteristics of a clay-loam soil under Mediterranean conditions. Samples were collected in an experimental an experimental Garnacha vineyard, locate in Mallorca (Spain), at two times points in a single year: pre-bud burst (T1) and blooming/flowering (T2). All samples were taken at the trafficked position at 0-10 cm depth. Natural green cover resulted in an increment of 1% of organic carbon content, larger dry aggregate size and a reduction of 0.36 g cm(-3) of bulk density. That supposes a total accumulation, after 7 years of maintenance of the cover, of 5.471 MgC ha(-1)yr(-1) in the 0-10 cm layer. Furthermore, these changes were associated with higher functional microbial community diversity assessed using Biolog (TM) EcoPlates, and a higher density of mycorrhizal spores. We found that the microbial community from soil under green cover was able to degrade ten substances more than microbes from tillage soils. Moreover, cover soil can present double of spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. All these results indicate that the long-term maintenance of the resident species improves the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the soil and provides beneficial agroecosystem services to vineyard.

AB The city of Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) has numerous conventional stormwater retention basins to attenuate stormwater runoff. Significant operational resources are applied to control the proliferation of aquatic macrophytes and filamentous algal mats in these conventional stormwater retention basins to meet the aesthetic expectations of surrounding residents. Recent urban developments in the city of Winnipeg have used constructed wetlands to handle stormwater as opposed to conventional basins. We examined the differences in water quality, greenhouse gas emissions and cumulative greenhouse gas fluxes between conventional stormwater retention basins and urban constructed wetlands. Additionally, we examined how water quality and greenhouse gas emissions were impacted by the removal of submersed aquatic vegetation in conventional stormwater retention basins. Our results indicate large phytoplankton blooms were consistently reduced both pre and post treatment in the urban constructed wetlands (chlorophyll-a = 13 mu g l(-1) and 33 mu g l(-1)) relative to the untreated conventional stormwater retention basins (chlorophyll-a = 56 mu g l(-1) and 128 mu g l(-1)) and treated conventional stormwater retention basins (chlorophyll-a = 58 mu g l(-1) and 405 mu g l(-1)). Mean daily greenhouse gas fluxes were lower pre and post treatment in the urban constructed wetlands (CO(2)eq = 26.5 kg ha(-1) d(-1) and 53.1 kg ha(-1) d(-1)) relative to the untreated (CO(2)eq = 85.5 kg ha(-1) d(-1) and 89.0 kg ha(-1) d(-1)) and treated conventional stormwater retention basins (CO(2)eq = 98.5 kg ha(-1) d(-1) and 129.8 kg ha(-1) d(-1)). Over the 22 week period, mean total basin cumulative CO(2)eq flux was lowest in the urban constructed wetlands (6,447 g ha(-1) d(-1)) compared to the untreated (12,631 g ha(-1) d(-1)) and treated (17,633 g ha(-1) d(-1)) conventional stormwater retention basins. The combined treatments (herbicides and harvesting) applied to the conventional stormwater retention basins to remove aquatic vegetation result in poorer water quality and appear to stimulate methane emissions resulting in noticeably higher cumulative fluxes of greenhouse gases from these basins. The use of urban constructed wetlands in new residential areas should result in enhanced water quality and reduced cumulative greenhouse gas fluxes, while avoiding the cost associated with macrophyte removal.

AB Reduction in runoff and increase in actual evapotranspiration (AET) are two well-known benefits of green roofs. However, few studies have been carried out to investigate how green roofs affect runoff and AET when there is interaction between them. Such interaction is most prominent when green roofs have an additional storage layer. In this study, a modified hydrological model for green roofs is proposed to explicitly describe water retention and release in different layers and during wet/dry periods, which can reflect the interaction between runoff and AET under alternating dry and wet conditions. After calibration and validation with experimental data, the model was used to evaluate the combined effects of runoff reduction and increase in AET for green roofs under moist sub-tropical weather condition (such as Shenzhen, China). The results indicate that the daily AET and event runoff of green roofs decrease with increasing antecedent dry period (ADP); an additional storage layer can increase the ability of green roofs in reducing runoff and increasing AET. Generally, the effect is more pronounce under weather conditions with higher temperature, more rainfall amount and longer ADP. Such results provide hydrologists and engineers with a new and effective tool to simulate and understand the performance of green roofs by considering water retention and release in the layers.

AB We test an innovative approach to beneficially re-use dredged sediment to enhance salt marsh development. A Mud Motor is a dredged sediment disposal in the form of a semi-continuous source of mud in a shallow tidal channel allowing natural processes to disperse the sediment to nearby mudflats and salt marshes. We describe the various steps in the design of a Mud Motor pilot: numerical simulations with a sediment transport model to explore suitable disposal locations, a tracer experiment to measure the transport fate of disposed mud, assessment of the legal requirements, and detailing the planning and technical feasibility. An extensive monitoring and research programme was designed to measure sediment transport rates and the response of intertidal mudflats and salt marshes to an increased sediment load. Measurements include the sediment transport in the tidal channel and on the shallow mudflats, the vertical accretion of intertidal mudflats and salt marsh, and the salt marsh vegetation cover and composition. In the Mud Motor pilot a total of 470,516m(3) of fine grained sediment (D50 of similar to 10 mu m) was disposed over two winter seasons, with an average of 22 sediment disposals per week of operation. Ship-based measurements revealed a periodic vertical salinity stratification that is inverted compared to a classical estuary and that is working against the asymmetric flood-dominated transport direction. Field measurements on the intertidal mudflats showed that the functioning of the Mud Motor, i.e. the successful increased mud transport toward the salt marsh, is significantly dependent on wind and wave forcing. Accretion measurements showed relatively large changes in surface elevation due to deposition and erosion of layers of watery mud with a thickness of up to 10 cm on a time scale of days. The measurements indicate notably higher sediment dynamics during periods of Mud Motor disposal. The salt marsh demonstrated significant vertical accretion though this has not yet led to horizontal expansion because there was more hydrodynamic stress than foreseen. In carrying out the pilot we learned that the feasibility of a Mud Motor depends on an assessment of additional travel time for the dredger, the effectiveness on salt marsh growth, reduced dredging volumes in a port, and many other practical issues. Our improved understanding on the transport processes in the channel and on the mudflats and salt marsh yields design lessons and guiding principles for future applications of sediment management in salt marsh development that include a Mud Motor approach.

AB Hardening of shorelines has been extensively implemented in many parts of the developed world. This also applies to banks of German Federal Waterways, which are mostly fixed by ripraps to prevent bank erosion as a consequence of wave disturbance by shipping traffic. Since ripraps notably alter functions of riparian ecosystems and nature conservation demands recently gained in importance along waterways, alternatives for ripraps play an increasing role.
   Front-fixed banks are ripraps parallel to the shoreline and embedded in the waterway's channel with an unsecured bank of low steepness behind them. Thus, they are suitable to prevent banks from erosion. However, it is unclear how they can contribute to the ecological enhancement of riparian vegetation along waterways.
   Therefore, we compared riparian vegetation of ripraps and front-fixed banks with unsecured banks along the German rivers Main and Danube to assess the ecological efficiency of front-fixed banks. Disturbance by alternating water levels was the lowest at ripraps, whereas disturbance levels were higher at front-fixed and unfortified banks. We used an ordination and indicator species analysis to reveal differences in species composition. The results of the indicator species analysis were analyzed regarding species' biotope origin, light and moisture demand and life strategy. We analyzed species diversity and calculated functional diversity indices to display the prevalent ecosystem processes.
   Higher variation in species composition, common indicator species, a strong vertical layering of woody riparian vegetation and similar site conditions at front-fixed and unfortified banks revealed higher similarities in species composition between them than to other bank type combinations. Limnic species occurred with a higher frequency at unfortified and front-fixed banks, whereas terrestrial species were more frequent at ripraps. Light-tolerant species were more common at ripraps, whereas species' demand for moisture was higher at front-fixed and unfortified banks than at ripraps. Cr-strategists occurred more frequently with increasing disturbance level, whereas c-strategists were more common at ripraps.
   Ripraps had the highest species diversity levels whereas functional diversity tended to be higher at front-fixed and unfortified banks. This indicates a higher trait complementarity and thus a higher specialization towards alternating water levels, wherefore a higher degree of naturalness can be assumed in these habitats.
   Nature conservation efforts along German Federal Waterways should focus on the restoration of flooding dynamics, as species typical for riverine habitats are more common at front-fixed and unfortified banks than at ripraps. Since front-fixed banks bear traits suited for the reconnection of rivers and their floodplains and for bank protection, they are a suitable alternative to promote biodiversity along German Federal Waterways.

AB The importance of geotechnical properties and behavior of wetland soils is underscored by the many studies on wetland loss, e.g., marsh edge erosion, shallow subsidence, wetland collapse, and uprooting. This study provides an overview of using a modified piezocone penetrometer to rapidly evaluate marsh shear strength, porosity, and electrical conductivity over a range of ecological, geological, and hydrologic wetland conditions. Field campaigns were conducted in Terrebonne Bay near Cocodrie, Louisiana to evaluate the efficacy of the cone to characterize the shear strength and stratigraphy of salt marshes. Based on the field measurements, the test method was found to be repeatable and consistent with the ASTM D5778 standard guideline. The piezocone soundings were used to evaluate the shear strength and stratigraphy of the vegetation root mat, organic clay, and inorganic clay layers. These findings were synthesized into an idealized wetland geotechnical framework for developing mechanistic models of wetland loss.

AB Soil carbon is an essential part of the terrestrial carbon pool, which includes soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC). Soils contain a huge amount of inorganic carbon in arid and semiarid regions, which may be a potential source of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. Neglecting soil inorganic carbon could result in erroneous or misleading interpretations of the soil carbon pool of arid and semiarid ecosystems. Nevertheless, only a few studies have focused on variations of SIC, or have further used the soil stable carbon isotope to explore the inherent mechanism of SIC variations in semiarid regions. The study was designed to estimate the dynamic of SOC and SIC with the development of desertification in the topsoil. Here, four desertification stages were chosen, including potential desertification (PD), light desertification (LD), severe desertification (SD), and very severe desertification (VSD) stages, to evaluate the horizontal and vertical distributions of SOC and SIC, and the stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) of SOC and SIC with the desertification development in the topsoil (0-30 cm soil layer). The SOC and SIC contents and storage changed significantly with desertification development. The PD stages had the highest SOC (21.01 mg/hm(2)) and SIC (11.60 mg/hm(2)) storage at 0-30 cm, while the contrary result for VSD stages, with the average of SOC and SIC, was 8.27 mg/hm(2) and 6.15 mg/hm(2), respectively. The vertical distribution of SIC and SOC has varied sharply with soil depth. The delta C-13-SIC within the 0-30 cm soil profile in the PD stages were more negative than those in other desertification stages and gradually increased with desertification development. In contrast, the delta C-13-SOC generally decreased with desertification progress. The entire data (108 soil samples) exhibited that delta C-13-SIC were significantly and negatively correlated with delta C-13-SOC and SIC content, while SIC storage was significantly and positively correlated with SOC storage. The results demonstrated that an increase of SOC might be related to enhancing accumulation of SIC. The results of this study provide information about the variation of SIC and SOC with the desertification development and contribute to our understanding of the important role of SIC in estimating the carbon sequestration capacity in the degraded grassland ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions.

AB Although sprouting, as a functional trait to respond forest disturbances, has been acknowledged, the quantitative data was lacking across disturbance and vegetation types, especially in temperate forests. The damaged areas by the largest recorded East Coast Fire of April 2000 in South Korea, showed strikingly rapid recovery, particularly by woody species that had dominated prefire. Therefore, we proposed two hypotheses: first, this early, quick regeneration was attributed to the sprouting ability of species that existed before the fire. Second, if the first assumption were true, then a fire would not affect the species composition afterward. To test these, we extensively investigated and traced regeneration strategies for all plants within 117 burned and 40 unburned stands in the regions where Pinus densiflora was the dominant species. Regardless of whether stand coverage was high or low, the proportions were constant among the three strategies, i.e., basal sprouting (73.0%), clonal sprouting (22.5%), and seed germination (4.5%). Overall, vegetative coverage due to sprouting accounted for 95.5% of the total. Woody species contributed the most to fast restoration and were regenerated in proportion to prefire tree size. Among all 233 taxa, 81.1% was able to resprout by basal and clonal sprouting. Multivariate analysis supported our hypothesis that the floristic composition, in terms of absence or presence, did not differ between pre- and postfire stands. Biodiversity indices showed a slight increase due to the significant rise in species evenness. Finally, sprouting ability was lacking for Pinus densiflora, the most dominant tree before the fire, it appears that the succession from pine-dominated forest to deciduous forest was accelerated postfire by the release of deciduous species that were previously suppressed in the understory, e.g., Ouercus mongolica, Q. variabilis, Fraxinus sieboldiana, and Lespedeza cyrtobotrya. Indeed, these results suggest that sprouting is prevalent and plays decisive roles. It is highly likely that the species have adapted to a frequent, severe fire regime in the past.

AB The vertical slot fishway (VSF) plays a major role in protection and restoration of migratory fishes at many migratory barriers. However, the VSF design greatly depends on fish response to hydraulics and swimming behavior, which are key to the design of effective VSFs for target fish species. This study evaluated the effects of hydraulic characteristics on movement behavior of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) by combining spatial hydraulic distributions with fish movement trajectories in an experimental VSF. Fish spent more transit times in ranges of velocity (V) with 0.15-0.45 m/s, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) with 0.020-0.043m(2)/s(2), turbulent dissipation rate (TDR) with 0.020-0.065m(2)/s(3) and strain rate (SR) with 2-7 s(-1) under different discharges (18.0L/s and 26.0L/s), respectively. Correlation were found between fish transit times and hydraulic variables of velocity (V) (Q = 18.0 m/s: r = 0.397, P < 0.01; Q = 26.0 m/s: r = 0.407, P < 0.01), turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) (Q = 18.0 m/s: r = 0.476, P < 0.01; Q = 26.0 m/s: r = 0.469, P < 0.01). TKE and V were the key hydraulic parameters associated with the fish transit movement times in VSF. The results provided key hydraulic parameters for bighead carp movement in VSFs, which can serve as reference design for the future VSF and others fishway designs for this species.

In particular, the impacts of different biodiversity indices on the plant diversity-plant productivity relationship of alpine grasslands at different spatial scales of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) require investigation. We investigated the relations of multi-dimensional diversity indices (species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and Pielou evenness) with aboveground and belowground plant biomass in the alpine grasslands of the QTP by linear mixed model (LMM). We assessed the plant diversity and biomass of alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and alpine desert steppe from 5 sites across the vast landscape of the QTP by using 6 randomly placed plots in each site and 27 replicated quadrats in each plot. The species richness of the studied alpine grasslands ranged from 2 to 35, aboveground plant dry biomass ranged from 17 to 838 gm(-2), and belowground plant dry biomass ranged from 398 to 3945 gm(-2). The species richness and Shannon-Wiener indices were positively correlated with aboveground plant biomass and belowground plant biomass at the landscape scale, whereas the Pielou evenness index was negatively correlated with aboveground plant biomass and belowground plant biomass at the landscape scale. Less than 20% sites showed significant relationships between plant diversity indices and plant biomass at site scale. Plant biomass partitioning between the root and shoot was not correlated with the species richness, Shannon-Wiener and Pielou evenness indices at all scales. The plant diversity-biomass relationships of the alpine grassland ecosystems in the QTP depend on both the type (or dimension) of the biodiversity index and the spatial scale of sampling. Thus, the design and implementation of plant diversity conservation should consider different dimensions of plant diversity. It is not enough to increase species richness only in the process of grassland restoration and conservation, but also to reduce species evenness so as to promote productivity more fully, for example, in planting artificial grassland.

AB Global road network has expanded at an unprecedented rate in the last century, and is needed for economic and social growth. However, the road networks through forest landscapes open it up for further exploitation and act as permanent scars on these fragile ecosystems. This has driven greater interest in studying ecological impacts of the road networks on forest cover dynamics. Our study assessed changes in forest canopy density (FCD) using satellite-based indices, and forest fragmentation using Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) for 2000 and 2016 in the Central Himalaya. The analysis reports reduction in areas with high FCD from 85% of geographical area in 2000 to 76% in 2016. Specific to road sites, maximum change has taken place owing to expansion of national highway (NH) 72 from two-lane in 2000 to four-lane in 2016. MSPA results also support this argument as forest fragmentation has substantially increased along the road transects, especially NHs and metalled roads. The study asserts that metalled forest roads at lower elevations and closer to the forest periphery have greater detrimental effects on surrounding ecosystems than unmetalled forest roads. Reason being continuous disturbance due to heavy traffic load, ease of accessibility to forest and added anthropogenic disturbances near the periphery. As ecological impacts of road network have not been mainstreamed into research and policy making in Himalaya, the findings from this study shall improve knowledge on the current status and potential future pathways of sustainable infrastructure development in Himalaya in particular and mountains around the globe in general.

AB Chemical and biological functioning of artificial wetlands and lakes in alluvial plains is investigated based on the example of small artificial ponds located within dike fields along the Rhone River (France). The objective is to identify the diversity of metabolism in these artificial aquatic ecosystems and to propose a functional classification linked to the connectivity with the river. A comprehensive characterization of chemical and biological parameters in six shallow ponds was conducted, along with 4-month continuous monitoring of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration, both in the sub-surface and at depth. Metabolism intensity is quantified using the diel oxygen method. Multivariate analysis of chemical and biological characteristics is performed to identify the functional heterogeneity between the ponds, which is shown to be consistent with the intensity of primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). Some ponds are permanently connected to the river, like backwater, and are very turbid, because of suspended matter and the presence of phytoplankton. The oxygenation is limited to the surface layer with anoxia rapidly building up at the bottom due to an intense ER. Ponds that are rarely connected become eutrophic with large concentration of phytoplankton and large GPP and ER values. Anoxia and even denitrification occur close to the bottom sediment. Finally, in the ponds with intermediate degree of connection with the river, macrophytes grow in clear water with limited amount of phytoplankton, resulting in a gradient of GPP and ER values, controlled by nutrient availability. Rehabilitation of various connection patterns with the river is thus crucial to maintain a functional diversity in large river alluvial plains.

AB Freshwater species are adapted to and depend on various discharge conditions, such as 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). Knowing how these indicators will be altered under climate change is essential for predicting species response and to develop mitigation concepts. The simulation of IHA under climate change is subject to considerable uncertainties which should be considered to obtain credible and robust predictions. Therefore, we investigated the major uncertainties inherent in climate change data and processing: general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) choice, representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario, bias correction (BC) method, all within three mesoscale catchments in the European ecoregions: Central Plains, Central Highlands, and Alpine. Highest uncertainties were caused by the GCM and RCM choice, followed by the type of BC and the RCP. For the prediction, we reduced these uncertainties tailored to the ideal depiction of the IHA in each ecoregion. Together with a significance test, this enabled a robust depiction of the change in IHA for two future time periods. We found diverging changes within the ecoregions, caused by the complex interaction between precipitation, temperature and the governing catchment hydrological processes. The results provide an important basis for further impact research, especially for ecological freshwater studies.

AB Since drought is a natural disaster that causes significant loss to society and the agrarian economy, detection of drought period is very important for different drought management strategies involving irrigation scheduling, canal scheduling, and reservoir operation. For estimation of drought, although there are a number of drought indices, viz., univariate Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and Soil Moisture Stress Index (SSI) existing in the literature, they are not fully effective for early warning and onset detection of drought events due to the scarce-knowledge of interdependency among the drought-causing factors. As an indirect method, the hydrological Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) alone cannot be used for drought assessment. Hence, in this study, the SWAT is coupled with the multivariate copulas to effectively predict the drought years. The developed approach is tested in the Kangsabati River basin (12,014 km(2)) having about 48% of the area under paddy land use. The SWAT model is set up for the study area at daily time-scale with the Nash-Sutcliffe Criterion (E-NS) of 0.64 and R-2 of 0.64 during the calibration period. The SPI and Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) are calculated for all the selected areas at four time-scales of 3-months, 6-months, 9-months and 12-months using the time series data from 1982-2010. The correlation analysis between SPI and SRI showed that the onset time for hydrological drought after the occurence of meteorological drought is three months. For identification of drought years, the multivariate distribution of SPI and SSI was constructed using the members of Archimedean copula family. Out of all the members of the copula family, Frank copula gave the best joint probability distribution function. The newly developed Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI) is capable of determining drought years with very good accuracy. Hence, the results reveal that the developed SWAT-Copula based approach has the potential to be implemented in data-scarce regions for effective drought monitoring with the minimum observed inputs.

AB A better understanding of gross nitrogen (N) transformation rates in agroforestry systems is crucial for testing the land use management effects on soil N retention. In this study, gross N transformation rates in forest and adjacent agricultural soils in two agroforestry systems, hedgerow and shelterbelt, located near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada were investigated using the N-15 labeled technique and a numerical model, FLUAZ. Gross N mineralization rates in the forested land use were higher than that in the agricultural land use for hedgerow and shelterbelt agroforestry system, and the pattern was the same for gross N immobilization rates. However, gross nitrification rates in the forested land use were lower than that in the agricultural land use for both agroforestry systems. The ratios of gross nitrification to ammonium immobilization rates and the ratios of gross N mineralization to immobilization rates in the agricultural land use were higher than that in the forested land use irrespective of the type of agroforestry system studied. Our study suggested that the agricultural land use had a lower potential to conserve N, posing a higher risk of N loss, whereas mineralization and immobilization processes were tightly coupled in the forested land use, leaving less N available for nitrification and subsequent N loss to the environment.

AB This paper is a review of research and experiences related to the application of constructed wetland systems (CWs) in southeastern Poland in 1992-2016. On the basis of literature data, a comparison between pollutant removal efficiencies of one-stage and hybrid CWs was made. Some problems regarding the operation of these treatment plants were also presented. Data from various facilities indicate that one-stage CWs with horizontal or vertical flow were characterised by a quite high (80-89%) efficiency of removal of BOD5, COD and total suspended solids, but were less efficient in removing of biogenic compounds nitrogen and phosphorus - respectively 59 and 66%. Significantly higher removal efficiencies for the basic pollutants (above 92%) were observed in hybrid CWs with a VF-HF bed configuration. Those facilities removed ca. 65% of total nitrogen and 89% of total phosphorus. A statistical analysis revealed that hybrid VF-HF type CWs were characterised by a very high, about 99%, operation reliability. Lower reliabilities were achieved by one-stage CWs, especially those with a VF bed. Twenty five years of research on and experiences in the application of CWs in southeastern Poland indicate that one-stage CWs can be used on a larger scale in Polish conditions in rural areas with a scattered housing structure. Hybrid systems, on the other hand, can be applied successfully in recreational centres or in protected areas, especially in national parks, where a high pollutant removal efficiency is required. It has been shown that the use of hybrid CWs is consistent with the idea of sustainable development.

AB The critical situation of domestic wastewater treatment in the rural areas of Brazil stimulates the development or improvement of on-site systems using cheap and sustainable materials that can be applied in small and isolated communities. Although this is an important theme, few real scale systems have been studied. This study investigated a full-scale on-site domestic wastewater treatment system composed of a septic tank, an anaerobic filter filled with green coconut husks (Cocos nucifera) and an intermittent sand filter. The experiment was conducted in a rural area located in the city of Campinas (Brazil) and the system was built to serve a small community. The quality of the effluent generated by this combination is in accordance with Brazilian and European legislation and even allows for its reuse in agricultural activities. The results also demonstrate the feasibility of using coconut husks in anaerobic filters, providing a new and more sustainable destination for this material, which is normally treated as solid waste. The combination was shown to be a viable technology for small communities.

AB Spatial pattern analysis is useful to elucidate the type and importance of the ecological processes in forest ecosystem. To better understand the dynamics of the natural secondary forest ecosystem and to provide information regarding the interactions between arbors and shrubs, the spatial patterns of dominant species in a natural secondary forest was examined in this paper. We developed a 2 ha secondary forest plot by mapping the location of all woody plants (diameter at breast height >= 1 cm). Univariate and bivariate Ripley's L(r) functions were utilized to evaluate the spatial patterns and association of the three dominant plants (P. davidiana, B. platyphylla and C. mandshurica). It was found that aggregated distribution was the main pattern in the dominant populations of the total and size-specific individuals of arbors at most scale. The degree of aggregation gradually decreased with size in B. platyphylla due to self-thinning while increased in P. davidiana which may attribute to the effects of logging for large-and medium-size woods in 1940s or 50s. In associations of intra-/interspecies pairs, positive association was the majority of intraspecies, whereas negative association was the domination in interspecies. Remarkable, mutual independence dominated in C. mandshurica vs. size-specific B. platyphylla pairs at most scales, and positive association emerged at greater than 8m scales in C. mandshurica vs. size-specific B. platyphylla-large, may contribute to different niche occupying that generated less competitions for resources, even the large ones could provide preferable shelter for shrubs.

AB Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are an emerging surface water treatment practice for reducing nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in a variety of waste streams. FTWs consist of floating rafts which support wetland plants allowing the plant roots to be submerged below the water surface similar to hydroponic systems. N and P removal is achieved through direct plant uptake and flocculation or sedimentation facilitated by biofilms adhering to plant roots. While research has documented FTW performance for a variety of waste streams, little information is available on runoff from commercial nurseries. Nursery runoff occurs frequently, from storm and irrigation events, and can potentially contain elevated concentrations of total N (TN) and total P (TP) due to crop fertilization and frequent irrigation. Nursery runoff is often captured in large ponds known as tailwater recovery basins (TRBs) for reuse. We assessed the effectiveness of FTWs for treating nursery runoff in TRBs over a 7-day hydraulic retention time across a 19-week growing season using two supplied nutrient concentrations and four treatments with four replicates in a randomized complete block mesocosm experiment. The high nutrient concentration averaged 17.1 mg.L-1 TN and 2.61 mg.L-1 TP and low nutrient concentration averaged 5.22 mg.L-1 TN and 0.52 mg.L-1 TP. Treatments included: 1) Pontederia cordata, 2) Juncus effusus, 3) a raft with no plants, and 4) no raft (open-water). Pontederia cordata removed 90% and 92% of TP and 84% and 89% TN, depending on initial loading; performing better than the other planted and non-planted treatments. Juncus effusus performed better than the mat-only control treatments for TP and TN removal across nutrient concentrations tested, but performed similarly to the open water control when nutrient load was evaluated. Nutrient uptake by Pontederia cordata averaged 0.026 g.m(-2).d(-1) N and 0.0075 g.m(-2).d(-1) P. The study demonstrated that FTWs can be very effective, but nutrient removal depends greatly upon plant species selection.

AB Behavioural guidance technologies that employ stimuli to attract or repel fish offer potential to enhance, or even replace, costly physical and mechanical screens traditionally used to protect fish at river infrastructure such as hydropower and water intakes. At these structures, eel can suffer high rates of damage and mortality if entrained in pumps or turbines, or impinged on screens intended to protect them. This study used acoustic telemetry to quantify the behavioural response of adult European eel (Anguilla anguilla) to infrasound (12 Hz) under field settings. Eel (n=50) were tracked after release immediately upstream of the forebay of a redundant hydropower facility. An infrasound deterrent located at the water intake either emitted continuously (ON) or was switched OFF. Treatment (ON/OFF) was alternated nightly over 10 consecutive nights with five eel released during a single trial conducted each night. Seventy eight percent of the 41 eel that moved downstream into the forebay passed the intake. Although the infrasound deterrent had no effect on passage rate, fine-scale differences in movement patterns were determined. When the infrasound was ON, eel trajectories were on average over twice as long with frequent erratic turns and milling behaviour (i.e. repeated lateral movements perpendicular to the principal flow direction), and they were less active within the intake channel close to the device. It is important to consider the influence of site characteristics, especially water velocities that dictate the potential for eel to respond to an acoustic field created. Infrasound deterrents that induce avoidance could be used to protect eel, either through enhancing the efficiency of physical screens or as part of multimodel behavioural guidance systems.

AB Green cooling towers, or thermal green-walls, recirculate hot water flowing through a living plant and porous material. Through convective and evaporative heat and mass transfer they can actively cool a building or an industrial heat waste. Thus they can provide an alternative cooling technology. Thermal green-walls use wetland plant species in highly constructed wetlands selected for their heat tolerance. In addition, they offer such co-benefits as carbon capture and control of local microclimates. Optimal heat rejection (HR) requires the plant rhizosphere to be completely inundated at temperatures much higher than the ambient air temperature, potentially inducing thermal physiological stress. To study the viability of specific plants within a HR system, we exposed three macrophytes, Iris versicolor, Scirpus cyperinus and Carex lurida, to hydroponic recirculating water at three different temperatures (25 degrees C, 35 degrees C, and 40 degrees C). We assessed the plant responses over a period of eight weeks by measuring photochemical efficiency, leaf temperature, stomatal conductance, G(s) and biomass output. Plant biomass was highest at 35 degrees C (particularly in I. versicolor), even higher than ambient water temperature at 25 degrees C. We observed a general homeothermic-like response in G(s) over a 5-week time period, but the response was species-specific with respect to temperature. Results suggests a possible leaf-level physiological acclimation mechanism as well as high maintenance of tissue moisture that allows macrophytes to tolerate hydro-thermal stress, and support their suitability to perform in HR systems at input temperature, T-win = 35 degrees C.

AB Green rooftops are installed in many climates worldwide to support urban ecosystem services. Across North America, green roofs often make use of the same limited set of plant species, but the effects of regional climates on the survival and growth of a core set of plant species has seldom been investigated. To identify the impact of climate on green roof plant performance, we installed an identical green roof system in three Canadian cities that experience different climate conditions: Calgary, Alberta; London, Ontario; and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The green roofs were monitored across three growing seasons for plant survival, plant height, and canopy density of three species grown in monoculture: Aquilegia canadensis, Sporobolus heterolepis, and Sedum spurium, and a mixture planting with all three species. Green roof vegetation canopy density, plant height and growth rates differed by city, plant species, substrate depth and planting type (monoculture or mixture treatment). Between sites, plant species exhibited different growth phenologies. Mixture treatments performed slightly better than monoculture plantings at each site in canopy density measures but were not significantly greater in plant height measures. The growth rate between years two and three was greatest for the mixture treatment, indicating greater potential for long term survival and performance of mixture plantings. The London, Ontario site, with a relatively moderate climate, supported the best green roof growth and performance compared to the cooler and drier Calgary and the rainier Halifax.

TI Canada goldenrod invasion cause significant shifts in the taxonomic
   diversity and community stability of plant communities in heterogeneous
   landscapes in urban ecosystems in East China

AB Invasive plant species (invaders hereafter) have led to larger shifts in the structure and functions of native ecosystems. Landscape heterogeneity in urban ecosystems can alter the invasion process mediated by the invaders. Thus, it is important to evaluate the effects of the invaders on the taxonomic diversity and stability of plant communities to better understand the mechanisms underlying successful plant invasion, especially in heterogeneous landscapes in urban ecosystems. This study aims to address the effects of the notorious invader Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.; goldenrod hereafter) on the taxonomic diversity and stability of plant communities by using a comparative study in heterogeneous landscapes in urban ecosystems in East China. Heterogeneous landscapes played a more obvious role in driving changed taxonomic diversity and stability of plant communities as compared to goldenrod invasion. The phenomenon may be most probably caused by the differences in environmental selection pressures in different types of landscape types. The taxonomic diversity (especially diversity and evenness) of plant communities were strongly correlated with the stability both in the uninvaded and invaded plant communities as well as the most types of urban ecosystems. Accordingly, the results of this study support the diversity hypothesis. There was a significantly negative correlation between the relative abundance of the most dominant species and the stability both in the uninvaded and invaded plant communities as well as in the all types of urban ecosystems. Thus, the results of this study did not support the mass ratio hypothesis. The relative abundance of goldenrod was not a primary driver in the stability of plant communities mainly due the fact that goldenrod invasion did not trigger noticeable impacts on the taxonomic diversity and stability of plant communities.

AB Habitats being restored in Belgian quarries are easily invaded by non-native plant species, which can hamper the germination and development of vegetation deemed to be of high conservation value. Substrates of terraces created when mining limestone quarries could be inhospitable to native plants. However, they can provide opportunities for establishing specific vegetation, such as dry calcareous grasslands. Applying suitable mining spoils could be a cost-effective way to provide growing substrate when restoring limestone terraces. We assessed the efficacy of using mining spoils, collected on-site, as a potential growing substrate (bedding material). We tested gravely limestone (product of on-site mining activities), limestone dust (by-product), and no addition (bare limestone bedrock) to determine which was best for favoring the growth of native, dry calcareous grassland species and discourage the growth of two non-native invasive species that commonly invade altered mining sites: Buddleja davidii Franch and Senecio inaequidens DC. In a field experiment (in two quarries), we studied short-term (2 y) growth response of native and invasive species after sowing three seed mixtures of native grassland species, varying in functional diversity (and one no-sowing control treatment), all treatments subjected to competitive pressure exerted by invasive species. Percent cover of native and invasive species, species abundance and reproductive characteristics of the invasive species were monitored during 2-y. Native grasslands coverage was low on all substrate types, demonstrating how slowly calcareous grasslands species establish in such harsh substrate conditions. However, type of substrate did show a significant relationship with plant abundance, with limestone dust being the most beneficial for native species establishment (coverage). Although limestone dust appeared to be the best option for restoring grassland species to limestone quarries (based on its low cost, wide availability, and potential to support native species), it was also likely to support the two invasive species. Functional diversity of the seed mixture had no consistent effect. Our study shows the importance of identifying the most appropriate substrate to both establish calcareous grasslands and resist invasive species. This approach provides insights into developing strategies to conserve biodiversity in industrial and agricultural landscapes with limestone quarries.

AB The immobilization of heavy metal Cu with rice husk biochar (RHB) and activated carbon (AC) addition were compared by in-situ remediation of sediment in this research. The RHB and AC were characterized using SEM, FTIR, XRD, XPS, Raman and BET surface area measurements. Heavy-metal contaminated sediments were immobilized by RHB and AC with the addition amount of 2%, 5% and 10% (w/w). The sequential extraction experiment demonstrated that the acid-soluble fractions of Cu were reduced by 48%-93% and 18%-31% with the treatment of AC and RHB, respectively. With the decrease of acid-soluble fractions of Cu, the results showed that the surface water concentration of Cu decreased by 32%-68% and 8%-60% with the treatment by AC and RHB, respectively. The Cu concentration of interstitial water decreased by 14.8%-63% and 11.1%-48.1% with the treatment by AC and RHB, respectively. Meanwhile, hierarchical cluster analysis which was used for the detection of microbial community was conducted. The results showed that the microbial community was destroyed in the sediment treatment with high amount of AC. However, new microbial community appeared in the sediment treatment with three addition amount of RHB. Based on the data analysis, AC was more effective than RHB on Cu immobilization in the sediment. Unfortunately, AC was more expensive than RHB and had potential negative effect on microbial community. By comparing these aspects comprehensively, our results suggest that the RHB would be a low-cost and environmentally friendly material for heavy-metal contaminated site remediation.

AB Drained riparian wetlands have been rewetted and restored in recent decades to remove nutrients, increase biodiversity, and mitigate soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Yet, few studies have documented the long-term effects of rewetting on complete greenhouse gas (GHG) balances including emissions of CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Here, we report the complete annual GHG balance of an extensively managed riparian wetland, dominated by creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), 12 years after rewetting. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was measured by transparent closed chambers, and fluxes were partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) for modelling and extrapolation to annual emissions based on photosynthetically active radiation, ratio vegetation index and temperature. Fluxes of CH4 and N2O were monitored with opaque chambers. Groundwater table (GWT) was close to soil surface for most of the growing period, whereas the site was inundated during winter. Biomass was cut in late summer (8.5 Mg dry weight ha(-1)), but left on-site according to current management in the area. Annual ER (1360 g CO2-Cm-2) exceeded GPP (-1140 g CO2-Cm-2), and the ecosystem was a net source of CO2 with NEE of 220 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1). However, fluxes of CH4 (53 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) dominated the annual GHG balance with 405 g CO2-C-eq m(-2) yr(-1) which contributed 60% to the total GHG balance. Fluxes of N2O were primarily found at times of changing GWT with annual emission of 0.7 g N2O m(-2) (50 g CO2-C-eq m(-2)) equal to 7% of the complete GHG balance. With proper management, rewetting and restoration of wetlands is expected to eventually resume the carbon sink function of natural wetlands, but this was not found in the present study as net fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 were positive. This was mainly attributed to on-site deposition of biomass which apparently stimulated both CO2 and CH4 emissions and partly reduced GPP by acting as a mulch layer. Future studies should focus on managements that increase CO2 uptake and biomass yield, and at the same time reduce CH4 emissions; such managements should avoid on-site deposition of aboveground biomass at rewetted sites.

AB Mowing is a common management technique employed in Europe and North America to manage seral wetland plant communities to: (a) prevent development to late succession, (b) minimise internal eutrophication and (c) conserve biodiversity. However, little is known about the effect mowing has on water quality, and the duration of any effects. Therefore, mowing treatments were applied in two abandoned fen plant communities: a Schoenus nigricans-Juncus subnodulosus (SN) community (hand-cutting) and a Cladio-Molinietum (CM) community (machine mowing). Mowing took place once in each community across three sites in North Wales, U.K. Effects on water chemistry were followed for two years post mowing.

AB Globally, peatlands are under threat from a range of land use related factors that have a significant impact on the provision of ecosystem services, such as biodiversity and carbon (C) sequestration/storage. In Ireland, approximately 84% of raised bogs (a priority habitat listed in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive) have been affected by peat extraction. While restoration implies the return of ecosystem services that were characteristic of the pre-disturbed ecosystem, achieving this goal is often a challenge in degraded peatlands as post-drainage conditions vary considerably between sites. Here, we present multi-year greenhouse gas (GHG) and vegetation dynamics data from two former raised bogs in Ireland that were drained and either industrially extracted (milled) or cut on the margins for domestic use and subsequently rewetted (with no further management). When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the rewetted nutrient poor domestic cutover peatland was a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) (-49 +/- 66 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and a source of methane (CH4) (19.7 +/- 5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), while the nutrient rich industrial cutaway was a net source of CO2 (0.66 +/- 168 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and CH4 (5.0 +/- 2.2 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). The rewetted domestic cutover site exhibited the expected range of micro-habitats and species composition found in natural (non-degraded) counterparts. In contrast, despite successful rewetting, the industrially extracted peatland did not exhibit typical raised bog flora. This study demonstrated that environmental and management variables can influence species composition and, therefore, the regeneration of species typical of natural sites, and has highlighted the climate benefits from rewetting degraded peatlands in terms of reduced GHG emissions. However, rewetting of degraded peatlands is a major challenge and in some cases reintroduction of bryophytes typical of natural raised bogs may be more difficult than the achievement of proper GHG emission savings.

The results showed that L. hexandra had a high extraction capacity for copper (Cu), and Cu concentration was found maximum in shoots (755.4 mg/kg), which is very close to the Cu-hyperaccumulators. Three successive harvests did not reduce the biomass and Cu level in shoots of L. hexandra (p > 0.05), indicating that sequential harvest was feasible for the increase of total biomass and Cu extraction amount. Fertilization could obviously increase the tissue dry weight, resulting in the total amount of extracted-Cu up to 52.3%. 3-Indole acetic acid (IAA) also significantly increased biomass, causing the efficiency of Cu phytoextraction up to 204.6%. These suggested that fertilization and IAA were effective for enhancing Cu phytoextraction by L. hexandra.

AB Fish responses to hydropeaking may range from sub-organismal adjustments to key life-event changes. It is currently difficult to quantify these responses and to assess the potential of artificial refuges accordingly. To address this problem, two experimental trials were conducted in an indoor flume. In the first, two hydropeaking events were tested in the presence of deflectors as flow refuges. In the second, the presence and absence of deflectors was tested for the same hydropeaking event. A multidisciplinary approach combined physiological and movement behaviour responses of Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) with hydrodynamic models. These were used as a complementary tool to explain the fish responses. In the first experiment, no evident physiological adjustments occurred. However, individual refuge use and swimming activity were higher in the single-step event where velocities above 0.6 m.s(-1) were observed. In the second experiment, the levels of glucose were the highest in the repeated single-step event with deflectors, whereas in their absence no visible changes were observed. The sequence of discharges affected the frequency of individual sprints and group drifts, particularly evident with deflectors. Additionally, the deflector use increased in the first peak in opposition to the second. Overall, the fish responses were indicative that the low velocity areas (< 0.1 m.s(-1)) existing behind the deflectors were favourable under hydropeaking conditions. However, the flow complexity resulting from the presence of deflectors impaired their ability to successfully find them. The integrated approach used in this study provided novel insight considering the responses of cyprinids to hydropeaking in the presence and absence of deflectors as a mitigation measure. This study emphasized the importance of characterizing the hydrodynamic conditions due to hydropeaking, particularly after including the artificial refuges.

AB Carbon (C) sequestration through accumulated plant biomass and storage in soils can potentially make wetland ecosystems net C sinks. Here, we collected GHG flux, plant biomass, and litter decomposition data from three distinct vegetation zones (Spartina alterniflora, Juncus roemerianus and Spartina patens) on a 7-year-old created brackish marsh in North Carolina, USA, and integrate these data into an overall C mass balance budget. The marsh fixed an average of 1.85 g Cm-2 day(-1) through plant photosynthesis. About 41-46% of the fixed C remained in plants, while 18.4% of the C was decomposed and released back to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4, and 8.6-13.2% of the decomposed C was stored as soil C. In all, this created marsh sequestered 28.7-44.7 Mg CO2 year(-1) across the 14 ha marsh. Because the brackish marsh emitted only small amounts of CH4 and N2O, the CO2 equivalent emission of the marsh was -0.87 to -0.56 g CO2-eq m(-2) day(-1), indicating the marsh has a net effect in reducing GHGs to the atmosphere and contributes to cooling. However, resultant CO2 credit (through the increment of soil C) would be worth only $30.76-$47.90 USD per hectare annually, or $431-$671 per year for the project, which, coupled with other enhanced ecosystem services, could provide landowners with some additional economic incentive for future creation projects. Nevertheless, C mass balance determinations and radiative cooling metrics showed promise in demonstrating the potential of a young created brackish marsh to act as a net carbon sink.

AB We introduce a facile fabrication process for ultrathin nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot (NGQD) layers on TiO2 nanoparticles in order to develop high-performance photocatalysts. NGQDs are grown either by graphitization of precursors or direct deposition of premade NGQDs. Photocatalytic performance is shown to be dependent on the thickness of NGQD layers and doping levels of C and N atoms on TiO2 surfaces. The nanocomposites shown to absorb a broad range of visible light and narrow the bandgap by 0.38 eV, resulting in the increased density of photoinduced eletron-hole pairs and efficient charge separation at the interface between the NGQDs and TiO2.

AB In the present study, nanotubular structure of cadmium selenide/titanium dioxide (CdSe/TiO2) was successfully prepared via chemical bath deposition (CBD) chemosynthesis method to improve photoelectrochemical activity under solar illumination. The results revealed that optimum CdSe dopants incorporated into TiO2 nanotubes played a crucial role in determining the photoelectrode performance in water splitting. It was found that synthesized CdSe/TiO2 nanotubes soaked at 30 min of CdSe precursor showed a maximum photocurrent density of 0.0016 A/cm(2) with improvement of about 10% than that of pure TiO2 nanotubes under solar illumination. The presence of optimum contents of CdSe dopants incorporated into TiO2 nanotubes could act as efficient mediators for trapping photo-induced electrons and reduce the recombination losses of charge carriers significantly.

AB Herein, a light and magnetism dual stimuli-responsive composite (SR-Fe3O4@AMEO@SP) was designed and synthesized, by assembling the light sensitive spiropyran (SP) with magnetism responsive SR-Fe3O4 particle. The resultant composite was characterized in detail and light/magnetism-triggered, structural and functional responses of it were evaluated systematically. Such solid-composite exerted sensitive to light stimulus properly attributing to the rough and uneven nature of SR-Fe3O4 surface, which provided a large interspace for SP conformational transformation. Based on these, SR-Fe3O4@AMEO@SP composites with dynamically and reversibly light/magnetism dual stimuli-responsive properties for potential application in catalysis and adsorption fields can be offered.

AB Electric field effect was investigated on 1-hydroxyacetone (HA) as a model compound of the acyclic form of saccharide moiety employing infrared electroabsorption spectroscopy. We examined the structural tautomerization of the hydroxyacetyl group of HA in detail by monitoring change in IR absorption intensity of the C=O stretching band in the range of 1650-1850 cm(-1). The observed changes in absorbance were analyzed by considering a change in the equilibrium of HA dimer, HA monomer, endiol, and enol forms, as well as the orientational polarization of each tautomer. Conversion from the HA dimer to the enol was detected.

AB Feedback from electrostatic potential and local ionization potential maps provides evidence that in the gas phase electrostatic interactions cause the activation barriers of guanine methylation by methane diazonium ion at the N7 site to increase upon addition of sugar and phosphate moieties, from 24.6 kcal/mol with the 6-31 + G* basis set to 29.87 kcal/mol with the 6-311 + G (2df, 2p) basis set at the DFT/B3LYP-D3 level of theory. Aqueous activation barriers strongly depend on the interaction of guanine with discrete number of water molecules and, in implicit water, they lie between 4.37 for free guanine to 5.39 kcal/mol for syn-dGMP(-)

AB According to recent studies on hydrophobic interactions, this work is devoted to investigate the structural origin of hydration force. As a solute is embedded into water, it mainly affects the structure of interfacial water, which is dependent on the geometric shape of the solute. From this study, hydration repulsive force is reasonably ascribed to the effects of surface roughness of solute on hydrophobic interactions. Hydration repulsive force is only expected as the size of surface roughness being less than Rc (critical radius). Additionally, this can be demonstrated by potential of mean force (PMF) calculated using molecular dynamics simulations.

AB An aliphatic SNS manganese pincer complex is computationally predicted as a promising catalyst for the hydrogenation of acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the total free energy barrier is 26.6 kcal/mol. Detailed reaction dynamics processes of two key steps, methanol assisted H-2 cleavage and hydrogenation of acetophenone, are analyzed by using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Our AIMD simulation results confirmed the proposed catalytic mechanism based on DFT calculations and revealed that the H-2 cleavage happens between 0.3 and 0.7 ps, while the hydride transfer from Mn to carbon happens at around 0.1 ps.

From these measurements the critical aggregation concentration (cac), critical micelle concentration (cmc), and degree of ionization (alpha) have been estimated. To understand the aggregation and interfacial behaviour of [C(4)mim][C12SO4] towards PVP and PEG, various thermodynamic and surface parameters have also been derived and discussed. The results exhibit that [C(4)mim][C12SO4] interacts strongly with PVP as compared to PEG.

AB Half-metallic, optical and band offsets properties of CrSb/KCl [0 0 1] interface have been calculated within the density functional theory (DFT) framework using FP-LAPW + lo method. We found that the CrSb/KCl [0 0 1] heterojunction retain perfect half-metallic character with 0.95 eV and 1.5 eV spin flip gap at spin down, using GGA and mbj approximations, respectively. The 0.03 meV electrostatic potential gap between CrSb film and KCl substrate demonstrate that the CrSb film is the good spin electron source for injection to the KCl film. The optical coefficients such as real and imaginary parts of dielectric function, reflection, refraction, extinction and energy loss function indices have been shown the good optical response in the visible area. The band offset parameters of CrSb/KCl [0 0 1] interface are of the type-I model with great amount of Phi(B) and chi potentials.

AB Four different Lewis acids that might participate in a tetrel bond with a nucleophile (SEt2Me+, NMe4+, SMe2, NMe3) are examined. The NMR chemical shifts of the methyl C and H atoms are calculated as the CH bond lengths are systematically stretched and contracted, in the absence of a base. The C shielding diminishes by roughly 2 ppm for a stretch of 0.01 angstrom, while that of H drops by only 0.3 ppm. The deshieldings caused purely by the bond length changes are far too small to account for the amounts that are computed when the nucleophile is actually present.

AB Multiply-charged anions are gaining attention owing to their high proton affinity. Recently, ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion has been prepared and shown to have the highest calculated proton affinity. Here, we have shown by calculations that replacement of organic benzene by its inorganic analogue, borazine, makes the species stronger base and its calculated proton affinity is the highest to date. Repulsive Coulomb barrier as well as kinetic stability with respect to 100-picoseconds time scale of this species may lead to its possible spectroscopic identification.

The obtained samples are characterized by using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, chronocoulometry, electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results confirmed that SC4 molecules are effectively loaded on the surface of CNT-TRGO composite compared to CNT and TRGO. The SC4-CNT-TRGO composite exhibits the highest supramolecular recognition of tyrosine and consequently excellent electrochemical response to the probe molecule compared to the other samples.

AB The series of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and MOx-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supports were synthesized by a micro-emulsion method. This method efficiently controlled the average particle size of supports below 6 nm. The supported NiO/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and NiO/MOx-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 catalysts were prepared by an incipient-wetness impregnation method. The OCS measurement and TPR result showed that adding Mg improved obviously the OSC of supports and the interaction between active components and supports. Furthermore, 8 wt%NiO/4wt%MgO-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 exhibited the highest catalytic performance. Its methane conversion reached up to 96% and enhanced 9% after 5 h compared to 8 wt%NiO/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. Especially, Its methane conversion was above 97% after 50 h continuous test at 800 degrees C.

AB A modified version of the D-CT index, based on total density analysis and evaluation of the particle-hole distance for a given excited state, which enables the consideration of only the contributions of a user-defined subset of atoms is presented. This index allows one to measure partial charge transfer in parts of molecular systems and can be used to analyze charge transfer in symmetric push-pull systems.
   This index (D-CT(P)) has been computed for three families of model symmetric compounds characterized by the presence of a single donor unit and several (2-4) acceptor moieties.

TI Geometry and bonding of small binary boron-aluminum clusters BnAln
   (n=1-7): Electron donation and interlocking aromaticity
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID STABILITY; SUPERATOMS; ANIONS; ATOMS
AB Binary BnAln clusters (n = 1-7) were investigated using both DFT/TPSSh and G4 calculations. B and Al atoms do not mix together but prefer to be assembled in two separated but interacting B-n and Al-n components. Large electron donation from Al to B atoms induces a donor-acceptor stabilization. Planar B3Al3 is a s aromatic compound. B4Al4 exhibits two aromatic electron flows that are interlocking in two perpendicular planes and circulate independently. The B7Al7 cluster appears as a double layer structure and this suggests formation of B-n and Al-n layers in larger clusters connected by electrostatic interactions.

AB As a widely used non-viral gene delivery vector, polyethyleneimine (PEI) was investigated at all-atom (AA) and coarse-grained (CG) levels. We used our recently published AA (CHARMM) force-field for PEI in extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, from which we extracted probability distributions for the distances, angles, and dihedrals formed by the residues. These were further employed to parametrize a CG (MARTINI) force field, which was fine-tuned by fitting the simulated CG structural and dynamical properties to their AA counterparts. The developed AA and CG force fields are suitable for realistic large-scale simulations of PEI-DNA condensation.

TI Exploring high temperature superconductivity mechanism from the
   conductivity equation obtained with the rate process theory and free
   volume concept
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB The conductivity equation developed on the basis of Eyring's rate process theory and free volume concept has been extended in this article to explore high temperature superconductivity. It is found that the high temperature superconductivity can only happen when the electrons have a fractional coordination number, in contrast to the low temperature superconductivity where electrons must form pair structures in most cases. The superconductivity transition temperatures will move to higher temperature regions if the electrons continue to have lower and lower fractional coordination numbers. For room temperature superconductors, electrons must have a very low fractional coordination number like 1/64, which is consistent with the physical picture of highly localized vortex core bound state theory. All materials can be potentially superconductors if the temperature is low enough, no matter that the conductivity initially increases or decreases with the decrease of temperature. Our findings may shed light on how high temperature superconductivity works and provide clues on how to design high temperature superconductors.

AB We performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study interaction mechanisms of binary mixture systems of explosion products (H2O, CO2, and N-2) under high temperatures and pressures. It is found that there is no reactions in the CO2-N-2 system at extreme conditions. Only at 4000 K and 50 GPa, the mixture of H2O and N-2 began to decompose. The H2O and CO2 mixture can readily react and ultimately form different reaction products even at a relatively low temperature and pressure in contrast with the above two mixtures. The temperature plays a negative effect on the interaction in the H2O-CO2 system.

Comparing to above 675 K for the LaH3-MgH2 or KBH4, the dehydrogenation temperature can be decreased to 346 K for the composites (LaH3-MgH2-KBH4). The apparent activation energy of desorption process for the mixture is also greatly reduced. On the other hand, the products in the temperature programmed desorption process are also illustrated.

AB The photochemistry in adsorbed molecules is drastically different from that of gaseous ones. Seven channels of KrF laser-induced dissociation of chlorobenzene condensed on silica have been found using mass spectrometry. They include the multiple photon detachment of H and Cl atoms and the opening of the aromatic ring. A general approach is proposed for adlayer photolysis based on the excitation of molecules into repulsive electronic states when bonds are stretched. It consists of the multiphoton transition of molecules into high vibrational levels in the vibronic continuum, bond elongation, and stimulated photoemission. Secondary processes in desorbed fragments were also studied.

Crystallized Sn1- xFexO2 films were obtained at the deposition temperature above 570 degrees C, which exhibited remarkable room-temperature ferromagnetism and magnetic anisotropy. The Sn1- xFexO2 films have largest saturation magnetic moment of 0.255 mu(B)/Fe at x= 0.033. In addition, Sn1- xFexO2 nanostructure arrays were produced by glancing angle sputter deposition. The Sn1- xFexO2 nanostructure arrays possess larger atomic magnetic moment, which is 0.561 mu(B)/Fe (x= 0.059), compared with the flat films.

AB The photodissociation of methanol, which is an important radical source on interstellar ices, was studied using quantum chemistry calculations. Surface hopping simulations using the time-dependent density functional theory were performed, and the potential energy curves of the low-lying excited states were analyzed using the second-order multireference perturbation theory to reveal the reaction mechanism in the gas phase. We showed that the generation of CH3O would more frequently occur than that of CH2OH on the S-1 state in contrast to the ground state. We also discuss why the ratio of CH3O and CH2OH differs between the gas and solid phases.

AB Calcium phosphates are suggested as a CO2 adsorbent via pressure swing adsorption. Amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) (composed of hydroxyapatite and beta-tricalcium phosphate) were investigated for the capture/immobilization of the gas. A fluidized bed was set up to assess the levels of CO2 adsorption by ACP and BCP. A gaseous mixture was synthesized, mimicking the conditions for possible industrial use. The results show a significant reduction in CO2 concentrations. Using DFT calculations, we show that CO2 adsorption increases the stability by reducing the surface energy. The energies involved and preferential adsorption sites were also theoretically predicted.

AB Few-layered graphene oxide is covalently functionalized with (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane and incorporated into an organosiloxane matrix using a sol-gel technique. Nonlinear optical and optical limiting properties of functionalized few layered graphene oxide embedded in an organosiloxane matrix (f-GO/sol) are studied in the nanosecond regime at 527 nm. In a Z-scan study, f-GO/sol samples exhibit superior nonlinear optical and optical limiting responses in comparison to their graphene oxide precursor due to increased covalent crosslinking of graphene oxide and organosiloxane molecules. These significant improvements are attributed to the combined mechanisms of nonlinear absorption and nonlinear scattering, due to graphene-silica nanostructures and thermally-generated microplasmas.

AB In this letter, tungsten oxide(WO3)/TiO2 core-shell nanowires were prepared by depositing a layer of TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of WO3 nanowires via a pulse laser deposition method. These TiO2 nanoparticles are qusi-aligned wire-like structure on the surface of WO3 nanowires. The number of laser pulses during the deposition adjusts the TiO2 thickness. When used as photocatalyst, these core-shell nanowires have photocatalytic activity in the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB). The photo-induced electron-hole separation effect between WO3 and TiO2 contributes to the improvement of the photocatalystic activity. This makes these nanowire arrays having good potential in wastewater treatment.

AB Photoinduced reversible intramolecular hydrogen-atom migration between 9H-fluorene and 1H-fluorene isolated in an Ar matrix is found by FTIR spectroscopy with an aid of DFT calculation. The forward isomerization from 9H-fluorene to 1H-fluorene occurs upon UV irradiation (lambda >= 295 nm), while the backward isomerization occurs lambda >= 320 nm light irradiation. The less stable isomer, 1H-fluorene, is identified by comparison of the measured IR spectrum with the corresponding simulated spectral pattern obtained at the B3LYP/6-31 + + G(d, p) level. In addition, an IR spectrum of 9H-fluorene in the T-1 state is measured during UV irradiation (lambda >= 275 nm).

AB The stearic acid (SA) - hexanamide (HA) binary mixtures were prepared, and the phase diagram and Tammann plot were constructed. The differential scanning calorimetry results indicated that a eutectic composition formed by 46.2 mol% SA and 53.8 mol% HA melted at the temperature of 331.15 K with a latent heat of 176.62 J.g (-1). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results revealed that SA and HA were just physical mixture. The results of thermogravimetric analysis and 100 thermal cycles test respectively manifested that eutectic mixture had good thermal stability and reliability. Therefore, eutectic mixture is promising for thermal energy storage application.

AB We employed PBE and BLYP semi-local functionals and the van der Waals density functional of Dion et al. (2004) (vdW-DF) to investigate structural properties of liquid acetonitrile and methanol. Among those functionals the vdW-DF is the only one that correctly predicts energy minima in inter-molecular interactions between acetonitrile molecules. We found that van der Waals interactions have a negligible effect on H-bonds in methanol chains. However, it significantly increases chain packing resulting in a more dense liquid in comparison to the other two functionals. The overall trend is that the vdW-DF tends to overestimate density and bulk modulus, meanwhile the semi-local functionals tend to underestimate density. Thus, van der Waals interactions play an important role in the properties of liquids in which much stronger dipole-dipole interactions are present.

AB The objective of this study is to evaluate vibrational energy propagation of a C-H stretching signal on unsaturated organic molecules and the effect of saturation in a specific site of those molecules using ab-initio molecular dynamic relaxation simulations. The results show that the inclusion of saturation at a specific site at the double bonded organic chain blockade the protrusion of C-H stretching vibrational energy at this site. As the saturation involves the change from double to single bonding regime, the effect is possibly originated by the loss of electron resonance at this specific site.

AB We performed replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations for self-assembly of an M12L24 spherical complex that consists of 12 palladium ions (M) and 24 bent ligands (L). We found two metal-ligand frameworks with polyhedral structure were mainly observed with almost equal probability. One of the two frameworks, which has the lowest potential energy, has the same symmetry, T-d, as the framework determined by the X-ray crystallographic analysis. The other framework, which has a slightly higher probability, has a different symmetry, C-3v. The latter framework is less likely to be observed experimentally than the former because of the difficulty in crystallization.

AB A study of the temperature dependence of the gas-phase reactions of OH radicals and Cl atoms with a series of hydrofluroolefins: 2-fluoropropene (CH3CF=CH2), hexafluoroisobutylene ((CF3)(2)C=CH2) and (E/Z)-1,2,3,3,3pentafluoropropene ((E/Z)-CF3CF=CHF) has been performed. The relative-rate technique was used to determine rate coefficients over the temperature range 287-313 K.
   This work constitutes the first temperature dependence study of OH radicals and Cl atoms with 2-fluoropropene and (E/Z)-1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropene and for the reaction of Cl with hexafluoroisobutylene. Atmospheric implications are discussed with particular reference to the rate coefficients obtained as a function of the temperature.

AB To investigate the surface structures of forsterite in crystalline and glassy states, we performed molecular dynamics calculations. The result shows that a low-density layer exists in the surface. The amplitude of the thermal vibrations of atoms in the surface layer is higher than that of the internal parts due to a low coordination number. The enhanced thermal vibrations of atoms in the surface layer cause a surface melting. The surface effects have important implications for forsterite states in meteorites and interstellar space.

AB Core-shell structured TiO2@In2O3 with high visible-light photocatalytic activity have been successfully fabricated by solvothermal method. The as-obtained products were characterized by field transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS). Structural characterizations demonstrated that the In2O3 layers were comprised of nanocrystallites ca. 14 nm in size and displayed rough surfaces. The UV-vis DRS data showed that In2O3 greatly expanded the visible light absorption band edge of TiO2. The results revealed that the obtained TiO2@In2O3 with core-shell structure showed enhancement of the visible-light photocatalytic activity to degrade methyl orange (MO) comparing with the pure TiO2 and In2O3 products.

AB The N2I2(E0(g)(+)) van der Waals complexes have been observed and studied for the first time. Analysis of the luminescence excitation spectra as well as luminescence spectra themselves in the spectral ranges, where the I-2(D0(u)(+) -> X0(g)(+), beta 1(g) -> A1(u) and D'2(g) -> A'2(u)) transitions can occur, has been carried out. Branching ratios of the iodine molecule state formation and vibronic level population have been determined. Ab initio calculations of the N2I2(X0(g)(+)) complex ground state at complete basis set limit are performed. It is shown that it has two stable, parallel and linear, isomers separated by an energy barrier. The parallel isomer is observed in our experiments. Binding energies of the N2I2(X0(g)(+),v(X) = 0,n(X) = 0,B0(u)(+),v(B) = 19,n(B) = 0) as well as the some spectroscopic parameters of the N2I2(E,v(E) = 0, 3) complexes have been also estimated.

AB We here precisely analyzed the electronic structures during the oxygen-oxygen (O-O) bond formation of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II (PSII) based on the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. Changes in the spin density and the chemical indices derived from the natural orbitals suggested that the O-(5)-O-(6) bond formation proceeds with a concerted bond breaking of the Mn-4-O-(5) coupled with the through-bond one-electron transfer from the O-(6) site to the Mn-4 site (Mn-4(IV) -> Mn-4(III)). This mechanism can be best described as a Concerted Bond Switching (CBS) mechanism, which is a nonradical reaction of the O-(5)-O-(6) bond formation.

AB Even-sampling methods have allowed for the evaluation of the density of states, providing access to all thermodynamic properties at once. However, these methods become highly intensive for multicomponent systems. We develop a combined Expanded Wang-Landau-Machine Learning (EWL-ML) approach to predict efficiently and accurately the thermodynamics of mixtures. We show that only a fraction of the EWL results is necessary to train a neural network and provide results in very good agreement with experiments. The resulting speed-up is expected to considerably increase the range and complexity of systems that can be studied with even-sampling methods.

AB A new method was developed for preparing monodisperse Fe3O4@SiO2 magnetic core-shell nanoparticles via three steps. The obtained nanoparticles exhibit high saturation magnetization, good surface topography and dispersion as characterized by FTIR, SEM and VSM. The experimental results of hydrochloric acid treatment show that the obtained nanoparticles have excellent acid resistance and stable and compact silicon coating. The magnetic core-shell nanoparticles were further tested for purification of plasmid DNA from E. coli DH5a cells. The result of purification leaded to better adsorption, elution and purity results in comparison with isolated commercial extraction kit.

AB Despite the importance of DNA/RNA hybrids, a mesoscopic approach is still missing. We developed a mesoscopic model for DNA/RNA hybrids and obtained the complete parametrization from published melting temperatures. The new parameters show very clearly the reduced strength of the hydrogen bond of dArU base pairs, resulting in a weakened stabilization of the double helix and a strong stability dependence on deoxypyrimidine content. The stacking parameters show no correlation to B-DNA, however we obtain a moderate correlation to A-RNA. We discuss some example sequences with variable deoxypyrimidine contents and for polipurine tracts (PPT).

AB A mathematical model of transport and kinetics of substrate, redox-mediator in surface deposited film is discussed. The model is based on the system of non-linear reaction diffusion equations containing a nonlinear term related to the Michaelis-Menten kinetic of the enzymatic reaction. The non-linear reaction diffusion equations in amperometric biosensors are solved using New Homotopy perturbation method. The effect of various parameters on current density is discussed. Numerical simulation for concentration profile and flux was carried out and compared with the analytical results. A satisfactory agreement is noted. A graphical procedure for estimating the kinetic parameters and sensitive analysis is suggested.

AB In this study, a novel form of three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon allotropes (superprismane) was predicted and its thermal, mechanical as well as electronic properties were evaluated by means of first-principle density functional theory based calculations. Calculated cohesive energy (E-coh), bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (E), Vickers hardness (H-upsilon) and phonon band dispersions at zero pressure reveal the excellent thermodynamical and mechanical stability of superprismane. Results show that, superprismane is superhard, ductile and semiconducting in nature. Further, superprismane comprises of low effective mass fermions and serves as potential candidate in blue to ultraviolet optoelectronic applications.

AB Extensive attention has been focused on the development of rare-earth-free phosphors, due to their low cost, good absorption and emission properties. However, the yellow light emitted phosphors with good quantum yield and thermal stability are still urgent Herein, we successfully prepare the single-phase Zn(3)V(2)O(8 )yellow phosphor through a solid state reaction method. The as-prepared phosphors present a broad absorption band in UV/NUV region, and exhibit an intense broadband emission spectrum under the NUV light excitation at 365 nm. The Zn3V2O8 phosphors also show excellent luminescence performance including strong emission intensity, long PL lifetime, high quantum yield, and good thermal stability. Moreover, this sample obtains a CIE coordinate of (0.364, 0.486) in the yellow light region. Therefore, the Zn3V2O8 phosphors can be considered as a novel yellow light source for w-LED devices.

AB NaCa2Si3O8(OH)nanowires with diameters of 100-150 nm and lengths up to several tens of micrometers have been successfully prepared on a large scale via a one-step hydrothermal method. The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)-coated NaCa2Si3O8(OH) nanowires have also been prepared via a simple dip-and-dry technique. The electrochemical performances of the NaCa2Si3O8(OH) and NaCa2Si3O8(OH)/PEDOT:PSS nanowires were investigated. Compared with pure NaCa2Si3O8(OH) nanowires, the NaCa2Si3O8(OH)/PEDOT:PSS composite nanowires exhibit improved electrochemical properties of higher discharge/charge capacity and better cycling reversibility. This is the first time that NaCa2Si3O8(OH) nanostructures were used as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries, and the present work will greatly expand the application fields of NaCa2Si3O8(OH).

AB Reversible crystal state structural phase transitions molecular materials without metal have been received increasing interest recently. Here we successfully synthesized a novel ternary neutral co-crystallized organic adduct hexamethylenetetramine.1-adamantane carboxylic acid.chloroform, 1, which accompanies with an interesting reversible phase transition close to the zero temperature (263 K). We confirmed this reversible phase transition by its switchable thermal dielectric behaviors and unit cell constants anomalies around the phase transition temperature (T-c). X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis above (1-RTP) and below (1-LTP) T-c suggests that the order-disorder motion from the adamantane ring in 1-adamantane carboxylic acid triggered the reversible phase transition.

AB The ethanolic extract of Syzygium cumini fruits was characterized and evaluated in the photogeneration of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) under visible light radiation. This process was studied from a theoretical approach by the survey of the generated electronic excited states, after photoexcitation of the most abundant anthocyanin of the extract, i.e. delphinidin-3,5-diglucoside. It was determinated that the adiabatic energy of the optimized T-1(pi(H-1) -> pi(L)*) state was 1.55 eV and that the overall energy transfer releases similar to 0.58 eV in an exothermic process. Therefore, this state is the responsible of promoting electron transfer reactions and subsequent formation of O-1(2) through illumination.

AB We calculate the electronic, thermal and mechanical properties of antimonene with different oxygen compositions (Sb, 25b-O and 25b-2O). Results show that the band gaps gradually decrease with the increase of the oxidation degree. We also study the lattice thermal conductivities of the three materials and find that the oxidation would greatly reduce the lattice thermal conductivity k of antimonene which is due to the decline of corresponding phonon lifetime. In addition, oxidation reduces the stiffness of antimonene. Our work provides a new perspective for the adjustment of thermal transport which will facilitate the design of thermal materials.

AB The study of two new acylthiourea derivatives (Ar-CO-NH-CS-NH-R) are focused on the bonding interactions supported by X-ray, NMR, UV-Vis, Raman and IR spectroscopy, and NBO, AIM and Hirshfeld surface analysis. The RAHB model is proposed to explain some structural properties. The molecules are stabilized by intra-molecular NH center dot center dot center dot O bonds arranged in the lattice as centre-symmetric dimers held by inter-molecular NH center dot center dot center dot S bonds. The dimers are linked to each other through NH center dot center dot center dot O bonds giving rise to a chain, ribbon-like structure in the network. In vitro bacterial growth inhibition, biofilm formation, biosensor and biofilm metabolic activity were tested considering the broad bioactivity of acylthioureas.

AB As one of non-covalent forces to stabilize protein, cation-pi interactions in collagen have been received much attention. Three chains of collagen form its characteristic secondary structure, triple helices. Based on a collagen heterotrimer, abc, a library containing 15 mutant peptides was built to characterize the stabilizing effects of 24 pairwise cation-pi interactions. The six stabilizing pairs, axial FK, YK, WK, RF, and RW, and lateral RF, have been identified, among which only axial RF frequently occurs in natural collagen sequences. This suggests that cation-pi interactions might not be optimized in natural collagen.

AB Two new carboxylated 1,3-indanedione sensitizers (MPhe-ind and BPhe-ind) were synthesized and their dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) performance were compared with the corresponding standard cyanoacetic acid sensitizers (MPhe-cn and BPhe-cn). The carboxylated 1,3-indanedione sensitizers have shown almost 100 nm enhanced absorption curves compared to the cyanoacetic acid dyes with an extended IPCE curve up to 800 nm. Despite greater absorption and electrochemical properties, the synthesized dyes showed moderate efficiencies (2.10% and 2.67%) than standard dyes. The low electron injection efficiency and recombination of carboxylated 1,3-indanedione might be responsible for low efficiency. Detailed investigation studies have been performed and complemented with the theoretical studies.

AB This study presents the fabrication and characterization of imine-functionalized Au nanoparticle (Au NP) film using Poly (ethyleneimine) (PEI) as a reducing and surface stabilizing reagent The PEI-capped Au NPs can be self-assembled at the water-hexane interface by adding alcohol containing alkanethiol. Furthermore, large-area film made from PEI and alkanethiol-capped Au NPs is produced on a glass substrate with varying interparticle distances that can be controlled by the alkyl chain lengths, ranging from C2 (ethanethiol), C4 (1-butnaethiol), C6 (1-hexanethiol), C8 (1-octanethiol), to C10 (1-decanethiol) at the water-hexane interface. These 2D films show strong collective localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) extinction bands that are tunable via near-field coupling of adjacent Au NPs. Pronounced chain-length-dependent red shifts of the SPR bands have been observed for the PEI-capped Au films. The obtained PEI-capped Au films exhibit distinct interparticle-distance-dependent SERS characteristics.

Our simulations proved that SiP2S monolayer indicates a good stability suggests its promise for experimental realization. Exploring the electronic properties shows that the proposed monolayer is an indirect semiconductor with a moderate band gap of about 1.19 eV calculated by HSE06 level of theory. Optical properties calculations show that this monolayer exhibits good absorption in low energy region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These results propose this new monolayer as a promising material for opto-electronic devices.

DE YbOH rotational spectrum
ID SPECTROSCOPY
AB The pure rotational spectrum of YbOH has been recorded and analyzed to produce fine and magnetic hyperfine parameters for the (X) over tilde (2)Sigma(+)(0, 0, 0) state. These parameters are compared with those determined from the optical study (Melville and Coxon, 2001) and with the values for YbF (Dickinson et al., 2001). The results support the existence of an unobserved perturbing state near the (A) over tilde (2)Pi(1/2) state, similar to that previously found in YbF. The precisely determining parameters lays the foundation for laser cooling YbOH, which will aid in the search for new physics beyond the standard model.

The physical properties of the aerogel were compared with those generated from zirconyl chloride (ZOC-ZrO2) and zirconyl nitrate (ZON-ZrO2). PAZ-ZrO2 aerogel has higher compressive strength (0.12-0.23 MPa) with lower density (0.12 +/- 0.005 g/cm(3)) as compared to ZOC-ZrO2 and ZON-ZrO2 aerogel, of which the mechanical strengths are in the range of 0.02-0.15 MPa and the density of 0.13-0.17 g/cm(3). After being treated at 1000 degrees C, the surface area (pore volume) of ZOC-ZrO2, ZON-ZrO2 and PAZ-ZrO2 aerogel are 210 m(2)/g (1.299 cm(3)/g), 223 m(2)/g (0.444 cm(3)/g) and 236 m(2)/g (1.568 cm(3)/g) respectively.

AB In the reported work, we have approached the interaction of the amino acids onto the antimonene (Sb) monolayer by using density functional theory (DFT). Here, we have considered glycine (Gly), glutamic (Glu), histidine (HIE/His) and phenylalanine (Phe) biomolecules for interaction. The structural, electronic and optical properties have been investigated to understand the behavior. The adsorption of the biomolecules on Sb monolayer show the physisorption process. The adsorption energy of the phenylalanine (Phe) biomolecules is the most favorable. The optical absorption peaks of systems come in the near visible region. The studies conclude that Sb monolayer is useful for the bio-integrated electronics based devices.

AB This paper reports magnetically recoverable Ag/Bi2Fe4O9 nanoparticles (BFO NPs) using as a photoexcited catalyst. The Ag NPs are uniformly distributed on the surface of BFO NPs. Compared to BFO NPs, the decomposition rate of methyl orange for Ag/BFO NPs under the visible-light is greatly enhanced due to the high surface plasmon resonance and electron conductivities of Ag NPs. Moreover, Ag/BFO NPs have a higher saturation magnetization than BFO NPs, which makes them can be collected easily under magnetic fields. Therefore, Ag/BFO NPs are potential recoverable visible-light-driven photocatalyst for environmental pollutants degradation.

AB In this work, we fabricated crystallite solid and porous TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) using a surfactant-templated aerosol process. Specifically, Brij-58 surfactant was employed as a template in TiO2 matrix. The porosity of TiO2 NPs was controlled by varying the amount of Brij-58. The effect of TiO2 porosity on the photocatalytic reactivity was systematically examined. As a result, the highly porous TiO2 NPs exhibited much better photocatalytic reactivity than the low porosity TiO2 NPs. This suggests that the particle size, crystallite structure, and specific surface area play an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic reactivity of the TiO2 NPs.

AB The structure of Co-doped Pd-n (n = 1-12) clusters is investigated using density functional theory (DFT) global optimization based on simulated annealing. The earlier putative global minimum of Pd12Co is now confirmed to be an icosahedron (I-h) with the Co atom in the center site, while unexpectedly cage structures are found for Pd-9(-)11 Co clusters, which are different than the icosahedral fragments. The results show, that doping with a Co atom increases the stability of Pd-n clusters and enhances their magnetic moment in the range of 1-3 mu(B). Ferromagnetic (FM) ordering between the Co atom and the Pd-n host are energetically favored.

AB Zn1-XPbXS (x = 0-0.4 in steps of 0.1) ternary semiconductor samples have been prepared by co-precipitation method. The structural, optical and electrical studies have been carried out on all these samples to understand the influence of Lead on these properties. X-ray diffractograms showed that all Zn1-XPbXS samples have polycrystalline nature with Hexagonal phase. The room temperature optical absorption studies revealed that energy gap decreases with increase of Pb in Zn1-XPbXS compounds. The temperature-dependent conductivity, measured in the range 300-4 K, led to understand that the conduction mechanisms at 60 K and 30 K are different. The activation energies evaluated at low (300-60 K) and very low temperature (60-30 K) regions are 38.03-32.58 meV and 17.99-13.56 meV respectively. Activation energy and conductivity of Zn1-XPbXS samples increase with the increase of Pb. The samples exhibited low freezing temperature points indicating the possibility of their use in low temperature device applications.

AB In this work, we report a new cyclic molecule, [8] Cyclo-1, 4-naphthylene ([8]-CN), that can act as an effective hole transport molecule. Based on First principle calculation we have quantified the reorganization energy of the compound to explore its efficiency as a hole transport molecule. Further, the molecule was functionalized with several electron donating (ED)/withdrawing(EW) groups to investigate the effect on the hole/electron transport property. We have found that the energy difference between indium tin oxide (ITO) work function and HOMO energy of ED group substituted ([8]-CN) are almost comparable while the situation is not suitable for EW group substituted [8]-CN.

AB Typically, with increasing sample temperature the rotational correlation time of the molecule decreases, leading to a decrease in the relative nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) enhancement In characterizing the (O-ethyl-L-cysteinato)-Ni(II) in the solution state, the measured NOE enhancement increases with increasing sample temperature. This unexpected change is explained via crosstalk between nuclear spin cross relaxation and an additional chemical exchange phenomenon between the amino protons of the molecule. The case study using a relaxation matrix approach, with both cross relaxation and chemical exchange, could be essential to understanding a metal complex with a bidentate amino acid derived ligands.

AB A facile way has been investigated to fabricate the phenolic-based carbon foam (PCF) modified with the unique three-dimensional structure of graphene oxide/SiO2 (GO/SiO2) hybrid nanomaterials which were obtained via in-situ preparation method. Results showed that the carbon foam sample modified by 1.5 wt% GO/SiO2 hybrid nanomaterial with a particle size of 80 nm had an electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) up to similar to 50 dB in X-band only at a thickness of 10 mm. This phenomenon may be ascribed to stable porous structure and nanoparticles assisting in attenuating the electromagnetic wave transmittance. The result enables their application in lightweight electromagnetic protection devices.

AB TiO2/Bi2WO6 composite photocatalysts prepared by a simple one-step hydrothermal method was added to a fluorocarbon resin coaling to improve the latter's antibacterial property. The sterilization performance of the TiO2/Bi2WO6-PEVE coaling was then detected via a photocatalytic sterilization experiment, a cycle sterilization experiment, and coaling interval sterilization. Results showed that the treated PEVE coaling achieves the best sterilization property under visible light when the mass ratio of TiO2 to Bi2WO6 is 7.5:100. After exposure to strong visible light for 1 h, nearly 80% of the bacteria attached to the coaling surface loses their activity. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-visible light spectrophotometry, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy were employed to determine the structural and morphological characteristics of the obtained products. The TiO2 nano/microspheres adhered to the surface of the Bi2WO6 nanosheets and increased the latter's specific surface area and electron transmission efficiency. A marine sterilization cycle experiment confirmed that the TiO2/Bi2WO6 composite photocatalyst can be added to PEVE coatings. This work provides a reference for the future application of photocatalytic coatings in marine environments.

AB This study investigated how to minimize carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from charcoal by impregnating with Pd-Sn/alumina and Cu-Mn/graphite. Samples were heated isothermally with continuous monitoring of residual CO using electrochemical and infra-red sensors. With 0.2 wt% Pd-Sn/alumina, 26.9% and 44.4% were recorded as lowest and highest residual CO. On the other hand, when 2 wt% Cu-Mn/graphite was used, 15.6%, and 25.3% were observed as lowest and highest residual CO. The activity of the catalysts decreased with temperature and increased with catalyst loading. This method could be used on briquettes, wood boiler chips and other solid carbonaceous materials to minimise CO emissions.

AB We present a universal efficient closed-form representation for the molar enthalpy of gaseous substances. The predicted molar enthalpy values show excellent agreements compared to the experimental data in a wide temperature range for the gases CO, HCl, and BF. The proposed model is away from the need of plenty of experimental spectroscopy data, and depends on only four molecular constants, for which the experimental values can be easily found in the literature.

AB Two types of pristine single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were used: one with > 70% carbon element (P70) and another with > 90% carbon element (P90). After fitting of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, it was found that impurity in P70 have around 26%, P70 sonicated have around 17%, and P90 have around 9%. The rubber nanocomposites were prepared by mixing room-temperature-vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber with pristine and sonicated SWCNTs. SEM shows that the filler particles were distributed uniformly throughout the rubber matrix. At 3 per hundred parts of rubber (phr), low resistance was obtained: similar to 94 kilo ohms (k Omega) (P70 SWCNTs), similar to 89 k Omega (sonicated P70 SWCNTs), and similar to 35 k Omega (P90 SWCNTs). The results show that the new model and modified Guth-Gold Smallwood model fit well with the experimental data. These improvements could be useful for next-generation devices such as actuators and energy harvesting.

By the precursor 2-chloro-p-xylene, we identified the two isomeric benzyl-type radicals, 2-chloro-p-xylyl and 3-chloro-p-xylyl radicals in the corona discharge. The vibronic emission spectrum of the chloro-p-xylyl radicals corresponded to the D-1 -> D-0 electronic transition and determined the electronic transition energy depending on the constitutional isomers.

AB A methodology of quantum dynamics based on interacting trajectories without reference to any wave function is applied to ultrashort laser ionization of a model hydrogen atom. The pulses are chosen to be so short that the relative phase between the carrier wave and the pulse envelope becomes important As main results we show that the trajectory-only approach is capable of correctly describing the large amplitude motion and energetics of the laser driven electron and of reproducing carrier-envelope effects onto the photoelectron spectra. It also provides an intuitive picture of the dynamical quantum processes involved.

AB In this study, we employ a type of polyoxotitanate (POT) compound with a unique structure that is composed of a metal-oxo core and functionalized by catechol ligands, and characterize its electrochemical and photoresponsive properties. We find that the POT functionalized by the catechol ligand acts as a photoresponsive single source to provide the photocurrent in aqueous electrolyte. The first principles calculation confirms the intramolecular ligand-to-metal charge transfer characters. Considering the stable photocurrent output generated by the POT in the aqueous condition, we anticipate potential applications of the catechol-functionalized POT in the optoelectronic devices that require water stability and aesthetic features.

AB In this study, first attempt has been made for theoretical designing of quinacridone (QA) dye and new QA-based compounds (QA-1 to QA-9) were proposed by installing auxiliary donors (dimethylvinyl, methoxy, and N,N-dimethylamine), donor (diphenylamine) and acceptors (cyanoacrylic acid, CN and NO2) segments into fixed pi-bridge QA. DFT and TDDFT calculations with B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) functional were used to shed light on the promising structure, charge transport and NLO properties. Introduction of auxiliary donors/donor and acceptor successfully modified the structure which led to superior NLO properties. An eye-catching NLO response was observed in all designed compounds. Interestingly, QA-9 exhibits appealingly large enhancement in NLO properties through ICT process with < alpha > and beta(tot) computed to be 716.02 (a.u) and 128082.15 (a.u) respectively. UV-Vis results indicates the QA-9 most red shifted among all studied compounds with lambda(max) = 489.02 nm. QA-1 to QA-9 showed narrow HOMO-LUMO energy gap as compared to QA which results in enhanced NLO response. NBO analysis confirms the formation of charge separation state in QA-1 to QA-9 due to successful migration of electrons from auxiliary donors/donor to acceptors via pi-bridge. The present research evokes the scientific interest regarding the development of QA based tempting NLO compounds that can be beneficial in modern hi-tech applications.

AB fac-[Re(CO)(3)(5-amine-1,10-phenanthroline)Cl or Br] (D1 and D2) were synthesized and characterized. D2 was obtained by al alternative method. The electrochemical reaction mechanisms of both D1 and D2 corresponded to EEC for reduction, and ECE for oxidation. Moreover, geometry, electronic, and luminescent properties were analyzed by relativistic DFT and TD-DFT calculations. We determined the lability of -Cl and -Br by a Morokuma-Ziegler analysis. We found that these compounds were less toxic than the ligand alone, and it depends on the cell model tested, where bacteria seem to be more susceptible than yeasts.

ID PHOTOCATALYTIC CONVERSION; CYCLOADDITIONS; REDUCTANT; EVOLUTION; H2O
AB The step-by-step hydrogen-terminated (SSHT) model is proposed as a model for the surfaces of metal oxides. Using this model, it is found that the vibronic coupling density (VCD) can be employed as a reactivity index for surface reactions. As an example, the regioselectivity of CO2 adsorption on the Ag-loaded Ga2O3 photo-catalyst surface is investigated based on VCD analysis. The cluster model constructed by the SSHT approach reasonably reflects the electronic structures of the Ga2O3 surface. The geometry of CO2 adsorbed on the Ag-loaded Ga2O3 cluster has a bent structure, which is favorable for its photocatalytic reduction to CO.

AB The potential energy surface (PES) of nitrobenzene isomers has been built by CCSD(T)/CBS methods. The geometries of isomers and transition states (TSs) are optimized at BHANDHLYP/6-311 + + G (d, p) level. Sixteen isomers and fifteen isomerization reactions of nitrobenzene were found. The rate constants for the isomerization reactions are calculated and compared according to different types of isomerization. The rate constants and activation energies (Ea) of all reactions are fitted using a qusi-Arrhenius equation. Branching ratios of the nitrobenzene isomerization reactions and the previously reported decomposition reactions are compared and the isomerization to C6H5O-NO followed by cleavage of O-NO dominates the decomposition of nitrobenzene at low temperature.

AB This work presents a new approach to preparation of Co/Mn-W3O8 nanoparticles via facile sonochemical route. Cobalt and manganese codoped tungsten oxide (W3O8) nanoparticles was studied as a photocatalyst for the removal of amaranth under solar light irradiation (lambda(max) 520 nm). The results indicated that the Co/Mn-W3O8 composite photocatalyst showed higher photocatalytic activity the single element doped and pure W3O8. Moreover, the stability of Co/Mn-W3O8 was tested using recycling experiments. It is suggested that the band gap energy difference between the Co/Mn-W3O8 and W3O8 accelerates the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, dominating the enhanced photocatalytic activity.

AB Many transport and rate processes in chemical, physical and biological systems, are controlled by the coupled chemical reaction-thermal diffusion process. Though many literatures, including the literatures of engineering of chemical reactions, discussed this coupled problem, but a unified rigorous theory and a unified method based on the chemical thermodynamics are lacked. In this paper we give a general thermodynamic theory including complete energy conservation equation, entropy equation, evolution equations of the heat conduction and the mass diffusion, especially the complete governing equations of these couple systems. The theory given here revises previous theories, clearly shows which factors should be considered and is valuable for the engineering of chemical reaction and other transport and rate processes.

Results show that the SO2 prefer to be absorbed at the top of Mo atom of MoS2. It is found that SO2 is strongly adsorbed on Al-MoS2 with considerable adsorption energy of -1 to -2.33 eV, however, the best adsorption position is the top of Mo atom of Al-MoS2, which the biggest E-a is -2.33 eV, the best charge is -0.343e and the shortest d is 1.763 angstrom. So these findings confirm that Al-MoS2 can be used to detect the presence of SO2 in the environment.

AB The paper reports a microwave assisted rapid synthesis of NiCo2O4@CNTs composite for the first time. Ultrafine NiCo2O4 nanoparticles approximately 6-10 nm in size dispersed uniformly along the CNTs walls are obtained. Interestingly, nanosheets structure is formed in the absence of CNTs. The distinctive morphology difference is attributed to the different nucleating and growing mechanisms. Due to the small NiCo2O4 nanoparticle size derived from microwave enabled fast synthesis and the unique 1D nanostructure, the NiCo2O4@CNTs composites materials exhibit more excellent lithium storage performance than that of counterparts.

AB SnO2/graphite oxide/g-C3N4 composite was synthesized by hydrothermally growing SnO2 nanosheets on graphite oxide/g-C3N4 using tin dichloride and mercapto acetic acid as tin source and structure-directing agent for SnO2 nanosheets, respectively. For comparison, SnO2/graphite oxide and SnO2/g-C3N4 composites were prepared with the same procedure except different supports. The obtained composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis and electrochemical properties. The results show that the SnO2/graphite oxide/g-C3N4 composite with the graphite oxide/g-C3N4 support enhanced reversible capacity and cycling performance for lithium storage.

AB Ag/carbon nanofibers and carbon nanofibers were prepared through electrospinning and high temperature carbonization. The catalyst was investigated through oxidation of styrene. The highest conversion of styrene respectively got to 98% and 70% when calcination temperature got to 1200 degrees C. CNFs (carbon nanofibers) have not only excellent catalytic performance but also relatively large accessible ion surface area to accommodate greater capacity and high graphitization degree to accelerate ion diffusion. CNFs exhibited excellent electrochemical performance for use as supercapacitors with high specific capacity of 271.1 F g(-1) at current density of 0.5 A g(-1), good rate capability and superior cycling stability over 3050 cycles.

AB Time dependent density functional theory is used to systematically examine the band gap variation of Li-substituted adamantanes upon fluorination. It is realized that the absorption wavelength of Li-Adamantane can be fine tuned within UV-Visible region by changing the degree of fluorination. The static and dynamic hyperpolarizabilities of fluorinated Li-Adamantane derivatives were computed using coupled perturbed Kohn Sham theory. In this article, we report Pockel, dc-Kerr, ESHG, degenerate four wave mixing coefficients and nonlinear refractive indices from the first and second order hyperpolarizability calculations. A high positive nonlinear refractive index and significant second harmonic generation efficiency at Nd:YAG Laser wavelength are observed in F3Li-Adm derivative.

The measured intensity ratios and eta(L3-Xi) (X = M, N, O i = 1, 4, 5) have been compared with theoretical and other experimental values.

AB Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to study the adsorption and dehydrogenation mechanism of CHX (x = 1-4) on the non-doped Cu(1 1 1) and M-Cu(1 1 1) surfaces (M = Pd, Pt, Rh and Ni). The adsorption intensity of CH2, CH and C species were higher on M-Cu(1 1 1) surface than non-doped Cu(1 1 1) surface. The minimum energy paths for CH4 sequential dehydrogenation were also studied, suggesting that CH4 desorption was more favorable than the dissociation due to the weakly physical adsorption. Interestingly, it was found that CHx dissociation was promoted in different degree on the M-Cu(1 1 1) surface both kinetically and thermodynamically, with the trend of Rh > Ni > Pt > Pd.

Here, we detailedly discussed the advantage and disadvantage of TEM and Raman fit method. Combined with FTIR results, we claified the chemical structures of the structural films and the bonded sites of doped H. The curved graphite structures included hexahydric carbon rings, and amorphous carbon (a-C) structures had rich olefinic groups and H. Finally, the differences among TEM, Raman, FTIR and H analysis in terms of the contents of curved graphite fragments were discussed.

AB Existence of salt ions significantly influences corrosion-inhibitor adsorption on metal surfaces and yields different inhibition efficiency. In this work, adopting molecular dynamics simulations, the effects of salt concentrations on inhibition performances were studied. Simulation results demonstrate that increasing salt concentration leads to initial decrease and subsequent increase of the inhibition efficiency. The competitive adsorption exists between protonated inhibitor and cations on negatively charged metal surface, and the electrostatic screening controlled by dissolved cations and anions are responsible for different adsorption behaviors. Our work provides a deep understanding of salt effect at the atomic level, and consummate the current inhibition theory.

AB We compute the rovibrational eigenstates of the H2O-H-2 Van der Waals complex using the accurate rigid-rotor potential energy surface of Valiron et al. (2008) with the MultiConfiguration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method. The J = 0-2 rovibrational bound states calculations are done with the Block Improved Relaxation procedure of MCTDH and the subsequent assignment of the states is achieved by inspection of the wavefunctions' properties. The results of this work are found to be in close agreement with previous time independent calculations reported for this complex and therefore supports the use of the MCTDH approach for the rovibrational spectroscopic study of such weakly bound complexes.

AB A set of twelve density functionals encompassing Jacob's ladder rungs (GGA, MGGA, HGGA, HMGGA and DHGGA) were analyzed to estimate the myricetin's global reactivity by Koopmans' theorem considering as a reference the finite difference approximation which is the most accurate way to compute some well-known global reactivity descriptors. Our findings revealed that the N12-SX density functional overcomes the results quality coming from other very common density functionals. Hereafter, these results confidently allow the use of the N12-SX to conduct calculations.

AB Potassium- and sodium-yttrium double tungstate nanopowders co-doped with Yb3+, Ho3+ ions were investigated for their magnetic properties for the first time. We performed the analysis of the compounds using two methods: Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPA) and static Magnetic Susceptibility (MS). We have described the symmetry of doped ions environment and corresponding magnetic, optical and structural properties of the above compounds obtained by hydrothermal and Pechini methods. It was performed for the compounds underwent to different calcination temperatures in the range from 600 degrees C to 800 degrees C. For potassium and sodium double tungstates the local symmetry of ytterbium ions is found to be C-2 and does not change with the calcination temperature rise. Based on the finite-size effect we determined the relative size of the nanoparticles agglomeration, observing changes in the values of Curie-Weiss temperature and the intensity of the EPR signal for various calcination temperatures. The magnetic and structural properties of nanoparticles were compared to corresponding ones registered for single crystals and crystalline powders obtained using other methods.

AB Benzene hydrogenation in the BTX mixture over various carbonaceous catalysts was evaluated in the range of 130-190 degrees C and at the variable partial pressure of the hydrogen (2.3-5.2 Pa) and benzene content (2-8 vol%). Under these conditions, the best activity was obtained for Ni-graphene at 190 degrees C with over 94% conversion. The highest selectivity to cyclohexane (> 60%) is related to Ni-activated carbon at 170 degrees C. To determine the kinetics parameters, Power-Law and Langmuir-Hinshelwood models have been tested. These models, provided a good fit toward the experimental data and allowed to determine the kinetics parameters that are in good agreement with both models.

AB These recommendations present an evidence-based assessment of provision of contraceptives at the time of surgical abortion. Most methods of contraception, including the intrauterine devices (IUD), implant, depot medroxyprogesterone injection, oral contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch, monthly vaginal ring, barrier methods and some permanent methods, can be safely initiated immediately after first- or second-trimester surgical abortion. Provision of postabortion contraceptives, particularly IUDs and implants, substantially reduces subsequent unintended pregnancy. IUD insertion immediately following uterine aspiration is safe. While this may be associated with a higher risk of device expulsion than with interval placement, expulsion rates remain low, and this risk must be weighed against the fact that patients often do not receive their desired IUD at an interval insertion and therefore experience higher rates of subsequent unintended pregnancy. Many patients experience barriers that prevent access to the full spectrum of postabortion contraceptive options, particularly IUDs and implants. Advancements in health-systems-based point-of-care provision and policies are needed to improve comprehensive contraceptive availability following surgical abortion. These recommendations will address clinical considerations for postabortion contraceptive provision and recommend interventions to improve contraceptive access following uterine evacuation.

TI First-trimester aspiration abortion practices: a survey of United States
   abortion providers
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Abortion, induced; Abortion techniques; Pregnancy trimester, first;
   Dilation and curettage; United States; Evidenced-based practice
ID SURGICAL ABORTION; SERVICE AVAILABILITY; PAIN-CONTROL; COMPLICATIONS
AB Objectives: To assess whether first-trimester aspiration abortion practices of US providers agree with evidence based policy guidelines.
   Study design: We sent surveys by mail or electronically to all abortion facilities in the United States identified via professional networks and websites from June through December 2013. Administrators reported on the volume of procedures performed at their site(s) through 13 weeks 6 days' gestation and on clinic services. Clinicians reported on personal demographic characteristics and abortion practices. We reviewed guidelines from key US professional organizations to determine how well reported practices aligned with available recommendations and the extent to which guidelines have changed since the time of the survey.
   Results: We identified 703 clinical sites in the United States; 383 (54%) sites responded, 256 of which offer first trimester aspiration abortions. Most providers identified as obstetrician-gynecologists (74%) and female (64%); 52% were less than 50 years old compared to 36% in 2002. Overall, reported practices follow evidence-based guidelines, including routine administration of periprocedure antibiotics (85%), use of misoprostol for cervical ripening in the late first trimester (94%), pain management practices, and same-day contraception provision (98%) including long-acting devices (76%). Less evidence-based practices include routine preprocedure ultrasound (99%), not providing abortion before 5 weeks' gestation (66%), restrictive fasting policies, and prolonged and postprocedure antibiotic provision.
   Conclusion: Overall, the first-trimester aspiration abortion practices revealed in our survey agree with professional evidence-based policy guidelines, though some related to preprocedure ultrasound use, very early abortion provision, preanesthesia fasting protocols, and antibiotic regimens deserve attention.
   Implications: In this third cross-sectional survey of US abortion practices (prior surveys 1997 and 2002), first-trimester aspiration abortion providers are younger than before, reflecting an improvement in the "graying" of the abortion provider workforce. Research and education are needed to further improve evidence-based practice in abortion care. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID CONTRACEPTIVE USE; HEALTH; PERSPECTIVES; AMBIVALENCE; WOMEN; INTENTION;

AB Objective: To understand how young people conceptualize planned, unplanned and "in-between" pregnancies.
   Methods: We conducted individual qualitative interviews with 50 young (ages 18-24) women and their male partners (n=100) in the San Francisco Bay Area to investigate prospective pregnancy intentions. In this analysis, we focused on participants' conceptualization of planned and unplanned pregnancies, as well as a status in between planned and unplanned.
   Results: Conceptualizations of pregnancy planning were influenced by personal experiences and life circumstances, including previous unplanned pregnancies. While many participants held up planned pregnancies as an ideal, the majority of participants (n=71) also felt that a status in between planned and unplanned pregnancy existed. Many described this in-between stage occurring when someone is "not not trying" or would find an unplanned pregnancy acceptable. Notably, a few participants mentioned that pregnancy planning was not possible because either it was uncommon among their peers or they felt a general lack of control over pregnancy.
   Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that binary operationalization of pregnancies as "planned" and "unplanned" neglects the complexity of young people's lived experiences and perspectives. Contraceptive counseling approaches that allow patients the flexibility to express their considerations and feelings toward a potential future pregnancy could improve the quality of family planning visits and patient-provider interactions.
   Implications: The traditional binary conceptualization of pregnancies as planned and unplanned may not holistically capture the diverse perspectives of young people. Increased understanding of the complexities in young people's conceptualizion of pregnancy planning can inform family planning care that is inclusive, relevant and supportive of a variety of perspectives.

AB Objectives: To explore women's responses to PATH questions (Pregnancy Attitudes, Timing and How important is pregnancy prevention) about hypothetical pregnancies and associations with contraceptive method selection among individuals who present as new contraceptive clients and desire to prevent pregnancy for at least 1 year.
   Study design: The HER Salt Lake Contraceptive Initiative provided no-cost contraception to new contraceptive clients for 1 year at family planning health centers in Salt Lake County. Those who wanted to avoid pregnancy for at least 1 year and completed the enrollment survey are included in the current study. We used Poisson regression to explore the association between survey-adapted PATH questions and contraceptive method selection.
   Results: Based on an analytic sample of 3121 individuals, we found pregnancy timing and happiness about hypothetical pregnancies to be associated with method selection. Clients who report plans to wait more than 5 years [prevalence rate (PR) 1.14; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.05-1.24], those who never wanted to become pregnant (PR 1.16; 95% CI 1.07-1.26) or those who were uncertain (PR=1.19; 95% CI 1.09-130) were all more likely to select IUDs and implants than women who reported wanting to become pregnant within 5 years. Greater happiness was associated with lower chance of choosing an IUD or implant (PR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96-0.999). Expressed importance of pregnancy prevention was not significantly associated with any specific contraceptive choice.
   Conclusions: Pregnancy intentions and happiness about a hypothetical pregnancy were independently associated with selection of IUDs and implants.
   Implications: Pregnancy attitudes, plans and emotions inform clients' contraceptive needs and behaviors. Client-centered contraceptive care may benefit from a more nuanced PATH approach rather than relying on a single time-oriented question about pregnancy intention. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The objective was to assess the feasibility of an intervention introducing family planning services screening clinical decision support to improve provision of contraception and/or preconception services for women of reproductive age in our primary care Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) network.
   Study design: We implemented a family planning services screening prompt for support staff to ask women 1344 years at nonobstetric visits at specified time intervals. The response was displayed in the electronic medical record for the provider to review, linked to a documentation tool. We evaluated staff comfort with the screening before and after rollout at all seven FQHC sites. At the pilot site, we examined implementation feasibility by assessing screening rate and the outcome measure of family planning (contraception and/or preconception) documentation during visits by women 13-44 years before and during the intervention's first year.
   Results: At baseline, support staff reported high level of comfort (60% very, 25% somewhat) in asking the family planning services screening question; this increased to 80% reporting they were "very comfortable" in the postsurvey (p = <.01). From mid-December 2016-mid-January 2018, the screening question was displayed for 1503 visits at the pilot site, of which 96% had a documented response. Family planning documentation rate at the pilot site showed a 6% increase from 64% during the preintervention period to 70% during the 13-month intervention period (p<.01). Time series analysis demonstrated more positive upward trend attributed to the intervention period (intervention R-2=0.15 vs. preintervention R-2=0.01).
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated high staff acceptability of the intervention at all sites and a high screening rate with a significant increase in family planning documentation rate at the pilot site during the intervention period. This suggests that this family planning services screening decision support intervention is feasible in an FQHC setting.
   Implications: Implementation of a family planning services screening decision support intervention is feasible in an FQHC setting. Further evaluation of performance at multiple sites, accounting for variable site characteristics, is needed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Medicaid and receipt of interval postpartum long-acting reversible
   contraception
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Postpartum contraception; LARC; Medicaid; Disparities
ID UNITED-STATES; WOMEN; PREGNANCY
AB Objective: We sought to evaluate the impact of insurance type on receipt of an interval postpartum LARC, controlling for demographic and clinical factors.
   Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study of 1072 women with a documented plan of LARC for contraception at time of postpartum discharge. This is a secondary analysis of 8654 women who delivered at 20 weeks or beyond from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014, at an urban teaching hospital in Ohio. LARC receipt within 90 days of delivery, time to receipt, and rate of subsequent pregnancy after non-receipt were compared between women with Medicaid and women with private insurance. Postplacental LARC was not available at the time of study completion.
   Results: One hundred eighty-seven of 822 Medicaid-insured and 43 of 131 privately insured women received a LARC postpartum (22.7% vs 32.8%, P=.02). In multivariable analysis, private insurance status was not significantly associated with LARC receipt (OR 1.29, 95% C.I. 0.83-1.99) though adequate prenatal care was (OR 2.33, 95% C.I. 1.42-4.00). Of women who wanted but did not receive a LARC, 208 of 635 (32.8%) Medicaid patients and 19 of 88 (21.6%) privately insured patients became pregnant within 1 year (P=.02).
   Conclusion: Differences in receipt of interval postpartum [ARC were not significant between women with Medicaid insurance versus private insurance after adjusting for clinical and demographic factors. Adequate prenatal care was associated with LARC receipt. Medicaid patients who did not receive a LARC were more likely to become pregnant within one year of delivery than those with private insurance.
   Implications: While insurance-related barriers have been reduced given recent policy changes, access to care remains an important determinant of postpartum LARC provision and subsequent unintended pregnancy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Prenatal intent and postpartum receipt of long-acting reversible
   contraception among women receiving medication-assisted treatment for
   opioid use disorder
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article

   reversible contraception
ID INTRAUTERINE-DEVICE; PREGNANT-WOMEN; INSERTION
AB Background: Many women with opioid use disorder (OUD) do not use highly effective postpartum contraception such as long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). We evaluated factors associated with prenatal intent and postpartum receipt of LARC among women receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD.
   Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study of 791 pregnant women with OUD on MAT who delivered at an academic institution without immediate postpartum LARC services between 2009 and 2012. LARC intent was defined as a documented plan for postpartum LARC during pregnancy and LARC receipt was defined as documentation of LARC placement by 8 weeks postpartum. We organized contraceptive methods into five categories: LARC, female sterilization, short-acting methods, barrier methods and no documented method. Multivariable logistic regression identified characteristics predictive of prenatal LARC intent and postpartum LARC receipt.
   Results: Among 791 pregnant women with OUD on MAT, 275 (34.8%) intended to use postpartum LARC and only 237 (29.9%) attended the postpartum visit. Among 275 women with prenatal LARC intent, 124 (45.1%) attended their postpartum visit and 50 (18.2%) received a postpartum LARC. Prenatal contraceptive counseling (OR 6.67; 95% CI 3.21, 13.89) was positively associated with LARC intent. Conversely, older age (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91, 0.98) and private practice provider (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.32, 0.72) were negatively associated with LARC intent. Although parity was not predictive of LARC intent, primiparous patients (CI 0.49; 95% CI 0.26, 0.97) were less likely to receive postpartum LARC.
   Conclusions: Discrepancies exist between prenatal intent and postpartum receipt of LARC among pregnant women with OUD on MAT. Immediate postpartum LARC services may reduce LARC access barriers.
   Implications: Despite prenatal interest in using LARC, most pregnant women with OUD on MAT did not receive postpartum LARC. The provision of immediate postpartum LARC services may reduce barriers to postpartum LARC receipt such as poor attendance at the postpartum visit. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Intended pregnancy after receiving vs. being denied a wanted abortion
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Abortion; Intended pregnancy; Planned pregnancy; Longitudinal
ID UNINTENDED PREGNANCY; UNITED-STATES; MENTAL-HEALTH; WOMEN
AB Objectives: To understand how having or being denied an abortion affects the likelihood of trying to become pregnant, overall pregnancy rates, and the rate and timing of an intended pregnancy in the future.
   Study design: The Turnaway Study is a prospective cohort study of women who received or were denied a wanted abortion. Women were recruited from one of 30 US abortion facilities. We examined subsequent intended pregnancy among those who presented just under the facility's gestational limit and received an abortion (Near-Limit Abortion Group, n=413) and those who presented for abortion just beyond the facility's gestational limit, were denied an abortion and went on to parent the child (Parenting Turnaways, n=146). First, we modeled the probability of trying to become pregnant using multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression. We then used Cox proportional-hazards models to compare overall pregnancy rates and intended pregnancy rates over 5 years.
   Results: Parenting Turnaways had lower predicted probabilities of reporting trying to become pregnant in the first 1.5 years after birth/abortion than the Near-Limit Abortion Group. They also had lower pregnancy rates overall [40.4 per 100 woman-years vs. 53.5 per 100 woman-years, adjusted hazards ratio (aHR)=0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54-0.89]. The 5-year intended pregnancy rate was low among both groups, but compared to the Near-Limit Abortion Group, Parenting Turnaways had a lower intended pregnancy rate (2.2 per 100 woman-years vs. 7.5 per 100 woman-years, aHR=0.29, 95% CI: 0.10-0.85).
   Conclusion: Being able to obtain a wanted abortion may enable women to have an intended pregnancy later.
   Implications: Ensuring that women can obtain an abortion for an unwanted pregnancy may enable them to have a subsequent pregnancy when they are ready to have a baby. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

DT Article
DE Title X; Abortion referrals; Policy; Texas
ID ABORTION REFERRALS; RESTRICTIVE LAW; CARE; SERVICES
AB Objectives: To compare pregnancy options counseling and referral practices at state- and Title X-funded family planning organizations in Texas after enforcement of a policy restricting abortion referrals for providers participating in state-funded programs, which differed from Title X guidelines to provide referrals for services upon request.
   Study design: Between November 2014 and February 2015, we conducted in-depth interviews with administrators at publicly funded family planning organizations in Texas about how they integrated primary care and family planning services, including pregnancy options counseling and referrals for unplanned pregnancies. We conducted a thematic analysis of transcripts related to organizations' pregnancy options counseling and referral practices, and compared themes across organizations that did and did not receive Title X funding.
   Results: Of the 37 organizations with transcript segments on options counseling and referrals, 15 received Title X and 22 relied on state funding only. All Title X-funded organizations but only nine state-funded organizations reported offering pregnancy options counseling. Respondents at state-only-funded organizations often described directing pregnant women exclusively to prenatal care. Regardless of funding source, most organizations provided women a list of agencies offering abortion, adoption and prenatal care. However, some respondents expressed concern that providing other information about abortion would threaten their state funding. In contrast, respondents indicated staff would make appointments for prenatal care, assist with Medicaid applications and, in some instances, directly connect women with adoption-related services.
   Conclusions: Pregnancy options counseling varied by organizations' funding guidelines. Additionally, abortion referrals were less common than referrals for other pregnancy-related care.
   Implications: Programmatic guidelines restricting information on abortion counseling and referrals may adversely affect care for pregnant women at publicly funded family planning organizations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Fertility app study design; Contraceptive efficacy studies
ID CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE; OVULATION
AB Objective: To assess six-cycle perfect and typical use efficacy of Dynamic Optimal Timing (Dot), an algorithm based fertility app that identifies the fertile window of the menstrual cycle using a woman's period start date and provides guidance on when to avoid unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.
   Study design: We are conducting a prospective efficacy study following a cohort of women using Dot for up to 13 cycles. Study enrollment and data collection are being conducted digitally within the app and include a daily coital diary, prospective pregnancy intentions and sociodemographic information. We used data from the first six cycles to calculate life-table failure rates.
   Results: We enrolled 718 women age 18-39 years. Of the 629 women 18-35 years old, 15 women became pregnant during the first six cycles for a typical use failure rate of 3.5% [95% CI 1.7-5.2]. All pregnancies occurred with incorrect use, so we did not calculate a perfect use failure rate.
   Conclusions: These findings are promising and suggest that the 13-cycle results will demonstrate high efficacy of Dot.
   Implications: While final 13-cycle efficacy results are forthcoming, 6-cycle results suggest that Dot's guidance provides women with useful information for preventing pregnancy. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

DT Article
DE Salpingectomy; Sterilization; Permanent contraception; Randomization
ID TUBAL-LIGATION; UNITED-STATES; STERILIZATION; OVARIAN; RISK;
   SALPINGECTOMY; TRENDS
AB Objective: To understand women's preferences for permanent contraception by salpingectomy or tubal occlusion following standardized counseling and evaluate the practicality of a future randomized trial.
   Study design: We invited pregnant and non-pregnant women planning permanent contraception at the University of California, Davis (UCD) and University of Tennessee (UT) Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics to participate. We enrolled women when they received routine counseling and signed procedure consent. Participants received standardized information sheets reviewing permanent contraception options based on pregnancy status then completed an anonymous survey with questions about demographics, method preference, and willingness to participate in a hypothetical randomized trial comparing salpingectomy and tubal occlusion. We evaluated predictors for salpingectomy preference using multivariable analysis.
   Results: From July 2015 to October 2016, we enrolled 75 women at UCD and 63 women at UT. Overall, respondents preferred salpingectomy (63.0%); among the 47 women not currently pregnant at both sites, 40 (85.1%) preferred salpingectomy, most commonly because of higher efficacy. Although population characteristics differed significantly between the sites, only UCD site (aOR 4.2; 95% CI 1.9, 9.4) and non pregnancy status (aOR 4.2; 95% CI 1.6, 10.8) predicted preference for salpingectomy in the multivariable model. Most participants (n=84, 60.9%) would not be willing to be randomized to a theoretical trial comparing salpingectomy and tubal occlusion procedures.
   Conclusion: Among a diverse group of women from two different areas in the U.S. given a choice of permanent contraception methods, salpingectomy is preferred over tubal occlusion. Most women planning a permanent contraceptive procedure would not agree to a randomized comparison of these methods.
   Implications statement: Salpingectomy, which offers theoretically higher efficacy and potentially greater ovarian cancer protection compared to tubal occlusion, is preferred by the majority of patients and should be offered to all women seeking permanent contraception. Differences in method choices less likely reflect the patient population and more likely the counseling provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To compare the effects of chlormadinone acetate (CMA), dienogest (DNG) and drospirenone (DRSP) on prostaglandin biosynthesis in a human endometrial explants model.
   Study design: Human endometrial explants obtained by aspiration curettage and human endometrial YHES cells were stimulated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and exposed to CMA, DNG, DRSP or dexamethasone (DEX; YHES cells). Cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were analyzed by reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Concentrations of prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) in culture supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results: CMA exerted after IL-1 beta stimulation a stronger down-regulation of COX-2 mRNA compared to DNG and DRSP in human explants (-55% vs. -40% and 46%, respectively). The effect of CMA on COX-2 mRNA was significantly stronger (p=.025) than that of DNG. Moreover, the effect of CMA was independent from cycle phase or presence of endometriosis. In order to evaluate the impact of the investigated progestins on effector molecules, PGF(2 alpha) release was determined in supernatants. Again, CMA reduced the PGF(2 alpha) release significantly by an average of -60% (p<.01). In contrast, no significant reduction was found for DNG and DRSP. In YHES cells, only DEX but not the progestins under study exerted a significant down-regulating effect (-79%, p<.01) on COX-2 mRNA after IL-1 beta stimulation.
   Conclusion: Among the tested progestins, CMA displayed the most consistent suppression of prostaglandin biosynthesis in human endometrial explants.
   Implication: Among three tested progestins, chlormadinone acetate had the most consistent suppressive effect on prostaglandins in endometrial explants. These findings support clinical observations about the efficacy of chlormadinone acetate in dysmenorrhea treatment. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent form of aging-related joint diseases, and its etiology is still not fully understood. Obesity has been recognized as one of the most significant and potentially preventable risk factors for osteoarthritis. Beyond mechanical loading, adipokines, including leptin, visfatin, adiponectin, resistin and others, are demonstrated to have metabolic implications in the pathogenesis and progression in obesity-induced osteoarthritis by modulating the pro/anti-inflammatory and anabolic/catabolic balance, apoptosis, matrix remodeling and subchondral bone ossification. Accordingly, adipokines emerge as potential candidates to link these two entities, and may serve as putative targets for disease-modifying drugs for osteoarthritis, especially for obese patients. Here we summarize studies over the past decades on the pivotal role of adipokine family in osteoarthritis, and aim to shed a light on the causative link between obesity and osteoarthritis. Notably, due to difficulties in separation of the metabolic effect from the mechanical effect of fat excess, researches on osteoarthritis in non-weight-bearing joints may provide a promising direction and more emphasis shall be put on them in future.

AB Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is involved in the tissue repair and tumor progression effects, and act as a rapid and early effector cytokines which are released in response to, pathogen-induced changes in the microenvironment. Recent researches have implicated PDGF-BB as a potential contributing factor to the spectrum of the cell signaling pathway of interrelated diseases, particularly mesangial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, human dermal fibroblasts, tumor pericytes and smooth muscle cells. In this review, we generalize the present literatures on the roles of PDGF-BB in the various interrelated diseases, providing insights or strategies into the underlying cellular and signaling mechanisms that will help guide future studies further into promising interventional targets with therapeutic potential.

AB Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), is one of the most important devastating diseases of pigs, characterized by reproductive failure in sows, and respiratory disease with heavy mortality in piglets. PRRS virus has been reported to elevate the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum of infected pigs. High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB-1) protein is a cellular biomolecule belonging to the Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMP) family, which stimulates immune cells to release pro inflammatory cytokines upon release out of cells. The role of HMGB-1 in the pathogenesis of PRRSV remains largely unknown. In the present study, HMGB-1 levels in serum samples collected from six-week-old piglets infected intra-nasally with 2 x 10(5.75) TCID50/mL of Indian PRRSV (Ind-297221/2013) was estimated by ELISA up to 21 days post infection (dpi). Pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF- alpha) expression in PBL was estimated by SYBR green based real time PCR. Mean HMGB-1 concentration in serum was found to be significantly elevated in PRRSV infected piglets on 6 dpi as compared to uninfected control piglets. At mRNA level, significant increase in expression of HMGB-1 was observed from 4 to 5 dpi and from 11 to 13 dpi. IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA were significantly upregulated between 4 and 6 dpi. Significant increase in TNF-alpha gene expression was seen only on 7 and 9 dpi. Higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and HMGB-1 could be correlated with fever which was observed within 7 dpi in all the infected piglets and additionally around 13 dpi in the animal that died on 17 dpi. Thus, elevated HMGB-1 level in PRRSV infected piglets could be correlated with concurrent increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6) mRNA. In-vitro studies were conducted in PRRSV infected Porcine Pulmonary Alveolar Macrophages (PAM) to ascertain HMGB-1 role in PRRS pathogenesis. The results of both in-vivo and in-vitro studies showed that HMGB-1 plays an important role in mediating the pro inflammatory cytokine responses in PRRS pathogenesis.

AB Human interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) plays an important role in the innate antiviral immune response. To date, the characteristics and functions of waterfowl IRF7 have not been clarified. This study reports the cDNA sequence, tissue distribution, and antiviral function of duck IRF7. The duck IRF7 gene has a 1536-bp open read frame (ORF) and encodes a 511-amino acid polypeptide. IRF7 is highly expressed in the blood and pancreas of 5 day -old ducklings and in the small intestine, large intestine and liver of 60-day-old adult ducks. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) showed that over-expressed duck IRF7 was located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), which was also observed in poly(I:C)-stimulated or duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV)-infected DEFs. Titres and copies of DTMUV were significantly reduced in DEFs over expressing IRF7. Moreover, overexpression of duck IRF7 significantly induced IFN alpha/beta, but not IFN gamma, mRNA expression, and transcription of downstream interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as MX, OASL and IL-6, which were significantly induced by poly(I:C) co-stimulation, was enhanced. Additionally, duck IRF7 over expression can significantly activate the IFN beta promoter in DEFs. Collectively, duck IRF7 plays an important role in host anti-DTMUV immune regulation, which depends on type I interferons and associated signal transduction pathway(s).

AB The main objective of this investigation was to determine whether, despite acute (wasting) deficits of dietary nitrogen and energy, weanling mice could respond to the dendritic cell hematopoietin, Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (F1t3L), in terms of an index of cell-mediated inflammatory competence. Male and female C57BL/6J weanlings were used, initially 19 days of age, and malnutrition was produced using a nitrogen-deficient diet. In preliminary work ten daily subcutaneous 1.0 tig doses of murine FIt3L, comparable to a protocol effective in humans, expanded the splenic conventional dendritic cell compartment (CD11c(+)F4/80(-/low)) of healthy weanlings without affecting the numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, or recoverable mononuclear cells. Two subsequent experiments showed that, despite advancing malnutrition, exogenous F1t3L was able both to exert its classic influence on splenic conventional dendritic cell numbers and to invigorate the attenuated primary splenic cell-mediated inflammatory response to sheep erythrocytes. A final experiment showed that the cytokine intervention did not affect dendritic cell maturity according to several phenotypic indices. The findings provide new support for the proposition that dendritic cell numbers are the first limiting factor in the weak cell-mediated immune competence of acute pre-pubescent malnutrition. More substantially, intervention with F1t3L sustained an inflammatory systemic immune character despite progressive weanling malnutrition and weight loss. This outcome provides new support of fundamental character for the Tolerance Model which posits that the cell mediated inflammatory incompetence of acute pre-pubescent protein and energy deficits is a regulated adaptive attempt, the antithesis of the classic paradigm of unregulated immunological attrition.

AB Background: Immune tolerance seems to correlate with disease progression and T regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells play a relevant role in immunosuppression. Cyclophosphamide (Cyt) and Fluorouracil (FU) seem to reduce these cell populations.
   Methods and objective: Establishing safety, feasibility, activity and impact on the immune system (neutrophil/ lymphocyte [N/L1, platelet/L [Plt/L), monocyte [MI and lymphocyte subpopulation (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, HLADR/CD3, Tregs, cells count), CD8/Treg and C-reactive protein (CRP).
   Treatment: 1) Cyt 300 mg/sqm FU 500 mg/sqm day (d) 1 and interleukin 2 (IL-2) 18 MUI/sqm intravenous (I.V.) d 4-6, 18-20 or 2) Cyt 300 mg/ sqm + FU 500 mg/sqm day d 1, IL-2 4.5 MUI subcutaneous (S.C.) d 3-6, 17-20. The cycle was repeated every four weeks for 2 cycles. Stable or responding patients (pts) continued therapy for 3 cycles.
   Results: From February 2014 to December 2016, 13/14 pre-treated pts (mean 3 lines) with solid tumors were enrolled. Male/Female: 1/1. The median age and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) was 68 years and 1 respectively. Mean 2 cycles of therapy were administered. G3-4 toxicities presented as diarrhea and bleeding anemia in 2 pts and proteinuria and erhytroderma in 1pt, respectively. Regarding the hematological profile, a more reduction in Plt, less decrease of Plt/Ly, and less increase of Treg with I.V. than S.C. IL-2 administration was observed. However a transient decrease of Treg on day 7 of first cycle in the I.V. IL-2 was reported.
   Response: PR 3 (23%), SD 3 (23%), PD 7 (54%). The response duration was 2+ and 3 months in 2 HCC and 18+ months in the pancreatic cancer (PC). Pathological CR was reported in one HCC treated with I.V. IL-2. The median progression-free-survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 1 and 7 months.
   Conclusion: Cyt-FU-IL-2 can be considered safe, feasible and moderately active in heavily pre-treated pts. Plt, Plt/Ly, CD8/Treg and a transient Tregs reduction were observed without significative difference on survival.

AB Background and aims: Macrophages derived from monocytes play an important role in atherosclerosis progression. Subpopulations of circulating classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes possess distinct functions and phenotypes, and participate in the pathogenesis of disease. The aim of this study was to compare the quantity and phenotypes of circulating monocyte subpopulations in patients with established atherosclerosis and healthy control individuals. Additionally, the study aimed to provide insight into the functional activity of monocytes against a heat shock protein (HSP60).
   Methods: Chemokine and pattern recognition receptors in monocyte subsets obtained from peripheral blood of acute and chronic coronary artery disease patients and controls were quantified by flow cytometry. Furthermore, monocytes from healthy controls were stimulated in vitro with HSP60, and the cytokines produced by them were evaluated by flow cytometry.
   Results: Eighteen controls (C), 34 individuals with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (RF), 32 patients with stable angina (SA), and 16 patients with unstable angina (UA) were enrolled in the study. The absolute count of intermediate monocytes was found to be increased in patients of the UA group; high frequencies of the chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5, and CX3CR1 were also observed in this subpopulation. Moreover, the pattern recognition receptors TLR2 and TLR4 were more frequent in intermediate monocytes from the UA group. Furthermore, the intermediate monocytes from healthy individuals produced IL-12p70 after stimulation with HSP60.
   Conclusions: Our results show that intermediate monocytes of UA patients exhibited an enhanced expression of the receptors involved in the recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and enhancement of the migratory function. Hence, they might contribute to the propagation and progression of inflammation observed in atherosclerosis, especially in the acute setting.

AB Background: Lymphocytes play a key role in asthma pathophysiology, secreting various cytokines involved in chronic inflammation. CHF6001 is a highly potent and selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor designed for inhaled administration and has been shown to reduce the late asthmatic response. However, the effect of PDE4 inhibition on the different cytokines produced by lung lymphocytes from asthma patients has not been examined.
   Methods: This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of CHF6001 and the corticosteroid, 17-BMP, on T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulated Thl, Th2 and Th17 cytokine release from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from mild (n = 12) and moderate asthma (n = 12) patients.
   Results: CHF6001 inhibited IFN gamma, IL-2 and IL-17, but not IL-13, secretion from both mild and moderate asthma patient BAL cells; there was a greater effect on IFN gamma and IL-2 than IL-17. The corticosteroid inhibited all four cytokines from both patient groups, but was less effective in cells from more severe patients. CHF6001 had a greater inhibitory effect on IFN gamma and IL-2 than 17-BMP.
   Conclusion: The PDE4 inhibitor CHF6001 had a greater effect on Thl cytokines from TCR-stimulated BAL cells than corticosteroid. This pharmacological effect suggests the therapeutic potential for PDE4 inhibitors to be used in the subset of more severe asthma patients with increased airway levels of IFN gamma.

AB The Hyaluronic Acid-rich Node and Duct System (HAR-NDS or NDS), Primo Vascular System (PVS) or Bonghan System (BHS), is thought to be a third circulatory system independent of the blood and lymphatic systems and a structure of connected nodes and ducts. Although it seems to be part of the immune system as it is enriched with cells of innate immunity, little is known about its immunological roles. We performed cellular profiling and secretome analysis of NDS in a steady state and under TLR2- or TLR4-mediated local inflammation, and found that the NDS is pre-dominantly enriched with the myeloid cells, selectively attracts the inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils, has a flexible structure just like the lymph node, and is structured with the fibroblastic reticular cells and reticular network. NDS dominantly harbored the myeloid cells in both steady and activated status, and secreted various types of inflammatory cytokines by proinflammatory stimuli. These results suggest that NDS is the lymphoid structure for the innate immunity and plays an intermediary role in the innate immune cell-mediated local inflammation.

AB Introduction: The effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and simvastatin combination therapy on serum total and specific IgE levels and lung IL-13 and TGF-beta levels in sensitized mouse were examined.
   Material and methods: Control (n = 5), Sensitized (S), (n = 5), S + BMSC (n = 6), S + simvastatin (n = 6) and S + BMSC + simvastatin (n = 4) groups of BALB/c mice were studied. Mice were sensitized by ovalbumin. Sensitized mice were treated with a single intravenous injection of BMSCs (1 x 10(6)) or daily intraperitoneal injection of simvastatin (40 mg/kg) or both BMSCs and simvastatin on the last week of challenge. Serum total and ovalbumin specific IgE levels as well as IL-13 and TGF-beta levels in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were evaluated.
   Results: Serum total and specific IgE levels as well as lung IL-13 and TGF-beta levels were significantly increased in S group compared to control group (P < 0.001 for all cases). Treatment with BMSCs, simvastatin and their combination significantly decreased serum total and specific IgE levels (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). However, IL-13 and TGF-beta levels were significantly decreased by BMSCs and BMSC + simvastatin combination therapy (P < 0.05 for all cases). The effect of simvastatin and BMSCs combination therapy on serum specific IgE levels as well as lung IL-13 and TGF-13 levels were significantly higher than the effect of BMSCs and simvastatin alone (P < 0.001 for IL-13 and P < 0.01 for other cases).
   Conclusions: Simvastatin and BMSCs combination therapy affects serum IgE as well as lung IL-13 and TGF beta levels more than BMSC therapy and simvastatin therapy alone which may be due to increased BMSCs migration into the lung tissue.

AB This study aims to explore a relationship between exposures of whole-cell Porphyromonas gingivalis in various doses with atopic inflammatory responses at experimental mice. A pretest-posttest controlled group design, with 16 Wistar rats (Rattus novergicus) randomized into four groups. Group 1 was the control group. Group 2 was given low-dose (9 x 10(7) colony-forming unit) of P. gingivalis. Group 3 was given medium-dose (9 x 10(9) colony forming unit) of P. gingivalis. Group 4 was given high-dose (9 x 10(11) colony-forming unit) of P. gingivalis. Interleukin-4, Interleukin-5, Interleukin-17F, Interleukin-21, Immunoglobulin-E, Immunoglobulin-G(4), and gamma-Interferon were measured by direct-sandwich ELISA just before the treatments began, day-4, and day-11 after treatments. There is a sudden increase of Interleukin-4 in the group 4 (23.79 +/- 0.91 pg/ml to 54.17 +/- 0.79 pg/ ml; p = 0.01) and slight increase of Interleukin-5 in the group 4 (207.60 +/- 11.15 pg/ml to 243.40 9.33 pg/ ml; p = 0.03). No change was observed for Interleukin-17F in all groups. Serum concentration of Immunoglobulin-E was decreased in group 2 ( 10.44 8.13 pg/ml), but increased in group 4 (+/- 1.03 +/- 4.57 pg/mI). Taken together, some cytokines are up-regulated and others are down-regulated after exposure to whole-cell P. gingivalis. Moreover, study of host responses during periodontal infection may offer critical key insight that contribute to the development of atopy.
   Clinical implications: We introduced and explained the potential role of periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis in systemic immune responses, along with its virulence factor inside the oral cavity. Our results consider several changes and differences of cytokines and immunoglobulins following whole-cell Porphyromonas gingivalis exposure. However, results of the study need to be interpreted with caution due to its limitations. Capsule summary: Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 had been found increase after exposure to the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, whereas no or minimal change had been found in the level of IL-17F, Ig-G(4), and IFN-y. The various cytokines and immunoglobulins shown in this study do not prove a causal relationship, and the precise role of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the regulation of atopic immune response warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, these findings may provide some critical key insight into the host responses following Porphyromonas gingivalis infection.

AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for high-grade cervical lesions and cervical cancer. The inflammation plays a key role in cervical cancer progression. In this context, studies propose an association between TNFa and IL10 SNPs and susceptibility to HPV infection. The present work aimed to investigate the possible association between IL10 and TNFa promoter polymorphisms and HPV infection in the cervical carcinogenesis risk in women from Brazil. A total of 654 samples was evaluated in this study. HPV detection was performed by PCR and HPV genotyping was performed by PCR and sequencing of positive MY09/11 PCR product. Genotyping of IL10 SNPs (rs1800871 and rs1800896) was performed by High Resolution Melt analysis. Genotyping of TNFa SNP (rs1800629) was performed by fluorogenic allele-specific probes. The distribution of TNF-308 (rs1800629) allelic (p = 0.03) and genotype (p = 0.03) frequencies and HPV-58 infection has showed a statistically significant difference between case and control groups for the assessed TNFa polymorphism. When it comes to TNFa (rs1800629) allelic and genotypic distribution and HPVs 18 and 31 infections, no statistically significant differences between case and control groups were observed for the studied TNFa polymorphism. The allelic and genotypic distribution of IL10-819 (rs1800871) and IL10-1082 (rs1800896) and HPV infection (HPVs 58, 18 and 31) has showed no statistically significant differences between case and control groups for the assessed IL10 polymorphisms. Furthermore, it was observed that haplotypes were associated with an increased cervical cancer risk in HPVs 16, 18 and 58-positive women. It was observed that women carrying the GTA and ATG haplotypes had 3.85 and 17.99-fold, respectively, increased cervical cancer susceptibility when infected by HPV-58. In women infected with HPV-16 and HPV-18, statistically significant results in women carrying the GTA and ATA haplotypes was observed. They had a 2.32 and 3.67-fold, respectively, increased cervical cancer susceptibility when infected by these two HPV types. The analysis of the haplotypes distribution in women infected with HPV-31 has showed no statistically significant results. Our study indicates that the association of genetic polymorphism in inflammation-related genes represents a risk to the susceptibility in the development of cervical cancer in women infected by HPVs 16, 18 and 58.

AB Background & purpose: Recent studies suggested a role of prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) in the expression of the chemokine IL-8 by monocytes. The function of EP4 receptor for TNF alpha-induced IL-8 expression was studied in monocytic cell lines.
   Experimental approach: IL-8 mRNA and protein induction as well as IL-8 promoter activity and transcription factor activation were assessed in monocytic cell lines, primary blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and transgenic HEK293 cells expressing the EP4 receptor.
   Key results: In monocytic cell lines THP-1, MonoMac and U937 PGE(2) had only a marginal impact on IL-8 induction but strongly enhanced TNFa-induced IL-8 mRNA and protein synthesis. Similarly, in PBMC IL-8 mRNA induction was larger by simultaneous stimulation with TNF alpha and PGE(2) than by either stimulus alone. The EP4 receptor subtype was the most abundant EP receptor in all three cell lines and in PBMC. Stimulation of THP-1 cells with an EP4 specific agonist enhanced TNF alpha-induced IL-8 mRNA and protein formation to the same extent as PGE(2). In HEK293 cells expressing EP4, but not in wild type HEK293 cells lacking EP4, PGE(2) enhanced TNFainduced IL-8 protein and mRNA synthesis. In THP-1 cells, the enhancement of TNF alpha-mediated IL-8 mRNA induction by PGE(2) was mimicked by a PICA-activator. Furthermore in these cells PGE(2) induced expression of transcription factor C/EBPS, enhanced NF-KB activation by TNFa and inhibited TNF alpha-mediated AP-1 activation. PGE(2) and TNF alpha synergistically activated transcription factor CREB, induced C/EBPS expression and enhanced the activity of an IL-8 promoter fragment containing-223 bp upstream of the transcription start site.
   Conclusions and implications: These findings suggest that a combined stimulation of TNF alpha and PGE(2)/EP4 signal chains in monocytic cells leads to maximal IL-8 promoter activity, as well as IL-8 mRNA and protein induction, by activating the PICA/CREB/C/EB1313 as well as NF-kappa B signal chains.

AB Inappropriate angiogenesis and osteogenesis are considered as the crucial factors of osteoporotic fracture. Hypoxia is a primary driving force for regulating the angiogenic-osteogenic coupling process. Our recent results indicated that hypoxia could improve angiogenesis as well as differentiation and activity of osteoblastic cells via up-regulating VEGF through HIF-1 alpha pathway. Here we demonstrated that in human osteoblastic MG-63, U2-OS and Saos-2 cells, besides VEGF, the other two pro-angiogenic factors IL-6 and IL-8 were also up-regulated by hypoxia and CoCl2 (a mimic of hypoxia). Mechanism studies indicated overexpression of HIF-1 alpha (generated from transfection with a plasmid encoding sense HIF-1 alpha) markedly increased the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in osteoblastic cells. Furthermore, a luciferase reporter assay was performed using the reporter vector containing the IL-6 or IL- 8 promoter sequence to illustrate observably increased activity of hypoxia-induced IL-6 and IL-8 promoter caused by overexpression of HIF-l1 alpha. Additionally, chromatin immune-precipitation analysis showed hypoxia increased the DNA binding ability of HIF-1 alpha to IL-6 or IL-8 promoter. Analysis in vitro by MTT test and Boyden chamber assay showed exogenous IL-6 and IL-8 (a relatively short period of treatment with recombinant IL-6 or IL-8 equivalent to the autocrine levels) could significantly promote the proliferation of human osteoblastic, endothelial and monocytic cells, as well as the migration of human endothelial cells. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-6 and IL-8 in osteoblastic cells may also contribute to the angiogenic-osteogenic coupling process via HIF-1 alpha pathway. Besides VEGF, IL-6- or IL-8-targeted adjunctive therapy maybe a new strategy to improve the treatment of osteoporosis.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the time-course of serum and wound fluids interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 levels in dogs with cutaneous wounds and their relationship with some haematologic parameters. The experimental group comprised of six adult dogs that underwent surgery with wounds (n = 6) on the mid lateral aspect of the right antebrachium; and control group of six, apparently, healthy intact (free from cutaneous wounds) adult dogs, comprising equal number of both sexes. Vital signs evaluated were within normal limits. Samples of blood, serum and wound fluids harvested pre- and at 12 h, 36 h, 60 h, 156 h and 324 h post-injury, were utilised for IL-6 and IL-8 assay and haematology. Peak concentrations of IL-6 in wound fluid (1.33. +/- 0.33 ng/mL) and serum (0.82 +/- 0.24 ng/mL) of the experimental group at 12 h post-operation were higher (P < 0.01) than the control (0.30 +/- 0.05 ng/mL). Concentrations of IL-8 at 12 h and 60 h in wound fluid (0.21 +/- 0.05 ng/mL and 0.22 +/- 0.11 ng/mL) respectively were lower (P < 0.05) than serum (0.71 +/- 0.21 ng/mL and 0.73 +/- 0.24 ng/mL) respectively in the experimental group and corresponding values recorded in controls (0.34 +/- 0.09 ng/mL and 0.36- 0.14 ng/mL). The haematological and biochemical parameters exhibited minimum fluctuations, but values were within normal ranges. Significant correlations were obtained between serum and wound fluid IL-6 (r = 0.827, P < 0.05); wound fluid IL-6 and monocyte count (r = 0.818, P < 0.04); wound fluid IL-6 and haematocrit (r = 0.894, P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between serum IL-8 and serum IL-6 (r = 0.622, P > 0.05) and serum IL-8 and wound fluid IL-8 (r = 0.718, P > 0.05) in the experimental group. In conclusion, IL-6 and IL-8 exerted modulated inflammatory processes following cutaneous wounds in dogs. Further studies are required to investigate the expression patterns of IL-6 and IL-8 in cutaneous wounds in order to improve the quality of management of cutaneous wounds.

AB Objective: The following study investigated the serum adiponectin, chemerin and vaspin levels and their relationship with body mass index (BMI), glucose and lipid metabolism in girls with Turner Syndrome (TS). Methods: A total of 64 girls with TS (mean age, 12.22 +/- 3.98 years; mean BMI, 18.90 +/- 3.45 kg/m(2)) were ascertained by chromosome analysis. Height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference and blood pressure were measured, as well as the levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG). The BMI, BMI standard deviation score (SDS), waist to hip ratio, waist to height ratio and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) were calculated. The TS group and the control group were subdivided into non-puberty or puberty subgroup. Results: The TS group had higher waist to hip ratio and waist to height ratio compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in FPG, fasting plasma insulin, HOMA-IR, blood lipid and blood pressure between the two groups. Significantly higher serum levels of adioponectin (12.51 +/- 4.58 pg/m1) and chemerin (173.71 +/- 37.88 ng/ml) and significantly lower levels of vaspin (0.67 +/- 0.47 ng/ml) were found in the TS group compared to the control group (9.30 +/- 3.17 pg/ml, 159.43 +/- 23.19 ng/ml and 1.06 +/- 0.49 ng/ml, respectively) (all P < 0.05). In the TS group, adiponectin levels were negatively correlated with age, BMI and TG (r = 0.251, 0.247, 0.294, P < 0.05 for all). In the control group, adiponectin levels were negatively correlated with BMI and BMI SDS (r = 0.416 and 0.315, P < 0.05 for both), while vaspin levels were positively correlated with age, fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR (r = 0.257, 0.273 and 0.282, P < 0.05 for all). In addition, significantly higher levels of adiponectin were found in the non-puberty subgroup (13.88 +/- 4.49) pg/ml compared to puberty subgroup (9.72 3.39) pg/ml (P < 0.05), while no significant differences in chemerin and vaspin were found between the two TS subgroups. Conclusions: Elevated adiponectin and chemerin levels and significantly reduced vaspin were found in girls with TS. Puberty or estrogen replacement therapy may reduce adiponectin in girls with TS.

AB Interleukin (IL)-29 is known to modulate immune functions of monocytes or macrophages. In this study, we investigated the effect and its underlying mechanism of IL-29 on receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis using murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells and bone-marrow-derived monocyte/macrophage precursor cells (BMMs), and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In response to human recombinant IL-29, cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry; the osteoclast formation and activity by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and pit formation assay, respectively; the expression and activation of molecules that associated with osteoclastogenesis by real time-PCR, immunoblotting or immunofluorescent analysis. IL-28 receptor a (IL-28Ra), a specific receptor of IL-29 was expressed on RAW264.7 cells. Although IL-29 did not affect the viability and apoptosis of RAW264.7 cells, it inhibited multinucleated cells in the differentiation of osteoclastogenesis, the bone-resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts and osteoclastic specific genes expression including TRAP, cathepsin K (CTSK), nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), C-Fos and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9). This inhibitory effect of IL-29 was confirmed on BMMs and PBMCs and mediated via IL-28Ra through the activation of Statl and 3 and the suppression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and NFATcl nuclear translocation in RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, IL-29 inhibited osteoclastogenesis via activation of STAT signaling pathway, prevention of NF-kappa B activation and NFATcl translocation, and suppression of downstream osteoclastogenic genes expression.

AB Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, S100A8/A9, and S100Al2 are involved in innate immune responses. We addressed whether different aspects of oral health and non-disease-related covariates influence their levels in saliva. 436 participants were clinically examined, completed a health questionnaire, and provided stimulated saliva. Salivary levels of MMP-12, S100A8/A9, and S100Al2 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Lower MMP-12 levels were observed in individuals 40-64 years old (yo) compared to < 40 yo, and higher S100A8/A9 levels were found in individuals > 64 yo compared to 40-64 yo. Smokers exhibited lower MMP-12 and S100Al2 levels compared to non-smokers. All three proteins were elevated in individuals with bleeding on probing (BOP) > 20% compared to those with BOP <= 20%, and the S100A8/A9 levels were higher in individuals having >= 10% gingival pocket depths (PPD) >= 4 mm compared to the ones with shallow pockets < 4 mm. The extent of alveolar bone loss or presence of manifest caries did not alter any of the markers. MMP-12, S100A8/A9, and S100A12 levels were higher in participants with high periodontal inflammatory burden. All three proteins correlated positively to BOP, PPD, and to several inflammatory mediators. The explanatory variables for MMP-12 in saliva were age, smoking, presence of any tumor, and percentage of PPD 4 mm. The determinant of salivary S100A8/A9 was percentage of BOP, while S100Al2 levels were associated with percentage of BOP and presence of any tumor. Taken together, MMP-12 and the S100/calgranulin levels in saliva reflect different aspects of periodontal inflammation. Smoking and age should be taken into account in further investigation of these proteins as biomarker candidates of periodontal disease.

AB Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are pertinent to cancer cell growth in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, TAMs differentiate from monocytes (M.:13) due to specific growth factors present in the tumor micro environment. TAMs show mostly an M2-like phenotype is due to the absence of pro-inflammatory signals and supply fuel to tumor growth. Several attempts have been taken to switch TAMs into a pro-immunogenic type. To address context, we used a tumor microenvironment by in vitro coculturing human blood M Phi with cancer cell conditioned media (TC-M Phi). We showed that the antigen cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) can reprogram TC-M Phi to pro-immunogenic type to build up an antitumor immune response. Our results demonstrate that NPsAg induced a marked activation of NADPH oxidase in TC-McD, likely through stimulation of ROS linked to activation of p38 MAPK. These activated p38 MAPK up-regulated the IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and initial IL-12 production, in turn, the activation of IFN-gamma prolonged IL-12 production.

AB Asthma and allergy affect hundreds of millions of people from childhood to old age. In most of them, the inflammatory process of respiratory allergies involves the participation of type 2 cytokines, derived from T helper-2 (Th2)-cell, and Group 2 Innate Lymphoid (ILC2) Cells. An efficient memory Th2 cell response is dependent on IL-13 produced by ILC2s, causing allergic lung inflammation and elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E. ILC2 cells are derived from common lymphoid progenitors and their growing depends on the transcription factor RORA. The aim of this work was to identify genetic variants in RORA associated with asthma phenotypes and allergy markers. Genomic DNA samples of 1246 individuals participating from Social Changes Asthma and Allergy in Latin America Program (SCAALA) have been genotyped using Illumina Human 2.5 Omni Beadchip. Logistics regressions have been performed to analyze the association among RORA variants and asthma, skin prick tests (SPT), specific IgE and type 2 cytokine production. Twelve single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were significantly associated with atopy (P < 0.01), in which four of them, rs10162630, rs17191519, rs17270243, and rs55796775 and their haplotypes were strongly and positively associated (P < 0.001). Furthermore, these variants increased the RORA gene expression in silico analysis. Other SNVs in RORA were associated with allergy markers, atopic and non-atopic asthma. Therefore, it is believed that variants in RORA gene may influence immunologic features of asthma and allergies and could be possible targets for future treatment of allergic diseases.

AB Introduction: A growing body of evidence indicates that brain cytokines are involved in the control of the cardiovascular system. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is an archetypal cytokine, which exerts its proinflammatory actions via type 1 receptor (TNFR1). Interleukin 10 (IL-10) plays a critical anti-inflammatory role by binding to its receptor (IL-10Ra). The orchestrated inflammatory response is largely dependent on an intricate balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and expression of their receptors. Aim In the study we evaluated the expression of the cytokines and their receptors in the brains of spontaneously hypertensive (SH) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, and how the cytokines affect arterial blood pressure.
   Methods: In SH and WKY rats we recorded systolic blood pressure with tail cuff method and measured concentration of TNF, IL-10, TNFR1, and IL-10Ra in the serum, the brainstem, and the hypothalamus; we also measured serum concentrations of copeptin, a surrogate of vasopressin release, angiotensin II and nor epinephrine. We immunostained brainstem sections for TNFR1, IL-10Ra, neurons, astrocytes and microglia for confocal imaging. In urethane anaesthetized SH and WKY rats, we invasively recorded blood pressure response to intracerebroventricular (IVC) infusion of TNF or IL-10. We also pharmacologically evaluated baroreflex with phenylephrine and chemoreflex with cyanide in SH and WKY rats.
   Results: Compared to WKY rats, SH rats had: (1) higher blood pressure; (2) blunted baroreflex and augmented peripheral chemoreflex; (3) greater pressor response to ICV infused TNF and greater hypotensive response to ICV infused IL-10; (4) higher concentration of TNF in the ventral and dorsal aspects of the medulla oblongata; (5) higher expression of TNFR1 in the dorsal medulla; (6) higher concentration of IL-10 in both aspects of the medulla; (7) lower expression of IL-10Ra in the dorsal medulla. Confocal imaging showed co-localization of TNFR1 and IL-10Ra with neurons, astrocytes and microglia in both SH and WKY rats. The concentration of the cytokines and their receptors were significantly higher in the brain than in the serum. There were no significant differences in the concentration of the cytokines and their receptors in the hypothalamic region and in the serum between SH and WKY rats. Serum concentrations of norepinephrine, angiotensin II and copeptin were similar between SH and WKY rats.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest the presence of a potent milieu for effective TNF signalling in the brainstem, which is associated with the hypertensive phenotype and enhanced hemodynamic response to intrabrain administration of the cytokines. In addition, we hypothesize that the increased IL-10 concentration in the brainstem is a compensatory mechanism for the upregulated TNF system.

AB Pregnancy in sickle cell disease is a problem due to the adverse outcomes related to the disease. Research into the role of chemokines in sickle cell disease is available, but studies investigating the disease in pregnancy are scarce. Our data show the chemokine profiles of pregnant women with sickle cell disease compared with control groups. There were no differences in MCP-1 level among the groups, but IL-8 and MIG were likely related with disease activity. In addition, levels of IP-10 were higher in pregnant women with sickle cell disease and, interestingly, RANTES levels were higher in normal pregnancy when compared to pregnancy in sickle cell disease. More studies should be encouraged to fully elucidate chemokine activity during pregnancy in sickle cell disease.

AB The shift of macrophage and T-cell repertoires towards proinflammatory cytokine signalling ensures the generation of host-protective machinery that is otherwise compromised in cases of the intracellular Leishmania parasite. Different groups have attempted to restore host protective immunity. These vaccine candidates showed good responses and protective effects in murine models, but they generally failed during human trials. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of 97 kDa recombinant nucleoporin-93 of Leishmania donovani (rLdNUP93) on mononuclear cells in healthy and treated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients and on THP-1 cell lines. rLd-NUP93 stimulation increased the expression of the early lymphocyte activation marker CD69 on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The expression of the host protective pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-12 and TNF-alpha was increased, with a corresponding down-regulation of IL-10 and TGF-beta upon rLd-NUP93 stimulation. This immune polarization resulted in the up-regulation of NF-kappa B p50 with scant expression of SMAD-4. Augmenting lymphocyte proliferation upon priming with rLd-NUP93 ensured its potential for activation and generation of strong T-cell mediated immune responses. This stimulation extended the leishmanicidal activity of macrophages by releasing high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further, the leishmanicidal activity of macrophages was intensified by the elevated production of nitric oxide (NO). The fact that this antigen was earlier reported in circulating immune complexes of VL patients highlights its antigenic importance. In addition, in silico analysis suggested the presence of MHC class I and II-restricted epitopes that proficiently trigger CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells, respectively. This study reported that rLd-NUP93 was an effective immunoprophylactic agent that can be explored in future vaccine design.

AB Several studies have demonstrated the relationship between visfatin and increased risk of diseases caused by inflammation, however, the relationship between visfatin and coronary artery ectasia (CAE) is still unknown. The aim of our study is to investigate the association between serum visfatin with presence of coronary ectasia and its severity. We enrolled 85 individuals including 35 CAE patients (mean age: 58.40 9.82 years) and 50 control persons (mean age: 53.24 8.81 years). These participants underwent some biochemical tests including visfatin, fasting blood glucose and lipid profiles. In univariate analysis, the serum level of visfatin was significantly associated with ectasia in all patients with CAE and CAD coexisting with CAE groups, but a trend toward significance in isolated CAE group. In multivariate analysis, visfatin showed independently significant association with presence of ectasia in all patients with ectasia and in CAD coexisting with ectasia groups, but not significant in isolated CAE group. Visfatin was also independently associated with severity of ectasia according to MARKIS classification. We conclude that visfatin independently can be the useful predictor for the presence and severity of coronary ectasia.

AB IL-35 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is largely synthesized by regulatory T (Treg) cells and may inhibit antitumor immune responses. This investigation aimed to determine the serum IL-35 concentrations and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in position of rs3761548, within the promoter region of FOXP3 gene, in patients with prostate cancer (PC). The blood specimens were obtained from 150 PC patients prior to using radiation therapy, chemo- or immunotherapy and 150 age-matched healthy men as a control group. The serum IL-35 concentrations and the pattern of genetic variation at position of rs3761548 were assessed using ELISA and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP), respectively. The mean serum IL-35 concentrations were significantly higher in PC patients when compared with healthy control group (20.01 +/- 7.03 Pg/mL vs. 11.60 +/- 2.49 Pg/mL, P < 0.001). The serum IL-35 concentrations raised with progression of PC stages so that there was a significant difference between PC stages concerning the IL-35 concentrations (P < 0.001). The mean serum IL-35 concentrations in patients with Gleason scores of 1-6 and Gleason scores 7-10 were significantly higher as compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001). Moreover, the serum IL-35 concentrations in patients with having Gleason scores of 7-10 were significantly higher as compared with patients with Gleason scores of 1-6 (P < 0.001). Evaluation of the genetic variations in position SNP rs3761548 revealed that the AA genotype and A allele were more prevalent whereas CC genotype and C allele were less prevalent in PC patients when compared with healthy men (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, P < 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively). The AA genotype and A allele were associated with higher risk of PC incidence [OR: 2.42 (95% CI: 1.179-4.99); P < 0.001 and OR: 1.732 (95% CI: 1.244 2.413); P < 0.001, respectively]. The mean serum IL-35 concentrations were significantly higher in total subjects (PC patients + healthy individuals) with AA genotype and A allele than individuals with CC genotype and C allele at SNP rs3761548 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Higher serum IL-35 concentrations observed in patients with PC that were increased with progressive tumor stages. These findings indicate that the IL-35 is possibly involve in tumor progression. Moreover, SNP rs3761548 may affect the susceptibility to PC and the serum IL-35 concentrations.

AB Cytokines and growth factors are signaling proteins involved in communication processes between cells. They are involved in the control of numerous essential physiological processes such as cell proliferation, gene transcription and differentiation; therefore being in the focus of basic and applied research. Many of them are also of relevance for human diseases. When observed as potential targets for pharmacological intervention and objects of structure/function studies, it is important to measure their biological activities, optionally along with potential inhibitors, in a convenient and rational manner. Such tests are frequently laborious to set up and their establishment is complicated by the necessity to employ problematic cell types and sophisticated assays. Here we present a robust and modular activity assay system which can be adapted to virtually all ligands that signal through dimerization of membrane receptors from different families. The technique rests on fusing ligandbinding domains of specific receptors to the transmembrane and intracellular components of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor which translates signals into readily quantifiable luciferase expression in reporter cells. We show that the activation of various hematopoietic cytokine receptors, of receptor tyrosine kinases as well as of receptors bearing serine/threonine kinase domains by their respective ligands was faithfully reflected both upon transient and stable introduction of hybrid receptor and reporter gene constructs into the murine pro B cell line Ba/F3. Moreover, we demonstrate the suitability of this platform for the functional characterization of cytokine/growth factor receptor inhibitors.

AB Human macrophages produce vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) for angiogenesis in diabetic retinopathy (DR). The regulatory function of IL-27 on human macrophages is not well understood. In particular, the effect of IL-27 on VEGFA response in human macrophages has not been investigated. We find that IL-27 suppresses VEGFA mRNA expression as well as protein secretion by human macrophages. The synergistic action of purinergic signaling and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) induces VEGFA production in a positive feedback loop. IL-27 signaling in human macrophages disrupts this positive feedback loop thus suppresses VEGFA production. Blockade of IL-27 signaling with a JAK2 antagonist reverses this downregulatory effect on HIF-la and partially blocks the inhibitory effect on VEGFA production. Lastly, DR patient macrophages have a higher propensity to produce VEGFA and this is amplified by an in vitro challenge with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta suppresses VEGFA production by DR patient macrophages even in the presence of IL-1 beta challenge indicating a potential therapeutic use of IL-27 in the clinic.

AB The role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in pathological states of energy homeostasis and impaired adipocyte function, such as obesity has been a major area of research interest in recent years. Herein, we sought to determine the direct effects of adipokines, visfatin and leptin on BAT thermogenesis.
   The effects of mouse recombinant visfatin, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and leptin with or without FK866 were studied on differentiated T37i cells. Treated cells were analyzed for key genes and proteins regulating BAT [UCP-1, PRD1-BF1-RIZ1 homologous domain-containing 16 (PRDM-16), PPARgamma-coactivator1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) and receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP-140)] using quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Data is presented as mean P-values.
   Both visfatin and leptin had significant concentration dependent effects on thermogenesis in brown preadipocytes and at physiological levels, increased uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) levels in brown adipocytes. These effects of visfatin were similar to that of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), further strengthening the enzymatic role of visfatin. We also showed that leptin induced UCP-1 mRNA expression and protein production appears to be mediated by visfatin. High concentrations of both visfatin and leptin led to a dramatic decrease in UCP-1 protein levels, supporting the notion that visfatin levels are raised in obesity and that obese people have reduced BAT activity, plausibly through a reduction in UCP-1 levels. Additionally, we found differential regulation of key brown adipogenic genes, specifically, PRD1-BF1-RIZ1 homologous domain-containing 16 (PRDM16), PPARgamma-coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1a) and receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP-140) by visfatin. Our observations provide novel insights in the potential actions of visfatin in BAT.

AB Psychological stress is known to have profound effects on immune function and to promote inflammatory conditions. Elevated circulating levels of cytokines associated with stress are known to increase the risk to several diseases, but little is known about this mechanism. This study assessed the role of T cells on cytokine levels after exposure to stress in the learned helplessness paradigm. Adoptive transfer of CD4(+) T cells into Rag2(-/-) mice did not change cytokine levels to stress while CD8(+) T cells resulted in an increase in TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma in stressed Rag2(-/-) mice. Moreover, depletion of CD8(+) T cells in WT mice abolished these cytokine responses to stress. Corticosterone and behavioral stress responsiveness was impaired in Rag2(-/-) mice reconstituted with CD8(+) T cells. Notably, depletion of these cells in WT mice had no effect on behavior or corticosterone levels. Exposure to stress did not change the expression of canonical markers of T cell activation including CD62L and CD44 or modified intracellular cytokine content, suggesting that they are not the main producers of circulating cytokines in response to stress. These results show that CD8(+) T cells promote TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma responses to stress, possibly by stimulating non-lymphoid cells.

AB Purpose: To determine the prognostic value of intrafollicular concentrations of some cytokines from women undergoing ovarian stimulation in the outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection/embryo transfer (ICSI/ET) cycles.
   Methods: A total of 80 patients were included in this study following ovarian stimulation and ICSI. Follicular fluids (FF) were collected at the day of oocyte retrieval. Ten cytokines including: tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-a), interleukin (IL)-1p, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon gamma (IFN-y) were measured using magnetic multiplex immunoassays.
   Results: Only the concentration of IL-5, IL-4, and GM-CSF in FF were significantly different (p < 0.05) between ICSI cycles that resulted in pregnancy and those that failed. Elevated FF IL-5 levels were associated with poor oocyte quality, which decreases the chance of both biochemical and clinical pregnancy. Higher FF GM-CSF associated with decrease of mature oocytes, while higher FF IL-4 concentrations were linked to good ICSI outcome through increased fertilization rate.
   Conclusions: The elevated intrafollicular concentrations of IL-5 seem to be a negative predictor to the pregnancy outcome in ICSI cycles.

AB Background: The serum cytokine levels among 45 mechanically ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU)-treated severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) patients with known microbial etiology in three different etiology groups were assessed.
   Methods: Blood samples for C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, IL-10, human interferon gamma induced protein (IP)-10, and TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha) were collected at time points 0, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after study inclusion.
   Results: There were 21 (43%) pure bacterial infections (bacterial group, BG), 5 (10%) pure viral infections (viral group, VG), and 19 (39%) mixed bacterial-viral infections (mixed group, MG) among 45 mechanically ventilated SCAP patients. CRP and PCT levels were significantly higher in the MG and values decreased with time in all groups. PCT differed also in time and group analysis (P = 0.001), the highest being in the MG. IL-5 levels were significantly higher in the VG compared to others (P-time = 0.001, P-group = 0.051 and P-timeexgroup = 0.016). IL-6 and IP-10 levels decreased over time (P-time = 0.003 and P-time = 0.021), but there were no differences between groups.
   Conclusion: SCAP patients with viral etiology have higher IL-5 levels. Patients with mixed viral and bacterial group have higher PCT compared to other etiologies.

AB Purpose: This study examined the acute effects of a single session of Whole-body Cryotherapy (WBC) following severe intermittent running exercise on biomarkers of inflammation, muscle damage and stress.
   Methods: Endurance-trained males (n = 11) were tested twice using a within-participant, balanced cross-over design that consisted of 5 x 5 min of high-intensity running (HIR) followed by either 3 min of WBC at -110 degrees C or a passive control condition (CON). Before the HIR and after 60 min of recovery a ramp-test was completed. At seven time points up to 24 hrs post exercise venous blood samples were analyzed for serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), c-reactive protein (CRP), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), myoglobin, cortisol, and testosterone.
   Results: HIR induced significant increases in all biomarkers except sICAM-1 in both recovery conditions, respectively. Compared to the CON condition WBC did not attenuate exercise- induced changes in IL-6, IL-10, sICAM-1, myoglobin, cortisol, testosterone or their ratio. Increased levels of cortisol following exercise were negatively correlated with subsequent running performance in both conditions (WBC: r = 0.61, p = 0.04; CON: r = 0.64, p = 0.04).
   Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the postulated physiological mechanisms by which WBC is proposed to improve recovery, i.e. reductions in inflammation and muscle damage, may not be accurate.

AB This study investigated the efficacy of the vaccine in liver of mice infected with the Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and immunized with AdASP-2. For this purpose, histopathological analysis and gene expression of COX-2, TNFalpha, TNFR, iNOS, cytochrome C, caspase-3, TLR4, IL-6 and IL10 were evaluated. The following groups were used in this study: Group 1- Control Group (CTRL) animals received Adj3Gal vehicle; Group 2- Infected Group (TC) animals were infected with T. cruzi; Group 3- Immunized Group (AdASP-2): animals were immunized by AdASP-2 vaccine; Group 4- Immunized and Infected Group (AdASP-2 + TC) animals were infected with T. cruzi and immunized by AdSP-2 vaccine. A significant decrease of amastigote nests was noticed in the group of animals that were immunized with AdASP-2 and infected on the same day. COX-2 and TNF-alpha gene expressions increased in TC group, whereas TNF-alpha decreased in the TC + AdASP-2 group. TNFR expression was high in AdASP-2 + TC group. iNOS expression was high for all experimental groups whereas cytochrome C decreased for all experimental groups. Caspase 3 increased in TC and TC + AdASP-2 groups. The gene expression of TLR4 and IL-10 showed an increase in AdASP-2 + TC group. Finally, hepatic fibrosis was noticed to TC and AdASP-2 + TC groups. Taken together, our results demonstrated that vaccination with AdASP-2 was effective against the acute phase of experimental Chagas disease as a result of a more powerful and rapid immune response closely related to expression of some inflammatory genes, such as iNOS, TNF-alpha, TLR 4, and IL-10.

AB The study aimed to determine whether circulating spexin (SPX) is modified during the course of pregnancy and whether it is affected by the presence of glucose intolerance, i.e., Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). This prospective study included 102 pregnant women (63 non-GDM and 39 GDM; mean age 29.4 +/- 5.1 years; mean BMI 28.0 +/- 6.1 kg/m(2)). Anthropometrics, glycemic and lipid profiles, as well measurements of circulating adipocytokines and SPX were measured at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. In GDM patients, SPX levels increased significantly after 6-months, in parallel with a borderline significant increase in glucose (p = 0.07). In non-GDM patients, however, median SPX level decreased from baseline to 6-months (p < 0.01), and this change was not associated with changes in glucose levels. Change in glucose from baseline to 6-months was positively associated with change in SPX in GDM patients only (R = 0.37; p < 0.05). SPX levels are positively influenced by glucose intolerance in pregnant women with GDM, while they decrease in control women without GDM.

AB Interleukin-7 (IL-7) mediated signals are linked to development, proliferation, survival and differentiation of cells. Recent evidences indicate its role in oocyte maturation process as well. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of IL-7 involvement in oocyte maturation are not well characterized. In addition, currently no information is available on the effect of exogenous IL-7 on oocyte maturation in ovine or any other species. In this study, the effect of IL-7 supplementation during in vitro maturation (IVM) on the maturation rate, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gene expression of ovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) was assessed. IL-7 (0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 ng/ml) was supplemented in IVM medium at the beginning (0 h) and maturation rate of COC was assessed at the completion of IVM (24 h). The maturation rate (%) was found significantly (P = 0.000) greater with the 1 ng/ml of IL-7 supplementation (69.5) than control (60.0). In contrast, the maturation rate was reduced significantly (P = 0.000) with the 2 (47.1), 5 (39.2) and 10 ng/ml (39.1) of IL-7 as compared to the control. The level of intracellular ROS in the matured COC was found considerably higher with the 5 ng/ml of IL 7 followed by 1 ng/ml of IL-7 and control. It was evident that in the presence of superoxide dismutase-inhibitor, 1 ng/ml of IL-7 did not stimulate oocyte maturation. In contrast, oocyte maturation was improved with 5 ng/ml of IL-7 supplementation in the presence of NADPH-oxidase-inhibitor. IL-7 supplementation influenced gene expression in COC in a dose and time dependant manner. The expression of genes related to ROS production and apoptosis were upregulated and the genes associated with antioxidant mechanisms were downregulated noticeably with the supplementation of 5 ng/ml of IL-7. In conclusion, IL-7 at low concentration was beneficial for oocyte maturation, which was likely mediated through the favourable level of intracellular ROS and antioxidant mechanisms. In contrast, the detrimental effects of greater IL-7 concentrations on oocyte maturation were possibly arbitrated through the ROS-mediated oxidative stress, compromised antioxidant mechanism and stimulated apoptotic signalling.

AB Objective: To assess the association between serum levels of IL-37 in rheumatoid arthritis patients and percentage of peripheral blood T lymphocytes expressing the activation marker CD26 and investigate their correlation with disease activity.
   Methods: The study included 48 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 42 age and sex matched healthy controls. Serum levels of IL-37 were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay while percentage of CD3(+)CD26(+)T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assayed using flowcytometry.
   Results: Serum levels of IL-37, as well as the percentage of CD3(+)CD26(+)T cells, were significantly higher in rheumatoid arthritis patients than in healthy controls. Also, serum IL-37 levels were higher in patients with severe disease activity than patients with moderate and low disease activity. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, both serum levels of IL-37 and percentage of CD3(+)CD26(+)T cells correlated with disease activity (DAS28), C reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition, serum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 positively correlated with the percentage of CD3(+)CD26(+)T cells in peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis patients.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate a strong correlation between serum levels of IL-37 and frequency of activated T cells in peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Our results suggest that in an active disease status, activated T lymphocytes may be a contributing source to the elevated levels of IL-37 trying to down-regulate the active inflammatory process.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of carvacrol on serum levels of interleukins (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10), interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) levels and pulmonary function tests (PFT) in patients who were exposed to sulfur mustard (SM).
   Methods: Twenty patients exposed to SM 27-30 years ago were divided to placebo and carvacrol (1.2 mg/kg/ day) treated groups (n = 10 for each group). Drugs were given in a double-blind manner for two months. Serum levels of cytokines and PFT values including; maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) and maximum expiratory flow at 25, 50 and 75% of vital capacity (MEF25, 50 and 75) were measured at the beginning (step 0), one and two month (steps I and II, respectively) after starting the treatment.
   Results: The serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly decreased in step I and II compared to step 0 (p < 0.05 top < 0.001), while the serum levels of IL-10 and IFNy were increased in step II compared to step 0 (p < 0.01, for both cases) and IFN-y/IL-4 ratio was enhanced in step II compared to step 0 (p < 0.001) in carvacrol treated group. MMEF, MEF75, and 50 values were significant increase in step I and II compared to step 0 (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001) in carvacrol treated group.
   Conclusion: Treatment with carvacrol for two months reduced inflammatory cytokine, while increased antiinflammatory cytokines and improved PFT tests in SM induced lung injury.

AB This study was aimed to elucidate the immunoregulatory properties of human cardiac fibroblasts cultured under pro-inflammatory and hypoxic conditions. Human heart tissue for isolating cardiac cells is generally hard to obtain, particularly from all four chambers of the same heart. Since different parts of the heart have different functions and therefore may have different immunoregulatory properties, ability to analyse cells from all chambers allows for a unique and comprehensive investigation.
   Cells were isolated from all four chambers of the heart from patients undergoing cardiac transplantation surgery due to severe chronic heart failure (CHF) (n = 6). Cells isolated from one donor heart, were used for comparison with the experimental group. Primary cultured human cardiac fibroblasts were treated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an inflammatory response. Cells were also subjected to hypoxia. To determine immunoregulatory properties of the cells, cytokine and chemokine profiles were determined using multiplex ELISA Results: On average, the fibroblasts population constituted approximately 90% of the expanded non-myocytes. Levels of cytokines and chemokines were markedly increased in human cardiac fibroblasts cultured under inflammatory conditions, with a similar response in fibroblasts from all compartments of the heart. Unexpectedly, hypoxia did not further augment cytokine and chemokine secretion.
   In conclusion, human cardiac fibroblasts are a robust source of pro-inflammatory mediators in the failing heart, independent of hypoxia, and might play a critical role in inflammation associated with the pathogenesis of CHF.

AB Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Atherosclerosis as the main underlying mechanism of CAD is associated with inflammation and adipose tissue dysfunction. Clq/TNF-related proteinl2 (CTRP12) is a newly discovered adipokine which is a paralog of adiponectin. CTRP12 has anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizing effects. Circulating levels of this adipokine have been reported to be lower in patients with type 2 diabetes and women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The present study was undertaken for the first time to evaluate serum levels of CTRP12 in CAD patients and its association with anthropometric and biochemical parameters.
   Serum levels of CTRP12 were measured using ELISA kit in 188 CAD patients (angiography confirmed) and 70 controls. The serum levels of adiponectin, TNF-a and IL-6 were measured using ELISA kits. Serum levels of CTRP12 were found to be lower in CAD patients (585.48 +/- 201.67 pg/mL) than in the controls (814.86 +/- 247.85 pg/mL; p < 0.001). CTRP12 also showed an independent association with the risk of CAD (OR [CI] = 0.998 [0.996-0.999]; p = 0.019). Moreover, it showed an inverse correlation with HOMA-IR (r = 0.298; p = 0.012) and TNF-a (r = 0.269; p = 0.023) and a positive correlation with adiponectin (r = 0.344; p = 0.003) in the controls. In CAD patients, CTRP12 was inversely correlated with BMI (r = 0.181, p = 0.013), HOMA-IR (r =-0.199; p = 0.006), TNF-a alpha (r =-0.259; p < 0.001) and IL-6 (r =-320; p < 0.001) and a positive correlation with high density lipoprotein-cholesterol(r = 0.342; p < 0.001) and adiponectin (r = 0.398; p < 0.001).
   The present study showed for the first time that serum levels of CTRP12 are independently associated with CAD and that CTRP12 is associated with several CAD risk factors. The results suggest a possible link between CTRP12 and pathogenic mechanisms of atherosclerosis, such as inflammation and high density lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism; however, more study is required in this regard.

AB Background: In presented study the amino acid analysis was performed in serum derived from rheumatoid arthritis patients (RA) according to undertaken therapy and classification of physical disability. The results were compared with previously published data.
   Methods: The levels of 31 free amino acids were determined in 50 serum samples derived from RA subjects and 51 controls. The RA patients were divided into two groups according to the therapy (methotrexate/leflunomide, infliximab/adalimumab/etanercept/tocilizumab, prednisolone/NSAID) and classification of physical disability of the patients. Levels of amino acids were measured by LC-MS/MS. The obtained results were subjected to multivariate statistical tests.
   Results: According to the therapy that was being used, threonine differentiated RA patients treated with methotrexate/leflunomide- infliximab/adalimumab/etanercept/tocilizumab (p = 0.00954) and infliximab/ adalimumab/etanercept/tocilizumab- prednisolone/NSAID (p = 0.03109), while tryptophan differentiated RA patients treated with methotrexate/leflunomide- infliximab/adalimumab/etanercept/tocilizumab (p = 0.01723). In the functional classification, arginine differentiated RA samples between class III and IV (p = 0.02332), while glycine differentiated them between class I + II and III of the Steinbrocker functional classification (p = 0.03366).
   Conclusions: An analysis of the metabolome profile requires the use of validated bioanalytical methods that are strictly dedicated for this purpose. The obtained results are not accidental (p value less than 0.05), and all of the selected amino acids play an important role in inflammation and immune response. It is suggested that studied amino acids can be considered as a markers for diagnosis of RA and monitoring pharmacotherapy of the disease.

AB Background: Inhibiting TNF-alpha is an effective therapy for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, systemic, nondiscriminatory neutralization of TNF-alpha is associated with considerable adverse effects.
   Methods: Here, we developed a trimeric chimeric TNF receptor by linking an N-terminal mouse Acrp30 trimerization domain and an MMP-2/9 substrate sequence to the mouse extracellular domain of TNF receptor 2 followed by a C-terminal mouse tetranectin coiled-coil domain (mouse Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn).
   Results: Here, we show that the Acrp30 trimerization domain inhibited the binding activity of TNFR, possibly by closing the binding site of the trimeric receptor. Cleavage of the substrate sequence by MMP-9, an enzyme highly expressed in inflammatory sites, restored the binding activity of the mouse TNF receptor. We also constructed a recombinant human chimeric TNF receptor (human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn) in which an MMP-13 substrate sequence was used to link the human Acrp and the human TNF receptor 2. Human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn showed reduced binding activity, and MMP-13 digestion recovered its binding activity with TNF-alpha.
   Conclusion: Acrp-masked chimeric TNF receptors may be able to be used for inflammatory tissue-selective neutralization of TNF-alpha to reduce the adverse effects associated with systemic neutralization of TNF-alpha.

AB Introduction: In the present study, the effects of aminoguanidine (AMG) on hippocampal cytokines, amyloid beta (A beta), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, oxidative stress status and memory in chronically lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated rats were investigated.
   Methods: The rats were divided into five groups and were treated: (1) Control (Saline), (2) LPS (1 mg/kg), (3-5) LPS- AMG50, LPS-AMG100, and LPS-AMG150 (AMG 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg 30 min before LPS injection). The treatment started five weeks prior to the behavioral experiments and continued during the behavioral tests (LPS injection two hours before each behavioral evaluation). Finally, the tissue was removed for biochemical measurements.
   Results: The escape latency in Morris water maze test and the latency to enter the dark compartment in passive avoidance test in LPS group were significantly greater than the control group (P < 0.001), while, in LPS-AMG 100 and LPS-AMG150 groups they were less than LPS group (P < 0.001). Malondialdehyde (MDA), NO metabolites of hippocampal and cortical tissues and interleukin-6 (IL-6), A beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) concentration in the hippocampus of LPS group were higher than control group (P < 0.001-P < 0.05). However, in LPS-AMG 100 and LPS-AMG150 group they were lower than LPS group (P < 0.001-P < 0.05). The thiol content and the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in both cortical and hippocampal tissues of LPS group were reduced compared to the control group (P < 0.001-P < 0.05). These factors enhanced in LPS-AMG 100 and LPS-AMG150 groups compared to LPS (P < 0.001-P < 0.05). The hippocampal content of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in LPS group was significantly lower compared to the control group (P < 0.001). All treated groups had higher BDNF content in comparison to LPS group (P < 0.01-P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The findings indicated that the protective effects of AMG against LPS-induced memory were accompanied by decreasing of inflammatory cytokines, All, oxidative stress and increasing of anti-inflammatory mediators and BDNF.

AB Neuregulin-4 (Nrg4) is a novel adipokine associated with obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dislipidemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress in mice and humans. However, no report has demonstrated the relationship of circulating Nrg4 with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). The objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between circulating Nrg4 and DPN in a cross-sectional study. Circulating Nrg4 levels were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays kit in 132 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (nT2DM) patients and 41 normal controls (NC group). The associations of circulating Nrg4 with other parameters were also analyzed. Circulating Nrg4 levels were significantly lower in nT2DM patients with no DPN than in NC subjects, and were further markedly decreased in nT2DM patients with DPN (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Circulating Nrg4 levels were progressively decreased with an increasing number of abnormal DPN screening (P for trend < 0.01). Circulating Nrg4 levels correlated negatively with 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 alpha (8-iso-PGF(2 alpha)), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and vibration perception threshold (VPT) (all P < 0.01), and 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha), hs-CRP, glycated hemoglobin A1c and VPT were independently related factors to circulating Nrg4 in nT2DM patients (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Moreover, circulating Nrg4 was significantly associated with the development of DPN even after controlling for anthropometric, biochemical and clinical parameters. Additionally, the analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that the best cutoff value for circulating Nrg4 to predict DPN was 1.58 ng/mL (sensitivity 90.91%, specificity 54.55%, and area under the curve 0.716). These findings together suggested that circulating Nrg4 levels were reduced in DPN patients and Nrg4 may be a novel adipokine associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and long-term glycemic control in nT2DM patients.

AB Background Recent studies demonstrated that fractalkine (FKN) is critically involved in the regulation of inflammation and cardiac function. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of circulating FKN in patients with ST-elevated acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) after primary PCI.
   Methods: We enrolled ninety consecutive STEMI patients and investigated the association of circulating FKN with myocardial salvage and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after PCI.
   Results: During a median follow-up of 387 days, total 15 MACE (16.67%) were registered in the study population. Patients with MACE were more likely to be occurred in elderly patients with 3-vessel disease. Correlation analysis demonstrated the level of FKN at day 1 after PCI (FKN@day-1) not only significantly correlated with the levels of hs-TnT at day 7 after PCI (R-2 = 0.06; p = 0.02) but inversely correlated with the measurements of LVEF at 1-month observation (R-2 = 0.10; p = 0.00). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses further revealed that patients with the level of FKN@day-1 above the median had a higher incidence of MACE compared with those whose FKN@day-1 levels below the median (log-rank test x(2) = 13.29, p < 0.001). In addition, multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that FKN@day-1 was an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio: 4.63; 95% confidence interval: 1.53-14.01; p = 0.00), together with WBC count and 3-vessel disease for STEMI patients.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that FKN@day-1 is negative correlated with myocardial salvage after acute myocardial infarction and might be a valuable prognostic marker of MACE in patients with STEMI undergone PCI.

AB To better predict the outcomes of patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), we measured the levels of various cytokines in serum samples from patients with PTCL and analyzed their clinical outcomes. We measured 34 cytokines in samples from 121 PTCL patients (55 PTCL-not otherwise specified (NOS), 44 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), and 22 ALK(-) anaplastic large cell lymphoma) at diagnosis. Their impact on clinical outcomes, including overall survival and complete response rate, were analyzed with other clinical variables. The median age of patients was 58 years (range, 20-85 years) and 81 patients (66.9%) were male. The median overall survival among all patients was 56.1 months (95% CI 21.4-90.8) and median progression-free survival was 19.3 months (95% CI 12.3-26.3). Patients with AITL were more likely to express higher levels of serum cytokines, and 7 cytokines showed mean levels that were significantly higher than those in other subtypes. In this subgroup, IL-10 higher than 3.8 pg/mL was associated with adverse outcomes. In patients with ALK(-) anaplastic large cell lymphoma, 9 cytokines showed a prognostic impact, with higher levels of interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23, IP-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, and RANTES negatively affecting clinical outcomes. In PTCL-NOS, patients with elevated levels of interferon gamma, IL-7, and IL-23 showed poor outcomes. The current analysis demonstrated different cytokine profiles according to histologic subtype, which revealed the heterogeneity of PTCL. In addition, cytokine levels can be used as prognostic markers and may be useful for therapeutic applications in PTCL patients.

AB Introduction: Resveratrol has been reported to alleviate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in mesangial cells and in several types of renal injury in animal models. Previously, the active resveratrol derivatives from the roots of Vitis thunbergii Sieb. & Zucc. (Vitaceae) were shown to have significant anti-platelet and anti oxidative activities. However, the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of these resveratrol derivatives in rat mesangial cells (RMCs) have not been clarified fully.
   Methods: The protective mechanisms of resveratrol derivatives involved in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced inflammatory responses were assessed by Western blot analysis, real-time PCR, and RT-PCR. The involvement of various signaling molecules in these responses was investigated using selective pharmacological inhibitors.
   Results: Nontoxic concentrations of the resveratrol derivatives significantly attenuated cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression in RMCs challenged by TNF-alpha. These resveratrol derivatives inhibited TNF-alpha-activated ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 without affecting p38 phosphorylation. Next, we demonstrated that TNF-alpha induced NF-kappa B activation, translocation, and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with resveratrol derivatives in RMCs.
   Conclusion: The protective mechanisms of resveratrol derivatives against TNF-alpha-stimulated inflammatory responses via cPLA(2)/COX-2/PGE(2) inhibition was caused by the attenuation of the JNK1/2, ERK1/2, and NF-kappa B signaling pathways in RMCs.

AB Purpose: Atherosclerosis is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is known to be an inflammatory process. Statin therapy decreases both cholesterol and inflammation and is used in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, a statin induced decrease of plasma concentrations of the antioxidant coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), may prevent the patients from reaching their optimal anti-inflammatory potential. Here, we studied the anti-inflammatory effect of Simvastatin therapy and CoQ10 supplementation.
   Methods: 35 patients in primary prevention with Simvastatin (40 mg/day) were randomized to receive oral CoQ10 supplementation (400 mg/d) or placebo for 8 weeks. 20 patients with hypercholesterolemia who received no cholesterol-lowering treatment was a control group. Plasma concentrations of lipids and inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-6 (IL6); -8 (IL8); -10 (IL10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha); high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP)) as well as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were quantified before and after the intervention.
   Results: No significant change in inflammatory markers or lipids was observed after CoQ10 supplementation Patients in Simvastatin therapy had significantly (P < 0.05) lower baseline concentration of IL6 (0.31 +/- 0.03 pg/ml), IL8 (1.6 +/- 0.1 pg/ml) IL10 (0.16 +/- 0.02 pg/ml) and borderline (P = 0.053) lower TNF alpha (0.88 +/- 0.05 pg/ml), but not hsCRP (1.34 +/- 0.19 mg/l) compared with the control group (0.62 +/- 0.08, 2.6 +/- 0.2, 0.25 +/- 0.01, 1.07 +/- 0.09, and 1.90 +/- 0.35, respectively).
   Conclusions: Simvastatin therapy has beneficial effects on inflammatory markers in plasma, but CoQ10 supplementation seems to have no additional potentiating effect in patients in primary prevention. In contrast, glucose homeostasis may improve with CoQ10 supplementation.

ID METRELEPTIN TREATMENT; THERAPY; OBESITY
AB Aim Metreleptin treatment in lipodystrophy patients improves eating behavior with increased satiety and reduced hunger. However, no data are available whether effects are maintained beyond 52 weeks of treatment.
   Methods: A prospective study with measurements at baseline and at > 150 weeks of metreleptin treatment was performed. Five female lipodystrophy patients with indication for metreleptin were included. Behavioral aspects of hunger- and satiety regulation were assessed by validated eating behavior questionnaires and visual analog scales assessing hunger and satiety feelings before and after a standardized meal.
   Results: Hunger rated on visual analog scales at 120 min after the meal significantly decreased from 46 +/- 10 mm at baseline to 17 +/- 6 mm at long-term assessment. Furthermore, satiety at 5 and 120 min after the meal significantly increased from baseline to long-term assessment (5 min: 70 +/- 7 mm to 87 +/- 3 mm; 120 min: 43 +/- 10 mm to 79 +/- 8 mm). On the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, the mean value of factor 3 (hunger) significantly decreased from 9.2 +/- 0.2 at baseline to 2.6 +/- 1.5 at long-term assessment. In the Inventory of Eating Behavior and Weight Problems Questionnaire, mean values for scale 2 (strength and triggering of desire to eat) and scale 7 (cognitive restraint of eating) significantly decreased from baseline (31.6 +/- 4.8 and 11.4 +/- 2.2, respectively) to long-term assessment (14.0 +/- 2.1 and 10.0 +/- 1.9).
   Conclusion: First evidence is presented that long-term metreleptin treatment of > 150 weeks has sustained effects on eating behavior with increased satiety, as well as reduced hunger and hunger-related measures.

AB Purpose: Recent studies suggested that the non-familiar form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) could be consequence of metabolic syndrome and neuroinflammation. Elettaria cardamomum extract (EC) has exhibited antidiabetic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This research was conducted to evaluate the effects of EC on AD like alterations in rats induced by high fructose and high fat diet coupled with a single small dose of STZ (25 mg/kg) (T2DM rats).
   Methods: Phytochemical analysis was carried out. Behavioral tests, immunohistochemical examination, biochemical analysis and gene expression determination were performed in treated and controls rats.
   Results: The majority of EC compounds were terpenoids. EC extract administration for 8 weeks attenuated AD like alterations. It reversed a T2DM-induced decline in cognitive functions in passive avoidance task and Morris water maze test. It significantly lowered the elevated hippocampal level of AChE activity and caspase-3 activity, an indicator of degeneration in T2DM rats Also, it reduced the accumulation of A beta and p-tau in the brain of T2DM rats. Furthermore, it elevated the suppressed glutamate receptor expression (AMPA GluR1 subunit and NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, NR2B). EC treatment reduced hippocampal lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) and augmented antioxidant defensive system, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH). Meanwhile, it lowered hippocampal TNF alpha, IL beta 1but not IL6 and reduced GSK-3 beta in brainT2D rats.
   Conclusion: EC treatment could ameliorate AD-like alterations in T2DM rats through activation of blunted insulin signal transduction in the brain, attenuation of associated oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in which both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration play critical roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. A growing body of evidence indicates that some antibiotics have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Rifampicin, commonly used for the treatment of mycobacteria, has been shown to exert neuroprotective activities in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined the efficacy of rifampicin on demyelination, gliosis, apoptosis, inflammation, behavioral dysfunction, and biochemical alterations in the cuprizone model of demyelination. For this aim, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a chow containing 0.2% cuprizone (w/w) for 6 weeks to induce reversible demyelination in the corpus callosum. Mice intraperitoneally received serial doses of rifampicin (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg body weight) in the last 7 days of a 6-week period of cuprizone treatment. The results showed that the administration of rifampicin led to the improvement in motor behavioral deficits. In line with this, rifampicin decreased the number of apoptotic cells in the corpus callosum thereby diminishing the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, as well as increasing Bcl-2. Moreover, rifampicin significantly lowered the levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, caspase-12 activity, heme oxygenase-1(HO-1), nitric oxide (NO), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mice treated with cuprizone. Conversely, the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the level of ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were increased in response to the treatment with rifampicin. Histopathological findings demonstrated that rifampicin statistically promoted remyelination and mitigated microgliosis and astrogliosis. It seems that rifampicin is able to be added to the armamentarium of therapies for multiple sclerosis.

TI Hsp90 inhibitors suppress P53 phosphorylation in LPS - induced

AB P53 has been recently involved in the defense against inflammation. The "guardian of the genome" appears to orchestrate cellular responses against bacterial toxins, by regulating crucial pathways that orchestrate the vascular barrier functions. Indeed, an emerging body of evidence suggests that this tumor suppressor is involved in the mediation of the beneficial effects of Hsp90 inhibition in the inflamed endothelium. Interestingly, those compounds augment the abundance of P53 in the intracellular niche, while LPS dramatically reduces it. The current study focuses on the outcome of LPS and Hsp90 inhibition on P53 phosphorylation, since this modification negatively affects P53 stability. In an in "vitro" model of LPS - induced vascular leak in bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, LPS induced P53 phosphorylation in four distinct residues, namely Ser. 6, Ser. 15, Ser. 33 and Ser. 392. Furthermore, LPS triggered the activation of the myosin light chain 2, which produces endothelial barrier dysfunction by cellular retraction and intercellular gap formation. Indeed, mice exposed to the toxin demonstrated elevated levels of the pro - inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IL-10 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In bold contrast, the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG, counteracted the LPS - induced effects both in vivo and in vitro. Specifically, this hsp90 inhibitor reduced phosphorylated P53 levels and lessened the activation of myosin light chain 2 (phosphorylation) in the bovine endothelium. Moreover, 17 - DMAG suppressed inflammation in mouse lungs, as reflected in reduced IL-2 and IL-10 BALF levels. In summary, the present results support previous observations on the protective role of P53 against inflammation and clarify mechanisms that govern vascular barrier function.

AB Background: The combination of local and systemic factors play role in the pathogenesis of periodontal and peri-implant diseases. Host-derived enzymes, cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators play an integral role in this destruction. The aim of this study is to evaluate gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and peri-implant crevicular (PICF) fluid levels of sclerostin, TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin OPG in periodontal and peri-implant tissues in disease and health conditions and also to assess the potential for use as biomarkers.
   Materials and methods: The study population was consisted of 50 women and 41 men, in the total of 91 individuals, with a mean age of 51.84 +/- 14.05. Periodontitis (n = 22), periodontal health (n = 17), peri-implantitis (n = 27) and peri-implant health (n = 25) groups were established according to clinical and radiographic examination results of 39 teeth and 52 implants restored with fixed prosthetic restorations. In all groups, periodontal and peri-implant parameters (probing depth, gingival recession, gingival bleeding time index, gingival index, and plaque index) were recorded and GCF and PICF samples were also collected. Sclerostin, TWEAK, RANKL and OPG levels in GCF and PICF were measured with ELISA tests.
   Results: Peri-implantitis group presented significantly higher levels of Sclerostin (p = 0.002), TWEAK (p < 0.0001), RANKL(p < 0.0001), and OPG (p = 0.037) compared to peri-implant health group. Similarly, significantly higher levels of TWEAK (p = 0.001), RANKL(p < 0.0001), and OPG(p = 0.025) were detected in periodontitis group when compared to periodontal health group. Statistically significant correlations were also noted between biochemical parameters and clinical parameters.
   Conclusion: Findings of this study evaluating four different bone metabolism related proteins at the same time, suggests levels of sclerostin may be a biomarker for peri-implant disease presenting significantly higher levels in the peri-implantitis group than in the peri-implant health group. Moreover, levels of TWEAK can be a good indicator for both periodontal and peri-implant disease, due to the correlations with periodontal clinical parameters and the higher levels of TWEAK in diseased sites compared to the healthy sites for both dental implants and teeth.

AB Introduction: The presence of esophageal varices in liver cirrhosis indicates clinically significant portal hypertension (PH), that results from structural and dynamic changes in the liver and systemic circulation including the activation of several fibrotic and inflammatory pathways. We assessed if interleukin-18 (IL-18) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) serum levels can be used as PH markers and reflect its severity.
   Material and methods: IL-18 and TGF-beta 1 peripheral blood levels were analyzed in 83 cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices compared to healthy individuals, in relation to MELD and Child-Pugh scores, laboratory and Doppler ultrasound parameters, and non-selective beta-blocker therapy (NSBB).
   Results: IL-18 concentration was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients, while TGF-beta 1 concentration was lower than in controls. MELD score correlated positively with IL-18 levels and negatively with TGF-beta 1 levels. IL-18 levels correlated positively with bilirubin, INR, ALT and AST levels, and negatively with albumin levels and erythrocyte count. TGF-beta 1 levels correlated positively with platelet count, leukocyte, and erythrocyte count, and negatively with bilirubin levels and prothrombin time. Moreover, significant correlations were found: between IL and 18 levels and portal, mesenteric superior, and splenic vein velocity, and between TGF-beta 1 levels and splenic vein diameter and spleen size. In a subgroup of patients, IL-18 levels significantly decreased after NSBB.
   Conclusion: The observed imbalance of peripheral IL-18 and TGF-beta 1 levels indicates clinically significant PH associated with the presence of esophageal varices in cirrhosis. The correlation of IL-18 levels with liver failure indicators and decrease with NSBB suggest an important role of IL-18 in disease progression and its potential use as noninvasive test for PH assessment.

AB Type I interferonopathies are characterized by an increase of circulating type I interferon (IFN) concentration. Type I interferonopathies refer to rare Mendelian genetic disorders such as Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) as well as more frequent and polygenic auto-immune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Yet, detection of type I IFN in these patients remains challenging as its amount is usually very low in patients' sera. Thus, the detection of interferon-stimulating genes has been proposed as an alternative for the detection of this cytokine but sensitivy, specificity and predictive values of the assay have not been reported so far. In this study, we propose two different methods based on Nanostring or RT-qPCR to measure in the clinical routine the IFN response, defined as a set of transcripts that are systemically induced by IFNs. The IFN signature is composed of 6 IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) and has a strong predictive value for the diagnosis of type I interferonopathies. The use of this simple test might represent a gold standard for the evaluation of various autoimmune diseases. Moreover, this test could also be used to monitor patients treated with drugs targeting type I IFN pathway. When comparing both methods - Nanostring and qPCR - in terms of analytical performance, they provided similar results but Nanostring was quicker, easier to multiplex, and almost fully-automated, which represent a more reliable assay for the daily clinical practice.

ID ASSAYS; BLOOD
AB Quantification of analytes such as cytokines in serum samples is intrinsic to translational research in immune diseases. Optimising pre-analytical conditions is critical for ensuring study quality, including evaluation of cytokine stability. We aimed to evaluate the effect on cytokine stability of storage duration prior to freezing of serum, and compare to plasma samples obtained from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Protein stability was analysed by simultaneously quantifying 18 analytes using a custom multi-analyte profile in SLE patient serum and plasma samples that had been prospectively stored at 4 degrees C for pre-determined periods between 0 and 30 days, prior to freezing. Six analytes were excluded from analysis, because most tested samples were above or below the limit of detection. Amongst the 12 analysed proteins, 11 did not show significant signal degradation. Significant signal degradation was observed from the fourth day of storage for a single analyte, CCL19. Proteins levels were more stable in unseparated serum compared to plasma for most analytes, with the exception of IL-37 which appears slightly more stable in plasma. Based on this, a maximum 3 days of storage at 4 degrees C for unseparated serum samples is recommended for biobanked samples intended for cytokine analysis in studies of human immune disease.

AB Chlamydia trachomatis infection (chlamydia) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial infection and causes significant reproductive morbidity in women. Little is known about how immunity to chlamydia develops in women, though animal models of chlamydia indicate that T-helper type 1 (Th1) responses are important for chlamydia clearance and protective immunity, whereas T-helper type 2 (Th2) responses are associated with persisting infection. In chlamydia-infected women, whether the predominant immune response is Th1- or Th2-polarizing remains controversial. To determine the cytokine profiles elicited by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from chlamydia-infected women, we stimulated PBMCs with C. trachomatis elementary bodies and recombinant C. trachomatis Pgp3 and measured supernatant levels of select cytokines spanning Th1- and Th2-polarizing responses. We found that stimulated PBMCs from chlamydia-infected women secreted cytokines that indicate strong Th1-polarizing responses, especially interferon-gamma, whereas Th2-polarizing cytokines were expressed at significantly lower levels. In chlamydia-infected women, the predominant cytokine responses elicited on stimulation of PBMCs with C. trachomatis antigens were Th1-polarizing, with interferon-gamma as the predominant cytokine.

ID DIFFERENTIATION
AB The alarmin family members S100A8 and S100A9 are acute phase inflammation proteins, but they also have been proposed as biomarkers in many malignant and non-malignant diseases. In this study, circulating S100A8 and S100A9 homodimers and S100A8/A9 heterodimers in plasma were systematically investigated by ELISA in aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Plasma was obtained from 58 severe AA (SAA) and 30 MDS patients, and from 47 age- and sex-matched healthy donors. In 40 out of the 58 AA subjects, S100A protein levels were measured before and 6 months after immunosuppressive therapy (IST). No differences were observed in AA patients at diagnosis compared to healthy controls for circulating S100A homodimers and heterodimers. After therapy, SAA-responders showed significantly increased circulating S100A8. Non-responding patients had significantly higher levels of circulating S100A8/A9 compared to responders and healthy controls, but without variations of S100A8 and S100A9 homodimers. In MDS patients, circulating S100A8 was significantly elevated compared to those of AA and/or healthy controls. By Pearson correlation analysis of protein levels and blood counts, multiple correlations were found. However, as S100A8 and S100A9 are abundantly present in white blood cells and platelets, correlations with blood counts likely mirror the higher number of cells in the blood of some patients. In conclusion, our findings indicate that circulating S100A8 is increased in MDS but not in AA, and that may be useful to distinguish these diseases in the differential diagnosis of bone marrow failure syndromes.

AB CD46 is an important immune regulatory receptor with dual functions, however, the CD46 isoform distribution and the effect of CD46 activation on the cytokine production in monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) is unclear. Here, we show that CD46 activation of moDCs downregulates LPS-induced CXCL-10 expression, while the expression of CXCL-10 in monocytes is unaffected. Furthermore, the differentiation of moDCs induces a switch towards dominance of CYT-2 isoforms of CD46. These data indicate that CD46 activation exerts different functions in monocytes and moDCs and this correlates with a switch in CD46 isoform expression upon differentiation of moDCs.

AB Interleukin (IL)-22 plays a critical role in regulating the maintenance of the mucosal barrier. As airway epithelial regeneration is abnormal in cystic fibrosis (CF), we investigated IL-22 integrity in CF. We first demonstrated, using Il-22-/- mice, that IL-22 is important to prevent lung damage induced by the CF pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Next, IL-22 receptor was found normally expressed at the airway epithelial surfaces of CF patients. In wound-healing assays, IL-22-treated CF cultures had higher wound-closure rate than controls, suggesting that IL 22 signaling per se could be functional in a CF context. However, persistence of neutrophil-derived serine-proteases is a major feature of CF airways. Remarkably, IL-22 was found altered in this protease-rich inflammatory microenvironment; the serine protease-3 being the most prone to fully degrade IL-22. Consequently, we suspect an acquired deficiency of the IL-22 pathway in the lungs of CF patients due to IL-22 cleavage by the surrounding neutrophil serine-proteases.

AB In recent decades, urbanization has led to more frequent flood events in urban areas. Several studies have shown the promise of green roof technology for storm water reduction. However, limited studies have assessed water retention performance of green roofs in a range of climates. To investigate the retention performance of a green roof in various Canadian climates, several cities across the country (Vancouver, Calgary, Regina, Toronto, London, and Halifax) were selected. The water balance equation along with evapotranspiration (ET) models were employed to simulate runoff produced by green roofs in these six Canadian cities for two different vegetation types. A seven year simulation period was selected running from 2000 to 2006, with modeling conducted for eight months of the year using hourly time steps. The results showed that the performance of a green roof in runoff reduction depends on location, varying from 17% to 50% for low water use plants. The best performance in storm water reduction was predicted to occur in Regina and Calgary, while the poorest performance was predicted for Halifax and Vancouver. However, the average annual water retention (mm) was the highest in Toronto and London and the lowest in Vancouver, with Calgary, Regina and Halifax showing intermediate performance. Sensitivity analyses were performed for substrate depth, porosity, and wilting point to determine the importance of each for green roof performance for the different cities. The results revealed that the vegetation type had a greater impact on the water retention performance of green roofs than increases in substrate storage capacity associated with different substrate depth, porosity and wilting point over the range assumed in this study.

AB Headwater streams with a forested riparian zone and canopy cover have regulated stream temperatures and stream ecosystem metabolism because of shading. Agricultural practices have dramatically altered riparian corridors with the removal of mature vegetation, which consequently alters natural stream processes. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of shading on stream temperature and ecosystem metabolism in an agriculturally influenced, low order stream. We examined three stream reaches; two in a recently restored stream (Lost Creek) and one in a nearby-unimpacted reference stream (Little Plover River). The two reaches in Lost Creek included a 100-m artificially-shaded stream reach and a control reach immediately upstream of the shaded reach. The Little Plover River included one reference reach with a fully forested canopy. Both streams are located in agricultural watersheds and based on phosphorus levels would be classified as meso-eutrophic. Each stream reach was assessed during stable flow conditions once each month between June and October of 2016. Rates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem production (NEP) were determined using the open system, two-station diel dissolved oxygen change method, and reaeration (k) was calculated using the nighttime regression method. Based on stream discharge data, we corrected metabolism values for groundwater when inputs exceeded 7% (Hall and Tank 2005). We also measured water temperature, PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), periphytic chlorophyll a content, and organic matter content at each site as potential controlling variables. Surprisingly, no significant differences were observed in daily maximum water temperatures among the three sites; however, GPP levels were significantly lower (ANOVA F-2,(14) = 45.45; p < 0.001) in the artificially shaded reach and the reference site compared to the control indicating that shading reduced GPP. ER was not significantly different among the reaches and remained relatively low, which resulted in the control reach having a highly positive and significantly higher NEP (ANOVA F-2,(14) = 17.656 p < 0.001) compared to the shaded and reference reaches. Redundancy analysis revealed that GPP and NEP were strongly correlated with PAR. Our findings suggest that shading can improve dissolved oxygen dynamics in an agriculturally-influenced stream by lowering GPP.

AB This work provides a comprehensive review on the specific transport characteristics and the associated transport models of sediments, chemicals, and colloids in vegetative filter strips (VFSs). The main goal of the review is to improve current understanding of the main processes, mechanisms, and models of VFSs as the best management practice to mitigate the non-point source pollution. The overall removal efficiency of a VFS varies among different contaminants. For sediments, particle size and distribution are the critical factors that influence their fate and transport in VFSs. For adsorptive chemicals such as pesticides and phosphorus (P), one critical factor for their fate and transport in a VFS is the distribution coefficient between soluble and particle phases. For nonreactive chemicals such as nitrogen (N), soluble phase plays an important role in controlling their fate and transport in a VFS, while bio-chemical reaction may also be important. For colloids, particle and flow characteristics are the main factors affecting their transport and removal in a VFS. Previous studies have built transport models based on the specific characteristic of contaminants. Some of the models are empirical with regression equations based on experimental data. There are also some mechanistic VFS models that are process-based and rely on contaminant transport mechanisms. When coupled with the hydrology models, these models can be used to simulate the fate and transport of various contaminants in VFSs.

AB Phytoremediation is becoming recognised as a promising environmental approach to decontaminate land. However, establishing large-scale plantations for phytoremediation purposes can bear prohibitive costs. In order to deliver large-scale phytoremediation projects, easily implemented plant establishment solutions need to be available to practitioners. Here, we present a novel planting technology based on willow microcuttings for the rapid establishment of phytoremediation plantations. An experiment was performed testing the effect of microcutting planting density and diversity on various growth parameters including aboveground biomass yields. After two growing seasons, aboveground dry biomass reached an equivalent of 23.1 t/ha. Willow microcutting planting density and diversity did not significantly affect biomass yields, although other growth parameters (survival, stand density and mean stem height) differed across treatments. Our results suggest that this willow microcutting planting technology is viable at large-scale, robust across willow species and represents a lower cost alternative to more traditional planting technologies.

AB Ecological regions are areas of similar nature in terms of environmental features. Examination of the correspondence between organismal assemblage structure and function at different levels of spatial scale is crucial regarding pond conservation, especially in unexplored areas as continental austral Patagonia, where the extensive sheep breeding has been the historical land use. We assessed relationships between invertebrate assemblages and environmental characteristics at local (hydrogeomorphology and genesis) and landscape scale (phytogeographical and biozones) on 20 isolated wetland ponds (Southern Patagonia, Argentina). Additionally, we recognized best environmental predictors of invertebrate community attributes using generalized linear models (GLM). Most ponds displayed low anthropogenic stress since most of them were far from urban and rural settlements. Even though a few sites showed strong oxygen depletion (n = 3), most were well oxygenated ( > 85%, > 11 mg/l). Also, ponds had low ammonia and soluble reactive phosphorus contents ( > 60%, 25 mu g/l). A total of 80 invertebrate taxa were found, with Insecta and Oligochaeta displaying the highest richness. Cyanallagma interruptum (Anisoptera), Parapsectrocladius sp. and Parachironomus sp. (Chironomidae) were the most abundant taxa. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) showed that local environmental factors greatly explained the abundance patterns of invertebrates. In addition, variance partitioning analyses displayed that taxa responded more strongly to pond genesis (7% of variation) than to the other levels of spatial scale analyzed. Structural and functional attributes of communities (metrics) also showed that genesis (local scale) resulted a reliable predictor. Thus, the community composition changed according to fluvial, glacigenic, mass removal or anthropogenic origin of the ponds. Our results suggest that ponds across the austral continental Patagonia area appeared as crucial reservoirs of invertebrate biodiversity sustaining several endemic taxa. However, the expansion of new agricultural and land use practices in surrounding areas could impact negatively on pond integrity. Conservation programs should include major constrains at both, local and landscape scale, in which part of the physical complexity is driving by pond origin.

AB Using earthen liners at the base of an integrated constructed wetland (ICW) maintains a hydraulic continuum between the ICW and the underlying groundwater body. This may enable migration of reactive carbon (dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC, DIC)) and reactive nitrogen (N-r) across this liner to groundwater along this continuum to groundwater. Therefore, in terms of a holistic assessment of ICWs, quantification of these losses is important and indeed from an environmental perspective comparing such losses to other ICW dis-connected areas within the same groundwater body is critical. The main objective of the present study on an ICW site in SE Ireland was to compare reactive forms of C and N in groundwater (three piezometer nests) representing the continuum end point of ICW Cell 2 and 3 with that of groundwater dis-connected to the ICW system. For this purpose two control planes consisting of shallow and deep groundwater piezometer nests were installed and monitored at 1 and 4 m depths, respectively underneath the earthen liners at 0.2 m adjacent to the ICW cells. Fieldwork was conducted between Nov 2013 and Nov 2014 and results showed that groundwater beneath the ICW liner had a highly reduced signal with C and N concentrations being significantly higher to those of the disconnected up-gradient groundwater. The DOC, DIC and dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations in groundwater beneath the ICW cells were significantly higher than the up-gradient groundwater. All the reactive forms of C were higher in Cell 2 than in Cell 3. With respect to depth, all forms of reactive C were higher in deeper groundwater than the shallow equivalents except for DOC. Equally, N-r concentrations (NH4+, DON, NO3--N and N2O) were higher in groundwater beneath the ICW cells than the up-gradient groundwater. They were higher in Cell 2 than in Cell 3 and higher in shallow rather than deep groundwater. The fate of the reactive C and N is unknown. Typically DOC delivery from groundwater to surface water drives many biogeochemical processes as an electron donor to microbes or can be converted to CO2 and CH4 emissions and the dissolved CO2 and CH4 can be indirectly exchanged to the atmosphere. The results suggest that nutrient delivery from the ICW cells to the underlying groundwater needs to be evaluated and the design of earthen-lined ICWs should consider this nutrient loss continuum across the liner.

AB China began implementing the world's most ambitious afforestation and forest conservation projects in 2000s. However, whether the forest restoration efforts facilitate forest recovery, and whether the changes in land-use/ land-cover (LULC) driven by afforestation projects affect ecosystem services remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the changes in LULC and water-related ecosystem services (i.e., water yield, water purification, and soil conservation) using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Service and Tradeoffs) model in China's Han River basin, the water source region of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (Middle Route). Our study indicated that forest restoration projects greatly facilitated conversion of shrublands and croplands into forests, which dominated the LULC change (LULCC) and subsequently improved the water purification and soil conservation services but slightly decreased water yield services during 2000-2010. By excluding the influence of climatic factors, we found that 4.79 x 10(8) m(3) of water yield were reduced by LULCC, which equals to 0.69% of water yield in 2000. In contrast, the LULCC improved soil conservation services markedly and reduced 1.72 x 10(7) t sediment, i.e., 12.8% of sediment export in 2000. Meanwhile, 761.7 t nitrogen loading was cut down by the LULCC. The Danjiangkou Reservoir subwatershed, the water supply site for the water transfer project, showed a net decrease of 302 t nitrogen loading from 2000 to 2010. Although the nitrogen loading showed a decreasing trend in 40 out of 50 subwatersheds during 2000-2010, ten subwatersheds showed increasing trends, including the Ren River, Laoguan River, Bai River, Diao River, Youshui River, Tang River, Han River, Xushui River, Sanjia River, and Dan River. These regions should be taken as the priorities for ecosystem restoration and environmental management in the future.

AB Downstream migrating anguillid eels face many barriers including turbines and pumps at impoundments for water abstraction, power generation and water level control, when attempting to exit the freshwater catchment to reach spawning grounds. Multiple eel species worldwide are facing different levels of endangerment and alleviating the impacts of barriers to migration is essential to allow completion of the life cycle. Deep bypass systems with entrances located near the riverbed hold some promise for increased effectiveness compared to traditional downstream guidance and bypass facilities with entrances near the surface, as eels typically occupy the bottom of the water column. Here we evaluate two deep entrance bypass designs; an airlift (the Conte Airlift) and a conventional gravity siphon of the same entrance dimensions. Tests were performed using migratory silver-phase American eels (Anguilla rostrata), at night, in a simulated forebay environment. Passage performance was monitored over a 3 h test period using both PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag and video recording equipment. Entrance velocity was fixed at 1.2 m s(-1) in each of 8 test runs with cohort size fixed in six runs at 14 and in two runs at 42. Test eels readily located, entered and passed both bypass designs. Differences in performance metrics between the airlift and siphon were not statistically significant (P > 0.05) with linked mean values of 74.5%, 90.5% and 100%, respectively. Eel length did not affect passage speed (P > 0.05) or slip ratio, i.e., the measured eel velocity relative to fluid velocity. The slip ratio was, however, greater in the siphon than in the airlift (P < 0.01) within identical vertical upflow sections of the test equipment. Siphon slip ratios in the upflow vertical section were comparable to those established for the horizontal and downflow sections. Fish density did not affect attraction and passage through the airlift or siphon. No mortality or signs of injury were observed on any of the test eels through a 48 h post-test observation period. Both airlift and siphon downstream bypass systems show promise as effective technologies for protection of downstream migrating eels at a variety of water diversion or hydroelectric sites that pose threats of impingement, entrainment, and turbine mortality.

AB Aquaponics is the integration of recirculating aquaculture and hydroponic systems which is considered to be an innovative, eco-friendly and sustainable food production technology. In this study, a special design of hydroponic biofilter that integrated constructed wetlands and floating-raft rice hydroponics was constructed to treat the nutrient rich effluents from the intensive fishpond and to establish an aquaponic system on pond scale. The treatment efficiencies and food production potential of the new rice hydroponic biofilter was evaluated after determining the key operating parameters. As the results, overall nutrient removal efficiency was optimized at hydraulic load rate (HLR) of 0.58 m.d(-1) and air-to-water ratio of 2:1. The average removal efficiencies of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) from fishpond wastewater were in the range of 33.75-34.31%, 59.21-64.53%, 68.43-73.75% and 71.66-74.37%, respectively. Meanwhile, hydroponic rice grew well in the biofilter and gained a yield of 7 127 kg.ha(-1). These results probably implied that the novel rice hydroponic biofilter exhibited efficient effluent treatment and presented as a viable alternative for the food production in a pond-scale aquaponics recirculating system.

AB A better understanding of the hydrologic impacts of high-intensity urbanization is necessary for urban planning aimed at mitigating the impact of land development on floods. This study investigated the effects of percent pervious cover (PPC) and associated spatial pattern on surface runoff in a high-density urban area surrounding the North Moat in Beijing, China. We selected 21 rainfall events that occurred in 2011 and 2012. Surface runoff during each rainfall event in the 76 subcatchments with different degrees and patterns of urbanization was simulated with a calibrated Storm Water Management Model. There was high estimation accuracy in both total runoff volumes and variations in runoff volumes per minute for single-event simulations. The modelled results showed that increases in pervious cover were significantly related to reduced runoff regardless of spatial patterns and rainfall levels, but pervious cover was more effective in controlling low amounts of runoff when PPC increased from a low value to 30-40%. Increases in PPC to 30-40% were associated with critical transitions in the spatial configuration of pervious patches, from strong fragmentation to strong connectivity, which greatly reduced runoff. The overland flow routing from impervious area over pervious area to outlet (IMPERV-PERV pattern) could significantly reduce most of the runoff when PPC was below 30%; but only significantly reduced light rain and moderate rain runoff when PPC was 30-60%, especially, the role of flow routing in controlling extreme rainstorm floods was usually not significant. The results demonstrated that the extents and spatial patterns of urban pervious and impervious surfaces have strong influences on runoff.

AB Fish are thought to exploit low velocity recirculation zones in the wakes of baffles to take refuge from challenging hydraulic conditions in baffled culverts. Here, we investigate how sediment deposition in the wakes of baffles affects passage and behaviors of juvenile rainbow trout in a baffled experimental flume. High temporal resolution 3D fish tracking provided detailed kinematics of adopted trajectories. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry permitted a finely resolved description of the flow over a clear baffle configuration and the same configuration with sediment wedges placed in their wakes. Controlled station-holding, suggestive of flow-refuging, only occurred when sediment wedges were blocking the baffles' recirculation region. Also, maximum distances of ascent were higher, and slower ground-speeds were employed in the sediment condition. The results of this study suggest the turbulent recirculatory wakes of the clear bed condition caused postural instabilities and were in many ways detrimental to passage performance. Additional research is required to understand the relationships existing between baffle height, hydrodynamic recirculatory wake metrics, sediment deposition and the behavioral responses of fish interacting with weir baffle wakes.

AB Accurate analysis of water flow (streamflow and baseflow) is important for accurate water resources management. For accurate water resources management, modeled surface and groundwater hydrology should be calibrated simultaneously. The objectives of this study are: 1) to develop and provide an efficient flow calibration method (EFCM) for accurate baseflow estimation by combining the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting algorithm version 2 (SUFI-2) and modified SWAT 2012 code and 2) to evaluate the performance of the EFCM for streamflow and baseflow estimation. Both streamflow and baseflow estimated using the EFCM performed well based on three model evaluation methods (i.e., NSE, R-2, and PBIAS). Thus, the EFCM would be a practical method for accurate water resources management by calibrating baseflow accurately as well as streamflow at a watershed scale. This study can be used as a data-driven model groundwater modeling because the baseflow-related parameters (i.e., groundwater recharge and hydraulic conductivity) calibrated in this study can be used as a set of input data (initial parameter values) in computer-based numerical groundwater models.

AB Green infrastructure (GI) refers to environmental design features or engineered systems in an interconnected natural and urban space that provide multifunctional ecosystem services. However, there is great uncertainty and variation in the function of different GI features related to carbon and nitrogen cycling processes that are essential for sustained plant growth and water quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of GI designs (enhanced tree pits (ETP), street-side infiltration swales (SSIS), and vegetation swales (VS)), including surface area, and watershed area ratio (WAR), on the biogeochemical processes and properties (organic carbon (C-org), total nitrogen (N-total), pH, salts, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), Pb, Zn, moisture content (MC), texture, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, potential net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification, microbial respiration, and denitrification potential) of GI engineered soils. Results showed that GI sites did not have significant levels of contamination with metals or TPH and that GI with larger surface area had significantly lower TPH, Pb, and Zn. Microbial biomass and activity were positively correlated with Corg, Ntotal, pH, MC, TPH, and WAR. Denitrification potential was higher in the ETP and SSIS (3 mg N kg(-1) h(-1)) compared to the VS (0.5 mg N kg(-1) h(-1)). Microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen contents were significantly higher in ETP followed by SSIS then VS. These results suggest that relatively young (< 10 years) GI sites provide significant levels of microbial biomass and activity that are important for carbon and nitrogen cycling.

AB Agricultural development is critical for economic growth and food security. However, sediment and nutrient runoff generated by farming may cause pollution and water quality deterioration. This study assessed the water quality effects of conversion of valley bottom wetlands to agriculture in southern Rwanda. Three land use/cover (LULC) types (fishponds, rice, wetland plots) were studied in a replicated mesocosm setup. LULC characteristics (hydrology, biomass growth) and practices (land preparation, feed/fertilizer application) and associated changes in total nitrogen and phosphorus (TN, TP), suspended solids (TSS), and other water quality characteristics were measured from 2011 to 2013. Fish farming used about half the amount of water compared to rice farming (101 mm m(-2) d(-1) compared with 191 mm m(-2) d(-1)). Higher TSS, TP and TN in inflows and outflows were associated mainly with human activities (cleaning of canals, ploughing, weeding, fertilizer application, fishpond drainage and dredging). As a result, fishponds and rice plots had consistently higher TSS concentrations in outflows (5-9506 and 7-2088 mg/L, respectively) than in inflows (7-120 and 9-483 mg/L, respectively). Peaks in TN and TP were associated with periods of farming activity. In wetland plots, TSS and TN significantly decreased from inlet to outlet, owing to the absence of disturbances and higher settling/adsorption, nutrient uptake and denitrification. Environmental restoration and sustainable agricultural production would be promoted by conservation farming and efficient water and fertilizer use. It is worth exploring the integration of fishponds for temporary storage of water, sediments and nutrients, and of natural wetlands as buffer zones for sediments and nutrients from farming during the critical periods of agricultural activity.

AB Passage performance of upstream-migrating lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) was compared between sections of a Crump flow-gauging weir with and without studded tiles, and at a bottom-baffle fishway, on the River Derwent, England. The effects of microhydropower operation on attraction to multiple routes were also studied. Studded tiles were fixed horizontally on the weir face near the right bank, forming a 1 m wide treatment route, neighboured by a tileless control route. A bottom-baffle fishway was present at the right bank, alongside the hydropower tailrace. Two further weir-face control routes at the left bank, in combination with those on the right side, enabled comparison of lamprey attraction relative to the weir flow. Downstream and upstream ends of the right-hand weir-face routes, and of the fishway, downstream ends of the left-hand weir face routes, and the entrance of the hydropower tailrace area were instrumented with PIT antennas (n = 9 total). Of 395 PIT-tagged lamprey, released 0.52 rkm downstream of the weir on 10 separate dates in early winter 2017 (turbine on for 21/43 days of study period), 363 (91.9%) were detected by at least one of the antennas (median [IQR] minimum delay at weir: 15.0 [7.4-21.4] days). All lamprey detected at the left-bank antennas (attraction efficiency AE: 255/395 [64.6%]) were also detected elsewhere. The fishway was ineffective (AE: 343/395 [86.8%]; passage efficiency PE: 5/343 [1.5%]). While lamprey were more attracted towards the control relative to the adjacent tiled route, a higher number of fish traversed the weir using the latter (AE tiled route: 172/395 [43.5%]; PE tiled route: 44/172 [25.6%]; AE control route: 257/395 [65.1%]; PE control route: 22/257 [8.6%]). Lamprey were attracted towards the right half of the channel when the turbine was running, as only n = 88/4190 (2.1% of total attempts) detections were made at the two left-bank control antennas in the turbine-on condition, compared to 2775/13,029 (21.3%) at the same two antennas when the turbine was off. While improved passage efficiency was achieved using surface-mounted studded tiles, further in situ evaluations are needed to optimize their performance.

AB The reforestation of the Amazon forest after mining requires the introduction of native species, such as the Brazil nut tree. However, there are incipient studies with the Brazil nut tree under these conditions. The aim of this study was to diagnose soil properties that determine the adequate growth of Brazil nut trees in bauxite mining restoration areas in the Amazon forest. Three Brazil nut tree sites in bauxite mining reforestation areas in Porto Trombetas-Oriximina (Para, Brazilian Amazon) were selected, two with high plant mortality and one with low plant mortality. During the mining process, the Fe-laterites layer that naturally occurs at approximately 4 m depth is broken, and the fragments are mixed into the overlying horizons of the original soil. This sterile material was scattered to reconstruct the soil profile after bauxite mining. Soil sampling was carried out for chemical (up to 50 cm depth) and physical analysis (up to 100 cm depth). The height and diameter of the trees, Fe-laterite mass on the soil surface, Fe-laterite occurrence along the soil profile and soil density were determined. The soil fertility was not the cause for the differences in tree growth among the sites. The primary cause of low Brazil nut tree growth was the physical degradation of soil. The Fe-laterites increase soil density and impairs root growth, favoring low growth and high mortality of plants. In the better-quality site, the Fe-laterite fragments were placed farther from the soil surface (similar to 27 cm). The negative effect of Fe-laterites in reforested areas after bauxite mining is not only a problem in Brazil, since approximately 88% of the world's bauxite reserves are the laterite-type (Meyer, 2004).

AB A novel integrated system consisted of microbial fuel cell, aerobic bioreactor, and anoxic bioreactor (MFC-AB-ANB) was designed and constructed to investigate its potential for the treatment of slaughterhouses wastewater associated with power generation and nitrogen recovery. A biocathodic tubular type MFC was used in this study and was inoculated with freshly collected activated sludge. The MFC-AB-ANB system was continuously operated for 163 days. The results revealed that maximum efficiencies of COD removal, ammonium oxidation, nitrate reduction, nitrogen recovery, Columbic efficiency, and power generation were 99%, 99.3%, 100%, 100%, 13.37% and 162.55 mW/m(2), respectively. A mathematical model was developed based on Nernst-Monod model coupled with nitrification-denitrification model to predicate and describe the removal of COD, ammonium, and nitrate during continuous operation of the system. Significant agreement between the predicted and experimental results was observed for the removal of COD, ammonium, nitrate, and power generation with determination coefficients of 0.9750, 0.95675, 0.95499, and 0.89897, respectively.

AB Environmental protection can maintain ecosystem health, improve the provision of ecosystem services, and increase human welfare. However, traditional calculations of the value of ecosystem services (VES) exclude their cost, thereby undermining plans to achieve a combination of environmental protection with sustainable socioeconomic development. To understand the difference between VES and the net value after accounting for costs (NES), we evaluated the evolution of the main ecosystem services in China. When costs are accounted for (i. e., when they are subtracted from VES), NES averaged 10.0 x 10(3) RMB.ha(-1).yr(-1) for China as a whole (35.1% of VES), with values of 39.0 x 10(3), -0.7 x 10(3), 27.7 x 10(3), and 13.0 x 10(3) RMB.ha(-1).yr(-1) for wetland, grassland, farmland, and forest ecosystems, respectively. These values represent decreases of 36.4, 114.9, 52.7, and 70.6% from the corresponding VES values. To achieve sustainable development and ecological restoration, China's government must base decisions on NES, not VES, to ensure that they account for the associated costs. Applying the present results in China and elsewhere in the world should increase the net benefits of ecological restoration while still permitting socioeconomic development.

AB Northern peatlands store approximately one third of the global soil carbon (C) stocks. Peat extraction for horticulture changes C fluxes turning these soils from sinks into large sources of C emitted to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. Restoring hydrological conditions may not be enough for returning the C sink function of these ecosystems and a recovery of the original Sphagnum-dominated vegetation cover could be necessary. Here we tested the effects of the moss layer-transfer technique (MLTT) on the CO2 and CH4 fluxes three years after restoration of a minerotrophic cutover peatland in Quebec, Canada. Gas emissions were compared to nearby undisturbed plots, and plots with restored hydrology but without vegetation transfer. The main drivers for the observed emissions were inferred from the relationships with relevant environmental variables (vegetation cover, water table depth and temperature). Restoration of the extracted minerotrophic fen through the MLTT produced significant changes in the exchange of CO2, bringing these fluxes closer to undisturbed plots than plots with restored hydrology only, which remained C sources throughout the study. Methane emissions were generally low across all the restored plots and far from natural levels, with only a slight increase at the MLTT restored plots observed during the third year. Even though the MLTT failed to recover the original bryophyte-dominated vegetation, the observed changes in the emissions of CO2 and CH4 at the restored plots were strongly associated with changes in vegetation cover (i.e. increase in vascular plants), supporting the use of this restoration technique to recover the C sink function of harvested minerotrophic peatlands.

AB Dredging of potentially contaminated sediments from ports and waterways is an inevitable operation in order to maintain adequate depths for ship navigation. The fate of these sediments is an issue discussed worldwide due to their impact on human and environmental health.
   In this scenario, the aim of the present study is to provide an innovative eco-friendly and adaptable solution for dredged sediment decontamination and rehabilitation based on sediment washing followed by a biological treatment.
   The sediment washing, conducted at pilot scale, split the raw dredged sediment into two fractions of homogeneous particle size (silt-clay fraction and sand fraction). Sand fraction was characterized by a significant lower values of heavy metals and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) with respect to the silt-clay and raw sediment samples.
   The biological treatment, carried out at mesoscale level, consisted in the addiction of a mixture of microorganisms (with hydrocarbon degrading ability), enzymes, and nutrients (bioactivator product) to the three matrices (raw sediment, silt-clay and sand). After three months, in raw sediment and sand fraction, the bioactivator product allowed a 46% and 55% removal of TPH, respectively; instead, in silt-clay fraction this treatment was not able to degrade significant amount of organic pollutants (reduction percentage of TPH lower than 5%). Culture-dependent analysis showed higher concentration of microbial cells immediately after addition of the bioactivator product and a general increasing of microbial biomass in both treated and untreated samples at the end of the experimentation. Moreover, PCR-DGGE analysis evidenced that the composition of microbial population varied in relation to the different granulometric characteristics of the sediment and to the application of the bioactivator product. Thus, the results here reported showed that bacterial and fungal communities responded differently to the bioremediation treatment.
   These results seem very promising considering the complexity of the material to be decontaminated and the apparent difficulty of creating acceptable habitat for the operation of a biological active system.

AB Large-scale forest degradation has led to a drastic alteration of forest landscapes worldwide with severe consequences for human well-being and ecosystem services. The extent and spatial composition of forests within a landscape mosaic play a crucial role in processes and functions ranging from stand to landscape scales. A fundamental task for forest landscape restoration is the identification of potential forest types and species for restoration. In this study, we demonstrated how to restore and manage a degraded secondary forest accounting stand condition while simultaneously targeting optimal landscape structure and function. First, we identified 14 native primary forest types that correspond to different topographies in the study area with data from previous studies. Then, we extracted topography data from a digital elevation model and forest inventory. Combining the topography data with the native primary forest types, we identified the forest types for restoration in each forest sub-compartment. However, some sub-compartments had multiple alternative. Based on the landscape structure analyses, the optimal arrangement of forest types for restoration in the landscape was determined. Combined landscape restoration target and potential forest types for restoration of each sub-compartment, the locations and the species for restoration were determined. This study provides a significant baseline for forest restoration and increase restoration effects.

AB Increased predation risk or avoidance of wildlife underpasses by small mammals have been highlighted. To overcome this problem and to provide these species with an opportunity to safely cross road-crossing structures, we previously designed an Anti-Predation Tube (APT). The features (shape and size) of this device have been tested under laboratory conditions and its use by captive European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) has been validated. In this study, we investigate both the enrichment and anti-predation functions of the APT for hamsters in an actual underpass. To do so, we built two small enclosures of 6 m(2) at both extremities of an underpass and cross-manipulated the presence of the APT and a predator of hamsters, the European ferret. Our results show that the APT does not act as an enrichment, as it did not increase the crossing frequency of hamsters in the absence of the predator. However, it acts as an anti-predation device, since, in the presence of the ferret, male hamsters crossed more than 10 times as much when the APT was present inside the underpass than when it was not. We therefore recommend implementing the APT as a conservation measure to upgrade wildlife underpasses while conducting surveys to investigate how the presence of the APT influences the crossing of other small mammals and wildlife.

AB Fish require access to multiple habitats to persist. Therefore, obstacles blocking a fish's volitional ability to move between habitats can lead to its decline. A common way of addressing this problem is the construction of fishways. The design criteria of fishways are based on steady, uniform flows with the assumption that the water levels remain the same across the fishway. However once constructed, fishways are fundamentally dynamic systems exhibiting different hydrodynamic scenarios. These scenarios are classified as uniform and non-uniform water level profiles and are driven by changes in the up- and downstream water levels caused by operational and hydrological variability.
   In this paper, we demonstrate the need to consider a wider range of fishway hydrodynamic scenarios for an integral assessment of fishways. To do this, the spatial distribution of Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) in a full-scale model of a vertical slot fishway under three different hydrodynamic scenarios is investigated. Video tracking was used to analyze the fish's spatial distribution, and an acoustic Doppler velocimeter and lateral line probe were applied to characterize the local hydrodynamic conditions of each scenario. Spatial differences were tested using Syrjala's test and the relation with hydrodynamic variables analyzed by means of zero-inflated Poisson models. This study revealed three significant findings: 1) Fish made broader use of the fishway pool in scenarios with lower water drops, which are highly correlated with regions of overall lower turbulence and velocity magnitude. 2) The relative importance of physical variables varied between scenarios. Specifically, the protection offered by walls was found to be a determining factor in the spatial usage. 3) It is shown that a vertical slot fishway designed with the standard dimensions for fish passage under the assumption of uniform flow conditions may result in an adverse hydrodynamic environment for fish swimming under non-uniform conditions.

AB Immunometabolic framework provides a way to understand the immune regulation via cell intrinsic metabolic fluxes and metabolites during infections, tumors, and inflammatory disorders. During these diseases, the immune cells are activated requiring more energy and moderating their metabolic functions. The two categories of metabolic alterations are therefore causally associated with energy derivation and cellular functions. Pathogens, tumors and inflammation target energy metabolism, primarily glucose uptake, glucose catabolism, gluconeogenesis for continuing lipid metabolism through mainstream pathways such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial respiration and pentose phosphate pathway. Many biosynthetic pathways such as those of cholesterol, ceramide, sphingolipids, and fatty acids are altered explaining the metabolic interface in molecular pathogenesis in various infectious and non-infectious inflammatory diseases. The emerging immune-metabolic framework also identifies the key regulatory elements such as metabolites, signalling intermediates and transcription factors. These regulatory elements play key roles in deciding the fate of an infection, tumor or auto immune diseases. The original research articles and the review articles in this Special issue of Cytokine on "Infection, Inflammation and Immunometabolomes" highlight these aspects of metabolic reprogramming and the role of some `metabolomic regulators' in controlling the outcome of infectious and non-infectious diseases. In this Editorial, we introduce the readers to these articles discussing the elements in immune-metabolic framework.

ID EXPERIMENTAL VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS
AB Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that infects mammalian macrophages, wherein the parasite resides and replicates as amastigotes, inflicting the potentially fatal disease visceral leishmaniasis. The disease is characterized by severe immunosuppression and hypocholesterolemia implying metabolic changes in L. donovani infection; whether such metabolic changes are also linked to susceptibility to the infection is not known. Herein, four inbred mouse strains were first characterized for their resistance or susceptibility profile to L. donovani infection. It was observed that these four mouse strains were differentially susceptible to L. donovani infection. Splenic expression of four key cytokines IL-10, IL-12, IFN-gamma and IL-4- revealed that the differential susceptibility of these four mouse strains to L. donovani was partially associated with these cytokines. The association was further correlated with the expression of different enzymes of the glycolytic pathway in the spleen of these L. donovani-infected mice. Thus, the observations reported here suggest an association between host metabolism, cytokine secretion profile and L. donovani susceptibility. As the chemotherapeutic choices are extremely limited and a vaccine for human use is yet to be discovered for the neglected tropical disease that is prevalent in 88 countries affecting 320 million people, this metabolic study is a significant research area that has potentials to develop a new target for anti-leishmanial chemotherapy.

AB Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites from the genus Leishmania. The most severe form of disease is visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is fatal if left untreated. It has been demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-10, is associated with disease progression and susceptibility. In this work, we took advantage of a transgenic mouse model that expresses high levels of IL-10 upon zinc sulfate administration (pMT-10). We addressed the role of IL-10 during the initial stages of L. donovani infection by analyzing the parasite burden in the spleen and liver of the infected pMT-10 and WT mice as well as the histopathological alterations upon IL-10 induction. Furthermore, the profile of cytokines expressed by T cells was assessed. Our results demonstrate that an increase in IL-10 production has an impact early but not later after infection. This specific temporal role for IL-10-mediated susceptibility to VL is of interest.

DE Spontaneous Apoptosis; Type 1 IFN; Neutrophils apoptosis inhibition
ID IFN-ALPHA/BETA; INHIBITION; INFECTION
AB Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils (PMNs) are metabolically highly active phagocytes, present in abundant numbers in the circulation. These active cells take the onus of clearing invading pathogens by crowding at inflammatory sites in huge numbers. Though PMNs are extremely short living and die upon spontaneous apoptosis, extended lifespan has been observed among those cells arrive at the inflammation sites or tackle intracellular infections or face any microbial challenges. The delay/inhibition of spontaneous apoptosis of these short-living cells at the inflammatory core rather helps in combating pathogens. Like many candidates, type-1 interferons (type-1 IFNs) is a group of cytokines predominant at the inflammation site. Although there are some isolated reports, a systematic study is still lacking which addresses the impact of the predominant type of interferon on the spontaneous apoptosis of neutrophils. Here in, we have observed that exposure of these IFNs (IFN-beta, IFN-alpha & IFN-omega etc) on human neutrophils prevents the degradation of the BM, an important antiapoptotic partner in the apoptotic cascade. Treatment showed a significant reduction in the release of cytochrome-C in the cytosol, a critical regulator in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. We also noticed a reduction in the conversion of procaspase-3 to active caspase-3, a crucial executioner caspase towards initiation of apoptosis. Taken together our results show that exposure to interferon interferes with apoptotic pathways of neutrophils and thereby delay its spontaneous apoptosis. These findings would help us further deciphering specific roles if these inflammatory agents are causing any immune-metabolomic changes on PMNs at the inflammatory and infection core.

AB Leishmania is an obligate intracellular parasite uses low pH phagolysosomal compartments of host macrophages as their final abode. IL-1 beta is a pro inflammatory cytokine, which is secreted by immune cells to trigger inflammation and this has been found profoundly in the lesions caused by Leishmania pathogens. But the specific role of this cytokine on host cell macrophages during infection has not been fully explored. Here in, we have showed that prolonged exposure of IL-1 beta on macrophages increases the parasite burden. Pre-treatment of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) with IL-1 beta also generates significantly higher amount of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. As IL-10 plays crucial role in the establishment of infection, enhanced production of IL-10 observed upon IL-1 beta treatment could contribute to the progression of the disease. By quantifying the production of Nitric oxide (NO), we further report that the pretreatment of IL-1 beta fails to produce the nitric oxide. By measuring the footpad thickness in two different mice strains of differential susceptibility we showed IL-1 beta treatment increases parasitic burden. As our results shows that the exposure of IL-1 beta helps in disease progression, IL-1 beta signalling may be an attractive target for future therapeutic intervention.

AB Metabolomics refers to top-down systems biological analysis of metabolites in biological specimens. Phenotypic proximity of metabolites makes them interesting candidates for studying biomarkers of environmental stressors such as parasitic infections. Moreover, the host parasite interaction directly impinges upon metabolic pathways since the parasite uses the host metabolite pool as a biosynthetic resource. Malarial infection, although not recognized as a classic metabolic disorder, often leads to severe metabolic changes such as hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Thus, metabolomic analysis of the infection has become an invaluable tool for promoting a better understanding of the host parasite interaction and for the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge obtained from metabolomic studies of malarial infection in rodent models and human patients. Metabolomic analysis of experimental rodent malaria has provided significant insights into the mechanisms of disease progression including utilization of host resources by the parasite, sexual dimorphism in metabolic phenotypes, and cellular changes in host metabolism. Moreover, these studies also provide proof of concept for prediction of cerebral malaria. On the other hand, metabolite analysis of patient biofluids generates extensive data that could be of use in identifying biomarkers of infection severity and in monitoring disease progression. Through the use of metabolomic datasets one hopes to assess crucial infection-specific issues such as clinical severity, drug resistance, therapeutic targets, and biomarkers. Also discussed are nascent or newly emerging areas of metabolomics such as pre-erythrocytic stages of the infection and the host immune response. This review is organized in four broad sections methodologies for metabolomic analysis, rodent infection models, studies of human clinical specimens, and potential of immunometabolomics. Data summarized in this review should serve as a springboard for novel hypothesis testing and lead to a better understanding of malarial infection and parasite biology.

AB Neutrophils are short-living innate immune cells present in abundance in the circulation and they provide the first line of defense against infection. Microbicidal effector functions of the immune cells are tightly linked with their metabolic state. Overall knowledge of the association of neutrophil defense with cellular metabolism is still elusive. Recent studies have reported that neutrophil metabolism during granulopoiesis is impacted by the homeostatic process of autophagy. Autophagy is a complex process of which the subtype xenophagy, an antimicrobial autophagic process, clears invading pathogens. Neutrophils, being sentinels of innate immunity, encounter microbes and digest them. Studies on neutrophil antimicrobial autophagy process is still in its primeval state and has not been much explored as in other professional phagocytes. However, several obligate-intracellular pathogens are able to subvert the toxic antimicrobial machineries and utilize neutrophils as their final abodes or "Trojan Horses" for further propagation. In this review, we would provide an insight into the relationship between neutrophil microbicidal effector functions emphasizing on selective antimicrobial autophagy and metabolism, highlighting on some successful pathogens which have evolved ways to subvert or exploit this defense.

AB Recent evidences indicate that change in cellular metabolic pathways can alter immune response and function of the host; emphasizing the role of metabolome in health and diseases. Human Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV1) and type-2 (HSV-2) causes diseases from asymptomatic to highly prevalent oral and genital herpes, recurrent blisters or neurological complications. Immune responses against HSV are complex with delicate interplay between innate signaling pathways and adaptive immune responses. The innate response involves the induction of protective IFN-1; while Natural Killer (NK) cells and plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDC) confer in vivo adaptive anti-HSV response along with humoral and cellular components in controlling infection and latency. Metabolic changes lead to up-/down-regulation of several cytokines and chemokines like IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and MIP1 beta in HSV infection and recurrences. Recently, the viral protein ICP0 has been identified as an attenuator of TLR signaling, that inhibit innate responses to HSV. This review will summarize the role of metabolome in innate and adaptive effectors in infection, pathogenesis and immune control of HSV, highlighting the delicate interplay between the metabolic changes and immunity.

AB Rickettsioses are zoonotic infections caused by obligate intracellular bacteria of the genera Rickettsia that affect human health; sometimes humans being considered as accidental hosts. At a molecular level, the rickettsiae infection triggers molecular signaling leading to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines direct the immune response to the host cell damage and pathogen removal. In this review, we present metabolic aspects of the host cell in the presence of rickettsiae and how this presence triggers an inflammatory response to cope with the pathogen. We also reviewed the secretion of cytokines that modulates host cell response at immune and metabolic levels.

AB Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive bacterium, can cause a broad range of severe diseases including pneumonia, septicemia and meningitis. The pneumococcal pathophysiology is highly dependent on host nutrients such as purines, pyrimidines, amino acids and carbon sources. The study of S. pneumoniae metabolism is essential for understanding the adaption strategies that are required to deal with the host environment during infection and to identify possible new drug targets. By using a combination of high analytical techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), liquid chromatography (LC) and/or gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectroscopy (MS) the metabolism of S. pneumoniae can be precisely investigated. This review summarizes the metabolism and major virulence factors of S. pneumoniae within the context of infection. Furthermore, it addresses the antibiotic resistance and its influence on metabolism as well as new antimicrobial substances for the treatment of S. pneumoniae.

AB The disease leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The disease displays a spectrum of clinical manifestations relating to the stage of the infection and the pathogen-specific immune response. The most frequent M. leprae-specific hypersensitivity reactions are erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and type-1 (reversal) reaction (T1R). Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid-derived lipid mediators are involved in the regulation of these M. leprae-specific inflammatory and immune responses. Studies on lipid mediators showed their presence during different manifestations of leprosy-before and after multidrug therapy (MDT) and during T1R. This review aims to compare the lipid mediators at different stages of the disease. This review also presents new data on the significance of lipid mediators (cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene B-4, prostaglandin E-2 and D-2, lipoxin A(4) and resolvin D1) on ENL.

AB Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a central mediator of host immune responses including T-cell differentiation and activation of macrophages for the control of bacterial pathogens. Anti-bacterial mechanisms of IFN-gamma against the obligate intracellular bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis in epithelial cells have been intensively investigated in the past, focusing on cellular tryptophan depletion by an IFN-gamma induced expression of the indoleamine 2, 3-deoxygenase (IDO).
   In this study, we could show that IFN-gamma treatment caused a significant reduction of the host cell glycolysis that was accompanied by a reduction of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) expression. Furthermore, C. trachomatis induced enhancement of glycolytic and mitochondrial activation were significantly suppressed by IFN-gamma treatment. We could further show that glucose starvation, as observed under IFN-gamma treatment, was associated with an attenuated antimicrobial efficacy of doxycycline (DOX) against C. trachomatis.
   In conclusions, anti-chlamydial activity of IFN-gamma goes beyond tryptophan depletion including interference with cellular energy metabolism resulting reduced progeny, but also impaired antimicrobial susceptibility of C. trachomatis.

AB Osteoclasts are specialised cells that resorb bone and develop from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. While there is a wealth of information on the regulation of macrophage function through metabolic activity, the connection between osteoclast differentiation and metabolism is less well understood. Recent data show that mitochondria participate in switching macrophages from an inflammatory phenotype towards differentiation into osteoclasts. Additionally, it was found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) actively take place in osteoclast differentiation by acting as secondary signalling molecules. Bone resorption is an energy demanding process and differentiating osteoclasts triggers the biogenesis of mitochondria. In addition, the activity of specific OXPHOS components of macrophages and osteoclasts is differentially regulated.
   This review summarises our knowledge on macrophage-mediated inflammation, its impact on a cell's metabolic activity and its effect on osteoclast differentiation.

AB Adiponectin, the most prevalent adipo-cytokine in plasma plays critical metabolic and anti-inflammatory roles is fast emerging as an important molecular target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Adiponectin action is critical in multiple organs including cardio-vascular system, muscle, liver, adipose tissue, brain and bone. Adiponectin signaling in bone has been a topic of active investigation lately. Human association studies and multiple mice models of gene deletion/modification failed to define a clear cause and effect of adiponectin signaling in bone. The most plausible reason could be the multimeric forms of adiponectin that display differential binding to receptors (adipoR1 and adipoR2) with cell-specific receptor variants in bone. Discovery of small molecule agonist of adipoR1 suggested a salutary role of this receptor in bone metabolism. The downstream signaling of adipoR1 in osteoblasts involves stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased differentiation via the likely suppression of wnt inhibitor, sclerostin. On the other hand, the inflammation modulatory effect of adiponectin signaling suppresses the RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) - to - OPG (osteprotegerin) ratio in osteoblasts leading to the suppression of osteoclastogenic response. This review will discuss the adiponectin signaling and its role in skeletal homeostasis and critically assess whether adipoR1 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases.

AB Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that is involved in divers immune responses and implicated in a number of diseases. However, this cytokine has other non-immune functions. Within this review, we highlight selected effects on metabolic pathways, which are mediated, controlled or modified by the IL-6. Importantly, putting spotlight on such concepts could allow us to classify IL-6 among the metabolic hormones and further study it to both deepen our knowledge on disorders involving metabolic or energy imbalances such as obesity and develop novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, potential explanations related to IL-6 roles in both physiology and pathology as well as relevant implications and applications on both research and therapeutic fields are also pointed as consequences of the involvement of IL-6 in the energy and metabolic homeostasis via its "endocrine" roles.

AB Four isomeric chloro-substituted 2-methylbenzyl radicals were generated from the corona discharge of 3- and 4-chloro-o-xylenes seeded in a large amount of He carrier gas using a technique of corona excited supersonic expansion coupled with a pinhole-type glass nozzle. The observed visible vibronic emission spectra were analyzed to identify the radical species produced in the discharge, from which the production of the 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-chloro-2- methylbenzyl radicals was confirmed. In addition, we determined the D-1 -> D-0 electronic transition energies and vibrational mode frequencies in the D-0 state of the isomeric chloro-substituted 2-methylbenzyl radicals.

AB Raman spectra of aqueous uracil stacked dimer have been studied by employing density functional theory based molecular dynamics simulation together with the maximally localized Wannier functions. The unpolarized spectra are in a reasonable good agreement with the available experimental spectrum. The discrepancies are attributed to the used density functional approximation. Static quantum chemical calculations reveal that the coupling of the carbonyl stretching modes is significantly weaker than the one of the amide modes. The non-coincidence effect of the ring breathing mode is explained in terms of repulsive steric interactions.

AB The conformer-related reaction pathways in the cycloaddition of vinylaziridines with alkynes were calculated using DFT methods. The calculated results reveal that the ring-opening products of vinylaziridines possess two different conformers with the specific sites available for coordination of alkynes. The formed alkyne-coordinated complexes results in the different C-N bond addition intermediates. In the cycloaddition reaction catalyzed by [Rh(eta(6) -C10H8)(COD)]SbF6, the intermediate needs an isomerization to yield the final [5 + 2] cycloaddition product. In the reaction catalyzed by [Rh(NBD)(2)]BF4, such an isomerization is dispensable to yield the final [3 + 2] cycloaddition product.

The results show that the conductance of the single diketopyrrolopyrrole molecular device can be modulated by changing the electrode. Remarkable negative differential resistance behavior can be found in the single diketopyrrolopyrrole molecular device with zigzag graphene nanoribbon electrode. In addition, we find that the anchoring groups play an important role in the magnitude of the device's current.

AB First-principles calculations have been utilized to investigate the electronic and optical properties of GaTe monolayer. The GaTe single-layer reveals a proper bandgap and suitable optical properties that not observed in the other layered materials, including absorption coefficient larger than 10(4) cm(-1) at the visible light range. Combining the electronic and optical properties, GaTe monolayer has a great possibility to be used as ultraviolet detectors and photovoltaic absorbers. Accordingly, our results suggest significant guidelines for the design of optoelectronic devices that made of layered GaTe. The present work provides useful guidance for further expanding the practical application range of GaTe materials.

The mixed timer He - Ne - C6H6 is also detected. Four bands are analyzed for each complex, namely nu(12) itself (approximate to 3048 cm(-1)) and three linked combination bands (approximate to 3079, 3100, and 3102 cm(-1)). The results are consistent with previous ultraviolet and microwave results, with Ne-2 - C6H6 and He - Ne - C6H6 being analyzed spectro-scopically here for the first time.

AB The influence of hydrostatic pressure on structural, electronic and optical properties of short period (BeS)(1)/(BeSe)(1), (BeSe)(1)/(BeTe)(1) and (BeS)(1)/(BeTe)1 superlattices, has been investigated. The lattice parameters a and c for the tetragonal unit cell obtained by total energy calculations are in good agreement with the values calculated by macroscopic elasticity theory. The (BeS)(1)/(BeSe)(1) superlattice possesses an indirect band gap while (BeSe)(1)/(BeTe)(1) and (BeS)(1)/(BeTe)(1) superlattices possess a direct band gap. The pressure ranges from 0 to 47 GPa for (BeS)(1)/(BeSe)(1), 0 to 39 GPa for (BeSe)(1)/(BeTe)(1), and 0 to 45 GPa for (BeS)(1)/(BeTe)(1) , meanwhile the pressure dependence of the energy band gap along different symmetry directions obey the equation E-g(p)= E-g+ ap + bp(2). The pressure coefficient of the indirect band gap for (BeS)(1)/(BeSe)(1) is - 22.5675 x 10(-3) eV(GPa)(-1), while that of the direct band gap is estimated as - 25.8581 x 10(-3)eV(GPa)(-1) and - 24.4695 x 10(-3)eV(GPa)(-1) for (BeSe)(1)/(BeTe)(1) and (BeS)(1)/(BeTe)(1), respectively. The variation of the static dielectric constant with pressure is discussed.

AB We present the results of molecular dynamics (MD) studying of bubble nucleation in binary Lennard-Jones (LJ) solutions modelling a methane-nitrogen system. The mean lifetime method is used in systems containing 12000-1024000 LJ particles at temperatures T * = k(B)T/epsilon(11) = 0.85, 1.0 and 1.1 to determine the dependence of the nucleation rate J on the pressure and concentration of a solution. The results of simulation are compared with classical nucleation theory (CNT). The effect of the size of a critical bubble and its composition on the value of surface tension is discussed.

AB Ni-MCM-41 nanocomposites were prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis with different Ni contents. Various characterization techniques were conducted in order to study the properties of the materials. H-2 storage capacity and degradation of atrazine by heterogeneous photo-Fenton-like process were studied. The results indicated that the structural, chemical, adsorption and catalytic properties of the resulting materials strongly depend on the hydrothermal treatment days and the nickel content. The increase in the Si/Ni molar ratio leads to higher presence of nickel oxide and increment in hydrothermal treatment days favours the Ni incorporation inside mesoporous walls, decreasing the accessibility to the active sites.

AB Graphene conducive pastes are poised to apply in making flexible electronics via a screen-printing way because of its excellent electrical and mechanical properties. In this paper, a new formulation of a pristine graphene-based paste was presented consisting of the conducive filler of graphene, a mixed solvent of terpineol, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, cyclohexanone, and the auxiliaries of ethyl cellulose, Span-85 and 1,4-butyrolactone. The paste containing 20 wt% of the graphene was prepared and showed excellent dispersibility and stability. The screen-printed patterns on a polyimide substrate achieved a high conductivity of 9 x 10(4) S/m and had excellent mechanical flexibility.

AB Kinetics of rubidium extraction by 4-tert-butyl-2-(alpha-methylbenzy) phenol (t-BAMBP)/sulfonated kerosene in brine solutions were investigated using the rising single drop technique. Parameters affecting the mass transfer mechanism, including the interfacial area, initial alkalinity of aqueous phase, concentration of rubidium ions and t-BAMBP, and temperature were studied. The results indicated that the process of extraction was controlled by the diffusion process, while the chemical reaction occurred at the interfacial area. Dynamic equation of the extraction system, R-e= 2.901 x 10(-5) [Rb+](1.022)[OH-](1.179)[t-BAMBP](0.991)was obtained by non-linear fitting the experimental data. Moreover, a new mechanism of the rubidium extraction with t-BAMBP/sulfonated kerosene was proposed.

AB Vibrational relaxation and energy redistribution of Zundel cations H5O2+ in acetonitrile and neat water are studied by femtosecond infrared pump-probe spectroscopy with resonant excitation of the 1200 cm(-1) proton transfer mode. Transient spectra in a range from 1000 to 2200 cm(-1) reveal intermode anharmonic couplings and a sub-100 fs decay of the proton transfer mode, followed by femtosecond vibrational redistribution within the cations' vibrational manifold and picosecond energy transfer to the solvent. Energy transfer to an aqueous environment occurs on the same time scale as within neat water, demonstrating the strong coupling of cations and water solvation shell.

AB The gas-phase hydrolyses of CF3COF catalyzed by water have been theoretically investigated at the CBS-QB3 level, in which up to four water molecules are considered explicitly and the effect of water bulk solvent is also considered within the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Both stepwise and concerted pathways are identified for hydrolyses of CF3COF, which are competitive with the increasing number of the water molecules. The activation Gibbs free energies are decreased from about 40 kcal mol(-1) to 20 kcal mol(-1) due to the catalytic effect of water molecules.

AB Using the available crystallographic data in combination with DFT calculations we investigate the template effect of adamantane on the self-assembly of a tetrahedron-like complex made of four star-shaped building blocks. The QTAIM analysis reveals the presence of bond paths associated to stabilizing CH - pi and H - H interactions. The terminal hydrogen atoms of adamantane do stabilize the electric dipole moments of the intermediate complexes which are likely to be formed along the self-assembly pathway that leads to the formation of the molecular tetrahedron.

AB The first principles calculations were performed to obtain the ideal work of separation (W-sep), electronic structure and the bonding nature of the AlN(0 0 0 1)/Ti(0 0 01) interface. Taking into account two terminations of AlN(0 0 01) and different stacking sequences, six possible interface models were investigated. The W-sep and interfacial distance indicated (d(0)) that terminated structure and stacking sequence both played a significant role on the interfacial stability. Moreover, the N-terminated interfaces with TL stacking sequence presented larger W-sep and shorter d(0) than other structures. Furthermore, the electronic structure suggested that the strongest covalent interfacial bond is largely affected by the N-p and Ti-d hybridizations.

AB In this study, the optimization geometric and optoelectronic properties of new structures that based on quater [1,3,4]thiadiazole and benzothiophene were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TDDFT) at B3LYP and the 6-31G(d) basis set. The total energy, orbital (HOMO, LUMO) distributions, the energy gaps, the maximum open circuit voltage, maximum wavelength absorption, vertical absorption energies, and oscillator strengths have been investigated and discussed. We studied and discussed effect the donor group substituents (COH, and CP) and the acceptor group substituents (Br, OH, Cl, F, and CN) on optimization geometric, electronic properties, and optical properties the molecules, we observed that the donor group substituents lead to decrease energy gap and the acceptor group substituents lead to increase energy gap. These changes give alteration of maximum wavelengths absorption from 453.1 to 559.9 nm. Therefore, these compounds have major absorption bands inside the solar spectrum, to give a present better performance for the solar cells and photovoltaic devices.

AB The adsorption of conjugated molecules on graphene is an attractive way of developing new two-dimensional materials with tailored properties. We investigate here the adsorption of metal-based porphyrins on graphene. The energetics of adsorption of different metalloporphyrins are explored and the electronic properties are analyzed, showing calculated band gaps in good agreement with previous reports. Then, we address the design of adsorbates to give better adsorption and band gaps. We show that adsorption depends on both the atomic radius and the d-orbital occupancy. The band gaps obtained correlate with the proximity of the 3d orbitals to the Fermi level.

AB A novel self-heating hydrogen gas sensor based on zinc oxide nanorods coated on indium fin oxide was fabricated. This sensor utilizes Joule heating effect of indium fin oxide to generate heat, while ZnO acts as a variable resistor to regulate the amount of electric current that passes through indium fin oxide layer upon exposure to oxygen and hydrogen gas. The gas sensor was capable of detecting very low concentration of H-2 in air. Hence, for the first time, a new way of gas detection based on sensor temperature variation as the sensing mode was demonstrated.

AB In this work, we have successfully synthesized pure-phase bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) particles through chemical co-precipitation route with composite precipitants. The TG-DSC suggests select 600 degrees C as calcination temperature. The X-ray diffraction pattern confirms the perovskite structure of BFO. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image shows that the particle size of BFO lies between 100 and 150 nm. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra shows the band gap energy of the BFO samples is less than 2.2 eV. In addition, methyl orange was chosen as a dye water pollution to evaluate its degradation by as-synthesized BFO particles under visible light irradiation. The photocatalysis results reveal that the degradation efficiency of 97.06% to methyl orange occurred with BFO particles prepared with NH3 center dot H2O/NH4HCO3 equal to 1:1 under visible light irradiation.

AB A three-dimensional carbon nanotube-silica coated reduced graphene oxide hybrid (CNT-SiO2@RGO) was synthesized by floating-catalyst chemical vapor deposition (CVD), in which ferrocene was used as catalyst precursor and acetylene as carbon source. Graphene oxide (GO) was selected as the template and was pre-treated by tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) to deposit a SiO2 layer on both sides of the platelet surface. The obtained hybrid has a uniform structure consisting of a platelet sandwiched by vertically aligned CNTs. The CNT length can be well controlled by the variation of growth time.

AB We report laser ablation experiments on polished 4H-SiC wafers using an 193 nm ArF laser over a fluence range of mJ cm(-2) -5000 mJ cm(-2). An onset of material modification was measured at a laser fluence of 925 +/- 80 mJ cm(-2,) and a concomitant etch rate of similar to 200 pm per pulse. Laser ablation sites have been analysed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman microscopy and white light interferometry. Finite element simulations using COMSOL (TM) Metaphysics, 5.3 have been used to calculate laser induced temperature rise of 4H-SiC as a function of laser fluence. The laser fluence required to reach the melting points of silicon, silicon carbide and carbon have been calculated and correspond to similar to 970, 1950, 2600 mJ cm(-2) respectively. Two different surface modifications are observed. At a laser fluence in the region of 1.0 J cm(-2) the irradiated site removed material forming a uniform crater. At a higher laser fluence, in the region of 2700 mJ cm(-2), nodule-like structures form on the base of the ablation crater. The dissociation of laser irradiated 4H-SiC is briefly discussed.

AB A series of hetero-binuclear superhalogen anions involving cyanide and/or isocyanide ligands have been theoretically characterized. Large VDEs (5.831-8.409 eV) confirm the superhalogen nature of these anions. A smaller M or a larger M' central atom can bring a larger VDE value to such anions. The LiMgL4--B (L = CN/NC) isomer possesses the largest VDE value because its extra electron is evenly shared by the three bridging L ligands. For the other anions, the isomers possess relatively larger VDE values when the extra electron is localized on the terminal cyanide instead of isocyanide ligand.

The high-resolved absorption and fluorescence spectra were simulated in the framework of the Herzberg-Teller approximation with the inclusion of the normal mode mixing effect. The simulated spectra were in accordance with the experimental findings. Our theoretical simulations allowed to identify the experimental bands and to assign them to the specific vibrational transitions. The individual Herzberg-Teller and Duschinsky effects were investigated separately and their respective contribution on the vibrational intensity changes of different normal modes were clarified.

Dual emission from locally excited (LE) and intramolecular charge transfer (CT) excited states was observed. The LE/CT relative magnitude is sensitive to solvent polarity and linker length. In water, the CT or LE state is favoured for short chain or long chain probes, respectively. The LE/CT relative magnitude also depends on the CD type: 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-CD favours the CT state, while beta- and gamma-CD stabilise the LE state.

AB Ga-doped and undoped SnO2 porous microflowers (SPMs) were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The presence of Ga in the SPMs and their structure was determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Compared with the pure SPM sensor, the 3 wt% Ga-doped SPM sensor exhibits a lower detection limit (3.0/ 0.1 ppm) and improved sensitivity (95.8/50 ppm) to formaldehyde at 230 degrees C, which is 4.5 times greater than the pure SPM sensor (21.2/50 ppm).

AB It has been shown that the carbon soot produced as a byproduct of partial oxidation of methane consists of carbon nanoparticles of almost ideal spherical morphology and perfect concentric onion-like structure. The particles are unusually big for carbon onions and have outer diameter of 10-50 nm while the inner cage is rather typical for onions and has diameter below 1 nm. The concentric graphitic structure and spherical symmetry along with the absence of amorphous carbon are confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, EDX spectroscopy and Raman investigation. The spherical particles get deposited on a wall of a partial oxidation reactor as loose particles embedded in a low density organic ovary, which can be detected by its luminescence or by cautious electron microscopy imaging. It is important that unlike literature reports on giant onions, the carbon deposit was dominated by these giant spheres. This process may be considered as a prototype for a production method for giant concentric shell carbon particle black.

AB Collagen is composed of three chains, which wind into triple helices. As there are high percentages of acidic and basic residues in natural collagen, mechanisms of how salt bridges could modulate the trimerization have been received much attention. Sixteen pairwise salt bridges were constructed in a collagen heterotrimer abc, making an energetic-contribution library for collagen stability. The local stability of type I collagen was predicted from the library. Separation between the stabilizing and ligand-binding regions of type I collagen suggests that there be a balance between overall stability to maintain triple helices and local instability relevant to biological functions.

AB In this study, Ag nanoparticles were green synthesized and a novel nano Ag doped zeolite A modified carbon ceramic electrode (AgZA-CCE) was fabricated. It was applied for the determination of rutin with high sensitivity. A substantial (550 mV) decrease in the overvoltage of rutin oxidation reaction was observed using the AgZA-CCE. The calibration graph was linear over the concentration range of 0.005-0.21 mu M and the detection limit was estimated 0.47 nM. The resulted diffusion coefficient was equal to 4.22 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) . The proposed electrode was used for the determination of rutin in real samples with satisfactory results.

AB This work aims to probe isomeric effect in case of positron scattering. In this pursuit, we have chosen pentane (C5H12) as the target molecule. The structural isomers of pentane offers a perfect prototype to investigate isomeric effect and thus may give further knowledge into the role of the geometrical arrangements of atoms in a target molecule during the positron scattering process. The grand total, integral elastic and differential cross section are reported using the modified spherical complex optical potential (mSCOP) method. The cross sections do not exhibit isomeric effect, which is in accordance with the experimental observation.

AB The interpretation of the conversion patterns of molecular hydrogen adsorbed on amorphous solid water confirms the electromagnetic nature of the process. Magnetic spin-orbit coupling and hyperfine contact introduce some electron spin-orbital excitation in the H-2-ASW ground state. The molecule-solid electron repulsion evacuates the H-2 rotation momenta. The theoretical rates fit the experimental ones in magnitude and steep temperature dependence. Fundamental discussion focus on the role of the surface electric field and on the dissipation of the rotational energy by the solid phonons.
