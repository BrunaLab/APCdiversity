AB We present a reduced basis technique for long-time integration of parametrized incompressible turbulent flows. The new contributions are threefold. First, we propose a constrained Galerkin formulation that corrects the standard Galerkin statement by incorporating prior information about the long-time attractor. For explicit and semi-implicit time discretizations, our statement reads as a constrained quadratic programming problem where the objective function is the Euclidean norm of the error in the reduced Galerkin (algebraic) formulation, while the constraints correspond to bounds for the maximum and minimum value of the coefficients of the N-term expansion. Second, we propose an a posteriori error indicator, which corresponds to the dual norm of the residual associated with the time-averaged momentum equation. We demonstrate that the error indicator is highly-correlated with the error in mean flow prediction, and can be efficiently computed through an offline/online strategy. Third, we propose a Greedy algorithm for the construction of an approximation space/procedure valid over a range of parameters; the Greedy is informed by the a posteriori error indicator developed in this paper. We illustrate our approach and we demonstrate its effectiveness by studying the dependence of a two-dimensional turbulent lid-driven cavity flow on the Reynolds number. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we develop a conservative interface-interaction method dedicated to simulating multiple compressible fluids with sharp interfaces. Numerical models for finite-volume cells cut by more than two material-interface are proposed. First, we simplify the interface interaction inside such a cell to avoid the need for explicit interface reconstruction and very complex flux calculation. Second, conservation is strictly preserved by an efficient conservation correction procedure for the cut cell. To improve robustness, a multi-material scale separation model is developed to remove consistently non-resolved interface scales. In addition, a multi-resolution method and a local time-stepping scheme are incorporated into the proposed multi-material method to speed up high-resolution simulations. Various numerical test cases, including the multi-material shock tube problem, inertial confinement fusion implosion, triple-point shock interaction and shock interaction with multi-material bubbles, show that the method is suitable for a wide range of complex compressible multi-material flows.

We give a systematic description of a new treatment of void closure in the framework of the multimaterial arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods. This includes a new formulation of the interface-aware sub-scale-dynamics (IA-SSD) closure model for multimaterial cells with voids, which is used in the Lagrangian stage of our indirect ALE scheme.
   The results of the comprehensive testing of the new model are presented for one- and two-dimensional multimaterial calculations in the presence of voids. We also present a sneak peek of a realistic shaped charge calculation in the presence of voids and solids. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID IMMERSED BOUNDARY METHOD; ELLIPTIC-EQUATIONS; FLOW SIMULATIONS;

AB Numerical methods for solving the flow around a moving or deforming membrane are developed by employing the ideas of the direct-discretisation of the Navier-Stokes equation even in the immediate vicinity of the object surface and consistent-discretisation of the pressure Poisson equation with the incompressible velocity field (i.e., consistent-coupling) that incorporates the boundary conditions on the surface to the pressure equation. Comparative study of three different discretisation strategies is carried out to highlight the effect of the consistent and direct discretisations. The validity of the present "consistent direct discretisation" is established through comparisons with the analytical solutions for some fundamental shear-driven 2-D flow fields with a moving membrane of flat and corrugated geometries. Also, the flows induced by a membrane of circular geometry (i.e., particle) are compared with the reference numerical results under prescribed motion in a stationary fluid as well as lateral migration in a shear flow. A three dimensional problem is presented for an interaction problem between a spherical particle and Taylor-Green vortices, and the result is verified by comparing with the independently-conducted numerical results. Finally, the method is applied to an interaction problem between the fluid and flexible filament showing strong flapping and snapping motions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Two-layer shallow water models present at least two fundamental difficulties that are addressed in the present contribution. The first one is related to the lack of hyperbolicity of most existing models. By considering weak compressibility of the phases, a strictly hyperbolic formulation with pressure relaxation is obtained. It is shown to tend to the conventional two-layer model in the stiff pressure relaxation limit. The second issue is related to the non-conservative terms in the momentum equations. Analyzing the Riemann problem structure, local constants appear precisely at locations where the non-conservative products need definition. Thanks to these local constants, a locally conservative formulation of the equations is obtained, simplifying the Riemann problem resolution through a HLL-type Riemann solver. The method is compared to literature data, showing accurate and oscillation free solutions. Additional numerical experiments show robustness and accuracy of the method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Phase-change materials (PCMs) have been widely used in optical and electronic applications for their extraordinary properties. However, the procedure of fast transition about PCMs is still not clear for the time limit. Pulse laser, especially ultra-short pulse laser, is an excellent tool to study the crystallization characteristics of PCMs for its high heating rate. In this paper, picosecond pulsed laser was employed to study the crystallization of amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 (a-GST) thin films via the evolution of morphology and microstructure. The threshold for inducing crystallization was 7.9 mJ/cm(2) and amorphization occured at 17.2 mJ/cm(2). With the aid of high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), the growth of grains were observed to own a preferable growth direction of [100]. The grain size and laser fluence showed an exponential relationship under the ps laser pulse, and the maximal grain reached to similar to 5 mu m when approaching the melting point. The morphology and grain distribution of GST film under 18.8 mJ/cm(2) indicated a solid-state phase transition. Besides, the matrix of a-GST film changed into crystalline state even though the surface melted into amorphous state when irradiated by high laser pulse. Finally, the reason for fast transition of a-GST film under ultra-short laser pulse was discussed in terms of heating rate and temperature. The present study is fundamental for the understanding of the fast phase transition of PCMs.

AB A relaxed heterogeneous metallic glass is successfully rejuvenated by using a recovery-annealing technique. It is found that the rejuvenation state is related to the final cooling rate and more nano-clusters are formed in the less rejuvenated heterogeneous metallic glass with a slower final cooling rate. Interestingly, the less rejuvenated heterogeneous metallic glass shows better plasticity than the more rejuvenated glass, which may result from the stress-induced crystallization (SIC) during deformation. The reasons for the SIC in the less rejuvenated sample are considered to be the evolution of nano-clusters, a more unstable glassy phase (easier to crystallize), and the high temperature rise in each shear band. These results suggest that not only the relaxation state of the amorphous phase, but also the heterogeneous microstructures, including nano-clusters, should be considered to improve the mechanical properties of metallic glasses.

AB The structural evolutions and thermodynamic and dynamical properties of binary Zr80Pt20 metallic liquid and glass have been studied by classical molecular dynamics simulations. The calculated pair distribution functions at different temperatures agree well with the theoretical and the experimental results. The local atomic ordered structures of liquids and glasses have been characterized by the Honeycutt-Andersen index and Voronoi tessellation. High fractions of Pt-centered full icosahedra clusters (Z12) and Zr-centered icosahedra-like clusters (Z13-Z15) have been detected in both supercooled liquids and glasses, which are likely to be responsible for glass formation in Zr80Pt20 systems. Most of the Pt-centered clusters in the system are icosahedra, suggesting that the presence of Pt promotes the glass-forming ability. The critical temperature of the liquid Zr-Pt system is similar to 1025.42 K from the transport properties using mode coupling theory. At temperatures near the critical value, there is a dynamic crossover. These results show that the molecular dynamics results provide a powerful approach to obtain detailed chemical and topological ordering of metallic glasses and liquids when compared with experimental and theoretical results in the literature.

AB In the present work, the setting reaction of magnesium sodium phosphate cement was followed in time with in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in order to gain insights into the products and phase transformations. The results indicated that, during the progress of the reaction, amorphous phases containing the H2PO4- structural group converted into phases containing HPO42- and finally PO43-. The increase in pH triggered by the MgO dissolution was considered as the driving force for the transformations. This is supposed to promote the establishment of a high degree of supersaturation close to the surface of MgO grains, resulting in kinetically driven transformations and favouring the amorphous nature of the products. It is suggested that in the later stages of the reaction, two orthophosphate amorphous phases, hosting bound water molecules, coexisted, with the one showing a relatively more ordered P-31 local environment, converting into a second with a more disordered phosphorous environment. The densification of the ceramic can be considered as a structural reorganization encompassing bonding of water molecules into a pervasive amorphous phase, containing magnesium-phosphate structural units and involving limited structural rearrangements of the local environment of P and, especially, of Na.

AB Boro-tellurite glass system with different concentrations of Bi2O3 had been prepared and characterized. The FTIR analysis indicated a glass former role of Bi2O3 that was deduced from the formation of [BiO3] structural units. These units transformed the structural units [TeO3] into [TeO4] and [BO3] into [BO4]. This process increased the environment of bridging oxygens that increased the density and decreased the molar volume of the glass structure. The increase of the ultrasonic velocities, the elastic moduli (experimentally determined and theoretically computed according to Makishima-Mackenzie model) with the addition of Bi2O3 was attributed to the increased compactness and rigidity. The increment coordination number increased the cross-link density and improved the glass transition temperature. The hyper-polarizability of Bi3+ due to the d-orbital contribution increased the crystallization peak and enhanced the thermal stability.

AB This work reports on the spectroscopic properties and temperature dependent NIR to visible upconversion of Nd3+ doped barium bismuth tellurite glasses. Raman spectrum analysis was performed to predict the maximum phonon energy. Spectroscopic parameters (Omega 2, Omega 4, Omega 6 and chi) and radiative properties of certain transitions of Nd3+ ions were calculated by applying Judd-Ofelt (J-O) theory. The concentration dependence of NIR emission and visible upconversion intensities of various levels were discussed. Decrease in the experimental lifetime of Nd3+: F-4(3/2) level with increase of Nd3+ ion concentration has also been discussed by analysing decay curves of the NIR emission. The variation of upconversion spectral intensities with respect to sample temperature was studied. Thermal quenching was observed in all the upconversion bands and no anomalous variations were observed in the temperature range 14-300 K.

AB In the present work, we develop a series of binary Cu-Zr thin film metallic glasses (TFMGs) with tunable nanoscale structures by using direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering technique. Depending on the chemical composition and the sputtering parameters, Cu-Zr TFMGs show variable nanoscale structures from nanocolumn to nanogranula. As compared to the metallic glassy ribbons with identical composition, the Cu-Zr TFMGs with nanoscale structures exhibit novel and unique thermal and mechanical properties. From nanoindentation study, it is found that the TFMGs with nanoscale structures display obvious reduced hardness (about 48-52%) and increased elastic modulus (about 7-23.8%) as compared to the metallic glassy ribbons. Moreover, the serrated flow behavior, as commonly observed from the load-displacement response in the nanoindentation of metallic glasses (MGs) is absence for nanostructured TFMGs, indicating the profound effects of nanoscale structural features on the plastic yielding and flow in TFMGs. This study provides a detail insight into a strategy of designing nanostructured TFMGs and obtaining tunable properties which is of great interest in the potential application of micro/nanoscale devices.

AB Glass samples of cordierite composition Mg2Al4Si5O18, increasingly doped with TiO2 as nucleating agent, were ceramized up to 1300 degrees C and analyzed to highlight differences in their crystalline evolution. Employed analytical methods included HT-XRD, DSC and Raman spectroscopy. Glass-ceramics displayed a gradual transition to effective bulk crystallization with increasing TiO2-doping, manifested by earlier and sharper formation of MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 solid solutions of high-quartz structure. The further phase transformation into indialite equally appeared to be influenced by TiO2-content and to be closely related to the compositional and structural evolution of the seed formers, Mg-Al-titanate and rutile. Furthermore, the indialite-cordierite ordering process was investigated by computation of the ordering index at various temperatures from XRD and Raman, again revealing marked differences between TiO2-free and TiO2-bearing compositions.

AB The radiation shielding performance of tellurite tungsten glasses with different antimony oxide (Sb2PO3) content was studied using Monte Carlo simulation MCNPX and WinXCOM software. The mass attenuation coefficients were computed for photon energies of 0.662, 1.173, 1.274 and 1.332 MeV. Moreover, The transmission factor of the selected glasses was calculated at a different thickness from the incident and transmitted photons. It was found that the transmission factor of the investigated glasses lies within 0.11-0.28 range. Also, it was found that the MCNPX and WinXCOM results were matched with each other. It can also be concluded that the high density TSW5 glass sample has the maximum shielding effect over the other samples because of the high weight fraction of the highest atomic numbers (i.e. W, Z = 74) as well as its high density.

AB The short-range order (SRO) structures of glasses in the Na4P2S7-x,O-x, 0 <= x <= 7 system were investigated on samples prepared by planetary ball milling (PBM). Like other glasses prepared by PBM, the glassy nature of the prepared materials was confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) showing that they were structurally amorphous and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showing that each composition exhibited a reproducible glass transition temperature (Tg). The SRO structure of these glasses were determined using a combination of Raman, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), and P-31 Magic Angle Spinning NMR (MAS NMR) spectroscopies to investigate how oxygen and sulfur are bonded in the various SRO structural units that were found in these glasses. The three spectroscopic techniques gave further evidence that the resulting glasses were completely reacted from their starting polycrystalline materials Na2S, P2S5 and P2O5. It was found that significant disproportionation reactions occur in these compositions in which the original as-batched and expected pyro-phosphate SRO units, P-1 = 2 Na/P, for x = 0 undergo a transformation to form charge compensated amounts of ortho-phosphate (P-0, 3 Na/P) and meta-phosphate (P-2, 1 Na/P) SRO structures with increasing x such that there is a conservation of N+ charge, on average 2Na/P. In this nomenclature, the superscript is the total number of bridging sulfurs (BSs) and bridging oxygens (BOs), three minus the superscript is the number of Na per P, and four minus the superscript is the total number of non-bridging sulfurs (NBSs) and non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) on each of the SRO units. As seen in earlier work on other mixed oxy-sulfide (MOS) glass forming systems, the stronger Lewis base O-=, compared to S-=, is found to preferentially form BOs in the form of P-2 units by bonding to the stronger Lewis acid P+5, compared to Na+ . This leaves the weaker Lewis base S-= to bond to the weaker Lewis acid, N-+,N- in the form of NBSs on the charge compensation required P-0 groups. Using both charge balance and quantitative P-31 MAS NMR measurements, a complete composition map of all of the SRO structures present in these glasses has been determined.

While the base glass was selected from SiO2-Na2O-CaO-P2O5 system (commercially available S53P4 glass), four B2O3 modified glass compositions were formulated by replacing SiO2 in the base glass composition by B2O3 with 25, 50, 75 and 100%. To understand the amorphous nature of the glasses as well as the structural changes in the glasses, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were performed, respectively. The thermal behaviour of the glasses were analysed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and an improvement in the glass stability factor (AT), was observed at optimized B2O3 concentration. The apatite formation on the surfaces of glasses after bioactivity study for various time periods was analysed using XRD and FTIR. A gradual increase in the pH value and ion concentration (e.g. Ca2+, B3+) in simulated body fluid (SBF) was observed along with faster apatite formation with gradual increase in B2O3 substitution. The in vitro cell proliferation studies using MTT assay demonstrate that the cell proliferation was better on the glasses (BG1B, BG2B and BG3B) compared to base glass (BGOB). Antibacterial study was performed using broth microdilution method against Escherichia con (E. coil) bacteria exploring the antibacterial effects of these glasses from which B2O3 substituted glasses were observed to exhibit improved antibacterial properties compared to base glass (BGOB).

AB At first, a granulated aerogel of graphene oxide was obtained, which was later reduced by hydrazine vapour. The reduced aerogel was characterized through elemental analysis, infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), voltammetry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the reduced sample was found to contain approximately 3 wt.% of nitrogen, which was present in the aerogel in three states corresponding to the photoelectron peaks Nls with binding energies of 399.5, 401.3, and 403.6 eV. In the electroreduction of oxygen, an appreciable catalytic effect was observed for the sample under study, which resulted from reducing the overvoltage of the reaction by similar to 90 mV and changing the mechanism of reduction.

AB Mixed barium-strontium Nd:phosphate glasses of composition: 58P(2)O(5)-13K(2)O-8Al(2)O(3)-4B(2)O(3)-2.5La(2) O-3-2SiO(2)-0.5Nd(2)O(3)-12(Ba1-x/SrxO) with a different degree of molar substitution x were prepared. Optical properties of these glasses were examined by UV-Vis-IR and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. Considering IR spectra, it was suggested a certain contribution of oxygen defects in the optical properties of glasses. UV-Vis absorbance and PL emission spectra owing to the internal f-f electron transitions of Nd3+ ions were shown a complex character of electronic processes. The result of a comprehensive analysis of the optical scattering indicatrices has revealed non-monotonic variations of the scattering efficiency against the ratio of Sr to Ba that is correlated with the suggested content of the oxygen defects in the mixed glasses. A cubic nonlinear optical (NLO) response under the pulsed laser radiation self-action at 1064 nm shows that the self-defocusing effect increases with the molar fraction of Ba. For a continuous wave laser excitation at 1064 nm, the most efficient NLO refractive response with Re(chi((3))) = 2.9 x 10(-3) esu was obtained in the pure strontium Nd:phosphate glass, being classified as a promising for NLO applications.

Thermal stability parameter (Delta T) extracted from DSC thermograms reveals that the Delta T (> 100 degrees C) depends on Er2O3 content and the glasses are suitable for fiber drawing process. Optical properties of both the investigated glass systems exhibit composition dependent trends and the properties are critically dependent on polarizabilities and ionicity of the dopant ions. The variations observed in the physical properties of investigated glasses were correlated to the structural changes occur due to the addition of BiCl3/Er2O3. B-11 MAS NMR studies reveal the opening up of a tightly bound [B4O7](2-) structural units with the formation of NBOs in the network. The variation of N-4 (fraction of 4-coordinated boron to the total boron content) with BiCl3/Er2O3 clearly indicates the presence of different proportion of 3- and 4-coordinated borons in the glass network.

AB Crystallization kinetics of Cu47Zr47Al6 and (Cu47Zr47Al6)(99)Sn-1 bulk metallic glasses in the non-isothermal and isothermal conditions were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In non-isothermal condition, the crystallization activation energy was determined by various methods, and the Sn-containing glassy alloy showed higher crystallization activation energy than that of the base alloy, that means the Sn addition delayed crystallization transformation. In the isothermal condition, the Sn-containing BMG shows longer incubation time and wider crystallization transformation peak than that of the Sn free sample alloy, at the same annealing temperature. The time-temperature-transformation (ITT) diagram signified that the Sn addition delayed the crystallization and consequently improved the GFA. In isothermal conditions, the Avrami exponents vary from 3.75 to 5.31 and 3.88 to 4.08 for Cu47Zr47Al6 and (Cu47Zr47Al6)(99)Sn-1 BMGs, respectively. According to Avrami's model, these numbers indicate that the crystallization of both glassy alloys is governed by three-dimensional growth with an increasing nucleation rate, while Sn addition decreases the nucleation rate.

AB Laser-induced defects in glasses are of considerable interest for many applications from optics to photonics. The importance of low-level impurities of polyvalent ions in aiding defect formation has been identified early on. (Fluoride-)phosphate glasses are used today as laser materials, waveguides, amplifiers and luminescing materials, all sensitive to a change of the materials transmission by the interaction with light during application. To better understand the processes of defect generation and recovery, a systematic comparison of defect formation in various glasses and for various radiation sources and dopants has been conducted over the last decades. Here we will focus on (fluoride-) phosphate glasses doped with 50 to 5000 ppm of the 4d and 5d ions Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo and W. Glasses were melted under air or under reducing conditions in order to shift the redox equilibrium of the dopants before irradiation with either the 193 nm or 248 nm excimer laser. Only for W, Mo and Nb reduced ion species were confirmed by optical and/or ESR spectroscopy in the pre-irradiated glasses. However, irradiation showed for all metaphosphates the presence of reduced dopant species (W5+, Mo5+, Ta4+, Nb4+, Zr3+), acting as extrinsic hole centers (HC) after being photo-oxidized by laser irradiation to the fully oxidized d ions (Mn+)(+)-HC. Only for Ta5+ with its (Ta5+)(-)-electron center (EC), photo-reduction to the tetravalent ion was observed. Defect recovery was followed up to 16 years after the irradiation experiments, showing that most (Mn+)(+)-HC were very stable, while intrinsic HC either recombined with EC or converted into extrinsic (Mn+)(+)-HC. Due to ubiquitous iron impurities, even these high purity glasses with iron levels of 5-10 ppm or less, showed the formation of (Fe2+)(+)-HC.

AB As cast and heat treated samples in the xCu(100-x)[ZnO center dot 2TeO(2)] system with 0 <= x <= 20 mol% were prepared and investigated by X-ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), UV-VIS and infrared (IR) spectroscopies. The as cast samples were vitreous while the heat treated ones became crystalline. For the heat treated samples, the main crystalline phase is the Zn2Te3O8. Increasing the CuO content of these samples up to x = 10 mol% produce the occurrence of zinc tellurium oxide and copper telluride crystalline phases. For x = 20 mol% CuO the sample contains a mixture of phases, namely copper telluride, zinc tellurium oxide and tellurium copper oxide. EPR data show the presence of the Cu2+ ions located at sites with an axially distorted octahedral symmetry, as both isolated and coupled species. These data offer information concerning the evolution of the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ during the melting of samples. UV Vis data support the assumption concerning the presence of copper ions in the two mentioned valence states. The IR data suggest that increasing the copper content of samples determines the breaking of Te-O bonds from both TeO4 and TeO3 structural units while for the heat treated samples increases the structural disorder and the degree of deformation of the basic structural units.

AB Biomaterials surface modification represents a very attractive tool to modulate host tissue response. Surface modifications of titanium for bone contact applications have been widely investigated, while only few papers can be found regarding modifications aimed at soft tissue contact. However, soft tissue healing represents a crucial step for percutaneous/transmucosal titanium implants success. Fibroblasts, the soft tissues most representative cells, are known to be sensitive to surface topography. Anyhow, fibroblasts adhesion and spread can be more influenced by the presence of attractive macromolecules; so, within a grooved and keratin-coated Ti surface, cells will align following the strongest biochemical guide provided by keratin submicrometric-fibers. In order to obtain the most effective cell stimulation/guidance keratin submicrometric-fibers should be aligned to substrate nanogrooves. Despite the very promising cells guidance provided by keratin submicrometric-fibers, the strong limitation to their synthesis is related to the macromolecules high sensitivity to environmental parameters (temperature/humidity/pH) which can seriously compromise the feasibility and reproducibility of the final submicrometric-fibers layer. Accordingly, this work has the aim to obtain, for the first time, a coating of submicrometric keratin fibers aligned to the nanogrooves of a Ti substrate, in order to validate the attitude of the coated surface to impart additive topographical plus biochemical signals in the same direction for the stimulation of fibroblasts repopulation.

ID ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY
AB The advantages of segregated conductive polymer composites are greatly hampered owing to its limited preparation technology, which seriously relies on hot compression with low efficiency. The plunger type injection molding (PTIM) is employed to fabricate segregated carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/high density polyethylene (HDPE)/ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) composites in this paper, which lowers the production cycle by 45%, compared with the conventional hot compression. The morphology and conductive properties are investigated in detail. Graceful segregated conductive network and a very low percolation threshold (0.45 vol%) of the polymer composites have both been achieved. The present processing technique with short production cycle provides a fancy idea to realize segregated conductive polymer composite in mass production. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Selecting suitable electrode materials is the key to develop high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, we report the niobium nitride (NbN) thin films prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering and investigate their electrochemical performances when used as supercapacitor electrodes. NbN thin film electrodes can achieve the optimal electrochemical performance with a volumetric capacitance of 707.1 F cm(3) and an outstanding cycling stability (remaining 92.2% after 20,000 cycles). Such impressive properties render the NbN thin films qualified as the promising candidates for supercapacitors or other energy storage systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile and versatile method for synthesis of novel ammonium vanadium oxide [(NH4)(2)V4O9] sheets is developed by a simple hydrothermal route. It is found that the synthetic conditions play an important role in the successful synthesis of (NH4)(2)V4O9 sheets, and the favorable condition is NH(4)Vo(3)/H2C2O4 center dot 2H(2)O = 1/1 at 180 degrees C for 48 h. (NH4)(2)V4O9 sheets exhibit the square-like shape with several nanometers in thickness, BET specific surface area of 16 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 0.16 cm(3) g(-1) Electrochemical properties of (NH4)(2)V4O9 sheets are firstly investigated as supercapacitor electrodes by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). (NH4)(2)V4O9 sheets exhibit electrical storage based on the faradaic mechanism with excellent capacity and rate capability. Specific capacitance of (NH4)(2)V4O9 sheets reaches to 249F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1), suggesting that (NH4)(2)V4O9 sheets can be promising potential as electrode material applied to supercapacitors.

AB A novel adamantane-based polyurethane (AdPU) was synthesized via efficient ring-opening polymerization of 1,3,5,7-tetrahydroxyadamantane with epsilon-caprolactone followed by one-step polymerization of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL2000) with 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). The incorporation of 1,3,5,7-tetrahydroxyadamantane enhanced the thermal stability of AdPU. It was found that AdPU was composed of a crystalline soft phase and an amorphous hard phase; and the aggregation of segments could form nano-sized crystal fibers by controlling the drying conditions. Finally, shape memory effect tests showed that AdPU has thermal-induced shape memory effect with good shape fixation and 85% shape recovery. This work opens a new avenue to design polyurethane frameworks with cubic geometry structure for shape memory applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Resulting cryogels were characterized by SEM, Raman spectroscopy, conductivity and tensile measurements. The addition of small amounts (1 mol%) of 1,3-phenylenediamine into copolymerization with aniline allows for the significant increase of cryogel pore sizes without substantial change in conductivity and mechanical stability.

AB For the first time, it has been investigated if the vitrification of palm biomass wastes that result from conservation works in a protected forest area would be possible. In order to reduce these types of wastes and to exploit their capability for obtaining materials with useful applications, previous chemical analysis and thermal behaviour at high temperatures have been investigated by XRF (X-ray fluorescence) and HSM (hot stage microscopy). Location of these biomass residues in phase diagrams and possible formation of crystalline phases are previoulsy outlined from the XRF chemical analysis and the HSM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present a facile method for designing and manipulating eggshell membrane-based nanowrinkled microfibers (EMNMs) using graphene and a spin-coating technique. Graphene is simply spin-coated on the eggshell membrane to form multiscale structures of nanowrinkled microfibers. We demonstrate that the EMNMs combine the unique properties of the raw eggshell membrane and graphene, such as micro- and nanoscale hierarchical morphologies, specific crystalline structures, and surface wettability. We also show that the properties of the EMNMs can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of graphene. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of elevated temperature compressive deformation of the beryllium-aluminum casting alloy was investigated in the temperature range of 450-660 degrees C and strain rate 0.1-50 s (1). The temperature mainly affects the load bearing ability and flowability of aluminum and thus the compatible plastic deformation of the alloy, while the strain rate mainly affects the work hardening effect and peak stresses. The deformation mechanism was discussed by combining analysis of the stress-strain curves and microstructures. The constitutive equation relating flow stress, strain rate, and deformation temperature of the alloy is established. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper reports a novel ZnO/carbon felt (CF) flexible electrode via a facile solvothermal method. The flexible electrode presents a unique architecture with well-dispersed ZnO nanoparticles on shallow grooves of carbon felt. As a binder-free LIB anode, it exhibits a stable reversible capacity of 5202 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). The improved lithium storage properties can be attributed to the combined effect of both CF matrix and nano-sized embedded ZnO. The shallow grooves of elastic carbon fibers are favorable to accommodate the large volume expansion of ZnO and sustain good cycle stability. Moreover, the conductive network of CF may promote the electrical contact of the flexible electrode, making contribution to the enhanced rate performance. The structure, morphology and the electrochemical performances of ZnO/CF electrode for flexible LIBs are analyzed in details. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Visible-light-driven MnWO4/WO3 photocatalysts with different amount of MnWO4 were successfully synthesized by a facile electrospinning technology. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated by oxidation of methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation. The results showed that 3 mol% MnWO4/WO3 nanofibers exhibited enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of 85% and the degradation constant of 3 mol% MnWO4/WO3 nanofibers was as high as 3.1 times to that of pure WO3 as the irradiation time increasing to 120 min. The cyclic test showed that the 3 mol% MnWO4/WO3 nanofibers had the stable photocatalytic cycle ability. The effect of adding amount of MnWO4 on photocatalytic properties of MnWO4/WO3 nanofibers and the relevant photocatalytic mechanism were investigated. The trapping experiment showed that center dot O-2, center dot OH and h(+) were the major reactive species for the MnWO4/WO3 photocatalytic system. In all, the MnWO4/WO3 photocatalyst is promising for the further practical application of photocatalysis in wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and cellulose nanofiber (CNF) were prepared by chemical and mechanical methods, and their aerogel were fabricated by freeze-drying technology in combination with solvent replacement. The mixed aerogel of CNC and CNF showed better performance than that from pure CNC or CNF. What's more, the mixture ratio of CNC and CNF has great influences on the properties of the prepared aerogel. When the mixture ratio of CNF and CNC was 3:1, the internal of aerogel presents a uniform three-dimensional network structure with abundant pores. It exhibited a higher specific surface area of up to 143 m(2)/g and the compressive strength was 0.202 MPa under 80% strain. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanoscale titanium diborides (TiB2) can be utilized in numerous applications ranging from wear resistant coating to conducting polymers. However, a surface-clean TiB2 nanoparticles with less than 10 nm in size is not currently available in either commercial or literature. Here we report a novel yet scalable synthesis of ultra-fine and uniform size TiB2 nanoparticles (less than 10 nm) by magnesio-reduction of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and boron trioxide (B2O3) in a eutectic lithium chloride/potassium chloride (LiCl/KCl) molten salt. The TiB(2 )nanoparticle is confined to the nanoscale owing to the partial dissolution of magnesium (Mg) and B2O3 in the molten salts which resulted in reduction on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The TiB2 nanoparticles size was statistically determined to be 8.1 +/- 1.4 nm by analyzing transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images obtained from several samples. High resolution TEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) study confirm the presence of the surface-clean TiB2 nanoparticles. This novel, simple, and scalable approach has a tremendous potentials for large volume production of ultrafine TiB2 nanoparticles to serve wide range of industries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This results in that there are no reports on the deformation twinning of FTs from a single crystal. In this study, deformation twinning of an FT is performed from a single crystal, which is induced on the surface of an alloy under nanoindentation. The origin and evolution of an FT is elucidated on the surface of a nickel alloy. Incoherent twin boundaries (ITBs) play the most important role during the formation of an FT. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Controllable three-dimensional villose titanium dioxide architectures grown on carbon textiles are fabricated by a facile one-step in situ hydrothermal method at low temperatures. It has in fact been proven to be an effective method to reduce self-aggregation and promote lithium-ion intercalate/extract via building 3D architectures based on 2D conductive materials. More importantly, the freestanding electrodes without any addition of conductive agents and polymeric binders reveal significant improvement in high-rate capacity and cycling performance.

ID POWDER; MECHANISM; COMPACTS
AB In order to understand the underlying mechanisms of rapid densification during spark plasma sintering (SPS), the texture evolution of tungsten at different current densities was analyzed. It is found that texture of sample changes with current density under the same pressure and temperature. As the current density increases, the preferred orientation of tungsten crystal tend to rotate from (1 3 3) and (1 1 1) to (0 0 1), which is exactly a soft orientation and has the smallest deformation resistance. This current-induced rotation of crystal can be regarded as a non-thermal mechanism of electric current which contributes to the rapid densification of tungsten powder during SPS.

ID POROUS GRAPHITE
AB Ultrafine layered graphite was prepared by jet impinging apparatus to reduce the size of graphite. The results showed that graphite formed a unique assembled structure with more exposed gaps and defects. As the anode material for lithium ion batteries, the ultrafine layered graphite showed a lower diffusion resistance compared with traditional graphite. In addition, ultrafine layered graphite electrodes displayed a higher reversible capacity of 393 mAh g(-1 )compared to the 345 mAh g(-1) of traditional graphite electrodes and offered better cycling performance, retaining 78% of the initial reversible capacity after 800 cycles at rate 5 C. This exciting discovery based on decreasing graphite particle diameter may provide some novel ideas for improving the performance of graphite electrodes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RELEASE
AB The formation of neovascularization inside the bone scaffold could enhance and accelerate the regeneration of large bone defects in femoral head necrosis, the angiogenic growth factors are predominantly expressed during the early phase for a reestablishment of the vascularity. In this paper, the injectable temperature-sensitive star-shaped poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-mPEG) block copolymer was developed, during the sol-gel transition process, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) loaded linear PLGA-mPEG block copolymer microspheres and vascular endothelial cells (VECs) were composited into to form hydrogels. The release of VEGF from hydrogel was delayed compared to that from microspheres. The fluorescent imaging confirmed that VECs had a good proliferation into the hydrogels. The hydrogels were injected into necrosis site of the femoral head, the vessels were observed for 2 weeks, the vessels density and mean vessels diameters increased in next 4-6 weeks, followed by increasing new bone formation. These results suggested that injectable VEGF loaded microspheres/hydrogels composites could be applied for vascularization and bone regeneration of femoral head necrosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, Ni2N thin film composed of aligned nanorods with surface configuration of diamond-shaped bulges was fabricated on nickel foam by reactive magnetron sputtering. The Ni2N thin film electrode exhibited high electrocatalytic HER performance with a low overpotential of 159 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(2) in 1 M KOH without iR-correction and was durable in 6 h of chronoamperometry test at an overpotential of 150 mV.

The structural, chemical composition, morphological, optical, magnetic properties as well as possible transformation mechanism were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm that the tetragonal gamma-Fe2O3 phase with lattice parameters a = 8.3477 angstrom and c = 25.1823 angstrom was prepared. For the phase transformation process, the mixture of iron oxide scale and NaOH formed intermediate alpha-NaFeO2 in the calcined process, then the structure of FeO4 was generated in the hydrolysis procedure. The prepared y gamma-Fe2O3 have saturation magnetization of 9.03 emu/g and coercivity 322.8 Oe. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hybrid halide perovskite is attracting attention as an alternative solar cell material, but the air instability of perovskite is still a major research problem. The current work investigates how air degradation affects the crystal size, surface morphology, and mechanical hardness of the perovskite. Interestingly, we found that the crystal sizes of perovskite, PbI2 and I-2 extracted from XRD measurements exhibited a dynamic variation with exposure to air. Particularly, it was found that the elastic modulus and hardness of the perovskite films increased for a 20 h exposure to air and then gradually decreased due to chemical decomposition and formation of pinholes in the perovskite film.

AB New perovskite type orange red emitting phosphors, SrGd(0.5 x)Nb0.5O3: xEu(3+) were synthesized using a high temperature solid state reaction method. Powder XRD results confirm the orthorhombic perovskite type phase and detailed investigations on the photoluminescence and UV absorption studies indicated that Eu3+ doped SrGd0.5Nb0.5O3 phosphors has a strong absorption in the UV region. Intense orange red emission is observed for both near UV (392 nm) and blue (465 nm) excitations matching with the output wavelengths of UV and blue LED chips, which can be attributed to the magnetic and electric dipole transitions (D-5(0)-F-7(1.2)) of Eu3+. The emission intensity of phosphor under UV excitation is found to be much greater compared to that of blue excitation. Concentration quenching is observed at 7.5 mol% Eu3+ doping. The prepared intense orange red emitting phosphor with higher quantum efficiency could be a promising candidate for white light emitting diode applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A synergistic effect of surface plasmons (SPs) and surface passivation on ZnO thin film optical performance was studied. The ZnO thin film of thickness of ca. 40 nm was deposited on Al concave arrays with a period (D-c) of about 125, 252, and 340 nm. Next, the Al2O3 coating thickness was tested with respect to UV light enhancement. About 20-fold enhancement of the UV emission was achieved upon simultaneous application of Al concave array with D-c approximate to 340 nm and 10 nm thick Al2O3 coating. Moreover, it was found that the Al concave array with D-c of ca. 125 nm does not sustain the SP resonance in UV region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, uniform octopus-like platinum-copper alloy nanoframes (OPCANs) were exploited as peroxidase mimics for phenol removal. The OPCANs exhibited excellent peroxidase-like catalytic activity with oxidant H2O2. Compared with the natural peroxidase horseradish peroxidase (HRP), OPCANs could catalyze H2O2 over a wider range of temperatures and pH values. Moreover, the OPCANs displayed a splendid phenol removal over 80% after a 30 min period of reaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The unilateral thickening of gamma lamellae during alpha to gamma transformation was investigated by examinations of surface reliefs and atomic steps of gamma lamellae. The results show that the rounded corners of terraces and the steps prefer to form mainly on one side of the gamma lamella, and Shockley partial dislocations with same and with very random Burgers vectors construct the steps. It indicates gamma lamellae grow in a mixture of two scenarios of Shockley partial dislocations. The differences of gamma/alpha interface stability and element concentration on the two sides of gamma lamella contribute to the unilateral thickening. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thermoplastic polyimide (TPI) has a narrow processing temperature range, high viscosity, and high viscous flow temperature (T-f). These properties lead to difficulties in 3D printing and traditional forming with TPI owing to deformation caused by thermal stress, stratification, and other problems. The thermal stability of TPI raw materials and 3D printing filaments were analyzed in this study. Relationships between the T-f of the 3D printing filament and the starting printing temperature were studied. The influence of the 3D printing temperature on the interlayer bonding force of a 3D printed part was studied. The appropriate printing temperature range of TPI 3D printing was found to be 320-340 degrees C. When the printing temperature was 335 degrees C, the interlayer bonding force was 344.5 N. When the printing temperature was 340 degrees C, the interlayer bonding force decreased to 260.5 N. Within the appropriate 3D printing temperature range, complex TPI components with good interlayer bonding and high temperature resistance could be printed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A hierarchical micro/nanostructure with high roughness and a chemical composition with hydrophobicity are both crucial for preparing superamphiphobic substrates with non-wetting and self-cleaning properties. Herein, fluoroalkyl-functionalized silica nanoparticle (F-SiNP) was prepared as a raspberry-like micro/nanostructure. The superamphiphobicity and non-wetting properties of F-SiNP/glass were tested with 4 Newtonian fluids and 2 non-Newtonian fluids. The contact angle of test liquids was almost 180 degrees, and the washing stability sustained during 200 times washing. In addition, the surface free energy of F-SiNP/glass calculated using Owens and Wendt method showed very low, compared to bare glass, revealing the superamphiphobicity feature of F-SiNP/glass.

AB This report demonstrates an effective and large scale producible method to make high performance field emitters using large size graphene oxide (GO) sheets obtain by frozen assisted gradient centrifugation. Most of large size GO sheets had their lateral size about 50 mu m and high quality graphene structure with high 2D peak in Raman spectra after reduction. Screen printing method was introduced to plant the reduced GO sheet (rGS) in buffer layer on silicon substrates. Results indicated the emitters with large size rGS had better performance field emission properties than small size rGS with lower turn-on field reduced from 4 V/mu m to 0.4 V/mu m and higher field emission current increased by more than ten times. This study confirmed the electronic properties of rGS electrodes strongly depend on the lateral size of their precursor GO sheets. And the industrial printing approach will be essential for practical applications of rGS based electronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Development of the novel photocatalyst with outstanding photocatalytic activity is of huge interest for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollution using solar energy. In this work, a new photocatalyst was achieved by CdS nanoparticles decorated K+Ca2Nb3O10 (KCNO) nanosheets. The as-fabricated CdS/KCNO hybrids exhibited well-defined morphology and enhanced photocatalytic activity than pristine KCNO. On the basis of the physicochemical characterization and photocatalytic performance test, it is believed that the CdS nanoparticles can effectively promote the photo-induced charge separation of KCNO nanosheets, and the relative mechanism has been investigated.

AB An acetal-linked porous organic polymer (APOP) was synthesized by the p-toluenesulfonic acid-catalyzed acetalization reaction of 1,4-phthalaldehyde with 1,3,5-tris(3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl)phenyl benzene. The obtained polymer possessed amorphous structure and also exhibited excellent thermal stability, as revealed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The APOP were further characterized by solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The APOP exhibited a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 490 m(2) g(-1) with pore size distribution in the range of mesopores and the pore volume of 0.435 cm(3) g(-1). The resulting polymer displayed the CO2 uptake capacity of 85.7 mg g(-1) at 273 K and 53.7 mg g(-1) at 298 K (1 bar). Furthermore, the iodine adsorption performance of the APOP was also investigated, and it was found that the iodine uptake capacity could reach up to 220 wt%. These results were demonstrated that the APOP should be promising candidate for CO2 and iodine uptake. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, silica aerogels were prepared using water-glass precursor based on two drying strategies, namely conventional freeze drying (C-FD) and spray freeze drying (S-FD). It was known that the pore structure of silica aerogel can be optimized uniformly based on S-FD method when tert-butyl alcohol is directly utilized as a solvent. As a result, silica aerogels obtained by the S-FD method are monolithic with high thermal stability and low thermal conductivity, showing a great potential of thermal insulation materials for high-temperature environment.

Electron microscope techniques indicated that the surfaces of MXenes were densely covered with Fe3O4 nanoparticles of similar to 4.9 nm. Microwave absorption capabilities in terms of the maximum reflection loss (R-L) and effective bandwidth were investigated. Specifically, the TiO2/Ti3C2Tx/Fe(3)O(4)( )exhibited a remarkable absorption performance, with a maximum reflectivity of -57.3 dB at 10.1 GHz and a band range below -10 dB to over 9.1-11.1 GHz at a thickness of 1.9 mm. Therefore, our 2D MXene composites are expected to be promising candidates as ultrathin and lightweight absorbing materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Doping is of key importance in enhancing the electrical transport properties of conducting polymers. Recently, several strategies were employed to optimize the carrier concentration to maximize the power factor of conducting polymers based thermoelectric (TE) materials. Here, we adopted thermal treatment on polyaniline/Te nanorod hybrid films to study the temperature dependent changes in molecular structure, crystallinity, and electrical transport behaviors. The results unambiguously indicated that the carrier concentration would be effectively tuned, and the TE performance was further enhanced via thermal treatment solely. Finally, a 20% increment in power factor has been achieved for the hybrid film treated at 180 degrees C compared with as-prepared film. The study provides a facile route for optimizing TE properties of polymer-based hybrid materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, the combustion properties of treated EP were assessed by cone calorimeter (CONE) and it demonstrated that the EP/PZS-SrSn(OH)(6) obtained better flame retardancy which was confirmed by the reduction of heat release rate (HRR) and total smoke release (TSR). The peak HRR values and TSR for EP/PZS-SrSn(OH)(6) were reduced by 30.2% and 23.1%, respectively. It was confirmed that the core/shell structured PZS-SrSn(OH)(6) could significantly enhance the synergistic effect between PZS and SrSn(OH)(6), and thereby resulting higher flame retardant efficiency.

AB In this study, for the first time, titanium powder recycled from machining swarf was used for cladding a novel Ti-Fe coating on a titanium substrate. Post deposition microstructures revealed a dendritic structure throughout the composite coating followed by a fine martensitic alpha'-Ti phase in the heat affected zone. Additionally, iron in the form of Fe2O3 and Fe2C along with TiC and TiO2 phases were also found which significantly contributed to the very high hardness (620-815 HV) of the coating. This hard composite coating can effectively improve the wear resistance of the titanium alloy, thereby finding applications in the aerospace and defence industries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Preparation of large size, few-layered (FL) 2D materials is one of the challenging problems in material science. In this study, an anisotropic etching method to prepare FL (5-7 layer) MoO3 with width of tens of microns and length exceeding 100 mu m on SiO2 was developed. Anisotropic etching along [100] direction was found to be accelerated in high concentration KOH solution. The first few layer on SiO2 surface kept intact in the first few seconds. The transformation of MoO6 octahedron to MoO4 tetrahedron was suggested to be due to the weak bonding of Mo-O(2) along [100] direction, while the etching speed of the first few layer was slowed down by the interfacial interaction. It's shown that the surface defects were strongly affected by the etching time, and thus the electrical properties could be controlled. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Pt/BiFeO3/La0.5Sr0.5CoO3/STO (Pt/BFO/LSCO/STO) heterojunction capacitors were fabricated on (1 1 0) SrTiO3 (STO) substrates by off-axis RF magnetron sputtering. The structure and physical properties of BiFeO3 thin films were investigated. It was found that the BFO film showed single phase (1 1 0) epitaxial perovskite structure with high crystal quality. The Pt/BFO/LSCO capacitor exhibited a saturated butterfly loop and a stable bipolar resistance switching behavior after post-annealing. The current-voltage characteristic of Pt/BFO/LSCO heterostructure is well explained by the space-charge-limited conduction mechanism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ag NPs with a diameter of 1.8 +/- 0.25 nm were obtained, and exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with an average activity parameter of 0.892 L.mg(-1) .s(-1). Moreover, the Ag NPs remained stable even after storage at 4 degrees C for two months, and the activity could be retained up to 88.3%. Therefore, a feasible, straightforward and effective fabrication of stable and monodispersed Ag NPs was achieved herein.

AB Textured metallic surfaces such as metamaterial provide an increased plasmonic activity which result in localized field enhancement in terahertz frequency range. A simple and novel planar multi-band THz metamaterial with closely spaced band resonance for sensing application is presented. Numerical simulation of the designed structure was done using CST Microwave studio software. A rapid direct writing process using ultrafast laser was adopted for fabricating the proposed multi-band MM structure. The proposed structure displayed band stop characteristics at five frequencies 0.51 THz, 0.56 THz, 0.69 THz, 0.7 THz and 0.79 THz respectively with a loss exceeding 50 dB. A sharp Fano resonance was observed at 0.66 THz frequency from the constructive interference between the resonators. The terahertz transmission characteristic of the fabricated structure was done using THz-TDS technique. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Synthesis of copper sulfide nanoparticles through homogeneous precipitation method and the preparation of Cu2S-chitosan nanocomposites for the removal of Cr(VI) ions from wastewater samples has been achieved. The absorption studies revealed a blue shift in the wavelengths of the band edges when the starch or PVA was introduced into the nanoparticles. The structural studies of the particles were carried out using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The XRD patterns presented the cubic Cu1.8S phase for all the synthesized copper sulfide nanoparticles. TEM images showed spherical shaped particles which became agglomerated when the stabilizers were introduced into the nanomaterial. The adsorption studies proved that the parameters such as pH, dosage and contact time plays an important part during the water treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Austenization and quenching in liquid nitrogen resulted in a Cu/martensite structure, exhibiting tensile strength of 1220 MPa. The electrical conductivity of the wire was measured to be about 60% International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS), which was comparable with Cu/Fe fabricated by alloying and casting. In situ tensile tests under high energy X-ray diffraction were utilized to explore the deformation behavior of the wire. It was found that the martensite carried about 60% of the load, accounting for the high strength. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB V3+ and F co-doped LiFePO4/C cathode materials are prepared via a facile wet milling-spray drying-carbothermal reduction (WSC) process. The obtained products have bowl-like morphologies with the diameters from 5 to 10 mu m, which are composed of numerous nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm integrated by carbon network. The effects of ion doping are studied. V3+ and F co-doped LiFePO4/C shows improved electrochemical performance, which delivers a discharge capacity of 136 mAh.g(-1) (10 C) at 20 degrees C. At 0 degrees C, a capacity of 86 mAh.g(-1) (10 C) can be obtained, which is 20 mAh.g(-1) higher than LiFePO4/C. In addition, the V3+ and F co-doped LiFePO4/C shows excellent cycle performances. The improved performance of V3+ and F co-doped LiFePO4/C is due to the low charge transfer resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and the holes on the surface of particles which can provide more ion transport channel.

AB We proposed a novel Cu-Cu bonding approach by low temperature bonding isopropanol (IPA) stabilized Cu nanoparticles (NPs) in air. The synthesized Cu NPs with the diameter size of about 6.5 nm have good anti-oxidative properties, and IPA has low boiling point (160 degrees C) and reductive ability, providing the favorable conditions for low temperature bonding in air. Consequently, reliable Cu-Cu joints with high strength (>25 MPa) are fabricated after bonding at 250 degrees C and 275 degrees C in air, and the bonded Cu NP layers are copper crystals without oxidation. Moreover, the fracture surfaces of Cu-Cu joints also display obvious ductile deformations and sintering characteristics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB PbS quantum dots (QDs)-CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) heterostructures were fabricated to combine the complementary optical absorption. The heterostructures were deposited onto TiO2 nanotubes (TNTAs) and used as a photoanode of solar cells. The visible absorption of TNTAs was enhanced because of the introduction of PbS QDs, MAPI, and PbS-MAPI heterostructures. With the use of a liquid electrolyte, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of PbS-MAPI/TNTAs reached 5.98%, which was approximately 4.12 and 2.96 times of that of PbS/TNTAs and MAPI/TNTAs, respectively. This study provided a strategy to fabricate low-cost, high-efficiency Solar Cells with the use of PbS-MAPI heterostructures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An MgO/Au composite film with a 1.8 at% Zn-doped MgO surface layer prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering exhibited a superior electron-induced secondary electron emission (SEE) performance, and it had a SEE coefficient of 5.4 with an increase of 9.3% and a similar SEE degradation rate in comparison with an undoped composite film under primary electron bombardment of 200 eV. The mechanism for this SEE coefficient increase is tightly related to the reduced work function of Zn-doped MgO crystal analyzed by first-principles calculations and the enlarged MgO grains as well as the decreased surface roughness of Zn-doped MgO/Au film observed by morphological characterizations. In addition, for the Zn-doped MgO/Au film its improved electrical conductivity induced by Zn doping results in a similar SEE degradation rate even though it emits secondary electrons with the higher coefficient all the time under continuous electron bombardment compared with the undoped film.

AB The (TiZrNbHfTa)N/WN multicomponent coatings were deposited by vacuum arc evaporation under different substrate bias (-90 and -280 V). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used for analyzing of complex composition of investigated coatings by reflecting of atomic scale chemical interactions. The structural investigations showed the formation of a simple disordered solid solution in (TiZrNbHfTa)N layer, beta-W2N phase in WN layer with fcc crystal structure and highly disordered bcc (1 1 0) and (2 2 0) -oriented high-entropy alloy phases, regardless of the applied bias potential. It was shown that with increasing of substrate bias from -90 to -280 V, there is a slight decrease of hardness from 34 to 31 GPa and increase of Young's modulus from 325 to 337 GPa, which can be explained by annihilation of point defects and precipitation of relatively softer metallic phase.

The porous composite aerogel is characterized by scanning/transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The aerogel piece could be used directly as electrochemical sensor, different from the traditional modification of the glassy carbon electrode with the graphene. The aerogel electrode demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic performances in the detection of H2O2 with good repeatability, fast response and low detection limit.

AB The CdS layers are vital for diode quality of cell devices, which have great influences on high-performance CZTSSe solar cells. Optimizing the deposition processes of CdS layers are necessary to improve the diode quality and device efficiency. In this work, CZTSSe solar cells were fabricated without and with pre-deposited CdS layers, which are referred to as one-step and two-step processes, respectively. Then the performances of the CZTSSe solar cells were comparatively studied. Comparing with one-step processes, the efficiency of the solar cell by two-step processes improves from 7.24% to 9.45%. The efficiency improvement is mainly due to the gain of fill factor (FF) from 60.3% to 73.1%. Although the cell devices by different CdS processes have similar levels of interface recombination deduced from the activation energy (E-a), the temperature-dependent ideality factor A and shunt resistance (R-sh) indicate that the device fabricated by two-step possess higher diode quality and lower leakage current, which results in the increase of FF and efficiency. The optimization of CdS layer preparation is an effective approach to improve the efficiencies of solar cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Maternally-derived antibodies (MDA) provide early protection from disease, but may interfere with active immunity in young chicks. In highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV)-enzootic countries, broiler chickens typically have MDA to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and H5 HPAIV, and their impact on active immunity from recombinant vectored vaccines is unclear. We assessed the effectiveness of a spray-applied recombinant NDV vaccine with H5 AIV insert (rNDV-H5) and a recombinant turkey herpesvirus (HVT) vaccine with H5 AIV insert (rHVT-H5) in commercial broilers with MDA to NDV alone (MDA:AIV-NDV+) or to NDV plus AIV (MDA:AIV+NDV*) to provide protection against homologous HPAIV challenge. In Experiment 1, chicks were spray-vaccinated with rNDV-H5 at 3 weeks (3w) and challenged at 5 weeks (5w). All sham-vaccinated progeny lacked AIV antibodies and died following challenge. In rNDV-H5 vaccine groups, AIV and NDV MDA had completely declined to non-detectable levels by vaccination, enabling rNDV-H5 spray vaccine to elicit a protective AIV antibody response by 5w, with 70-78% survival and significant reduction of virus shedding compared to shams. In Experiment 2, progeny were vaccinated with rHVT-H5 and rNDV-H5 at 1 day (Id) or 3w and challenged at 5w. All sham vaccinated progeny lacked AIV antibodies and died following challenge. In rHVT-H5(1d) vaccine groups, irrespective of rNDV-H5(3w) boost, AIV antibodies reached protective levels pre-challenge, as all progeny survived and virus shedding significantly decreased compared to shams. In contrast, rNDV-H5-vaccinated progeny had AIV and/or NDV MDA at the time of vaccination (1d and/or 3w) and failed to develop a protective immune response by 5w, resulting in 100% mortality after challenge. Our results demonstrate that MDA to AIV had minimal impact on the effectiveness of rHVT-H5, but MDA to AIV and/or NDV at the time of vaccination can prevent development of protective immunity from a primary or booster rNDV-H5 vaccine.

AB Background: Based on immunogenicity studies, a 2 dose HPV vaccination-schedule was recently recommended for girls younger than 15 years. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccination against CIN2 or worse (CIN2+), by age at vaccination, number of doses, and to test whether optimal timing of 2 doses of qHPV vaccine can confer the same level of protection as the originally recommended three dose-schedule.
   Methods: A population-based cohort of all women aged 13-30 years, living in Denmark or Sweden during 2006-2013, was followed for qHPV vaccination status and first occurrence of CIN2+.
   Results: The study cohort comprised 2,253,561 women, of which 33% were vaccinated during follow-up, and 1.7% were diagnosed with CIN2+. Vaccination at ages 13-16 and 17-19 was associated with a reduced risk of CIN2+ after 3 doses (IRR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.11-0.49, and IRR = 0.65, 95% Cl 0.41-1.03, respectively), compared to being unvaccinated. After 1 and 2 doses there was a reduced risk, but not statistically significant. Women vaccinated ages 13-16 with 2 doses, where time between first and second dose was 5 months or longer showed no difference in risk compared to 3 doses.
   Conclusions: Women vaccinated with 3 doses of qHPV showed a reduced risk of CIN2+ if they were vaccinated before age 20, with a further reduced risk if vaccinated before age 17. Vaccination with 2 doses, with the second dose 5 months or longer after the first dose, did not yield an increased risk of CIN2+, compared to 3 doses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Better tools are necessary to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Modeling studies for regional Leishmania elimination indicate that an effective vaccine is a critical tool. Dogs are the reservoir host of L infantum in Brazil and the Mediterranean basin, and therefore are an important target for public health interventions as well as a relevant disease model for human VL. No vaccine has been efficacious as an immunotherapy to prevent progression of already diagnostically positive individuals to symptomatic leishmaniasis. We performed a double-blinded, block-randomized, placebo-controlled, vaccine immunotherapy trial testing the efficacy of a recombinant Leishmania A2 protein, saponin-adjuvanted, vaccine, LeishTec (R), in owned hunting dogs infected with L. infantum. The primary outcome was reduction of clinical progression, with reduction of mortality as a secondary outcome. Vaccination as an immunotherapy reduced the risk of progression to clinically overt leishmaniasis by 25% in asymptomatic dogs (RR: 1.33 95% C.I. 1.009-1.786 p-value: 0.0450). Receiving vaccine vs. placebo reduced all-cause mortality in younger asymptomatic dogs by 70% (RR: 3.19 95% C.I.: 1.185-8.502 p-value = 0.0245). Vaccination of infected-healthy animals with an anti-Leishmania vaccine significantly reduced clinical progression and decreased all-cause mortality. Use of vaccination in infected-healthy dogs can be a tool for Leishmania control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carnivore and omnivore animals are the main reservoir hosts of nematodes of the genus Trichinella. Out of the twelve taxa identified so far in the world, four, namely Trichinella spiralis, Trichinella nativa, Trichinella britovi and Trichinella pseudospiralis, are circulating in Europe. All these four species were detected in Finnish wild animals and T. spiralis also in domestic pigs and synanthropic rats of Finland up to 2004, when the last T. spiralis infection was documented in a domestic pig. In the periods 1993-1997 and 1999-2005, T. spiralis was detected in 13.6% (6/44) and in 14.5% (46/317) of infected wild animals, respectively. The aims of the present study were to investigate the prevalence of Trichinella spp., especially T. spiralis in wild carnivores of Finland, 7-9 years after the eradication of Trichinella infection from Finnish domestic pigs, and to evaluate the impact of the disappearance of domestic cycle of T. spiralis on the sylvatic Trichinella cycle(s). Trichinella spp. larvae were detected in 34.7% (1081/3112) wild animals and 835 (77.2%) Trichinella spp. isolates were identified at the species level. Trichinella spiralis was detected in 9 animals (1.0% of identified infections) as single, double or triple infections; whereas, T. spiralis had been detected in 13.6% and in 14.5% of infected wild animals in the course of the two previous investigations. The reduction of T. spiralis prevalence from 1993-1997 to 2011-2013 is statistically significant (p < 0.001) both per total tested animals and per host species. The results of this study support the hypothesis of spillover from domestic pigs as a source of T. spiralis in wildlife. The eradication of T. spiralis from the domestic cycle in Finland in 2004 has probably established a virtuous cycle reducing the prevalence of this pathogen among wild carnivores. We can expect that within some years and in absence of T. spiralis reintroduction in the domestic habitat, it might even disappear from the Finnish wildlife.

AB The present investigation was carried out with the objective to identify putative candidate genes / Quantitative trait loci for resistance / susceptibility towards Haemonchus infestation in tropical goat breed (Rohilkhandi goat) of India. The mean faecal egg count (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV) of the population were 142.78 +/- 22.54 epg (eggs per gram) and 31.73% +/- 0.49, respectively. Grouping of animals as per dot ELISA test showed 41.33% (n = 124) positive and 58.66% (n = 176) negative for Haemonchus infestation. The microsatellite loci DYA and ODRB1.2 were significantly associated (P <= 0.05) to parasite resistance. The locus DYA showed significant association with log FEC and dot ELISA and the locus ODRB1.2 showed significant association with log FEC, PCV and dot ELISA at P <= 0.05. Real time expression profiling revealed that the susceptible group (high EEC group) had 11.1-fold more expression of IFN gamma mRNA (Th-1 cytokine) and 0.11-fold lower expression of IL-10 mRNA (Th-2 cytokine), which was found to be statistically significant (P <= 0.05).

The study was conducted in ewes shortly after lambing during spring 2015. A FECR of less than 90%, indicating presence of AR against one or more nematode genera producing strongylid eggs, was found in 22 of 30 (73.3%) flocks against oxfendazole, 18 of 23 (78.3%) flocks against ivermectin, 15 of 32 (46.9%) flocks against moxidectin, and 2 of 26 (7.7%) flocks against monepantel. No AR was observed against levamisole. If oxfendazole resistance was observed, Haemonchus contortus was involved in 90.5% of the cases. If resistance against ivermectin, moxidectin or monepantel was observed, it invariably involved H. contortus. In the majority of cases resistance was also observed for Teladorsagia circumcincta and/or Trichostrongylus spp, between which no distinction was made in this study. Based on FECR 9 of 15 (60.0%) flocks showed resistance against closantel, which was mainly due to closantel not being effective against most other nematode species than H. contortus. However, in 44.4% of flocks showing reduced FECR it did involve H. contortus as well.
   Multi-drug resistance (excluding closantel) was found in 16 flocks, of which 8 showed resistance against 2 products, 7 against 3 products and 1 flock showed resistance against 4 products. If resistance against 3 or 4 products was present, there invariably was resistance against both ivermectin and moxidectin. Overall, of the 22 flocks in which both macrocyclic lactones (ML) were tested, 4 (18.2%) showed no resistance against both products, 9 (40.9%) showed resistance against ivermectin only, and 9 (40.9%) showed resistance against both MLs.
   It is concluded that AR is widespread in sheep in the Netherlands and involves products from all major anthelmintic classes, with possibly the exception of levamisole. It appears that the macrocyclic lactones have lost much of their efficacy against sheep nematodes over the last decade.

AB To find out the transmission routes for Toxocara infection, the possibility of transfer of Toxocara eggs from the soil on the paws of animals and on the shoes of people was explored. For this purpose, a study was conducted to find helminth eggs in washings from the paws of dogs after walking, from the shoes of their owners, as well as non-dog owners. Toxocara eggs were detected in 19.4% of the dogs' paws washings and in 11.4% of washings from the shoes of their owners. The number of eggs found on the paws was about twice as high as on the shoes. The mean number of eggs in the sample was 2.9 in washings from the paws and 1.8 from the shoes. In the samples, Toxocara cad eggs prevailed both in occurrence and in abundance. Out of the total number of positive samples, the eggs of T. cad were found in 83%, and T. canis in 42%. 79% of the found eggs belonged to T. cati and 21% to T. canis. In the washings from shoes of people that do not own dogs, the eggs of parasites were not found. This study demonstrates that the helminth eggs can be transferred from contaminated soil to people's homes on the paws and shoe soles. Even animals without a patent infection may take part in propagation of infection causing risks of human toxocariasis. In dogs, in addition, the transferred on paws T. canis eggs can serve as a causative agent of permanent, cumulative subclinical infection with a deferred manifestation in posterity. It is supposed that infestation "through the paws" is one of the probable routes of transmission of toxocariasis in dogs.

AB The poultry red mite (PRM), Dermanyssus gallinae, is a major pest of laying hens with extremely limited control means. To evaluate the potential of natural and commercial entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) for use against D. gallinae, we tested four wild populations of D. gallinae from Israeli farms. The genus Aspergillus was identified as the most abundant isolates from the mites. Additionally, eight new isolates of Metarhizium belonging to the specie M. brunneum were identified. At all sites from which mites were collected in both seasons, the abundance of fungi on D. gallinae was greater during the winter season than during the summer season. Through indirect inoculations of adult D. gallinae, we examined the virulence of the native Metarhizium species, the commercial strain Ma-43 and a previously described acaropathogenic strain (Ma-7). All of the Metarhizium strains caused 56-95% mortality of adult mites by seven days after inoculation at a concentration of 5 x 10(5) conidia per cm(2). The efficacies of Ma-43, Ma-7 and the most promising native strain were tested under optimal abiotic conditions (28 degrees C; 85-100% RH) and abiotic conditions similar to those typically found in a poultry house (30 degrees C; 60% RH). Under optimal conditions, the efficacy of all three stains ranged between 85 and 92%. In contrast, under poultry-house conditions, the efficacy of control ranged between 30 and 40%. The incidence of mycoses on mite cadavers was significantly decreased under poultry-house conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of native and commercial Metarhizium strains for use as biopesticides. Future research should address suitable delivery methods and formulations for the effective control of D. gallinae under poultry-house conditions.

ID CUNICULI INFECTION; PET RABBITS; DIAGNOSIS
AB Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a zoonotic and opportunistic pathogen, can cause latent infection, especially in lagomorphs. Nowadays, this member of the Eukaryotes has drawn significant attention in the fields of veterinary and public health. The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of infection in a New Zealand rabbit farm that has a clinical history of neurological manifestations including head tilt ataxia, aggressiveness, seizures, and circling and rotational movements around the body length axis, but the general conditions and food intake were normal. Blood samples were taken from 42 breeding rabbits and researched for E. cuniculi anti-bodies. Out of that, 25 (59%) animals resulted positive against the pathogen. The rabbit was found to be sero-positive for E. cuniculi antibodies, but negative for Toxoplasma gondii and Listeria monocytogenes antibodies. Hematological and serum biochemical parameters were measured at reference intervals. No brain tissue impairment was observed the computed tomography (CT) scan. As a result of these histopathological findings, the brain cortex presented severe neuronal degeneration and partial myelin loss, with reactive diffuse gliosis against the parasite spores was observed to the histopathology. These results are possibly related to the early stage of infection because the parasitic infestation comprise long time spreading. E. cuniculi DNA was detected on brain tissues using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and it partial DNA sequence was identified as E. cuniculi genotype I.

AB The aim of this review was to assess our current knowledge on phylogeography and global genetic structure of Echinococcus multilocularis populations originating from rodents, wild canid hosts, and human. Six bibliographic databases were searched from 1990 to 2017, identifying a total of 110 publications. The cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and cytochrome b (cytb) sequences of E. multilocularis from Asia, Europe, and North Americas were analyzed to estimate the diversity and neutrality indices, and genetic differentiation. A total of 69 (cox1, 36.7%) and 16 haplotypes (cytb, 19.2%) were grouped into various geographical clades. A parsimonious haplotype network demonstrated a star-like feature with haplo-groups Em2 (Asia: 36%), Em105 (Eastern Tibetan plateau: 4.8%), Em46 (Europe: 9.1%), Em73, (Europe: 2.7%) and Em92 (North Americas: 4.3%) as the most common haplotypes. A relatively high level of genetic diversity was detected in rodent-derived E. multilocularis isolates (Haplotype diversity: 0.944), wild canids (Hd: 0.912), and human origin (Hd: 0.704). The highest number of haplotypes (n = 59) and the highest haplotype diversity (0.969) were identified in the Asian and European populations, respectively. Cladistic phylogenetic tree indicated the European Glade has a sister relationship with the Asian Glade. However, some North American haplotypes were assigned to the European Glade together with haplotypes from Poland. The statistically significant Fst values indicated that E. multilocularis populations of Asian-European, Asian-North American, and European-North American origins were genetically differentiated (Fst: 0.22624 to 0.43059). An occurrence of distinct parasite populations suggests that E. multilocularis derived from glacial refugia have been plausibly sustained by indigenous hosts during the Pleistocene Epoch.

AB Angiostrongylus vasorum is a nematode parasite of the pulmonary arteries and heart that infects domestic and wild canids. Dogs (Canis familiaris) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are the most commonly affected definitive hosts. Recent studies suggest that angiostrongylosis is an emerging disease, and that red foxes may play an important role in the epidemiology of the parasite. Genetic analyses of parasites collected from dogs and foxes throughout Europe have shown that the same parasite haplotypes are commonly shared between different host species. However, the extent of genetic diversity within local A. vasorum populations and individual hosts is unknown. The objective of the present study was to assess the occurrence of genetic diversity among A. vasorum (a) recovered from different foxes within the Greater London area (a localised population, single worm per fox dataset); and (b) hosted within single foxes (multiple worms per fox dataset). During 2016, A. vasorum worms were collected from foxes culled for other purposes in London. DNA was extracted from each parasite and a partial fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (mtCOI) gene was amplified and sequenced. Sequences from the single worm dataset were compared with those published elsewhere. Combined, 19 haplotypes were described of which 15 were identified from foxes found in London, indicating that considerable genetic diversity can be detected within a local geographic area. Analysis of the multiple worm dataset identified 22 haplotypes defining worms recovered from just six foxes, emphasising the relevance of wild canines as reservoirs of genetic diversity. This is the first study to explore the genetic complexity of individual fox-hosted A. vasorum populations.

AB The studies were carried on raccoons from Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic. Tissue samples from raccoon hearts, lungs and brains were used for molecular examination while meat juice was collected for immunological tests.
   Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in six out of 44 raccoons (13.6%), while T. gondii DNA was found in 18 (40.9%). Antibodies against N. caninum were found in seven raccoons (15.9%) but no parasite DNA was observed in any sample.
   DNA of T. gondii was observed in raccoons of both sexes (in 42.3% of females and 38.9% of males) from all three countries. The proportion of raccoons that tested positive for DNA of T. gondii was higher in the Czech Republic (47.1%) than in Germany (33.3%), however the difference was non-significant (p = 0.7032).
   It seems that the raccoons appear to have been exposed to both T. gondii and N. caninum, but only T. gondii infection was confirmed. The role of raccoons as reservoir, and as possibly contributing to spread of these parasites merits further studies.

AB Intestinal schistosmosis caused by Schistosoma spindale and S. indicum is an important snail borne trematode infection that adversely affects the production and productivity of bovines in India. The present communication reports the high seroprevalence of infection among dairy cattle and buffaloes, under field conditions, utilizing a sensitive and specific excretory-secretory antigen based ELISA. Comparison of ELISA with copro-PCR, microscopy and post-mortem mesentery examination revealed the diagnostic superiority of ELISA. Seroprevalence of infection was mapped for the first time in India with special emphasis to agro-ecological zones. Anti-schistosome antibodies were detected in 34.96% of dairy cattle and buffaloes in the state with the evidence of significant influence of topography on the prevalence of infection. The study also highlighted the need to trace endemic pockets of infection in the country through efficient ante-mortem surveillance and to initiate anti-schistosome therapy prior to animal transport.

AB Species of Gasterophilus are obligate parasites of equids and may induce severe, even lethal myiasis. However, identification of the third instar Gasterophilus larva at the species level is still problematic predominantly due to a shortage of diagnostic morphological features and incomplete molecular libraries. Testing the suitability of three different molecular markers showed that the traditional 650 bp barcode region near the 5' terminus of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) served as a better tool for species-level identification than a 663 bp region near the 3' terminus of COI and a 554 bp region near the 5' terminus of the large subunit ribosomal RNA. We found that barcoding discriminates G. intestinalis, G. nasalis, G. nigricornis and G. pecorum but not G. haemor-rhoidalis and G. inermis. A comparative morphological study using scanning electron microscopy was conducted to promote the identification of the third instar larvae. Photographs of fresh mature third instar larvae are provided for all species, and the remarkable green body colour of third instar G. nigricornis is fully documented for the first time. Two morphological keys are provided, one is suitable for quick identification, and the other based on ultrastructural details is provided for further comparative morphological investigation. A new term 'oral plate' instead of 'mandible' was proposed for a pair of sclerites of uncertain homology emerging from the secondary mouth opening. Our data shows that DNA barcodes cannot replace morphology for identification of third instars of Gasterophilus species, and a scaffold is provided for an integrated taxonomic reference system, which will contribute to monitoring gasterophilosis for equid welfare and protection, and also facilitate further studies in functional anatomy, phylogenetic analyses and host-parasite co-evolutionary investigations of Gasterophilus.

AB Domesticated Old World camels (Camelus dromedarius and C. bactrianus) are important for the economy of several countries in Asia, Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula, and coccidiosis is important as a cause of mortality in juvenile camels. There is confusion concerning the species of coccidian parasites in camels and their life cycles. The objective of the present paper is to review biology of the Eimeria and Cystoisospora species in camels. The following conclusions were drawn. Although five species of Eimeria; E. cameli, E. rajasthani, E. dromedarii, E. bactriani, and E. pellerdyi were named from camels, only E. cameli, E. rajasthani, E. dromedarii have been consistently found in numerous surveys and they are morphologically distinct. We consider E. pellerdyi and E. bacterini as species enquirende/not valid. E. cameli oocysts are distinctive, dark brown and up to 108 mu m long. Its gametogonic stages and oocysts are present in the lamina propria of small intestines; only sexual stages have been confirmed. The remaining species of Eimeria (E. rajasthani and E. dromedarii) in camels are < 40 mu m long and their endogenous stages are unknown. There is one valid species of Cystoisospora, C. orlovi in camels and is associated with severe disease in young camels, both pastoral and stall fed camels. Camels as young as nine days old can develop severe diarrhea and can die before oocysts are detected in feces. Lesions and endogenous stages are confined to the large intestine. The main lesion is hemorrhagic, diphtheroid to hemorrhagic colitis-associated with sexual stages; asexual stages are unknown. Oocysts are rarely excreted by adult camels, and in low numbers. Therefore, infection in very young camels remains unexplained.

AB This paper presents oxidation of polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides (PCDPSs), dioxin-like compounds, by ferrate(VI) ((FeO42-)-O-VI, Fe(VI)). Kinetics of the reactions of Fe(VI) with seventeen PCDPSs, differ in number and positions of chlorine atoms (from 2 to 7), were investigated at pH 8.0. The second-order rate constants (k, M-1 s(-1)) of the reactions varied with the numbers and positions of chlorine atoms and appeared to be related with standard Gibbs free energy of formation (Delta(f)G(0)) of PCDPSs. Degradation experiments in the presence of ions and humic acid demonstrated complete removal of PeCDPS by Fe(VI) in minutes. Pathways of the reaction were investigated by identifying oxidized products (OPs) of the reaction between Fe(VI) and 2,2',3',4,5-pentachlorodiphenyl sulfide (PeCDPS) at pH 8.0. Pathways of oxidation involved major pathway of attack on sulfur(II) by Fe(Vl) in steps to yield sulfoxide type products, and subsequent breakage of C-S bond with the formation of sulfonic acid-containing trichloro compound. Minor pathways were hydroxylation of benzene ring and substitution of chlorine atom with hydroxyl group. Estimation of toxicity of OPs of the oxidation of PeCDPS by Fe(VI) suggested the decreased toxicity from the parent contaminant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria are well known for their aggregation ability. However, very little is known about cell surface physicochemical properties of anammox bacteria and thus their aggregation abilities have not been quantitatively evaluated yet. Here, we investigated the aggregation abilities of three different anammox bacterial species: "Candidatus Brocadia sinica", "Ca. Jettenia caeni" and "Ca. Brocadia sapporoensis". Planktonic free-living enrichment cultures of these three anammox species were harvested from the membrane bioreactors (MBRs). The physicochemical properties (e.g., contact angle, zeta potential, and surface thermodynamics) were analyzed for these anammox bacterial species and used in the extended DLVO theory to understand the force-distance relationship. In addition, their extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results revealed that the "Ca. B. sinica" cells have the most hydrophobic surface and less hydrophilic functional groups in EPS than other anammox strains, suggesting better aggregation capability. Furthermore, aggregate formation and anammox bacterial populations were monitored when planktonic free-living cells were cultured in up-flow column reactors under the same conditions. Rapid development of microbial aggregates was observed with the anammox bacterial population shifts to a dominance of "Ca. B. sinica" in all three reactors. The dominance of "Ca. B. sinica" could be explained by its better aggregation ability and the superior growth kinetic properties (higher growth rate and affinity to nitrite). The superior aggregation ability of "Ca. B. sinica" indicates significant advantages (efficient and rapid start-up of anammox reactors due to better biomass retention as granules and consequently stable performance) in wastewater treatment application.

AB Phosphorus recovery from industrialized poultry operations is necessary to ensure sustainable waste management and resource consumption. To realize these goals, an innovative, two-stage process chemistry has been developed to extract nutrients from poultry litter and recover value-added products. Over 75% phosphorus extraction was achieved by bubbling carbon dioxide into poultry litter slurries and adding strong acid to reach pH 4.5-5.5. After separating the nutrient-deficient poultry litter solids and the nutrient-rich liquid, the extract pH was increased through aeration and strong base addition. Over 95% of the extracted phosphorus was recovered as solid precipitate at pH 8.5-9.0. High-purity struvite and potassium struvite products were selectively recovered through pH control, introduction of a calcium-complexing agent, and addition of magnesium chloride. The nitrogen-to-phosphorus-to potassium (NPK) ratio of the recovered solids was controlled through aeration and pH adjustment. Precipitation at pH 8.5-9.0 and 10.5-11.0 resulted in NPK ratios of 2.0:1.0:0.1 and 0.9:1.0:0.2, respectively. The process effluent was effectively recycled as makeup water for the subsequent batch of poultry litter, thereby decreasing water consumption and increasing overall nutrient recovery. Sequencing batch operation yielded greater than 70% phosphorus recovery within a 45-min process, demonstrating the potential for this technology to alleviate nutrient pollution in agricultural settings and generate an alternative supply of phosphorus fertilizers.

AB Membrane technology has been widely employed for seawater desalination, water and wastewater reclamation, while membrane fouling still remains as a major challenge. The polysaccharides in extra cellular polymeric substances (EPS) have been recognized as an important foulant that causes serious membrane fouling, while the detailed structure of polysaccharides and the intermolecular interactions between them have not been adequately disclosed. In this study, two different polysaccharides and their mixtures were used to study the intermolecular cross-linking of polysaccharides as well as its effects on membrane fouling. Results demonstrated that the fouling propensities of distinct polysaccharides were completely different, which was attributed to the different intermolecular interactions lying in polysaccharides. The cross-linking among molecules of polysaccharide, regardless of the homogeneity, was found to form complex networks and determine the effective dimension of polysaccharides. Depending on the effective dimension of foulants, pore blocking and cake layer occurred subsequently during filtration processes. In light of this, it potentially gives new insights into the fouling behaviours by combining the structure-function knowledge of polysaccharides with their fouling propensity. In addition, transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) measurement was found to provide an intuitionistic evaluation of the complex networks formed from polysaccharides, so that may act as a good indicator of fouling during membrane filtration.

AB In this work, transformation of bisphenol A (BPA) alternatives bisphenol AF (BPAF) and bisphenol S (BPS) by manganese dioxide (MnO2) and the effect of iodide (I-) during these processes were investigated in comparison with BPA for the first time. These three bisphenols showed appreciable reactivity towards MnO2 with the half-lives of their loss following the order of BPA < BPAF < BPS under similar conditions, and a higher transformation efficiency was generally obtained at a lower pH. The presence of I- apparently accelerated the transformation of BPAF and BPS by MnO2 at pH < 7 but negligibly affected BPA transformation over the pH range of 5-9. This discrepancy could be well explained by the relative contribution of hypoiodous acid (HOI) in situ formed from I- oxidation by MnO2. Polymers, hydroxylated derivatives, and bond-cleavage products were detected from BPAF and BPS treated by MnO2, where a series of reactions of BPAF/BPS radicals formed from one-electron oxidation of BPAF/BPS were likely involved, similar to the case of BPA reported in literature. A group of iodinated aromatic products were additionally identified from BPAF/BPS treated by MnO2 in the presence of I- (e.g., iodinated BPAF/BPS and iodinated BPAF/BPS dimers), and they could be further transformed. This study suggests that naturally occurring manganese oxides play a significant role in the attenuation of bisphenols released into the environment and the presence of I- can display a great effect on their transformation.

AB Membrane biofouling, due to Soluble Microbial Products (SMP) and Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) deposition, results in reduction of the performance of Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs). However, recently, a new method of biofouling control has been developed, utilizing the interference of the bacterial inter- and intra-species' communication. Bacteria use Quorum Sensing (QS) to regulate the production of SMP and EPS. Therefore, disruption of Quorum Sensing (Quorum Quenching: QQ), by enzymes or microorganisms, may be a simple mean to control membrane biofouling. In the present study, a novel QQ-bacterium, namely Lactobacillus sp. SBR04MA, was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge and its ability to mitigate biofouling was evaluated by monitoring the changes in critical flux and transmembrane pressure, along with the production of EPS and SMP, in a lab scale MBR system treating synthetic wastewater. Lactobacillus sp. SBR04MA showed great potential for biofouling control, which was evidenced by the similar to 3-fold increase in critical flux (8.3 -> 24.25 L/m(2)/h), as well as by reduction of the SMP and EPS production, which was lower during the QQ-period when compared against the control period. Furthermore, the addition of the QQ-strain did not affect the COD removal rate. Results suggested that Lactobacillus sp. SBR04MA represents a novel and promising strain for biofouling mitigation and enhancement of MBRs performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid quantification of absolute microbial cell abundances is important for a comprehensive interpretation of microbiome surveys and crucial to support theoretical modelling and the design of engineered systems. In this paper, we propose a protocol specifically optimised for the quantification of microbial abundances in water biofilters using flow cytometry (FCM). We optimised cell detachment from sand biofilter particles for FCM quantification through the evaluation of five chemical dispersants (NaCI, Triton-X100, CaCl2, sodium pyrophosphate (PP), Tween 80 combined with PP), different mechanical pre treatments (low and high energy sonication and shaking) and two fixation methods (glutaraldehyde and ethanol). The developed protocol was cross-compared using other established and commonly employed methods for biomass quantification in water filter samples (adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and volatile solids (VS)). The highest microbial count was obtained by detaching the biofllm from biofilter grains and dispersing clusters into singles cells using Tween 80 and sodium pyrophosphate combined with four steps of high energy sonication (27W, for 80 s each step); glutaraldehyde was shown to be the best fixative solution. The developed protocol was reliable and highly reproducible and produced results that are comparable to data from alternative quantification methods. Indeed, high correlations were found with trends obtained through ATP and qPCR (rho = 0.98 and rho = 0,91) measurements. The VS content was confirmed as an inaccurate method to express biomass in sand samples since it correlated poorly with all the other three methods (rho = 0.005 with FCM, 0.002 with ATP and 0.177 with qPCR). FCM and ATP showed the strongest agreement between absolute counts with a slope of the correlation equal to 0.7, while qPCR seemed to overestimate cell counts by a factor of ten. The rapidity and reproducibility of the method developed make its application ideal for routine quantification of microbial cell abundances on sand from water biofilters and thus useful in revealing the ecological patterns and quantifying the metabolic kinetics involved in such systems.

AB Modification of polyamide reverse osmosis (RO) membranes with silver nanoparticles (AgNP) may effectively control biofouling. While silver leaching tests are usually performed during membrane development, the lack of common testing protocols limits cross-comparison among different labs. We compare four release tests to quantify the release of dissolved and nanoparticulate silver from polyamide RO membranes prepared through in situ surface functionalization: (1) batch immersion, (2) dead-end filtration, (3) cross-flow filtration, and (4) low-pressure water jetting. For the first time, we demonstrated the possibility of AgNP release to membrane-treated water through direct AgNP detachment. When using Nanopure water as an extraction solution, water jetting resulted in the fastest silver mass release, while dead-end filtration caused the slowest release based on the initial release kinetic data. Dead-end filtration exhibited silver mass release an order of magnitude lower than the other three tests. Although cross-flow filtration may best represent the RO membrane operation, quantifying silver release suffers from poor mass balance due to the adsorption of dissolved silver by various reactor components and large volumes of water usage. A commonly applied batch immersion method was low cost and easily performed, but may not induce hydraulic shear sufficient for AgNP detachment from a RO membrane. The information on silver release behavior may depend on the specific test, which is important for assessing antimicrobial efficacy and service life of the nanoparticle-functionalized membranes.

AB Enhanced removal of trace toxic metals (ppm level) from high-salinity wastewater is crucial to ensure water safety but still a challenging task. In this study, we fabricated a new hybrid ultrafiltration membrane (PAA/ZIF-8/PVDF) by immobilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) particles onto the surface of trimesoyl chloride (TMC)-modified polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane under protection of polyacrylic acid (PAA) layer. The resultant PAA/ZIF-8/PVDF membrane exhibited relatively high water flux of 460 L.m(-2)h(-1) and outstanding nickel ion (Ni(II)) capacity (219.09 mg/g) from a synthetic high-salinity ([Na+] = 15000 mg/L) wastewater. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies revealed that preferable Ni(II) uptake was mainly attributed to the specific interaction between Ni(II) and hydroxyl groups on ZIF-8 frameworks and carboxyl groups in PAA layer as well. Compared to PAA, ZIF-8 could selectively bind Ni(II) with negligible effect exerted by concentrated sodium ion. The filtration study showed that the 12.56-cm(2) membrane could effectively treat 5.76 L high-salinity wastewater ([Ni(II)(0) = 2 mg/L, [Na+](0) = 15000 mg/L) to conspicuously reduce Ni(II) below the maximum contaminant level of China, 0.1 mg/L. Moreover, the hybrid membrane could be regenerated by HCI-NaCl solution (pH = 5.5) for repeated use under direct current electric field. Generally speaking, the newly developed ZIF-8 hybrid ultrafiltration membrane showed a very promising potential in enhanced removal of toxic metals from high-salinity wastewater treatment.

AB This work aims to clarify the role of potential nitrite (NO2-) accumulation inside sludge flocs in N2O production by ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) at different dissolved oxygen (DO) levels with focus on the conditions of no significant bulk NO2- accumulation (<0.2 mg N/L). To this end, an augmented nitrifying sludge with much higher abundance of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) than AOB was enriched and then used for systematically designed batch tests, which targeted a range of DO levels from 0 to 3.0 mg O-2/L at a fixed ammonium concentration of 10 mg N/L. A two-pathway N2O model was applied to facilitate the interpretation of batch experimental data, thus shedding light on the relationships between N2O production pathways and key process parameters (i.e., DO and NO2- accumulation inside sludge flocs). The results demonstrated (i) the biomass specific N2O production rate firstly increased and then decreased with DO, with the maximum value of 3.03 +/- 0.05 mg N/h/g VSS obtained at DO level of 0.75 mg O-2/L, (ii) the AOB denitrification pathway for N2O production was dominant (98.0%) at all DO levels tested even without significant bulk NO2- accumulation (<0.2 mg N/L) observed in the system, but its contribution decreased with DO, (iii) DO had a positive impact on the hydroxylamine pathway for N2O production which therefore increased with DO, and (iv) the nitrite accumulation existed inside the sludge flocs and induced significant N2O production from the AOB denitrification pathway.

AB This study aimed to identify human specific metabolites of selected known or suspected endocrine disruptors (EDCs), mainly UV filters, used in personal care and consumer products whose metabolism has hardly been explored and to select suitable candidate biomarkers for human exposure studies using wastewater based epidemiology (WBE). The analysis of metabolic biomarkers of target chemicals is crucial in order to distinguish between internal and external exposure, since many sources contribute to chemicals being discharged into wastewater. This was achieved through the employment of a new analytical framework for verification of biomarkers of exposure to chemicals combining human bio-monitoring and water fingerprinting. Eight EDCs with unknown metabolic pathways (benzophenone-1 (BP-1); benzophenone-2 (BP-2); 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone (4,4'-DHBP); 4-benzylphenol (4-BenzPh); homosalate (HO); octocrylene (OC); 3-benzylidene camphor (3-BC), and two EDCs with known metabolism (bisphenol A (BPA) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3)) were tested. The biotransformation observed consisted mainly of phase I processes such as hydrolysis and hydroxylation together with phase II conjugation reactions such as sulphation and glucuronidation. Only two chemicals (BP-1, BP-3) were identified in urine and three chemicals (BPA, BP-1, BP-3) in wastewater. Five newly discovered metabolites (HO-Met1, OC-Met1, 4-BenzPh-Met4, 4-BenzPh-Met5 and 4-BenzPh-Met6) and one previously known metabolite (BPA-Met3) were detected in tested urine/wastewater samples from five WWTPs serving large communities ranging between 17 and 100 thousand inhabitants. The presence of metabolic biotransformation products of OC, 4-BenzPh, BPA and HO in wastewater provides evidence for internal exposure of studied populations to these chemicals.

AB Inhibition by ammoniacal nitrogen, consisting of free ammonia (NH3) and ammonium ion (NH4+), has been widely investigated for anaerobic digestion. However, despite the large amount of research on the subject, ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition still threatens many anaerobic digesters. This paper presents (i) a method to reliably characterise ammoniacal nitrogen inhibition and (ii) a robust inhibition modelling approach. Results showed that NH3 and NH4+ inhibition need to be jointly determined, which can only be done by performing inhibition tests at various total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) concentrations and pH values. These test conditions were reliably achieved using the salts NH4HCO3 and NH4Cl without pH adjustment, rather than by using NH4Cl with pH adjustment. The use of only salts showed a lower pH change during the inhibition test (similar to 1.5 days), thereby decreasing the uncertainty in TAN speciation and strengthening the test and model outputs. A threshold inhibition function satisfactorily described (R-2 > 0.99) the joint inhibition of NH3 and NH4+ on three distinct inocula, and provided a better description of the inhibition testing results than a non-competitive inhibition function (R-2 similar to 0.70). The key advantage of the proposed threshold inhibition function is its capacity to identify the inhibition lower limit (concentration where inhibition starts; KImin) and upper limit (concentration where inhibition is complete; KImax). The threshold inhibition function also identifies the 50% inhibition concentration (KI50) at the midpoint of KImin and KImax. Finally, experimental and model results show that at pH 7.3 - 7.7 and TAN concentrations above 2000 mgN.L-1, both NH3 and NH4+ contribute significantly to overall inhibition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The recharge of reclaimed water is an effective strategy for addressing the issues of water quality deterioration and groundwater level decline simultaneously. Residual Al coagulants are normally remained in the recovered water at low concentrations, and may induce clogging problems during the recharging process. However, this issue has been ignored in the past. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of Al(III)-induced aquifer bio-clogging, the role of Al(III) in quartz sand media (SiO2) dissolution and re-precipitation in the series of aquifer columns. We determined that Al(III) resulted in serious clogging in similar to 140 h at low concentrations that satisfied the national drinking water standard of China. The corresponding hydraulic conductivity decreased by more than similar to 90% in the bacteria-containing aquifer, which was similar to 30% greater than that for the bacteria-free trials. The enhanced Al(III)-related clogging was caused by modifying quartz sand to form Si-O-Al(OH)n and improving microbes attachment. Microbes retention kinetic coefficients (k) of the Al recharged simulated aquifer could increase by 3.0-8.3 times. The Al(III) also enhanced biomass production and clogging by binding to microbial extracellular polymeric substances. In turn, the greater amount of biomass accelerated the Si dissolution and re-precipitation, this may potentially damage the stability of aquifer structure. The results showed that reclaimed water treated with Al coagulation should be employed with caution for recharging. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The applicability of compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) for assessing in situ hydrolysis of parathion was investigated in a contaminated aquifer at a former pesticide wastes landfill site. Stable isotope analysis of parathion extracted from groundwater taken from different monitoring wells revealed a maximum enrichment in carbon isotope ratio of +4.9%0 compared to the source of parathion, providing evidence that in situ hydrolysis took place. Calculations based on the Rayleigh-equation approach indicated that the natural attenuation of parathion was up to 8.6% by hydrolysis under neutral and acidic conditions. In degradation experiments with aerobic and anaerobic parathion-degrading microbes, no carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation of parathion were observed. For the first time, CSIA has been applied for the exclusive assessment of the hydrolysis of phosphorothioate-containing organophosphorus pesticides at a contaminated field site.

AB In this work, we systematically investigated the persulfate (PS) activation potential of a series of nitrogen doped carbonaceous materials for the degradation of 2,4,4'-trihydroxybenzophenone (2,4,4'-HBP), an additive in polyvinyl acetate films and personal care products. Nitrogen originating from urea, NH4NO3, indole and polyaniline was doped into carbonaceous materials, including hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT-OH), large-inner thin-walled carboxylated carbon nanotubes (CNT-COOH) and graphite oxide (GO), to examine the catalytic effect. The NH4NO3-CNT-OH catalyst, which showed the best catalytic performance in 2,4,4'-HBP removal, was characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, Raman, BET surface area, XRD and XPS, and pyrrolic nitrogen was found to play a highly important role in the activation of PS. Under the conditions of [2,4,4'-HBP](0): [PS](0) = 1: 500, T = 25 degrees C, pH(0) = 7.0, concentration of catalyst = 100 mg L-1, 43.48 mu M 2,4,4'-HBP was completely removed in 2 h. According to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and radical quenching experiments, hydroxyl and sulfate radicals on the surface of the catalyst contributed to the substrate oxidation. Cleavage of C-C bridge bond, hydroxylation and polymerization were mainly involved in the oxidation process, leading to the formation of 10 intermediates (e.g., dimers), as detected by the MS/MS spectra. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the transformation mechanism of 2,4,4'-HBP in nitrogen doped carbonaceous materials catalyzed PS system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Raw water transportation pipelines are vital in an urban water supply system for transporting raw water to drinking water treatment plants. This study investigated the effects of pipe material on nitrogen transformation, microbial communities and characteristics of related function genes in paint-lined steel pipe (PLSP) and cement-lined steel pipe (CLSP) raw water model systems. We established quantitative relationships between specific functional genes and change rates of nitrogen pollutants, which were verified by field investigation on nitrogen pollutant transformations in real raw water transportation systems. The results showed that the CLSP produced higher ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) transformation rates and higher effluent concentrations of nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) than the PLSP. Both pipes achieved high and stable nitrite nitrogen (NO2--N) and low total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency. Nitrification was found to be the dominant process in both model systems, especially in the CLSP. Characteristics of microbial communities and nitrogen functional genes, which were analysed by high-throughput pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), respectively, varied between the two pipe systems. Nitrogen transformation pathways, identified by path analysis, were also different between the PLSP and CLSP due to different microbial community characteristics and synergistic effects of nitrogen functional genes. In the CLSP, (NH4+-N -> NO2--N) with part denitrification, was the primary transformation pathway of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), while only ammonia oxidization contributed to NH4+-N transformation in the PLSP. (NO2--N--> NO3--N) was the main pathway involved in NO2--N transformation and NO3--N accumulation. The TN removal showed complex relationships with nitrification, denitrification and nitrogen fixation processes. These findings provided molecular-level insights into nitrogen pollutant transformations during the transportation of raw water through different types of pipes and technical support for the selection of raw water pipe materials. In our study area, the Taihu basin, China, PLSP was better than CLSP for distributing raw water in a short transportation distance, due to the lower effluent concentrations of DON and NO3--N and less abundance of microorganisms.

AB In this work, we examine the factors predicting the perception of three distinct risks, namely "Algae growth", "Chemical pollution" and "Changes to ecosystems", to the water environment of each European Union Member State. We utilize a novel dataset that combines a Europe-wide Eurobarometer poll on water-related issues and a database of water quality indicators, water stressors and impacts compiled for the European Environment Agency (EEA) under the Water Information System for Europe (WISE). We utilize a three-level logistic regression model with the 2nd and 3rd levels being the region and the country in which the respondent lives. We find that perceived risks generally reflect the actual state of the environment at both the regional and national level, with the national level being stronger. Perceived risks are also related to socio-demographics, information and knowledge, pro-environmental activity and consumer practices. The influence of unobserved factors, captured in the model by random effects, was large at the national level, reflecting differences in cultural and institutional structures". Results support higher levels of water policy devolution and more focused and targeted policy communication. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adding conductive materials can promote methanogenesis via facilitating electron exchange between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea. However, little is known about how temperature would interact with such an addition and thus affect the compositions and characteristics of endogenous redox mediators (ERMs). In particular, it is of strong interest to understand how the temperature variation would affect the improvement on methanogenesis induced by ERMs with conductive materials. Herein, we have investigated the response of sludge methanogenesis to temperature variation (from 15 to 35 degrees C) and spectroscopically detected the ERMs induced by conductive red mud. It was demonstrated that the increasing temperature enhanced the stimulating effect of conductive red mud on methane accumulation, and the methane production potential showed a linear relationship with redox parameters such as areal capacitance (Ca), free charges (R-2) and electron exchange capacity (EEC). 2DCOS spectra further indicated that v(C-O) and delta(O-H) in humic acids, beta-turn type III amide I nu(s)(C=O) in Cytochrome c, and delta(C-H) in amines and lipids became the main redox groups in ERMs at 35 degrees C with the addition of red mud. The model revealed that the contribution of ERMs to the CO2 reduction to CH4 increased from 35.2 1.4% to 58.6 1.5% when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 degrees degrees C. Our finding that conductive materials stimulated the formation and electroactivity of ERMs with the increasing temperature during anaerobic digestion can have important implications for the improvement of engineered methanogenic processes.

AB The residual dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nitrate in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent have potential negative impacts on the aqueous environment. To that end, we used formic acid (FA) to enhance the photochemical behavior of the photocatalytic membrane for the simultaneous removal of DOM and nitrate from secondary STP effluent. Effluent samples were collected from two different biological treatment processes, Anaerobic-Oxic and Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic-membrane bioreactor, respectively. Through Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) analysis, we found that the addition of FA resulted in a similar molecular transformation in different STP effluent samples. Besides, the radical signal of the carboxyl anion could be observed during the photocatalytic process. Based on the results, we proposed the mechanism of the process that carboxyl anion radicals generated by FA could attack DOM and result in further oxidation of the DOM transition state to CO2 or small molecule by nitrate. Meanwhile, CHON and CHOS compounds in DOM were attacked by the carboxyl anion radicals more easily than CHO compounds. Moreover, long-term use of the membrane confirmed its durability and reusability in practical applications. At a moderate FA concentration and lower hydraulic retention time, the nitrate and DOM removal efficiencies for the sample from JX STP were 68% and 70%, respectively, whereas those of the CD STP sample were 85% and 60%. The removal of DOM and nitrate from different Si? effluents using photocatalytic membranes is an advanced approach for the treatment of secondary effluent, and may be applicable to other membranes or systems.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) is a new type of nanomaterial with unique physicochemical properties and diverse applications, whereas it poses potential risk to human and environment. By screening from natural soil exposed to GO in the laboratory, we successfully obtained a novel bacterium, Labrys sp. WJW, which was able to use GO as the sole carbon source for growth. Within 8 days, cell numbers increased 16.76 +/- 3.21 folds using 100 mg/L GO as the carbon source by qPCR analysis. The bacterial biodegradation which resulted in formation of holes and functional group changes of GO was proved by Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. Aromatic intermediates with structures of benzoic acid and phenol were identified using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/time-of-flight/mass spectrometry. Combination of genomic and proteomic analyses were performed to explore the proteins associated with GO degradation. A total of 644 proteins were significantly shifted. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that part of the up-regulated proteins were related to oxidation, ring cleavage and intermediates trans membrane processes, and GO was supposed to be degraded to benzoate and further degraded for downstream processes. This study enriches our understanding and provides new insights into the environmental fate of GO. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Inter-basin Water Transfers (IBWT) are recognized as one of the major pathways of freshwater invasion. They provide a direct link between previously isolated catchments and may modify the habitat conditions of the receiving waters such that they become more favourable for the establishment of invasive species. Combined, IBWT and invasive species will intensify the stress upon native species and ecosystems. Using the Severn and Thames Rivers two of the largest river systems in Great Britain as a case study, here we assess the potential influence of IBWT on the expansion of invasive species and thus their impact on biodiversity conservation. The Thames Valley is subject to extensive water abstraction, and an increasing population means that supplemented flow from the River Severn is being considered. Multi scale Suitability Models, based on climate and water chemistry respectively, provided novel evidence that there is serious risk for further spread of invasive species in the focus area, particularly of the quagga mussel, a recent invader of the Thames River. Native freshwater mussels are particularly vulnerable to changing environmental conditions, and may suffer the decrease in alkalinity and increase in sedimentation associated with an IBWT from the lower Severn to the upper Thames. Regional models suggest considerable overlap between the areas suitable for three vulnerable native freshwater mussels and the expansion of invasive species that negatively impact upon the native mussels. This study illustrates the use of novel spatially-explicit techniques to help managers make informed decisions about the risks associated with introducing aquatic invasive species under different engineering scenarios. Such information may be especially important under new legislation (e.g. EU Invasive Species Regulation No 1143/2014) which increases the responsibility of water managers to contain and not transfer invasive species into new locations.

AB The biological potential of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove micropollutants mainly depends on process conditions and the predominant microbial community. To explore this dependence and to connect the occurrence of genera with operating conditions, five pilot-scale reactors with different process conditions were combined into two reactor cascades and fed with the effluent of the primary clarifier of a municipal WWTP. All reactors and the WWTP were analyzed for the removal of 33 micropollutants by LC-MS/MS and the presence of the microbial community using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The overall removal of the micropollutants was slightly improved (ca. 20%) by the reactor cascades in comparison to the WWTP while certain compounds such as diatrizoate, venlafaxine or diclofenac showed an enhanced removal (ca. 70% in one or both cascades). To explore the diverse bacteria in more detail, the general community was divided into a core and a specialized community. Despite their profoundly different operating parameters (especially redox conditions), the different treatments share a core community consisted of 143 genera (9% of the overall community). Furthermore, the alpha- and beta-biodiversity as well as the occurrence of several genera belonging to the specialized microbial community could be linked to the prevalent process conditions of the individual treatments. Members of the specialized community also correlated with the removal of certain groups of micro pollutants. Hence, the comparison of the specialized community with micropollutant removal and operating conditions via correlation analysis is a valuable tool for an extended evaluation of prevalent process conditions. Based on an extended data set this approach could also be used to identify organisms as indicators for operating conditions which are beneficial for an improved removal of specific micropollutants.

AB The effective removal of haloacetamides (HAMS) as a group of emerging disinfection by-products is essential for drinking water safety. This study investigated the degradation of 10 HAMs, including chlorinated, brominated, and iodinated analogues, by sodium sulfite (S(IV)) and the mechanism behind it. The results indicated that all HAMs, excluding chlorinated HAMS, decomposed immediately when exposed to S(IV). The reductive dehalogenation kinetics were well described by a second-order kinetics model, first-order in S(IV) and first-order in HAMs. The degradation rates of HAMs increased with the increase of pH and they were positively correlated with sulfite concentration, indicating that the reaction of S(IV) with HAMs mainly depends on sulfite. The rank order and relative activity of the reaction of sulfite with HAMs depends on bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction reactivity. The order of the reductive dehalogenation rates of HAMS versus the substitution of halogen atoms was iodo- > bromo- > > chloro-. During reductive dehalogenation of HAMs by sulfite, the alpha-carbon bound to the amide group underwent nucleophilic attack at 180 degrees to the leaving group (halide). As a consequence, the halide was pushed off the opposite side, generating a transition state pentacoordinate. The breaking of the C-X bond and the formation of the new C-S bond occurred simultaneously and HAM sulfonate formed as the immediate product. Results suggest that S(IV) can be used to degrade brominated and iodinated HAMs in drinking water and therefore should not be added as a quenching agent before HAM analysis to accurately determine the HAM concentrations produced during water disinfection.

AB The emergence of antibiotic resistance represents a major threat to human health. In this work we investigated the elimination of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) by solar light and solar photo-Fenton processes. As such, we have designed an experimental plan in which several bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) possessing different drug-susceptible and -resistant patterns and structures (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) were subjected to solar light and the photo-Fenton oxidative treatment in water. We showed that both solar light and solar photo-Fenton processes were effective in the elimination of ARB in water and that the time necessary for solar light disinfection and solar photo-Fenton disinfection were similar for antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant strains (mostly 180-240 and 90-120 min, respectively). Moreover, the bacterial structure did not significantly affect the effectiveness of the treatment. Similar regrowth pattern was observed (compared to the susceptible strain) and no development of bacteria with higher drug-resistance values was found in waters after any treatment. Finally, both processes were effective to reduce AR genes (ARGs), although solar photo-Fenton was more rapid than solar light. In conclusion, the solar photo-Fenton process ensured effective disinfection of ARB and elimination of ARGs in water (or wastewater) and is a potential mean to ensure limitation of ARB and ARG spread in nature.

AB Compared to autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification process, the Integrated autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification (IAHD) has wider foreground of applications in the condition where the organic carbon, nitrate and inorganic sulfur compounds usually co-exist in the actual wastewaters. As the most well-known IAHD process, the denitrifying sulfide removal (DSR) could simultaneously convert sulfide, nitrate and organic carbon into sulfur, dinitrogen gas and carbon dioxide, respectively. Thus, systematical metabolic functions and contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers to the IAHD-DSR performance became an problem demanding to be promptly studied. In this work, three upfiow anaerobic sludge bioreactors (UASBs) were individually started up in autotrophic (a-DSR), heterotrophic (h-DSR) and mixotrophic conditions (m-DSR). Then, the operating conditions of each biore-actor were switched to different trophic conditions with low and high sulfide concentrations in the influent (200 and 400 mg/L). The removal efficiencies of sulfide, nitrate and acetate all reached 100% in all three bioreactors throughout the operational stages. However, the sulfur transformation ratio ranged from 34.5% to 39.9% at the low sulfide concentration and from 76.8% to 86.7% at the high sulfide concentration in the mixotrophic conditions. Microbial community structure analyzed by the Illumina sequencing indicated that Thiobacillus, which are autotrophic sulfide-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing bacteria (a-soNRB), was the dominant genus (81.3%) in the a-DSR bioreactor. With respect to the mixotrophic conditions, at low sulfide concentration in the m-DSR bioreactor, Thiobacillus (a-soNRB) and Thauera, which are heterotrophic nitrate-reducing bacteria (hNRB), were the dominant genera, with percentages of 48.8% and 14.9%, respectively. When the sulfide concentration in the influent was doubled, the percentage of Thiobacillus decreased by approximately 9-fold (from 48.8% to 5.4%), and the total percentage of Azoarcus and Pseudomonas, which are heterotrophic sulfide-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing bacteria (h-soNRB), increased by approximately 6-fold (from 10.1% to 59.4%). Therefore, the following interactions between functional groups and their functional mechanisms in the DSR process were proposed: (1) a-soNRB (Thiobacillus) and hNRB (Thauera) worked together to maintain the performance under the low sulfide concentration; (2) h-soNRB (Azoarcus and Pseudomonas) took the place of a-soNRB and worked together with hNRB (Thauera and Allidiomarina) under the high sulfide concentration; and (3) a-soNRB (such as Thiobacillus) were possibly the key bacteria and may have contributed to the low sulfur transformation, and h-soNRB may be responsible for the high sulfur transformation in the DSR process.

TI Energy consumption in capacitive deionization - Constant current versus
   constant voltage operation
SO WATER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Capacitive deionization; Constant current and constant voltage
   operation; Optimizing salt adsorption; Minimizing energy consumption
ID WATER DESALINATION; ELECTRODES; RECOVERY; ADSORPTION
AB In the field of Capacitive Deionization (CDI), it has become a common notion that constant current (CC) operation consumes significantly less energy than constant voltage operation (CV). Arguments in support of this claim are that in CC operation the endpoint voltage is reached only at the end of the charging step, and thus the average cell voltage during charging is lower than the endpoint voltage, and that in CC operation we can recover part of the invested energy during discharge. Though these arguments are correct, in the present work based on experiments and theory, we conclude that in operation of a well-defined CDI cycle, this does not lead, for the case we analyze, to the general conclusion that CC operation is more energy efficient. Instead, we find that without energy recovery there is no difference in energy consumption between CC and CV operation. Including 50% energy recovery, we find that indeed CC is more energy efficient, but also in CV much energy can be recovered. Important in the analysis is to precisely define the desalination objective function, such as that per unit total operational time including both the charge and discharge steps a certain desalination quantity and water recovery must be achieved. Another point is that also in CV operation energy recovery is possible by discharge at a non-zero cell voltage. To aid the analysis we present a new method of data representation where energy consumption is plotted against desalination. In addition, we propose that one must analyze the full range of combinations of cycle times, voltages and currents, and only compare the best cycles, to be able to conclude which operational mode is optimal for a given desalination objective. We discuss three methods to make this analysis in a rigorous way, two experimental and one combining experiments and theory. We use the last method and present results of this analysis.

AB The low yield of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) biomass has attracted great attention because of its difficulty to be abundantly enriched. Patterns of substrate supply greatly influence microbial metabolism and behavior. The present study proposed that low nitrogen strength was beneficial to anammox biomass yield and nitrogen removal when comparing a membrane bioreactor (MBR) operated at low nitrogen strength with short hydraulic retention time (HRT) (R-low; influent: fixed at 100 mg-N L-1) and one operated at high nitrogen strength with long HRT (R-stepwise; influent: 100-700 mg-N L-1). Different nitrite concentrations in the two MBRs would indicate discrepant environments, and inevitably resulted in the discrepant microbial responses for anammox community. In particular, we found that at low nitrogen strength, increased activities of purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways provided more abundant nucleic acids for bacterial proliferation. More active reaction of lipid and protein synthesis favored the synthesis of cellular structure. Importantly, the metabolism of cheaper amino acids was more active under low nitrogen strength, which was coupled with higher metabolic flux and potentially more active exchange of costly amino acids as public goods. In this way, more energy could be saved and applied to biomass yield. Higher active bacterial diversity and more positive interactions among bacterial species in R-low further favored biomass yield and nitrogen removal. The present study highlighted the significant effect of substrate supply patterns on anammox, which is meaningful to overcome the current bottleneck of deficient anammox biomass for application in wastewater treatment.

AB Sulfide prevails in both industrial and municipal waste streams and is one of the most troublesome issues with waste handling. Various technologies and strategies have been developed and used to deal with sulfide for decades, among which biological means make up a considerable portion due to their low operation requirements and flexibility. Sulfur bacteria play a vital role in these biotechnologies. In this article, conventional biological approaches dealing with sulfide and functional microorganisms are systematically reviewed. Linking the sulfur cycle with other nutrient cycles such as nitrogen or phosphorous, and with continued focus of waste remediation by sulfur bacteria, has led to emerging biotechnologies. Furthermore, opportunities for energy harvest and resource recovery based on sulfur bacteria are also discussed. The electroactivity of sulfur bacteria indicates a broad perspective of sulfur based bioelectrochemical systems in terms of bioelectricity production and bioelectrochemical synthesis. The considerable PHA accumulation, high yield and anoxygenic growth conditions in certain phototrophic sulfur bacteria could provide an interesting alternative for bioplastic production. In this review, new merits of biological sulfide oxidation from a traditional environmental management perspective as well as a waste to resource perspective are presented along with their potential applications.

AB The overwhelming majority of research conducted to date on plastic pollution (all size fractions) has focused on marine ecosystems. In comparison, only a few studies provide evidence for the presence of plastic debris in freshwater environments. However, owing to the numerous differences between freshwater studies (including studied species and habitats, geographical locations, social and economic contexts, the type of data obtained and also the broad range of purposes), they show only fragments of the overall picture of freshwater plastic pollution. This highlights the lack of a holistic vision and evidences several knowledge gaps and data biases. Through a bibliometric analysis we identified such knowledge gaps, inconsistencies and survey trends of plastic pollution research within freshwater ecosystems.
   We conclude that there is a continued need to increase the field-data bases about plastics (all size fractions) in freshwater environments. This is particularly important to estimate river plastic emissions to the world's oceans. Accordingly, data about macroplastics from most polluted and larger rivers are very scarce, although macroplastics represent a huge input in terms of plastics weight. In addition, submerged macroplastics may play an important role in transporting mismanaged plastic waste, however almost no studies exist. Although many of the most plastic polluted rivers are in Asia, only 14% of the reviewed studies were carried out in this continent (even though the major inland fisheries of the world are located in Asia's rivers). The potential damage caused by macroplastics on a wide range of freshwater fauna is as yet undetermined, even though negative impacts have been well documented in similar marine species. We also noted a clear supremacy of microplastic studies over macroplastic ones, even though there is no reason to assume that freshwater ecosystems remain unaffected by macro-debris.
   Finally, we recommend focusing monitoring efforts in most polluted rivers worldwide, but particularly in countries with rapid economic development and poor waste management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of proteins on bacterial transport and deposition behaviors in quartz sand was examined in both NaCl (10 and 25 mM) and CaCl2 solutions (1.2 and 5 mM). Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and bovine trypsin were used to represent negatively and positively charged proteins in natural aquatic systems, respectively. The presence of negatively charged BSA in suspensions increased the transport and decreased bacterial deposition in quartz sand, regardless of the ionic strength and ion types. Whereas, positively charged trypsin inhibited the transport and enhanced bacterial deposition under all experimental conditions. The potential mechanisms controlling the changes of bacterial transport behaviors varied for different charged proteins. The steric repulsion resulting from BSA adsorption onto both bacteria and quartz sand was found to play a dominant role in the transport and deposition of bacteria in porous media with BSA copresent in suspension. BSA adsorption onto bacterial surfaces and competition for deposition sites onto sand surfaces (adsorption of quartz sand surfaces) contributed to the increased cell transport with BSA in suspension. In contrast, the attractive patch-charged interaction induced by the adsorption of trypsin onto both bacteria and quartz sand had great contribution to the decreased bacterial transport in porous media with trypsin copresent in suspension. The increase in bacteria size, and the adsorption of trypsin onto cell surfaces (resulting in less negative cell surface charge) and quartz sand surfaces (providing extra deposition sites) were found to be the main contributors to the decreased transport and increased deposition of bacteria in quartz sand with trypsin in suspension.

AB Humification plays an important role in the sewage sludge stabilization treatment and probably influences the end-product ecotoxicity, which are not fully understood for high-solid anaerobic digestion (AD) process. This study monitored the aromaticity degree of humic acid-like fraction (HA) and detected digestate phytotoxicity during a 48-d high-solid AD. Significant repolymerization of aromatic structures in HA. Electrical conductivity (EC) of digestate changed negatively with the aromaticity degree in HA, and the digestate with high EC had low seed germination index (SGI). A positive correlation between SGI and the aromaticity degree of HA was found. Aromatic repolymerization of HA supplies more aromatic electron-rich sites to form neo-humic polymers and to determine the distribution of organic and/or inorganic phytotoxic compounds; thus, aromatic repolymerization of HA may control the digestate phytotoxicity by reducing excessive salinity. The results showed the effect of HA repolymerization on digestate stabilization and phytotoxicity reduction during the high-solid AD process. The inadequate phytotoxicity reduction efficiency (SGI <= 17%) may be ascribed to unaccomplished HA repolymerization, creating a demand for humification intensification studies.

AB The secondary sedimentation tank (SST) is a sensitive and complicated process in an activated sludge process. Due to the importance of its performance, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods have been employed to study the underflow hydrodynamics and solids distribution. Unlike most of the previous numerical studies, in the present investigation, the performance of three different types of turbulence models, standard k-epsilon, RNG k-epsilon and Realizable k-epsilon, are evaluated. Firstly, two-dimensional axisymmetric CFD models of two circular SSTs are validated with the field observations. Next, comprehensive comparisons are presented of the model predictions of the key physical quantities, such as the concentration of effluent suspended solids (ESS), and returned activated sludge (RAS), sludge blanket height (SBH), turbulent properties and flow and concentration patterns.
   A surprising result shows that the prediction of the ESS concentration is not sensitive to the change of turbulence models; while remarkable prediction difference can be observed in the inlet zone and near field of sludge hopper and SBH. The results suggest that more observations inside the inlet zone are needed to achieve better model calibration and correct application of the turbulence model, which can be crucial to optimizing the geometry of inlet structure and sludge hopper as well as changing return solids concentration for the operation.

AB Limited concentrations of oxygen in constructed wetlands (CWs) have inhibited their ability to remove emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) at a or ng/L levels. Manganese (Mn) oxides were proposed as a solution, as they are powerful oxidants with strong adsorptive capabilities. In the present study, triclosan (TCS) was selected as a typical EOC, and CW microcosms with Mn oxides (birnessite) coated sand (BCWs) and without (C-CWs) were developed to test the removal capacities of TCS and common nutrients. We found that the addition of Mn oxides coated sand significantly improved removal efficiencies of TCS, NH4-N, COD, NO3-N and TP (P < 0.05). The average concentration of Mn(II) effluent was 0.036 mg L-1, mostly lower than the drinking water limit. To gain insight into the mechanisms of pollution removal, Mn transformation, dissolved oxygen (DO) distribution, bacterial abundance, and microbial community composition were also investigated. Maximum Mn(II) was detected at 20 cm height of the B-CWs in anoxic zone. Although Mn-oxidizing bacteria existed in the layer of 30-50 cm with 10(3)-10(4) CFU g(-1) dry substate, Mn oxides were only detected at height from 40 to 50 cm with rich oxygen in B-CW. The quantities of bacterial 16S rRNA, amoA, narG and nosZ were not significantly different between two systems (P > 0.05), while Illumina high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the abundance of denitrifying bacteria was significant higher in B-CWs, and the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria that have a recognized role in Mn transformation were significantly increased. The results indicated that Mn oxides could enhance TCS and common pollutants removal in both anoxic and aerobic areas through the recycling of Mn between Mn(II) and biogenic Mn oxides.

AB This work is to evaluate pilot-scale Revolving Algal Biofilm (RAB) reactors of two heights (0.9-m and 1.8-m tall) to treat supernatant from sludge sedimentation at Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) for removing nutrients (N and P) as well as various metals. The RAB reactors demonstrated a superior performance in N and P removal as compared to control raceway ponds. Taller 1.8-m RAB reactors performed better than 0.9-m RAB reactors in terms of total nutrient removal and algal biomass productivity. At 7-day HRT, total P (TP) and Total Kjeldahl N (TKN) removal efficiency reached to 80% and 87%, respectively, while ortho-P and ammonia removal efficiency reached to 100%. Decreasing HRT led to an enhanced TP and TKN removal rate and nutrient removal capacity. At HRT of 1.3-day, the TP removal per footprint of 1.8-m tall RAB reactors was around 7-times higher than the open pond system. The RAB reactors also showed certain capabilities of removing metals from wastewater. The study demonstrated that RAB-based treatment process is an effective method to recover nutrients from municipal wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Internal Circulation (IC) anaerobic systems are especially suitable when plant designs that involve both small footprints and high organic loading rates (>25 kg COD m(-3) d(-1)) are required. However, given that operating anaerobic processes at high organic loads increases their vulnerability to external disturbances, real-time indicators of the stability conditions become particularly pertinent for IC reactors. This paper addresses the design and full-scale validation of a software sensor that uses only feeding flow-rate and biogas flow-rate measurements to classify the operating conditions of the reactor as "strongly", "moderately" or "weakly" stable. A simulation-based procedure was used to design the software sensor and configure its parameters. Then, the performance of the software sensor was tested under real conditions in a full-scale IC reactor of 1679 m(3) installed in a recycled paper mill (RPM). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Oxidation experiments (chlorine, ozone and bromine) were carried out with synthetic saline waters containing natural organic matter (NOM) extracts and model compounds to evaluate the potential of these surrogates to mimic the formation of brominated trihalomethanes (Br-THMs) in natural saline waters. Synthetic saline water with Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA) showed comparable results to natural brackish and sea water for Br-THMs formation during chlorination and ozonation for typical ballast water treatment conditions ([Cl-2](0) >= 5 mg/L or [O-3](0) >= 3 mg/L). The molar CHBr3 yield in synthetic saline waters is higher for chlorination than for ozonation, since ozone reacts slower with bromide and faster with THM precursors. For bromination, the molar yields of CHBr3 for the NOM model compounds phenol, resorcinol, 3-oxopentanedioic acid and hydroquinone are 28, 62, 91 and 11%, respectively. CHBr3 formation is low during chlorination or ozonation of resorcinol-containing synthetic saline waters due to the faster reaction of resorcinol with these oxidants compared to the bromine formation from bromide. Oxidation experiments with mixtures of hydroquinone and phenol (or resorcinol) were conducted to mimic various functional groups of NOM reacting with Cl-2 (or O-3) in saline water. With increasing hydroquinone concentrations, the CHBr3 formation increases during both chlorination and ozonation of the mixtures, except for chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol. The formation of THMs during chlorination of the mixture of hydroquinone and resorcinol is similar to that of resorcinol alone due to the much faster reaction of HOX with resorcinol compared to hydroquinone. In general, PLFA seems to be a reasonable DOM surrogate to simulate CHBr3 formation for realistic ballast water treatment. During chlorination, CHBr3 formations from phenol- and PLFA-containing synthetic brackish waters are comparable, for similar phenol contents. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive review was carried out on the influence of mixing on anaerobic digestion (AD) efficiency in stirred tank anaerobic digesters. Though traditionally, stirred tank digesters operated as continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), this review revealed that there is no motivation to continue to operate stirred tank anaerobic digesters as CSTRs if AD energy efficiency is to be improved. AD energy production efficiency can be achieved with optimized intermittent mixing. AD efficiency should include an assessment of the net energy production efficiency and should be the criteria in determining the mixing mode, mixing intensity, mixing time and mixing interval for every anaerobic digestion operating plan.

AB A series of one-dimensional column experiments were conducted to investigate the transport and retention of micron-sized plastic spheres (MPs) with diameters of 0.1-2.0 mu m in seawater-saturated sand. In seawater with salinity of 35 PSU (practical salinity units), the mass percentages recovered from the effluent (M-eff) of the larger MPs increased from 13.6% to 41.3%, as MP size decreased from 2.0 mu m to 0.8 mu m. This occurred because of the gradual reduction of physical straining effect of MPs in the pores between sands. The smaller MPs (0.6, 0.4, and 0.1 mu m) showed the stronger inhibition of MPs mobility, with M-eff values of 11.5%, 11.9%, and 9.8%, respectively. This was due to the lower energy barriers (from 108 k(B)T to 16 k(B)T) between the smaller MPs and the sand surface, when compared with the larger MPs (from 296 k(B)T to 161 k(B)T). In particular, the aggregation of MPs (0.6 or 0.4 mu m) triggered a progressive decrease in MP concentration in the effluent. Retention experiments showed that the vertical migration distance of most MP colloids was 0-4 cm at the inlet of column. For 0.6 or 0.4 mu m MPs, the particles were concentrated over a 0-2 cm vertical distance. Moreover, the salinity (35-3.5 PSU) did not affect the transport of the larger MPs (2.0-0.8 mu m). However, as seawater salinity decreased from 35 PSU to 17.5 or 3.5 PSU, the aggregation of the smaller MPs (0.6-0.1 mu m) was dramatically inhibited or completely prevented. Meanwhile, ripening of the sand surface by the MPs (0.6 and 0.4 mu m) no longer occurred. By contrast, all MPs in deionized water (0 PSU) achieved complete column breakthroughs because of the strong repulsive energy barrier (from 218 k(B)T to 4192 k(B)T) between the MPs and the sand surface. Consequently, we find that the transport and retention of MPs in sandy marine environment strongly relies on both the MP size and the salinity levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing transmembrane pressure (TMP) can compress and increase the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate how compression of membrane biofilms occurs and how structural rearrangement can affect hydraulic resistance. Biofilms with heterogeneous and homogeneous physical structures were grown in membrane fouling simulators (MFS) in dead-end mode for 20 days with either (i) a nutrient enriched condition with a nutrient ratio of 100:30:10 (C: N: P), (ii) a phosphorus limitation (C: N: P ratio: 100:30:0), or (iii) river water (C: N: P ratio: ca. 100:10:1). The structural and hydraulic response of membrane biofilms to (a) changes in trans membrane pressures (0.06-0.1-0.5-0.1-0.06 bar) and (b) changes in permeate flux (10-15-20-15-10 L/m(2)/h) were investigated. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to monitor biofilm structural response, and OCT images were processed to quantify changes in the mean biofilm thickness and relative roughness. Nutrient enriched and river water biofilms had heterogeneous physical structures with greater surface roughness (Ra' > 0.2) than homogeneous P limiting biofilms (Ra' < 0.2). Compression of biofilms with rough heterogeneous structures (Ra' > 0.2) was irreversible, indicated by irreversible decrease in surface roughness, partial relaxation in mean biofilm thickness and irreversible increase in hydraulic resistance. Compression of homogeneous biofilm (Ra' < 0.2) was on the other hand reversible, indicated by full relaxation of the biofilms structure and restoration of initial hydraulic resistance. Hydraulic response (i.e., change in the specific biofilm resistance) did not correspond with the change in physical structure of heterogeneous biofilms. The presented study provides a fundamental understanding of how biofilm physical structure can affect the biofilm's response to a change in TMP, with practical relevance for the operation of GDM filtration systems.

AB Removing harmful cyanobacteria intact by coagulation can prevent cell lysis and toxin release, which provides many benefits for drinking water production, including reduction of the burden on subsequent processes and guaranteeing the water quality. But the electronegativity and buoyancy of cyanobacterial cells make them settle slowly and their accumulation and concentration in flocs would still have severe adverse effects. In this study, we introduced a photocatalyst powder to act as a ballasting agent in the coagulation process and to degrade the cells and cyanotoxins during sludge storage.
   Results showed that adding N-TiO2 would decrease the coagulant dose to half of the conventional value, and also allow Microcystis aeruginosa cells to completely settle within 10 min. During sludge storage, the algal cells, cyanotoxins and other organics in sludge would be degraded to safe levels after 32 h' visible-light irradiation. Meanwhile, the N-TiO2, water and some of the coagulant in purified sludge will be directly and safely reused.
   Thus, this is an environmentally friendly and cost-effective technology which incorporates photo catalyst in algal flocs to enhance coagulation and sedimentation and to enable the sludge produced to be self-purified under visible-light. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage effluents can contain hundreds of toxic pollutants, making them a risk to humans when involved in drinking water. It is therefore important to evaluate the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents to mammalian cells. Solar light might influence the water quality of sewage effluents after their discharge into lakes or rivers, altering their cytotoxicity. In this study, natural solar light was found to lower the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Cytotoxicity of different samples decreased by 31%-65% after 12 h of simulated irradiation. Ultraviolet in sunlight was the major contributor to the cytotoxicity reduction. Aquatic reactive oxygen species (ROS), including singlet oxygen, superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, were generated in the effluents under irradiation and they contributed to part of cytotoxicity reduction. Pollutants in sewage effluents induced cytotoxicity by simultaneously elevating the levels of intracellular ROS and intracellular reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in CHO cells. Solar light and the aquatic ROS formed under irradiation reduced the cytotoxicity because the transformed pollutants in sewage effluents increased lower intracellular ROS and RNS levels. These results help reveal the detoxification mechanism of sewage effluents in natural environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Treatment of fully nitrified municipal wastewater effluents with chlorine followed by chloramines (i.e., sequential chlorine disinfection) upstream of advanced treatment trains can contribute pathogen inactivation credits for potable reuse while leaving a chloramine residual to control biofouling on membrane units in the advanced treatment train. However, free chlorine exposures must be optimized to maximize pathogen inactivation while minimizing the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that are challenging to remove in the advanced treatment train. Using a pilot-scale disinfection contactor receiving fully-nitrified, tertiary municipal wastewater effluent, this study found that a 3 mg x min/L free chlorine CT (i.e., the product of the chlorine residual "C" and the contact time "T') followed by a 140 mg x min/L chloramine CT could reliably achieve 5-log inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage and reduce median total coliform concentrations below 2.2 MPN/100 mL. Free chlorine disinfection was equally effective when chlorine was dosed to exceed the breakpoint for 1 mg/L of ammonia as N. At this free chlorine exposure, regulated trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) formation remained below their Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs), but NDMA concentrations of similar to 30 ng/L were above the 10 ng/L California Notification Level. Increasing the free chlorine exposure to similar to 30 mg x min/L increased THM and HAA formation, with regulated THM5 approaching or exceeding the M. Although this free chlorine exposure prevented NDMA formation during chloramination, the similar to 10 ng/L background NDMA formation in the tertiary effluent remained. Increasing the free chlorine exposure also increased the formation of unregulated halogenated DBP classes that may be significant contributors to the DBP-associated toxicity of the disinfected wastewater. The results indicate that sequential chlorination can be used to optimize the benefits of free chlorine (virus and NDMA control) and chloramine disinfection (THM, HAA, and coliform control).

AB Intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation (ICPB) is a novel wastewater treatment technique that has potential applications in refractory degradation. This paper reports a synergistic degradation protocol that allowing the transfer of photoelectrons between photocatalysts and microbes without supplementary electron donors or improving the loading rate of the photocatalysts. As a result, a degradation rate of similar to 94% was sustained for 400 h in a perturbation setup with a hydraulic retention time of 4.0 h. We achieved the degradation of beta-apo-oxytetracycline, a stable antimicrobial intermediate compound (half-life of 270 d in soil interstitial water), within 10 min, and no accumulation was observed. Moreover, the required loading rate of the photocatalyst was dramatically reduced to 18.3% compared to previous reports which mentioned much higher rates. The results of our study provided a new strategy to improve the degradation efficiency of oxytetracycline and give new insight into the degradation mechanism of the bio-photocatalytic degradation system.

AB Previous studies have shown that the oxidation of Fe(II) by molecular oxygen can lead to the co-oxidation of As(III) at neutral pH. However, the mechanism of As(III) oxidation in the presence of Fe(II) with respect to the interaction between As(III) and Fe(II) is still unclear. In this work, we examined the oxidation of As(Ill) in the presence of Fe(II) in air-saturated water, which is affected by pH, co-existing phosphate, and scavengers (tert-butanol, superoxide dismutase, catalase and dimethylsulfoxide). Results confirm that the formation of the Fe(II)-As(III) complex (formation constant, K-Fe(II)(-As(III))=10(3.86) M-1) plays an extremely important role in the initial stage of As(III) oxidation at pH 7.25. The oxidation of Fe(II)-As(III) promotes the production of H2O2 and colloidal ferric hydroxide. H2O2 reacts with the Fe(II)-As(III) complex through oxidizing Fe(II) to Fe(IV), which then causes the partial oxidation (ca. 50%) of As(III). The other part of As(III) oxidation by H2O2 occurs, in the form of Fe(III)-As(III) complex, through direct electron transfer from As(III) to H2O2 but not through Fe(IV). This work provides new mechanistic insight into arsenic and iron redox chemistry in the environment and furthers our understanding of Fenton reactions at neutral pH. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sludge disposal is an integral part of wastewater treatment systems, and its cost usually accounts for more than half of the total operation cost. Sludge disposal technology is facing challenges and opportunities simultaneously and can still be improved. Sludge dewatering is an essential process in sludge disposal, and it is important for the effective reduction of the final processing cost. Coagulation/flocculation is a relatively mature, cost-effective, user-friendly sludge dewatering technology. In this work, coagulation/flocculation and their combinations with other pretreatments, including dewatering mechanisms, are reviewed. Various coagulants/flocculants used in sludge dewatering, including inorganic coagulants, organic synthetic and natural polymeric flocculants, and bioflocculants, are introduced in detail because coagulants/flocculants are the key in coagulation/flocculation. The different factors that influence the dewatering performance of these coagulants/flocculants are also presented briefly. Moreover, aiming at the complicated composition of sludge and its treatment difficulty, the prospects and technical developments of coagulation/flocculation in sludge dewatering are discussed.

AB Microgranular enclaves, which can provide important petrogenetic indications for the host granitoids, are commonly observed in the Middle-Late Jurassic Cu-Pb-Zn-bearing granodiorites in the Nanling Range of South China. The origin of these Cu-Pb-Zn-bearing granodiorites is still controversial, with two different hypotheses: crust-mantle mixing and partial melting of the mafic lower crust, primarily based on geochemistry and geochronology. Detailed petrographic and mineralogical studies have been carried out on the Tongshanling granodiorite and its microgranular enclaves to provide new textural and compositional constraints on the petrogenesis. The microgranular enclaves have dioritic compositions with a mineralogy dominated by plagioclase, amphibole, and biotite. Abundant residual materials, such as mafic mineral clots, inherited and metamorphic zircon, and Ca-rich core plagioclase, occur in the enclaves and are in favor of a restite origin. The amphibole-rich clots are considered as vestiges of residual pyroxene-rich precursors from the source. Three different types of amphibole, i.e., magmatic, metamorphic, and magma reworked metamorphic amphibole, have been recognized in the granodiorite and its enclaves. The magmatic amphibole occurs as enclosed and idiomorphic isolated crystals in the granodiorite with Al and Si contents of 1.34-2.12 apfu (atoms per formula unit) and 6.25-6.88 apfu, respectively, and a Sigma REE content of 307-764 ppm. The metamorphic amphibole, with a granoblastic triple-junction texture, occurs as aggregated crystals dominantly in the enclaves and a few in the granodiorite. It has actinolitic compositions (Al: 0.31-0.81 apfu, Si: 7.33-7.72 apfu) and distinctly lower contents of incompatible elements (Sigma REE: 99-146 ppm). The magma reworked amphibole has intermediate compositions (Al: 0.81-1.59 apfu, Si: 6.71-7.35 apfu, Sigma REE: 317-549 ppm) between the magmatic and metamorphic amphibole. The zonal amphibole-rich clots exhibit increasing Al and decreasing Si contents from interior amphibole to exterior amphibole and also from core to rim in amphibole grains, and the outer parts of enclave magmatic zircon have higher ThO2 + UO2 contents and lower Zr/Hf ratios than the inner parts, showing the process of magma reworking of the restite enclaves. Based on the textural and compositional evidence, these microgranular enclaves are thought to be reworked restite enclaves. This is also supported by thermobarometric calculation. A model illustrating the formation process of reworked restite enclave has been proposed. Combined with previous experimental studies of partial melting, the Tongshanling granodiorite is deduced to be derived from dehydration melting of amphibolite in the mafic lower crust. The fertile amphibolitic source is beneficial to the formation of Cu-Pb-Zn-bearing granodiorites in the Nanling Range.

AB This paper presents petrographic and U-Pb LA-ICP-MS isotopic data of a single peraluminous intrusion (alkali-feldspar granite of Airekan) with partial gneissic foliation on the north western margin of the Yazd Block in the west of the Central-East Iranian Microcontinent (CEIM) to discuss the evolution of this terrain. This intrusion typically suggests a continental collision orogenesis along the northern frontier of Gondwana in the CEIM. The U-Pb dating of zircons indicates that Airekan granite has a distinctive inherited magmatic component at similar to 518.2 +/- 4.9 Ma but zircons with 892, 679, 614 and 554 Ma ages. These zircons were likely to be ultimately sourced from neighboring Neoproterozoic - Cambrian leucogranite terrains, similar to the other localities in the northern margin of Gondwana, along the Alpine-Himalayan belt from Europe, Turkey, NE Iran, CEIM, Pakistan, India to southern Tibet. The zircons and overgrowths around the inherited components with igneous morphology indicate a plutonism at Lower Ordovician (similar to 483 +/- 2.9 Ma). Petrographic features and morphology of zircon crystals indicate that partial resetting of the U-Pb system in zircons have occurred at similar to 382.6 +/- 3.2 Ma in Devonian, during the Paleo-Tethys evolutions in Khur region (Anarak-Jandaq terrane) in the southern active margin of Laurasia.

AB Chinese loess is generally accepted to be one of the most important archives for establishing the average geochemical compositions of the upper continental crust (UCC), assuming numerous upper crustal recycling processes. However, the effect of such recycling processes on elemental fractionation has still not been systemically and quantitatively assessed. This study investigates the trace and rare earth elements (BEE) of the < 75 mu m and < 5 mu m silicate fractions of ten deserts and sandy lands in northern China, and of Chinese loess, to evaluate the effect of grain size on element ratios. Our results indicated that BEE- and some trace elements (Y, Ta and Nb)-related ratios have the negligible effect of grain size, and can therefore be regarded as size-independent proxies to trace the source of eolian deposits. The principal component analysis (PCA) of these size-independent ratios was conducted for the deserts and loess samples. The PCA results reveal that Chinese loess was ultimately derived from the materials eroded from two tectonic settings, i.e. the northern Tibetan Plateau (NTP) and the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAO). We propose that the UCC component of Chinese loess can not only be ascribed to numerous upper crustal recycling processes, but also to the thorough mixing of materials from different tectonic settings.

AB The similar to 1200 km long north-south oriented Sagaing fault (plate boundary fault between the Burma and Sunda plates), entirely located in Myanmar, passes through some major cities, and has witnessed several major earthquakes since prehistoric time, including the recent Mw 6.8 Thabeikkyin earthquake in 2012. The Sagaing fault accommodates similar to 50-55% of dextral motion of the India-Sunda plate motion. Combined, geodetic observations and rheological considerations using topography as a proxy, we propose along strike segmentation of the Sagaing fault from centrally locked segment to creeping segment further north along the Koma fault. Such segmentation facilitates stress transfer (or loading) from creeping segment to locked segment, and influences earthquake nucleation process and along strike spatial extent of great earthquake ruptures. Topographic margins and their relative strength, predicted from the Newtonian channel flow model, also support the along strike segmentation behaviour.

AB Lamina induced fractures (LF) are abundant in lacustrine formations, playing an important role for the tight oil resource exploration. Studies of controlling factors of the LF are still lacking, especially for the heterogeneous formations characterized with complex combinations of the lamina and surrounding rock. Therefore, 28 long column samples for triaxial compression tests, 37 short column samples for Brazil split tests and 12 powder samples for mineral component analysis and isotopes analysis (carbon and oxygen) are made from 6 cores in 4 petrophysical faces. The experiments are designed to study the LF propagation process, considering the con- trolling factors in terms of mineral component, the lamina angle and the petrophysical faces. Our results show that: Clay content and dolomite cement degree more significantly control the LF propagation than the other minerals; The LF propagation is not only dependent on the mineral component in the lamina, but even more on the mineral component difference between the lamina and the surrounding rock (i.e., the L/S values), where 'L' represents the lamina and 'S' represents the surrounding rock adjacent to the lamina; The LF tended to propagate in a middle lamina angle range (approximately 10 degrees-60 degrees) in shear properties, and characterized with lower compression strength values; All the LF observed in the thin sections were associated with oil, although there was no obvious oil shown in the study cores; The delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of lamina samples varied with the lamina mineral component for the complex organic matter oxidation and degradation reactions. Additionally, the hydrocarbon flow parameter (P-HF) has been proposed on the carbon and oxidation isotope trace lines, to indicate the oil-rock reactions during the LF open period.

AB The Upper Triassic strata within the Nanzhao Basin are thought to have formed in response to the Qinling Indosinian Orogeny. Thus, the provenance record of this succession can be used to trace the basin-mountain interactions by using petrology and zircon geochronology. The Upper Triassic sandstones of the Nanzhao Basin are composed of a moderate proportion of quartz along with a comparable volume of feldspar and lithic fragments and the compositions plot mainly within orogenic source areas. The detrital zircon age spectra of these strata display six prominent age peaks at 232 Ma, between 420 and 442 Ma, and at 750, 914, 1828, and 2452 Ma and are inferred to have been derived from the South Qinling Belt, North Qinling Belt, and southern North China Block. The sediments sourced from the South Qinling Belt are thought to have evolved from Triassic volcanic rocks to basement units indicating that an unroofing process occurred within this orogenic region. In contrast, the North Qinling Belt acted as a continuous source, while the southern North China Block evolved into an accessory source in the late stages of the basin evolution. It is apparent that the Nanzhao Basin received an influx of clastic detritus from both the southern and northern source areas indicating that this region was isolated within the North Qinling Belt. Thus, the Nanzhao Basin can be defined as a wedge top depozone of the southern North China foreland basin system. Tuff zircons with a single age peak at 225 Ma are thought to be related to a volcanic eruption that occurred towards the southern margin of the South Qinling Belt. This hypothesis implies the existence of subduction along the Mianlve Suture before the early Late Triassic, which is consistent with both oblique collision and unequal margin collisional models.

AB The Civril Graben System (CGS) is one of the important tectonic structures developed within the Western Anatolia extensional tectonic regime. The CGS has an arcuate geometry looking south, and comprises two main geometric sections of the NW-striking Dinar Graben and the NE-striking Baklan Graben, with a total length of 100 km. The main faults limit the north edge of the CGS, while the south edge is bounded by their antithetic structures. The northern boundary structures of the graben comprise two main fault segments of Dinar and Civril. Graben fill is Plio-Quaternary lacustrine-fluvial sediments with Late Pleistocene-Holocene flood plain, lacustrine-marsh and alluvial fan sediments. Historical records and destructive earthquakes occurred in the last century indicate the region is one of the significant seismogenic zones. The last destructive earthquake in the graben was the 1995 Dinar Earthquake (Mw 6.2) which caused approximately 10 km-long surface rupture on the Kszills segment of the Dinar Fault. Field-based geological mapping and structural geology in this study and available seismic and paleoseismological data reveal that the other sub-segments of the Dinar and Civril faults which have not ruptured in the last 150 years have the potential to produce earthquakes with Mw 6.0 and larger. The paleoseismic rate is assessed to be 1 mm/year for the Kizilli segment, while the geologically long term slip rate range is calculated to be 0.27 +/- 0.05 mm/year.

AB Today the existence of tropical rainforests in the Indian subcontinent is restricted to the fringes of the Western Ghats, greater Assam region and some small places in Odisha. However, the palaeovegetation reconstruction in this study illustrates the existence of equatorial tropical forest in northwestern India (Bikaner, Rajasthan) during the early Eocene. Fossil leaves, described here, were collected from the Gurha lignite mine of Bikaner and showed affinities with Holigarna grahamii (Anacardiaceae), Pterygota alata (Malvaceae), Syzygiurn spp. (S. fruticosum and S. cumini) (Myrtaceae), and Gardenia spp. (G. lucida and G. gummiefra) (Rubiaceae). Contrary to the present-day dry and desertic conditions, the fossil records provide strong evidence of humid tropical and paratropical evergreen forest with monsoon seasonality existing in and around the study area during the depositional period. Any shift in climatic conditions has drastic effects on the vegetation cover of a region in time and space. This drastic change in climate has led to the extinction of tropical rain forest from this region. This might be due to the northward movement of the Indian subcontinent (away from the equator), formation of the Himalayas and monsoon or changes in monsoon pattern.

AB In Central Vietnam, the Kontum massif is subdivided from North to South into: (i) Kham Duc, (ii) Ngoc Linh, (iii) Kan Nack complexes. The Kham Duc complex consists of metapelite, metapsammite, paragneiss, metagabbro, amphibolite, serpentinized ultramafic, and orthogneiss blocks. The southern part of this complex experienced an Early Paleozoic crustal melting event responsible for migmatites and anatectic granites. The Ngoc Linh complex, the largest one, is formed by metatexite and granitoid enclosing blocks of eclogite, high pressure (HP) granulite, orthogneiss, metagabbro, amphibolite, granodiorite, and migmatite. The Kan Nack complex is formed by migmatites with (ultra) high temperature (U)HT granulite, charnockites and enderbites. The three metamorphic complexes are intruded by per-aluminous granite, and subordinate mafic plutons. In spite of local variations, the foliation of the Ngoc Linh complex defines a bulk domal structure, and the stretching lineation consistently trends NW-SE. The NW-SE lineation is also observed in the tectonically overlying the Kan Nack complex. The Ngoc Linh and Kan Nack complexes are interpreted here as parts of a metamorphic core complex (MCC), or "Ngoc Linh MCC", exhumed by a top-to-the-NW detachment fault. Along the northern margin of the Ngoc Linh MCC, upright folds with E-W striking axes, and E-W stretching lineation deform the foliation. These structures are developed in a transpressive regime coeval with the activity of plurikilometer-scale dextral strike-slip faults. Zircon and monazite U/Pb radiometric datings document a 250-240 Ma age for the crustal melting, and the top-to-the-NW ductile shearing coeval with the formation of the Ngoc Linh MCC. This extensional tectonics is followed by a dextral strike-slip faulting, at ca 240-230 Ma, before the emplacement of the two-mica granitic plutons at ca 240-224 Ma. Furthermore in the Ngoc Linh and Kan Nack complexes, zircon and monazite yield U-Pb Early Paleozoic ages. In the Kham Duc complex, a ca 460 Ma MP/MT, garnet-biotite-staurolite-kyanite metamorphism, followed by migmatites at ca 450 Ma, is also recognized. The 420-400 Ma age of the Dai Loc plutonic suite, and the 450-425 Ma age of the Dien Binh calc-alkaline granodiorite document an Early Paleozoic event. The Early Paleozoic mafic and ultramafic masses of the Hiep Duc complex are ophiolites included into a metasedimentary matrix. Thus, the Kham Duc complex is interpreted as a tectonic melange formed during a collisional orogeny that subsequently underwent crustal melting giving rise to the migmatites. A part of the Early Paleozoic rocks are enclosed as xenoliths in the Triassic migmatite of the Ngoc Linh MCC. These petrologic, structural, and chronological features allow us to propose the following geodyrtamic evolution for the Kontum massif. During the Early Paleozoic, a continental collision, which was accommodated by a north-directed subduction of a southern block (S. Vietnam, or Viet-Cambodia block) below a northern block (N. Vietnam or Viet-Lao block), occurred along the Tam Ky-Phuoc Son suture. During the Early Triassic, at ca 250-245 Ma, the S. Vietnam block experienced a crustal melting giving rise to the Ngoc Linh MCC that reworked the Early Paleozoic orogen. Lastly, during the Middle Triassic, the dextral faulting superimposed upon the Ngoc Linh migmatite. The geodynamic significance of the Kontum massif is discussed in the general framework of Indochina-South China relationships.
   The Early Paleozoic collision in Vietnam is viewed as the driving force responsible for the development of the intracontinental orogeny of S. China. In order to account for the important heat flow required for the formation of UHT metamorphic rocks, a possible interaction between the SCB-Indochina collision, and the Emeishan mantle plume is proposed.

AB Potassium and ultrapotassium magmas with potential origins in the upper mantle are common and widely distributed on the Earth. Previous experimental studies have suggested that K can significantly decrease the partial melting T of the peridotite. Since K has a strong effect on the melt composition, and on the molar partition coefficient of some cations such as Mg between the olivine and melt, D-Mg(Ol/liq), it can substantially affect the T estimation of the Ol geothermometers. However, none of the presently available geothermometers have critically considered the effect of K in this paper, we have collected a large number of composition data of the Ol-melt equilibrium pairs covering a large range of K2O contents in the melts, and have successfully calibrated three K2O-dependent geothermometers on the basis of the MgO partition between the Ol and basaltic magma, two Ol geothermometers and one melt composition geothermometer. The database covers the P range from 1 atm to 7 GPa and T range of 1087-1950 degrees C. Compared to some other geothermometers, our Ol geothennometers reproduce the experimental T very well, with the average of the absolute differences between the calculated T and experimental T being only 14(15) degrees C at room P and 25(21) degrees C at high P, and with these differences showing no clear dependence on the P, T, and contents of K2O and any other oxides in the melts. Furthermore, our melt composition geothermometer allows excellent T estimate for the silicate magma coexisting with Ol by using the melt composition alone. The application of our melt composition geothermometer to the Somma-Vesuvius volcanic complex in Italy demonstrates that this geothermometer can lead to reasonable T estimates for the high potassium silicate magmas, even there are small amounts of volatiles such as H2O and CO2 in the melts.

AB The Paleoproterozoic Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt (JLJB) in the North China Craton, a major terrane boundary, has remained controversial with respect to its tectonic history. Here we report LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages, and whole-rock elemental and isotopic compositions of mafic rocks intruding into the North and South Liaohe Groups, with the aim of evaluating their petrogenetic affinities and metamorphic history, and their implications for the tectonic evolution of the JLJB. The mafic rocks in the North Liaohe Group dominantly composed of meta-diabase and meta-gabbro, whereas mafic rocks in the South Liaohe Group are mainly (garnet-) amphibolite. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb analyses yield crystallization and metamorphic ages of ca. 2130 Ma and ca. 1880 Ma, respectively, suggesting that they are coeval, and were metamorphosed at the same time. Whole-rock elemental and isotopic compositions suggest tholeiitic affinity for the protoliths of both of them, with variable SiO2 and MgO concentrations and Mg# and eNd(t) values. They both display enriched mid-oceanic-ridge basalt (E-MORB)-like trace element patterns with enrichment in light rare earth elements and depletion in some high field strength elements (HFSEs; e.g., Nb, Ta, and Ti). The data suggest derivation of the melts from a depleted asthenospheric mantle, coupled with fractional crystallization and crustal contamination. Some of the mafic rocks in the South Liaohe Group have lower HFSE (e.g., Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and Ti) concentrations, and La/Sm and Th/La ratios, and higher U/Th ratios than their counterparts in the North Liaohe Group, possibly suggesting enhanced metasomatism by subduction-related fluids and/or melts. The geochemical features of the mafic rocks from JLJB contrast with those of typical intra-continental rifts and volcanic arcs, and may have formed in a back-arc basin. Our study supports the presence of a ca. 2.2-2.1 Ga back-arc basin that formed due to northward subduction and subsequent closure of an oceanic plate, resulting in arc-continent collision and formation of the JLJB at ca. 1.9 Ga.

AB A high resolution petromagnetic analysis demonstrates that pedogenic alterations in Holocene loess (sand) sequences from the regions of the Guanzhong Basin and the Mu Us Desert on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) were affected by climatic variations in temperature and precipitation. Three warm-humid intervals (similar to 8.4-3.7, similar to 2.4-1.2, and similar to 0.81-0.48 ka), associated with soil formation and relatively high values of petromagnetic parameters, occurred during the Holocene. A substantial paleosol development from similar to 8.4 to 3.7 ka and higher petromagnetic parameter values indicate a generally strong warm-humid phase in the mid-Holocene which can be attributed to the Holocene climatic optimum. Our study demonstrates that the Holocene climate in the eastern part of the CLP is sensitive to warming and cooling events linked to global changes in temperature and precipitation. A complete Holocene climate record is constructed, correlating well with the other regional climate records along the south-to-north profile on eastern CLP, and suggesting that similar climatic changes occurred in eastern monsoonal China during the Holocene. Results are supported by other climate records in different regions of the world, and imply that the Holocene climatic optimum in the northern hemisphere probably took place at the same time.

   GENESIS
AB The iron-copper-gold belt in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River region is among the most important metallogenic provinces in eastern China. The Luzong (Lujiang-Zongyang) ore district hosts many significant iron deposits in the Luzong Basin and is an important part of this belt The Yangshan deposit is hosted in the Cretaceous volcanic rocks of the middle Luzong Basin. The Makou deposit in the southern-central Luzong Basin has orebodies at the contact between gabbro-diorite and volcanic rocks of the Zhuanqiao Formation. There are three types of magnetite in these two deposits: (1) magmatic magnetite from the Makou gabbro-diorite, (2) hydrothermal magnetite from the Makou deposit, and (3) hydrothermal magnetite in the volcanic rocks from the Yangshan deposit. Magmatic magnetite from gabbro-diorite in the Makou deposit has concentrations of elements, Mg, Al, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Zn, higher than hydrothermal magnetite. Magmatic magnetite from the Makou deposit are the highest concentrations of Cr, Sc, Ni, Al, and Zn, but hydrothermal magnetite from this deposit has the lowest concentrations of these elements, whereas hydrothermal magnetite from the Yangshan deposit contains intermediate concentrations of these elements. Overall, there are positive correlations between Mg and Al, and Ti and Mn. The Makou and Yangshan hydrothermal magnetite show highly variable Mg values, apparently influenced by clinopyroxene (diopside) crystallisation from hydrothermal fluids. The Ti, Ga and Sn contents of the Makou hydrothermal magnetite are generally higher than those from the Yangshan deposit, suggesting the Makou magnetite formed under higher temperatures. The formation of Al-IV-rich clinopyroxene in the Yangshan deposit may have resulted in the low V content of magnetite, whereas the high Cr content may have been derived from the associated trachyandesite. Leaching of thick volcanic sequences via magmatic fluids may have led to the incorporation of certain elements into the ore-forming fluids, resulting in higher Al, Mn, and Zn concentrations in the Yangshan magnetite. The Makou hydrothermal magnetite has Na and K contents similar but Ca content higher than that of the magmatic magnetite, indicating that Na and K were retained in the melt, but Ca was enriched in the fluid. Both the Makou and Yangshan hydrothermal magnetites contain high V and low Cr concentrations and resemble magnetite in IOA deposits elsewhere. Combined with the wall rocks and mineral assemblages the Makou and Yangshan deposits are best classified as magnetite-apatite deposits. Intensive diopside alteration in these two deposits may be related to the marine sedimentary strata at the depth.

AB Thailand is surrounded by seismically active plate boundary zones and large-offset crustal faults, but there is comparatively little seismic activity within its borders. On 5 May 2014, a moment magnitude (M-w) 6.2 earthquake occurred in the Mae Lao district of northern Thailand. To better anticipate future seismic hazards from events like this, we model the state of stress in Thailand and its vicinity using a finite element approach. We identify northern Thailand as a region with significant stress accumulation, consistent with being caused by convergence at the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone and southward escape of the Himalayan Orogen. The stress field in this region is compatible with the kinematics of the Mae Lao event. Our modeling also shows that the magnitude of the stress field throughout southeast Asia is particularly sensitive to the stage of the earthquake cycle at the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone, although the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone produces a smaller effect on the orientations of stresses in the source region of the Mae Lao earthquake. Finally, we find that the stress change effect from the Mae Lao earthquake is geographically limited and the broader region remains in nearly the same state of stress as prior to the event.

AB Development of recombinant protective antigen (rPA)-based anthrax vaccines has been hindered by a lack of stability of the vaccines associated with spontaneous deamidation of asparagine (Asn) residues of the rPA antigen during storage. In this study, we explored the role that two deamidation-prone Asn residues located directly adjacent to the receptor binding site of PA, Asn(713) and Asn(719), play in the stability of rPA-based anthrax vaccines. We modified these residues to glutamine (Gln) and generated rPA (N713Q/N719Q), since Gln would not be expected to deamidate on a time scale relevant to vaccine storage. While wild-type rPA vaccine formulated with aluminum hydroxide lost immunogenicity upon storage, as measured by induction of toxin-neutralizing antibodies in mice, the rPA(N713Q/N719Q) vaccine did not exhibit a significant loss in immunogenicity. This finding suggests that modification of Asn713 and Asn719 of rPA to deamidation-resistant amino acids may improve the stability of rPA-based anthrax vaccines. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins elicit protective antibody responses and therefore, are used as targets for vaccination, especially the HA protein. However, these proteins are subject to antigenic drift, decreasing vaccine efficacy, and few to no studies have analyzed antigenic variability of these proteins by growing the viruses under immune pressure provided by human sera. In this work, we show that after growing different influenza virus strains under immune pressure, the selection of amino acid changes in the NA protein is much more limited than the selection in the HA protein, suggesting that the NA protein could remain more conserved under immune pressure. Interestingly, all the mutations in the HA and NA proteins affected protein antigenicity, and many of the selected amino acid changes were located at the same positions found in viruses circulating. These studies could help to inform HA and NA protein residues targeted by antibody responses after virus infection in humans and are very relevant to update the strains used for influenza virus vaccination each year and to improve the currently available vaccines.

AB Group A rotavirus causes a substantial proportion of diarrhoea related deaths worldwide among children under five years. We analyzed rotavirus prevalence and genotypes distribution among patients admitted with diarrhoea at icddr,b hospital in Dhaka during 2012-16. Stool specimens (n = 1110) were collected from diarrhoea patients and tested for RVA antigen using enzyme immunoassay. Rotavirus positive samples were G (VP7) and P (VP4) genotyped by RT-PCR and sanger sequencing. Data on clinical manifestations were collected from icddr,b hospital surveillance system. A total of 351 (32%) patients were positive for rotavirus antigen, about half of those were children under two years old. During the study period, GIP [8] (27%) was the most prevalent strain, followed by G12P[8] (15%) and G9[P4] (9%). Mixed G or P genotypes were identified in a substantial proportion (23%) with few strains of rare combinations such as GIP [4], GIP[6], G2P[6], G2P[8], G9P[6]. The genotypic fluctuation was noteworthy; G12P[8] was the major strain in 2012-14 but sharply decreased in 2015-16 when G1 P[8] became the most common strain. G3P[8] re-emerged (17%) in 2016 after 11 years. Since the Government of Bangladesh has planned to include rotavirus vaccine in national immunization programme from 2018, our data will provide baseline information on rotavirus genotypes in the pre-vaccination era to observe the selection pressure on genotypes in the post vaccination epoch.

AB GARDASIL (R) 9, a 9-valent vaccine against human papillomavirus (9vHPV), was developed to prevent diseases mediated by HPV types 6/11/16/18/31133/45/52/58. During the development of the vaccine, three nonclinical safety studies were conducted to evaluate repeat-dose toxicity and prenatal and postnatal developmental toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats. In all studies, the vaccine was administered via intramuscular injections of 0.5 mL (the human dose) divided equally into each quadriceps muscle. In the repeat dose toxicity study, potential local and systemic toxic effects of the 9vHPV vaccine were evaluated after 4 doses given 21 days apart and after a 21-day recovery period. In the prenatal study, virgin females were dosed at 5 and 2 weeks prior to mating and on Gestation Day [GD] 6 (3 total doses). Potential postnatal developmental toxicity of the vaccine formulation was evaluated after 4 total doses (premating to lactation). There were no treatment-related unscheduled deaths in any studies. In the 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study, no adverse effects in male or female rats were observed. Anticipated systemic effects representing immunological responses and local inflammatory reactions at the injection sites were noted in the vaccine-treated groups, with a trend toward recovery by the end of the 21-day recovery period. In the prenatal developmental toxicity study, there was no evidence of toxicity in females given the vaccine. There were no effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the parental females and no evidence of developmental toxicity. In the postnatal study, there was no evidence of toxicity in vaccine-treated females and no evidence of developmental toxicity based on standard postnatal parameters, including behavioral testing and reproductive performance. The vaccine induced antibody responses in all studies and vaccine-specific antibodies were detected in offspring in the developmental toxicity studies. These results support the favorable safety profile of GARDASIL (R) 9. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe infections in immunocompro-mised individuals and in patients with cystic fibrosis. A range of vaccines to prevent infections caused by P. aeruginosa has already been tested, yet no vaccine against this pathogen is currently available. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (BSA-NPs) associated with total P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 antigens in inducing protection against the infection with virulent P. aeruginosa PA14 strain in murine model of nasal infection. Swiss mice were immunized with BSA-NPs associated with total P. aeruginosa antigens (NPPa) or empty NPs (NPe). As positive and negative control, groups of animals were immunized with total antigens of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and phosphate buffered saline, respectively. Immunized mice were infected via nasal route using P. aeruginosa PA14 strain. The survival after 48 h was evaluated and the lungs from animals were processed for quantification of bacterial load, cytokine expression and histopathological analysis. After infection with P. aeruginosa PA14, animals immunized with NPPa had the highest survival rate, the lowest bacterial lung load, a controlled production of cytokines and few histopathological changes. These results indicate that NPPa immunization protected mice from infection, contributing for the elimination of the bacteria from the lungs, which consequently reflected the survival of the animals. Therefore, this vaccine was able to induce a functional response in an animal model of lethal infection and thereby is a promising platform for P. aeruginosa vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose: Measure the preferences of decision makers and researchers associated with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the recommended format for presenting health economics studies to the ACIP.
   Methods: We conducted key informant interviews and an online survey of current ACIP work group members, and current and previous ACIP voting members, liaison representatives, and ex-officio members to understand preferences for health economics presentations. These preferences included the presentation of results and sensitivity analyses, the role of health economics studies in decision making, and strategies to improve guidelines for presenting health economics studies. Best-worst scaling was used to measure the relative value of seven attributes of health economics presentations in vaccine decision making.
   Results: The best-worst scaling survey had a response rate of 51% (n = 93). Results showed that summary results were the most important attribute for decision making (mean importance score: 0.69) and intermediate outcomes and disaggregated results were least important (mean importance score: 0.71). Respondents without previous health economics experience assigned sensitivity analysis lower importance and relationship of the results to other studies higher importance than the experienced group (sensitivity analysis scores: 0.15 vs. 0.15 respectively; relationship of the results: 0.13 vs. 0.12 respectively). Key informant interviews identified areas for improvement to include additional information on the quality of the analysis and increased role for liaisons familiar with health economics.
   Conclusion: Additional specificity in health economics presentations could allow for more effective presentations of evidence for vaccine decision making. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Effective, programmatically suitable influenza vaccines are needed for low-resource countries.
   Materials and methods: This phase II, placebo-controlled, randomized safety and immunogenicity trial (NCT01819155) was conducted in Senegal using the 2012-2013 Northern Hemisphere trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) formulation. Participants were allocated in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive TIV (full-dose for all age groups), adjuvanted TIV (ally), or placebo. Participants were stratified into age groups: 6-11, 12-35, and 36-71 months. All participants were vaccine-naive and received two doses of study vaccine 4 weeks apart. The two independent primary objectives were to estimate the immunogenicity of TIV and of aTIV as the proportion of children with a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer of >= 1:40 to each vaccine strain at 28 days post-dose two. Safety was evaluated by solicited local and systemic reactions, unsolicited adverse events, and serious adverse events.
   Results: 296 children received TIV, aTIV, or placebo, and 235 were included in the final analysis. After two doses, children aged 6-11, 12-35, and 36-71 months receiving TIV had HI titers >= 1:40 against A/H1N1 (73.1%, 94.1%, and 97.0%), A/H3N2 (96.2%, 100.0%, and 100.0%), and B (80.8%, 97.1%, and 97.0%), respectively. After two doses, 100% children aged 6-11, 12-35, and 36-71 months receiving aTIV had >= 1:40 titers against A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B. After a single dose, the aTIV response was comparable to or greater than the TIV response for all vaccine strains. TIV and aTIV reactogenicity were similar, except for mild elevation in temperature (37.5-38.4 degrees C) which occurred more frequently in aTIV than TIV after each vaccine dose. TIV and aTIV had similarly increased pain/tenderness at the injection site compared to placebo.
   Conclusions: Both aTIV and full-dose TIV were well-tolerated and immunogenic in children aged 6-71 months. These vaccines may play a role in programmatically suitable strategies to prevent influenza in low-resource settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Although pneumococcal disease burden in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia is considered high, comprehensive surveillance data on pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) effects are lacking.
   Methods: Sterile isolates from patients in Kuwait (2003-2016) and Saudi Arabia (aged <= 5 years, 2000-2010; all patients, 2011-2015) were included. Serotyped isolates were classified by inclusion in the 7-valent (PCV7) or 13-valent PCV (PCV13); isolates of other serotypes were classified as "non-PCV13". Isolate frequency (number of isolates/year) and classification of isolates according to vaccine type were assessed by period (before PCV, after PCV7, and after PCV13 introduction).
   Results: In Kuwait, the frequency of collected isolates was highest after PCV7 introduction. Decreased frequency of PCV7 serotypes was seen after PCV13 introduction compared with before PCV and after PCV7 introduction. Increased frequency of the 6 additional serotypes in PCV13 and non-PCV13 serotypes was observed after PCV7 introduction with a subsequent decrease in the 6 additional serotypes in PCV13 and non-PCV13 serotypes after PCV13 introduction. The percentage of isolates of vaccine serotypes in Kuwait decreased over time. In Saudi Arabia, the frequency of collected isolates was highest after PCV7 introduction. An increased frequency of PCV7 serotypes was observed after PCV7 introduction, with a further decrease after PCV13 introduction. For the 6 additional serotypes in PCV13, an increased frequency was seen after PCV7 and PCV13 introduction compared to before PCV introduction. For non-PCV13 serotypes, an increased frequency was observed after PCV13 introduction compared to after PCV7 introduction. The percentage of isolates covered by PCV13 serotypes was similar across periods, while a substantial decrease in isolates covered by PCV7 was seen after PCV13 introduction.
   Conclusion: PCVs in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia resulted in decreased frequency of some vaccine serotypes and an emergence of some non-PCV13 serotypes. Further investigation is warranted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Influenza becomes epidemic worldwide every year, and many individuals receive vaccination annually. Quality control relating to safety and potency of influenza vaccines is important to maintain public confidence. The safety of influenza vaccines has been assessed by clinical trials, and animal safety tests are performed to monitor the consistent quality between vaccines used for clinical trials and marketing; the biological responses in vaccinated animals are evaluated, including changes in body weight and white blood cell count. Animal safety tests have been contributing to the quality relating to the safety of influenza vaccines for decades, but improvements are needed. Although precise mechanisms involving biological changes in animal safety tests have not been fully elucidated, the application of cDNA microarray technology make it possible to reliably identify genes related to biological responses in vaccinated animals. From analysis of the expression profile of >10,000 genes of lung in animals treated with an inactivated whole virion influenza vaccine, we identified 17 marker genes whose expression patterns correlated well to changes in body weight and leukocyte count in vaccinated animals. In influenza HA vaccine-treated animals exhibiting subtle changes in biological responses, a robust expression pattern of marker genes was found. Furthermore, these marker genes could also be used in the evaluation of adjuvanted influenza vaccines. The expression profile of marker genes is expected to be an alternative indicator for safety control of various influenza vaccines conferring high sensitivity and short turnaround time. Thus, gene expression profiling may be a powerful tool for safety control of vaccines in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pumps used as Turbines (PATs) are a viable and low-cost technology of energy converters suitable for small-scale and in-pipe energy generation from water resources. However, amongst the main barriers to PAT technology diffusion is the unavailability of the characteristic curves of most hydraulic pumps on the market when used as turbines. Several methods exist in the literature to derive the shape of head and power characteristic curves of a PAT knowing its Best Efficiency Point (BEP). Such methods based on fixed-coefficient polynomials have been assessed here in a cross-comparison and a new method was developed based on a database of 113 experimentally tested PAT curves, which proved to reproduce the behaviour of the sampled machines more accurately by improving the overall goodness of fit up to 60%, 37% and 5% according to the different selected indicators. Finally, the mechanical efficiency and system efficiency of a PAT under variable flow rates has been compared and contrasted with that of conventional hydro turbines.

AB A new system for providing multiple outputs from solar energy capture (multi-generation) is proposed. The main objective of the system is to supply electricity, heating, cooling, and water to the residential sectors. The proposed system uses solar energy as its source to integrate two Rankine Cycle, a single effect absorption system, an electrolyser unit and a Reverse Osmosis desalination system. The system employs, as a working fluid, a molten salt, for a parabolic trough solar collector cycle, and Lithium bromide-water as a working fluid in the absorption system. The main objectives of this research are firs to analyze the system through energetic and exergetic, then evaluate the system from environment point of view. The effects of various parameters on the system efficiency and production are evaluated and the results show that the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the system are 33.52 and 20.69%, respectively. In addition, the results of the environment assessment shows that if the system works in an environment with a lower ambient temperature is more efficient.

AB Advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage system plays an important role in smoothing out the fluctuated power from renewable energy. Under different operation modes of charge-discharge process, thermodynamic behavior of system will vary. In order to optimize system performance, four operation modes of charge-discharge process are proposed in this paper. The performance difference of four modes is compared with each other based on energy analysis and exergy analysis. The results show that exergy efficiency of mode 4 is the highest, 55.71%, and exergy density of mode 2 is the largest, 8.09 x 10(6) J m(-3), when design parameters of system are identical. The second heat exchanger has the most improvement potential in elevating system performance. In addition, a parametric analysis and multi-objective optimization are also carried out to assess the effects of several key parameters on system performance.

AB The concentrated solar power technology used in schemes of cogeneration for the production of power and heat, or power and cooling is an interesting option to develop in Chile, mainly due to the high solar potential. Besides, cogeneration is an option to face the demand for energy in terms of electricity, industrial heat or cooling, which is increasing in Chile in recent years. A concentrated solar power cogeneration plant based in parabolic trough technology with a backup system of a biogas heater and a direct steam generation scheme is proposed. The cogeneration study considers two different plants, one for power and heat, and other for power and cooling, which were studied in Santiago, Chile. The results show a benefit in fossil fuels replacement when the cogeneration plant is compared to a conventional plant for production of industrial heat. In the case of cooling, electricity savings are achieved when the cogeneration plant is compared to a conventional vapor-compression system. The cooling demand can be supplied totally using an absorption chiller in the cogeneration scheme, reaching electricity energy saving of up to 99%. For cogeneration of power and heat the energy replacement in the industrial heat process are as minimum 69% depending on the demand and configuration of the plant, and can reach up to 100%. Finally, when the biogas heater is disconnected from the plant to consider a case only based in the concentrated solar power plant, the cogeneration scheme for cooling can reach an electricity saving of 4%. The cogeneration scheme for heat can reach an energy replacement of 14% as minimum.

AB A tool for holistic energy simulation and optimization of urban rail vehicles is presented. The modular vehicle model consists of easy to parameterize subsystems. All essential energy consuming subsystems (traction system and auxiliaries) can be considered via models of adequate detail level. Interaction between subsystems is simulated and driven by the operational conditions and internal controllers. Apart from energy signals the tool provides many other time signals, which contain valuable information for the vehicle manufacturer. Different workflow variants of the tool enable a case specific simulation or optimization. Furthermore a superordinated multi-objective mixed-integer optimization (MOMIO) can be applied to optimize the rail vehicle with respect to design parameters and operational conditions. Additionally a Brute-Force-Method (BFM) simulating all possible combinations enables to analyze the sensitivity of objectives (e.g. total energy) with respect to the selected design variables.

AB The performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is tightly related to relevant parameters associated with the internal multi-physicochemical processes. Accurate identification of these parameters is considerably important for modelling the voltage versus current (V-I) characteristic of SOFCs. In this paper, an improved teaching-learning based algorithm (TLBO) referred to as RTLBO is proposed to identify the exact values for these parameters. The parameter identification of SOFCs is transformed into a minimization optimization problem. The mean square error (MSE) between the measured output voltage and the calculated output voltage is used as the objective function. TLBO has been shown to be competitive with other population-based algorithms. However, its convergence rate is relatively slow especially for complex optimization problems. Inspired by the ranking mechanism in the actual scenarios of teaching-learning process, a ranking based learner selection method is proposed and integrated into both the teacher and learner phases of RTLBO. In RTLBO, poor learners are more likely to be eliminated from the current class in the ranking based teacher phase and good learners are more likely to be chosen to interact with others in the ranking based learner phase, which hence can improve the overall performance of the class quickly. The experimental results on a 5-kW SOFC stack comprehensively demonstrate that RTLBO is able to achieve a better trade-off between the exploration and exploitation compared with twelve advanced TLBO variants and eight popular advanced non-TLBO based methods. In addition, the sensitivity of RTLBO to variations of population size is empirically investigated.

AB Thermoelectric technology is a promising solution to recover waste heat from different resources. There are numerous researches in the literature that measure performance of thermoelectric modules (TEMs). A comprehensive review of research studies that classifies and expounds disparities between various thermoelectric power generation (TEPG) systems is still unavailable and therefore, this paper reviews major concerns on their designs and performances. Firstly, various main elements of TEPG systems, which affect the output power of TEMs such as stabilizer or heat exchanger, interface, contact pressure, insulation, cooling system, and integrity are studied. Secondly, performances of test rigs and various prototypes are reviewed in detail based on their cooling methods since cooling is the most prominent factor among other counterparts. In general, the cooling unit is divided into either passive or active cooling system, which is selected based on its well-defined use. A comprehensive study on various test rigs with active cooling systems is given while a broader range in prototypes is covered and classified under detailed surveys. This review is expected to be of value for researchers in the field of thermoelectric. Overall, in order to have a prospective future towards commercialization of TEPG systems, the existing prototypes in the literature are still subjected to many enhancements in their design aspects, while further improvements are needed to be achieved independently in TEMs' development.

AB This paper proposes strategies to optimize the daily charge and discharge schedule of a battery bank, in order to minimize the operating cost of a building that uses renewable energy sources. The schedule was optimized using a range of battery charge and discharge rates over a 24 h period. These rates were controlled using a genetic algorithm (GA) and a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), which utilized day-ahead prediction data for electricity consumption and electricity price, as well as electricity output from a photovoltaic system and a wind turbine. The results showed that the building operating costs decreased as the number of available charge and discharge rates was increased. The average daily operating cost was reduced by up to 31% using the GA and by up to 28% using the PSO, compared to the scenario where no battery was used. Furthermore, the reduction in average daily operating costs began to plateau as the number of charge and discharge rates reached 12. It was also shown that the scaling of irradiance, wind speed and electricity price inputs impacted the optimized daily operating cost of the building. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate how this scaling of inputs affected the overall performance of the GA. It was found that the optimized daily operating costs were almost unchanged after numerous scaling percentages were applied to the electricity price, with additional cost reductions of up to 3% compared to the scenario where no scaling percentages were applied. In contrast, scaling percentages applied to weather data were found to have a more significant impact on the optimized operating costs, with additional cost reductions of up to 17% compared to the scenario where no scaling percentages were applied. Moreover, a non-linear relationship was observed between the weather data scaling percentage and optimized daily cost.

AB A heterogeneous catalyst, magnesium zirconate (Mg2Zr5O12) was synthesized by co-precipitation and was used for biodiesel production via transesterification. Kusum oil was used as a feedstock. Catalyst characterization was accomplished by TGA, XRD, ATR FTIR, SEM, and EDX. The parameters viz. particle size, zeta potential, BET surface area and basicity of the catalyst were also determined. Characterization of catalyst supports the formation of single phase Mg(2)Zr(5)O(12 )and the catalyst was able to catalyse the transesterification reaction for economically viable biodiesel production. Various reaction parameters such as molar ratio (methanol: oil), catalyst concentration and reaction time were optimized in presence of Mg2Zr5O12 by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design. The catalyst was reusable up to seven runs with 75% conversion in the seventh run.
   Maximum conversion of 97.98% FAME was obtained at 18:1 M ratio (methanol: oil), 2.5 wt% of catalyst at 65 degrees C temperature for 150 min. Physicochemical properties of FAME were also studied as per ASTM standard method.

AB The thermal performance of a plate fin heat sink was investigated as a function of the location of multiple heat sources to minimize the thermal interference effect. Numerical analysis was performed under forced-convection conditions to design a cooling system for a high-power heat source. The thermal behaviors of the heat sink and surrounding air were simulated. We also investigated the thermal performances of various base thicknesses under local heat flux conditions to determine the optimal heat sink base thickness using the width of the heat source and conduction coefficient of the heat sink. The optimal location was determined by investigating the effects of the Reynolds number, thermal conductivity of the heat sink, heat transfer rate ratio for multiple heat sources, and width of the heat source. An installation guideline of the plate fin heat sink was prepared to help users avoid the thermal interference effect depending on the width of their heat source. By applying a correlation equation to obtain the optimal location where the maximal temperature of the heat source is minimized, the thermal resistance was decreased by up to 30%.

AB This article presents a novel comprehensive approach for the selection of the most appropriate working fluids and the conceptual design of vapor-compression refrigeration cycles, subject to minimal overall conductance for fixed cooling capacity with fixed temperatures of the external fluids entering the condenser and the evaporator. The approach consists of three sequential steps: the first step is the refrigerant independent calculation of the minimum thermal conductance of the system via constrained optimization. The second law analysis constrains the optimization problem where some thermodynamic considerations of h-s diagram and equivalent temperature concept provide the ability to calculate the entropy generation in each component of the system. The optimization results establish thermodynamic criteria for the pre-selection of potential refrigerants. Since the optimum conditions obtained are expressed in terms of equivalent temperatures, in the second step, a reconstruction procedure is introduced to correlate the equivalent temperatures with the essential thermodynamic character. istics of the system such as working pressures, temperatures, and mass flow rate for each pre-selected refrigerant. The last step of the approach is the final selection of the optimal refrigerant among the candidates using a capital-operating cost performance criterion. A case study was presented to illustrate the application of the novel selection approach.

AB The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system powered by exhaust heat has great potential in improving engine performance. Many optimizations of the only ORC system were conducted, while the existing literature pays limited attention to the optimization of the engine-ORC combined system. By considering the importance of interaction, cooperation, and influence between the engine and ORC system, a global optimization of the diesel engine-ORC combined system (herein, the combined system) is conducted in this paper with respect to power output and fuel economy. A GT-Suite model of the combined system and a GT-Suite/Simulink co-simulation model are proposed to obtain the optimum operating parameters of the engine and the ORC system under various operating conditions. Furthermore, the effects of the operating parameters, namely, exhaust valve timing, injection timing, expander speed, and pump speed, are evaluated on the combined system. In addition, models of the engine and the ORC system are calibrated, and a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is designed and adopted for global optimization. Optimization results show improvements of 3.24% and 3.13% on the power output and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), respectively, with full engine load when the engine is operated at 3600 r/min. In the optimization of fuel economy with partial engine load, a maximum reduction of 5.71% on the BSFC of the combined system is obtained at 3600 r/min engine speed.

AB A slot-rectangular spouted bed (SRSB) reactor was employed to torrefy spruce-pine-fir sawdust in an oxidative atmosphere. The effects of torrefaction temperature (240-300 degrees C) and feed-gas oxygen concentration (3-9 vol.%) on torrefaction performance and solid product properties were investigated. Adding oxygen in the feed-gas led to more uniform temperature distributions in the SRSB reactor, and was a promising way to achieve stable continuous operation. The mass fraction of cyclone-caught torrefied biomass increased, whereas the mass fraction of torrefied biomass remaining in the reactor decreased, with increasing oxygen concentration and temperature. In oxidative torrefaction, biomass weight loss was 15.4-46.4%, while energy yield was 61.2-99.4%. The effects of oxygen concentration on the weight loss, energy yield and torrefied biomass properties were more significant at 300 degrees C than at 240 degrees C. The torrefied sawdust also had greater HHV and contained less volatiles, more carbon, less oxygen and less hydrogen than the raw biomass.

AB This paper proposes a simple method for estimating annual thermal performance of parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) based on a linear relation with annual DNI for a certain latitude. A case study with simulations for a novel concentrating solar collector in 316 locations for three operating temperature scenarios worldwide was carried out and showed promising results for the latitudes and continents investigated. For a certain latitude and mean operating temperature, the annual yield of a PTC was found to be linearly proportional to yearly DNI. The proposed method will serve as a simplified alternative to the steady-state and quasi-dynamic methods already used. Estimating performance based on yearly DNI can be used by design engineers to do quick preliminary planning of solar plants. Customers can also use this method to evaluate existing solar collector installations. A TRNSYS/TRNSED tool that uses a steady-state model has been developed to carry out the simulations and it has been validated against a PTC array at Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The results show that the simplified method can give reliable estimates of long-term performance of parabolic trough collectors.

AB Egyptian Castor raw oil has been used to produce Castor Methyl Ester (CME) biodiesel utilizing Transesterification-ultrasonic process. To meet the ASTM requirements, CME was blended with the conventional diesel fuel for improving sooting tendency and fuel viscosity. Thermal analysis showed that CME has comparable end-boiling temperature and fuel-air mixing of the diesel fuel. Experiments on a single-cylinder engine in accordance to G-2 of ISO 8718 standard were conducted at wide ranges of blending ratios and operating conditions. Comparing to the neat diesel fuel data, the results of testing CME biodiesel fuel showed that (i) a maximum increase of 8% in the brake specific energy consumptions was received at a blending ratio of 30%, (ii) a slight increase in the brake thermal efficiency (around 1%) was obtained at a blending ratio of 20%, (iii) the best reduction in the carbon monoxide emission (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) were 17%, 40%, and 0.05%, respectively as recorded at a blending ratio of 10%, (iv) the best reduction of 7.5% in carbon dioxide emissions was observed at 20% blending ratio, and (v) the minimum opacity level was observed at a blending ratio of 30%. The results conclude that the 20% blending ratio is recommended to keep high engine efficiency without environmental deterioration.

AB Microalgae cultivation in wastewaters has been identified as the solution for economical microalgae cultivation. This study investigated the feasibility of using POME for Chiorella sp. cultivation to yield biomass and lipids, as it generates massively in Malaysia which ranked world palm oil exporter. The optimal POME concentration and pretreatment strategy were applied to promote biomass and lipid productivities. Chiorella sorokiniana CY-1 attained maximal of 11.21% of lipid content with 2.12 g L-1 of biomass concentration when cultivation in acid-heat pretreated 30% (v/v) POME. This provides relatively higher yield than those reported values on POME. Pretreatment was found effective to enhance biomass productions, as it converts lignin in POME into reducing sugars to serve as the supplement. The pollutants removal efficiencies were 62.07% for TN, 47.09% for COD, and 30.77% for TP. This contributes towards greater feasibility in microalgae cultivation for biofuel productions and as well towards environmental sustainability.

AB In this study, a novel interlaced microchannel with a "cold water-hot water-cold water" counterflow arrangement was designed. The influences of microchannel configurations on the thermal and hydraulic performance were studied by comparing the proposed microchannel configuration with parallel and traditional spiral configurations. The results showed that the effective heat transfer area of the interlaced microchannel was 6.4 and 8.4 times that of the parallel and spiral configurations, respectively. For interlaced microchannels, the maximum temperature difference between the cross sections was 0.07 degrees C, and the temperature rise along the flow direction was only 6 degrees C. When the Reynolds number was 492, the Nusselt number of the interlaced microchannels was 2 and 10 times that of the parallel and spiral microchannels, respectively. The heat transfer performance of interlaced microchannels was improved by 83.46% compared with that in the literature. The influence of microchannel configurations on the pressure drop and the entrance length were negligible. The interlaced microchannel exhibited its lowest thermal resistance of 0.015 degrees C/W and lowest entropy production of 22.6 W/degrees C at a Reynolds number of 492. The heat transfer enhancement coefficient of the interlaced microchannel and parallel microchannel were 5 and 2.8 times that of the traditional spiral microchannel, respectively. The maximum heat load of loop heat pipe was enhanced by 4 times with the integration of interlaced microchannel as the condenser.

AB In integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems, the water-gas shift reaction, which promotes the conversion of CO present in syngas mixtures into hydrogen, is an important step for hydrogen production. Application of the water-gas shift membrane reactor (WGSMR) in IGCC systems is an attractive option for CO2 capture compared with conventional methods because of smaller heat loss in gas purification and high CO conversion by selectively removing hydrogen from the reaction zone through the membrane. In this study, we proposed and evaluated commercial-scale WGSMR models combined with IGCC using reported laboratory-scale experimental data to optimize their operational parameters. Various models were developed using the Aspen Plus (R) Ver. 8.6 process simulator to investigate the impacts of hydrogen separation, pressure loss, and the flow direction between the sweep gas on the permeate side and syngas on the retentate side on the WGSMR performance with respect to CO conversion, H-2 yield, and reactor temperature. The membrane reactor model gave approximately 20% higher CO conversion than a reactor model without H-2 separation and approximately 4% lower CO conversion than a membrane reactor model with a pressure drop. A counter-current membrane reactor model gave approximately 2% higher CO conversion than a co-current model; the H-2 yield on the permeate side was 9.3% higher in the counter-current model by separation of H-2 through the membrane. A sensitivity analysis indicated that a high flow rate and low pressure of sweep gas are advantageous for H-2 recovery, and high catalyst loading and high syngas inlet temperature are preferable for higher CO conversion.

AB Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) powered by solar energy is an attractive solution to mitigate freshwater supply problems. This paper presents an investigation on performance and cost of a 111 MWe solar power tower (SPT) plant integrated with DCMD system. The SPT plant comprised of an evaporative cooling with seawater as cooling agent in the condenser. Additionally, warm seawater leaving the condenser was introduced into DCMD system as feed water. For SPT plant, simulations revealed that an increment in incident solar power enhanced the electricity production and consequently the cooling water requirements. Annual gross electric output and cooling water requirements were estimated to be 493.8 GWh and 1,422,364 m(3), respectively. Whereas the energy cost was estimated to be 13.03 cents per kWh. Furthermore, a mathematical model was developed and solved for evaluating the DCMD system. The model was validated by means of the experimental data. In DCMD system, permeate flux and evaporation efficiency increased when feed water temperature was increased. However, specific thermal energy consumption decreased with an increase in feed water temperature. The average freshwater production by the proposed system was estimated up to 40,759 L/day with a cost of $0.392/m(3).

AB In this study, the effects of inorganic (HCl, HNO3 and H2SO4) and organic (HCOOH, CH3COOH and HOOCC-OOH) acid pretreatments on the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of municipal secondary sludge (MSS) were investigated. The results showed that all acid pretreatments could increase bio-oil yield by changing the proportion of organic matters and ash content in feedstock and thus facilitating the conversion of water soluble product to bio-oil. A maximum bio-oil yield of 26.75 wt% was obtained from the HCl pretreatment which increased 7.5 wt% compared to the blank experiment. Moreover, the inorganic acid pretreatments showed a better performance in terms of enhancing bio-oil quality as their higher heating values (HHVs, 31.83-36.04 MJ/kg) were much higher than that from organic acid pretreatments (24.57-29.22 MJ/kg). The characterization analysis of bio-oil indicated that the HCl pretreatment was most beneficial for the formation of light fraction and increment of hydrocarbon.

AB The CO2 transcritical Rankine cycle has considerable potential for the waste heat recovery of engine, but its high operation pressure, harsh condensation condition and low thermodynamic performance are huge obstacle restricting the wide application of it. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance improvements of transcritical Rankine cycle using CO2 mixtures for the waste heat recovery of engine. A large number of refrigerants are discussed and then eight of them are selected as the candidate additives into CO2. The Peng-Robinson equations of states are applied to calculate the properties of CO2 mixtures in this study. Afterwards, thermodynamic, economic and miniaturization analyses are implemented. The results show that CO2 mixtures can enlarge the condensation temperature range of the transcritical Rankine cycle and the high operation pressure will also be improved. Moreover, based on transcritical Rankine cycle with optimal power output, CO2/R32 (0.3/0.7) performed best when the condensation temperature is lower than 40 degrees C, else the CO2/R161 (0.45/0.55) is a suitable selection among the CO2 mixtures. The optimal operation pressure will reduce by 36% and 35% respectively for the transcritical Rankine cycles with CO(2/)R161 (0.45/0.55) and CO2/R32 (0.3/0.7) compared with the CO2 transcritical Rankine cycle. Based on transcritical Rankine cycle with optimal total heat transfer area, the CO2/R32 (0.7/0.3) is the best selection. The optimal operation pressure of transcritical Rankine cycle with CO2/R32 (0.7/0.3) decreases by 1.4 MPa and net output power increases by 8.8% compared with CO(2)transcritical Rankine cycle. The optimal total heat transfer area increment of CO2/R32 (0.7/0.3) will decrease by 29.4% compared with that of CO2/R32 (0.3/0.7).

AB This study presents a 3-dimensional numerical simulation of a flat-plate photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) hybrid system using a nanofluid as the solar spectrum filter. A series of parametric studies have been carried out to investigate the module performance by employing different base fluid (water, therminol VP-1 and propylene glycol) - nanoparticle (Ag, Fe3O4 and SiO2) combinations. The present work explores the effects of different nanoparticle concentrations, volume flow rates of applied nanofluids, as well as the solar spectrum intensities on the energetic and exergetic performances of the proposed module. Merit functions for various basefluid or nanofluid based hybrid PV/T systems are also assessed in order to determine their economic feasibility. The results show that the suspension of nanoparticles into basefluids has a considerable influence on the radiative heat fluxes that are absorbed by each component of such system. The selection of basefluid-nanoparticle combination is dramatically affected by the desired energy form, based on the system energetic and exergetic performances. Besides, both the system energy and exergy efficiencies are improved with the increment of solar irradiance, whereas they have a counter tendency by increasing the volume flow rate of working fluid. The employment of liquid absorptive filters in such systems can realize a higher energy output which is 179%-240% of that of a stand-alone PV system.

AB This paper proposed a novel combined system to achieve the cascade utilization of geothermal energy for joint power and water production. A regenerative organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is adopted as the top cycle, while a desalination system based on humidification dehumidification (HDH) principle with open-air architectures is applied to further utilize the geothermal energy. Based on the streams within the ORC and HDH units, the corresponding mathematical models with mass and energy conservation are established, and performance simulation according to thermodynamic laws is fulfilled. Furthermore, cost analysis of the combined system is also accomplished to reveal the correlations between the system economy and the involved parameters. The research results show that the actual peak values of net power, water production and gained-output-ratio (GOR) reach 42.68 kW, 236.81 kg H-1 and 1.42, and the total efficiency of the entire system is 31.19%. Based on the obtained thermodynamic performance, the bottom cost of the entire system is found as 4983.83$ with a total heat and mass transfer areas of 104.27 m(2) at the balance condition of the humidifier. Furthermore, according to the influence analysis, an elevation of the evaporation temperature of the ORC, which is within the prescribed range, is beneficial to improve the thermodynamic performance and the relevant cost of the combined system.

AB In this work cyclic variability is examined in a methane-fueled spark-ignition (SI) engine. A new numerical approach is developed and integrated into the ignition model of an in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, with the aim to estimate the effect of this highly-complex phenomenon in engines. This sub-model focuses on small-scale turbulence, with its main feature concerning the prediction of the flame propagation once the relative position of the initial flamelet and the local turbulent eddy is defined. This is accomplished by using a blending of the laminar and turbulent flame speeds at the spark cell, according to the flame surface that lies outside the local eddy, smoothing the transition from the laminar to turbulent combustion regimes. A methodology for estimating the coefficient of variation (COV) of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) is then proposed based on the simulation of a large number of closed engine cycles. A validated CFD code including this sub-model is applied for the cyclic variability estimation of a SI engine fueled with methane, for which a complete set of measured data is available. The numerical results are then compared with the measured data, focusing on the minimum and maximum peak pressure and IMEP. The final result is the calculation of the COV of IMEP, once the COV value of the multi-cycle simulations converges according to the criteria selected. Overall, the numerical results are close to the measured data with a relative difference of COV of IMEP about 25%, showing that the developed code can be used to estimate, at least qualitatively, the main parameters of cyclic variability in engines, with the intention to introduce in a next version more mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon. The ultimate goal is then to direct attention to the effects of different fuels on the cyclic variations and the associated pollutant emissions.

AB Reactivity controlled compression ignition has been introduced to implement controllable, clean, and high thermal efficiency without undermining the advantages of premixed combustion. However, simultaneous auto-ignition introduced by reactivity controlled combustion challenges the combustion under higher load operations. This experimental study incorporates a dual phase heat release concept with the purpose of improving the performance of reactivity controlled compression ignition engine. Different ratios of ethanol/diethyl-ether blends (from 0% to 40% diethyl ether and 70% premixed ratio) were applied to a light duty diesel engine at various combustion timings and engine loads. The diesel fuel was directly injected into the combustion chamber while ethanol/diethyl-ether blends were injected in the intake port. Engine performance and exhaust emissions were compared between the baseline operation and high blend ratios. An addition of 40% diethyl ether in the ethanol approximately resulted in 14% increase of the indicated mean effective pressure and 33% reduction in maximum pressure rise rate. The high reactivity of diethyl ether enhanced the oxidation of the hydrocarbons and resulted in lower hydrocarbon emissions. The higher volatility and better overall fuel-air mixing improved the combustion and reduced particle emission. Stable combustion was expanded at high load operating conditions due to double-stage heat release enhancement.

AB This paper summarizes the results of a study aimed at using isobutane, butane, isopentane and pentane as working fluid of an organic Rankine cycle utilizing heat of an air cooler. Ranking of different working fluids based on the maximum achievable power output, cycle efficiency, heat recovery, required heat exchanger area, attainable CO2 emission reduction, and payback period was performed. By applying pure components, the extractable turbine power varied in the range of 452-678 kW and the CO2 emission reduction potential was in the range of 723-1085 t/y in which isobutane provided the best results. Economic calculation involving both the capital and operating expenditures was conducted, which showed that the estimated payback periods were between 3.4 and 4.6 years with the best result of butane. The results of calculations that were obtained by using working fluids composed from pairs of light hydrocarbons showed that the extractable turbine power was higher for mixtures of butanes than those for butanes/pentanes and pentane mixtures. Based on the payback period, the hydrocarbon mixtures were composed from isobutane/butane in 25:75 and 50:50, and butane/pentane in 75:25 mass ratios that can be applied as favourable working fluids.

AB A novel hybrid system fueled with natural gas (NG), consisting of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and gas processing (GP) subsystem for H-2 production and purification, is proposed and modeled in this paper. The combination of water gas shift (WGS) and thermal swing adsorption (TSA) methods is adopted to convert the syngas from the SOFC into H-2 with high purity for subsequent use as a fuel in PEMFC for additional power generation. The parametric and exergy analyses show that the proposed hybrid system can achieve high energy conversion efficiency of approximately 64% and exergy efficiency of 61%, which are higher than some other fuel cell systems, such as reformer-PEMFC, standalone SOFC, SOFC-engine/gas turbine and SOFC-chemical looping hydrogen production. The waste heat recovery for driving the TSA reaction and the H-2 recirculation for the PEMFC are found to improve the net electricity efficiency by 3.24% and 6.33%, respectively. In addition, using TSA method instead of the traditional pressure swing adsorption (PSA) could improve the efficiency of the SOFC-PEMFC hybrid system without increasing the exergy destruction. These results reveal that the novel hybrid system is a promising energy conversion system with high efficiency.

AB In the scenario of the small scale 3-35 kWe concentrated solar power plant based on point receiver technologies; the dish-Stirling configuration is one of the most commonly adopted one. New and clean efficiency of these Stirling engines is typically of 30-40%. Yearly average efficiency, during the system operations, is significantly reduced to 10-15% due to the Stirling engines high maintenance costs and poor reliability issues. These drawbacks limit the small scale dish-Stirling engines market attractiveness. The adoption of cheap, reliable and widely available engines, such as micro gas turbines is a promising solution for substituting Stirling engines since it ensures constant performance over time. Since micro gas turbines for concentrated solar power plant: equipped with dish concentrator have not been widely deployed, the development of a plant simulator is helpful for predicting the overall concentrated solar power plant performance and for optimizing the plant operation: under different boundary conditions. The plant simulator is aimed to demonstrate the economic viability and the technical feasibility of dish - micro gas turbine systems.
   The paper includes the methods for developing a simulation tool for solar dish- micro gas turbine applications.. The solar concentrator, receiver/absorber, micro gas turbine, high speed generator and power electronic systems have been modelled and the plant simulator has been set-up by means of a quadratic programming technique. The simulator has been used to perform steady state simulations for predicting the performance and for ensuring a safe and reliable power plant operation when the direct normal irradiation changes. The results for a net generated power of about 6 kWe have shown a nominal peak efficiency of about 10%, making this micrc gas turbine solar plant layout market attractive.

AB Brown seaweed may be an option as a feedstock for gaseous biofuel production. This paper proposed a detailed study on the impacts of various segments of seaweed thalli on the biomethane production. Ascophyllum nodosum, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria hyperborea, Saccharina latissima and Saccorhiza polyschides have shown significant variation in proximate, ultimate and biochemical composition in various segments of their thalli. The highest biomethane potential of 286 L CH4 kg VS-1 was recorded from the stipe of L. digitata, whereas the lowest value of 118 L CH4 kg VS-1 was obtained from the holdfast of L. hyperborean. Due to the accumulated salt in the holdfast, the biomethane performance was reduced compared with the frond and stipe. The specific yield per fresh weight of seaweed was measured in the range of 10 to 32 m(3) CH4 t(wwt)(-1). Considering the dominant role of fresh thallus, the frond was the most significant part for seaweed biogas production.

AB An estimated 16% of the world's population do not have access to electricity, and most of them live in rural areas. A reliable energy access for rural communities will help them break out of the cycle of poverty and will empower significant socio-economic benefits. Specifically, the energy sector situation in Palestine suffers from scarcity of traditional energy sources, financial crisis and unstable political conditions. Meanwhile, Palestine has high solar energy potential and an annual average solar radiation of about 5.4 kWh/m(2) day. This article provides a solution by designing a solar home system represented by a small, lightweight, decentralized and autonomous generation with a combination of four different electric appliances to cover several basic needs. The design is assessed by using the product design knowledge as this publication presents an overview of the approach used in structuring and using product design tools leading to shape formulation of system which is called SolenX. The paper also examines a business model that creates a heuristic logic to connect technical potential with the realization of economic value while addressing the total estimated manufacturing cost of $416 per unit. SolenX is powered by a 60 W foldable solar panel with a battery capacity of 0.480 kWh.

AB With the increasing access for distributed energy and the enlarging demand for energy utilization, considering the difference of the electric/heating/cooling energy flow in multi-energy complementary park and the uncertainty of the distributed energy output, an evaluation method of the energy supply system in multi-energy complementary park based on the improved universal generating function (UGF) method is proposed. In this method, the constraints of the startup and shutdown and the climbing of conventional energy supply units are taking into account, and a timing UGF model of each energy supply unit in multi-energy complementary park which contains the wind turbine, photovoltaic, conventional unit, micro gas turbine, gas boiler and energy storage device is established. What's more, considering the reliability, economy and electrothermal coupling characteristics of the energy supply system, an evaluation index system of the energy supply system in multi-energy complementary park is built. Finally, the correctness and feasibility of the proposed evaluation method are verified through the typical IEEE-RTS79 system. In addition, taking a multi-energy complementary park in northern China as an example, the probabilistic production simulation (PPS) and sensitivity analysis for typical scenarios to achieve the overall evaluation of the energy supply system in the multi-energy complementary park are carried out.

AB At present, geothermal energy is a promising research area but with a series of unknowns waited to be explored. Recently, the U-shaped closed loop geothermal extraction system was proposed to improve the geothermal recovery performance. However, there is a lack of mathematical model to simulate the circulating process of CO2 in the wellbore. In this paper, a model is developed for simulating CO2 flow in the descending, horizontal and ascending sections of the geothermal well. Besides, in order to properly evaluate the geothermal recovery performance, two new concepts of critical position and effective distance are proposed. Simulation results show that: (a) There exists a critical position in the ascending wellbore where the working fluid temperature is equal to the formation temperature. (b) The effect of mass flow rate on pressure drop becomes more obvious when the gravity is neglected, especially under the condition that the mass flow is at a higher value. (c) The rapid increase of working fluid temperature does not mean that the geothermal recovery performance is better. At this time, the effective distance should be adopted as an additional reference.

AB Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has been considered as one of the promising renewable power technologies for the vehicular application. This paper proposes a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) power system model that can be implemented in the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) emulation for real-time execution on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The FCEV model comprises three parts: a PEMFC, a Z-source inverter and a squirrel cage motor. To achieve an accurate and efficient FPGA resources' utilization, the PEMFC model is implemented by CPU whereas the models of the DC-AC inverter and the electrical motor are built in FPGA. For the validation of the proposed power system, the real-time simulation tests are conducted with a high accuracy. The developed hybrid system model can reach a simulation time step of 100 ns for FPGA and 500 mu s for CPU under the co-simulation mode. Moreover, the simulation under various system operating conditions indicates that the high performance can be reached by the hybrid system computed in real-time. The proposed real-time model can be used to design the on-line diagnostic and model predictive control method, which can help to test the FCEV before the commercial applications.

AB Self-sustaining systems are considered by researchers, policy makers and investors to be one of the most interesting technologies in the world. The proportion of energy being derived from biological sources is increasing due to processes for converting wood biomass. In rural areas in Europe, bioenergy can effectively alleviate energy dependence on external energy resources for green energy development. An applied bioenergy study was conducted in Ezcaray, Spain, a forested village representative of rural areas in cold climate zones in southern Europe. The present study aims to evaluate and use existing forest resources and assess their thermal potentiality and replicability in remote areas via self-sustaining systems for distributed thermal production. Knowledge gaps and technology options for assessing and meeting sustainability criteria are analyzed. The implemented methodology considers a combination of mass, energy and costs from the source to the bioenergy heating system, and it assesses the techno-economic feasibility of such systems against boilers using different fuels. Two proposals were studied, namely, starting a pellet mill for the thermal system market and replacing existing boilers with biomass in self-sustaining systems. The first proposal is profitable, with a selling price equal to or higher than 146.04 (sic)/t. In the second proposal, the non-renewable primary energy consumption in the studied households was between 13- and 15-times higher with fossil fuel boilers than with biomass boilers. In both cases, thermal systems in rural areas may effectively alleviate dependence on non-renewable energy to increase green energy use in Europe by 2020.

AB The objective of this project was to develop a novel phosphorus removal system using steel slag filters applicable in decentralized applications and to propose design criteria about maintenance needs. Slag exhaustion functions were measured on 2-3 mm, 3-5 mm, 5-10 mm and 16-23 mm slag. Three steel slag columns with particle size of 2-3 mm, 3-5 mm and 5-10 mm were fed with the effluent of an aerated lagoon during 589 days. A barrel reactor test was fed during 365 days with the effluent of an attached growth aerated biological reactor. The o-PO4 concentration at the effluent of the 2-3 mm and 3 5 mm columns and barrel reactor test was between 0.04 and 03 mg P/L. Particulate phosphorus, however, was removed by about 50%. The P-Hydroslag model implemented in PHREEQC was successfully calibrated with data from the column test, and validated with data from the barrel reactor test. The calibrated model was used to simulate long-term operation of a slag barrel reactor with two parallel streams of five replaceable steel slag barrels, with total hydraulic retention time of voids of 15 h. The system longevity was strongly influenced by the influent alkalinity. The simulated longevity was 7 years with an influent alkalinity of 50 mg CaCO3/L and 2 years with an influent of 210 mg CaCO3/L The alkalinity of the steel slag filter influent was influenced by the type of aquifer supplying drinking water, the presence of nitrification activity and by the CO2 concentration in the enriched air of the upstream biological process. Simulated scenarios with partial barrel replacement (e.g. barrels 1 and 2 out of 5 replaced at frequency of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 or 4 years) increased the system longevity up to 14 years while slightly increasing the number of barrels needed.

AB Quinone group is an important fraction of humic acid. The pseudo-first-order rate constant (k(obs)) of levofloxacin (LF) degradation by permanganate (MnO4-) significantly increased from 0.010 (without benzoquinone, BQ) to 0.042-0.443 min(-1) at [BQ](0):MnO4-](0) (molar ratio) = 0.03-0.25 at pH 7.5, and an acidic pH facilitated LF degradation. In the presence of BQ MnO4- was first reduced to Mn(II). Then, Mn(II) reacted with BQ to produce Mn(III) and semiquinone radical, which was promoted under acidic conditions. With dissolved oxygen available, Mn(III) further oxidized semiquinone radical to produce singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)) as well as regenerate BQ In addition, MnO4- could also react with Mn(II) to produce Mn(III), whose complexation with semiquinone radical in turn promoted this reaction. Due to the predominant scavenging of O-2(center dot-) by BQ O-1(2) and Mn(III) mainly contributed to the accelerated LF degradation, with a notable formation of hydroxyl, ketone and endoperoxide groups in the degradation byproducts. This study helps better understand the role of natural organic matter in the degradation of organic micropollutants by MnO4- in water treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many of the small drinking water systems in the US that utilize simple filtration and chlorine disinfection or chlorine disinfection alone are facing disinfection byproduct (DBP) noncompliance issues, which need immediate upgrades. In this study, four potential upgrade scenarios, namely the GAC, ozone, UV30, and UV186 scenarios, were designed for a typical small drinking water systems and compared in terms of embodied energy, carbon footprint, and life cycle cost. These scenarios are designed to either reduce the amount of DBP precursors using granular activated carbon filtration (the GAC scenario) or ozonation (the ozone scenario), or replace the chlorine disinfection with the UV disinfection at different intensities followed by chloramination (the UV30 and UV186 scenarios). The UV30 scenario was found to have the lowest embodied energy (417 GJ/year) and life cycle cost ($0.25 million US dollars), while the GAC scenario has the lowest carbon footprint (21 Mg CO(2)e/year). The UV186 scenario consistently presents the highest environmental and economic impacts. The major contributors of the economic and environmental impacts of individual scenarios also differ. Energy and/or material consumptions during the operation phase dominate the environmental impacts of the four scenarios, while the infrastructure investments have a noticeable contribution to the economic costs. The results are sensitive to changes in water quality. An increase of raw water quality, i.e., an increase in organic precursor content, could potentially result in the ozone scenario being the least energy intensive scenario, while a decrease of water quality could greatly reduce the overall competitiveness of the GAC scenario.

AB Water quality security within water distribution systems (WDSs) has been an important issue due to their inherent vulnerability associated with contamination intrusion. This motivates intensive studies to identify optimal water quality sensor placement (WQSP) strategies, aimed to timely/effectively detect (un)intentional intrusion events. However, these available WQSP optimization methods have consistently presumed that each WDS node has an equal contamination probability. While being simple in implementation, this assumption may do not conform to the fact that the nodal contamination probability may be significantly regionally varied owing to variations in population density and user properties. Furthermore, the low computational efficiency is another important factor that has seriously hampered the practical applications of the currently available WQSP optimization approaches. To address these two issues, this paper proposes an efficient multi-objective WQSP optimization method to explicitly account for contamination probability variations. Four different contamination probability functions (CPFs) are proposed to represent the potential variations of nodal contamination probabilities within the WDS. Two real-world WDSs are used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. Results show that WQSP strategies can be significantly affected by the choice of the CPF. For example, when the proposed method is applied to the large case study with the CPF accounting for user properties, the event detection probabilities of the resultant solutions are approximately 65%, while these values are around 25% for the traditional approach, and such design solutions are achieved approximately 10,000 times faster than the traditional method. This paper provides an alternative method to identify optimal WQSP solutions for the WDS, and also builds knowledge regarding the impacts of different CPFs on sensor deployments.

AB Anaerobic treatment of sedimented fibers collected from bottom of a bay that had been receiving pulp and paper mill wastewater for about 70 years were studied for the first time in semi-continuously fed continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Anaerobic treatment of the fiber sediment was shown to be feasible, without dilution and with nitrogen and buffer supplement, at organic loading rates (OLR) up to 2.5 kg VS/m(3)d and hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 60 d resulting in methane yields of 201 +/- 18 L CH4/kg VS. Co-digestion of sedimented fiber with sewage sludge at an OLR of 1.5 kg VS/m(3)d and HRT of 20 d resulted in a methane production of 246 +/- 10 L CH4/kg VS. The techno-economic feasibility of mono and co-digestion process together with several case dependent factors such as maximum operable OLR, digestate utilization needs to be evaluated before making further conclusions for larger scale remediation applications.

AB Optimization-based deployment of contamination warning system in water distribution systems has been widely used in the literature, due to their superior performance compared to rule- and opinion based approaches. However, optimization techniques impose an excessive computational burden, which in turn is compensated for by shrinking the problem's decision space and/or using faster optimization algorithms with less accuracy. This imposes subjectivity in interpretation of the system and associated risks, and undermines model's accuracy by not exploring the entire feasible space. We propose a framework that uses information theoretic techniques, including value of information and transinformation entropy, for optimal sensor placement. This can be used either as pre-selection, i.e. pinpointing best potential locations of sensors to be in turn used in optimization framework, or ultimate selection, i.e. single-handedly selecting sensor locations from the feasible space. The proposed framework is then applied to Lamerd water distribution system, in Fars province, Iran, and the results are compared to the suggested potential locations of sensors in previous studies and results of TEVA-SPOT model. The proposed information theoretic scheme enhances the decision space, provides more accurate results, significantly reduces the computational burden, and warrants objective selection of sensor placement.

AB Faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) are major pollutants in many catchments world-wide, with streamside pastures on livestock farms being potentially significant sources. Hitherto, few empirical studies have quantified FIO fluxes from such areas or investigated streambank fencing (SBF) and other possible mitigation measures. The aim of this two-phase (before/after intervention) study of the effectiveness of SBF was to generate an empirical evidence-base to enable regulatory authorities to make better-informed decisions concerning the implementation of this measure. It was undertaken during the summer bathing season along a 271 m stream reach in the River Tamar catchment, SW England. The study included: cattle distribution surveys; monitoring of changes in E. coli (EC) and intestinal enterococci (IE) concentrations and fluxes down the reach and of concentrations in ditch flow and surface runoff; phage tracer studies of surface runoff from pasture land; and experimental streambed trampling to investigate streambed FIO sources. The results show that cattle spend a disproportionately large amount of time in the watercourse/riparian zone along unfenced streams; identify direct defecation to the stream by wading livestock and the release/mobilisation of FIOs from cowpats by surface runoff from the adjacent pastures at times of high flow as key transmission routes; and demonstrate that FIOs become incorporated within streambed sediments, from which they may subsequently be released by trampling. Partial exclusion of cattle through SBF with a drinking bay greatly reduces the time cattle spend in streams. Total exclusion SBF, with provision of an alternative drinking supply, considerably reduces FIO load inputs to the stream reach, e.g. at times of high flow, which are critical in terms of pollutant fluxes to coastal waters, the mean EC and IE input loads to the reach fell by 0.842 and 2.206 log(10), respectively.

AB Treatment of sewage sludge with a thermal hydrolysis process (THP) followed by anaerobic digestion (AD) enables to boost biogas production and minimize residual sludge volumes. However, the reject water can cause inhibition to aerobic and anoxic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB & AnAOB), the two key microbial groups involved in the deammonification process. Firstly, a detailed investigation elucidated the impact of different organic fractions present in THP-AD return liquor on AerAOB and AnAOB activity. For AnAOB, soluble compounds linked to THP conditions and AD performance caused the main inhibition. Direct inhibition by dissolved organics was also observed for AerAOB, but could be overcome by treating the filtrate with extended aerobic or anaerobic incubation or with activated carbon. AerAOB additionally suffered from particulate and colloidal organics limiting the diffusion of substrates. This was resolved by improving the dewatering process through an optimized flocculant polymer dose and/or addition of coagulant polymer to better capture the large colloidal fraction, especially in case of unstable AD performance. Secondly, a new inhibition model for AerAOB included diffusion-limiting compounds based on the porter-equation, and achieved the best fit with the experimental data, highlighting that AerAOB were highly sensitive to large colloids. Overall, this paper for the first time provides separate identification of organic fractions within THP-AD filtrate causing differential types of inhibition. Moreover, it highlights the combined effect of the performance of THP, AD and dewatering on the downstream autotrophic nitrogen removal kinetics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The advantages of polychromatic ultraviolet (UV) light for viral disinfection can be optimized for disinfection using emerging tailored wavelength sources including KrCl excimer lamps and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Disinfection of the common viral surrogate MS2 bacteriophage was measured after exposure to these emerging sources and conventional low pressure (LP) mercury UV lamps in individual or sequential exposures. The first dose response for any virus (MS2) exposed to a KrCl excimer lamp is reported, showing the high efficiency of fluence-based disinfection because of increased viral susceptibility at the low wavelengths emitted by the excilamp. Sequential exposure dose responses indicated synergy from sequential exposures of LP and excimer lamps, which were competitive on an electrical basis at worst-and best-case scenarios of wall plug efficiency with current medium pressure (MP) disinfection. Best-case scenarios for electrical efficiency also showed all sequential exposures to be competitive with MP UV disinfection. Predictive models for sequential exposure dose responses were assessed to support the current feasibility of incorporating sequential UV exposures to optimize tailored wavelength viral disinfection.

AB For ensuring microbial safety, the current European bathing water directive (BWD) (76/160/EEC 2006) demands the implementation of reliable early warning systems for bathing waters, which are known to be subject to short-term pollution. However, the BWD does not provide clearly defined threshold levels above which an early warning system should start warning or informing the population. Statistical regression modelling is a commonly used method for predicting concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria. The present study proposes a methodology for implementing early warning systems based on multivariate regression modelling, which takes into account the probabilistic character of European bathing water legislation for both alert levels and model validation criteria. Our study derives the methodology, demonstrates its implementation based on information and data collected at a river bathing site in Berlin, Germany, and evaluates health impacts as well as methodological aspects in comparison to the current way of long-term classification as outlined in the BWD.

AB When aluminum salts are added to water at around neutral pH, a precipitate of Al hydroxide is formed very rapidly. Initially the precipitate is in the form of nano-scale primary particles, which then aggregate to form flocs. The nature of the flocs depends greatly on the solution composition, for instance on the presence of humic acid (HA), which not only increases the size of the primary nanoparticles, but also decreases the connection points between them. The nanoparticles become smaller with aging, both with and without HA, as a result of crystallization. The aggregated amorphous nanoparticles (settled flocs) undergo a room temperature structural modification best characterized as a disorder-to-order transition, following elimination of water. During this process, the apparent Al concentration in the supernatant of water increases with age. The "dissolved Al" concentration in the supernatant becomes higher with increasing pH and, to some extent, in the presence of HA. However, it can be shown that the "dissolved Al" in the supernatant exists in the form of crystalline nano-particles or larger clusters, which are detached from the settled flocs. TEM results confirmed that HA only adsorbed on the surface of nano particles during the coagulation process, which shows precipitate nanoparticles formed firstly during sweep coagulation before the adsorption of HA or complexed Al3+-HA. However, the adsorbed outer layer of HA does not change the crystallization process for the inner part of nano-particles.
   This laboratory study may have implications for the release of Al from sediments into lake water, following addition of coagulants to lower phosphorus concentrations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Resilience has been increasingly pursued in the management of water distribution systems (WDSs) such that a system can adapt to and rapidly recover from potential failures in face of a deep uncertain and unpredictable future. Topology has been assumed to have a great impact on resilience of WDSs, and is the basis of many studies on assessing and building resilience. However, this fundamental assumption has not been justified and requires investigation. To address this, a novel framework for mapping between resilience performance and network topological attributes is proposed. It is applied to WDSs here but can be adaptable to other network systems. In the framework, resilience is comprehensively assessed using stress-strain tests which measure system performance on six metrics corresponding to system resistance, absorption and restoration capacities. Six key topological attributes of WDSs (connectivity, efficiency, centrality, diversity, robustness and modularity) are studied by mathematical abstraction of WDSs as graphs and measured by eight statistical metrics in graph theory. The interplay between resilience and topological attributes is revealed by the correlations between their corresponding metrics, based on 85 WDSs with different sizes and topological features. Further, network variants from a single WDS are generated to uncover the value of topological attribute metrics in guiding the extension/rehabilitation design of WDSs towards resilience. Results show that only certain aspects of resilience performance, i.e. spatial and temporal scales of failure impacts, are strongly influenced by some (not all) topological attributes, i.e. network connectivity, efficiency, modularity and centrality. Metrics for describing the topological attributes of WDSs need to be carefully selected; for example, clustering coefficient is found to be weakly correlated with resilience performance compared to other metrics of network connectivity (due to the grid-like structures of WDSs). Topological attribute metrics alone are not sufficient to guide the design of resilient WDSs and key details such as the location of water sources also need to be considered. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Sanitation systems based on source separation and valorisation of human urine can improve the environmental sustainability of wastewater management. Yet, the social acceptability of such new, resource oriented sanitation practices have not been assessed systematically. We attempt to address this research gap by reporting the findings of a survey conducted at a South Indian university that evaluated support for urine recycling among 1252 Indian consumers. We place our findings in the context of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, quantify consumer attitude to urine recycling through an exploratory numerical approach, and identify explanatory factors that shape consumer beliefs and perceptions. Overall, a moderately positive attitude was observed: 68% stated human urine should not be disposed but recycled, 55% considered it as fertiliser, but only 44% would consume food grown using it. While 65% believed using urine as crop fertiliser could pose a health risk, majority (80%) believed it could be treated so as to not pose a risk. The respondents' willingness to consume' urine-fertilised food was found to be strongly influenced by their willingness to pay. Consumer environmental attitudes, as evaluated using the New Ecological Paradigm scale, did not influence their attitude towards urine recycling behaviour. We thus believe that simply appealing to people's environmental sensitivities is not enough for introducing environmentally-friendly technologies like urine recycling, but that more targeted marketing messages are needed. We find sufficient support among our surveyed consumers for urine recycling but highlight that further research is needed to identify what information and agency will help translate positive attitudes into action and behaviour.

AB Exponential wash-off models are the most widely used method to predict sediment wash-off from urban surfaces. In spite of many studies, there is still a lack of knowledge on the effect of external drivers such as rainfall intensity and surface slope on wash-off predictions. In this study, a more physically realistic "structure" is added to the original exponential wash-off model (OEM) by replacing the invariant parameters with functions of rainfall intensity and catchment surface slope, so that the model can better represent catchment and rainfall conditions without the need for lookup tables and interpolation/extrapolation. In the proposed new exponential model (NEM), two such functions are introduced. One function describes the maximum fraction of the initial load that can be washed off by a rainfall event for a given slope and the other function describes the wash-off rate during a rainfall event for a given slope. The parameters of these functions are estimated using data collected from a series of laboratory experiments carried out using an artificial rainfall generator, a 1 m(2) bituminous road surface and a continuous wash-off measuring system. These experimental data contain high temporal resolution measurements of wash-off fractions for combinations of five rainfall intensities ranging from 33 to 155 mm/h and three catchment slopes ranging from 2 to 8%. Bayesian inference, which allows the incorporation of prior knowledge, is implemented to estimate parameter values. Explicitly accounting for model bias and measurement errors, a likelihood function representative of the wash-off process is formulated, and the uncertainty in the prediction of the NEM is quantified. The results of this study show: 1) even when the OEM is calibrated for every experimental condition, the NEM's performance, with parameter values defined by functions, is comparable to the OEM. 2) Verification indices for estimates of uncertainty associated with the NEM suggest that the error model used in this study is able to capture the uncertainty well.

AB Investments for upgrading wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with tertiary treatment to reduce microcontaminant loads in surface waters at a catchment scale can be daunting. These investments are highly sensitive to the selection of environmental quality standards (EQSs) for the target micro-contaminants. Our hypothesis is that there is a balance between EQS selection and investment that needs to be considered in decision-making. We used a customized microcontaminant fate and transport model coupled to an optimization algorithm to validate this hypothesis in the Llobregat river basin and for the pharmaceutical compound diclofenac. The algorithm optimizes the number of WWTPs in this catchment requiring an upgrade to minimize the total amount of diclofenac that exceeds the EQS in every river section and the total cost. We simulated and optimized 40 scenarios representing a combination of 4 potential EQSs (10, 30, 50 and 100 ng L-1), 5 levels of uncertainty bounds in the predictions of river concentrations and 2 hydrological scenarios (average flows, flows annually exceeding 30% of the days; and environmental flows, flows annually exceeding 99% of the days). The results showthat there is a nonlinear relationship between the EQS and the required investment. The investment increases by 100% from an EQS of 100 ng L-1 to 10 ng L-1, significantly increasing (by 60%) from 30 to 10 ng L-1. Thus, establishing an EQS of 30 ng L-1 would balance environmental protection and costs. The selection of the hydrological conditions also plays a key role in the upgrade analysis because the costs for environmental flows are 50% higher than for average flows. Finally, we highlight that the investment in research would allow the reduction of uncertainties, hence allowing more qualified decisions to be made and a reduction in the WWTP upgrade costs (up to 4 (sic) household(-1) "year(-1)).

AB Geopolymers are a new class of non-Portland cements produced using an alumino-silicate material and an activating solution, which is mainly composed of sodium or potassium and waterglass to be subsequently cured at relatively low temperatures. Those can be formulated by adding natural minerals, waste and/or industrial by-products. The study investigates the microstructural properties of geopolymers synthesized from metakaolin (MK) and the admixture of fly ash (FBA) and aluminium industry slags (AIS) at different ages of curing. Five different geopolymer compositions were prepared and characterized by XRD, ATR-FTIR and SEM/EDS. The study revealed that geopolymeric gels are identified, which show mainly glassy microstructures, in agreement with the X-ray amorphous diffraction patterns, broad FTIR features and confirmed by SEM/EDS, with promising results prior to an industrial scale.

AB Fly ash is a biomass combustion by-product produced by dragging ash from the base of the furnace. Disposing of ash is a growing economic and environmental burden. Based on physical and chemical properties, fly ash could be used in the manufacture of construction materials. This paper investigates the influence of biomass fly ash from olive pomace as additive to manufacture of clay ceramic composite materials. Fired clay brick at 950 degrees C were prepared containing between 0 and 25 wt% fly ash. Final products are studied by water absorption, bulk density, loss of ignition, linear shrinkage, compressive strength and physisorption N-2. The results reveal that the porosity of the materials increases with the level of fly ash replacement (10% up to 25 wt%) resulting in to increased water absorption and decreased compressive strength. Fired clay brick developed in this study can be used for construction materials based on criteria of the current regulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption is an effective method for phosphorus removal from eutrophic waters. Phosphorus adsorption is affected by various factors, such as the nature of the adsorbent, the characteristics of the raw water, etc. This study investigated the effect of alum sludge chemical components on adsorption capacity and the forms of P retained in alum sludge. Results showed that alum sludge can be used as a good candidate material for P adsorption, and components of Al, Ca and initial concentration of P had a significant effect on P adsorption. All the sampled sludges had high P adsorption capacity ranging from 2.06 to 6.06 mg P g(-1) sludge. Derived from four different water treatment plants in Shandong province, Yu Qing alum sludge had the largest P adsorption capacity (6.06 mg P g(-1)), followed by Xue Shan and Que Hua, while San He sludge had the least. Sequential P extraction test indicated that most of the P forms stored in the sludges are in the inorganic forms, and the relative proportion illustrated that most of the P fractions bound to Ca (AP) and P-Al, Fe (NAIP) in all samples. Utilization of alum sludge as P adsorbent has become a win-win technology for water treatment and waste management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, the wetting behavior of molten calcium-magnesium-aluminum-silicate (CMAS) on femtosecond laser ablated YSZ coatings is comparatively studied. The results suggest that femtosecond laser ablated coating possesses smaller initial contact angle compared with as-sprayed or polished YSZ coatings, but lower spreading rate and larger equilibrium contact angle. This difference can be attributed to: 1) restricted CMAS spreading by the ablated squares through pinning the solid-liquid-vapor triple-phase contact line; 2) retarded CMAS penetration by microrod-shaped structure inside the ablated squares. This study provides an effective method to improve the CMAS resistance of YSZ coating by femtosecond laser. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sintered specimens of zirconia-10 mol% scandia pure and codoped (up to 1.25 mol%) with europium sexquioxide were prepared by solid-state synthesis, aiming to stabilize at room temperature the high-conductivity cubic phase. High-temperature X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry results reveal that small amounts of the codopant reduce the enthalpy of phase transition, and full stabilization is evidenced for 1 mol% europium sexquioxide. The low-temperature (<600 degrees C) ionic conductivity increases with increasing codopant content. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Heretofore, understandings about the effects of scandium on properties of magnesium alloys for biodegradable implant applications are extremely limited. In the present study, four Mg-1.5Zn-0.6Zr-xSc (ZK21-xSc, x= 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 wt%) alloys were fabricated and investigated with respect to the microstructure and mechanical properties. Microstructure characterization indicated that grain sizes were refined and more precipitated particles were observed with increasing Sc addition. Mechanical testing revealed that improved yield strength and decreased elongation were obtained after Sc being added. Compared with other developed Mg alloys, the ZK21-0.2Sc alloy demonstrates balanced combination of strength and elongation, which shows great potential in biodegradable materials application.

AB WS2/a-C nanocomposite coatings were deposited by magnetron co-sputtering using WS2 and graphite targets. The microstructure and triboperformance of the coatings were scrutinized via microscopy (AFM, SEM, FIB, HRTEM), spectroscopy (XRD, XPS) and tribometry. Atomic WS(2 )platelets are randomly embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix of the as-deposited nanocomposite coating. HRTEM observations of tribofilm/transfer layer reveal that the sliding contact immediately reorients WS2 platelets parallel to the sliding interface and thereby leads to self-adaptive "frictionless" response. The coefficient of friction falls to 0.02 in dry air and reaches 0.10 in humid air, and is reversible as testing atmosphere cycles between dry air and humid air. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The inert and high-strength of zirconia ceramic make it a big challenge to develop simple and reliable methods for increasing surface roughness with controlled morphologies. This study investigated the suitability of femtosecond laser for surface modification of zirconia. The laser pulse energies were set at 180 mu J and 90 mu J respectively, with pulse duration of 35 fs, a repetition rate of 2 kHz, and wave length at 800 nm. Scanning electron microscopy observation of well-distributed periodic and cyclic microstructure revealed the effectiveness of femtosecond laser ablation and minimal collateral damage of the surface. Laser scanning confocal microscope analysis showed femtosecond laser ablation increased the surface roughness significantly, and the depth of the microstructure was related to the pulse energy of the femtosecond laser. X-ray diffraction showed that the original predominant tetragonal phase of zirconia was preserved in the crystalline structure induced by femtosecond laser processing. The obtained results suggest that femtosecond laser treatment offers a fast and promising approach to introduce controlled topography at the micrometric and sub-micrometric scale.

AB The corrosion inhibitive characteristics of the cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale) were studied as an eco-friendly green corrosion inhibitor at ambient temperature of 25 degrees C using weight loss analysis and adsorption isotherms. The effect of inhibitor concentration (4-12 g/l) at immersion time of 3-12 days was evaluated. The inhibitive ability of cashew nut shows a significant inhibition efficiency of 86% at 12 g/l concentration for 3-days and 72.9% at 12-days, which are undoubtedly as a result of the absorption of the inhibitor molecules on the metal surface which serve as a barrier against corrosion of carbon steel in acidic medium. The adsorption mechanism was found to fit Tempkin isotherms. The average optimum free energy of absorption was calculated to be -17.374 kJ mol(-1) indicating that the process was exothermic and physisorption. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The free-radical trapping capability of buckminsterfullerene (C-60) inevitably inhibits peroxide vulcanization, which is one of the most challenges for its application in high temperature vulcanized silicone rubber (HTVSR). In this work, polymethylphenylsiloxane decorated C-60 (PMPS-d-C-60) was fabricated via pi-pi stacking interaction and incorporated into HTVSR. It was found that PMPS-d-C-60 not only overcame the negative effect of C-60 on HTVSR vulcanization, but also effectively enhanced the flame retardancy of HTVSR. By adding only 4.0 phr PMPS-d-C-60, the limiting oxygen index of HTVSR was increased to 29.0%, and its peak of heat release rate was reduced more than 32%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bioactive substrate of particles is an attractive choice for enhancing mineralization in bone healing. TiC-coated carbon particles (TCBs) were prepared via molten salt synthesis. The phase composition, and core-shell structure of TCBs were characterized by XRD, SEM, and TEM. TCBs with different amounts were tested for cell viability. Mineralization was evaluated with ALP activity along with calcium deposition. XRD curves showed that only TiC and carbon phases were observed on the samples. Coating shells of TiC on the carbon cores were clearly seen. In terms of biological functions, TCBs could significantly induce cell viability, ALP activity, and calcium deposition, showing potential applications in bone healing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

DE Nanoparticles; FTIR; Electron microscopy; Biofilm
AB In this research work, barium titanate nanoparticles (BaTiO3 NPs) were prepared by a co-precipitation method using barium nitrate and titanium dioxide precursors. The structural and morphological studies of the NPs were carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The XRD pattern confirmed the formation of the BaTiO3 NPs having an average size less than 100 nm. BaTiO3 NPs were also evaluated for their efficacy against the human pathogenic bacteria. Significant antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities ofBaTiO(3) NPs were observed against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus clinical isolates. Results presented in this work confirm that BaTiO3 NPs can control the growth of biofilm formation activities of pathogenic bacteria at very low concentration and hence suggests their use as alternative antimicrobial agents. This is the first report on chemical method synthesized BaTiO3 NPs for its biofilm inhibition activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this work was to prepare and characterize superabsorbent hydrogels made from chitosan (C) and iota carrageenan (I). For this purpose, different pH values (4-9) and ratios between polysaccharides (C:I = 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1) were evaluated. The pure polysaccharides were characterized by thermal analysis, chemical structure, viscometric analysis and rheological tests. In turn, the hydrogels were characterized by morphological aspects, swelling tests in water, chemical structures and mechanical testing. The results showed that superabsorbent hydrogels were formed, with swelling degrees in water higher than 1000%. The micrographs revealed that the surface of the hydrogels was irregular, rough and porous. The mechanical tests showed that the hydrogels produced with acidic pH (4) had greater compression strength than those prepared with basic pH (9). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As-synthesized double-shelled nanocages were characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM. As active materials for water-based electrochemical energy storage devices, NiCo2S4/CO3S4 showed relatively high discharge capacity and cycling stability, large current adaptability and reversibility. These could be due to the cage-in-cage hollow nanostructure and high electrochemical activity of transition metal sulfide. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption and coadsorption of H2+ and methyl orange (MO) were accomplished using branched polyethyleneimine modified magnetic straw. The adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 40 mins and the maximal adsorption amounts of Hg2+ and MO reached 320.4 and 510.2 mg/g, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters, such as Delta H(0)and Delta S-0 were found as -3.728 kJ/mol and 10.593 J/mol K for the adsorption of Hg2+, while Delta H-0 and Delta S(0 )were found to be -2.119 kJ/mol and 16.123 J/mol K for the adsorption of MO. It was suggested that the adsorptions of Hg2+ and MO were exothermic processes with further increase in the degree of freedom. The respective adsorption mechanism of H2+ and MO involved complexation and electrostatic interactions. In the binary system of H2+ and MO, the adsorption capacity of MO was not affected by the presence of H2+, while the adsorption amount of H2+ significantly increased in the presence of MO through the mechanism of bridge enhancement. Specifically, when the initial concentration of Hg2+ was 0.005 mol/L, the adsorption amounts of Hg2+ were 510.2 and 1858.3 mg/g, respectively in the mono-component and binary systems.

AB YMnO3 powders mainly in orthorhombic structure can be prepared via a facile molten salt synthesis (MSS) method at 700 degrees C for 2 h. The resulting powders had high reflectivity in near-infrared wavelengths. We then studied the phase compositions and the reflectivity in the near-infrared wavelength range of the YMnO3 powders after heat treatment at different temperatures. The orthorhombic phase was completely transformed into a hexagonal phase after heating at 1200 degrees C or above. The heat-treated YMnO3 powders had markedly enhanced near-infrared reflectivity. This indicated that the YMnO3 powders had good thermal stability in the near-infrared reflectivity useful for energy conservation in high-temperature industries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This research focuses on optical properties of bismuth silicate based glasses. The glasses with the composition 60SiO(2)-40Bi(2)O(3) were prepared and 3d transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) with 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1 at% were added. Optical spectra in terms of transmittance were used to analyze color shade with CIELab analysis in all glasses. Transmittance of glasses was changed in intensity and dominant wavelength when the transition metals were incorporated. This resulted in the change of lightness and color shade or CIELab values. Localization of 3d transition metals resulted in change of optical properties by non-bridging oxygen ions, which acted as network modifier. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To enhance the surface hardness and anti-wear performance so as to extend the applications of titanium (Ti) and its alloys in wear environments, TiB reinforced titanium matrix composites coatings were synthesized by tungsten inert gas (TIG) wire-feed deposition (WF-D) utilizing Ti-TiB2 cored wire as feed-stocks for the first time. The coating showed a macroscopically uniform distribution, consisting of two-scale TiB whiskers (TiBw). The hardness of the coating (415 HV0.3) was increased by 108% than that of Ti substrate (200 HV0.3), while the wear loss (23.64 mg) decreased by 52.8% compared with the Ti sub-strate (50.13 mg). The performance improvement is attributed to in-situ two-scale TiBw that enhance the hardness of the coating and increase the resistance to plastic deformation. This work provides a new horizon for preparing anti-wear titanium matrix composites coatings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB NiTi is widely used as bone plates for fixation in bone fracture surgery. For such implant applications the bone plates are commonly coated with hydroxyapatite (HA) to facilitate osseointegration, and doped with silver (Ag) to impart an antibacterial function. In the present study these were achieved via a low-temperature route so as not to disturb the built-in thermomechanical properties of NiTi. An Ag-doped Ca-P coating was first formed on NiTi using AC electrodeposition in an electrolyte containing Ag, Ca, and P ions. The coated samples were subsequently hydrothermally treated at 180 degrees C for 24 h to form HA. The coated samples were immersed in Kokubo's simulated body fluid (SBF) and release of Ag ions in regularly refreshed SBF was measured at regular intervals up to 32 days. It was found that the Ag ion release rate reached a steady value after two weeks, and the Ag ion concentration in the SBF stayed at around 1 mu M, a value which is effectively antibacterial and yet non-cytotoxic according to the literature.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE NiFe; Phosphorsulfurization; Oxygen evolution reaction; Oxidation
AB Developing bimetallic electrocatalysts with unique nanostucture for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for promoting water splitting. Herein, Ni-Fe nanocubes (NiFe NCs) have been synthesized as the templates through a self-assembly process. Then phosphorization, sulfurization or coupling process has been used to prepare different binary Ni-Fe nanocubes samples. The coupled phosphorization and sulfurization (P-S-NiFe NCs) can improve the intrinsic activity, which may be due to rough surface with rich active sites towards OER. Moreover, compared to S-NiFe, P-NiFe and S-P-NiFe NCs, P-S-NiFe NCs maintains intact cubic structure and exhibits superior OER performance with an overpotential of 270 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(2). The order of phosphorization and sulfurization are the key for unique structure and excellent activity. Therefore, the controllable phosphorsulfurization treatment of binary metal-based nanostructure may be a promising strategy to prepare excellent electrocatalysts for water oxidation.

AB We explored an easy technique to transfer directly large-area graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) onto flexible substrates through substrate heating at appropriate temperatures. Polyethylene (PE) films were selected as the flexible substrate. The critical factor to ensure successful transfer was the good contact between the substrate and graphene. By heating the PE films merely approaching their glass-transition temperature, film morphology did not change. The stickiness of PE films further enabled the van der Waal forces to ensure close interaction between the viscoelastic substrate and graphene. This method did not require an intermediate transfer membrane such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) that needs removal afterwards. Though this transfer method, monolayer and multilayer graphene films were transferred onto PE substrates with sheet resistance as low as 158 Omega/sq. All these results can be applied in existing and new graphene CVD applications on flexible substrates. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Molecular dynamics (MD) analysis of continuous creep (CC) and interrupted creep (IC) behaviour of nano crystalline (NC) Cu having grain size similar to 6 nm has been carried out employing Embedded atom potential. The creep deformation intensifies considerably during IC tests compared to CC process. Higher steady-state strain rates are also observed for IC tests as opposed to CC test. Partial strain recovery is also perceived during cooling and subsequent heating at the end of each cycle of IC test. Dislocation nucleation mechanism has a significant role on the accelerated creep behaviour in the IC tests of the NC Cu. Shockley partial dislocations play a crucial role for such enhanced creep deformation behaviour. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of as-cast pure Mg with different grain sizes prepared by ultrasonic treatment were measured in the temperature range of 2-320 K. The grain size has little effect on residual electrical resistivity, but the different samples exhibit different temperature coefficients of resistance. The maximum of thermal conductivity 665 W/(m.K) appears at similar to 20 K where the different grain sizes shows the biggest difference. Less effect of grain size on the thermal conductivity can be observed at room temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cu1-xFexO nanoparticles were prepared by freeze-drying an aqueous solution of copper and iron acetates, followed by a heat treatment. The material was characterized regarding structural, morphological and optical properties by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance. All samples prepared in the 0 <= x <= 0.04 concentration range exhibited a single phase, corresponding to monoclinic structure (space group C2/c). Increasing the iron doping level resulted in the contraction of the unitary cell volume and in the decrease of the particle size and bandgap. The correlation between particle size, bandgap and, iron concentration represents a key information to tuning the material for semiconductor applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report that the Ni nanocrystals with rod-like and cubic shapes can be prepared in organic solution with the aid of tungsten hexacarbonyl at a relatively low reaction temperature of 150 degrees C. The prepared Ni nanorods have a fivefold twinned structure with an average diameter of about 11 nm and length varying from several tens of nanometers to 150 nm whereas the obtained Ni nanocubes have an average size of about 19.2 nm. Magnetic measurements indicate that the as-prepared Ni crystals exhibit typical room-temperature ferromagnetic properties. The synthetic strategy revealed in this study provides useful guidelines for the preparation of non-spherical Ni nanocrystals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using up-to-date methods of material studies, it is revealed that the structure of as cast Al-Si alloy (silumin) is multi-phased and morphologically heterogeneous. It consists of solid solution grains and eutectic Al-Si with a diverse morphology. With the help of selective etching intermetallic compounds (AlNiCu and AlMg) are detected on the grain boundaries of alpha-solid solution. Treatment of silumin samples by the intense pulsed electron beam with the diverse density results in release of the second phase sub-micro and nano-dimensional particles. According to experiments optimal energy densities of the electron beam are 25, 30 and 35 J/sm(2). Silumin irradiation results in a manyfold advance of mechanical and tribological properties of the surface layers. As found out, these characteristics of the surface layers change significantly due to the sub-micro and nano-dimensional structure of cellular crystallization formed by the electron beam, which is free of primary inclusions consisting of silicon and intermetallic compounds.

AB Disk shaped specimens of commercial Zr44Ti11Cu10Ni10Be25 bulk metallic glass (Vitreloy 1b) were subjected to extreme hydrostatic pressure and simultaneous plastic shear deformation by high pressure torsion method at elevated temperatures below (610 K and 620 K) and around the glass transition (630 K). Coupled calorimetric and X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that the amorphous structure of the alloy is very stable up to 620 K, however, destabilization takes place close to the glass transition (T-g) at 630 K. Series of hardness measurements were performed by depth-sensing nanoindentation for the as-cast and the thermo-mechanically treated samples. The shape and the mean value of the hardness distribution of the disks processed below T-g are similar to that of the as-cast glass, nevertheless the hardness distribution becomes broader accompanied with a significant overall increase when the Vitreloy 1b glass is subjected to extreme shear deformation close to T-g.

AB The growth rates of Na2O center dot 2CaO center dot 3SiO(2) crystals on a polished surface, us, and in the volume, u(v)u(v), of the soda lime-silica glass of the same composition were measured in a temperature range spanning from 873 to 1023 K (T-12 = 845 K corresponds to a viscosity eta = 10(12) Pa.s). We found that u(s) is significantly higher than u(v) and this difference progressively increases with decreasing temperature reaching in our experiment more than two orders of magnitude. This fact indicates that at low temperatures the effective diffusion coefficient of the structural units determining the growth kinetics along the glass surface is significantly higher than that in the bulk of glass, and gradually approaches the latter with increasing temperature. We also showed that the temperature at which the decoupling between the surface and volume diffusion coefficients occurs is higher than the decoupling temperature between diffusion coefficients estimated from viscosity via Stokes-Einstein-Eyring equation and by crystal rates in the bulk of glass. Our main conclusion about relation between surface and volume diffusion based on the analysis of surface and volume crystal growth for silicate glass combines the measurements performed for some molecular glasses, which proved that surface diffusion is much faster than volume diffusion.

AB The effect of sub and sup Tg cure and the cooling rate from the cure temperature on the enthalpy recovery of epoxy is explored. Further, it is investigated whether the enthalpy state is linked to shrinkage of the epoxy upon reheating. From modulated DSC measurements it is found that enthalpy relaxation is greater for slower cooling at sup Tg cure, whereas at sub Tg cure, the enthalpy relaxation appears independent of the cooling rate. From modulated TMA measurements it is found that all samples exhibit a linear shrinkage around 0.3% upon reheating irrespective of the cure schedule. The molecular phenomena that could explain this shrinkage are discussed.

AB Gas templating of gels is a novel route in the know-how technology of templating porous gels. This technology depends basically on infusing certain gases into the media of sol-gel reaction upon the gelation process. The templated products have noticeable changes that depend on the synthesis conditions and the type of gas used. Furthermore, the gases used for templating are separated completely by natural means; and thus, the templated gels are not polluted with templating agents, which makes them friendlier to the environment. Resorcinol and formaldehyde precursors were used herein as a representative example for making and designing gas-templated resorcinol and formaldehyde-xerogels (GT-RFXs). It is found that different infused gases have noticeable changes on the characteristics and performances of the formed GT-RFXs.

AB Fluoroquatemary glasses within system 70TeO(2)-10ZnO-10NaF-(10-x)MoO2-xEr(2)O(3) doped with different concentration of xEr(2)O(3) ions were prepared by using melt- quenching technique. The amorphous nature of the glasses confirmed by using X-ray diffraction. Physical parameters viz.: density (rho), molar volumes (V-m), refractive index (n), an optical energy gap (Eg) and Urbach energy (Delta E) values of prepared glasses were evaluated. Moreover, the Judd-Ofelt parameters Omega(2), Omega(4), Omega(6), the oscillator strength type transition probabilities, S-meas, S-cab spectroscopic quality factors, X, branching ratio, beta(R) and radiative lifetimes, tau(R), of several excited states of Er3+ have been computed. The gain cross-section of laser transition level from I-4(13/2)-> I-4(15/2) and stimulated emission cross-section estimated with different concentration of Er2O3 ions in all present glasses. Here the spectroscopic properties indicate that these glasses doped with Er3+ are a promising candidate for optical applications.

AB We present first principles calculations on conversion of a peroxy linkage (POL,  Si-O-O-Si ) defect. GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation methods are introduced. POL defect has different reaction paths when interacts with H-2. It will convert into silanol (Si-OH + Si-OH) at the ground state (S-0) and likely to transfer into Si-OOH + Si-H at the triplet state (T-1). Optical absorption strength of hydrogen-induced defects is higher than the POL defect between 6 and 8 eV and would be more easily lead to a laser-induced damage phenomenon. Our results not only display a better understanding of how H-2 molecular interacts with the POL defect, but also provide a guidance to figure out these defects in silica fiber.

AB Vitreous silica is modelled by Molecular dynamics. Glass structure is transferred into undirected graph and decomposed into disjoint structural units that are ideally mixed to calculate configuration entropy. A good agreement of the approach with experimental heat capacity drop at T-g is demonstrated. Entropy is related with structural evolution of the obtained units; among them dangling oxygen dominantly effects low-temperature course of entropy. Configuration entropy is fitted by two parabolas; the one, corresponding to lower temperatures, introduces temperature T*, at which structure is completely frozen. It is proposed T* is a counterpart of Vogel temperature in Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation. A new model of viscosity is introduced as the combination of the quadratic dependence of configuration entropy and Adam and Gibbs equation. The model removes the singularity at Vogel temperature, predicts existence of strong and fragile glasses, and provides a base for fitting viscosities of real glasses. Fragility is associated with quickness of structural response to temperature changes and the distance between T-g and T*. The validity of the model is demonstrated on experimental data of viscosity for SiO2 and B2O3 glasses.

AB A first principles molecular dynamics technique is employed to generate an amorphous magnesium silicide (Mg2Si) model from its liquid state and its structural, electrical and mechanical features are disclosed for the first time. Si atoms form predominantly the standard square dodecahedron-like and the tri-capped trigonal prism-like configurations while Mg atoms arrange themselves primarily in higher coordinated crystal-like and icosahedrallike polyhedrons. The mean coordination number of Mg and Si is estimated to be similar to 12.84 and similar to 8.2, respectively. Si-Si homopolar bonds are also presented in the amorphous network, in contrast to the crystal. Based on our findings, we propose that the amorphous model has a short-range order, quite different than that of the anti fluorite Mg2Si crystal but similar to that of metallic glasses. The different local structure of the amorphous state yields distinct electronic and mechanical properties, relative to the crystal. Within the known limitation of DFT-GGA simulations, the amorphous Mg2Si is found to be semimetal though the anti-fluorite structure is semiconductor. Furthermore, amorphous Mg2Si is predicted to be less brittle than the crystal structure. Since the potential use of the Mg2Si crystal as a biodegradable implant material is hindered because of its brittle behavior, here we propose that amorphous or nanoglass forms might eliminate this limitation of Mg2Si and hence it can serve as an implant material in near future.

AB Silica aerogels are highly nano-porous and fragile solids, which exhibit brittle properties under tensile loading. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations with a model size up to 5.07 million atoms have been performed to investigate the effect of the crack length to height ratio on the fracture strength, fracture toughness and strain energy release rate. For a wide range of densities from 295 to 1155 kg m(-3), we demonstrate that the fracture toughness and the strain energy release rate at the onset of the crack propagation increase with the crack length to height ratio. Moreover, these fracture properties were found to exhibit a power law dependence on the aerogel density with exponent values of 2.02 +/- 0.05 for the fracture toughness and 1.16 +/- 0.04 for the strain energy release rate. The investigations presented grant a more comprehensive understanding of the fracture behavior and provide a mechanistic basis for reliable applications of silica aerogels.

AB The melt quenched Gd-75(Ni1-xFex)(25) alloys are found to exhibit a soft ferrimagnetic behavior in the whole concentration range (0 <= x <= 1). Substitution of Fe for Ni in the Gd-75(Ni1-xFex)(25) alloys results in a linear growth of the magnetic ordering temperature from 118 K to 244 K; although, an average value of the magnetic moment per transition metal atom, obtained from saturation magnetization measurements, does not change significantly with increasing Fe content. The variations of the Curie temperature and magnetization in Gd(75)M(25)stype amorphous alloys (M = Fe, Ni) are discussed bearing in mind a possible noncollinearity of magnetic moments of 3d metal atoms. The maximal values of the isothermal magnetic entropy change (AS,) are observed to exhibit the Fe-poor Gd-75(Ni1-x,Fe-x)(25) alloys. The change in the concentration of 3d-metal of different types in amorphous Gd75M25 alloys with a constant gadolinium content makes it possible to vary both the magnetocaloric effect and the operating temperature range.

AB The various ultrasonic properties of PbO-V2O5, MoO3-PbO-V2O5, P2O5 -V2O5, and CuO-P2O5-V2O5 and TeO2-K2O-V2O5 glass systems were analyzed and predicted over a wide range of composition. The theoretical elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio were evaluated on the basis of Makishima-Mackenzie's theory and Rocherulle et al. model and compared with the corresponding experimental ones. The composition dependence of ultrasonic attenuation coefficient in PbO-V2O5 glasses has also been analyzed and predicted, for the first time, using Abd El-Moneim's semi-empirical formula, which correlates the room temperature ultrasonic attenuation coefficient with the packing density, dissociation energy per unit volume and average first-order stretching force constant. The results revealed that:
   i- The agreement between theoretical and experimental elastic moduli of P2O5-V2O5, CuO-P2O5-V2O5 and TeO2-K2O-V2O5 glasses is excellent for majority of the samples;
   ii- The correlation between theoretical and experimental elastic moduli of PbO-V2O5 and MoO3-PbO-V2O5 glasses is improved significantly when the effect of the basic structural units VO5 and VO4 on the glass dissociation energy per unit volume is taken into account; and
   iii- Abd El-Moneim's semi-empirical formula for ultrasonic attenuation coefficient appears to be valid for PbO-V2O5 glasses. The correlation between ultrasonic attenuation coefficient, packing density and dissociation energy per unit volume was achieved through the average first-order stretching force constant of V-O-V linkages.

AB The creation and characterization of Ce doped surface regions in Li-6 enriched silicate glasses for cold neutron detection is described. A diffusion layer of a dried solution containing cerium III acetylacetonate hydrate was thermally diffused into monolithic glass samples under a reducing atmosphere. The diffusion characteristics of the mixed valence cerium compound were assayed with Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry. The Ce diffusion activation energy within the glass was found to be 411 +/- 53 kJ/mol (4.26 +/- 0.55 eV). Radiation induced color centers formed on the diffusion samples as an effect of using alpha bombardment measurements. The ratio of Ce valence states of the diffused cerium was assayed as a function of depth with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and the signal from Ce for the color centers was compared to the unirradiated sample surface.

AB Glasses are a class of materials that have a multitude of uses and applications. In catalysis, they are frequently used as support materials. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that glass can be applied as an active material in catalysis. The glass was successfully applied as catalysts in bioactive bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) molecules with the capability to extend the reaction substrate to other N-heterocycle. Furthermore, we describe the synthesis and characterization of cheap and readily available borophosphate glass samples produced using a classical melt-quenching technique and their application as a catalyst. The main features of this glass-catalyzed reaction are high yields, recyclable catalyst, ease of scale-up to gram scale, and a solvent-free and metal-free approach.

AB The effects of composition and structure on stress-induced birefringence were studied for glasses with the nominal molar compositions xZnO (67-x)SnO-33P(2)O(5). The photoelastic constant (PEC) changes systematically from negative values to positive values when ZnO replaces SnO, and PEC approximate to 0 when x = 18.5 mol%. The zero PEC composition can be predicted from the observed coordination numbers and bond lengths of the Zn-, Sn-, and P-polyhedra using an empirical model from the literature.

SO JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS

DE Thermal conductivity; Glass; First-principles molecular dynamics
ID SIMULATIONS
AB The thermal conductivity of a glass can be obtained by first-principles molecular dynamics provided we exploit a methodology that has been termed the "approach-to-equilibrium" molecular dynamics (AEMD) [1,2, Chap. 8]. In the present work, we investigate the occurrence of size effects by comparing the thermal conductivity of two g-GeTe4 atomic models of different sizes. This issue is far from being trivial since, in principle, size effects are not expected to occur in disordered systems beyond a few interatomic distances. For this reason, it is important to search unambiguous pieces of evidence substantiating this point. The first system of length L = 18 angstrom contains 185 atoms. By duplicating it along one direction we form the second system, that contains 370 atoms and features a double length L = 36 angstrom and an identical cross section. The thermal conductivity increases by a factor 3 from L = 18 to 36 angstrom, thereby approaching the experimental value. Our investigation exemplifies the crucial role of the system size to take full advantage of the AEMD methodology and bring the calculated values in better agreement with experiments.

SO JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS

DT Article
DE Borophosphate glasses; Solid electrolytes; Acoustic attenuation;
   Internal friction; Ionic conduction
AB Alkali borophosphate glasses have recently gained strong interest, not only for their fundamental importance due to the mixed glass former effect but also because of their potential applicability as solid state electrolytes in energy harvesting devices. In the present work, internal friction measurements of lithium and sodium borophosphate glasses have been performed in order to look for further insights on the relationships between the ionic conduction mechanism and the structure of the glasses that has been previously determined. Absorption of acoustic waves shows two marked internal friction peaks with activation energy in the range of the activation energy for the ionic conduction of the glasses between 0.5 and 0.7 eV. Furthermore, the substitution of phosphorus by boron network former results in the decrease of the activation energy associated to both processes in parallel to the Ea of the ionic conduction of alkali cations; and the relationship between the areas of both peaks suggests a change of the distribution of alkali ions between positions energetically different in agreement with the structural changes of the glass network.

AB In this work, SiO2-CaO-P2O5 based bioactive glasses were synthesized by the sol-gel method using calcium L-lactate pentahydrate and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (CaNT) as calcium oxide precursors in order to achieve an improvement of the material bioactivity. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, then they were assessed from the perspective of their bioactive properties, while the textural properties were evaluated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The XRD pattern confirms the amorphous structure for all samples, except the glass synthesized with CaNT, where few crystallization centres associated with apatite phase were identified. A higher specific surface area and pore volume were obtained for the glasses prepared with calcium L-lactate pentahydrate in comparison with those obtained by using CaNT, result that was expected to be favorable in terms of bioactivity. The in vitro bioactivity assessment revealed the occurrence of a more pronounced apatite layer onto the glass' surfaces prepared with calcium L-lactate pentahydrate than as for the samples obtained with CaNT.

The bioactive glass (BG) and three groups of fluoride-doped (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mol%) bioactive glasses (F-BG) powders were synthesized by a base-catalyzed sol-gel method. The prepared samples were heat treated and were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area analyzer. The prepared heat-treated F-BG samples were amorphous in nature, except F-BAG with 2.5 mol% fluoride which was glass-ceramic with few characteristic peaks of fluorapatite and teracalcium phosphate phases. High surface area of these prepared powders were observed, however, it was decreased with the increase in fluoride contents and particle size. A 6 month long fluoride release behavior was studied periodically in deionized water using an Ion Selective Electrode. Fluoride release was maximum with F-BG (7.5% mol.%), however, the insignificant difference was observed among samples. Initially, high pH value was exhibited by all samples, where highest pH was observed with BG and least with F-BAG (5 mol%). The resulting F-BG (5% mol.%) has potential to be used in dentifrices, restorative materials and for other dental applications.

AB A novel approach to determine conduction mechanisms in complex amorphous materials was presented and tested on a real system. In the first step of the presented method, total electrical admittance of the material is analyzed in order to separate a couple of processes, each of which can be described by Jonscher's universal dielectric response. In the following step, a temperature dependence of dielectric response parameters of the processes is determined and compared with known models of conduction mechanisms in structural amorphous materials. Using this approach, a presence of two different conduction mechanisms describing electrical conductivity in a two-phase glass was described.

Structure analyses were carried by FTIR, and chemical durability tests were introduced to study changes in dissolution rate and weight losses. Thermal stability properties were measured and discussed through DSC. Results from structure changes indicate that glass network turns less compact with more ZnO, the building units gradually evolving into Q(0) groups from Q(1) tetrahedra, even the whole glass system locates in orthophosphate glasses. Higher melting temperature results in more Fe2+ that would lead to octahedral and disordered octahedral in the prepared glasses also contributing to open glass network in glass structure. The resistance in both alkali and acid solution were deteriorated for the sake of the open network, accompanied with the less strong P-O-Zn bonds when compared with the P-O-P bonds. Reasons accounting for the weak resistance also refer to the transition from [ZnO6] to [ZnO4], larger volume of [ZnO4] than that of [PO4], small particle size in ternary phosphate glasses. Drops in weight loss for each test span with corrosion time might be owing to the formation of alter layer on the surface of glass samples during corrosion. The phenomenon in water also follow the similar trend as those in the other two solutions for the same reasons. The glass transition and crystalline temperatures of all glasses drop as the degree of polymerization in glass becomes small, with four glass stability parameters falling as the amount of ZnO rises.

AB This study investigates the utilization of basalt in manufacturing machinable glass ceramics. As the fluorine and potassium phases, MgF2 and K2O added into basalt are responsible for the machinability of glass ceramics. Three different compositions containing 80%, 85%, and 90% basalt, with K2O and MgF2 as the remainder, were mixed and melted in an alumina crucible at 1500 degrees C. Glass samples were obtained by casting the melt into a graphite mould. Glass ceramics were prepared through subsequent crystallization heat treatment of the obtained glass. Compositional and mechanical characterizations were carried out via XRD-SEM and hardness/fracture toughness and machinability tests respectively. The effect of change in the obtained phases with basalt composition on the machinability of glass ceramics was investigated. Furthermore, crystallization kinetics of the glasses were investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA) using the Kissinger kinetic model with several different heating rates. This study reports that basalt can be utilized in the production of machinable glass ceramics only if the basalt ratio is justified. The results showed that good machining performance was observed in low-basalt content conditions (B80), When the basalt content increased (B85 and B90), the machining capability decreased markedly. Furthermore, the crystallization activation energies decreased with increase in basalt content.

AB Photoemission and inverse-photoemission spectroscopy (PES and IPES) measurements were carried out on Zr50Cu50, Zr45Cu45Ag10, and Zr40Cu40Ag20 metallic glasses to investigate the valence- and conduction-band electronic structures, respectively. From the incident photon energy, hv, dependence of the PES spectra, partial DOSs of s and d electrons for the constituent elements were estimated, and it was found that the DOS near E-F is mainly composed of Zr 4d electrons and the Cu 3d electrons are localized in the valence band. Core-level PES measurements were also performed at the Zr 3d, Cu 3p, and Ag 3d levels. The Zr 3d core spectra indicate three chemical states in all of these glasses, suggesting a chemical heterogeneity. Energy shifts are observed in the Zr 3d core levels, indicating the charge transfer in the Zr-Cu-Ag metallic glass system.

AB A thorough understanding of the interactions of CO2 with the hosting porous network is crucial for the design of new adsorbent materials with enhanced gas adsorption capacity and selectivity. In this paper, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations are performed to assess the interactions of CO2 adsorbed in a nanoporous glassy chalcogenide (i.e. chalcogel) under relevant laboratory conditions. The structure and local organization of the confined CO2 molecules are analyzed in terms of atomic density, orientational order parameter and pair correlation functions. Maximally localized Wannier functions are used to unravel the electronic structure, the local molecular dipole and the nature of the chemical bonding at the interface between CO2 and the glassy surface. Our results provide a useful insight on the complex interplay between the chemical interactions competing at the buried interface made by the CO2 molecules adsorbed in g-GeS2 chalcogel.

AB Borosilicate glasses are traditionally challenging to model using atomic scale simulations due to the composition and thermal history dependence of the coordination state of B atoms. Here, we report a new empirical interatomic potential that shows a good transferability over a wide range of borosilicate glasses ranging from pure silicate to pure borate end members while relying on a simple formulation and a constant set of energy parameters. In particular, we show that our new potential accurately predicts the compositional dependence of the average coordination number of boron atoms, glass density, overall short-range and medium-range order structure, and shear viscosity values for several borosilicate glasses and liquids. This suggests that our new potential could be used to gain new insights into the structure of a variety of advanced borosilicate glasses to help elucidate composition-structure-property relationships including in complex nuclear waste immobilization glasses.

AB The viscosity-temperature relation of three typical Fe-based glass-forming alloys was investigated by rotational vibration-type high-temperature melt viscometry and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. It was shown that during the first heating process until 1500 degrees C, the viscosity decreased suddenly at approximately 1400 degrees C, demonstrating a structural transition which was confirmed by the thermoanalysis. However, if the heating temperature was below 1400 degrees C or during the following second thermal cycle, such structural transition cannot be observed. The viscosity curves of all samples during cooling processes can be well described by the Arrhenius equation, in which the activation energy was inversely proportional to the Fe content. The Fe2B-like clusters have higher total energy, higher melting point and larger size than that of Fe3B-like clusters. Thus, we suggested that the structural transition may be related to the transformation from Fe2B-like clusters to Fe3B-like clusters. The structural transition in liquid was eliminated and a homogeneous Fe-based alloy melt was obtained after a rather long relaxation time at a temperature higher than the melting point of infusible clusters. This study could offer some helpful reference for understanding the nature of alloy melt and the quality control of Fe-based amorphous alloys.

AB A series of borate glasses mixed with different modifiers (viz., PbO, BaO, CaO, MgO and ZnO of 10 mol% each) and doped with different concentrations of TiO2 (1.0 to 3.0 mol% in the steps of 0.5) was prepared by melt quenching technique. The prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM and spectroscopic techniques. The XRD studies have confirmed the amorphous nature of the samples while the SEM pictures revealed the presence of minute fraction of crystallites (of the size < 0.1 mu m) in the samples. IR spectral studies of the glasses exhibited vibrational bands due to BO3, BO4, B-O-B PbO4, ZnO4, TiO4 and TiO6 structural units. The optical absorption and EPR spectral studies have revealed probable presence of Ti3+ ions that act as modifiers and induce structural defects such as dangling bonds, non-bridging oxygens (NBO's) in the glass network. The observed decrease in the optical band gap with increase in the concentration of TiO2 is attributed to the gradual reduction of Ti4+ ions (which participate in the glass network forming) in to Ti3+ ions that act as modifiers.

AB Two methodological approaches to describe changes in the optical transmission spectra of chalcogenide semiconductor glasses induced by high-energy gamma-irradiation are considered at the example of glassy arsenic sulfides. The studied radiation-optical effects are ascribed to destruction-polymerization transformations, both intrinsic and related to surface oxidation. Direct-chronology ex-situ and backward-chronology in-situ measuring protocols can be utilized to parameterize them in glasses, while the former includes unresolved input from natural and radiation-assisted physical ageing in addition to mismatch between control and reference glasses. The reliable signature of intrinsic radiation-optical phenomenology unbiased by competitive input from oxidation and physical ageing is provided with in-situ measurements for the same irradiated glass.
   The developed approaches are probed for glassy As40S60 and As30S70, which demonstrate principally different responses on radiation-structural transformations and accompanied physical ageing. Critical assessment is given on misleading speculations ignoring intrinsic changes in view of competitive contribution from radiation-induced surface oxidation and thermally-assisted ageing. Stoichiometric As2S3, showing dramatic changes in optical transmission spectra, is nominated as canonical model object among chalcogenide glasses revealing highest sensitivity to gamma-irradiation. These methodological solutions are in excellent agreement with structure-modification criteria developed to parameterize compositional trends in radiation-optical response of chalcogenide glass.

AB Sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON) based glass is emerging as solid electrolyte material for Na-ion batteries. In the present study, we report the influence of Ag+ -> Na+ ion-exchange process on the electrical, optical, structural and mechanical properties of NASICON type glass with a chemical formula of Na2.8Ca0.3Al2Ga0.5P2.7O12 (NCAGP). Ag+ ion exchange process was carried out by dipping NCAGP glass in AgNO3 molten salt at 300 degrees C for 15 min (IE15min) and 30 min (IE30min). The diffusion depth of Ag+ ions was measured to be about similar to 7 mu rn and similar to 25 mu m for IE15min and IE30min samples, respectively. The dc conductivity values were obtained from base (NCAGP), IE15min and IE30min bulk glass samples through the complex impedance plots at a temperature range of 75 degrees C-200 degrees C. With the increase in ion-exchange time, the dc conductivity slightly diminished on account of marginally increase in activation energy (Ea) values. Optical absorption spectra for 30 min ion-exchanged glass revealed the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band, confirming the reduction of Ag+ ion to Ag-0 metal with an increase in ion-exchange time from 15 min to 30 min. Presence of Raman vibrational peak at 233 cm(-1) has also confirmed the formation of Ag-O bonds. The mechanical hardness values obtained through Vickers indentation method reveal enhanced hardness and crack resistance of bulk glasses with the ion-exchange treatment by causing compressive stress on the surface of NCAGP glass. The threshold load for the crack generation is increased from 0.5 kgf (4.9 N) to 2 kgf (19.6 N) after the ion-exchange treatment. Overall, improved mechanical and good electrical properties reveal the applicability of IE15min NCAGP glass as an electrolyte material for Na-ion batteries.

AB Ce-containing bioactive glasses are of great interest in biomedical field since they exert antioxidant properties associated with low toxicity and a broad spectrum of bacteriostatic activities. The results obtained by classical molecular dynamics simulations allow the elucidation of the correlations between the effect of the inclusion of cerium doping ions into the structure of phosphosilicate and silicate bioactive glasses and their properties. The addition of small quantities of Ce to the silicate bioglass favours the depolymerisation of the silicate network with a positive effect on the ability to dissolve in body fluid. Moreover, the under coordination of both the Ce3+ and Ce4+ species in these glasses enhances their catalytic activity towards hydrogen peroxide. Conversely, the formation of cerium phosphate domains in the phosphosilicate glasses leads to detrimental effects for both the solubility and the catalytic activity of the glasses. Finally, a new quantitative view of the structure-activity relationships governing the macroscopic properties of these glasses has been obtained by means of structural descriptor that takes into account the fragmentation of the Si network and the consequent rearrangement of the modifier ions and the network destruction per cerium unit descriptor.

AB First-principles molecular dynamics have been employed to highlight the structural properties of glassy Ga10Ge15Te75 (GGT), a promising disordered system for infrared applications. Our approach relies entirely on the predictive power of density functional theory, in combination with a careful choice of the exchange-correlation functional and the account of van der Waals interactions. Glassy GGT can be viewed as a predominantly tetrahedral network, both with respect to Ge and Ga atoms. Te atoms are mostly twofold coordinated to all combinations of pairs of Ge, Ga or Te atoms. We find little evidence of intermediate range order in the partial structure factors.

AB The present work illustrates the optical absorption and fluorescence properties of Pr3+ ions doped single alkali and mixed alkali fluoro tungsten tellurite glasses prepared by using melt quenching technique. The prepared glasses were characterized by using absorption, excitation and photoluminescence (PL) spectral measurements. The energies of the absorption spectral features called oscillator strengths were calculated using area method and in turn used to evaluate the Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters (Omega(2), Omega(4), Omega(6)). Such J-O parameters are used to estimate various radiative parameters such as radiative transition probabilities (A(R)), branching ratios (beta(R)), and radiative lifetimes (tau(R)) for the prominent fluorescent levels of Pr3+ ions in these glasses. The PL spectra of the as prepared glasses show three prominent peaks at wavelengths 488, 646 and 670 nm related to the transitions P-3(0) -> H-3(4), P-3(0) -> F-3(2) and D-1(2) -> H-3(5) respectively for which emission cross-sections and branching ratios were evaluated. The variations in the spectral parameters with the variation of glass matrix composition have been examined in detailed. The decay profiles of the prepared glasses have been recorded to evaluate quantum efficiency of present series of glasses. From the measured branching ratios, emission cross-sections and quantum efficiency, it was concluded that the tungsten tellurite glasses added with potassium fluoride and doped with 1 mol% of Pr3+ ions (TeWK glass) are quite suitable to produce visible red emission at 670 nm suitable to fabricate red luminescent devices.

AB In this work, the electrical and optical properties of glasses and glass-ceramics are presented and discussed in details. Several electrical and optical parameters for glasses and glass-ceramics were determined. The conduction activation energy and DC conductivity depend on temperature, glass composition and concentration of glass modifiers. The optical properties of glasses and glass-ceramics containing Er3+ (or Er3+/Yb3+) ions have been analyzed for near-infrared luminescence centered at about 1.5 mu m and up-conversion applications. In particular, luminescence bandwidths and lifetimes for the I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/2) transition of Er3+ were determined as a function of host-matrices and then examined for near-infrared solid-state lasers and broadband optical amplifiers. The green up-conversion luminescence spectra for Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+ doped systems are temperature-dependent and can be used to optical sensors.

AB Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of nano-porous lithium disilicate (Li2Si2O5) systems have been performed in previous work [Junko Habasaki, J. Chem. Phys., 145, 204503 (2016)], where importance of caged ion dynamics in porous materials was shown. The shape of the self-part of the Van Hove function and the non-Gaussian parameter clearly show a heterogeneous and non-Gaussian character of the dynamics in the porous system. In the present work, changes of characteristic times of the mean squared displacement are examined and from which the effects on the complicated dynamics of ions by introducing pores are shown.

AB The glasses of composition (35-x) Li2O-5ZrO(2)-10Y(2)O(3)-50SiO(2): x NiO (0 < x < 0.5) have been synthesized. The amorphous nature of the samples is verified by XRD studies and DTA studies. The information on of various structural vibrational units (viz., zirconate, silicate) and their compositional dependence of is evaluated by FT-IR and Raman studies. The results of these studies have indicated that there is a growth of asymmetrical bands at the expense of symmetrical bands of silicate units with increasing concentration of NiO. The optical absorption (OA) and photoluminescence (PL) spectral of Li2O-ZrO2-Y2O3-SiO2: NiO glasses indicated gradual increase of octahedral occupancy of Ni2+ ions in the glass network with the increase in the concentration of NiO in the glass network.

AB An influence of the rare earth ions (La, Er) concentration on the luminescent properties of Ga2S3-La2S3-Er2S3 glasses in the visible and near-infrared spectral region has been studied. The analysis of absorption spectra and luminescence allow understanding of the redistribution processes of radiation energy. The results suggest that favorable visible and near-IR luminescence of Er3+ ions can be further modified in Ga2S3-La2S3-Er2S3 chalcogenide glasses through the effect of doping concentration and modification of environment (rare earth ions of Lanthanum act as a network modifier) of the optically active ions by the matrices composition changes.

AB Influence of ZnO concentration (0 to 35 wt%) on the spectroscopic properties of the Dy3+ doped zinc telluroborate glasses prepared by melt quenching technique has been studied and reported. Their structural and optical properties have been examined through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, optical absorption, photoluminescence and lifetime measurements. Nature of metal-ligand bond in the glass matrix was examined through Nephelauxetic ratio (beta) and bonding parameter (delta) values. The bonding parameter, delta increases from -0.976 to -1.115 with increasing concentration of ZnO, indicating predominant ionic character of the Dy3+-ligand bond. Judd-Ofelt parameters (Omega(2), Omega(4) and Omega(5)) were obtained from the absorption measurements. Addition of ZnO leads to an increase in the Omega(2) value indicating a larger asymmetry around the Dy3+ ion site. The decay profile of F-4(9/2) state of Dy3+ ions exhibits bi-exponential nature. Application of Inokuti-Hirayama model indicates the quenching to be caused by dipole-dipole relaxation. Stimulated emission cross section, chromaticity colour coordinates (0.37, 0.41), colour correlated temperature value (4371 K) and colour purity (35%) were found to be good for TB3OZD glass. Hence it is suggested to be a suitable candidate for laser and white light emitting diode applications.

AB We report the enhanced infrared-to-visible frequency upconversion (UC) in Yb3+/Er3+ codoped Bi2O3-GeO2 (BGO) glasses prepared using the melt quenching technique, with low concentration of AgNO3, Silver nano particles (NPs) with average size around 4 nm were observed using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM). The experiments were performed by exciting the samples with 980 nm diode laser in resonance with the F-2(5/2) -> F-2(7/2) transition of Yb3+ ions. Emission bands were observed at 525, 545 and 655 nm that correspond to the following transitions of the infrared-to-visible frequency UC of Er3+ : H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2), S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2), respectively. Enhancement of the UC luminescence efficiency up to 100% was obtained, attributed to the simultaneous influence of the increased local field in the vicinity of the silver NPs and the contribution of the Yb3+ -> Er3+ energy transfer; it was also observed that the largest enhancement occurred for the band centered at 525 nm whose transition wavelength is closer to the silver NPs localized surface plasmon (LSP) wavelength. This is the first time that these effects are investigated for a bismuth germanate glass and demonstrate that Yb3+/Er3+ codoped BGO glasses with silver NPs can be used as efficient luminescent nano composite material for photonics applications.

AB This paper deals with the properties of the glasses and thin films from multi-component chalcogenide prepared by co-evaporation technique. The thin chalcogenide layers from the Ge30Se70-xInx system were deposited by thermal co-evaporation of bulk glasses from Ge-Se system and In2Se3. Using X-ray microanalysis it was found that the film compositions are close to the expected ones. The refractive index, n, and the optical band gap, E-g(opt), were determined by spectral ellipsometric measurements. The thin film's structure was investigated by Raman spectroscopy.
   The temperature coefficients of the linear thermal expansion, alpha 1 and the band gap, beta(Eg) were determined. Decrease of the values of at from 2.49 x 10(-4) K-1 to 4.55 x 10(-5) K-1 and beta(Eg) from -1.3 x 10(-3) eV.K-1 to -0.7 x 10(-3) eV.K-1 was observed when indium content in the thin films was increased from 0 to 17 at.%.

AB The main objective of this study is to achieve Ce substituted hydroxy apatite (HAp) deposition on the surface of the bio-active glasses which is more affective in antibacterial activity. Calcium oxy fluoro borophosphate glasses (with BaO as modifier) doped with different concentrations of Ce2O3 were prepared by melt quenching techniques. In vitro bioactivity studies were performed by soaking the samples in simulated body fluid (SBF) for about 30 days. The XRD and SEM studies have revealed the deposition of cerium substituted crystalline HAp coating on the surface of the post immersed glasses. The formation of HAp layer is further confirmed by IR and Raman spectral studies. The possible site preference of cerium ions in the HAp layer has been discussed using the results of above mentioned studies. The information regarding dependence of the magnitude of HAp layer developed on the concentration of Ce2O3 dopant is obtained by degradation studies viz., weight loss of the samples and the variation of pH of the residual solutions. The analysis of the results of degradability together with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Infrared (IR), Raman and optical absorption spectra indicated the increasing magnitude of Ce-HAp with the concentration of Ce2O3. Some of the characterization studies have also pointed out the co-presence of Ce ions in Ce4+ oxidation state along with Ce3+ state in the glass samples. The simultaneous presence of cerium ions in these two states in the crystalline HAp layer is predicted to be more useful in promoting the antibacterial activity of the glasses.

In 20Gd(2)O(3)-60MoO(3)-20B(2)O(3) glass, the Gd4Mo7O27 crystalline phase was formed initially in heat-treatments at near the glass transition temperature (T-g = 516 degrees C) prior to the formation of the beta '-Gd-2(MoO4)(3) crystalline phase at near the crystallization peak temperature (T-p = 583 degrees C). In 18.89Gd(2)O(3)-66.11MoO(3)-15B(2)O(3)-1Al(2)O(3) glass (T-g = 507 degrees C and T-p = 572 degrees C) with Gd2O3/MoO3 = 1/3.5, Gd4Mo7O27 crystals were formed through the crystallization and present stably in the wide temperature range and transformed into beta '-Gd-2(MoO4)(3) crystals at a high temperature of 900 degrees C, proposing new glass-ceramics consisting of Gd4Mo7O27 crystals. The self-powdering phenomenon was not observed in the crystallized glasses with Gd4Mo7O27.

AB UV absorption spectra of quaternary tellurite glasses in the form TeO2-WO3-Li2O-Nb2O5/Sm2O3/Pr6O11/Er2O3 were measured in the range 200-850 nm. Optical energy gap E-ASF(opt). (eV), E-DASF(opt). (eV), Urbach's energy E-u (eV), and refractive index (n) were calculated using both absorption spectrum fitting (ASF) and derivation of absorption spectrum fitting (DASF) methods. Room temperature electric measurements were carried out by using LCR Hi Tester Meter Bridge in the frequency range of 100 Hz-100 kHz. Dielectric constant, epsilon ', dielectric loss, epsilon '', and ac conductivity, sigma(ac), have been found. Results show that, in ASF method the optical energy gap values are in the range of 3.59 to 4.58 and 4.76 to 5.18 eV for indirect and indirect transition, respectively, while in DASf method, the optical energy gap values are in 5.14 to 5.30 eV. Refractive index values for glass systems are in the range of 2.06 to 2.25 and 1.973 to 2.254 for indirect and indirect transition, respectively in ASF method, while in DASF method it takes values from 1.95 to 1.97. Electrical data epsilon ', epsilon '' and sigma(ac) of the present glasses were in the range 18,611.9 to 24,670.9 +/- 0.25, 2070.4 to 2842.8 +/- 0.15 at (100 Hz) and 4.50 to 6.26 +/- 0.05 x 10(-4) (Omega.cm)(-1) (100 kHz), respectively.

AB SeO2 doped high polarizable heavy metal oxides 10B(2)O(3)-40PbO-50Bi(2)O(3) glasses have been prepared by normal melt-quenching technique. The SeO2 modified glass structure, optical and electrical properties were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and electrical measurement. Good vitrification was achieved for SeO2 up to 15%, exceed this value, Bi6SeO11 crystallines with size ranging from 20 nm to 50 nm would form in glass which was confirmed by XRD, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS).
   Compared with 10B(2)O(3)-40PbO-50Bi(2)O(3) glass, the SeO2 modification decreased the band energy and accordingly red-shifted the cutoff edge greatly along with an increase of absorption in UV-VIS range. FT-IR spectra ascertained the co-existence of characteristic vibration bands of SeO42-, SeO32-, BiO6 and BiO6 frame units changed with SeO2 concentration. Such change in structure and optical property predominantly influenced the electrical conductivity, showing a progressive increase from 10(-6) to 10(-4) at 1-10(5) Hz and 473 K-573 K, due to the low gap energy, high polarizability, and non-bridging oxygen numbers induced by SeO32- ions in glass.

AB Phosphate glass doped with Sm3+ ions was prepared by melting in ambient atmosphere with multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) added to batch materials to evaluate their impact on material optical properties. An enhanced UV transparency occurs similar to that of a glass melted just with MWCNT5. However, the glass melted only with MWCNT shows evidence of carbon-related luminescent defects, whereas the luminescence of these becomes suppressed in the Sm3+-doped glass melted with the MWCNTs. A comparison with the photoluminescence (PL) of a Sm3+-doped reference (i.e., not melted with MWCNTs) shows that addition of MWCNTs produces an improvement in Sm3+ PL in the visible and near-IR regions. The enhanced PL is observed for resonant excitation in the UV and non-resonantly under 300 nm excitation. It is suggested that the reduced host absorption contributes to the improved PL for resonant excitation of Sm3+ in the UV, while the non-resonant pathway may be related to an energy transfer from the luminescent defects produced in the host. It is the first time to our knowledge that this type of sensitized emission is reported.

AB Phosphate glasses are of great interest for basic research and for special applications in various fields as technical and optical glasses. Metaphosphate compositions with PO4-chain structure are mostly used. The cations have a significant effect on the properties of the glasses and melts. This was studied in more details. High purity metaphosphate glasses, M-n(PO3)(n) with M = Na+, K+,Zn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Al3+ and Fe3+, were prepared and the optical and thermal properties were measured with different methods. The electrical conductivity of glasses and melts is the property of great practical importance. It was determined by impedance spectroscopy in a wide temperature range from 300 to 1250 degrees C in frequency range of 0.1Hz to 6 MHz. The electrical conductivity of alkaline earth phosphate glasses and melts increases with increasing ion radius of the cation. NaPO3 and KPO3 glasses and melts have much higher conductivity. Viscosity measurements were carried out from transformation temperature, T-g, to the melt. The measured data were fitted and the activation energies of the conductivity and viscosity were calculated. Simple exponential behavior was found at temperatures below T-g, but above T-g, only in very narrow temperature range. The relation between conductivity and viscosity was considered.

AB The effect of substituting LiF on physical, structural, thermal, optical and photoluminescence properties of Dy3+ doped calcium bismuth borate glasses is reported in the present work. These glasses have been synthesized in the novel compositional range xLiF-(30-x)CaO-20Bi(2)O(3)-50B(2)O(3) + 1 mol% of Dy2O3 (x = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 mol %, abbreviated as LFx) through convenient melt-quench route. Non-crystalline nature of each composition has been confirmed through X-ray diffraction. Fundamental vibrations of bismuth-borate groups are identified thorough mid-IR absorption spectra. Thermal properties reveal a non-linear trend in glass transition and crystallization temperatures. In order to evaluate optical band gap, analysis of fundamental absorption edge has been done by considering valid Mott's transitions. The compositional trends in optical band gap have supported thermal and infrared absorption results. Evaluation of photoluminescence emission spectra yielded different emission parameters viz. Y/B ratio, color coordinates (x, y) and CCT (correlated color temperature). It has been found that emission of all compositions lie within the white light region and the emission parameters for samples LF2, LF7 and LF10 lie very close to perfect white light (0.333, 0.333). Therefore, these glasses can play the role of useful materials for WLEDs.

AB The aim of this paper is to compute the mean field and variance of solutions to three-dimensional Maxwell's equations with random interfaces via shape calculus and pivoted low-rank approximation. Based on the perturbation theory and shape calculus, we characterize the statistical moments of solutions to Maxwell's equations with random interfaces in terms of the perturbation magnitude via the first order shape-Taylor expansion. In order to capture oscillations with high resolution close to the interface, an adaptive finite element method using Nedelec's third order edge elements of the first kind is employed to solve the deterministic Maxwell's equations with the mean interface to approximate the expectation of solutions. For the second moment computation, an efficient low-rank approximation of the pivoted Cholesky decomposition is proposed to compute the two-point correlation function to approximate the variance of solutions. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate our theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For a large class of orthogonal basis functions, there has been a recent identification of expansion methods for computing accurate, stable approximations of a quantity of interest. This paper presents, within the context of uncertainty quantification, a practical implementation using basis adaptation, and coherence motivated sampling, which under assumptions has satisfying guarantees. This implementation is referred to as Basis Adaptive Sample Efficient Polynomial Chaos (BASE-PC). A key component of this is the use of anisotropic polynomial order which admits evolving global bases for approximation in an efficient manner, leading to consistently stable approximation for a practical class of smooth functionals. This fully adaptive, non-intrusive method, requires no a priori information of the solution, and has satisfying theoretical guarantees of recovery. A key contribution to stability is the use of a presented correction sampling for coherence-optimal sampling in order to improve stability and accuracy within the adaptive basis scheme. Theoretically, the method may dramatically reduce the impact of dimensionality in function approximation, and numerically the method is demonstrated to perform well on problems with dimension up to 1000.

AB Defining acoustically well-posed boundary conditions is one of the major numerical and theoretical challenges in compressible Navier-Stokes simulations. We present the novel Delayed-Time Domain Impedance Boundary Condition (D-TDIBC) technique developed to impose a time delay to acoustic wave reflection. Unlike previous similar TDIBC derivations (Fung and Ju, 2001-2004 [1,2], Scalo et al., 2015 [3] and Lin et al., 2016 [4]), D-TDIBC relies on the modeling of the reflection coefficient. An iterative fit is used to determine the model constants along with a low-pass filtering strategy to limit the model to the frequency range of interest. D-TDIBC can be used to truncate portions of the domain by introducing a time delay in the acoustic response of the boundary accounting for the travel time of inviscid planar acoustic waves in the truncated sections: it gives the opportunity to save computational resources and to study several geometries without the need to regenerate computational grids. The D-TDIBC method is applied here to time-delayed fully reflective conditions. D-TDIBC simulations of inviscid planar acoustic-wave propagating in truncated ducts demonstrate that the time delay is correctly reproduced, preserving wave amplitude and phase. A 2D thermoacoustically unstable combustion setup is used as a final test case: Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of an unstable laminar flame is performed using a reduced domain along with D-TDIBC to model the truncated portion. Results are in excellent agreement with the same calculation performed over the full domain. The unstable modes frequencies, amplitudes and shapes are accurately predicted.

AB The fluid-solid interaction (FSI) problem is customarily solved by starting with the fluid dynamics component. One chooses an established computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and subsequently embeds the solid phase dynamics within the CFD solution leading to either a monolithic or a staggered/co-simulated solution. The approach discussed here takes the opposite tack. We start with a differential variational framework to handle the solid phase; i.e., the multi-body dynamics problem in the presence of contact, friction, and bilateral kinematic constraints. The dynamics of the fluid phase, which is captured via smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), is subsequently embedded into this framework in which the incompressibility attribute of the flow is enforced via kinematic constraint equations that involve SPH particles. The resulting monolithic FSI solution methodology relies on a half-implicit symplectic time integration method that uses a matrix-free iterative approach to solve a cone constrained quadratic optimization problem at each time step. This problem yields the contact forces, friction forces, boundary condition Lagrange multipliers, fluid-solid coupling terms, and bilateral constraint Lagrange multipliers. The solution of the optimization problem represents the computationally taxing component of the method. Large integration time steps, tight enforcement of incompressibility, a unified approach for handling the fluid and solid phases, and linear scaling are listed as the attractive attributes of the proposed method. The numerical experiments reported include three validation studies (incompressibility, dam break, and sloshing), a scaling analysis, and a tracked vehicle fording simulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ID TRANSITION; VORTEX; FLOWS; LAYER
AB The use of an artificial bulk viscosity for shock stabilization is a common approach employed in turbulence simulations with high-order numerics. The effect of the artificial bulk viscosity is analyzed in the context of large eddy simulations by using as a test case simulations of linearly-forced compressible homogeneous turbulence (Petersen and Livescu, 2010 [12]). This case is unique in that it allows for the specification of a priori target values for total dissipation and ratio of solenoidal to dilatational dissipation. A comparison between these target values and the true predicted levels of dissipation is thus used to investigate the performance of the artificial bulk viscosity. Results show that the artificial bulk viscosity is effective at achieving stable solutions, but also leads to large values of artificial dissipation that outweigh the physical dissipation caused by fluid viscosity. An alternate approach, which employs the artificial thermal conductivity only, shows that the dissipation of dilatational modes is entirely due to the fluid viscosity. However, this method leads to unwanted Gibbs oscillations around the shocklets. The use of shock sensors that further localize the artificial bulk viscosity did not reduce the amount of artificial dissipation introduced by the artificial bulk viscosity. Finally, an improved forcing function that explicitly accounts for the role of the artificial bulk viscosity in the budget of turbulent kinetic energy was explored. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Compressive sampling has become a widely used approach to construct polynomial chaos surrogates when the number of available simulation samples is limited. Originally, these expensive simulation samples would be obtained at random locations in the parameter space. It was later shown that the choice of sample locations could significantly impact the accuracy of resulting surrogates. This motivated new sampling strategies or designof-experiment approaches, such as coherence-optimal sampling, which aim at improving the coherence property. In this paper, we propose a sampling strategy that can identify near-optimal sample locations that lead to improvement in local-coherence property and also enhancement of cross-correlation properties of measurement matrices. We provide theoretical motivations for the proposed sampling strategy along with several numerical examples that show that our near-optimal sampling strategy produces substantially more accurate results, compared to other sampling strategies.

AB In this paper, a new cell-centered positivity-preserving pyramid scheme (called P-3-scheme) is proposed for anisotropic diffusion problems. It can be regarded as a development of the O-scheme [31] for general hexahedral meshes with nonplanar cell-faces. In the P-3-scheme, the flux on the nonplanar cell-face is approximated by the so called effective directional flux. Compared with the O-scheme, the P-3-scheme is much more robust with respect to the distortion of the meshes, and has lower cost in computation and storage. Being different from the P-scheme [32], the P-3-scheme is positivity-preserving and can be applied to anisotropic diffusion problems. Numerical results are presented to show the performance of P-3-scheme on various kinds of distorted meshes for problems with continuous and discontinuous diffusion coefficients.

AB In this paper we study the performances of generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) preconditioned with geometric multigrid (GMG), applied to steady and unsteady buoyancy driven flow problems, discretized with the finite element method. For the unsteady case, the second order Crank-Nicolson method is used for the temporal discretization. At each geometric multigrid level, we use Richardson iterative solvers preconditioned with different combinations of physics-based and domain decomposition preconditioners. Three different preconditioners are considered: incomplete LU decomposition (ILU), overlapping Vanka-type domain decomposition for additive Schwarz method (ASM), and field split (FS) physics-based decomposition. We also analyze the effect on the smoother of how the variables are ordered, and in particular whether the leading variable is the velocity or the temperature, resulting in six classes of preconditioners: ILU_VT, ILU_TV, ASM_VT, ASM_TV, FS_VT and FS_TV. The eigenvalue analysis for the six preconditioners is conducted to study the rate of GMRES convergence under several Prandtl numbers. The numerical performances of nested combinations of the above preconditioners are compared. Numerical results show that the pair of FS_VT and FS_TV preconditioners works better than the other two pairs, and that the FS_TV preconditioner always performs the best in terms of the computational time for all the steady and unsteady cases.

AB We propose a hybrid approach to solve the high-frequency Helmholtz equation with point source terms in smooth heterogeneous media. The method is based on the ray-based finite element method (ray-FEM) [29], whose original version can not handle the singularity close to point sources accurately. This pitfall is addressed by combining the ray-FEM, which is used to compute the smooth far-field of the solution accurately, with a high- order asymptotic expansion close to the point source, which is used to properly capture the singularity of the solution in the near-field. The method requires a fixed number of grid points per wavelength to accurately represent the wave field with an asymptotic convergence rate of O(omega(-1/2)), where omega is the frequency parameter in the Helmholtz equation. In addition, a fast sweeping-type preconditioner is used to solve the resulting linear system.
   We present numerical examples in 2D to show both accuracy and efficiency of our method as the frequency increases. In particular, we provide numerical evidence of the convergence rate, and we show empirically that the overall complexity is O(omega(2)) up to a poly-logarithmic factor. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This work proposes a method for model reduction of finite-volume models that guarantees the resulting reduced-order model is conservative, thereby preserving the structure intrinsic to finite-volume discretizations. The proposed reduced-order models associate with optimization problems characterized by a minimum-residual objective function and nonlinear equality constraints that explicitly enforce conservation over subdomains. Conservative Galerkin projection arises from formulating this optimization problem at the time-continuous level, while conservative least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) projection associates with a time-discrete formulation. We equip these approaches with hyper-reduction techniques in the case of nonlinear flux and source terms, and also provide approaches for handling infeasibility. In addition, we perform analyses that include deriving conditions under which conservative Galerkin and conservative LSPG are equivalent, as well as deriving a posteriori error bounds. Numerical experiments performed on a parameterized quasi-1D Euler equation demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to ensure not only global conservation, but also significantly lower state-space errors than nonconservative reduced-order models such as standard Galerkin and LSPG projection.

AB A particular mix of integral equations and discretization techniques is suggested for the solution of a planar Helmholtz transmission problem with relevance to the study of surface plasmon waves. The transmission problem describes the scattering of a timeharmonic transverse magnetic wave from an infinite dielectric cylinder with complex permittivity and sharp edges. Numerical examples illustrate that the resulting scheme is capable of obtaining total magnetic and electric fields to very high accuracy in the entire computational domain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The immersed boundary method is a mathematical formulation and numerical method for solving fluid-structure interaction problems. For many biological problems, such as models that include the cell membrane, the immersed structure is a two-dimensional infinitely thin elastic shell immersed in an incompressible viscous fluid. When the shell is modeled as a hyperelastic material, forces can be computed by taking the variational derivative of an energy density functional. A new method for computing a continuous force function on the entire surface of the shell is presented here. The new method is compared to a previous formulation where the surface and energy functional are discretized before forces are computed. For the case of Stokes flow, a method for computing quadrature weights is provided to ensure the integral of the elastic spread force density remains zero throughout a dynamic simulation. Tests on the method are conducted and show that it yields more accurate force computations than previous formulations as well as more accurate geometric information such as mean curvature. The method is then applied to a model of a red blood cell in capillary flow and a 3D model of cellular blebbing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID RANDOMIZED KACZMARZ ALGORITHM
AB We present a sequential method for approximating an unknown function sequentially using random noisy samples. Unlike the traditional function approximation methods, the current method constructs the approximation using one sample at a time. This results in a simple numerical implementation using only vector operations and avoids the need to store the entire data set. The method is thus particularly suitable when data set is exceedingly large. Furthermore, we present a general theoretical framework to define and interpret the method. Both upper and lower bounds of the method are established for the expectation of the results. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical findings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) of advection-dominated contaminant transport in a coupled Darcy-Stokes flow system is described. In particular, we focus on high-dimensional epistemic uncertainty due to an unknown permeability field in the Darcy domain that is modelled as a lognormal random field. This paper explores different numerical strategies for the subproblems and suggests an optimal combination for the MLMC estimator. We propose a specific monolithic multigrid algorithm to efficiently solve the steady-state Darcy-Stokes flow with a highly heterogeneous diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, we describe an Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) based time-stepping for the flux-limited quadratic upwinding discretization for the transport problem. Numerical experiments illustrating the multigrid convergence and cost of the MLMC estimator with respect to the smoothness of permeability field are presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new hybrid N-S/DSMC-IP approach based on adaptive structured/unstructured overlap- ping grids is proposed and implemented to simulate hypersonic transitional flows. This approach uses the N-S method based on structured grids and the DSMC-IP method based on unstructured grids in the simulation of continuum and rarefied flow fields. The adaptive overlapping grid method is utilized and the interface between the continuum and rarefied regions is partitioned using Kn(GL) number. The information in the different regions is strongly coupled to the continuum/rarefied interface, and the values in the coupling cells are interpolated with the weight coefficients. Finally, an adaptive parallel strategy is proposed to further improve computational efficiency. This hybrid approach combines the advantages of the structured grid and unstructured grid methods, meaning it can investigate the various characteristics of transitional flow fields with high efficiency and accuracy, while also enhancing the approach's fitness. This hybrid approach is implemented to simulate the continuum/rarefied hypersonic transitional flows around a cylinder and a nozzle; with the results indicating that the computational speed for this hybrid approach is much higher than for the DSMC-IP method and that it can be used to investigate variation in the characteristics of continuum/rarefied regions in transitional flows. Therefore, it is an efficient algorithm for the investigation of hypersonic transitional flows. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Meta- (or surrogate-) models constructed from meso-scale simulations can be used in place of empirical correlations to close macro-scale equations. In shocked particulate flows, surrogate models for drag are constructed as functions of shock Mach number (Ma), particle volume fraction (phi), Reynolds number (Re), etc. The computational cost of the high-fidelity meso-scale simulations is a challenge in construction of surrogates in such hierarchical multi-scale frameworks. Here multifidelity surrogate-modeling techniques are evaluated as inexpensive alternatives to high-fidelity surrogate models for obtaining closure laws for drag in shock-particle interactions. Preliminary surrogates for drag as a function of Ma and phi are constructed from ensembles of low-fidelity (coarse grid) mesoscale computations. The low-fidelity surrogates are subsequently corrected using only a few (N-hf) high-fidelity computations to obtain multifidelity surrogate models. The paper evaluates three different methods for correcting an initial low-fidelity surrogate; Space Mapping (SM), Radial Basis Functions (RBF) and Modified Bayesian Kriging (MBKG). Of these methods, MBKG is found to provide the best multi-fidelity surrogate model, simultaneously minimizing the computational cost and error in the constructed surrogate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We develop a new high-order method for Eulerian simulations of solids undergoing large, elastic-plastic deformations. Thermodynamically consistent constitutive relations of classical hyperelasticity are used to describe the behavior of solids, liquids and gases in a unified manner. Two kinematic formulations, one based on the inverse deformation gradient tensor, and a second based on the symmetric Finger tensor, are used for tracking large deformations in solids. Simulations based on the Finger tensor are shown to be equivalent to those using the full inverse deformation gradient tensor at much lower computational expense. The numerical algorithm employs a 10th-order compact finite-difference scheme for spatial discretization and a 4th-order Runge-Kutta time-stepping scheme. An improved form of the Localized Artificial Diffusivity (LAD) method is used for numerical regularization of shocks and contact discontinuities. We show that this high-order numerical framework, previously used for simulations of fluid flows, is suitable for problems involving large deformations in elastic-plastic solids as well. Particular emphasis is laid on the choice of the artificial diffusivity parameters in order to sufficiently capture shocks and discontinuities in all the aforementioned continuum media with minimal added dissipation. Test cases in one and two dimensions are shown to demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach. In particular, this choice of algorithms is shown to lead to excellent numerical resolution properties, and to preserve mass-consistency and curl/compatibility constraints with high order of accuracy. Potential extensions of this numerical framework include application to multi-material problems, involving compressible flow of fluids coupled to elastic-plastic deformations in solids, that are of significant engineering interest.

AB In the strong scaling limit, the performance of conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for the parallel solution of PDEs saturates. When sub-domains become small, halo-communication and other overhead come to dominate. A potential path beyond this scaling limit is to introduce domain-decomposition in time, with one such popular approach being the Parareal algorithm which has received a lot of attention due to its generality and potential scalability. Low efficiency, particularly on convection dominated problems, has however limited the adoption of the method. In this paper we demonstrate trough large-scale numerical experiments that it is possible not only to obtain time-parallel speedup on the non-linear shallow water wave equation, but also that we may obtain parallel acceleration beyond what is possible using conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques alone. Two factors were essential in achieving this. First, for Parareal to converge on the hyperbolic problem we used an approximate Riemann solver as the preconditioner. This preconditioner introduces only dissipative errors with respect to the 3rd order accurate WENO-RK discretization used to solve the PDE system. The preconditoner is comparatively expensive and convergence is slow unless time-subdomains are short. We therefore introduce a new scheduler that we denote Communication Aware Adaptive Parareal (CAAP). CAAP increases obtainable speed-up by minimizing the time-subdomain length without making communication of time-subdomains too costly whilst also adaptively overlapping consecutive cycles of Parareal so to mitigate the impact of a relatively expensive coarse operator.

AB Computing statistical quantities of interest of the solution of partial differential equations on random domains is an important and challenging task in engineering. We consider the computation of these quantities by the perturbation approach. Especially, we discuss how third order accurate expansions of the mean and the correlation can numerically be computed. These expansions become even fourth order accurate for certain types of boundary variations. The correction terms are given by the solution of correlation equations in the tensor product domain, which can efficiently be computed by means of H-matrices. They have recently been shown to be an efficient tool to solve correlation equations with rough data correlations, that is, with low Sobolev smoothness or small correlation length, in almost linear time. Numerical experiments in three dimensions for higher order ansatz spaces show the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The application to a non-smooth domain is also included.

AB Efficient higher order interpolation schemes based on a multi-dimensional optimal order detection (MOOD) paradigm are developed coupled with the implicit time discretization scheme and further investigated for implicit large eddy simulation of compressible turbulence. The developed methodology utilizes higher-order either the upwind or the central interpolation to minimize numerical dissipation and meantime hybridizes shock capturing scheme that is also provided with higher-order interpolation to stabilize the solution. Simple and effective technique is proposed to apply the current method to an unsteady dual-time stepping scheme, which is to the best of the authors' knowledge the first time to develop the strategy for the MOOD application within an unsteady implicit time discretization framework. The resulting schemes are implemented in the simplified finite volume method that is constructed on non-uniform, curvilinear, multiblock structured grids. Numerical results for a comprehensive suite of both benchmark and practical problems demonstrate that the designed schemes simultaneously obtain the well-resolved broadband turbulence and the sharp shock profiles with considerable reduction in the computation cost.

AB Direct numerical simulations (DNS) indicate that at large values of the Rayleigh number (Ra) convection in porous media self-organizes into narrowly-spaced columnar flows, with more complex spatiotemporal features being confined to boundary layers near the top and bottom walls. In this investigation of high-Ra porous media convection in a minimal flow unit, two reduced modeling strategies are proposed that exploit these specific flow characteristics. Both approaches utilize the idea of decomposition since the flow exhibits different dynamics in different regions of the domain: small-scale cellular motions generally are localized within the thermal and vorticity boundary layers near the upper and lower walls, while in the interior, the flow exhibits persistent large-scale structures and only a few low (horizontal) wavenumber Fourier modes are active. Accordingly, in the first strategy, the domain is decomposed into two near-wall regions and one interior region. Our results confirm that suppressing the interior high-wavenumber modes has negligible impact on the essential structural features and transport properties of the flow. In the second strategy, a hybrid reduced model is constructed by using Galerkin projection onto a fully a priori eigenbasis drawn from energy stability and upper bound theory, thereby extending the model reduction strategy developed by Chini et al. (2011) [45] to large Ra. The results indicate that the near-wall upper-bound eigenmodes can economically represent the small-scale rolls within the exquisitely-thin thermal boundary layers. Relative to DNS, the hybrid algorithm enables over an order-of-magnitude increase in computational efficiency with only a modest loss of accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a method to obtain optimal RBF-FD formulas which maximize their frequency range of validity. The optimization is based on the idea of keeping an error of interest (dispersion, phase or group velocity errors) below a given threshold for a wavenumber interval as large as possible. To find the weights of these optimal finite difference formulas we solve an optimization problem. In a previous work we developed a method to optimize the frequency range of validity for finite difference weights. That method required to solve a system of nonlinear equations with as many unknowns as half of the number of weights, which is a very hard task when the number of nodes gets large. The current method requires solving an optimization problem with only one parameter, which makes finding a global minimum easier, and thus can be used for bigger stencils. We also study which of the standard RBF are more appropriate for this problem and introduce a new RBF that depends on two parameters. This new RBF improves the resulting frequency response of the RBF-FD methods while keeping the cost of the optimization problem low. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider a diffuse-interface gas-liquid two-phase flow model with inhomogeneous temperatures, in which we employ the Peng-Robinson equation of state and the temperature-dependent influence parameter instead of the van der Waals equation of state and the constant influence parameter used in the existing models. As a result, our model can characterize accurately the physical behaviors of numerous realistic gas-liquid fluids, especially hydrocarbons. Furthermore, we prove a relation associating the pressure gradient with the gradients of temperature and chemical potential, thereby deriving a new formulation of the momentum balance equation, which shows that gradients of the chemical potential and temperature become the primary driving force of the fluid motion. It is rigorously proved that the new formulations of the model obey the first and second laws of thermodynamics. To design efficient numerical methods, we prove that Helmholtz free energy density is a concave function with respect to the temperature under certain physical conditions. Based on the proposed modeling formulations and the convex-concave splitting of Helmholtz free energy density, we propose a novel thermodynamically stable numerical scheme. We rigorously prove that the proposed method satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, numerical tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed simulation method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) based on clustering algorithm to study the elliptic PDEs with random coefficients in the multi-query setting. Our method consists of offline and online stages. In the offline stage, we construct a small number of reduced basis functions within each coarse grid block, which can then be used to approximate the multiscale finite element basis functions. In addition, we coarsen the corresponding random space through a clustering algorithm. In the online stage, we can obtain the multiscale finite element basis very efficiently on a coarse grid by using the precomputed multiscale basis. The new GMsFEM can be applied to multiscale SPDE starting with a relatively coarse grid, without requiring the coarsest grid to resolve the smallest-scale of the solution. The new method offers considerable savings in solving multiscale SPDEs. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for several multiscale stochastic problems without scale separation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We consider computing the k-th eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of a generalized Hermitian eigenvalue problem of n x n large sparse matrices. In electronic structure calculations, several properties of materials, such as those of optoelectronic device materials, are governed by the eigenpair with a material-specific index k. We present a three-stage algorithm for computing the k-th eigenpair with validation of its index. In the first stage of the algorithm, we propose an efficient way of finding an interval containing the k-th eigenvalue (1 << k << n) with a non-standard application of the Lanczos method. In the second stage, spectral bisection for large-scale problems is realized using a sparse direct linear solver to narrow down the interval of the k-th eigenvalue. In the third stage, we switch to a modified shift-and-invert Lanczos method to reduce bisection iterations and compute the k-th eigenpair with validation. Numerical results with problem sizes up to 1.5 million are reported, and the results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the three-stage algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID PROPAGATION
AB The linearized, compressible Navier-Stokes equations can be used to model acoustic wave propagation in the presence of viscous and thermal boundary layers. However, acoustic boundary layers are notorious for invoking prohibitively high resolution requirements on numerical solutions of the equations. We derive and present a strategy for how viscous and thermal boundary-layer effects can be represented as a boundary condition on the standard Helmholtz equation for the acoustic pressure. This boundary condition constitutes an O (delta) perturbation, where delta is the boundary-layer thickness, of the vanishing Neumann condition for the acoustic pressure associated with a lossless sound-hard wall. The approximate model is valid when the wavelength and the minimum radius of curvature of the wall is much larger than the boundary layer thickness. In the special case of sound propagation in a cylindrical duct, the model collapses to the classical Kirchhoff solution. We assess the model in the case of sound propagation through a compression driver, a kind of transducer that is commonly used to feed horn loudspeakers. Due to the presence of shallow chambers and thin slits in the device, it is crucial to include modeling of visco-thermal losses in the acoustic analysis. The transmitted power spectrum through the device calculated numerically using our model agrees well with computations using a hybrid model, where the full linearized, compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved in the narrow regions of the device and the inviscid Helmholtz equations elsewhere. However, our model needs about two orders of magnitude less memory and computational time than the more complete model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spectral methods are becoming increasingly prevalent in solving time-varying partial differential equations due to their fast convergence properties. However, they typically use regular computational meshes that do not account for spatially varying resolution requirements. This can significantly increase the overall grid density when resolution requirements vary sharply over the modelled domain. Moving mesh methods offer a remedy for this, by allowing the position of mesh nodes to adapt to the simulated model solution. In this paper, a mesh specification is presented that is based on a local measure of the spatial bandwidth of the model solution. This addresses the rate of decay of the model solution's frequency components by producing high-sampling rates when this decay is slow. The spatial bandwidth is computed using a combination of the original solution and its Riesz transformed counterparts. It is then integrated into a Fourier spectral moving mesh method, using the parabolic Monge-Ampere equation for mesh control. This method is used to solve a multidimensional version of the viscous Burgers equation, and a heterogeneous advection equation. The performance of bandwidth-based mesh adaptation is compared with arclength- and curvature-based adaptation, and against a static mesh. These numerical experiments show that the bandwidth-based approach produces superior convergence rates, and hence requires fewer mesh nodes for a given level of solution accuracy.

AB We formulate hydrodynamic equations and spectrally accurate numerical methods for investigating the role of geometry in flows within two-dimensional fluid interfaces. To achieve numerical approximations having high precision and level of symmetry for radial manifold shapes, we develop spectral Galerkin methods based on hyperinterpolation with Lebedev quadratures for L-2-projection to spherical harmonics. We demonstrate our methods by investigating hydrodynamic responses as the surface geometry is varied. Relative to the case of a sphere, we find significant changes can occur in the observed hydrodynamic flow responses as exhibited by quantitative and topological transitions in the structure of the flow. We present numerical results based on the Rayleigh-Dissipation principle to gain further insights into these flow responses. We investigate the roles played by the geometry especially concerning the positive and negative Gaussian curvature of the interface. We provide general approaches for taking geometric effects into account for investigations of hydrodynamic phenomena within curved fluid interfaces. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Sequential Fully Implicit (SFI) method was proposed [12], in the context of a Multiscale Finite Volume (MSFV) formulation, to simulate coupled immiscible multiphase fluid flow in porous media. Later, Lee et al. [15] extended the SFI formulation to the black-oil model, whereby the gas component is allowed to dissolve in the oil phase. Most recently, the SFI approach was extended to fully compositional isothermal displacements by Moncorge et al. [21]. SFI schemes solve the fully coupled system in two steps: (1) Construct and solve the pressure equation (flow problem). (2) Solve the coupled species transport equations for the phase saturations and phase compositions. In SFI, each outer iteration involves this two-step sequence. Experience indicates that complex interphase mass transfer behaviors often lead to large numbers of SFI outer iterations compared with the Fully Implicit (FI) method. Here, we demonstrate that the convergence difficulties are directly related to the treatment of the coupling between the flow and transport problems, and we propose a new SFI variant based on a nonlinear overall-volume balance equation. The first step consists of forming and solving a nonlinear pressure equation, which is a weighted sum of all the component mass conservation equations. A Newton-based scheme is used to iterate out all the pressure dependent nonlinearities in both the accumulation and flux terms of the overall-volume balance equation. The resulting pressure field is used to compute the Darcy phase velocities and the total-velocity. The second step of the new SFI scheme entails introducing the overall-mass density as a degree-of-freedom, and solving the full set of component conservation equations cast in the natural-variables form (i.e., saturations and phase compositions). During the second step, the pressure and the total-velocity fields are fixed. The SFI scheme with a nonlinear pressure extends the SFI approach of Jenny et al. [12] to multi-component compositional processes with interphase mass transfer. The proposed compositional SFI approach employs an overall balance for the pressure equation; however, unlike existing volume-balance Sequential Implicit (SI) schemes [1,34,32,27,10,9] which use overall compositions, this SFI formulation is well suited for the natural variables (saturations and phase compositions). We analyze the 'splitting errors' associated with the compositional SFI scheme, and we show how to control these errors in order to converge to the same solution as the Fully Implicit (FI) method. We then demonstrate that the compositional SFI has convergence properties that are very comparable to those of the FI approach. This robust sequential-implicit solution scheme allows for designing numerical methods and linear solvers that are optimized for the sub-problems of flow and transport. The SFI scheme with a nonlinear pressure formulation is well suited for multiscale formulations, and it promises to replace the widely used FI approach for compositional reservoir simulation.

AB In this article, a numerical method to compute the electrostatic interaction energy and forces between many dielectric particles is presented. The computational method is based on a Galerkin approximation of an integral equation formulation, which is sufficiently general, as it is able to treat systems embedded in a homogeneous dielectric medium containing an arbitrary number of spherical particles of arbitrary size, charge, dielectric constant and position in the three-dimensional space. The algorithmic complexity is linear scaling with respect to the number of particles for the computation of the energy which has been achieved through the use of a modified fast multipole method. The method scales with the third power of the degree of spherical harmonics used in the underlying expansions, for general three-dimensional particle configurations. Several simple numerical examples illustrate the capabilities of the model, and the influence of mutual polarization between particles in an electrostatic interaction is discussed.

AB The presence of a high-dimensional stochastic input domain with discontinuities poses major computational challenges in analyzing and quantifying the effects of the uncertainties in a physical system. In this paper, we propose a stochastic collocation method with adaptive mesh refinement (SCAMR) to deal with high dimensional stochastic systems with discontinuities. Specifically, the proposed approach uses generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion with Legendre polynomial basis and solves for the gPC coefficients using the least squares method. It also implements an adaptive mesh (element) refinement strategy which checks for abrupt variations in the output based on a low-order gPC approximation error to track discontinuities or non-smoothness. In addition, the proposed method involves a criterion for checking possible dimensionality reduction and consequently, the decomposition of the original high-dimensional problem to a number of lower-dimensional subproblems. Specifically, this criterion checks all the existing interactions between input parameters of a specific problem based on the high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) method, and therefore automatically provides the subproblems which only involve interacting input parameters. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated using examples of both smooth and non-smooth problems with number of input parameters up to 500, and the approach is compared against other existing algorithms.

AB A computational framework for interface-resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) of simultaneous atomization, evaporation and combustion process is proposed. The present work utilizes a level set method to implicitly capture the gas-liquid interface and the ghost fluid method (GFM) to accurately address jump conditions across the interface. Specific care has been devoted to the discretization of the convective term and diffusive term for the species and energy equations. The level set method with a sub-cell resolution of the interface is employed and a semi-Lagrangian scheme for the discretization of the level set equation with an evaporation source term is proposed. The one-step global reaction model of n-heptane is used for the vapor combustion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational framework that has the capability to simulate spray combustion with an interface-resolved method. The present framework has been validated in several cases, including the one-dimensional evaporation and the static droplet evaporation for low ambient temperature, the Stefan problem, the Sucking problem, the evaporation of static and moving droplet for high ambient temperature, and the combustion of static and moving droplet. Finally, the integrated simulation of droplet collision and combustion is performed to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the present method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we study the dispersion properties of two compatible Galerkin schemes for the 1D linearized shallow water equations: the P-n(C) - P-n-1(DG) and the GD(n) - DGD(n-1) element pairs. P-n is the order n Lagrange space, P-n-1(DG) is the order n - 1 discontinuous Lagrange space, GD(n) is the order n Galerkin difference space, and DGD(n-1) is the order n - 1 discontinuous Galerkin difference space. Compatible Galerkin methods have many desirable properties, including energy conservation, steady geostrophic modes and the absence of spurious stationary modes, such as pressure modes. However, this does not guarantee good wave dispersion properties. Previous work on the P-2(C) - P-1(DG) pair has indeed indicated the presence of spectral gaps, and it is extended in this paper to the study of the P-n(C) - P-n-1(DG) pair for arbitrary n. Additionally, an alternative element pair is introduced, the GD(n) - DGD(n-1) pair, that is free of spectral gaps while benefiting from the desirable properties of compatible elements. Asymptotic convergence rates are established for both element pairs, including the use of inexact quadrature (which diagonalizes the velocity mass matrix) for the P-n(C) - P-n-1(DG) pair and reduced quadrature for the GD(n) - DGD(n-1) pair. Plots of the dispersion relationship and group velocities for a wide range of n and Rossby radii are shown. A brief investigation into the utility of mass lumping to remove the spectral gaps for the P-3(C) - P-2(DG) pair is performed. Finally, a pair of numerical simulations are run to investigate the consequences of the spectral gaps and highlight the main differences between the two elements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper considers a dense imploding spherical shell, where perturbations on the inner surface grow due to hydrodynamic instabilities, geometric convergence and compression. A low-convergence implosion with a single spherical harmonic mode perturbation with mode numbers in the range from l = 5 to l = 100 and at three different amplitudes is considered. The linear theory of Epstein [1] is extended to incorporate reshock, making it applicable to the full implosion process (while perturbations are linear). Linear theory is employed to choose modes such that quantified geometric convergence and compression effects contribute significantly to perturbation growth at the lower mode number, while at the higher mode number the contribution from Rayleigh-Taylor instability dominates. Simulation results from four independent simulation codes (FLASH, HYDRA, Miranda and Flamenco) are presented. The simulation predictions are validated against linear theory pre-reshock and employed to validate the extended theory across the reshock. The simulations continue to substantially non-linear perturbation amplitudes, beyond the limits of the analytical approach, and the presented perturbation amplitudes can inform future non-linear modeling. The simulated perturbation amplitudes agree to within approximately 10% for most cases, with isolated cases having differences of greater than 50% from the simulated ensemble-mean. This occurs in the case of a low mode number perturbation with a very small amplitude, where the growth of secondary small-scale instabilities leads to substantial differences between the codes after re-shock.

AB Although interpolation-based finite difference methods have shown great success in the simulation of complex configurations, the schemes currently are still inappropriate in many circumstances due to their poor spectral properties. In this paper, a class of optimized low-dissipation and low-dispersion schemes is developed with the cell-centered finite difference method (Liao, J. Comput. Phys., 284:419-433, 2015). Firstly, the linear schemes with two free parameters which dominate the dispersion and dissipation properties independently are derived. Secondly, the two free parameters are optimized separately according to specific criteria to obtain the optimized linear schemes. Thirdly, for shock-capturing capability, the optimized non-linear schemes are acquired from the optimized linear schemes using the multi-stencil weighting technique. Meanwhile, a new series of weighting functions and smoothness indicators are derived following the idea of Hu (Hu, J. Comput. Phys., 229:8952-8965, 2010) for the optimized non-linear schemes. Finally, several benchmark cases are validated with the developed optimized linear and nonlinear schemes. In flows with shocks, the optimized non-linear schemes can give more flow details than the non-linear reference schemes without noticeable robustness loss. In the low-speed problems, the optimized linear schemes perform much better than the corresponding upwind linear schemes. Additionally, satisfactory results are observed on the wavy grid, indicating the optimized schemes with cell-centered finite difference method are promising. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Shen et al. [1,2] proposed an upwind space-time conservation element and solution element (CESE) scheme for 1D and 2D hydrodynamics (HD) in rectangular coordinates, which combined the advantages of CESE and upwind scheme, namely, guaranteed strictly the space-time conservation law as well as captured discontinuities very efficiently. All kinds of upwind schemes can be combined very flexibly for different problems to achieve the perfect combination of CESE and finite volume method (FVM). However, in many physical applications, we need to consider geometries that are more sophisticated. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to extend the upwind CESE scheme to multidimensional magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) in general curvilinear coordinates by transforming the MHD equations from the physical domain (general curvilinear coordinates) to the computational domain (rectangular coordinates) and the new equations in the computational domain can be still written in the conservation form. For the 3D case, the derivations of some formulas are much more abstract and complex in a 4D Euclidean hyperspace, and some technical problems need to be solved in the debugging process. Unlike in HD, keeping the magnetic field divergence-free for MHD problems is also a challenge especially in general curvilinear coordinates. These are the main obstacles we have overcome in this study. The test results of benchmarks demonstrate that we have successfully extended the upwind CESE scheme to general curvilinear coordinates for both 2D and 3D MHD problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This article describes a new numerical scheme to model surface tension for an interface represented by a level-set function. In contrast with previous schemes, the method conserves fluid momentum and recovers Laplace's equilibrium exactly. It is formally consistent and does not require the introduction of an arbitrary interface thickness, as is classically done when approximating surface-to-volume operators using Dirac functions. Variable surface tension is naturally taken into account by the scheme and accurate solutions are obtained for thermocapillary flows. Application to the Marangoni breakup of an axisymmetric droplet shows that the method is robust also in the case of changes in the interface topology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present in this work a new reconstruction scheme, so-called MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme, to solve the five-equation model for interfacial two phase flows. This scheme employs the traditional shock capturing MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Law) scheme as well as the interface sharpening THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) scheme as two building-blocks of spatial reconstruction on the BVD (boundary variation diminishing) principle that minimizes the variations (jumps) of the reconstructed variables at cell boundaries, and thus effectively reduces the dissipation error in numerical solutions. The MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme is implemented to the volume fraction and other state variables under the same finite volume framework, which realizes the consistency among volume fraction and other physical variables. Numerical results of benchmark tests show that the present method is able to capture the material interface as a well-defined sharp jump in volume fraction, and obtain numerical solutions of superior quality in comparison to other existing methods. The proposed scheme is a simple and effective method of practical significance for simulating compressible interfacial multiphase flows. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multiple advancements of the dimensionally un-split, flux-based geometrical Volume-of-Fluid method on unstructured meshes are proposed. A second-order accurate interface reconstruction algorithm for both two-and-three dimensions is developed on unstructured hexahedral meshes. A new triangulation algorithm is developed that results in an absolute increase in accuracy and can be directly applied to other geometrical Volume-of-Fluid methods on both structured and unstructured meshes. A second-order accurate interpolation of point displacements is proposed for unstructured meshes. A global parallel error re-distribution algorithm is developed, with no negative effects on the L-1 error convergence and computational costs. All algorithms are parallelized using the message passing parallel programming model, with a minimal parallel communication overhead. The results show L-1 errors to be exactly numerically bounded, second-order convergent and lower than the errors reported for other contemporary methods, volume conservation that is near machine tolerance, as well as execution times comparable to those of methods developed on structured Cartesian meshes, regardless of the increased algorithmic complexity introduced by the connectivity of unstructured meshes.

AB We present a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian method to simulate cloud cavitation in a compressible liquid. The method is designed to capture the strong, volumetric oscillations of each bubble and the bubble-scattered acoustics. The dynamics of the bubbly mixture is formulated using volume-averaged equations of motion. The continuous phase is discretized on an Eulerian grid and integrated using a high-order, finite-volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme, while the gas phase is modeled as spherical, Lagrangian point-bubbles at the sub-grid scale, each of whose radial evolution is tracked by solving the Keller-Miksis equation. The volume of bubbles is mapped onto the Eulerian grid as the void fraction by using a regularization (smearing) kernel. In the most general case, where the bubble distribution is arbitrary, three-dimensional Cartesian grids are used for spatial discretization. In order to reduce the computational cost for problems possessing translational or rotational homogeneities, we spatially average the governing equations along the direction of symmetry and discretize the continuous phase on two-dimensional or axi-symmetric grids, respectively. We specify a regularization kernel that maps the three-dimensional distribution of bubbles onto the field of an averaged two-dimensional or axi-symmetric void fraction. A closure is developed to model the pressure fluctuations at the sub-grid scale as synthetic noise. For the examples considered here, modeling the sub-grid pressure fluctuations as white noise agrees a priori with computed distributions from three-dimensional simulations, and suffices, a posteriori, to accurately reproduce the statistics of the bubble dynamics. The numerical method and its verification are described by considering test cases of the dynamics of a single bubble and cloud cavitation induced by ultrasound fields. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB With increasing amount of trajectory dataset being generated and collected, trajectory data has become a ubiquitous type of data important in many different application domains. Research challenges faced are to analyse and retrieve useful higher order information from trajectory datasets to deal with dynamic and "what-if" complex decision making problems. In this paper, we propose a new visualisation approach and quantitative metrics to model and analyse topological higher order information from trajectory datasets. The proposed higher order DNA chart can help decision makers to compare different topological higher order information from different trajectories. We also define higher order trajectory area that models a geometrical area representing the same higher order information. We introduce a higher order DNA impact factor that defines top-k higher order information, and the relationship between trajectory datasets and points-of-interest. A case study using trajectory data extracted from Flickr illustrates the applicability and usefulness of these proposed visual tools and metrics. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is an important preprocessing step in supervised learning. It involves reducing/mapping of high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space by preserving important information. The classical DR paradigm can be divided into Feature Selection (FS) and Feature Extraction (FE) approaches. So far, these approaches have been studied extensively but independently and the reduced set contains either original or transformed features. And, it is well known that FS and FE approaches based on information theoretic measures are considered to be the most effective approaches as these measures are able to compare the nonlinear relationships between random variables. Herein, we present a novel scheme to generate reduced compound (both original and transformed) feature set based on such measures in supervised learning. This method considers information theoretic measure Mutual Information (MI) and MI based interactions between features and it is able to produce maximum informative and less redundant compound features. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art DR methods using multiple classifiers on UCI machine learning repository and face and object recognition and bio-microarray data sets.

AB Feature selection is very important for pattern recognition to reduce the dimensions of data and to improve the efficiency of learning algorithms. Recent research on new approaches has focused mostly on improving accuracy and reducing computing time. This paper presents a flexible feature-selection method based on an optimized kernel mutual information (OKMI) approach. Mutual information (MI) has been applied successfully in decision trees to rank variables; its aim is to connect class labels with the distribution of experimental data. The use of MI removes irrelevant features and decreases redundant features. However, MI is usually less robust when the data distribution is not centralized. To overcome this problem, we propose to use the OKMI approach, which combines MI and a kernel function. This approach may be used for feature selection with nonlinear models by defining kernels for feature vectors and class-label vectors. By optimizing the objection equations, we develop a new feature-selection algorithm that combines both Ml and kernel learning, we discuss the relationship among various kernel-selection methods. Experiments were conducted to compare the new technique applied to various data sets with other methods, and in each case the OKMI approach performs better than the other methods in terms of feature-classification accuracy and computing time. OKMI method solves the problem of computation complexity in the probability of distribution, and avoids this problem by finding the optimal features at very low computational cost. As a result, the OKMI method with the proposed algorithm is effective and robust over a wide range of real applications on expert systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Identification of influential users for news and messages propagation constitutes one of the most important topics in analysis of social networks. The success of the spreading process in these networks depends on the mechanism for selection and specification of the influential users. Beside selection of influential users, the distances between selected users should be considered in this mechanism to ensure minimum overlap and maximum coverage of a wider area of the network. Simultaneous meeting of the two objectives may be contradictory. In this paper, we propose a new approach for selection of the set of influential users using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method that seeks to present a solution by considering the above two objectives. The simulation results over real-world and artificial networks demonstrate that the set selected by the proposed approach exhibits greater spread of influence than those selected by the traditional approaches.

TI Attack scenario reconstruction using intrusion semantics

ID ALERT CORRELATION
AB Security information and event management (SIEM) systems receive a large number of alerts from different intrusion detection systems. They are expected, from these alerts, to make reliable and timely decisions regarding the types of ongoing attack scenarios and their priorities. However, the lack of an agreed-upon vocabulary for the representation of the domain knowledge makes it difficult for state-of-the-art SIEM systems to effectively manage these complex decisions. To overcome this problem, an ontology-based expert system approach can provide domain knowledge modeling as a foundation for disambiguation of meaning and automatic reasoning regarding ongoing attack scenarios. The proposed approach reconstructs attack scenarios by reasoning based on the evidences in the alert stream. The main idea of the proposed approach is to identify the causal relation between alerts using their similarity. This approach assumes that the similarity between two successive steps in an attack scenario is greater than that of two non-successive steps. Moreover, the similarity between the steps of the same attack scenario is greater than that between the steps of two different attack scenarios. The benefit of the proposed approach includes the fast and incremental reconstruction of known and unknown attack scenarios without expert intervention, which is an enormous step forward in developing expert and intelligent systems for cyber security. We evaluated the proposed technique by performing experiments on two known datasets: DARPA 2000 and MACCDC 2012. The results prove the advantages of the proposed approach with regard to completeness and soundness criteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bearing fault diagnosis represents the core of induction machines condition monitoring. This paper presents an application of fuzzy expert system (FES) to bearing faults diagnosis. Here, fuzzy rules are automatically induced from numerical data using the Similarity partition method. Data of faulty bearings presents high noise level. Thus, an Improved Range Overlaps method (IRO) is proposed to select input feature vectors by giving them validity degrees. The Similarity method partition was found confused with features presenting range overlap. Consequently, the new proposed Improved Range Overlaps method is found quite suitable for improving the classifier accuracy. The model validity and efficiency were proved using experimental bearing faults data from Case Western Reserve University database and the NSF I/UCR Center on Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) database.

ID SPOOFING DETECTION
AB Performance of face liveness detection algorithms in cross-database face liveness detection tests is one of the key issues in face-biometric based systems. Recently, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) classifiers have shown remarkable performance in intra-database face liveness detection tests. However, a little effort has been made to improve the generalization capability of CNN classifiers for cross-database and unconstrained face liveness detection tests. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for training deep CNN classifiers for face liveness detection task. We utilize continuous data-randomization (like bootstrapping) in the form of small mini-batches during training CNN classifiers on small scale face anti-spoofing database. Experimental results revealed that the proposed approach reduces the training time by 18.39%, while significantly lowering the HTER by 8.28% and 14.14% in cross-database tests on CASIA-FASD and Replay-Attack database respectively as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, the proposed approach achieves satisfactory results on intra-database and cross-database face liveness detection tests, claiming a good generality over other state-of-the-art face anti-spoofing approaches.

AB The paper deals with unconstrained face recognition task for the small sample size problem based on computation of distances between high-dimensional off-the-shelf features extracted by deep convolution neural network. We present the novel statistical recognition method, which maximizes the likelihood (joint probabilistic density) of the distances to all reference images from the gallery set. This likelihood is estimated with the known asymptotically normal distribution of the Kullback-Leibler discrimination between nonnegative features. Our approach penalizes the individuals if their feature vectors do not behave like the features of observed image in the space of dissimilarities of the gallery images. We provide the experimental study with the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild), YTF (YouTube Faces) and IJB-A (IARPA Janus Benchmark A) datasets and the state-of-the-art deep learning-based feature extractors (VGG-Face, VGGFace2, ResFace-101, CenterFace and Light CNN). It is demonstrated, that the proposed approach can be applied with traditional distances in order to increase accuracy in 0.3-5.5% when compared to known methods, especially if the training and testing images are significantly different.

AB The quality of document images has direct impacts on the performance of document image processing systems. Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) is, therefore, of fundamental importance to a numerous document processing applications. As manual quality assessment is almost impossible for a huge volume of document images generated in day-to-day life, it is critical to develop intelligent machine operated methods to estimate the quality of document images. In this paper, a blind document image quality assessment method is proposed to deal with the problem of DIQA in real scenarios, as reference images are not always available. To estimate the quality of a document image, the document is first sampled into a set of patches. The extracted patches are then filtered out based on their level of foreground information using a patch selection strategy. For every selected patch, a cluster assignment is then performed to obtain its quality from a quality aware bag of visual words constructed using k-means clustering. An average pooling is finally employed to estimate the quality of the input document image. To evaluate the proposed method, a dataset composed of document images and three scene image datasets were considered for experimentation. The results obtained from the proposed method demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DIQA method. These achievements in applied computational intelligence, expert and decision support systems make a good foundation for creating practical tools to automate document image forgery detection, and archiving process.

AB We extend the application of security games from offline patrol scheduling to online surveillance-driven resource allocation. An important characteristic of this new domain is that attackers are unable to observe or reliably predict defenders' strategies. To this end, in this paper we introduce a new solution concept, called acceptable costs of minimax regret equilibrium, which is independent of attackers' knowledge of defenders. Specifically, we study how a player's decision making can be influenced by the emotion of regret and their attitude towards loss, formalized by the principle of acceptable costs of minimax regret. We then analyse properties of our solution concept and propose a linear programming formulation. Finally, we prove that our solution concept is robust with respect to small changes in a player's degree of loss tolerance by a theoretical evaluation and demonstrate its viability for online resource allocation through an experimental evaluation.

However, real-world data comes with a myriad of challenges, amongst the most prominent of which is the fact that it can exhibit a high level of imbalance. This can come in the form of both within- and between-class imbalance. While a significant amount of research has been devoted to the impact of within-class imbalance over binary classifiers, very little attention has been given to their impact on one-class classifiers, which are typically used in situations of extreme between-class imbalance. During our collaboration with Health Canada into the identification of anomalous gamma-ray spectra, the issue of within-class imbalance in a one-class classification setting was highly significant. In this setting, the imbalance comes from the fact that the background data that we wish to model is composed of two concepts (background no-rain and rain); the rain sub-concept is rare and corresponds to spectra affected by the presence of water in the environment. In this article, we present our work into developing systems for detecting anomalous gamma-rays that are able to handle both the inherent between-class and within-class imbalance present in the domain. We test and validate our system over data provided to us by Health Canada from three sites across Canada. Our results indicated that oversampling the sub-concept improves the performance of the baseline classifiers and multiple classifier system when measured by the geometric mean of the per-class accuracy.

AB This study investigated the effectiveness of SIFT-MS versus chemical profiling, both coupled to multivariate data analysis, to classify 95 Extra Virgin Argan Oils (EVAO), originating from five Moroccan Argan forest locations. The full scan option of SIFT-MS, is suitable to indicate the geographic origin of EVAO based on the fingerprints obtained using the three chemical ionization precursors (H3O+, NO+ and O-2(+)). The chemical profiling (including acidity, peroxide value, spectrophotometric indices, fatty acids, tocopherols-and sterols composition) was also used for classification. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM), were compared. The SIFT-MS data were therefore fed to variable-selection methods to find potential biomarkers for classification. The classification models based either on chemical profiling or SIFT-MS data were able to classify the samples with high accuracy.
   SIFT-MS was found to be advantageous for rapid geographic classification.

AB This study describes a method for the simultaneous determination of galactose, glucose, lactose and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) in GOS raw materials (GOS syrups and powdered GOS) by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). The GOS raw materials were extracted with phosphate buffer. The extract was then treated with beta-galactosidase to hydrolyze GOS and lactose. The total amounts of galactose and glucose released from GOS and lactose were determined in the treated solution. Free galactose, glucose and lactose were determined in the initial solution. The glucose in a beta-galactosidase solution was also determined. The content of GOS in GOS raw materials was calculated by the increment of galactose and glucose after GOS were hydrolyzed, and the glucose and galactose also released from lactose were taken into consideration. The validated method has been successfully applied to determine the content of galactose, glucose, lactose and GOS in GOS syrups and powdered GOS.

AB In this work, a procedure allowing effective digestion of a high mass of yerba mate (up to 1500 mg) using diluted HNO3, in a system pressurized with oxygen, is proposed. Digests were suitable for direct analysis by ICP-MS, virtually free of interferences. Digestion was performed using 7 mol l(-1) HNO3 and 8 bar O-2. The digestion efficiency was better than 92% and digests presented a relatively low acidity (< 10 mmol HNO3). The limit of quantification was 4.0, 1.0 and 1.0 ng g(-1) for As, Cd and Pb, respectively. Under optimized conditions up to 1500 mg of sample were digested and no interferences were observed during analyses by ICP-MS, making this approach suitable for routine determination of As, Cd and Pb in yerba mate and also in agreement with the quality control requirements.

AB There is very little information on effects of Penicillium on aroma of passito wine. This study analyzed chemical composition and sensory properties of Amarone wines produced from withered grapes artificially contaminated by P. expansum or P. crustosum. Changes in properties of the two wines were evident by comparing wines obtained from healthy and Botrytis cinerea infected grapes used as controls. Penicillium infection affected primary and volatile composition of Amarone wine. Sensory profiles of these wines, obtained by descriptive analysis, resulted in clear differences in the wines between themselves and the control wines. Partial least square regression analysis explained only partially the relationship between molecules and sensory descriptors, and showed the existence of complex interactions of compounds mainly involved in specific aroma attributes. GC-olfactive analysis showed a greater number of odour regions in P. crustosum wine compared to control wines. Useful insight was provided into understanding how Penicillium rotten grapes affect Amarone wine properties.

AB Strawberry has a unique status within the fruit species in terms of health and taste related compounds. This experimental study concerned the application of a bio-stimulant at various drip irrigation levels (IR125, IR100, IR75 and IR50). The effects of the bio-stimulant (seaweed extract) on the eating quality, i.e., the taste-related (TSS, fructose, glucose, sucrose and citric, malic, L-ascorbic acid), and health-related (antioxidant activity, total phenol, myricetin and quercetin) compounds were studied in two strawberry cultivars. The 'Rubygem' with its higher sugar and lower acid content has been more preferable than the 'Kabarla' cultivar. The bio-stimulant contributes to taste by improving the TSS, fructose, sucrose and also to health by increasing the quercetin content of the fruit which is associated to the cardiovascular properties and cancer reducing agents. The experiment conducted revealed significant increases only in the TSS contents and antioxidant activity under the IR50 and IR75 deficit irrigation treatments.

AB Phenolics can trap lipid-derived reactive carbonyls as a protective function that diminishes the broadcasting of the lipid oxidative damage to food macromolecules. In an attempt to clarify the trapping of 2,4-alkadienals by phenolics, this study analyzes the reactions of 2,4-hexadienal, 2,4-heptadienal, and 2,4-decadienal with 2-methylresorcinol. These reactions produced (E)-4-(alk-1-en-1-yl)-8-methyl-2,7-bis(prop-1-en-2-yloxy) chromanes, which were isolated and characterized by 1D and 2D NMR and MS. Carbonyl-phenol adduct formation was favored at pH > 7 and moderate temperatures (25-80 degrees C). Adducts were quantified and shown to be produced as a mixture of diastereomers. Diastereomers 2R, 4S plus 2S, 4R were formed to a higher extent than diastereomers 2R, 4R plus 2S, 4S under the different conditions assayed, although activation energies (E-a) for the formation of all of them was mostly the same (similar to 62 kJ.mol(-1)). These results show that phenolics can trap 2,4-alkadienals and provide the basis for the later detection of the formed adducts in food pro[ducts.

AB Different ways of vine-shoots revalorization have been proposed, but not in wine yet, as for example in the same way as oak chips are being used. In this work, vine-shoot samples were submitted to a thermogravimetric analysis to establish the temperature range for its lignin structure decomposition, resulting between 160 and 180 degrees C. Then, vine-shoot chips from Airen and Cencibel cultivars, with a particle size around 2.5-3.5 cm, were submitted to six toasting conditions: 160 degrees C and 180 degrees C for 45, 60 and 75 min. Their volatile composition was very similar to oak chips, being vanillin the most important compound. Moreover, such vine-shoots have an interesting content of prodelphinidins that together with the stilbenes may contribute to wine antioxidant activity. The toasting conditions at 180 degrees C/45 min were the most suitable one for releasing the mentioned valuable compounds in order to propose vine-shoots as new enological additive similar to oak chips.

AB Egg white thinning during ambient storage is a well-known phenomenon. The objective of the study was to characterize the formation of peptides < 10 kDa in egg white during storage at room temperature. The results indicated that the content of peptides in the egg white fraction of < 10 kDa increased gradually. Similar but a faster trend was observed for the fraction of < 3 kDa. Gallin, also called ovodefensin (similar to 7 kDa), was the main component in 10-3 kDa egg white fraction, which rapidly degraded and disappeared at 28 d of storage. Mass spectrometry analysis of < 3 kDa fraction identified 6 peptide fragments from ovotransferrin and 11 peptides from ovomucin. Ovodefensin, ovotransferrin and ovomucin are the major innate components of egg defense; thus the degradation of these proteins during storage contributes to egg white thinning and increased susceptibility to bacterial contamination. This study provides the insights on the molecular mechanism of egg deterioration during prolonged ambient storage.

AB The evaluation of changes in the fatty acid composition in Lupinus species after the debittering process is crucial to determine their nutritional implications. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the fatty acid composition in Lupinus albus and L. mutabilis after the debittering process. Lupinus species showed different fatty acid compositions which changed depending on the debittering process applied. The debittering process changed the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in L. albus, whereas in L. mutabilis it changed the w-6/w-3 ratio. However, the total saturated fatty acid content remained stable in both species after the debittering process. The changes in L. albus were associated with the fatty acid desaturation and a conversion into unsaturated fatty acids, whereas in L. mutabilis with the lipid peroxidation by decreasing the linoleic acid content. Nutritional implications of these changes in the fatty acid composition are discussed.

AB Ganoderma fungi have long been used as a famous traditional medicine and food in country of East Asia. In this work, two new farnesyl phenolic compounds, ganoduriporols A and B (1 and 2), were isolated from the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma duripora, and their structures were elucidated using various spectroscopic methods. Anti-inflammatory activities were assayed and evaluated for the two compounds. Ganoduriporols A and B exhibited dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, ganoduriporol A was demonstrated to inhibit the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) through the suppression of COX-2, MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathway in LPS-induced macrophage cells. These results suggested that these two new farnesyl phenolic compounds and the fruiting body of G. duripora could serve as anti-inflammatory agents for medicinal use or functional food.

AB A commercial arsenic field kit designed to measure inorganic arsenic (iAs) in water was modified into a field deployable method (FDM) to measure iAs in rice. While the method has been validated to give precise and accurate results in the laboratory, its on-site field performance has not been evaluated. This study was designed to test the method on-site in Malawi in order to evaluate its accuracy and precision in determination of iAs on-site by comparing with a validated reference method and giving original data on inorganic arsenic in Malawian rice and rice-based products. The method was validated by using the established laboratory-based HPLC-ICPMS. Statistical tests indicated there were no significant differences between on-site and laboratory iAs measurements determined using the FDM (p=0.263, alpha=0.05) and between on-site measurements and measurements determined using HPLC-ICP-MS (p=0.299, alpha=0.05). This method allows quick (within 1 h) and efficient screening of rice containing iAs concentrations on-site.

AB The complex formation between a copper ion and the dietary flavonoid quercetin (QU) and its two glycosides hyperin (HY) and rutin (RU) was studied by the combined use of spectroscopic measurement and the chemometric method. The spectral changes of pH titration revealed two successively formed deprotonated species of QU: the first formed species was proposed to be the 3-hydroxyl group deprotonated QU, and the second was the quinone form QU, which was formed by oxidation after the hydroxyl groups in the B-ring were deprotonated at high pH values. Similar results were obtained for HY and RU with two deprotonated species forming at high pH values. UV/visible spectroscopy showed successive formation of CuL2 and CuL species of QU at pH 6.0, while only Cu2L was formed for HY and RU at this pH. Glycoside moieties in the C-ring of flavonoids decrease the conditional associated constants between flavonoids and Cu2+.

AB The objective of this work was to assess the effects of a traditional parboiling treatment on physical, chemical and functional properties of yellow maize kernels. For this, maize kernels were subjected to the three main stages of a traditional parboiling process (soaking, steaming, and drying) at different moisture contents (15%, 25%, or 35%), and different pressure steaming times (0, 15, or 30 min). Kernels were evaluated for physical and chemical changes, while manually generated endosperm fractions were further evaluated for nutritional and functional changes. The parboiling process negatively altered the maize kernels properties by increasing the number of kernels with burst pericarp and decreasing the total carotenoid content in the endosperm by 42%. However, the most intense conditions (35% moisture and 30 min steam) lowered the number of broken kernels by 41%, and the number of stress cracks by 36%. Results also demonstrated that soaking enhanced the nutritional value of soaked yellow maize by increasing the thiamine content and the bound phenolic content in the endosperm fraction up to 102%. The proper implementation of this hydrothermal treatment could lead to significant enhancements in nutritional and functionality of maize products.

AB Eight new ent-kaurane diterpene fatty acid esters, namely caffarolides A-H (1-8), were isolated from green beans of Coffea arabica. Their chemical structures were confirmed by extensive spectroscopic analysis including 1D, 2D NMR (HSQC, HMBC, H-1-H-1 COSY, and ROESY), HRMS, IR and CD spectra and by GC-FID analysis. Interestingly, the diterpene moiety of these new compounds first occurred in genus Coffea. All the isolates were evaluated for platelet aggregation activity in vitro. As the results, caffarolides C, D and F (3, 4 and 6) showed induction effect for platelet aggregation and the possible structure-activity relationships have been discussed briefly.

AB An extraction method and an UHPLC-MS/MS method for the quantification of CPA in dry-cured ham were developed and validated. To optimise detection and quantification of CPA, the composition of mobile phase, flow rates, gradient-related factors and solvents used for resuspension of dry extracts were evaluated. Besides, four extraction methods were tested. The best peak shape and resolution were obtained by eluting the mobile phase consisting in acetic acid-ammonium acetate buffer pH 5.75/methanol in gradient mode at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The method 4 relied on the QuEChERS methodology was the most effective one. Almost half of the 61 dry-cured ham samples examined were contaminated with CPA, with values ranging from 36.1 to 540.1 ng/g. The combination of a QuEChERS-based extraction method and analysis by UHPLC-MS/MS allows highly sensitive, fast, reliable and cheap detection and quantification of CPA for routine analysis in ham.

AB This study evaluated the physicochemical characterization and rheological behavior of gabiroba pulp, and a gabiroba jam formulation. Gabiroba pulp presented a heterogeneous ultrastructure with a denser area formed by a compact mesh and a porous interface containing fibers. The fibers' presence promoted a slip effect when the gabiroba pulp was subjected to shear. Gabiroba pulp showed a gel behavior with thermal stability. Gabiroba jam, developed using pulp as the raw material, had shear thinning behavior exhibiting yield stress described by the Herschel-Bulkley model. The dynamic oscillatory analysis showed that gabiroba jam typically behaved like a gel, i.e., G' values higher than the G''. in all frequency ranges evaluated. The results showed that gabiroba pulp is suitable for use as a raw material in the development of food products such as jam, encouraging the preservation of this native Brazilian species.

AB Iridoid blue-based pigments (IBBP) extract of Genipa americana L. represents a natural alternative additive for food applications and also exerts desirable biological effects on human health. In this study the iridoids present in the extract were identified, the influence of pH and temperature on color difference (Delta E) of IBBP was evaluated using a central composite design (CCD) and finally the antioxidant capacity was monitored before and after its in vitro digestion. Ten glucoside iridoids were detected and the main compounds identified were genipin, genipin 1-beta-gentiobioside and geniposide. It was also observed an increase of 17-18% of antioxidant capacity after the in vitro digestion, respectively. Among the conditions tested, the color of extract was more stable at 12-20 degrees C and low pH (3.0-4.0), suggesting that it is compatible for coloring acidic foods. Finally, the in vitro digestion also increased the antioxidant capacity (ORAC assay) by 39%.

AB This study investigates the anti-allergic properties of peanut skin polyphenols (PSP)-enriched peanut (PN) protein aggregates. PSP was blended with PN flour at concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 40% (w/w). Rat basophil leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) were sensitized with either anti-DNP-IgE or PN-allergic plasma followed by co-exposure to unmodified PN flour (control) or PSP-PN protein aggregates and Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin. Immunoblotting and staining were performed to measure the IgE binding capacity of PSP-PN aggregates. Results showed that 30% PSP-PN aggregate significantly reduced beta-hexosaminidase and histamine levels by 54.2% and 49.2%, respectively compared with control. Immunoblotting results revealed 40% PSP-PN aggregates significantly decreased IgE binding by 19%. The phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK was significantly reduced while phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK increased upon PSP-PN protein aggregate exposure to the cells. Our results show that aggregation of PSP to PN proteins reduces allergic response by inhibiting Ca2+-induced MAPK-dependent cell degranulation.

AB In this study, a one-step method for producing phytosteryl phenolates, namely phytosteryl cinnamate and ferulate, has been successfully developed and their chemical structures were confirmed by FT-IR, MS and NMR. The highest yield of phytosteryl ferulate (85.7%) was obtained at 100 degrees C for 2 h after optimization. A Lewis acid catalyst scandium triflate was selected as the catalyst, and it turned out that it could be reused for at least five times without significant loss of activity. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that the solubility of phytosteryl phenolates in soybean oil was much higher than in both phenolic acid and phytosterol, which was conducive to expand their applications in oil-based food. The research finding helps realize convenient, green and efficient synthesis of phytosteryl phenolates.

AB In this study, a novel multifunctional tag, S1v1 (AEAEAHAH)(2), was generated from a self-assembling amphipathic peptide in the Zuotin protein sequence by replacing lysine residues with histidine residues. After fusing S1v1 at the N-terminus through a PT-linker, the expressions of polygalacturonate lyase (PGL), lipoxygenase (LOX) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were enhanced by 3.8, 0.2 and 1.52-fold, respectively,compared to the wild-type proteins. However, the frequently used His-tag with a PT-linker had negligible effects on expression. Moreover, the three S1v1 fusions were purified with high purifies and acceptable recovery rates due to their affinity to the nickel column. In contrast, PGL and LOX fused with His-tag were unable to be adsorbed by the nickel column, and His-tag fusion only achieved 8.23% of GFP recovery in the same purification process.In addition, S1v1 fusions induced the enhancement of thermostabilties and/or activities of PGL, LOX and GFP. These results indicated that S1v1 was much more effective than the frequently used His-tag during protein expression and purification in these cases, and will be especially suitable for those proteins requiring the simultaneous enhancement of expression, production and catalytic properties.

AB The genus Enterococcus occurs as native microbiota of fermented products due to its broad environmental distribution and its resistance to salt concentrations. Enterococcus faecalis F, a non-pathogenic strain isolated from a ripened cheese, has demonstrated useful enzymatic capabilities, a probiotic behavior and antibacterial activity against some food-borne pathogens, mainly due to peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Its use as a natural pathogen-control agent could be further enhanced through the production of a bacteriocin, e.g. Enterocin A, because of its remarkable antilisterial activity. In this work, a markerless allelic insertion method was used to obtain an enterococcal strain capable of producing a functional enterocin. Agar diffusion tests showed that the recombinant strain was active against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and the pathogenic strain E. faecalis V583. When grown in liquid culture together with L. monocytogenes, it attained a two-log reduction of the pathogen counts in lesser time relative to the native strain. Because the DNA construction is integrated into the chromosome, the improved strain avoids the use of antibiotics as selective pressure; besides, it does not require an inductor because of the inclusion of a constitutive promoter in the construction. Its technological and antibacterial capabilities make the improved E. faecalis strain a potential culture for use in the food industry.

AB Sodium butyrate (NaBu) is an efficient supplement for increasing recombinant protein production in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture. To elucidate the effects of NaBu on miRNA expression profile in recombinant CHO (rCHO) cells, differentially expressed miRNAs in NaBu-treated rCHO cells were assessed by NanoString nCounter analysis. This result showed that eight mature mouse miRNAs (let-7b, let-7d, miR-15b, miR-25, miR-27a, miR-99a, miR-125a-5p, and miR-125b-5p) were differentially expressed. Furthermore, quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of eight mature CHO miRNAs, annotated using a miRBase database, confirmed the transcriptomic findings. Among the potential corresponding target mRNAs for the selected mature miRNAs, seven cell growth-related target genes (e2f2, akt2, mtor, bcl-2, bim, p38a, and bmf) and five N-glycosylation-related target genes (neu1, b4galt3, gale, man1b1 and mgat4a) were selected by considering the effectiveness of NaBu on rCHO cell culture. The altered expression patterns of the 12 target mRNAs were inversely correlated with those of the selected mature miRNAs. Altogether, NanoString nCounter analysis may be useful for identifying differentially expressed miRNAs in rCHO cells.

AB Solvent Extraction was tested to extract astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis in red phase (HPR), by investigating effects of solvents, extraction pressure and temperature. Astaxanthin isomers were identified and quantified in the extract. The performances of acetone and ethanol, Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) solvents, were explored. Negligible effect of pressure was found, while with increasing extraction temperature astaxanthin recovery increased fill a maximum value, beyond which thermal degradation seemed to be greater than the positive effect of temperature on extraction. Furthermore, to maximize the extraction yield of astaxanthin, mechanical pre-treatment of HPR biomass was carried out and several extraction runs were consecutively performed. Experimental results showed that after the mechanical pre-treatment the astaxanthin recovery strongly increased while a single extraction run of 20 min was sufficient to extract more than 99% of total astaxanthin extracted. After pre-treatment, maximum recovery of about 87% was found for acetone (pressure = 100 bar; temperature = 40 degrees C; total time = 60 min).

AB Enantiopure intermediates are preferred for drug synthesis in pharmaceutical industry. Lipases are widely used for chiral resolution of optically active compounds based on kinetic resolution. In the kinetic resolution, two enantiomers react with different rates in presence of a chiral catalyst or reagent, resulting in obtaining one enantiomer of great excess compared to other. The enantiomeric ratio (E) is closely related to the free energy difference (Delta Delta G) of the activated state of substrate enantiomers. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations with umbrella sampling technique can be used for estimation of activation free energy change of enantiomers. In this work, lipase-catalyzed transesterification of racemic alcohols with single and double hydroxyl groups have been studied. The umbrella sampling studies have been carried out for Candida rugosa lipase and Burkholderia cepacia lipase in n-hexane. The distance between serine residue in the catalytic triad and the ligand has been considered as a reaction coordinate and various conformations have been selected for MD simulation. The E value has been estimated based on free energy change from umbrella sampling. The estimated E values are in good agreement with experimental data. The work highlights changes in lipase conformation in n-hexane, ligand-protein interaction as well as free energy curve as a function of the reaction coordinate.

AB The study reports the preparation of a composite consisting of magnetite coated with nanosilica extracted from oil palm leaves (OPL) ash as nanosupports for immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) and its application for the synthesis of butyl butyrate. Results of immobilization parameters showed that similar to 80% of CRL (84.5 mg) initially offered was immobilized onto the surface of the nanosupports to yield a maximum protein loading and specific activity of 67.5 +/- 0.72 mg/g and 320.8 +/- 0.42 U/g of support, respectively. Surface topography, morphology as well as information on surface composition obtained by Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that CRL was successfully immobilized onto the nanosupports, affirming its biocompatibility. Under optimal conditions (3.5 mg/mL protein loading, at 45 degrees C, 3 h and molar ratio 2:1 (1-butanol:n-butyric acid) the CRL/Gl-A-SiO2 MNPs gave a maximum yield of 94 +/- 0.24% butyl butyrate as compared to 84 +/- 0.32% in the lyophilized CRL. CRL/Gl-A-SiO2-MNPs showed an extended operational stability, retaining 50% of its initial activity after 17 consecutive esterification cycles. The results indicated that OPL derived nanosilica coated on magnetite can potentially be employed as carrier for lipase immobilization in replacement of the non-renewable conventionalsilica sources.

AB The seven in absentia like 7 gene (At5g37890, SINAL7) from Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a RING finger protein belonging to the SINA superfamily that possesses E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity. SINAL7 has the ability to self-ubiquitinate and to mono-ubiquitinate glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase 1 (GAPC1), suggesting a role for both proteins in a hypothetical signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. In this study, the in vivo effects of SINAL7 on plant physiology were examined by over-expressing SINAL7 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Phenotypic and gene expression analyses suggest the involvement of SINAL7 in the regulation of several vegetative parameters, essentially those that affect the aerial parts of the plants. Over-expression of SINAL7 resulted in an increase in the concentrations of hexoses and sucrose, with a concommitant increase in plant biomass, particularly in the number of rosette leaves and stem thickness. Interestingly, using the CAB1 (chlorophyll ab binding protein 1) gene as a marker revealed a delay in the onset of senescence. Transgenic plants also displayed a remarkable level of drought resistance, indicating the complexity of the response to SINAL7 over-expression.

Most of the oil wells in Indian subcontinent have temperature higher than 60 degrees C. Also, the role of methanogenic consortia from high temperature petroleum reservoir for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) has not been explored much. Hence, in the present study methanogens isolated from thermophilic oil wells (70 degrees C) were evaluated for enhanced oil recovery. Methane gas is produced by methanogens, which helps in oil recovery from depleted oil wells through reservoir re-pressurization and also can be recovered from reservoir along with crude oil as alternative energy source. Therefore, in this study indigenous methanogenic consortium (TERIL146) was enriched from high temperature oil reservoir showing (12 mmol/l) gas production along with other metabolites. Sequencing analysis revealed the presence of Methanothermobacter sp., Thermoanaerobacter sp., Gelria sp. and Thermotoga sp. in the consortium. Furthermore, the developed indigenous consortium TERIL146 showed 8.3% incremental oil recovery in sandpack assay. The present study demonstrates successful recovery of both oil and energy (gas) by the developed indigenous methanogenic consortium TERIL146 for potential application in thermophilic depleted oil wells of Indian subcontinent.

AB Snakin-1 is a cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptide (AMP) isolated from potato tubers, with broad-spectrum activity. It belongs to the Snakin/GASA family, whose members have been studied because of their diverse roles in important plant processes, including defense. To analyze if this defensive function may lead to disease tolerance in lettuce, one of the most worldwide consumed leafy vegetable, we characterized three homozygous transgenic lines overexpressing Snakin-1. They were biologically assessed by the inoculation with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum both in vitro and in planta at the greenhouse. When in vitro assays were performed with R. solani on Petri dishes containing crude plant extracts it was confirmed that the expressed Snakin-1 protein has antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, transgenic lines showed a better response than wild type in in vivo challenges against R. solani both in chamber and in greenhouse. In addition, two of these lines showed significant in vivo protection against the pathogen S. sclerotiorum in challenge assays on adult plants.
   Our results show that Snakin-1 is an interesting candidate gene for the selection/breeding of lettuce plants with increased fungal tolerance.

AB We explored the effects of media and clonal variation on the lactate shift which can be considered as one of the desirable features in CHO cell culture. Various culture profiles with the specific growth and antibody production rates under three different media conditions in two CHO producing clones were evaluated by resorting to multivariate statistical analysis. In most cases, glutamine depletion coincided with lactate consumption, suggesting that glutaminolysis rather than glycolysis was the preferred pathway for the pyruvate supply toward lactate production. With respect to the lactate shift, high performing medium showed higher glutamate uptake, higher aspartate secretion and lower serine uptake compared to other media conditions. In addition, clone itself exhibited the desired lactate consumption more consistently accompanying with distinguishing phenotype. The clone exhibiting lactate shift produced lesser lactate in exponential phase but two-fold higher non-toxic alanine, thus leading to better culture environment. Thus, we understand the balanced selection of clone and media composition enables cells to utilize the metabolic pathways for the desired lactate shift.

AB This study investigates motor oil (3, 5, 7.5 and 10% (v v(-1))) as a sole carbon source for the production of Alcanivorax borkumensis in shake flasks and a 5 L bench-scale fermenter in comparison to the standard media. Shake flask studies showed a significant and higher cell growth (p = 0.000038), lipase (p = 0.006900) and alkane hydroxylase production (p = 0.000921) by Alcanivorax borkumensis when motor oil was used as the substrate. Based on Tukey post-hoc tests, 5% motor oil concentration was selected as the optimal substrate concentration. The 5 L fermenter experiments conducted using motor oil at 5% (v v(-1)) concentration, under controlled conditions exhibited significant and higher alkane hydroxylase and lipase activities (55.6 U mL(-1) (p = 0.018418) and 208.30 U mL(-1) (p = 0.020087), respectively) as compared with those of motor oil at 3% (v v(-1)) and n-hexadecane at 3% (v v(-1)) concentration which was used as control. Cell growth was significantly higher when motor oil (3 or 5%) was used as a substrate (p = 0.024705).
   Enzymatic degradation tested on two different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminated groundwaters showed 37.4% removal after 5 days with a degradation rate of 196.6 ppb day(-1) and 82.8% removal after 10 days with a degradation rate of 217.54 ppb day(-1 )for the 1st site and an almost complete bio-degradation with 95% removal and 499.02 ppb day(-1 )removal rate after only 5 days for the 2nd site.

AB The World Health Organization (WHO) has tagged non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as one of the twenty-first century's major development challenges. NCDs account for over 15 million deaths annually and over 80% of those deaths occur in developing countries and among the poorest populations. Biotechnology presents unique opportunities to improve the early diagnosis and the treatment of NCDs. This review describes the major applications of biotechnology for a better clinical management of NCDs, i.e. the implementation of innovative diagnostic approaches and the production of innovative treatments, including those based on monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, regulatory nucleic acids and cell-based therapies for regenerative medicine. In this context, it also examines the major challenges faced by biotechnology in developing countries.

AB In spite of huge endeavors in cell line engineering to produce glycoproteins with desired and uniform glyco-forms, it is still not possible in vivo. Alternatively, in vitro glycoengineering can be used for the modification of glycans. However, in vitro glycoengineering relies on expensive nucleotide sugars, such as uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) which serves as GlcNAc donor for the synthesis of various glycans. In this work, we present a systematic study for the cell-free de novo synthesis and regeneration of UDP-GlcNAc from polyphosphate, UMP and GlcNAc by a cascade of five enzymes (N-acetylhexosamine kinase (NahK), Glc-1P uridyltransferase (GalU), uridine monophosphate kinase (URA6), polyphosphate kinase (PPK3), and inorganic diphosphatase (PmPpA). All enzymes were expressed in E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Results from one-pot experiments demonstrate the successful production of UDP-GlcNAc with a yield approaching 100%. The highest volumetric productivity of the cascade was about 0.81 g L-1 h(-1) of UDP-GlcNAc. A simple model based on mass action kinetics was sufficient to capture the dynamic behavior of the multienzyme pathway. Moreover, a design equation based on metabolic control analysis was established to investigate the effect of enzyme concentration on the UDP-GlcNAc flux and to demonstrate that the flux of UDP-GlcNAc can be controlled by means of the enzyme concentrations. The effect of temperature on the UDP-GlcNAc flux followed an Arrhenius equation and the optimal co-factor concentration (Mg2+) for high UDP-GlcNAc synthesis rates depended on the working temperature. In conclusion, the study covers the entire engineering process of a multienzyme cascade, i.e. pathway design, enzyme expression, enzyme purification, reaction kinetics and investigation of the influence of basic parameters (temperature, co-factor concentration, enzyme concentration) on the synthesis rate. Thus, the study lays the foundation for future cascade optimization, preparative scale UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and for in situ coupling of the network with UDP-GlcNAc transferases to efficiently regenerate UDP-GlcNAc. Hence, this study provides a further step towards cost-effective in vitro glycoengineering of antibodies and other glycosylated proteins.

AB In order to minimize the environmental impacts of growing population, progressive exploitation of fossil resources and negative consequences of climate change the politically intended goal is to successively transform our primarily oil-based into a bio-based economy. Hence, one goal is to significantly reduce the utilization of fossil resources by increasing the use of renewable energy and resources (i.e. biomass) and the efficiency of their conversion processes. Including existing technologies into the development of future concepts could accelerate the transition to a bio-economy. As one solution integrated biorefinery concepts based on agricultural biogas plants are discussed, which convert biomass with minimal energy consumption to a multitude of products without generating waste. However, they still have huge potential in terms of increased biomass utilization. In that context, catch crops offer interesting opportunities as a substrate for those biorefineries, since they support soil regeneration while generating additional products for the bio-economy without increasing land use. In this study a selection of significant indicators was chosen in order to determine the environmental effectivity and economic efficiency of these biorefinery concepts by a systematic assessment of possible process schemes. Thus within this study the usability of the chosen indicators and the potential of catch crops in advanced biorefineries is assessed.

AB Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that have been extensively studied as potential autotrophic biotechnological hosts for the production of different carbon-based end-products directly from atmospheric CO2. While commercially competitive applications do not yet exist, the production of ethanol in cyanobacteria is the most mature technology, endorsed by relatively high production yields and established status of ethanol in the global biofuel market. Within this concept, the aim here was to systematically compare ethanol tolerance of different commonly used cyanobacterial strains and substrains, in order to assess their relative potential for biotechnological production platforms. The comparison revealed clear strain-specific differences in ethanol toxicity, with growth inhibition GI(50 )values ranging between 3 gL(-1) (0.4% V/V) and 28 g L-1 (3.5% V/V). The most tolerant wild-type strains were Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (substrain A) and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, which did not show any apparent effect in growth below ethanol concentrations 9.2 gL(-1 )(1.2% V/V). In comparison to typical biotechnological yeast strains used for ethanol fermentation, these values are clearly lower but still around the same order of magnitude. The results also underlined the challenges in direct number-based comparison between cyanobacterial strains and culture conditions due to inconsistencies in respect to chlorophyll content, cell morphology and optical properties.

TI Transcriptome profiling in blood before and after hepatitis B
   vaccination shows significant differences in gene expression between

AB Introduction: As the hepatitis B virus is widely spread and responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, WHO recommends vaccination from infancy to reduce acute infection and chronic carriers. However, current subunit vaccines are not 100% efficacious and leave 5-10% of recipients unprotected.
   Methods: To evaluate immune responses after Engerix-B vaccination, we determined, using mRNA-sequencing, whole blood early gene expression signatures before, at day 3 and day 7 after the first dose and correlated this with the resulting antibody titer after two vaccine doses.
   Results: Our results indicate that immune related genes are differentially expressed in responders mostly at day 3 and in non-responders mostly at day 7. The most remarkable difference between responders and non-responders were the differentially expressed genes before vaccination. The granulin precursor gene (GRN) was significantly downregulated in responders while upregulated in non-responders at day 0. Furthermore, absolute granulocytes numbers were significantly higher in non-responders at day 0.
   Conclusion: The non-responders already showed an activated state of the immune system before vaccination. Furthermore, after vaccination, they exhibited a delayed and partial immune response in comparison to the responders. Our data may indicate that the baseline and untriggered immune system can influence the response upon hepatitis B vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chagas disease is a protozoan parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. This injurious disease spread by the circulation of the blood sucking triatomine insects and transmitted to humans. Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America and also known as American trypanosomasis. Currently, 7 million people are infected by T. cruzi infection and about 22,000 death cases were reported per year throughout the Americas. Various immunization approaches against T. cruzi infection have been examined and some of the developed vaccine showed efficacy in animal models but there is no effective and safe vaccines for humans have been developed yet. Since, the drug resistance is increasing day by day because the developed drug (nifurtimox and benznidazole) to control T. cruzi infection, failed to activate a prodrug and still no drug and vaccine have been established. To control the infection of chagas disease, here in this study we use immunoinformatics method to design multi-epitope subunit vaccine against T. cruzi infection. Moreover, on the basis of immunogenicity B and T cell epitopes were evaluated. The allergenicity, antigenicity was predicted to ensure the safety of vaccine constructs whereas, the physiochemical property showing the stable nature of final vaccine model. Further, molecular docking was performed to optimize the interaction between TLR-2 and TLR-4 (receptor) and vaccine model (ligand) complex. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to evaluate the energy minimization; RMSD and RMSF plot which confirm the stability of TLR-2 and TLR-4 (receptor) present on immune cells and vaccine model (ligand) complex. This study needed the experimental validation for the safety and immunogenic behavior of designed vaccine protein and it may be helpful in future to control T. cruzi infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The broadly neutralizing antibody against HIV-1, b12, binds to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the outer domain (OD) of the gp120 subunit of HIV-1 Env. We have previously reported the design of an E. coli expressed fragment of HIV-1 gp120, b122a, containing about 70% of the b12 epitope with the idea of focusing the immune response to this structure. Since the b122a structure was found to be only partially folded, as assessed by circular dichroism and protease resistance, we attempted to stabilize it by the introduction of additional disulfide bonds. One such mutant, b122a1-b showed increased stability and bound b12 with 30-fold greater affinity as compared to b122a. Various b122a and OD fragment proteins were displayed on the surface of Qp virus-like particles. Sera raised against these particles in six-month long rabbit immunization studies could neutralize Tier1 viruses across different subtypes with the best results observed with b122a1-b displayed particles. Significantly higher amounts of antibodies directed towards the CD4bs were also elicited by particles displaying b122a1-b. This study highlights the ability of fragment immunogens to focus the antibody response to the conserved CD4bs of HIV-1. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This narrative review summarizes the current literature relating to pneumococcal vaccination in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, who are at risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) with its attendant high morbidity and mortality.
   The effect of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been examined in several small cohort studies in SOT recipients, most of which were kidney transplant recipients. The outcomes for these studies have been laboratory seroresponses or functional antibody titers. Overall, in most of these studies the transplant recipients were capable of generating measurable serological responses to pneumococcal vaccination but these responses were less than those of healthy controls. A mathematical model estimated the effectiveness of polysaccharide vaccination in SOT recipients to be one third less than those of patients with HIV.
   The evidence for the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in SOT is based on a small number of randomized controlled trials in liver and kidney transplant recipients. These trials demonstrated that SOT recipients mounted a serological response following vaccination however there was no benefit to the use of prime boosting (conjugate vaccine followed by polysaccharide vaccine). Currently there are no randomized studies investigating the clinical protection rate against IPD after pneumococcal vaccination by either vaccine type or linked to vaccine titers or other responses against pneumococcus. Concerns that vaccination may increase the risk of adverse alloresponses such as rejection and generation of donor specific antibodies are not supported by studies examining this aspect of vaccine safety. Pneumococcal vaccination is a potentially important strategy to reduce IPD in SOT recipients and is associated with excellent safety. Current international recommendations are based on expert opinion from conflicting data, hence there is a clear need for further high-quality studies in this high-risk population examining optimal vaccination regimens. Such studies should focus on strategies to optimize functional immune responses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cellular immunity established via immunotherapy holds the potential to eliminate solid tumors. Yet, cancer vaccines have failed to induce tumor-reactive T cells of sufficient quality to control disease. The inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) pathway has been implicated in both the selective induction of immunity over tolerance as well as licensing of IL-17-polarized cellular immunity. Herein, we evaluated the ability of ICOS ligand (ICOSL) to augment the immunogenicity of adenoviral-based vaccination targeting the unglycosylated MUCI peptide antigen. Vaccination disrupted immunotolerance in a transgenic mouse model recognizing human MUCI as a self-antigen, inducing robust MUCI-specific immunity. Augmenting vaccination with ICOSL induced a bipolar Th17/Th1 effector profile, marked by increased MUD-specific IL-17A production and RORyt expression in CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T cells which predominantly expressed IFN gamma/IL-2 and T-bet. The polarization and maintenance of Th17 cells established following ICOSL augmented vaccination was highly durable, with elevated IL-17A and ROR gamma t levels detected in CD4(+) T cells up to 10 months after initial immunization. Furthermore, provision of ICOSL significantly enhanced MUCI-specific IgG antibody in response to immunization. ICOSL signaling dramatically influenced CD4(+) T cell phenotype, altering gene expression of transcription factors and regulators of effector function following immunization. Interestingly, ICOSL augmentation failed to alter the transcriptional profile of CD8(+) T cells following immunization, affecting the magnitude, but not distribution, of gene expression. Collectively, ICOSL supports the induction of durable, antigen-specific Thl 7/Th1-mediated immunity in vivo, establishing a vaccination platform to enhance CD4(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and providing a crucial component of an effective cancer vaccine.

AB Background: Low efficacy of rotavirus (RV) vaccines in developing African and Asian countries, where malnutrition is prevalent, remains a major concern and a challenge for global health.
   Methods: To understand the effects of protein malnutrition on RV vaccine efficacy, we elucidated the innate, T cell and cytokine immune responses to attenuated human RV (AttHRV) vaccine and virulent human RV (VirHRV) challenge in germ-free (GF) pigs or human infant fecal microbiota (HIFM) transplanted gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs fed protein-deficient or-sufficient bovine milk diets. We also analyzed serum levels of tryptophan (TRP), a predictor of malnutrition, and kynurenine (KYN).
   Results: Protein-deficient pigs vaccinated with oral AttHRV vaccine had lower protection rates against diarrhea post-VirHRV challenge and significantly increased fecal virus shedding titers (HIFM transplanted but not GF pigs) compared with their protein-sufficient counterparts. Reduced vaccine efficacy in protein deficient pigs coincided with altered serum IFN-a, TNF-ct, IL-12 and IFN-y responses to oral AttHRV vaccine and the suppression of multiple innate immune parameters and HRV-specific IFN-y producing T cells post-challenge. In protein-deficient HIFM transplanted pigs, decreased serum KYN, but not TRP levels were observed throughout the experiment, suggesting an association between the altered TRP metabolism and immune responses.
   Conclusion: Collectively, our findings confirm the negative effects of protein deficiency, which were exacerbated in the HIFM transplanted pigs, on innate, T cell and cytokine immune responses to HRV and on vaccine efficacy, as well as on TRP-KYN metabolism.

AB HpaA is considered to be an effective protective antigen for vaccination against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Oral immunization with HpaA significantly decreases bacterial colonization in H. pylori infected mice. In this study, we investigated whether subcutaneous or intranasal immunization with HpaA could protect against H. pylori infection. Mice immunized subcutaneously with HpaA in Complete Freund's adjuvant, but not mice intranasally immunized with HpaA in CpG adjuvant acquired protection against H. pylori infection. However, intranasal immunization with immunodominant epitope peptides in CpG adjuvant protected mice against H. pylori infection, and immunodominant epitope peptides stimulated stronger Th1 responses and mediated more robust protection against H. pylori infection than subdominant ones. Our results suggest that the length of a candidate antigen is critical for particular vaccination routes, and that immunodominant epitope peptides are promising candidates for protection against H. pylori infection through nasal vaccination.

   polysaccharide vaccination program in Australia

AB Background: The Australian infant pneumococcal vaccination program was funded in 2005 using the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and the 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2011. The PCV7 and PCV13 programs resulted in herd immunity effects across all age-groups, including older adults. Coincident with the introduction of the PCV7 program in 2005, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (ppv23) was funded for all Australian adults aged over 65 years.
   Methods: A multi-cohort Markov model with a cycle length of one year was developed to retrospectively evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the PPV23 immunisation program from 2005 to 2015. The analysis was performed from the healthcare system perspective with costs and quality -adjusted life years discounted at 5% annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PPV23 doses provided from 2005 to 2015 was calculated separately for each year when compared to no vaccination. Parameter uncertainty was explored using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
   Results: It was estimated that PPV23 doses given out over the 11-year period from 2005 to 2015 prevented 771 hospitalisations and 99 deaths from invasive pneumococcal disease Opro. However, the estimated IPD cases and deaths prevented by PPV23 declined by more than 50% over this period (e.g. from 12.9 deaths for doses given out in 2005 to 6.1 in 2015), likely driven by herd effects from infant PCV programs. The estimated ICER over the period 2005 to 2015 was approximately A$224,000/QALY gained compared to no vaccination. When examined per year, the ICER for each individual year worsened from $140,000/QALY in 2005 to $238,000/QALY in 2011 to $286,000/Q,ALY in 2015.
   Conclusion: The cost-effectiveness of the PPV23 program in older Australians was estimated to have worsened over time. It is unlikely to have been cost-effective, unless PPV23 provided protection against non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia and/or a low vaccine price was negotiated. A key policy priority should be to review of the future use of PPV23 in Australia, which is likely to be more cost-effective in certain high-risk groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Cervical cancer rates are over twice as high, and screening coverage is lower, in Maori women compared to other women in New Zealand, whereas uptake of HPV vaccine is higher in Maori females. We aimed to assess the impact of HPV vaccination and the proposed transition to 5-yearly primary HPV screening in Maori and other women in New Zealand, at current participation levels; and additionally to investigate which improvements to participation in Maori females (in vaccination, screening, or surveillance for screening-defined higher-risk women) would have the greatest impact on cervical cancer incidence/mortality.
   Methods: An established model of HPV vaccination and cervical screening in New Zealand was adapted to fit observed ethnicity-specific data. Ethnicity-specific models were used to estimate the long-term impact of vaccination and screening (vaccination coverage 63% vs 47%; five-year screening coverage 68% vs 81% in Maori vs European/Other women, respectively).
   Results: Shifting from cytology to HPV-based screening is predicted to reduce cervical cancer incidence by 17% (14%) in Maori (European/Other) women, respectively. The corresponding reductions due to vaccination and HPV-based screening combined were 58% (44%), but at current participation levels long-term incidence would remain almost twice as high in Maori women (6.1/100,000 compared to 3.1/100,00 in European/Other women). Among strategies we examined, the greatest impact came from high vaccine coverage and achieving higher attendance by Maori women under surveillance for screen-detected abnormalities.
   Conclusion: Relative reductions in cervical cancer due to vaccination and HPV-based screening are predicted to be greater in Maori than in European/Other women. While these interventions have the potential to substantially reduce between-group differences, cervical cancer incidence would remain higher in Maori women. These findings highlight the importance of multiple approaches and the potential influence of factors beyond HPV prevention. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Over the last decades, pertussis showed periodic increases in its incidence among adults, despite being a vaccine-preventable disease.
   Methods: This phase III, multicenter, extension study (NCT00489970) was conducted in adults from the United States, followed at Year (Y) 5 and Y9 post-vaccination with a dose of reduced-antigen-content tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine containing either 3 (Tdap-B group) or 5 pertussis components (Tdap-A group). Willing participants in Tdap groups and newly-recruited participants (Control group) received one Tdap-B dose at Y9. Antibody persistence (at Y5 and Y9) and safety of Tdap-B at Y9 were assessed. Non-inferiority of immune response elicited by 2 Tdap doses was evaluated at Y9: (i) versus one Tdap-B dose for diphtheria and tetanus in terms of seroprotection rates; (ii) for all antigens in terms of booster response rates (Tdap-B and Tdap-A groups versus Control group); and (iii) for pertussis antigens in terms of geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) versus a 3-dose series of a combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa) administered during infancy.
   Results: 1257 participants were enrolled at Y5 and 809 participants were vaccinated at Y9. Seroprotection rates in both Tdap groups were >= 98.4% and >= 98.0% (Y5) and >= 98.3% and >= 98.1% (Y9) for diphtheria and tetanus, respectively. For pertussis antigens, antibody concentrations above assay cut-offs were observed for >= 76.6% (Y5) and >= 84.9% (Y9) of participants in Tdap groups. At Y9, one month post-Tdap vaccination, comparable seroprotection/seropositivity rates and antibody GMCs were observed among groups. Non-inferiority of immune responses in both Tdap groups was demonstrated when compared to the Control group for diphtheria and tetanus and to a 3-dose DTPa series for pertussis antigens. Non-inferiority criteria in terms of booster response were not met for all antigens. No safety concerns were raised.
   Conclusion: A second dose of Tdap-B administered in adults, 9 years after initial Tdap vaccination, is immunogenic and well-tolerated. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

AB As a successful prevention strategy for controlling the highly contagious and pathogenic disease of spring viremia of carp (SVC), DNA vaccines reported in recent years could trigger protective responses against SVC with the means of injection. However, there remains many concerns and uncertainties related to DNA vaccination as well as injection is labor intensive, costly and not suitable to vaccinate large numbers of fish. Therefore, more efficient and safe prophylactic measures should be urgently investigated. In this research, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as the candidate SWCNTs-pET32a-G subunit vaccine carrier were administrated via bath (1, 5, 10, 20, 40 mg L-1) or injection (1, 4, 8, 12, 20 mu g) in common carp juvenile, and the different immune treatments to induce immunoprotective effect were analyzed. The results showed that SWCNTs-pET32a-G could enter fish body after immersion for 10 h, furthermore, compared to control groups, antibody levels, the non-specific immune parameters (complement activity, superoxide dismutase activity and alkaline phosphatase activity), and immune-related genes (especially the TNF-alpha and IFNg2b) in vaccinated groups were significantly enhanced in fish immunized with SWCNTs-subunit vaccine. In addition, as a promising carrier, SWCNTs can increase the immune protective effect of naked subunit vaccine by ca. 16% in bath immunization group and by ca. 23% in injection group. This study suggests that SWCNTs-vaccine may represent a potentially efficient immersion vaccine against viral pathogens of fish in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertusiss (Tdap) vaccine is recommended during each pregnancy, regardless of prior receipt. Data on reactogenicity and immunogenicity, particularly after repeated Tdap, are limited. We compared local injection-site and systemic reactions and serologic response following Tdap in (1) pregnant and nonpregnant women and (2) pregnant women by self-reported prior Tdap receipt.
   Study design: Pregnant women (gestational age 20-34 weeks) and nonpregnant women receiving Tdap were enrolled in this observational study. Injection-site and systemic reactions were assessed for one week post-vaccination. Pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, fimbriae, tetanus and diphtheria specific IgG antibody titers were determined by standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and 28 days post-vaccination. Reactogenicity and serologic responses were compared by pregnancy status, and within pregnant women by self-reported prior Tdap receipt.
   Results: 374 pregnant and 225 nonpregnant women were vaccinated. Severe local or systemic reactions or "any" fever were uncommon (<3% for both groups). Moderate/severe injection-site pain was significantly higher in pregnant (17.9%) versus nonpregnant (11.1%) women, but did not prompt a healthcare visit. Proportions of other moderate/severe or any severe reactions were not significantly higher in pregnant compared to nonpregnant women. Moderate/severe (including pain) and severe reactions were not significantly higher in pregnant women receiving repeat versus first-time Tdap. Antibody titers increased from baseline to post-vaccination for all vaccine antigens in pregnant and nonpregnant women; post vaccination titers against pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin were significantly higher in nonpregnant versus pregnant women (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Tdap was well-tolerated in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Pregnant women were more likely to report moderate/severe pain at the Tdap injection-site compared with nonpregnant women, but did not necessitate medical visits. Prior Tdap receipt did not increase occurrence of moderate/severe local or systemic reactions in pregnant women. Serologic responses to all vaccine antigens were robust.

AB The CONSTANS-LIKE (COL) gene has an important role both in regulation flowering through photoperiodic control and response to abiotic stress. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of maize COL gene family and identified 19 non-redundant ZmCOL genes, which were unequally distributed on ten maize chromosomes. Analysis of compound phylogenetic tree (maize, sorghum, rice and Arabidopsis) showed high bootstrap, as well as conserved domain and semblable gene structures among members within the same Glade, revealing that COL genes in same Glade were from the common ancestral and prior to the divergence of monocots and dicots lineages. Calculation of Ka/Ks ratio demonstrated that most duplicated ZmCOLs experienced purifying selection, which suggested limited functional divergence after duplication events. Comparing interspecies gene collinearity between three major grasses species, extensive microsynteny was detected among maize, sorghum and rice COL-containing segments. Additionally, several light-responsive and one ABA-responsive cis-elements could be detected for ZmCOL genes in group A. Therefore, qRT-PCR was performed to explore the expression patterns of ZmCOL genes in group A under light/dark conditions and ABA treatment. Our results laid the foundation for functional characterization of ZmCOL proteins and uncovering the biological roles of COL genes in response to stress in future.

AB Existing data indicate that a Ca2+ signal stimulates ecdysteroid hormone production by crustacean molting glands (Y-organs). Ca2+ signaling is dependent on a tightly regulated Ca2+ gradient, with intracellular free Ca2+ maintained at a low basal level (typically sub-micromolar). This is achieved through the action of proteins intrinsic to the plasma membrane and the membranes of organelles. One such protein, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), pumps Ca2+ from cytosol to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. As a step toward understanding Ca2+-mediated regulation of ecdysteroidogenesis, we have begun investigating Ca2+ transport proteins in Y-organs. In studies reported here, we used a PCR-based strategy to clone from Y-organs of the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) a cDNA encoding a putative SERCA protein. The cloned Cas-SERCA cDNA (3806 bp) includes a 3057-bp open reading frame that encodes a 1019-residue protein (Cas-SERCA). The conceptually translated protein has a predicted molecular mass of 111.42 x 10(3) and contains all signature domains of an authentic SERCA, including ten transmembrane domains and a phosphorylation site at aspartate 351. A homology model of Cas-SERCA closely resembles models of related SERCA proteins. Phylogenetic analysis shows Cas-SERCA clusters with SERCA proteins from other arthropods. An assessment of tissue distribution indicates the Cas-SERCA transcript is widely distributed across tissues. Studies using quantitative PCR showed Cas-SERCA transcript abundance increased significantly in Y-organs activated by eyestalk ablation, a pattern consistent with the hypothesis that Cas-SERCA functions to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis in Y-organs.

AB Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) is a common multifactorial disorder. Degradation of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is a key event in the progression of renal disease. A functional polymorphism at position -1607 1G/2G, -1306 C/T and -1171 5A/6A has been shown to alter the transcriptional activity of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3 respectively, and also associated with several diseases contributing to inter-individual differences in susceptibility to type 2 DN. The study population consisted of 310 type 2 DN patients and 310 healthy controls. Genotypes of MMP-1, 2 and 3 were determined by PCR-RFLP assay. Gene interactions, Linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis were carried out by MDR analysis and Haploview software respectively. The promoter binding sites of MMP genes were determined by using Alibaba 2.1 and the gene-gene interactions of MMPs were analyzed by GeneMania. The individuals carrying 2G allele of -1607, C allele of -1306 and 5A/6A genotype of -1171 were associated with type 2 DN susceptibility and progression from stage 1 to stage 5. 2G-5A haplotypes of MMP-1 (-1607 1G/2G) and MMP-3 (-1171 5A/6A) gene polymorphisms were found to be significantly predominant in the disease group. MDR analysis revealed a strong interaction between the genes under study. 2G allele of MMP-1, C allele of MMP-2 and 5A/6A genotype of MMP-3 were associated with susceptibility and disease progression of type 2 DN and might be used as potential markers for risk prediction and prognosis of type 2 DN.

AB Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the nervous, musculoskeletal and gastroenteric systems. Affected individuals show normal neonatal development for 6-18 months followed by sudden growth arrest, psychomotor retardation and a broad spectrum of clinical features. Sequence variants in MECP2 gene have been identified as the major genetic etiology accounting for 90-95% of patients. Apart from MECP2, pathogenic sequence variants and copy number variants of FOXG1 gene lead to congenital type of Rett syndrome which is a more severe form and characterised by absence of early normal development as seen in classical Rett syndrome. In this report we describe a female child with global developmental delay, microcephaly and myoclonic seizures harbouring a 5 Mb deletion in 14q12 locus resulting in deletion of single copy of brain specific genes FOXG1, PRKD1 and NOVA]. Whole exome sequencing ruled out any possible role of other pathogenic single nucleotide variants and/or indels as the etiology for the observed phenotype. However, copy number variation analysis from the whole exome data detected a similar to 5 Mb microdeletion at the long arm of chromosome 14q12 region. The deletion was confirmed through array Comparative Genomic Hybridization and validated by quantitative PCR. Further, parents were analysed for mosaicism through metaphase Fluorescence in-situ Hybridisation. Our report broadens the phenotype of atypical Rett syndrome and reiterates the role of exome sequencing not only in detection of point mutation/small indels but also for detection of large deletions/duplication in coding regions.

AB Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Although the etiology of glaucoma is incompletely understood, it is known that the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the trabecular meshwork, oxidative stress, TGF beta signaling pathways, and apoptosis are important components of glaucoma pathogenesis. These components appear to be interrelated, but knowledge on their interactions remains incomplete. Relevant to this gap in knowledge, LTBP2, glaucoma causing gene, may also be related to the mentioned components of glaucoma pathogenesis because of its putative roles in TGF beta signaling and ECM functions. This background prompted us to further query interactions among some molecules and pathways thought to be important in glaucoma etiology, with emphasis on oxidative stress and LTBP2. To this end, effects of LTBP2 siRNA knock-down, oxidative stress induction, TGF beta 2 and gremlin exposures on canonical TGF beta and BMP signaling pathways, expression of ECM related genes, and apoptosis were assayed in primary human trabecular meshwork cell cultures. We found that oxidative stress induction and LTBP2 knockdown both affected all the processes queried, and that their affects paralleled one another. We suggest that effects of both oxidative stress and LTBP2 knockdown on the ECM and apoptosis may be mediated by TGF beta and BMP signaling pathway activation.

AB Abnormal regulation of gene expression is essential for tumorigenesis. Several studies indicate that regulation of oncogene expression and neoplastic transformation are controlled by subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (elFs). Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is the largest (800 kDa) and the most complex mammalian initiation factor. It is composed of 13 non-identical polypeptides designated as eIF3a-m and plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis that bridges the 43S pre-initiation complex and eIF4F-bound mRNA. However, the functional roles of individual subunits are not yet very clear. This review presents on several of aberrant expressed eIF3 subunits which are detected in various human cancers and the associated mechanisms have been acknowledged or are still not sure. Finally, identifying novel targets and biomarkers for caner is of great importance in early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. eIF3 may be a novel target molecule in drug development for cancer treatment and prevention.

AB Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a critical coenzyme for all living cells. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) functions as a key enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD biosynthesis. Cancer cells have higher rate of NAD consumption and therefore NAMPT is essential for their survival. Thus, we investigated the effect of NAMPT inhibition by miR-206 on breast cancer cell survival. Breast cancer cells were transfected with miR-206 mimic, inhibitor and their negative controls. NAMPT levels were assessed by real-time PCR as well as western blotting. Cell survival assay and quantification of NAD level were performed by using colorimetric methods. Apoptosis assay was performed by labeling cells with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide followed by the flow cytometric analysis. Bioinformatics analysis was done to assess whether NAMPT 3'-UTR is a direct target of miR-206 and the results were confirmed by the luciferase reporter assay. NAMPT 3'-UTR was shown to be a direct target of miR-206. miR-206 reduced NAMPT expression at the protein level, leading to a significant decrease in the intracellular NAD level and subsequent decline in cell survival and induction of apoptosis. Targeting of NAMPT-mediated NAD salvage pathway by miR-206 might provide a new insight in the possible molecular mechanism of breast cancer cell growth regulation. This pathway might provide a new approach for breast cancer therapy.

AB TMPRSS6 gene mutations can result in iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and cause an increased iron-regulatory hormone, hepcidin, levels. TMPRSS6 encodes a serine protease, matriptase-2, which functions as negative regulatory protein of hepcidin transcription. Thus, TMPRSS6 variations might be risk factors for IDA. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of rs855791, rs4820268, rs5756506, rs2235324, rs2413450, rs2111833, rs228919, and rs733655 SNPs in TMPRSS6 gene with IDA susceptibility and iron-related clinical parameters. The study consisted of 150 IDA patients and 100 healthy controls. We analyzed the genotype distributions by using Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time PCR) technique. We did not find any statistically differences for all SNPs between patients and controls (P > 0.05). In IDA patients, variations rs855791 and rs2413450 were associated with increased RBC (P = 0.03) and TIBC (P = 0.04), respectively. Also, increased of TIBC for rs4820268 (P < 0.05). On the other hand, in control group, rs5756506 was associated with two parameters, Hb (P = 0.02) and Hct (P = 0.03). We did not find markedly hepcidin levels in IDA patients compared to controls (P = 0.32). Our findings suggest that TMPRSS6 variations may not be risk factors for IDA. However, TMPRSS6 polymorphisms are associated with increased many iron-related hematological parameters.

AB Incorrect paternity assignment in cattle can significantly influence the accuracy of genetic evaluation. Recent advances in high-throughput technology have facilitated the identification of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and their applications for filiation and individual identification. We genotyped 1074 bulls from a reference population of Chinese Simmental cattle for genomic selection using a BovineSNP770K BeadChip. Among them, a total of 136 bulls were randomly selected to design a suitable low-density SNP panel for paternity testing in Simmental cattle. Our results showed that 50 SNPs were determined to be the most informative markers in parental testing, with an accuracy of 99.89% for CPE (cumulative probability of exclusion) in the unknown female parent case. The 50 highly informative SNP markers were distributed across 25 chromosomes, and the mean intermarker distance per chromosome was 26.72 Mb. The average minor allele frequency (MAF), expected heterozygosity (HE), and polymorphic information content (PIC) values were 0.3748, 0.4998, and 0.4818, respectively. Finally, the 50 identified SNPs were used to estimate paternity for the remaining 938 of 1074 bulls from 23 farms. Our results revealed that 76.75% of the 938 bulls were assigned parentage to the pedigree sires with 95% confidence, and the rate of pedigree record mistakes ranged from 9.52%-39.29% in different herds. Our study is the first attempt to provide valuable insights into the extraction of informative markers through the application of high-density SNP chips for paternity testing in Chinese Simmental cattle.

DE Cumulative Fourier power spectrum; Moment vectors; DNA sequences;

ID SEQUENCES; ALIGNMENT
AB Analyzing phylogenetic relationships using mathematical methods has always been of importance in bioinformatics. Quantitative research may interpret the raw biological data in a precise way. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is used frequently to analyze biological evolutions, but is very time-consuming. When the scale of data is large, alignment methods cannot finish calculation in reasonable time. Therefore, we present a new method using moments of cumulative Fourier power spectrum in clustering the DNA sequences. Each sequence is translated into a vector in Euclidean space. Distances between the vectors can reflect the relationships between sequences. The mapping between the spectra and moment vector is one-to-one, which means that no information is lost in the power spectra during the calculation. We cluster and classify several datasets including Influenza A, primates, and human rhinovirus (HRV) datasets to build up the phylogenetic trees. Results show that the new proposed cumulative Fourier power spectrum is much faster and more accurately than MSA and another alignment-free method known as k-mer. The research provides us new insights in the study of phylogeny, evolution, and efficient DNA comparison algorithms for large genomes. The computer programs of the cumulative Fourier power spectrum are available at GitHub (https://github.com/YaulabTsinghua/cumulativeFourier-power-spectrum).

AB Metal-based photothermal therapy has been widely used in the biomedicine field and includes gold nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles and copper sulfide nanoparticles. Furthermore, the coordination bonding-based metal nanocomplex is a new generation of photothermal agents for cancer therapy due to its high photothermal transduction efficiency, good biocompatibility, biodegradation and bioactivity. In this study, we designed a coordination bonding-based copper (Cu(II))-carboxylate ternary architecture, which consists of a conjugate dopamine-modified nontoxic hyaluronic acid, copper ions and citric acid. When the Cu(II) coordinated with the carboxyl groups, the splitting d orbitals energy gap of Cu(II) and the capability of electron transition were enhanced, which can increase the extinction ability in the near-infrared region for enhancing photothermal therapy. Moreover, the degradation of hyaluronic acid by hyaluronidase highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment led to the release of Cu-citric acid complexes, thus exhibiting an additional chemotherapeutic effect. The nanocomplexes possessed high-performance photothermal conversion, determined to be 21.3%. The solution could be easily heated to above 42 degrees C, which was sufficient to ablate the cancer cells. An obvious decrease in cell viability was observed in B16F10 cells incubated with the nanocomplexes under laser at the lower concentration of 20 mu g/mL Cu(II). Upon near-infrared laser irradiation, the nanocomplexes showed high photothermal therapy and chemotherapeutic efficacy for breast cancer in vivo. This study demonstrated that the Cu(II)-carboxylate coordination nanocomplex is a promising new effective and facilely prepared thermochemotherapy agent for combination therapy against cancer.

AB A facile continuous production of soy peptide nanogels was demonstrated using a multi-inlet vortex micromixer for the entrapment of active ingredients. The full flow regime in the micromixer was systematically studied to understand the flow impact on nanogel size, drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency. Ibuprofen was chosen as a model drug to demonstrate encapsulation capability. The study showed that the nanogel size, drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency did not alter significantly as long as the flow rates were in transition and turbulent regimes. The driving force behind the folding of peptides within the microenvironment is kinetic mixing with high flow rates, which dominates in comparison to molecular diffusion, nucleation, and growth. Moreover, the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of the soy peptides determined the drug encapsulation efficiency and the drug loading efficiency, which did not vary much under different manufacturing parameters. Both characteristics are beneficial to mass production of drug-entrapped peptide. In a 50% water-ethanol mixture, the encapsulation efficiency achieved 70% and the drug loading efficiency was up to 25% in transition and turbulent flow regimes. This work opens the avenues to continuous production of drug-entrapped soy peptide nanogels using a multi-inlet vortex micromixer.

AB This review outlines recently developed Prussian blue nanoparticle (PB NPs)-based multimodal imaging-guided chemo-photothermal strategies for cancer diagnosis and treatment in order to provide insight into the future of the field. The primary limitation of existing therapeutics is the lack of selectivity in drug delivery: they target healthy and cancerous cells alike. In this paper, we provide a thorough review of diverse synthetic and surface engineering techniques for PB NP fabrication. We have elucidated the various targeting approaches employed to deliver the therapeutic and imaging ligands into the tumor area, and outlined methods for enhancement of the tumor ablative ability of the NPS, including several important combinatorial approaches. In addition, we have summarized different in vitro and in vivo effects of PB NP-based therapies used to overcome both systemic and tumor-associated local barriers. An important new approach - PB NP-based immune drug delivery, which is an exciting and promising strategy to overcome cancer resistance and tumor recurrence - has been discussed. Finally, we have discussed the current understanding of the toxicological effects of PB NPs and PB NP-based therapeutics. We conclude that PB NP-based multimodal imaging-guided chemo-photothermal therapy offers new treatment strategies to overcome current hurdles in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

AB The investigation of the miscibility between active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's) and polymeric excipients is of great interest for the formulation and development of amorphous solid dispersions, especially in the context of the prediction of the stability of these systems. Two different methods were applied to determine the miscibility between model compounds poly(vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate) (PVPVA) and indomethacin (IND), viz. the measurement of the glass transition temperature (T-g) and the melting point depression method framed on the Flory-Huggins theory. Measurement of the glass transition temperatures of the binary blends showed the formation of an amorphous single phase system between the PVPVA and the IND regardless of the composition. Variation of T-g with the composition was well described by the Gordon-Taylor equation leading to the error of concluding lack of intermolecular interactions between the materials. Application of the Brostow-ChiuKalogeras-Vassilikou-Dova (BCKV) model shows a negative interaction parameter (a(0)) suggesting the presence of drug-drug intermolecular interactions. Application of the melting point depression method within the framework of the Flory-Huggins theory proved the miscibility of the system at temperatures close to the melting point of IND.

AB Gold NPs have great potential in biomedical applications. PAMAM dendrimers are spherical, hyper branched macromolecules which can encapsulate therapeutic molecules while stabilizing metal nanoparticle such as gold NPs. The aim of the current study was to investigate the theranostic capability of curcumin-loaded dendrimer-gold hybrid structure.
   Dendrimer-gold hybrid structure was synthesized by complexing AuCl4- ions with PEGylated amine-terminated generation 5 poly (amidoamine) dendrimer. The resultant hybrid system was loaded with curcumin. The curcumin-loaded PEGylated Au dendrimer was further conjugated to MUC-1 aptamer in order to target the colorectal adenocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo.
   Obtained results demonstrated that the targeted theranostic agent was accumulated in HT29 and C26 cells in vitro and showed higher cellular cytotoxicity in comparison with non-targeted system. On the other hand, in vivo experiment demonstrated the potential of targeted theranostic system in CT-scan tumor imaging as well as cancer therapy.
   Findings from this study suggested that MUC-1 targeted curcumin-loaded PEGylated Au dendrimers have good X-ray attenuation and is desirable probe for CT imaging while demonstrating high therapeutic index against colorectal cancer adenocarcinoma.

AB Berberine hydrochloride (Brb) is a well-known herbal drug that holds a great promise in the recent years thanks to its various pharmacological actions. Currently, Brb is extensively researched as a natural surrogate with evidenced potentiality against numerous types of skin diseases including skin cancer. However, Brb's high aqueous solubility and limited permeability hinder its clinical topical application. In the current work, to enhance Brb's dermal availability, hydrophobic ion pairing approach was implemented combining the privileges of altering the solubility characteristics of Brb and the nanometric size that is usually gained during the ion pairing precipitation process. Sodium oleate (SO) was selected as the complexing agent due to its low toxicity and skin penetrating characteristics. Ion paired berberine oleate complex (Brb-OL) was prepared by simple precipitation technique. Brb-OL complex formation was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and saturation solubility studies. It was found that Brb-OL complex formed at stoichiometric binding between oleate and Brb had an average particle size of 195.9 nm and zeta potential of - 53.6 mV. The proposed Brb-OL showed 251-fold increase in saturation solubility in n-octanol which confirmed the augmented lipid solubility of the complex compared with free drug. Comparative in-vitro release study showed that Brb-OL complex had much slow and sustained release profile compared to that of free Brb. Furthermore, ex-vivo permeation study using rat skin revealed the enhanced skin permeation of ion-paired Brb-OL complex compared with free Brb. In-vivo study on healthy rats confirmed that topical application of hydrogels enriched with Brb-OL had superior skin penetration and deposition than free Brb as revealed by confocal microscope. Conclusively, ion pair formation between Brb and oleate lead to the formation of more lipophilic Brb-OL complex with nanometric particle size which is expected to be a major progressive step towards the development of a topical berberine formulation.

AB This work describes the formulation and evaluation of dissolving microneedle patches (MNs) for intradermal delivery of heat-inactivated bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain PA01, was used as a model bacterium. Utilising a simple, cost effective fabrication process, P. aeruginosa was heat-inactivated and formulated into dissolving MNs, fabricated from aqueous blends of 20% w/w poly(methylvinylether/maleic acid). The resultant MNs were of sufficient mechanical strength to consistently penetrate a validated skin model Parafilm M (R), inserting to a depth of between 254 and 381 mu m MNs were successfully inserted into murine skin and partially dissolved. Analysis of MN dissolution kinetics in murine ears via optical coherence tomography showed almost complete MN dissolution 5 min post-insertion. Mice were vaccinated using these optimised MNs by application of one MN to the dorsal surface of each ear (5 min). Mice were subsequently challenged intranasally (24 h) with a live culture of P. aeruginosa (2 x 10(6) colony forming units). Bacterial load in the lungs of mice vaccinated with P. aeruginosa MNs was significantly (p = 0.0059) lower than those of their unvaccinated counterparts. This proof of concept work demonstrates the potential of dissolving MNs for intradermal vaccination with heat-inactivated bacteria. MNs may be a cost effective, potentially viable delivery system, which could easily be implemented in developing countries, allowing a rapid and simplified approach to vaccinating against a specific pathogen.

AB To understand the quality, efficacy, and safety of liposomal drugs, it is necessary to develop a robust and accurate method for the separation and the quantification of unencapsulated and liposome-associated drugs (or liposomal encapsulated drugs). Conventional methods involve separation of unencapsulated and liposome-associated drug using solid phase extraction and further drug quantification. This is a lengthy process, and sometimes solid phase extraction induces drug leakage from the liposomes causing erroneous results. In this study, a capillary electrophoresis (CE) with UV-Vis detection method was developed for the simultaneous separation and quantification of unencapsulated drug from liposome-associated drug using a doxorubicin-conraining liposome formulation as the model drug. CE separates the unencapsulated drug and liposomal drugs based on their electrophoretic mobility under the electric field. Liposomal drugs were diluted to the appropriate concentrations with running buffer or 5% dextrose before hydrodynamic sample injection. Using a high-sensitivity detection cell, the doxorubicin detection sensitivity was enhanced about 10-fold compared to the conventional on-column UV-Vis detection with a 75 mu m i.d. capillary column. The optimal separation of unencapsulated doxorubicin from liposome-associated doxorubicin with minimal perturbation of liposomes was accomplished using phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 6.5) in the presence of 10% sucrose.

   MANAGEMENT
AB The development of new oral insulin delivery systems could bring significant benefits to insulin-dependent patients due to the simplicity of the method, avoidance of pain caused by parenteral administration and maintenance of optimal therapeutic levels for a longer period. However, administration of such therapeutic proteins orally remains a challenge because insulin (Ins) is a very sensitive molecule and can be easily degraded under the existing pH conditions in the stomach and intestines. Moreover, due to the large size of insulin, intestinal epithelium permeability is very low. This could be improved by immobilizing insulin in the mesoporous silica pores (MSN), acting as a shield to protect the molecule integrity from the proteolytic degradation existing in the stomach and upper part of the small intestine. Due to the high adsorption capacity of insulin, biocompatibility, ease of functionalization with various organic and/or inorganic groups, high mechanical and chemical resistance, adjustable pore size and volume, MSN is considered an ideal candidate for the development of controlled release systems that are sensitive to various stimuli (pH, temperature) as well as to glucose. Modifying MSN surfaces by coating with various mucoadhesive polymers (chitosan, alginate, etc.) will also facilitate interaction with the intestinal mucus and improve intestinal retention time. Moreover, the development of glucose-responsive systems for achieving MSN-based self-regulated insulin delivery, decorated with various components serving as sensors - glucose oxidase (GOD(x)) and phenylboronic acid (PBA) that can control the insulin dosage, avoiding overdose leading to serious hypoglycemia. MSN have also been tested for application as biosensors for glucose monitoring.

AB Diabetes is a chronic medical condition, which is characterised by high blood sugar level. Exogenous insulin is commonly administered subcutaneously for the management of diabetes. However, daily injections of insulin could result in poor patient compliance and various side-effects. Although oral administration offers benefits, insulin is vulnerable to enzymatic degradation, chemical instability and poor gastrointestinal absorption. There is an absence of reviews on insulin-loaded liposomal drug carriers, despite that fact that liposomes have gained considerable attention recently for oral delivery of insulin. They demonstrate favourable characteristics, such as versatility, biocompatibility, protective effect against enzymatic degradation, and cell-specific targeting. In this review, we will explore the status quo for oral delivery of insulin-loaded liposomal formulations, followed by discussing the state of art of these vesicles. This review will provide a detailed overview on insulin-loaded conventional liposomes, and 7 types of current novel formulations. Lastly, the future direction for oral bioa-vailability enhancement and development of such nanoscale drug delivery systems will be discussed. Further optimisation in the drug entrapment efficiency and gastrointestinal absorption will be required to develop a clinically successful oral liposome-insulin formulation.

AB Poor water solubility, short half-life, and low drug efficacy posed a challenge for clinical application of curcumin (CUR). In this work, a kind of CUR prodrug was synthesized by coupling two CUR molecules with a monothioether linker for glutathione (GSH)-responsive drug delivery. The synthesized CUR prodrug (CUR-S-CUR dimer) could self-assemble into the homogeneous spherical nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous solution followed by surface functionalization of trace amounts of DSPE-PEG. These CUR-S-CUR@PEG NPs exhibited a small particle size of similar to 100 nm, high CUR-loading content of similar to 78 wt%, and good colloid stability. Moreover, the CUR-S-CUR@PEG NPs demonstrated much more efficient cellular uptake and intracellular/nuclear drug delivery compared with free CUR, indicating the advantages of small molecular prodrug assembly. In addition, the GSH with high concentration in tumor cells could trigger the disassembly of CUR-S-CUR@PEG NPs. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity assays indicated that the CUR-S-CUR@PEG NPs exhibited the comparable inhibition effect of tumor cell proliferation with free CUR due to sustained drug release. Therefore, these stimuli-responsive CUR-S-CUR@ PEG NPs might have promising potential for highly efficient intracellular drug delivery and controlled drug release in cancer therapy.

AB The small intestine mucosal barrier is physiologically regulated by the luminal conditions, where intestinal factors, such as diet and luminal tonicity, can affect mucosal permeability. The intestinal barrier may also be affected by absorption-modifying excipients (AME) in oral drug delivery systems. Currently, there is a gap in the understanding of how AMEs interact with the physiological regulation of intestinal electrolyte transport and fluid flux, and epithelial permeability. Therefore, the objective of this single-pass perfusion study in rat was to investigate the effect of three AMEs on the intestinal mucosal permeability at different luminal tonicities (100, 170, and 290 mOsm). The effect was also evaluated following luminal administration of a nicotinic receptor antagonist, mecamylamine, and after intravenous administration of a COX-2 inhibitor, parecoxib, both of which affect the enteric neural activity involved in physiological regulation of intestinal functions. The effect was evaluated by changes in intestinal lumen-to-blood transport of six model compounds, and blood-to-lumen clearance of Cr-51-EDTA (a mucosal barrier marker). Luminal hypotonicity alone increased the intestinal epithelial transport of Cr-51-EDTA. This effect was potentiated by two AMEs (SDS and caprate) and by parecoxib, while it was reduced by mecamylamine. Consequently, the impact of enteric neural activity and luminal conditions may affect nonclinical determinations of intestinal permeability. In vivo predictions based on animal intestinal perfusion models can be improved by considering these effects. The in vivo relevance can be increased by treating rats with a COX-2 inhibitor prior to surgery. This decreases the risk of surgery-induced ileus, which may affect the physiological regulation of mucosal permeability.

AB Development of efficient ocular drug delivery system for antifungal drugs becomes a must nowadays to face and eradicate the widely spread ophthalmic fungal infections. Itraconazole, a triazole antifungal, is struggling to penetrate the cornea and subsequently, its efficacy is limited. The aim of this study was to enhance Itraconazole corneal penetration through utilizing the minimum surfactant amount in presence of beta-cyclodextrin which acted as a dissolution and permeation enhancer. beta-Cyclodextrin consolidated micellar dispersions (CCMD) were prepared after an initial screening to select the composition of surfactant(s). The preparation was done according to a modified melt dispersion technique. The prepared CCMD were characterized through the analysis of their particle size, zeta potential and solubilization efficiency. The optimum formula was chosen based on a factorial response surface analysis and it was composed of 17:1 w/w surfactant/drug, 30:1 w/w cyclodextrin/drug ratios and 0.02% polyethylene oxide. This formula was subjected to in vitro characterization including release, imaging by transmission electron microscope, mucoadhesion, stability, in addition to the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. Moreover, the ex vivo/in vivo permeation, safety and efficacy profiles were determined. The optimized CCMD formula was found to be significantly safe, stable, mucoadhesive and efficient to permeate the drug through rabbits' corneas. Consequently, the optimized CCMD formulation can be a promising, safe and efficient platform for the transcorneal delivery of lipophilic drugs including most antifungals.

AB Dandruff is a common condition, affecting up to half the global population of immunocompetent adults at some time during their lives and it has been highly correlated with the over-expression of the fungus Malassezia spp. Climbazole (CBZ) is used as an antifungal and preservative agent in many marketed formulations for the treatment of dandruff. While the efficacy of CBZ in vitro and in vivo has previously been reported, limited information has been published about the uptake and deposition of CBZ in the skin. Hence, our aim was to investigate the skin permeation of CBZ as well as the influence of various solvents on CBZ skin delivery. Four solvents were selected for the permeability studies of CBZ, namely propylene glycol (PG), octyl salicylate (OSal), Transcutol (R) P (TC) and polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG). The criteria for selection were based on their wide use as excipients in commercial formulations, their potential to act as skin penetration enhancers and their favourable safety profiles. 1% (w/v) solutions of CBZ were applied under infinite and finite dose conditions using Franz type diffusion cells to human and porcine skin. In line with the topical use of CBZ as an antidandruff agent, comparatively low amounts of CBZ penetrated across the skin barrier ( < 1% of the applied dose of CBZ). Finite dose studies resulted in a higher extraction of CBZ from human skin compared with infinite dose studies (p < 0.05). CBZ was also taken up to a higher extent in porcine skin ( > 7-fold) compared with human skin (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, no statistical differences were observed in the amounts that permeated across the different membranes. These preliminary results confirm the potential of simple formulations of CBZ to target the outer layers of the epidermis. The PG and OSal formulations appear to be promising vehicles for CBZ in terms of overall skin extraction and penetration. Future work will expand the range of vehicles studied and explore the reasons underlying the retention of CBZ in the outer layers of the skin.

AB Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, which two main types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It has multifactorial etiologies, being essential the use of animal models and disease activity measures to develop new therapies. With this aim, the use of animal models in combination with non-invasive molecular imaging can play an important role in the development of new treatments.
   In this study, IBD was induced in rats using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and longitudinal [F-18]FDG PET/CT scans were conducted to assess disease progression post-TNBS administration. Afterwards, [F-18]FDG PET/CT scans were carried out after treatment with methylprednisolone to validate the model.
   In non-treated rats, SUVmax (Standardized Uptake Value) rapidly increased after IBD induction, being particularly significant (p < 0.01) on days 7-13 after induction. There were no significant differences between non-treated and treated IBD rats from days 0-3. Nevertheless, treated IBD rats showed a significant decrease in SUVmax between days 7-13 (p < 0.01). Histological examination showed descending and transverse colon as the most affected regions. There was a moderate (R-2 = 0.61) and strong (R-2 = 0.82) correlation of SUV(max )with Nancy grade (parameter for histological assessment of disease activity) and weight changes, respectively.
   In this study, we have performed the first longitudinal [F-18]FDG PET/CT assessment of TNBS-induced IBD in rats, demonstrating the potential role of preclinical molecular imaging for the evaluation of new therapies in combination with IBD rat models.

TI NLC versus nanoemulsions: Effect on physiological skin parameters during

AB Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and nano-sized emulsions based on monoacyl-phosphatidylcholine (MAPL) were tested for their effect on physiological skin parameters in vivo during daily application over four weeks. The influence of the basic formulations on transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration, sebum content and pH was determined once per week and after a recovery period of three weeks. In addition, confocal Raman spectroscopy was employed to evaluate natural moisturising factor and urea content. The results showed that the tested NLC systems with different MAPL content led to increased TEWL and decreased stratum corneum hydration, NMF and urea content. This effect was more pronounced for NLC with higher MAPL content and less pronounced for corresponding emulsions with increased oil phase volume. The observed effects indicate temporarily impaired barrier function; however, all effects were reversible after the treatment was finished.
   Additional tape stripping penetration experiments were performed on intact human forearm skin in vivo using the model substance curcumin. Higher total penetrated curcumin amounts were found for NLC-based formulations when compared to the emulsion. Comparative in vitro tape stripping data on porcine ear skin confirmed the trends observed in vivo. In summary, these findings suggest that the effect of the developed MAPLbased NLC and nano-sized emulsion on skin barrier function differs mildly in a one-time application setup, but may increase strongly during daily application over a longer treatment period.

AB Hypothyroidism is a chronic and debilitating disease that is estimated to affect 3% of the general population. Clinical experience has highlighted the synergistic value of combining triiodothyronine (T-3) and thyroxine (T-4) for persistent or recurrent symptoms. However, thus far a platform that enables the simultaneous and independent dosing of more than one drug for oral administration has not been developed. Thermal inkjet (TIJ) 2D printing is a potential solution to enable the dual deposition of T-3 and T-4 onto orodispersible films (ODFs) for therapy personalisation. In this study, a two-cartridge TIJ printer was modified such that it could print separate solutions of T-3 and T-4. Dose adjustments were achieved by printing solutions adjacent to each other, enabling therapeutic T-3 (15-50 mu g) and T-4 dosages (60-180 mu g) to be successfully printed. Excellent linearity was observed between the theoretical and measured dose for both T(3 )and T-4 (R-2 = 0.982 and 0.985, respectively) by changing the length of the print objective (Y-value). Rapid disintegration of the ODFs was achieved (< 45 s). As such, this study for the first time demonstrates the ability to produce personalised dose combinations by TIJ printing T-3 and T-4 onto the same substrate for oral administration.

AB Gastric floating tablets are a multifunctional dosage form with the merits of long-term gastric retention, sustained release and improved bioavailability though floating time and sustained release are usually not satisfied. Here we designed a novel gastric floating system by combining compressed tablets with 3D printed devices, wherein a riboflavin tablet was filled into a device. The table-filled device can be called a tablet-in-device (TiD) system. Commercial poly(lactic acid) filaments were used for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing of the body and cap of the device. Four types of TiD systems were prepared. The basic structures of them involved non-net, centrally symmetric double-net (including a peripheral sealed air-filled chamber and a centric net-on-both-sides chamber), single-net (including a sealed air-filled chamber on the top side and a net-on-one-side chamber on the bottom side), and eccentric double-net (including an eccentric net-on-both-sides chamber and an air-filled chamber). They were exquisitely designed after precise calculations of every chamber parameters according to the buoyant principle. All of them showed good floating ability, although only the latter two TiD systems were selected due to appropriate drug release. Compressed riboflavin tablets, consisting of riboflavin, lactose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and magnesium stearate, were prepared with the direct compaction method. All the tablets showed rapid drug release though the release was highly hindered by the devices in the TiD systems due to the barrier effect of devices and the tablet slurry formation. The single-net and double-net TiD systems achieved the cumulative release of 41% and 62% at 72 h, respectively, along with simultaneously well floating. In vivo long-term ( > 72 h) gastric floating function of TiD systems was further demonstrated on the rabbit models by the CT investigation. TiD systems are appropriate for oral administration of drugs with super long-term floating and controlled release in the gastric route.

AB Co-amorphous drug delivery systems are a promising approach to improve the dissolution rate and therefore potentially the oral bioavailability of poorly-water soluble drugs. Several low molecular weight excipients, for instance amino acids, have previously been shown to stabilize the amorphous form and increase the dissolution rate of drugs. In this study, the feasibility of aspartame, a methyl ester of the aspartic acid-phenylalanine dipeptide, as a co-former was investigated and compared with the respective single amino acids, both alone and in combination. The poorly water-soluble compounds mebendazole, tadalafil and piroxicam were chosen as model drugs. In contrast to the single amino acids or the physical mixture of both, all drug-aspartame mixtures became amorphous upon 90 min of ball milling. Only a single glass transition temperature (T-g) was detected by modulated differential scanning calorimetry, which indicates that a homogeneous single-phase co-amorphous system was obtained. Powder dissolution tests showed that the dissolution rates of the drugs from drug-aspartame co-amorphous samples were increased compared to crystalline drugs. Furthermore, supersaturation was observed for the mebendazole-aspartame and tadalafil-aspartame co-amorphous systems. In conclusion, aspartame has been shown to be a promising co-former in co-amorphous systems, superior to the single amino acids or their mixtures.

AB Bioengineered functionalized nanoparticles have extensively been proposed in recent years to efficiently deliver anti-cancer drugs to the tumour site, by targeting the cancer cells and improving the therapeutic efficiency of active molecules. In this work, polymeric poly (lactic-co- glycolic)-polyethyleneglycol (PLGA-PEG) nanoparticles were produced by nanoprecipitation and loaded with paclitaxel, following surface-functionalized with a monoclonal antibody targeting the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of intestinal epithelial cells. Physicochemical properties, cytotoxicity and targeting ability of the nanoparticles against two intestine epithelial carcinoma cell lines, CEA-expressing Caco-2 clone and non-CEA-expressing SW480, were assessed. Results showed successful production of nanoparticles around 200 nm, and close to charge neutrality, encapsulating up to 99% of paclitaxel. Functionalized nanoparticles were further constructed, demonstrating to be non-cytotoxic against intestinal cells. The targeting ability of functionalized nanoparticles to Caco-2 CEA expressing cells was confirmed by flow cytometry, in opposite to SW480 cells. Overall, the surface-modified PLGA-PEG nanoparticles with the CEA-targeting antibody were successfully developed as nanocarriers for paclitaxel and interacted with CEA expressing cells. This specific interaction provide these particles ability to be used as targeted systems for colorectal cancer therapeutics.

AB In current study a holistic material characterization approach was proposed and an extensive raw material property database was developed including a wide variety of APIs and excipients with different functionalities. In total 55 different materials were characterized and described by over 100 raw material descriptors related to particle size and shape distribution, specific surface area, bulk, tapped and true density, compressibility, electrostatic charge, moisture content, hygroscopicity, permeability, flowability and wall friction. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reveal similarities and dissimilarities between materials and to identify overarching properties. The developed PCA model allows to rationalize the number of critical characterization techniques in routine characterization and to identify surrogates for use during early drug product development stages when limited amounts of active pharmaceutical ingredients are available. Additionally, the developed database will be the basis to build predictive models for in silico process and formulation development based on (a selection of) property descriptors.

AB Based on characterization of a wide range of fillers and APIs, thirty divergent blends were composed and subsequently compressed on a rotary tablet press, varying paddle speed and turret speed. The tablet weight variability was determined of 20 grab samples consisting of each 20 tablets. Additionally, the bulk residence time, ejection force, pre-compression displacement, main compression force, die fill fraction and feed frame fill fraction were determined during each run. Multivariate data analysis was applied to investigate the relation between the process parameters, blend characteristics, product and process responses. Blends with metoprolol tartrate as API showed high ejection forces. This behavior could be linked to the high wall friction value of metoprolol tartrate. The main responses related to the die filling could be predicted via a PLS model based on blend characteristics. Tablet weight variability was highly correlated with the variability on pre-compression displacement and main compression force. A good predictive model for tablet weight variability was obtained taking the porosity, wall friction angle, flowability, density, compressibility and permeability into account. Additionally, turret speed and paddle speed were included in the calibration of the model. The applied approach can save resources (material, time) during early drug product development.

AB The pulmonary fate of inhaled poorly water-soluble drugs is not entirely clear. In this study, the main objective was to investigate the in vivo inhalation biopharmaceutics in the aspects of dissolution, mucociliary clearance, absorption and tissue binding using intratracheally administered budesonide and ciclesonide suspensions as model drugs. In doing so, this study first developed a method to differentiate between dissolved and undissolved ciclesonide in the lungs for evaluating in vivo dissolution. Following deposited in rat airways, the drug particles underwent rapid dissolution and mucociliary clearance, leading to the complete removal of drugs from the airways within 2 h and a limited absorption time less than 2 h. Upon dissolution, budesonide and ciclesonide were taken up and retained in the lung tissues for up to 12 h and 24 h, respectively. The in vivo dissolution profiles in the airways exhibited the sameness as the in vitro counterparts in a 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution as indicated by the similarity factor f2. The efficacy results in a lipopolysaccharide induced lung injury model showed that the duration of local anti-inflammatory was dependent on the drug levels in the lung tissues, but not on the in vitro/in vivo dissolution and plasma pharmacokinetics. The present results demonstrated that ciclesonide suspension has the potential to achieve once-daily dosing for nebulization therapy and the in vitro dissolution profile has limited usefulness in predicting in vitro-in vivo correlation.

AB The number of biologics in the therapeutic development pipeline is increasing including those delivered though inhalation (Morales, 2017; Fathe, 2016). Biologics comprise a broad variety of complex macromolecules with unique physicochemical characteristics. These distinctive characteristics control their pharmacological mechanisms of action, stability, and ultimately affect their processing, formulation, and delivery requirements. This review systematically covers crucial aspects of biologic powders formulations and dry powder inhalers which need to be taken into consideration to establish the drug loading and the payload to be delivered to reach the desired clinical dose.

AB The fine particle fraction is a key indicator of therapeutic effectiveness of inhaled pharmaceutical aerosols. This paper presents a fluorescence imaging technique to visualise and characterise the emission of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) fines in model formulations containing coarse lactose carrier and 1.5-2 mu m diameter fluorescent microspheres (model API fines). A two-camera arrangement was used to acquire simultaneous images of spatial and temporal distribution of model API fines and fluidised powder formulation near the mouthpiece exit of a DPI. Digital image analysis showed that the model API fines were released along with the bulk of the powder dose. More rapidly accelerating airflows were found to cause earlier release of API fines. The fluorescence imaging technique analyses a substantial fraction of the aerosol plume and was found to provide effective time-resolved characterisation of the de-aggregation and release of API fines with consistent results across a wide range of model API concentrations. Future studies should demonstrate the usefulness of the fluorescence imaging technique across different formulations and DPI devices.

AB Allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the only specific therapeutic way for house dust mite (HDM) allergy. To improve the efficacy of SIT, hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) were used as vehicles for HDM allergen. The HMSNs were prepared and characterized. The major HDM allergen (Der f2) was loaded onto HMSNs, and the drug loading capacity and release profile were determined. Then the Der f2 loaded HMSNs were injected subcutaneously to mouse model of Der f2 induced allergic asthma and the preventive effects were evaluated. Our results showed that HMSNs were spherical (100 nm) with pore diameter of 2.897 nm and successfully loaded with Der f2 protein. The loading capacity is 90 mu g Der f2/1 mg HMSNs. The Der f2 loaded on HMSNs released slowly in 72 h. Treatment with Der f2 loaded HMSNs could efficiently decrease Der f2 specific IgE levels, inflammatory cells infiltration in lung tissue, and Th2 cytokine IL4 levels in BALF. In the meanwhile, it could increase the Der f2 specific IgG levels, Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma levels, and induce proliferation of splenocytes to Der f2 accompanied by increased IFN-gamma levels. These results showed that Der f2 loaded HMSNs were efficient in preventing allergic inflammation, and HMSNs may be potential vehicles for SIT of HDM allergy.

AB Intravaginal rings (VRs) have been widely reported for administration of pharmaceutical drugs - most notably estrogens, progestogens and antiretrovirals - to the vagina for clinical benefit. Here, for the first time, we describe the design, manufacture and preclinical testing of VRs for sustained/controlled release of the cervical ripening agents isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) and misoprostol (MP), either singly or in combination. Matrix-type silicone elastomer VRs containing ISMN showed declining daily release rates, ranging from 31 to 168 mg (Day 1) to 3-25 mg (Day 11). Novel orifice-type rings, in which a MP-containing silicone elastomer core is partially exposed to the external environment by overmolding with a non-medicated silicone elastomer sheath containing orifices, provided relatively constant daily MP release rates over 14 days ( similar to 20 or 60 mu g/day depending on the formulation type). Combination VRs offered simultaneous release of both ISMN and MP over 14 days, with an almost constant MP release rate (60 mu g/day) and steadily declining daily ISMN release (295 mg on Day 1 and 24 mg on Day 11). The VR design can be readily tailored to provide sustained or controlled release of ISMN and MP at rates potentially useful for cervical ripening.

AB Many studies have shown that toxicities of anticancer drugs and their adverse effects are related to their chemical structure and high molecular weight that may result in a number of metabolites interacting with drug offtarget networks. These factors require further attention for advancing cancer treatment and decreasing toxicities caused by the molecular complexity of antineoplastic agents. Providing more target-selective and tolerable cancer therapy with fewer side effects would not only improve patients' compliance, but also would decrease cancer-remission rates. This review presents several antineoplastic agents and their metabolites with molecular weights greater than 500 g/mol, which reportedly cause more than fifteen types of adverse reactions during breast cancer therapy.

AB Extemporaneous preparations (EPs) of investigational drugs, which are compounded at the clinical study site by a pharmacist, are being increasingly used in early phase clinical studies to accelerate the development of new medicines. The successful application of EP strategies in clinical studies requires 'fit-for-purpose' formulation design and preparation processes, as well as administration procedures that are safe, flexible, cost-effective, and simple to adapt by a compounding pharmacist at the clinical site. DNS-7801 is a weakly basic investigational compound that exhibits a higher aqueous solubility at lower pH with its solubility dropping off precipitously with increase in pH. This phenomenon is known to result in potential risk of variable and decreased exposure in vivo. Combination of citrate buffer at pH 3.0 and hydroxypropylbetadex enabled formulation of DNS-7801 solutions that were stable as formulated and up on manipulation for oral administration. The solutions were compatible with apple juice, used to mask (blind) the potential taste differences between the placebo and DNS7801 solutions when dosing study subjects. The oral administration of the solutions resulted in dose proportional C-max, AUC(0-24), and AUC(0-infinity) of DNS-7801 in non-elderly and elderly subjects. A key advantage of the use of an EP approach with DNS-7801 was the flexibility in dose selection that this approach offered because DNS-7801 concentration in the preparation and/or volume could be readily adjusted based on real-time cohort data.

AB Sulindac loaded poly(HEMA) cross-linked microparticles were synthesized via one-pot free-radical dispersion polymerisation in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) in presence of photocleavable diblock stabilisers based on polyethylene oxide (PEO) and poly(heptadecafluorodecyl acrylate) (PFDA) bearing a o-nitrobenzyl photosensitive junction (hv) (PEO-hv-PFDA), and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linker. Poly (HEMA) cross-linked microparticles either empty or sulindac loaded were obtained with well-defined spherical morphology with the sizes between 250 and 350 nm. Additionally, upon UV-photolysis the stabiliser on the surface was cleaved which permits to microparticles to be redispersed in water leading to water swollen microgels about 2.1-3.6 mu m. Moreover, the release behaviour from obtained microgels indicated the sustained release of sulindac over 10 days. Besides, the surface modification after UV-photolysis was studied and proved that the particles can be functionalised with further chemistries.

AB The present studies were designed to evaluate inhalatory microparticles carrying indomethacin (IN) for potential local (specific and non-specific bronchial inflammatory asthma responses) and systemic treatments (joint inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis pain) by optimizing microparticle properties, characterizing their lung deposition, drug release, evaluating cytotoxicity and also pharmacological effect in vitro. The acidic groups of IN were complexed with the cationic groups of the polyelectrolyte polylysine in order to increase the drug water compatibility. The polylysine/indomethacin ratio was fixed and the pH was adjusted in different formulations. Microparticles were obtained by spray drying using a relatively high atomization air flowrate (742 L/min) and a high-performance cyclone in order to optimize the production of microparticles with adequate attributes for inhalatory delivery. The produced microparticles exhibited high process yield and IN loading, volumetric mean diameters smaller than 5 mu m and narrow particle size distributions. According to demonstrated aerosolization performance, the powders were suitable for inhalatory indomethacin local and systemic treatments. Emitted fraction was higher than 90%, the MMAD was around 3 mu m and the GSD lower than 3. The respirable fraction for particles with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 5 mu m was around 29% while for particles with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 3 mu m the value was around 17%. The addition of lactose as carrier worsened the aerodynamic performance of the microparticles. The developed powdered systems got wet and dissolved quickly and presented higher release rates respect to pure IN in simulated lung physiological conditions. Furthermore, the assays performed in RAW 264.7 cell line showed that the microparticles exhibited the same anti-inflammatory capability as the pure drug. The developed particles did not affect the RAW 264.7 cell viability. In conclusion, a promising powder formulation for DPIs has been developed to treat, locally and systemically, inflammatory diseases.

AB Linalool (C10H18O), also known as 3, 7-dimethyl-1, 6-octadien-3-ol, is the most common acyclic monoterpene tertiary alcohol present in essential oils of several aromatic plant species. Previous studies indicate that linalool is a valuable compound with a wide range of therapeutic properties. The promising therapeutic effects of linalool are however limited by its poor water solubility and volatility. Recently, the encapsulation of linalool in drug delivery systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) has demonstrated to overcome linalool physicochemical limitations The present study aimed the production and optimization of linalool encapsulation in SLN applying the experimental full factorial design. The estimation of the long-term stability of the produced linalool-loaded SLN was carried out using a new centrifugal sedimentation method, LUMiSizer (R). SLN dispersions were produced by the hot high pressure homogenization (HPH) method. The influence of the independent variables, surfactant and lipid concentrations on linalool-loaded SLN particle size, polydispersity index (PI) and zeta potential (ZP) was evaluated by a 2(2) factorial design composed of 2 variables which were set at 2-levels each. For each of the three dependent variables, analysis of the variance (ANOVA) was performed using a 95% confidence interval. The concentration of surfactant, as well as, the interaction between the different concentrations of lipid and surfactant, hada statistically significant effect on the particle size and PI. Experimental factorial design has been successfully employed to develop an optimal SLN dispersion, requiring a minimum of performed experiments. Based on the obtained results, the optimal linalool-loaded SLN dispersion was composed of 1% (w/v) linalool 2% (w/v) of solid lipid and 5% (w/v) of surfactant. Furthermore, the stability analysis revealed that the produced linalool-loaded SLN dispersions have limited storage stability which can be easily overcome through the assembly of a polymeric coating on the SLN surface. LUMiSizer (R) has been successfully used in the kinetic analysis of linalool-SLN during accelerated storage time.

AB The comilling process plays an important role in solid oral dosage manufacturing. In this process, the granulated products are comminuted to the required size distribution through collisions created from a rotating impeller. In addition to predicting particle size distribution, there is a need to predict other critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as bulk density and tapped density, as these impact tablet compaction behavior. A comprehensive modeling approach to predict the CQAs is needed to aid continuous process modeling in order to simulate interaction with the tablet press operation. In the current work, a full factorial experiment design is implemented to understand the influence of granule strength, impeller speed and residual moisture content on the CQAs. A population balance modeling approach is applied to predict milled particle size distribution and a partial least squares modeling approach is used to predict bulk and tapped density of the milled granule product. Good agreement between predicted and experimental CQAs is achieved. An R-2 value of 0.9787 and 0.7633 is obtained when fitting the mean particle diameters of the milled product and the time required to mill the granulated material respectively.

AB Three-dimensional printing (3DP) has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, enabling personalised medicines to be produced on-demand. To facilitate integration into healthcare, non-destructive characterisation techniques are required to ensure final product quality. Here, the use of process analytical technologies (PAT), including near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and Raman confocal microscopy, were evaluated on paracetamol-loaded 3D printed cylindrical tablets composed of an acrylic polymer (Eudragit L10055). Using a portable NIR spectrometer, a calibration model was developed, which predicted successfully drug concentration across the range of 4-40% w/w. The model demonstrated excellent linearly (R-2 = 0.996) and accuracy (RMSEP = 0.63%) and results were confirmed with conventional HPLC analysis. The model maintained high accuracy for tablets of a different geometry (torus shapes), a different formulation type (oral films) and when the polymer was changed from acrylic to cellulosic (hypromellose, HPMC). Raman confocal microscopy showed a homogenous drug distribution, with paracetamol predominantly present in the amorphous form as a solid dispersion. Overall, this article is the first to report the use of a rapid 'point-and-shoot' approach as a non-destructive quality control method, supporting the integration of 3DP for medicine production into clinical practice.

AB Fluidized beds are used by pharmaceutical manufacturers for multi-particulate drug coating. They provide effective mass and heat transfer; however, unit optimization can be difficult due to the multivariate nature of a fluidized bed system. This research explores the use of passive acoustic emissions monitoring as a method to improve temperature management during pellet coating. A piezoelectric microphone was placed inside the exhaust of a conical top spray fluidized bed. Spherical 1000 mu m pellets were coated while recording acoustic emissions. Fluidization air temperature was adjusted between trials as a controlled variable to determine if pellet drying rate could be extracted from the data. During each trial, pellets became damp as the coating solution was applied. Drying stages were used to remove moisture whereby pellet fluidization continued without spraying. The moving standard deviation of the acoustic emissions increased by approximately 40 mV during each 2-min coating stage. The emissions then decreased during drying. This decrease was at a rate proportional to pellet drying independently measured at each controlled temperature. The overall coating-drying emissions profile was similar for trials using either sugar or Acryl-EZE (R) coating solutions. Passive acoustic emissions monitoring is non-invasive and provides reliable coating and drying information during fluidized bed operation.

AB This study investigates the formulation of surfactant-free Pickering nano-emulsions able to release a drug at specific pH, in order to enhance its oral bioavailability. The stabilizing nanoparticles composed of magnesium hydroxide, were obtained by nano-precipitation method. The oil-in-water Pickering nano-emulsions stabilized with Mg(OH)(2) nanoparticles, and encapsulating a model of hydrophobic drug (ibuprofen) were formulated following a high-energy process, using a sonication probe. The experimental approach explored the impact of all formulation parameters, composition and size of Mg(OH)(2) nanoparticles, on the physico-chemical properties of the Pickering nano-emulsions. The system was characterized by DLS and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, Mg(OH)(2) has the advantage of being solubilized in an acid medium leading to the destabilization of the nano-emulsion and the release of the active ingredient orally. The acid release study (pH = 1.2) showed cumulative release as a function of initial nanodroplet loading and saturation concentration. In basic media (pH = 6.8), we found a significant release of ibuprofen from the nano-emulsions that already had saturation in an acid medium. These nano-emulsions can not only protect patients from the side effects of acid medicines through the basic properties of hydroxides but also can contribute to the increase of the bioavailability of these drugs. In addition, once in the stomach pH is increased by hydroxides and promotes the release of active ingredients such as ibuprofen whose solubility is strongly influenced by pH.

AB For many years, administration of drugs by inhalation has been the mainstay treatment for obstructive respiratory disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Antibiotics and other drugs have been administered for decades as aerosols to treat other pulmonary disease in a clinical setting, but it was until the early 1980's that colistin was formally marketed as a solution for nebulization in Europe (Colomycin, Pharmax, Bexley). The solubility of other drugs and the size of the dose required to achieve therapeutic concentrations at the site of action, made treatment times long and difficult to be performed at home. High dose dry powder delivery is a potentially effective way to deliver low potency drugs such as antibiotics. There are three major barriers to achieving the desired pharmacodynamic effect with these compounds: aerosol delivery, lung deposition and clearance. The powder formulation and device technology influence aerosol generation and may influence the size of the dose that can be achieved by inhalation in one puff. The site of deposition in the lungs is dictated by mechanisms of deposition which are influenced by the aerosol properties, particularly aerodynamic particle size distribution and the anatomy and physiology of the lungs. Finally, mechanisms of clearance dictate the local and systemic disposition of the drug, which in turn affects its pharmacokinetics and ultimately the pharmacodynamic effect and efficacy of treatment. Each of these factors will be considered and the implications for antimicrobial agent delivery as a high dose delivery example will be given.

AB The purpose of the study was to develop a redispersible dry emulsion, containing a lipophilic, poorly water soluble model drug simvastatin, by employing fluid bed coating technology. The presented dry emulsion manufacturing approach produces pellets in a way, where a layer of the dry emulsion is applied to a neutral core. In the preliminary formulation development phase 1-oleoyl-rac-glycerol was chosen as the oily lipid phase, based on the high drug solubility and potential bioavailability enhancement capability. Mannitol, HPMC and Tween 20 were selected as the solid carriers and surfactant, respectively. The design of experiments, specifically the mixture design approach, was used to obtain the optimal formulation composition. The emulsion reconstitution ability and stability were the main responses, used as the decisive parameters for formulation optimisation. Optimised formulations showed narrow droplet size distribution upon reconstitution, high stability, suitable drug loading and enhanced dissolution profile, compared to a non-lipid based tablet and the pure drug. The scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and image analysis disclosed a uniform morphology of the applied layer with separated droplets with simvastatin and uniform size distribution and a circular shape of coated pellets. The study represents the proof of concept of designing redispersible dry emulsions using a fluid bed layering approach.

AB Camptothecin (CPT) is an important topoisomerase I enzyme (Topo I) targeting anti-cancer drug, but its oral administration is limited by poor bioavailability and severe side effects. In this study, a redox sensitive CPT prodrug loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) system for oral delivery was developed. First of all, CPT-palmitic acid conjugate via a cleavable disulfide bond linker (CPT-SS-PA) was synthesized and encapsulated into SLN. The drug release of SLN was evaluated in neutral environment, simulated gastrointestinal fluid and reductive solution. The results indicated that CPT-SS-PA SLN maintained chemical structural stability in simulated physiological environment but exhibited quick reduction-response release of CPT in the presence of dithiothreitol. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity of CPT-SS-PA SLN was tested against cancer cell lines, and the cellular uptake behavior for oral delivery was checked by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) using Caco-2 cells model. From the data, CPT-SS-PA SLN revealed high anti-cancer activity and enhanced Caco-2 cell absorption. Finally, the oral bioavailability and intestinal safety of CPT-SS-PA SLN were preliminary evaluated by in vivo pharmacokinetic and histopathological study, respectively. This study demonstrated that CPT-SS-PA SLN could be developed as an effective CPT oral delivery system due to its enhanced oral bioavailability and reduced intestinal side effect.

AB CKD-519, a potent cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, is a clinical candidate being developed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. It is considered a Biopharmaceutical Classification System II compound with low solubility and high permeability. The objective of this study was to develop early formulations focusing on the dissolution rate of the compound to achieve dose-dependent exposure. High performance formulation strategies including solid dispersion (SD) and a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) were investigated and their in vivo and in vitro correlations were also evaluated in monkeys along with dose optimization in human volunteers. The SD granules were prepared in a fluid bed granulator using microcrystalline cellulose and mannitol as carriers. Poloxamer 407 and Eudragit E PO were each found to be a suitable solubilizing agent and polymer for the improvement of the CKD-519 dissolution rate. Pharmacokinetic studies in monkeys showed that the SD tablets exhibited better absorption than the SMEDDS in a dose-dependent manner from 1.5 mg to 100 mg. The mannitol-based SD tablet formulations were bioequivalent. However, pharmacokinetics studies in humans showed that the dose was saturable above 100 mg of CKD-519. This study was performed to determine how to develop early formulations for clinical studies and to identify rational formulation development strategies for CKD-519 to establish the pharmaceutical proof-of-concept in humans.

AB This study reports on the immunogenicity assessment of a novel chimeric peptide vaccine including Tax, gp21, gp46, and gag immunodominant epitopes of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) to induce immunity against HTLV-1 after subcutaneous (SC) or intranasal administration in a mice model. Additionally, to elevate the efficacy of the HTLV-1 vaccine, the chimera was physically mixed with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) or ISCOMATRIX (IMX) adjuvants. For this purpose, the ISCOMATRIX with a size range of 40-60 nm were prepared using lipid film hydration method. Our investigation revealed that the mixture of IMX and chimera could significantly increase antibody titers containing IgG2a, and mucosal IgA, as well as IFN-gamma and IL-10 cytokines and decrease the level of TGF-beta 1, compared to other vaccine formulations. The intranasal delivery of chimera vaccine in the absence or presence adjuvants stimulated potent mucosal sIgA titer relative to subcutaneous immunization. Furthermore, the SC or nasal delivery of various vaccine formulations could shift the immunity toward cell-mediated responses, as evident by higher IgG2a and IFN-gamma, as well as suppressed TGF-beta 1 level. Our findings suggest that proper design, construction, and immunization of multi-epitope vaccine are essential for developing an effective HTLV-1 vaccine.

AB A promising strategy to design safer and more effective cationic lipids for gene delivery with inherent antibacterial properties is to covalently tether a lipophilic moiety with oligomeric aminoglycosides (AGs), a large family of Gram-negative-active antibiotics. Herein, we reported the development of a new class of multicationichead AG-based amphiphiles built on the tetramino-tetrahexyloxycalixPlarene (4A4Hex-calix-calix[4]) scaffold. Three different conjugates, namely 4A4Hex-calix-calix[4]-neomycin, -neamine, and -paromomycin, were synthesized and characterized. Due to the inherent multivalency of AGs and the amphiphilic behaviour, every 4A4Hex-calix-calix[4]-AG exhibited greater DNA binding ability than the gold standard transfectant 25 kDa bPEI and striking DNA packing ability. DNA/4A4Hex-calix-calix[4]-AG complexes at charge ratios (CRs, +/-) used for transfections displayed good colloidal stability, with a hydrodynamic diameters of approximate to 150 nm and an overall surface charges of approximate to+ 30 mV. DNA/4A4Hex-calix[4]-AGs nanoassemblies, everyone tested at the optimal CR, invariably showed good transfection efficiency in two cell lines, along with low-to-negligible cytotoxicity. Besides, DNA/4A4Hex-calix-calix[4]-AG complexes exhibited appreciable antimicrobial activity against Gramnegative bacteria, even greater than uncomplexed 4A4Hex-calix-calix[4]-AGs. Altogether, these results disclose 4A4Hex-calix[4]-AGs as promising gene delivery tools with unique antibacterial properties.

AB Increasing numbers of elderly people require mull-drug therapies. One route to improve adherence rates is to prepare fixed dose combinations (FDCs), in which multiple active ingredients are loaded into a single formulation. Here, we report the use of electrospinning to prepare fast-dissolving oral FDCs containing amlodipine besylate and valsartan, two drugs prescribed as FDCs for the treatment of hypertension. Electrospun fibers were prepared loaded with one or both drugs, using polyvinylpyrrolidone as the polymer matrix. The fibers were largely cylindrical in morphology and comprise amorphous solid dispersions except with the highest loadings of amlodipine besylate. HPLC demonstrated drug entrapment efficiencies of > 85% of the theoretical dose. The mats have folding endurances and thicknesses suitable for use as oral films. The amlodipine besylate-loaded systems are fast-dissolving, with > 90% release obtained within 120 s. In contrast, valsartan release from its single-drug formulations took longer, ranging from 360 s to 24 min. With the FDC formulations, rapid release within 360 s was achieved when the loading was 5% w/w of each drug, but again the release time increased with drug loading. Electrospun fibers therefore have significant promise as FDCs, but the target drug and its loading need to be carefully considered.

AB To evaluate the potency of hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols (PVAs) as matrices for solid dispersion (SD) formulations, we examined their inhibitory effects on precipitation of a poorly water-soluble drug, indomethacin (IND). Additionally, to clarify their mechanism, we investigated the intermolecular interaction of IND with PVAs in the supersaturated aqueous solution of IND. In the present study, we used five kinds of PVAs, i.e. JR-05 (70.0-74.0% hydrolyzed), JL-05E (80.0-84.0% hydrolyzed), JP-05 (87.0-89.0% hydrolyzed), JT-05 (93.5-94.5% hydrolyzed) and JF-05 (98.0-99.0% hydrolyzed). Of various PVAs, the lowly hydrolyzed PVAs such as JR-05 and JL-05E dramatically inhibited the precipitate formation of IND. Interestingly, the lowly hydrolyzed PVAs possessed micelle-forming ability, and inhibited the nucleation and crystal growth of IND. Moreover, strong hydrophobic interactions between vinyl acetate unit of lowly hydrolyzed PVA and hydrophobic moiety of IND were suggested based on the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) in deuterium oxide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the inhibitory effects of the hydrolyzed degree of PVAs on the precipitation of a drug, and demonstrating the intermolecular interaction between PVAs and a drug using NOESY in water.

AB Cystinosis is a genetic disorder that leads to the formation of cystine crystals in many organs in the body including cornea. Ocular manifestation of this disease is treated by eye drops of cysteamine which can easily oxidize into its disulfide cystamine. The rapid oxidation limits the shelf life as well the duration during which the drug can be used after opening the eye drop bottle. We evaluate two approaches of preventing the oxidation of cysteamine with the goal of increasing the time of use after opening the bottle to one month. The first approach integrates antioxidants such as catalase enzyme and vitamins C and E into the aqueous solution. Results show that catalase is the most effective additive as it decreases the oxidation rate by 58%, which on its own is not sufficient to reach targeted one month stability. The second approach focuses on incorporating diffusion barriers to prevent oxygen from reaching the cysteamine solution. This was accomplished by two methods: formulation of a hydrophobic layer which floats on the surface of the aqueous solution and integration of OMAC (R) oxygen-resistant material into the eye drop bottle. Both methods delay the onset of cysteamine degradation and decrease the rate of degradation. In particular, an eye drop bottle with three layers of OMAC (R) has less than 10% degradation after one month of opening the bottle and withdrawing a drop each day. By integrating all three methods, we designed a system where > 90% of cysteamine remains in the active form for 70 days after opening the bottle. In addition, we examine the use of OMAC (R) as heat-sealed pouches for storage of cysteamine eye drop bottles during packaging to eliminate the need for the current approach of freezing the formulation during shipping. The results show that such heat-sealed pouches would keep cysteamine stable for over one year at ambient conditions.

AB The goose liver is an ideal model for deciphering lipogenesis molecular mechanisms. This study was designed to investigate the effect of different lipid sources on hepatic lipogenesis in overfed geese. Sixty Landes geese were fed ad libitum with no fat (control) or overfed diets containing 2% goose fat (GF) or rapeseed oil (RO) for 20 days. We measured fatty acid composition of the liver at day 20 of overfeeding. We performed a transcriptomic comparison of fatty liver between GF and RO-fed geese to gain insights into the molecular and cellular events mediating lipogenesis activity. The results showed that there was no substantial effect on fatty liver performance between GF- and RO-fed geese. Significant differences in fatty acid composition were detected between GF- and RO-fed geese. Total omega - 6 PUFAs increased and saturated fatty acid decreased (P < 0.05) with RO supplementation when compared with GF, but omega - 3 PUFAs did not differ between the two diets. Concentrations of C16:1, C18:1, C18:2, C20:2, and C22:1 were higher (P < 0.05) in the fatty liver of RO-fed geese compared to those in the GF group. Analysis of transcriptome sequencing showed that there were 124 up regulated and 129 down-regulated differentially expressed genes in the fatty liver of RO and GF-fed geese. Many of these genes code for proteins involved in the lipid metabolic process, including bile secretion, adipocytokine signalling pathway, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid metabolism, fatty acid elongation and fatty acid biosynthesis, and fat digestion and absorption. Moreover, genes involved in lipid-related pathways such as peroxisome, steroid biosynthesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and apoptosis were altered, suggesting that the fatty liver of goose fed different oils undertakes both an oxidation function and hormone-related metabolic function.
   In conclusions, these data suggest that RO supplementation reduces liver lipid oxidation and improves lipogenesis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in fatty liver formation and provide valuable resources for analysing mechanisms underlying the effects of oils from different sources on the goose fatty liver.

AB Previous studies have shown that high levels of PLK1 are expressed in HCC, and PLK1 inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials. However, the mechanisms, which regulate PLK1 expression in HCC, have not been clarified. Here, we show that induction of let-7b over-expression inhibits the PLK1-regulated luciferase activity in HEK-293T cells, and decreases the levels of PLK1 expression in HCC cells. Furthermore, the levels of let-7b expression were negatively correlated with PLK1 expression in HCC tissues. Let-7b over-expression inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells and promoted their apoptosis, which were partially rescued by increased PLK1 expression. Let-7b over-expression decreased the levels of PLK1, CDC25C and Survivin phosphorylation and CDC2, beta-catenin, TCF-4 expression, which were mitigated by increased PLK1 expression in MHCC-97H cells. Let-7b over expression inhibited the development and growth of implanted HCC tumors in mice by decreasing PLK1 and Survivin expression in the tumors. Together, our data indicated that let-7b targeted PLK1 to inhibit HCC growth and induce their apoptosis by attenuating the PLK1-mediated Survivin phosphorylation. Our findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HCC.

AB Tudor domain containing protein 1 (tdrd1) is a member of the Tudor family and has shown essential functions during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. In this study, we cloned the full length cDNA of Paralichthys olivaceus tdrd1 (Potdrd1). PoTDRD1 is a multidomain protein with an N-terminal MYND zinc finger domain, followed by four tandem extended Tudor domains. Sequence comparison, genomic structure, phylogenetic analyses and synteny analyses showed that Potdrd1 was homologous to those of other teleosts. In adult individuals, the expression of Potdrd1 was higher in testis than in ovary, demonstrating a sexually dimorphic gene expression pattern. In situ hybridization (ISH) showed that Potdrd1 mRNA was detected in oogonia and oocytes of ovary as well as in spermatogonia and spermatocytes of testis. In juveniles during gonad differentiation its expression level increased rapidly from 30 dph to 100 dph and showed obvious sexual dimorphism that was in accordance with the expression of anti-Mullerian hormone (omit). Potdrd1 mRNA was consistently detected during embryogenesis, and its level was higher from unfertilzed eggs to the blastula stage and subsequently decreased until hatching. When chimeric RNA containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of Potdrd1 was microinjected into zebrafish fertilized eggs, the green fluorescence could be visualized only in putative PGCs. These results indicated that Potdrd1 is a germline specific and sexually dimorphic factor that potentially functionate in germline development and gametogenesis in Japanese flounder.

AB Cell death is a normal phenomenon in the course of biological development, moreover, which is also a prominent feature in lung exposed to hyperoxia. Severe hypoxia occurs in ALI/ARDS patients, who generally require high concentration oxygen therapy assisted by mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, high oxygen can cause excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to apoptosis in lung epithelial cells, which has been reported in our previous study. Herein, the correlation between increments of ROS and CCN6 expression was negative in CCN6-mediated the mitochondria dependent, intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our latest research explained that CCN6 can inhibit caspase-8 mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway to protect cells from hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. As demonstrated by Western Blot Analysis, Caspase 8 cleavage and Caspase 3 cleavage in CCN6-depleted cells exceeded the control group treated with high oxygen (48 h). And deletion of CCN6 enhanced caspase-8 activation after hyperoxia shown by Flow Cytometry. Although, it is unclear how CCN6 participated in the regulation of apoptotic pathways, the future targeted therapy drugs inhibiting CCN6 may be useful in the treatment of ALI/ARDS.

AB Purpose: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play important roles in tumorigenesis. The variant in MMP-9 -1562 C/T (single nucleotide polymorphisms labeled rs3918242) has been extensively evaluated as predisposing factors to digestive cancers susceptibility. However, most of these studies only contained a small number of subjects and they showed conflicting results. Therefore, to elucidate these associations, we carried out a large-scale meta-analysis to provide this accurately comprehensive synopsis of case-control studies.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in EMBASE, OVID, Medline, China National Knowledge Internet and Wanfang for relevant data published between Jan 2000 and Mar 2018. Overall and stratified analyses based on the cancer types, ethnicity and source of control were carried out. Odds ratios (ORs) correspondent to 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to evaluate the genetic correlation between the variant and digestive cancer susceptibility. Review Manager 5.2 and Stata 12.0 were used for statistical analysis.
   Results: Twenty studies containing 3201 digestive cancer patients and 4301 matched-controls were screened out. The overall results suggested that MMP-9-1562 C/T polymorphism increased the susceptibility to digestive cancers under homozygote and recessive models (homozygote, OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.00-1.82, P = 0.05; recessive, OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.07-1.88, P = 0.02). Furthermore, in the subgroup analysis based on the source of control, similar conclusions were obtained in the population-based control subgroup (homozygote, OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.16-2.27, P = 0.004; recessive, OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.22-2.28, P = 0.001), but not in the hospital-based control. In subgroup analyses based on cancer types and ethnicity, no association was observed.
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggested that MMP-9 - 1562 C/T polymorphism might be related to the digestive cancer susceptibility. Evidence with adequate sample size is needed.

AB The rapid development of CRISPR technology is revolutionizing molecular approaches to the dissection of complex biological phenomena. Here we describe an alternative generally applicable implementation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system that allows for selective knockdown of extremely homologous genes. This strategy employs the lentiviral delivery of paired sgRNAs and nickase Cas9 (Cas9D10A) to achieve targeted deletion of splice junctions. This general strategy offers several advantages over standard single-guide exon-targeting CRISPR-Cas9 such as greatly reduced off-target effects, more restricted genomic editing, routine disruption of target gene mRNA expression and the ability to differentiate between closely related genes. Here we demonstrate the utility of this strategy by achieving selective knockdown of the highly homologous human genes FOXO3A and suspected pseudogene FOXO3B. We find the spJCRISPR strategy to efficiently and selectively disrupt FOXO3A and FOXO3B mRNA and protein expression; thus revealing that the human FOXO3B locus encodes a bona fide human gene. Unlike FOXO3A, we find the FOXO3B protein to be cytosolically localized in both the presence and absence of active Akt. The ability to selectively target and efficiently disrupt the expression of the closely-related FOXO3A and FOXO3B genes demonstrates the efficacy of the spJCRISPR approach.

AB Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women worldwide. Breast tumors mostly exhibit aberrant gene expression and DNA hypermethylation patterns that predispose the disease. Understanding the genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to breast cancer development is important to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers. SCARA5: Scavenger receptor class A, member 5; is a member of the scavenger receptor family located on chromosome 8p21 which is a frequently deleted region in human cancers. SCARA5 has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in various kinds of cancer. However, its role in breast cancer remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study SCARA5 expression levels in breast tumors and matched noncancerous tissue samples from 77 patients were analyzed by qRT-PCR and the expression levels were correlated with the methylation level of SCARA5 gene promoter. We found that SCARA5 expression was significantly decreased in tumors (92.2%) compared to non-cancerous tissue samples and this down-regulation was associated with hypermethylation of the promoter (p < 0.001). A significant correlation was also detected between SCARA5 expression and the histological grade of the breast tumors (p = 0.017). Taken together, our results indicate that SCARA5 may play an important role in tumorigenesis of breast cancer via promoter methylation.

AB Objective: To investigate cancer association in the genome and the genetic risk of death from major cancers according to the theory of programmed onset for an individual.
   Methods: Alleles of 15 randomly selected short tandem repeat (STR) loci, including D6S1043, D12S391, CSF1PO, D7S820, D2S1338, D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, D16S539 and D19S433, were determined in 50 patients with lung cancer and 50 patients with liver cancer. The onset age of patients with and without the alleles was compared with Cox regression. Frequencies of significant alleles from Cox regression between the cancer group and control population were analysed through logistic regression for cross-validation. The death probability in an individual carrying two or one of two cancer-related alleles or not carrying two cancer-related alleles was calculated with outcomes of case-control studies translated into the results of the cohort studies.
   Results: It was confirmed that D18S51-20 was a lung cancer-related allele and that D21S11-30.2 and D6S1043-18 were liver cancer-related alleles. Probabilities of death from lung or liver cancers ranged from 0.115 to 0.395, respectively, for those who carry and/or do not carry D18S51-20, D21S11-30.2, D6S1043-18.
   Conclusions: A more efficient method could be devised for genetic risk analysis according to the theory of programmed onset. The analysis of the CODIS-STR loci (STR loci listed in the US combined DNA indexing system) as genetic markers may provide an efficient and reliable approach to estimate an individual's genetic predisposition.

AB The common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster is an outstanding model to analyze the regulation of conserved signaling pathways. In this study, we examined whether signaling components in the Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) branch of the TGF-beta signaling pathway are involved in the response to wounding caused by either sterile injury or infection by parasitic nematodes in D. melanogaster adult flies. We found that following sterile injury, the BMP pathway Type I receptor sax and intracellular transcription factor Mad were substantially upregulated. Also, inactivation of Mad or dpp promoted fly survival and increased antimicrobial peptide gene transcript levels upon sterile injury or H. bacteriophora nematode infection, respectively, but not against the bacterial pathogen Photorhabdus luminescens. Our findings indicate the roles of certain BMP signaling components in the regulation of the fly immune response against sterile injury or nematode infection. In conclusion, this study highlights the ability of D. melanogaster to activate the BMP branch of TGF-beta signaling in order to modulate the response to injury in the absence or presence of pathogenic infection.

AB Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which belong to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, have been implicated in various biological and physiological processes, especially in the gonad development. However, scarce studies were focused on the roles of BMPs in the reproductive system of crustaceans. In this study, the whole gene encoding BMP7 protein was cloned and characterized firstly in Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. The bioinformatics analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that Es-BMP7 was composed of prodomain/latency-associated peptide and the TGF-beta characteristic domain. The sequence conservation and phylogenetic analysis were also conducted. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted indifferent tissues. The highest expression in testis indicated the potential role of BMP7 to male gonad development. Western blot results showed the different translational levels of BMP7 in different tissues. In-situ hybridization revealed that the expression of es-bmp7 signals presented in a bimodal manner: highest in spermatogonia, decreased in spermatocytes and stage I spermatids, disappeared in stage II spermatids, and showed up again in stage III spermatids and mature sperm. To further verify the potential roles during spermatogenesis, immunofluorescence was conducted and results showed the similar expression tendency with in situ hybridization. The protein signal was highest in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia, continued to decline in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and the following stages, and weak signal was found in the mature sperm. Taken together, our results revealed that Es-BMP7 might play a part in testis development in Eriocheir sinensis, presumably by maintaining the self-renewal of spermatogonia and promoting the germ cell differentiation/meiotic mitosis, or facilitating the successful fertilization.

AB Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure, and heart transplantation globally. There is enlargement of left ventricle of the heart impairing the systolic function in this disorder. The involvement of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of DCM has been reported in up to 50% of the cases. However, due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease, the complete pathophysiology remains unclear. In this study, whole exomes of five unrelated patients of idiopathic DCM were sequenced to an average depth of 100 x using Illumina HiSeq4000 system. The analysis of the data with in silico tools SIFT, Polyphen2, and CADD showed 494 rare (AF < 1.0%) missense SNVs predicted as deleterious. Detrimental variants in genes highly expressed in cardiac tissue included 3 rare allele frequency loss-of-function SNVs in C2orf40, MYOM3, and TMED4 genes, a homozygous frameshift insertion in RTKN2, and a splice site homozygous deletion in SLC6A6 in at least one of the patients. The stop-gained SNV rs143187236 of MYOM3 (myomesin 3) was found in perfect linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 1.0) with its neighboring missense SNV rs149105212 in two of the patients, representing the role of myomesin 3 in pathophysiology of DCM. Allele frequency comparison showed three variants rs375563861 (C2orf40), rs143187236 (MYOM3), and rs564181443 (RTKN2) having 3 fold or higher allele frequency in South Asians than in the global populations. The identified pathogenic variants can be used in risk assessment and precision therapy in DCM patients.

AB Endometriosis is a common gynecological condition with unclear pathogenesis. Although a dysregulated IncRNA expression profile has been speculated, very few studies have addressed this hypothesis. We determined the differential IncRNA and mRNA expression patterns between endometriosis and control tissues, and between eutopic and normal endometrium in the proliferative phase, using RNA sequencing. The potential targets of IncRNA were predicted on the basis of cis and trans action, and lncRNAs were functionally annotated in relation to their co-expressed mRNAs. Dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs were screened relative to the biological features of endometriosis, and the five filtered lncRNAs were validated using qRT-PCR. A total of 9924 novel IncRNA transcripts were identified, and 86 lncRNAs and 1228 mRNAs were differentially expressed between the endometriosis and control groups. GO and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in the biological processes and signaling pathways involved in endometriosis. A co-dingnoncoding gene (CNC) co-expression network was constructed using the dysregulated lncRNAs and their co-expressed mRNAs to simulate the complex intergenic interactions. This study is the first to use sequencing technology to elucidate the differentially IncRNA expression profiles of eutopic and normal endometrium in the proliferative phase of endometriosis. The dysregulated IncRNAs can potentially be novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of endometriosis.

AB Background: Recent studies have shown that the long non-coding RNA urothelial carcinoma-associated (UCA1) plays a key role in cardiovascular injury. However, the potential biological role of UCA1 in progression of atherosclerosis (AS) remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to identify the regulation of lncRNA UCA1 on atherosclerosis-related vascular dysfunction via miR-26a targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and investigate the underlying mechanisms in the development of atherosclerosis.
   Methods: The proliferation and migration were detected using CCK-8 assay, Wound healing assay and Transwell assay. The expression of miR-26a and its target gene in vascular smooth muscle cells was detected by qRT-PCR, the complementary binging of miRNA and lncRNA was verified by luciferase assays. PTEN was predicted to be the target of miR-26a and the prediction was verified by luciferase assays.
   Results: Expression of miR-26a was up-regulated in ox-LDL (50 mg/l) induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMCs), and overexpression of miR-26a inhibited PTEN expression and promoted PCNA alpha-SMA and SM22-alpha expression (qRT-PCR and WB).
   Conclusion: The expression of UCA1 antagonized the effect of miR-26a on the downregulation of its target PETN and contraction phenotype. This study reveals that lncRNA UCA1 act as an endogenous sponge of miR-26a and downregulates miR-26a expression levels, and thereby relieving the inhibition of its target gene PTEN and alleviates VSMCs proliferation against atherosclerosis.

AB Background: The roles of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene polymorphisms in atherosclerotic diseases were intensively analyzed, but the results of these studies were inconsistent. Therefore, we performed this study to better assess the relationship between PAI-1 genetic variations and atherosclerosis.
   Methods: Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Medline, Embase and Web of Science. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (Cis) were used to assess relationship between PAI-1 polymorphisms and atherosclerotic diseases.
   Results: Ninety-nine studies involving 62,739 cases and 87,169 controls were finally included. Significant associations with the risk of atherosclerosis were detected for the rs2227631 polymorphism in the dominant model (95% CI 0.84-1.00), for the rs1799889 polymorphism in the dominant (95% CI 1.01-1.18), recessive (95% CI 0.90-0.98) and allele (95% CI 1.01-1.12) models. Further subgroup analyses based on type of disease and ethnicity of participants suggested that the rs2227631 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of coronary artery disease in the dominant (95% CI 0.71-0.94) and allele (95% CI 0.80-0.94) models, whereas the rs1799889 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of myocardial infarction (dominant model: 95% CI 1.09-1.57; recessive model: 95% CI 0.71-0.96; allele model: 95% CI 1.05-1.28) and cerebral infarction (dominant model: 95% CI 1.68-3.51; additive model: 95% CI 0.39-0.77; allele model: 95% CI 1.23-2.00). Moreover, the rs1799889 polymorphism was also significantly correlated with the risk of atherosclerosis in both Asians (dominant model: 95% CI 1.10-1.83; allele model: 95% CI 1.03-1.41) and Caucasians (recessive model: 95% CI 0.87-0.97; allele model: 95% CI 1.01-1.12).
   Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings indicate that PAI-1 rs2227631 and rsl 799889 polymorphisms may serve as genetic biomarkers of atherosclerotic diseases.

AB Currently, genetic risk score (GRS) model has been a widely used method to evaluate the genetic effect of cancer risk prediction, but seldom studies investigated their discriminatory power, especially for colorectal cancer (CRC) risk prediction. In this study, we applied both simulation and real data to comprehensively compare the discriminability of different GRS models. The GRS models were fitted by logistic regression with three scenarios, including simple count GRS (SC-GRS), logistic regression weighted GRS (LR-GRS, including DL-GRS and OR-GRS) and explained variance weighted GRS (EV-GRS, including EV_DL-GRS and EV_OR-GRS) models. The model performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under curves (AUC) metric, net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). In real data analysis, as DL-GRS and EV_DL-GRS models were carried with serious over-fitting, the other three models were kept for further comparison. Compared to unweighted SC-GRS model, reclassification was significantly decreased in OR-GRS model (NRI = -0.082, IDI = 0.002, P < 0.05), while EV_OR-GRS model showed negative NRI and IDI (NRI = 0.077, IDI = 5.54E 04, P < 0.05) compared to OR-GRS model. Besides, traditional model with smoking status (AUC = 0.523) performed lower discriminability compared to the combined model (AUC = 0.607) including genetic (i.e., SC-GRS) and smoking factors. Similarly, the findings from simulation were all consistent to real data results. It is plausible that SC-GRS model could be optimal for predicting genetic risk of CRC. Moreover, the addition of more significant genetic variants to traditional model could further improve predictive power on CRC risk prediction.

AB The differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients may act as a diagnostic biomarker. A four-stage study was performed to identify plasma miRNAs with potential in detecting PC. Exiqon panels (20 PC vs. 10 normal controls (NCs)) were applied in the screening phase to obtain miRNA profiling. The identified miRNAs were further assessed in the training (40 PC vs. 40 NCs) and testing stages (112 PC vs. 116 NCs) with qRT-PCR assays. A six-miRNA signature including up-regulated miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-193b-3p, miR-221-3p and miR-27b-3p was identified. The signature could accurately discriminate PC patients from NCs with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.848, 0.833 and 0.937 for the training, testing and the external validation stage (41 PC vs. 50 NCs), respectively. The multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that down-regulated plasma miR-125b-5p could predict worse OS independent from late tumor stage and high CA19-9. All the six miRNAs except miR-122-5p showed high expression levels in PC tissues than those in matched normal tissues. MiR-122-5p and miR-193b-3p were up-regulated, while miR-221-3p was down-regulated in plasma exosomes from PC patients. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that the miRNAs might involve in several molecular pathways closely related with PC such as p53 signaling pathway, pancreatic cancer, TGF-beta signaling pathway and so on. In conclusion, we identified a six-miRNA signature in plasma which could act as a non-invasive biomarker in diagnosis and prognosis of PC. Plasma miR-125b-5p might act as an independent biomarker in predicting OS of PC patients.

AB Aims/introduction: Streptozotocin (STZ) is a permanent diabetogenic compound and often used in animal diabetes modeling. The aim of this study is to compare the liver transcriptome of type 2 diabetes models (T2DM) in Guangxi Bama Mini-pig (GBM pig) induced by STZ or Non-STZ.
   Research design and methods: 22 female GBM pigs were divided into 4 groups. Ctr group (4 pigs): standard diets; DM1_HH group (10 pigs): high fat and high carbohydrate diets; DM2_HS group (4 pigs): high fat and high carbohydrate diets + STZ; DM3_SH group (4 pigs): STZ + high fat and high carbohydrate diets. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) were measured monthly. Glucose disappearance rate was evaluated by intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Three pigs liver samples as biological replicates in each group were used for transcriptome sequencing analysis.
   Results: All pigs injected with STZ were identified as diabetic. But only 4 of 10 pigs in DM1_HH group met the diabetes model standard. The most severe insulin resistance was observed in DM2_HS group. The FBG of DM1_HH, DM2_HS, DM3_SH and Ctr group were 7.20 +/- 0.17, 14.13 +/- 0.45, 7.98 +/- 0.99 and 4.43 +/- 0.27 mmol/L, respectively; the FINS were 53.67 +/- 1.82, 33.38 +/- 2.32, 49.91 +/- 1.50 and 39.78 +/- 1.14 mU/L, respectively. Compared with DM1_HH group, liver transcriptome showed that 7 genes were up-regulated while 10 were down-regulated in DM2_HS, 16 genes were up-regulated while 14 were down regulated in DM3_SH. There were 4 co-expressive genes in DM2_HSvsDM1_HH and DM3_SHvsDM1_HH, including cystein rich 61 gene (CYR61), ribosomal protein L15 gene (RPL15), regulator of G protein signaling 1 gene (RGS1) and LOC102166695 gene.
   Conclusion: STZ can rapidly induce T2DM model in GBM pig, but STZ caused abnormal expression of genes in the liver.

AB Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have yielded a wealth of information furnishing support for the variability in genetic predisposition to disease. However, the actual impact of such findings on any particular ethnic population needs to be validated through replication studies. In the present study, we verified recent findings of a GWAS demonstrating a strong association for the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor B (CDKN2B) genomic region with coronary artery disease (CAD)/myocardial infarction (MI) in ethnic Saudi Arabs.
   Methodology: We genotyped 8 CDKN2B SNPs for cardiovascular risk in 4650 Saudi Arabs, comprising 2429 CAD cases (1860 males; 569 female) and 2221 controls (1189 male; 1032 female) by Taqman assay.
   Results: Four SNPs, rs4977574_A [0.56(0.50-0.63); p < 0.0001], rs10757274_A [0.87(0.77-0.97); p = 0.014], rs10738607_A [0.89(0.80-1.00); p = 0.043] and rs1333045_T [0.54(0.48-0.61); p < 0.0001] residing on the CDKN2B gene were significantly associated with CAD following multivariate adjustments for MI, HTN and DM, while four others were weakly associated with the disease. Likewise, three SNPs, rs1412829_G [0.84(0.72-0.97); p = 0.019], rs564398_C [0.81(0.70-0.94); p = 0.006], rs4977756_G [0.87(0.76-0.99); p = 0.036] were significantly associated with MI after multivariate adjustments for CAD, HTN and DM, while the other five displayed borderline associations.
   Conclusions: Our findings strongly support the notion of a critical role for the CDKN2B gene locus as a cardiovascular risk in ethnic Arabs. The study also demonstrates the importance of replication studies in ascertaining the role of a genomic sequence in disease.

AB Objective: Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the most common gynecologic tumors in women worldwide, with poor prognosis and low survival rate. In this study, we identified SNAP23 as a potential tumor suppressor gene in CC.
   Methods: The expression of SNAP23 in tissues and cell lines were measured by qRT-PCR, western blot and IHC. Knockdown of SNAP23 by siRNA and ectopic expression of SNAP23 by overexpression plasmid were performed to observe the biological function of SNAP23 in CC. Xenograft nude mice models were established to measure its function in vivo.
   Results: SNAP23 was downregulated in CC tissues and had a negative correlation with advanced clinical characteristics. Ectopic expression of SNAP23 suppressed malignant phonotype of CC while knockdown of SNAP23 promoted the progression of CC in vitro. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that SNAP23 exerted its tumor suppressor activity via inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest. Moreover, xenograft tumor models showed that SNAP23 suppresses tumor growth in vivo.
   Conclusions: Our results revealed that SNAP23 suppressed progression of CC and induced cell cycle G2/M arrest via upregulating p21(cip1) and downregulating CyclinB1.

AB The complete mitochondrial genome is greatly important for studies on genetic structure and phylogenetic relationship at various taxonomic levels. To obtain information about the evolutionary trends of mtDNA in the Ulvophyceae and also to gain insights into the phylogenetic relationships between ulvophytes and other chlorophytes, we determined the mtDNA sequence of Caulerpa lentillifera (sea grape) using de novo mitochondrial genome sequencing. The complete genomic DNA of C. lentillifera was circular and 209,034 bp in length, and it was the largest green-algal mitochondrial genome sequenced to date, with a low gene density of 65.2%, which is reminiscent of the "expanded" pattern of evolution exhibited by embryophyte mtDNAs. The C. lentillifera mtDNA consisted of a typical set of 17 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 20 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, three ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 42 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and 29 introns, which had homologs in green-algal mtDNAs displaying an "ancestral" or a "reduced-derived" pattem of evolution. The overall base composition of its mitochondrial genome was 24.19% for A, 24.94% for T, 25.80% for G, 25.07% for C and 50.87% for GC. The mitochondrial genome of C. lentillifera was characterized by numerous small intergenic regions and introns, which was clearly different from other green algae. With the exception of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6), ND1, ATP and three tRNA genes (tRNA-His, tRNA-Thr and tRNA-Ala), all other mitochondrial genes were encoded on the heavy strand. All of the PCGs had ATG as their start codon and employed TAA, TGA or TAG as their termination codon. To gain insights into the evolutionary trends of mtDNA in the Ulvophyceae, we inferred the complete mtDNA sequence of C. lentillifera, an ulvophyte belonging to a distinct, early-diverging lineage. Taken together, our data offered useful information for the studies on phylogenetic hypotheses and phylogenetic relationships of C. lentillifera within the Chlorophyta.

AB Background: Osteogenic differentiation plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of osteolysis, which is a complication of hip orthroplasty. The roles of lncRNA PRNCR1 in osteogenic differentiation and osteolysis were dissected in this study.
   Methods: The expression of PRNCR1, miR-211-5p and C-X-C chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) protein in wear particles and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot, separately. The osteogenic differentiation degree of MSCs was assessed by ALP activity detection and ARS staining. Binding and interaction between RNA and protein were determined with RIP and RNA pull-down assay, respectively. Interaction between miR-211-5p and CXCR4 was examined by Dual luciferase reporter assay.
   Results: PRNCR1 and CXCR4 were up-regulated in wear particles around prosthesis and in MSCs treated with PMMA, while miR-211-5p was down-regulated. Repression of PRNCR1 weakened the inhibitory effect of wear particles on osteogenic differentiation. PRNCR1 positively regulated CXCR4 through inhibiting miR-211-5p. Wear particles increased CXCR4 level through miR-211-5p to inhibit osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Wear particles down-regulated miR-211-5p level through PRNCR1 to influence osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.
   Conclusion: LncRNA PRNCR1 up-regulates CXCR4 through targeting miR-211-5p, which affects osteogenic differentiation and thus contributing to osteolysis after hip replacement.

AB Background and objective: Clinical prognosis prediction plays an important role in clinical research and practice. The construction of prediction models based on electronic health record data has recently become a research focus. Due to the lack of external validation, prediction models based on single-center, hospital-specific datasets may not perform well with datasets from other medical institutions. Therefore, research investigating prognosis prediction model construction based on a collaborative analysis of multi-center electronic health record data could increase the number and coverage of patients used for model training, enrich patient prognostic features and ultimately improve the accuracy and generalization of prognosis prediction.
   Materials and methods: A web service for individual prognosis prediction based on multi-center clinical data collaboration without patient-level data sharing (POPCORN) was proposed. POPCORN focuses on solving key issues in multi-center collaborative research based on electronic health record systems; these issues include the standardization of clinical data expression, the preservation of patient privacy during model training and the effect of case mix variance on the prediction model construction and application. POPCORN is based on a multivariable meta-analysis and a Bayesian framework and can construct suitable prediction models for multiple clinical scenarios that can effectively adapt to complex clinical application environments.
   Results: POPCORN was validated using a joint, multi-center collaborative research network between China and the United States with patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The performance of the models based on POPCORN was comparable-to that-of-the standard prognosis prediction model; however, POPCORN did not expose raw patient data. The prediction models had similar AUC, but the BMA model had the lowest ECI across all prediction models, indicating that this model had better calibration performance than the other models, especially for patients in Chinese hospitals.
   Conclusions: The POPCORN system can build prediction models that perform well in complex clinical application scenarios and can provide effective decision support for individual patient prognostic predictions.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS

DT Article
DE DDI extraction; Long short-term memory network; Attention model
AB The simultaneous administration of multiple drugs increases the probability of interaction among them, as one drug may affect the activities of others. This interaction among drugs may have a positive or negative impact on the therapeutic outcomes. Thus, identification of unknown drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is of significant concern for improving the safety and efficacy of drug consumption. Although multiple DDI resources exist, it is becoming infeasible to maintain these up-to-date manually with the number of biomedical texts growing at a fast pace. Most existing methods model DDI extraction as a classification problem and rely mainly on handcrafted features, and certain features further depend on domain-specific tools. Recently, neural network models using latent features have been demonstrated to yield similar or superior performance compared to existing models. In this study, we present three long short-term memory (LSTM) network models, namely B-LSTM, AB-LSTM, and Joint AB-LSTM. All three models use word and position embedding as latent features; thus, they do not rely on explicit feature engineering. Furthermore, the use of a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) network allows for extraction of implicit features from an entire sentence. The two models AB-LSTM and Joint AB-LSTM also apply attentive pooling in the Bi-LSTM layer output in order to assign weights to features. Our experimental results on the SemEval-2013 DDI extraction dataset indicate that the Joint AB-LSTM model produces reasonable performance (F-score: 69.39%) even with the simple architecture.

AB Skin cancer is a major public health problem with over 123,000 newly diagnosed cases worldwide in every year. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, responsible for over 9000 deaths in the United States each year. Thus, reliable automatic melanoma screening systems would provide a great help for clinicians to detect the malignant skin lesions as early as possible. In the last five years, the efficiency of deep learning-based methods increased dramatically and their performances seem to outperform conventional image processing methods in classification tasks. However, this type of machine learning-based approaches have a main drawback, namely they require thousands of labeled images per classes for their training. In this paper, we investigate how we can create an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks to improve further their individual accuracies in the task of classifying dermoscopy images into the three classes melanoma, nevus, and seborrheic keratosis when we have no opportunity to train them on adequate number of annotated images. To achieve high classification accuracy, we fuse the outputs of the classification layers of four different deep neural network architectures. More specifically, we propose the aggregation of robust convolutional neural networks (CNNs) into one framework, where the final classification is achieved based on the weighted output of the member CNNs. For aggregation, we consider different fusion-based methods and select the best performing one for this problem. Our experimental results also prove that the creation of an ensemble of different neural networks is a meaningful approach, since each of the applied fusion strategies outperforms the individual networks regarding classification accuracy. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve has been found to be 0.891 for the 3-class classification task. For an objective evaluation of our approach, we have tested its performance on the official test database of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017 challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection dedicated to skin cancer recognition.

AB Background: Modeling personalized treatment pathways plays an important role in understanding essential/critical treatment behaviors performed on patients during their hospitalizations and thus provides the opportunity for the improvement of better health service delivery in treatment pathways.
   Objective: Unlike traditional business process mining, modeling personalized treatment pathways is more challenging because they are typically case-specific. Although several studies have been devoted to modeling patient treatment pathways, limited efforts have been made on the extraction of latent semantics and their transitions behind patient treatment pathways, which are often ambiguous and poorly understood.
   Methods: In this article, we propose an extension of the Hidden Markov Model to mine and model personalized treatment pathways by extracting latent treatment topics and identifying their sequential dependencies in pathways, in the form of probabilistic distributions and transitions of patients' raw Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.
   Results: We evaluated the proposed model on 48,024 patients with cardiovascular diseases. A total of 15 treatment topics and their typical transition routes were discovered from EHR data that contained 1,391,251 treatment events with 2786 types of interventions and that were evaluated by ten clinicians manually. The obtained p-values are 0.000146 and 0.009106 in comparison with both Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Sequent Naive Bayes models, respectively; this outcome indicate that our approach achieves a better understanding of human evaluators on modeling personalized treatment pathway than that of benchmark models.
   Conclusion: The experimental results on a real-world data set clearly suggest that the proposed model has efficiency in mining and modeling personalized treatment pathways. We argue that the discovered treatment topics and their transition routes, as actionable knowledge that represents the practice of treating individual patients in their clinical pathways, can be further exploited to help physicians better understand their specialty and learn from previous experiences for treatment analysis and improvement.

AB Objective: Instruments rating risk of harm to self and others are widely used in inpatient forensic psychiatry settings. A potential alternate or supplementary means of risk prediction is from the automated analysis of case notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This exploratory study rated presence or absence and frequency of words in a forensic EHR dataset, comparing four reference dictionaries. Seven machine learning algorithms and different time periods of EHR analysis were used to probe. which dictionary and which time period were most predictive of risk assessment scores on validated instruments.
   Materials and methods: The EHR dataset comprised de-identified forensic inpatient notes from the Wilfred Lopes Centre in Tasmania. The data comprised unstructured free-text case note entries and serial ratings of three risk assessment scales: Historical Clinical Risk Management-20 (HCR-20), Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START) and. Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression (DASA). Four NLP dictionary word lists were selected: 6865 mental health symptom words from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 455 DSM-IV diagnoses from UMLS repository, 6790 English positive and negative sentiment words, and 1837 high frequency words from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). Seven machine learning methods Bagging, J48, Jrip, Logistic Model Trees (LMT), Logistic Regression, Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to identify the combination of dictionaries and algorithms that best predicted risk assessment scores.
   Results: The most accurate prediction was attained on the DASA dataset using the sentiment dictionary and the LMT and SVM algorithms.
   Conclusions: NLP, used in conjunction with NLP dictionaries and machine learning, predicted risk ratings on the HCR-20, START, and DASA, based on EHR content. Further research is required to ascertain the utility of NLP approaches in predicting endpoints of actual self-harm, harm to others or victimisation.

   text; Prior knowledge; Rel-TNG model; Type-TNG model
AB Semantic relation extraction is a crucial step of automatically constructing a knowledge graph from unstructured biomedical text. Many real-world applications can benefit from it. As unsupervised relation extraction approaches, generative probabilistic models, Rel-LDA and Type-LDA, are receiving more attention in recent years. However, these two models inherit the bag-of-word assumption of the standard LDA model, which disable the exploitation of more distinguishable n-gram features. To overcome this limitation, two alternative models, named as Rel-TNG and Type-TNG, are proposed with the help of Topic N-Grams (TNG) model in this study, and collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm is utilized for inference. Extensive experimental results on GENIA and EPI corpora indicate that Rel-TNG and Type-TNG models have similar performance with their unigram counterparts, but Rel-TNG and Type-TNG models outperform Rel-LDA and Type-LDA models when prior knowledge is available.

TI A convolutional route to abbreviation disambiguation in clinical text
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: Abbreviations sense disambiguation is a special case of word sense disambiguation. Machine learning methods based on neural networks showed promising results for word sense disambiguation (Festag and Spreckelsen, 2017) [1] and, here we assess their effectiveness for abbreviation sense disambiguation.
   Methods: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were trained, one for each abbreviation, to disambiguate abbreviation senses. A reverse substitution (of long forms with short forms) method from a previous study was used on clinical narratives from Cleveland Clinic, USA, to auto-generate training data. Accuracy of the CNN and traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were studied using: (a) 5-fold cross validation on the auto-generated training data; (b) a manually created, set-aside gold standard; and (c) 10-fold cross validation on a publicly available dataset from a previous study.
   Results: CNN improved accuracy by 1-4 percentage points on all the three datasets compared to SVM, and the improvement was the most for the set-aside dataset. The improvement was statistically significant at p < 0.05 on the auto-generated dataset. We found that for some common abbreviations, sense distributions mismatch between the test and auto generated training data, and mitigating the mismatch significantly improved the model accuracy.
   Conclusion: The neural network models work well in disambiguating abbreviations in clinical narratives, and they are robust across datasets. This avoids feature-engineering for each dataset. Coupled with an enhanced auto-training data generation, neural networks can simplify development of a practical abbreviation disambiguation system.

ID HEURISTIC EVALUATION; TECHNOLOGIES
AB Objective: To report a methodological approach for the development of a usable mHealth application (app).
   Materials and methods: This work was guided by a 3-level stratified view of health information technology (IT) usability evaluation framework. We first describe a number of methodologies for operationalizing each level of the framework. Following the description of each methodology, we present a case study which illustrates the use of our preferred methodologies for the development of a mHealth app. At level 1 (user-task), we applied a card sorting technique to guide the information architecture of a mobile HIV symptom self-management app, entitled mVIP. At level 2 (user-task-system), we conducted a usability evaluation of mVIP in a laboratory setting through end-user usability testing and heuristic evaluation with informatics experts. At level 3 (user-task-system-environment), usability of mVIP was evaluated in a real-world setting following the use of the app during a 3-month trial.
   Results: The 3-level usability evaluation guided our work exploring in-depth interactions between the user, task, system, and environment. Integral to the findings from the 3-level usability evaluation, we iteratively refined the app's content, functionality, and interface to meet the needs of our intended end-users.
   Discussion and conclusion: The stratified view of the health IT usability evaluation framework is a useful methodological approach for the design, development, and evaluation of mHealth apps. The methodological recommendations for using the theoretical framework can inform future usability studies of mHealth apps.

AB Growing demand for e-healthcare across the globe has raised concerns towards the secure and authentication enhanced medical image sharing. One of the services offered by health informatics in hospitals include an user interface through the Local Area Network (LAN) for enabling storage and access of medical records. In this paper, a security enhanced DICOM image sharing over a LAN addressing confidentiality, integrity and authentication has been proposed. Initially, the AES encrypted patient history was combined along with the thumb impression and Quick Response (QR) code of patient ID as watermark. This watermark was encrypted employing Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT), chaotic map and attractors with confusion-diffusion operations. Further, the encrypted watermark was embedded in the selected Region Of Non-Interest (RONI) pixels of DICOM image. Username & unique password credentials, Face identification and FPGA generated One Time Password (OTP) form the three layer authentication scheme for secure DICOM image access through the LAN. Web publishing medium of storing secured DICOM images in cloud has also been addressed in this work. To validate the proposed hybrid crypto-watermarking system, parameters such as key sensitivity, key space, correlation, entropy, histogram, cropping attack, Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) were performed and the results obtained have proved the strength of the proposed algorithm against brute force, statistical and cropping attacks.

AB Objective: Evaluate the quality of clinical order practice patterns machine-learned from clinician cohorts stratified by patient mortality outcomes.
   Materials and methods: Inpatient electronic health records from 2010 to 2013 were extracted from a tertiary academic hospital. Clinicians (n = 1822) were stratified into low-mortality (21.8%, n = 397) and high-mortality (6.0%, n = 110) extremes using a two-sided P-value score quantifying deviation of observed vs. expected 30-day patient mortality rates. Three patient cohorts were assembled: patients seen by low-mortality clinicians, high-mortality clinicians, and an unfiltered crowd of all clinicians (n = 1046, 1046, and 5230 post-propensity score matching, respectively). Predicted order lists were automatically generated from recommender system algorithms trained on each patient cohort and evaluated against (i) real-world practice patterns reflected in patient cases with better-than-expected mortality outcomes and (ii) reference standards derived from clinical practice guidelines.
   Results: Across six common admission diagnoses, order lists learned from the crowd demonstrated the greatest alignment with guideline references (AUROC range = 0.86-0.91), performing on par or better than those learned from low-mortality clinicians (0.79-0.84, P < 10(-5)) or manually-authored hospital order sets (0.65-0.77, P < 10(-3)). The same trend was observed in evaluating model predictions against better-than-expected patient cases, with the crowd model (AUROC mean = 0.91) outperforming the low-mortality model (0.87, P < 10(-16)) and order set benchmarks (0.78, P < 10(-35)).
   Discussion: Whether machine-learning models are trained on all clinicians or a subset of experts illustrates a bias variance tradeoff in data usage. Defining robust metrics to assess quality based on internal (e.g. practice patterns from better-than-expected patient cases) or external reference standards (e.g. clinical practice guidelines) is critical to assess decision support content.
   Conclusion: Learning relevant decision support content from all clinicians is as, if not more, robust than learning from a select subgroup of clinicians favored by patient outcomes.

AB Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a heterogeneous disease with poor survival in the advanced stage and a high incidence rate in the world. Novel drug targets are urgently required to improve patient treatment. Therefore, we aimed to identify therapeutic targets for LUAD based on protein-protein and protein-drug interaction network analysis with neural network algorithms using mRNA expression profiles.
   Results: A comprehensive meta-analysis of selective non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mRNA expression profile datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus were used to identify potential biomarkers and the molecular mechanisms related to the prognosis of NSCLC patients. Using the Network Analyst tool, based on combined effect size (ES) methods, we recognized 6566 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which included 3036 downregulated and 3530 upregulated genes linked to NSCLC patient survival. ClueGO, a Cytoscape plugin, was exploited to complete the function and pathway enrichment analysis, which disclosed "regulated exocytosis", "purine nucleotide binding", "pathways in cancer", and "cell cycle" between exceptionally supplemented terms. Enrichr, a web tool examination, demonstrated "early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1)", "hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A)", "mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAP3K14)", and "cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)" to be among the most prevalent TFs and kinases associated with NSCLC. Our meta-analysis identified that MAPK1 and aurora kinase (AURKA) are the most obvious class of hub nodes. Furthermore, protein-drug interaction network and neural network algorithms identified candidate drugs such as phosphothreonine and 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-n-[5-(2-thienylacetyl)-1,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazol-3-yl] benzamide and for the targets MAPK1 and AURKA, respectively.
   Conclusion: Our study has identified novel candidate biomarkers, pathways, transcription factors (TFs), and kinases associated with NSCLC prognosis, as well as drug candidates, which may assist treatment strategy for NSCLC patients.

A difference-based scoring approach was used to prioritize and select model features. A feature-constraint model was developed and evaluated to support the analysis of PSE reports.
   Methods: 5287 PSE reports manually coded as likely or unlikely related to HIT were used to train unigram, bigram, and combined unigram-bigram logistic regression and support vector machine models using five-fold cross validation. A difference-based scoring approach was used to prioritize and select unigram and bigram features by their relative importance to likely and unlikely HIT reports. A held-out set of 2000 manually coded reports were used for testing.
   Results: Unigram models tended to perform better than bigram and combined models. A 300-unigram logistic regression had comparable classification performance to a 4030-unigram SVM model but with a faster relative run-time. The 300-unigram logistic regression model evaluated with the testing data had an AUC of 0.931 and a F1-score of 0.765.
   Discussion: A difference-based scoring, prioritization, and feature selection approach can be used to generate simplified models with high performance. A feature-constraint model may be more easily shared across healthcare organizations seeking to analyze their respective datasets and customized for local variations in PSE reporting practices.
   Conclusion: The feature-constraint model provides a method-to identify HIT-related-patient safety hazards using a method that is applicable across healthcare systems with variability in their PSE report structures.

AB Introduction: Readmission from inpatient rehabilitation facilities to acute care hospitals is a serious problem. This study aims to develop a predictive model based on machine learning algorithms to identify patients at high risk of readmission.
   Methods: A retrospective dataset (2001-2017) including 16,902 patients admitted into a large inpatient rehabilitation facility in North Carolina was collected in 2017. Three types of machine learning models with different predictors were compared in 2018. The model with the highest c-statistic was selected as the best model and further tested by using five sets of training and validation data with different split time. The optimum threshold for classification was identified.
   Results: The logistic regression model with only functional independence measures has the highest validation c-statistic at 0.852. Using this model to predict the recent 5 years acute care readmissions yielded high discriminative ability (c-statistics: 0.841-0.869). Larger training data yielded better performance on the test data. The default cutoff (0.5) resulted in high specificity (> 0.997) but low sensitivity (< 0.07). The optimum threshold helped to achieve a balance between sensitivity (0.754-0.867) and specificity (0.747-0.780).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that functional independence measures can be analyzed by using machine learning algorithms to predict acute care readmissions, thus improving the effectiveness of preventive medicine.

TI Methodological variations in lagged regression for detecting physiologic
   drug effects in EHR data
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID TIME; INFORMATION; EVENTS
AB We studied how lagged linear regression can be used to detect the physiologic effects of drugs from data in the electronic health record (EHR). We systematically examined the effect of methodological variations ((i) time series construction, (ii) temporal parameterization, (iii) intra-subject normalization, (iv) differencing (lagged rates of change achieved by taking differences between consecutive measurements), (v) explanatory variables, and (vi) regression models) on performance of lagged linear methods in this context. We generated two gold standards (one knowledge-base derived, one expert-curated) for expected pairwise relationships between 7 drugs and 4 labs, and evaluated how the 64 unique combinations of methodological perturbations reproduce the gold standards. Our 28 cohorts included patients in the Columbia University Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital clinical database, and ranged from 2820 to 79,514 patients with between 8 and 209 average time points per patient. The most accurate methods achieved AUROC of 0.794 for knowledge-base derived gold standard (95%CI (0.741, 0.847]) and 0.705 for expert-curated gold standard (95% CI [0.629, 0.781]). We observed a mean AUROC of 0.633 (95%CI [0.610, 0.657], expert-curated gold standard) across all methods that re-parameterize time according to sequence and use either a joint autoregressive model with time-series differencing or an independent lag model without differencing. The complement of this set of methods achieved a mean AUROC close to 0.5, indicating the importance of these choices. We conclude that time series analysis of EHR data will likely rely on some of the beneficial pre-processing and modeling methodologies identified, and will certainly benefit from continued careful analysis of methodological perturbations. This study found that methodological variations, such as pre-processing and representations, have a large effect on results, exposing the importance of thoroughly evaluating these components when comparing machine-learning methods.

AB Gene ontology (GO) provides a representation of terms and categories used to describe genes and their molecular functions, cellular components and biological processes. GO has been the standard for describing the functions of specific genes in different model organisms. GO annotation, or the tagging of genes with GO terms, has mostly been a manual and time-consuming curation process. Although many automated approaches have been proposed for annotation, few have utilized knowledge available in the literature. In this manuscript, we describe the development and evaluation of an innovative predictive system to automatically assign molecular functions (GO terms) to genes using the biomedical literature. Because genes could be associated with multiple molecular functions, we posed the GO molecular function annotation as a multi-label classification problem with several classes. We used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for feature reduction and then classified the genes. To address the multi-label aspect of the data, we used the binary-relevance method. Although we experimented with several classifiers, the combination of binary-relevance and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier performed best. Our evaluation on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot dataset showed the best performance of 0.84 in terms of F1-measure.

AB Objective: Health information technology could provide valuable support for inter-professional collaboration to address complex health issues, but current HIT systems do not adequately support such collaboration. Existing theoretical research on supporting collaborative work can help inform the design of collaborative HIT systems. Using the example of supporting collaboration between child development service providers, we describe a deductive approach that leverages concepts from the literature and analyzes qualitative user-needs data to aid in collaborative system design.
   Materials and Methods: We use the Collaboration Space Model to guide the deductive qualitative analysis of interviews focused on the use of information technology to support child development. We deductively analyzed 44 interviews from two separate research initiatives and included data from a wide range of stakeholder groups including parents and various service providers. We summarized the deductively coded interview excerpts using quantitative and qualitative methods.
   Results: The deductive analysis method provided a rich set of design data, highlighting heterogeneity in work processes, barriers to adequate communication, and gaps in stakeholder knowledge in supporting child development work.
   Discussion Deductive qualitative analysis considering constructs from a literature-based model provided useful, actionable data to aid in design. Design implications underscore functions needed to adequately share data across many stakeholders. More work is needed to validate our design implications and to better understand the situations where specific system features would be most useful.
   Conclusions: Deductive analysis considering model constructs provides a useful approach to designing collaborative HIT systems, allowing designers to consider both empirical user data and existing knowledge from the literature. This method has the potential to improve designs for collaborative HIT systems.

AB The combined heat and power system is a highly efficient energy source for many applications because heat and power are often of high demand. Although fuel cells and thermoelectric generators are popularly known to be used separately for combined heat and power purposes, there is little research on combining these two components for this application. This research proposes to analyze the hybrid fuel cell and thermoelectric system specifically when it is used as a combined heat and power system - thus forming a newly proposed fuel cell and thermoelectric combined heat and power (FC-TE-CHP) system. The key idea is to use the thermoelectric device to further improve the exergetic and temperature performance of the conventional fuel cell based combined heat and power (FC-CHP) system. Both systems are analyzed and compared by using a steady state thermodynamic model from both the temperature and exergetic perspectives. The exergetic efficiency and temperature results are reported by performing parametric sweeps of several key parameters such as fuel cell stack electric power, operation in thermoelectric cooler mode, water mass flow rate and radiator air convection coefficient. Subsequently, recommendations on how the FC-TE-CHP system can be operated efficiently in terms of exergy are drawn.

AB This study presents the optimized hydrothermal gasification (HTG) and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of Cattle Manure (CM) and Cattle Feed (Canola Stalks) for hydrogen-rich gas, bio-oil and porous carbonaceous catalyst support production as a potential procedure to handle cattle wastes and produce valuable energy carriers. Our main objective in the present research was to produce H-2-rich gas from the wastes of dairy cattle in the presence of the efficient catalyst supported on a support that was prepared from the cattle feed. Therefore, with the aim of improving one of the momentous dimensions in the sustainable development that is the environmental protection, considerable efforts were focused on the maximum exploration of dairy cattle waste materials. Three operating parameters of temperature (380-440 degrees C), reaction time (5-30 min), and feed concentration (2.5-3.5 wt%) were examined and their optimized levels were found to be 440 degrees C, 20 min, and 2.5 wt%, respectively. The hydrothermal gasification was performed using Ni catalyst supported on activated carbon canola stalks (AC(CS)), CM hydrochar that was produced via the HTC and further ZnCl2 chemical activation of canola stalks, and the combination of AC(CS) and hydrochar (called blend) catalysts under the optimized conditions. The impact of catalyst supports on the distribution of gaseous products was assessed by various techniques and accordingly, the blend catalyst increased the H-2 and total gas yields by the factors of 1.73 and 1.66, respectively. Furthermore, the bio-oil of the HTG process was also collected and analyzed using GC/MS analysis and it was found that the CM bio-oil is rich in phenol and its derivatives, furans, Nitrogen-containing compounds, and aromatic molecular structures.

AB Compact-sized organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power generators require small-scale heat exchangers to achieve high power density. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a Brazed Metal-foam Plate Heat Exchanger (BMPHE) in an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) performance parameters. This evaporator is one of the first industrial full BMPHE which is composed by Nickle-foam with 25 PPI (pore per inch). In addition, a series of the experiments have been done using conventional Brazed Plate Heat Exchanger (BPHE) to make a comprehensive comparison for both cycles. Two parameters of power density and pressure gradient are introduced to make a clear comparison in addition to ORC performance parameters. Experimental data are presented for a 1-kW scroll expander and heat source temperatures between 80 and 120 degrees C. The results show that although the compact evaporator (BMPHE) increases the pressure drop by factors of 1.4-2.6, the overall performance of the ORC is not adversely affected, and the power density is increased by a factor of 2.5 in maximum.

AB The issue of energy poverty has devastating implications for the society, and it has been aggravated in the past years due to the economic crisis and the increase of energy prices. Among the most affected are those with low incomes and living in inefficient buildings. Unfortunately, the bitter reality is that sometimes this part of the population are facing the next question: Heating, or eating? The declining prices of distributed energy technologies such as photovoltaics provides an opportunity for positive social change. Although their use does not address energy poverty directly, substantial contributions may be made.
   Measurements of indoor temperatures in a social housing district of southern Spain in 2017 have revealed the unbearable temperatures that the occupants have to endure, both in summer and winter. Using this district as a case study, the present work aims to evaluate the benefits of exploiting its rooftop PV potential to cover part of the electricity consumption of the district (reducing the energy bills), and use the surplus electricity to supply power for the heat pumps in the district. Optimal alternatives regarding maximum PV production, maximum self-sufficiency ratio and minimum investment costs have been found, considering as well different options when sharing the available electricity surplus to improve the thermal comfort of the occupants. As far as the authors know, no previous study has followed an approach aimed at energy poverty alleviation such as the one presented in this work. The results show that using the surplus electricity to heat or cool the whole dwellings would improve the thermal comfort of the occupants in average up to 11% in winter and 26% in summer. If all the PV generation was used or more buildings in the area were employed to install PV modules, improvements up to 33% in winter and 67% in summer could be obtained, reducing at the same time the thermal comfort differences among the dwellings of the district.

AB Accurate and stable wind speed forecasting is essential for the planning, scheduling and control of wind energy generation and conversion in wind power industry. In this paper, a novel nonlinear hybrid model aiming at improving prediction performance of wind speed called LSTMDE-HELM is presented by using Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM), Hysteretic Extreme Learning Machine (HELM), Differential Evolution algorithm (DE), and nonlinear combined mechanism. First, to enhance the performance of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a biological neural system property called hysteresis is embedded into neuron activation function of ELM. Second, as there isn't a clear knowledge to set the number of hidden layers in LSTM and neurons count in each hidden layer, DE is introduced to optimize these numbers by minimizing a weighted objective function for keeping balance between learning performance and model complexity. Finally, the forecasting results of each predictor in LSTMDE-HELM are aggregated by a novel nonlinear combined mechanism composed of LSTM network and also the DE is used to optimize this LSTM. The proposed nonlinear hybrid model is employed on the data gathered from a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China. Two forecasting horizons i.e., ten-minute ahead (utmost short term) and one-hour ahead (short term) are adopted for experiments. Empirical results fully demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid model compared with other models in terms of four performance indices and statistical tests.

AB Solving the problems of water shortage and water pollution is a vital challenge for sustainable development. Different strategies, such as photodegradation, solar distillation, and filtration, have been proposed to purify contaminated water and generate clean water. Energy-efficient clean water generation technologies play a critical role in augmenting freshwater resources. Solar energy has the potential to increase sustainable clean water production, which is a key facet of the water-energy nexus. In this study, a novel strategy to generate clean water was realized via a synchronous solar distillation and photodegradation technology based on localized solar energy harvesting using a trifunctional solar energy absorbing membrane. The membrane is composited of mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membrane, hedgehog-like hierarchical ZnO particles (HP) and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). By floating the MCE/HP/Au membrane on rhodamine B contaminated water, the steam generation rate could reach up to similar to 8.70 kg/(m(2).h) and the concentration of organic pollutant in the residual water could be reduced to similar to 30% within two hours' solar light irradiation. It was found that the coupling between the hierarchical HPs and plasmonic Au NPs could enhance the solar light absorption and energy conversion for photodegradation and thermal generation. This work provides a new strategy for the high efficient utilization of solar energy for the clean water generation.
