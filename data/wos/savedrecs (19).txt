AB The 35S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) units that occur in tandem repeat are separated by an intergenic spacer (IGS) that plays an important role in rRNA transcription. Moreover, IGS is an important molecular marker for evolutionary research in plants. In the present study, the IGS sequence of Erianthus arundinaceus was isolated and sequenced for the first time. Structure analysis indicated the entire IGS sequence of three typical E. arundtnaceus genotypes was highly conserved, with approximately 3087 bp and 67.1% mean GC content. The putative transcription termination, and initiation sites as well as a large number of methylation sites were found to be present in the IGS of E. arundinaceus compared to other plants. The phylogenic tree constructed using the E. arundinaceus IGS sequence showed that Miscanthus sinensis var. glaber was genetically close to Saccharum spp. while E. arundinaceus was close to imperata cylindrica. Moreover, fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that IGS and pTa71 probes had the same locus at nucleolar organizer regions. Taken together, this work enhances our current understanding of the organization of IGS in E. arundinaceus and provides a molecular evidence for an evolutionary relationship between Saccharum spp., E. arundinaceus, L cylindrica and M. sinensis var. glaber.

AB The BCR-ABL1 oncogene is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) pathogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms that initiate leukemogenesis are still unclear. Cancer pathogenesis has been associated with genetic alterations that may lead to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is frequently deleted or inactivated in various tumors. A recently discovered variant of PTEN, PTEN-Long (PTENL), results from an alternative translation initiation site located upstream of the canonic AUG and generates a protein of 576 amino acids instead the expected protein of 403 amino acids. A 16 bp perfect palindromic motif centered on the PTEN-L CUG(513) start cotton is required for translation initiation. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of PTEN-L gene rsl 2573787 is located on the first exon respect to the CUG initiation site. In this case-control study we evaluated the association of genetic variants in PTEN-L with CML risk and therapy response in the Argentine population. The allele A of SNP rs12573787 was found to be associated with CML risk OR (95% CI) 1.71 (1.11-2.63) p = 0.016, which resulted consistent by multivariate analysis adjusted by gender and age. According to previous evidence that CML is more frequent in males, we found that the genetic risk of CML was confined to this gender. Unexpectedly, we also found this association confined to CML patients older than 45 years old. To our knowledge, this is the first time that PTEN-L rs1257378 was studied in CML suggesting that the variant A allele is a risk factor for CML development but, no association with the failure to TKIs treatment was found.

AB Objective: Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common female reproductive system tumors. In this study, we explored the clinical significance of Histone demethylase KDM5B gene and its effects on paclitaxel (PTX) sensitivity in EC.
   Method: First, we found that KDMSB expression significantly higher in EC tissues and cell lines. The elevated KDM5B expression was associated with high pathological grade and low PTX sensitivity. The functional role of KDM5B in PTX-resistant Ishikawa-R and HEC1A-R cells were examined by gene silencing experiments.
   Results: Knockdown of KDM5B resulted in the re-sensitization towards paclitaxel in both resistant cell lines. In addition, we also identified that microRNA-29c-3p (a tumor suppressor) was significantly lower in the EC cells and linked to the low PTX sensitivity of EC. The up-regulation of miR-29c-3p using exogenous mimic molecules markedly increased PTX sensitivity in both cell lines and reduced expression of KDM5B while the inhibitor of miR-29-3p resulted in the opposite effects. Notably, we also demonstrated that the level of miR-29c-3p was inversely correlated to the invasive, colony-forming abilities and PTX resistance in both cell lines. We also identified that miR-29c-3p has a binding site in the 3'UTR of the KDM5B gene, establishing a link of this signaling axis. In conclusion, high-expression of KDMSB is associated with the poor response to PTX in EC patients. Silencing of KDM5B led to the reversal of PTX resistance through miR-29c-3p/KDM5B pathway in EC.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which EC cells acquire paclitaxel resistance and potential this signaling as a theronostic marker for this malignancy.

AB Each year, cardiac diseases may cause a high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) that contained ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) may play important roles on cardiomyocytes differentiation. Further investigations underlying mechanisms of IncRNA-UC regulating embryonic heart development are necessary.
   In this study, we investigated the effects of Inc-uc.245 on proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and cardiomyocyte-like differentiation in P19 cells with DMSO stimulation, and hypothesized that inc-uc.245 would influence cardiomyocytes differentiation via FOG2. Lentiviral vectors of pGPU6/GFP/Neo-uc.245 and pGPU6/GFP/Neo-shRNA-uc.245 were respectively transfected into P19 cells to overexpress or silence uc.245. MIT assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining, scratch test and transwell assay were performed and the results showed that uc.245 overexpression could significantly suppress P19 cell proliferation, migration, cardiomyocyte-like differentiation but promote cell apoptosis. Contrarily, sh-uc.245 treatment caused the opposite changes. Uc.245 overexpression obviously downregulated the expression of cardiomyogenic-specific molecular markers (cTnI, ANP, alpha-MHC, Nkx2.5, GATA4, MEF2C) but remarkably upregulated the expression of FOG2. Subsequently, we transfected the recombinant vectors loaded FOG2 or shRRNA-FOG2 into P19 cells to further address the functional significance of FOG2 in uc.245-regulated cardiomyocyte-like differentiation. Interestingly, we found that overexpressing of FOG2 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and inhibited apoptosis both in uc.245 overexpressed and silenced P19 cells, especially in uc.245 silenced cell line. In addition, sh-FOG2 promoted cardiomyocyte-like differentiation and upregulated the expression of cardiomyogenic-specific markers at the gene and protein levels both in uc.245 overexpressed and silenced P19 cells. Similarly, this upregulation effect of sh-FOG2 was more obvious after uc.245 silencing.
   These findings suggest that FOG2 is a key mediator during uc.245-regulated differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes. It is expected that lnc-uc.245/FOG2 will become a promising therapeutic target for cardiac diseases.

AB Objectives: Tobacco smoking is a complex and multifactorial disease involving both environmental and genetic factors. In the Mexican mestizo population, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cigarette smoking and a greater degree of nicotine addiction have been identified; however, no possible roles have been explored in regard to the age of onset of smoking or in the success of quitting.
   Methods: In this study, 151 Mexican mestizo, who smoke cigarettes, were included. They were grouped according to the age at which they started smoking: those who started smoking before 18 years of age (early smokers, ES) and those who started smoking 18 years of age (late smokers, LS). In addition, relapse in smoking was evaluated at the first month after the end of treatment. Genetic association was evaluated characterizing 10 SNPs in 4 genes (CHRNAS, CHRNA3, NRXN1, and HTR2A).
   Results: According to the dominant model of genetic inheritance, rs6313 (CT-I-TT) of the HTR2A gene was associated (p = 0.0201) with cigarette consumption at early ages (OR = 2.68, CI = 1.18-6.07). When the risk of relapse was analyzed one month after the end of treatment, regardless of the age of onset, the T allele (rs6313) of HTR2A appeared to be a risk factor for relapse (OR = 2.92, 95% CI = 1.06-8.11); the T allele was found more frequently in those who relapsed (50.0%) compared with people who maintained abstinence (25.4%) (p = 0.0332).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in Mexican mestizos who smoke cigarettes, the presence of the T allele in rs6313 of the HTR2A gene increases the risk for the early onset of cigarette smoking as well as the risk for relapsing one month after completing smoking cessation treatment.

SO GENE

DT Article
DE Maternal stress; Birthweight; Relative telomere length; Children
ID HUMANS
AB Background: Previous studies indicate that low birth weight and exposure to maternal stress during pregnancy may result in shortened telomeres in infants. Shorter telomere length has in turn been linked with accelerated ageing and with age-related diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association between pregnancy and birth factors and relative telomere length in offspring at 11 years of age.
   Methods: Participants were aged 11 years enrolled in the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study at birth (n = 380). Half of the children were born small for gestational age (SGA = birthweight <= 10th percentile) and half were appropriate for gestational age (AGA = birthweight > 10th percentile). Maternal stress during pregnancy was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. Relative leukocyte telomere length (RTL) in leukocytes was measured at 11 years of age using quantitative real-time PCR.
   Results: RTL was normally distributed (mean = 3.78, SD = 1.05). There were no significant associations between RTL at age 11 years and birthweight, sex, maternal smoking, maternal stress during pregnancy or maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index.
   Conclusion: At age 11 years, RTL did not differ between children by birthweight or pregnancy-related stressors. Further telomere-related studies in newborns, children and adolescents are merited to increase knowledge of potential telomere modulating factors.

AB Increasing evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to tumorigenesis, progression and recurrence of various malignancies including Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Lnc-DILC is reported to be the tumor suppressor gene to play an important role in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the role of lnc-DILC in GBC remains to be elucidated. Herein, we show that lnc-DILC is upregulated in gallbladder CSCs and GBC patients' tissues. Knockdown of lnc-DILC attenuates the self-renewal, tumorigenicity, proliferation and metastasis of gallbladder CSCs. Mechanistically, lnc-DILC promotes gallbladder CSCs expansion via Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Special Wnt/beta-catenin inhibitor FH535 diminishes the discrepancy of self-renewal, growth and metastasis between lnc-DILC interference GBC cells and their control cells. In conclusion, lnc-DILC drives gallbladder CSCs self-renewal, tumorigenicity, proliferation and metastasis by activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and may therefore prove to be a potential therapeutic target for GBC patients.

AB Codon usage bias (CUB) is a universal feature of genomes, and in most species CUB of protein coding genes is positively correlated with expression level and degree of evolutionary conservation. There is mounting experimental evidence that CUB is due in part to selection for translational efficiency and/or accuracy, i.e., translational selection. However, there is a paucity of experimental data on whether and how CUB acts in turns - does the usage of preferred codons in a highly expressed gene affect the translation of other genes by freeing up more ribosomes, thereby increasing their availability to translate all mRNA transcripts in the cell? We investigated this question by creating two extreme versions of the highly expressed Escherichia colt beta-lactarnase (bla) gene, one comprised almost entirely of unpreferred codons, and a second comprised almost entirely of preferred codons. We monitored the fitness effects of these synonymous mutations over hundreds of generations in two selective environments that allowed us to disentangle translational effects acting in cis from those acting in trans. In a selective environment for maximizing translational efficiency in trans of a gene (tetA) encoding a tetracycline resistance protein, unpreferred synonymous mutations had a negative impact on long-term fitness, whereas preferred mutations had a positive impact on long-term fitness, providing strong experimental evidence for a pleiotropic effect of translational selection.

AB Soybean seed quality is often determined by its constituents which are important to sustain overall nutritional aspects. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of soil moisture stress during reproductive stage on seed quality and composition. Plants were subjected to five levels of soil moisture stresses at flowering, and yield and quality traits were examined at maturity. Seed protein, palmitic and linoleic acids, sucrose, raffinose, stachyose, N, P, K, and Ca significantly decreased whereas oil, stearic, oleic and linolenic acids, Fe, Mg, Zn, Cu, and B increased in response to soil moisture deficiency. The relationship between seed protein and oil was negatively correlated. The changes in seed constituents could be due to changes in nutrient accumulation and partitioning in soybean seeds under water stress. This information suggests the requirement of adequate soil moisture during flowering and seed formation stages to obtain the higher nutritional value of soybean seeds.

AB Biogenic amines are harmful substances generated during the fermentation process. Regulations on biogenic amine content in fermented foods are currently insufficient in comparison to the popularity of fermented food consumption in Asian countries. The current review evaluated the biogenic amine content of fermented soybean-based Asian foods to determine whether the food products are safe for consumption. Though the reported ranges of biogenic amine content in fermented soybean foods varied widely, most products contained biogenic amine concentrations at potentially hazardous levels. To ensure the safety of fermented soybean food products, further efforts are required in the improvement of the food manufacturing process, as well as the establishment of regulations on managing biogenic amine content.

AB This study investigates the effects of field pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) on the morphological structure and physicochemical properties of starches from four rice varieties during the rice harvesting period. The results of the study showed that PHS significantly affected the grain characteristics, starch structure, and physicochemical properties of the four rice varieties. Moreover, PHS led to a significant decrease in the grain processing quality and protein content of the four varieties, pitting and unevenness on the surface of the starch granules, and smaller starch granules. In addition, PHS led to starches with lower amylose content, which resulted in a higher swelling power, solubility, and relative crystallinity. Higher gelatinization enthalpy and lower gelatinization temperature were also observed under PHS conditions. The results indicated that PHS can lead to degradation in grain processing and appearance quality, but it can also lead to some improvements in the gelatinization properties of starch.

AB An analytical method for determining seleno-methionine (SeMet), methyl-seleno-cysteine and seleno-cystine in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) was developed and validated. EVOO sample (15 g) was diluted with hexane, extracted with methanol/water 80: 20 (v/v), and cleaned up by a reversed phase/strong cation exchange solid phase extraction. Analysis was performed by chiral hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Process efficiency ranged between 49 and 97% and trueness between 87 and 126%, with intermediate precision, expressed as standard deviation, lower than 10%. Method detection limits (MDLs) and method quantification limits (MQLs) were lower than 1 mu g kg(-1).
   Thirty-two EVOO samples from different Italian regions were analyzed for both total Se and single seleno-amino acids determination. Only L-SeMet was found at level MQL (0.2 mu g kg(-1))-1.42 mu g kg(-1) in ten samples, while total Se was in the range of MDL-9.1 mu g kg(-1). Concentration of L-SeMet (5-6% of total Se) and total Se correlated very well to each other (R-2= 0.995).

AB This study evaluated the relationship between cell wall breakdown, from Shiraz grapes harvested at three different ripeness levels and the colour and phenolics extracted during alcoholic fermentation into wines. Phenolic differences between the ripeness treatments were minimal after 1/4 of the fermentation was completed. However, colour and phenolic content were significantly higher in finished wines made from 25 degrees Brix grapes compared to those from 21 degrees Brix and 23 degrees Brix. Levels of grape cell wall polysaccharide deconstruction during fermentation was a determining correlative factor in relation to phenolic extractability. In this context, the de-pectination observed during ripening was found to enhance this deconstruction or "opening-up" of the grape pomace during fermentation, thus increasing the differential extraction of specific polyphenols, especially polymeric polyphenols, into the wines. Additionally, the degree of cell wall deconstruction seemed to play a role in the possible retention and extraction of specific grape proanthocyanidins, depending on their nature and polymer length.

AB Phenolic compounds play an important role in colour stability and sensory properties of red wine. This study evaluated berry skin cell wall composition and how this influences grape and wine phenolics at different ripeness levels (21 degrees Brix, 23 degrees Brix, and 25 degrees Brix) over two consecutive vintages. The vintage effect was highly significant, especially in the pectin fraction of the grape cell walls and affected the concentrations of certain phenolics extracted. The climatic variance between the seasons might have influenced the differences observed in the grape cell wall compositions. Firstly, a higher grape and wine phenolic content, especially in polymeric phenols, was found in 2015 wines. Additionally, grape berry cell walls, especially at the earliest stages of ripening, were found to be more intact in 2015 than in 2016. Thus, a possible relationship was found between the degree of berry intactness, especially for pectin-rich components, and the corresponding phenolic extractability during the winemaking.

AB We set up an efficient protocol for the rapid analysis of NMR spectra of green and roasted coffee extracts, enabling the automatic identification and quantification of metabolites in approximately two minutes per spectrum. This method allowed for the metabolic profiling and the subsequent evaluation of the content of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of coffee samples, depending on their species (Arabica and Robusta), geographical origin and extraction procedure (hydroalcoholic, espresso and moka).
   The hydroalcoholic extraction is the most efficient method in terms of yields of low molecular weight compounds (in particular chlorogenic acids), while moka extraction provides the highest amounts of melanoidins. Moreover, that the ratio between health-giving compounds (chlorogenic acids, trigonelline and choline) and caffeine is higher in Arabica coffees.
   The data collected provide useful insights for the selection of coffee raw material to be used in the preparation of coffee-based dietary supplements, nutraceuticals and functional beverages.

AB The effect of cooking on the taste compounds of five mushroom species Agaricus bisporus, Lactarius trivialis, Cantharellus cibarius, Cantharellus tubaeformis and Suillus variegatus were assessed with a special focus on the compounds responsible for the umami taste. Liquid chromatography was used to analyse free amino acids (FAAs) and 5'-nucleotides from fresh and sous vide (SV) cooked mushroom samples and cooking juice. The SV technique enabled analysis of entire mushrooms, including the liquid released during cooking. FAA content decreased when cooking temperature increased, indicating their further chemical reactions. S. variegatus contained highest concentrations of FAAs in analysed wild mushrooms. The umami-enhancing nucleotide 5'-GMP was detected only in cooked samples, concentration being likely dependent on enzymatic activity. The highest concentration of 5'-GMP was detected in cooked L. trivialis samples (17 mg/100 g fw). To our knowledge, the analysed taste compounds of L. trivialis and S. variegatus are documented for the first time.

AB A new multi-analytical strategy was developed to screen mycotoxins and their transformation products in nutraceuticals from green tea. Seven class mycotoxins were determined using a fully automated on-line extraction procedure followed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. This multi-analytical methodology has been explored providing an entire spectrum of fragment ion peaks for each mycotoxin, which allows unbiased high-throughput screening and quantitation of non-target mycotoxins. The validated mycotoxins exhibited satisfactory recoveries in the range of 82-108% in accordance with 2002/657/EC. The coefficients of linear determination were in the range of 0.9920-0.9999, with relative standard deviations were in the range of 3.2-14.9%. CC beta ranged between 0.022 mu g kg(-1) and 0.50 mu g kg(-1). The screening and confirmation method was applied to green tea nutraceuticals. Seven samples were found to be positive for mycotoxins at concentrations ranging from 0.23 mu g kg(-1) (3-acetyldeoxynivalenol) to 7.92 mu g kg(-1) (T-2 toxin).

AB Phenolic acids perform biological effects which are largely influenced by their binding to serum albumin. Therefore, investigating structure-affinity relationship of binding between phenolic acids and serum albumin is important. In this study, 114 phenolic acids and their derivatives, sharing the benzoic acid core with different substituents groups, were selected to investigate structure-affinity relationships with bovine serum albumin. The binding constants were obtained through fluorescence quenching, and a comprehensive mathematical model with inner-filter effect correction was applied. The results showed that the hydroxy group at the 2-position led to stronger binding affinity, while it had a negative influence at the 4-position. Substituting hydroxy groups with methoxy groups at 4-position and with methyl groups at 3-position both strengthened the binding affinity, respectively. Hydrogen bonding was one of the key binding forces for this binding interaction. Our findings provide a fundamental insight on the binding mechanism of phenolic acids to bovine serum albumin.

AB A controlled freeze-thawing test for wines is proposed to predict the deionization degree required for tartaric stabilization by electrodialysis. In this test, wine samples are frozen and then thawed in controlled conditions. The required deionization degree is estimated based on the difference of specific conductivity of the wines before and after the freeze-thawing cycle. The effect of freezing holding time and thawing time on the predicted deionization degree was investigated, using different types of red, rose and white table wines. For the recommended operating conditions, the freeze-thawing test gives reproducible results, which are between 5 and 9% higher than the corresponding values obtained by the mini-contact test at -4 degrees C during 4 h. The passive version of freeze-thawing test seems to be an expedite and reliable method that can yield in 24 h an estimate of the deionization degree of wines for tartaric stabilization by electrodialysis.

AB The analysis of general content of polyphenols, minerals and antioxidant activity of infusions from selected coffee substitutes is presented. The obtained results showed that the coffee infusions prepared from acorns exhibit the highest radical scavenging capacities for DPPH (EC50 = 0.063-0.066 mg(d.w)./mL), ABTS (EC50 = 0.021-0.029 mg(d.w)./mL), OH center dot(EC50 = 2.050-2.378 mg(d.w)./mL) as well as the highest ability to Fe3+ reduction (FRAP) (similar to 1.1 mmolFe/g(d.w)). These coffee substitutes also contain the greatest values of polyphenols (45-50 mgGA/g(d.w)). Analyzed coffee substitutes differ in both quality and quantity of polyphenols, but all tested coffees contain gallic and chlorogenic acids. The most of phenolic compounds was found in herbal-cereal coffee substitute. The quantitative results and PCA analysis indicated a good correlation between the antioxidant activity and total polyphenols, flavonoids and gallic acid content. Using the obtained data on the composition and antioxidant properties of extracts the cluster analysis (CA) was performed to distinguish similar or close types of coffee.

AB Dried, fermented blends of dairy products and cereals, such as kishk and tarhana, are foodstuffs traditionally consumed in many regions as they possess good nutritional qualities and extended storage stability. This study examined the nutritional composition of kishk or tarhana type products and compared with experimental blends of fermented milk and wheat bulgur containing 60-80% milk. The blends with higher milk contents had levels of protein (18.9%) and fat (5.8%) at the concentrations specified in fortified blended foods as outlined by the World Food Program. Higher milk contents were also associated with higher contents of calcium (323.2 mg/100 g), phosphorus (335.3 mg/100 g), vitamin A (486.7 mu g/100 g) and a-tocopherol (174.5 mu g/100 g). The nutritional content of the experimental fermented milk: wheat bulgur blends compared favourably with that of the commercial samples. These blends may be suitable as base products, to be fortified with micronutrients, for the development of fortified blended foods (FBFs) for humanitarian distribution.

AB In the western diet there is an oversupply of n-6 fatty acids. This adverse trend can be balanced by the consumption of rapeseed and flaxseed oils rich in a-linolenic acid (n-3). However, the high share of this fatty acid contributes to low oxidative stability of oil. Oxidation decreases n-3 fatty acid and other bioactive compounds contents, which adversely affects oil nutritional value. In this study, the impact of ferulic and sinapic acids vinyl derivatives on the fatty acids and oil terpenoids (sterols, tocols, carotenoids, squalene) retention at the end of induction period during accelerated oxidation of rapeseed and flaxseed cold-pressed oils was investigated. It was found that the use of 4-vinylsyringol (4-VS) or 4-vinylquaiacol (4-VQ) increased the retention of intact sterols and carotenoids (at least 2-fold) and squalene (at least 4-fold). The 4-VQ addition also inhibited the a-linolenic acid loss. Unfortunately, both phenolic derivatives favoured a-tocopherol decay in rapeseed oil.

AB The binding properties between gamma-lactone essences and HSA were investigated to explore interactional mechanism and influence of ligand side chains on binding via computer simulations, microscopy, and multiple-spectroscopies. Docking and molecular dynamics presented protein recognition mode with low fluctuations. NMR analysis revealed that the lactone ring of ligands was the main group bound to HSA. UV-vis and lifetime results revealed that the combination was static quenching mechanism with binding constants of 10(2)-10(3) L/mol. FTIR and CD spectra showed conformational changes in the protein secondary structure induced by ligands. Side chains affect the binding process through steric hindrance and hydrophobicity. AFM images showed the four compounds caused different effects on molecular size of HSA. In conclusion, the binding ability and the protein secondary structure changes had a positive correlation with the length of side chain. These studies are beneficial for understanding the safety and biological action of gamma-lactone essences.

AB The study evaluated the optimal condition for roasting sweet potato using response surface methodology. Proximate composition, antioxidant activity, volatile compounds, and water migration of roasted sweet potato were also determined. The results revealed that the optimal roasting condition included a roasting time of 40 min, a roasting temperature of 235 degrees C, and a roasting speed of 40 rad/min, the reducing sugar and vitamin C of roasted sweet potato obtained under optimal condition was 47.79 g/100 g (DW) and 60.25 mg/100 g (DW), respectively. After roasting, starch, protein and vitamin C content of sweet potato were significantly decreased, while total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were increased. 2-Methyl butanal was the main aromatic compound. Low-field NMR indicated that the proportion of free water increased and relaxation times (T-2) were decreased after roast process, indicated that the bound water in sweet potato was diffused from inside to outside, thus the texture became softer.

AB In recent years, food frauds and adulterations have increased significantly. This practice is motivated by fast economical gains and has an enormous impact on public health, representing an important issue in food science. In this context, this review has been designed to be a useful guide of potential biomarkers of food authenticity and safety. In terms of food authenticity, we focused our attention on biomarkers reported to specify different botanical or geographical origins, genetic diversity or production systems, while at the food safety level, molecular evidences of food adulteration or spoilage will be highlighted. This report is the first to combine results from recent studies in a format that allows a ready overview of metabolites (< 1200 Da) and potentially molecular routes to monitor food authentication and safety. This review has therefore the potential to unveil important aspects in food adulteration and safety, contributing to improve the current regulatory frameworks.

AB Caffeic acid is a natural phenylpropanoid that exhibits various health benefits. However, it suffers from a poor aqueous solubility limiting its application. This drawback could be overcome by complexation in cyclodextrins (CD) or co-solvency. Herein, we investigated, for the first time, the combined effect of CD and ethanol as co-solvent on complexation, solubilization and antioxidant activity of caffeic acid. Results showed that CD, ethanol and their combined use enhanced the solubility of this phenylpropanoid. However, the presence of ethanol affects the formation of inclusion complexes as lower formation constants (K-f) and complexation efficiencies (CE) were obtained while increasing the ethanol percentage (0-45% v/v). No inclusion complex could be observed at 45% v/v ethanol. These results were confirmed by 2D DOSY and 2D ROESY NMR experiments. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of caffeic acid in the combined system was enhanced consequent to its increased solubility.

AB A fast and accurate ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometric method was established to determine the presence of chlorogenic acid (CGA) according to potassium ferricyanide-Fe (III) detection system. The reaction temperature and pH level greatly influenced the CGA absorption spectrum. Maximum UV-vis absorption wavelength occurred at 790 nm under the optimum conditions (at 25 degrees C and pH 7.0). The results of UV-vis were further assessed by comparing the results with those of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The proposed method showed a wide linear sensing range of 10.0-800.0 mu g mL(-1) (R-2 = 0.9996) and a high degree of precision (% R.S.D. < 1.50) and recovery (% R.S.D. > 3.39). Results of CGA and HPLC methods correlated well with each other. The proposed accurate, rapid, sensitive, low-cost, and high-throughput method was successfully used to quantify CGA in fermentation broth and fruits (Mango). Therefore, it may be applied for measuring CGA in biological samples.

AB Sargassum serratifolium has been known to contain a high level of meroterpenoids as antioxidant components. We investigated antioxidant activities and active components in various solvent extracts from S. serratifolium. Ethyl acetate, ethanol, and methanol extracts showed relatively strong DPPH, ABTs, and superoxide radical scavenging activities. Hexane and ethyl acetate extract showed the strongest hydroxyl radical and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively, scavenging activities. Sargahydroquinoic acid (SHQA), sargachromanol (SCM) and sargaquinoic acid (SQA) were main antioxidant components in S. serratifolium. Ethanol extract showed the highest levels of SHQA, SCM, and SQA which comprised to be 227 +/- 6.31 mg/g. SHQA and SCM exhibited stronger antioxidant capacities than SQA based on lower IC50 values in ROS, DPPH, ABTs, and superoxide radical scavenging assays. The result showed that ethanol is the most efficient extracting solvent for the active components from S. serratifolium and the plant has the potential as a natural antioxidant.

AB Changes in physicochemical properties of fresh cut tender jackfruit during storage is depend on its colour. Colorimeter measurements are best for the samples with homogeneous colour. However, for samples with non-homogenous colors or large sizes (like fruits and vegetables), the colorimeters are inappropriate and inaccurate. The aim for this study is to quantify the amount of browning in fresh cut tender jackfruit slices by using image analysis technique and justify the results by comparing them with existing techniques like sensory examination, enzyme activity, and colorimeter. It can be concluded from the results that browning in fresh cut tender jackfruit slices increase rapidly in control and normally packed samples. Correlation coefficient as high as 0.963, represent that image analysis system is an accurate and highly consistent method to quantify the colour of fruits and vegetables.

Linoleic acid contents of the chia seed oil heated in microwave oven changed between 19.21% (900 W) and 21.17% (control), respectively (p < 0.05). Linolenic acid contents of heated chia seed oils varied between 66.84% (900 W) and 68.71% (control). alpha-Tocopherol and beta-tocopherol contents of the chia oil samples varied between 47.71 mg/100 g (900 W) and 51.17 mg/100 g (control) to 62.58 mg/100 g (900 W) and 67.81 mg/100 g (control), respectively. While caffeic acid contents of the oils change between 0.27 mg/g (900 W) and 3.84 mg/g (control), rosmarinic acid contents of chia seed oils were found between 1.32 mg/g (900 W) and 3.17 mg/g (control). Results reflect a change in the chemical structures of the chia oil. Overall, much care should be taken when roasting chia seeds in microwave to avoid lossess in the bioactive components of chia oil.

AB We developed a novel aptasensor based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and applied it for highly sensitive detection of microcystin-LR (MC-LR). In this work, MC-LR aptamer and its corresponding complementary DNA fragments (cDNA) were conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), respectively. Then, MC-LR aptamer-AuNPs and cDNA-MNPs conjugates were used as signal probes and capture probes, respectively. The proposed assay exhibited a linearity range from 0.01 to 200 ng/mL with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.002 ng/mL. In addition, the reliability of the novel approach was validated by detecting different levels of MC-LR spiked in tap water samples. Overall, the novel aptasensor paves a new way for rapid and accurate determination of MC-LR and can be referred to detect other hazardous substances in water products.

AB The impact of subcritical water processing (SWP), in a temperature range of 240-300 degrees C, on the formation of hydrolysates from bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated in this study. SDS-PAGE analysis of the samples treated at all temperatures did not reveal any bands. Yield, as evaluated by the Kjeldahl and Biuret methods, varied and decreased beyond 280 degrees C (P < 0.05). The molecular mass of the hydrolysates was highly affected by temperature, with the formation of a new low molecular weight peak, as revealed by gel permeation chromatography. SWP at 280 degrees C caused the greatest release of free amino groups, as shown by the TNBS assay (P < 0.05). Regardless of the type of amino acids, the maximum amount was obtained at 280 degrees C. At this temperature, the generation of alanine and glycine was relatively high. The optimization of processing parameters may enhance the production of valuable peptides without the need for additional catalysts.

AB Considering their diversity, this work evaluated physical properties of Amazonian fats/oils (murumuru, tucuma kernel, bacuri, pracaxi, patawa, and Brazil nut). Solid fat content (SFC) curves and crystallization/melting profiles were determined. We also explored the possibilities of combining these lipids into blends to improve their nutritional and technological aspects. Patawa, pracaxi, and Brazil nut oils presented high levels of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, displaying low atherogenicity and thrombogenicity indexes (0.10 and 0.18; 0.23 and 0.70; 0.20 and 0.42), respectively. The SFC curves showed that murumuru fat could be used as a cocoa butter replacer, whereas bacuri fat was found to be a promising alternative to hydrogenated oils in shortenings and spreads formulations. The blends expanded fats' melting ranges and enriched their fatty acid compositions from a nutritional standpoint. This work shows that these fats, oils and their blends may be suitable for developing new products in the food industry.

AB The practice of dry-hopping has been used by the brewing industry to obtain beers with increased contents of flavor and bitterness compounds. Notwithstanding this, other compounds such as alpha-acids (AA) and xhanthohumol (XN) are co-extracted influencing the final characteristics of the beer, particularly its beneficial bioactivity. In this context a model for the understanding of AA and XN extraction by dry-hopping is proposed. The varieties Chinook (CHI), East Kent Goldings (EKG) and Tettnanger (TET) were assayed and robust statistical approaches were applied for data interpretation. Concentration of AA in beers post-maturation reached values higher than 20 mg/L using 2.8 g/L of CHI hops and 10 days of maturation. For XN, a similar behavior was verified. The maximum efficiency of AA and XN extraction (transfer rate) were reached at 13.5 days with dose rates of 147 and 13.9 mg/L, respectively.

AB One of the most important factors that interfere negatively in coffee global quality has been blends with defective beans, especially those called Black, Immature and Sour (BIS). The methods based on visual-manual estimation of defective beans have shown their inefficiency in coffee value chain for large-scale analysis. The lack of fast, accurate and robust analytical methods for BIS determination is still a research gap. Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is a fast, low-cost and residue-free technique capable of performing multielemental determination and investigating organic composition of samples. In the present work, LIBS together with spectral processing and variable selection were evaluated to fit linear regression models for predicting BIS in blends. Models showed high capacity of prediction with RMSEP smaller than 3.8% and R2 higher than 80%. Most importantly, measurements are guided by chemical responses, which make LIBS-based methods less susceptible to the visual indistinguishability that occurs in manual inspections.

AB The impact of ripening on the dry-hop aroma potential and chemical development of Cascade hops is not well understood. Therefore, 5-6 weekly hop samples were collected over the 2014, 2015 and 2016 harvests. Concentrations of humulones did not change as a function of harvest date, while total hop essential oil content displayed significant positive trends. Concentrations of thiol precursors decreased over harvest while concentrations of free thiols increased. These weekly samples were used to dry-hop an unhopped base beer. Overall hop aroma intensity and citrus quality attributed to beer during dry-hopping increased as a function of harvest date. These results suggest that for brewers to maximize the efficiency of hop usage, early harvested Cascades might be better for bittering, while, later harvested Cascades might be better for dry-hopping or aroma additions because they attributed more intense citrusy aromas to beer and had higher concentrations of free thiols and terpene alcohols.

AB This research aimed to investigate the roles of phytohormone ethylene in cherry tomato fruit immune response against gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea. Pretreatment with antagonistic yeast Cryptococcus laurentii resulted in a significantly decreased disease incidence of B. cinerea infection, and accompanied by a burst of ethylene production in the whole fruit. Blocking the ethylene perception by adding 1-MCP (5 mu L L-1 or greater) remarkably weaken the protection ability of fruit itself and suppressed the C. laurentii-stimulated host immune response. 5 mu L L-1 1-MCP prefumigation decreased the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and perception related genes SlACO1, SlACS2, SlERF1, SlPti5 and SlMPK3, and ethylene production in C. laurentii treated fruit. Consequently, the expressions of SlCHI9, SlGlub, SlPAL3, SlPR1 and SlPR5 up-regulated by the yeast were all impaired to different degrees by the 1-MCP prefumigation. These findings demonstrate that ethylene contributes to fruit immunity and C. laurentii-mediated immune responses of cherry tomato.

AB We monitored the major chemical composition of bulk dromedary camel milk by FT-MIR spectroscopy over a 5-year period. The results highly correlated with those determined with reference methods (r > 0.985, p < 0.001). Production parameters showed significant (p < 0.001) seasonal and yearly changes. The overall mean fat, protein, lactose, solids-not-fat, and total solids concentrations of bulk dromedary camel milk were 2.87%, 2.94%, 4.15%, 8.00%, and 10.69%, respectively. Month of the year, year of the study, and level of production had a strong influence on bulk milk chemical composition and yield of milk components; however, the relative effect of season on composition was greater (proportion of variance app. 50%) compared to that of other factors of variation. The highest and lowest values were measured during winter and summer, respectively. Circannual variation in major milk components was associated with environmental conditions (photoperiod, temperature), whereas it was independent of nutritional factors.

AB Sweet bell pepper is a perfect source of flavonoids and carotenoids. Some experiments indicated that fresh organic vegetables contained more of these bioactive compounds in comparison to the conventional ones. It could be expected that pickled organic vegetables also contain more antioxidant compounds. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse and to compare the concentration of bioactive compounds in organic vs. conventional pickled bell pepper. Two cultivars of sweet red pepper (Roberta and Berceo) from organic and conventional cultivation were used in the experiment. The content of dry matter, polyphenols and carotenoids in fruit has been determined. The conventional pickled bell pepper fruits appeared to be richer in phenolic acids, while organic samples contained significantly more flavonoids, including myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, apigenin, and carotenoids such as beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, capsorubin, cryptoxanthin and cryptoflavin in comparison to the conventional ones.

AB A fast method for the determination of methylxanthines in cocoa products and drugs based on PS-MS/MS under MRM condition has been developed. Analyte ions were generated by applying a high voltage on a paper substrate drenched of sample extract using a small volume (similar to 15 mu L) of spray solvent. The gas phase chemistry of the molecules under investigation has been elucidated. The accuracy values of the methodology ranged from 95 to 110%, while the analytical parameters LOQ, LOD, recovery and reproducibility, calculated analyzing spiked samples, confirmed the consistency of the proposed method. Furthermore, real samples have been analyzed both by the developed methodology and by using a classical HPLC-UV approach obtaining comparable values.

AB This study aimed to improve the bread quality by adding acetic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid and citric acid to its ingredients. The underlying mechanism was explored through the changes in the yeast activity, proteolysis and amylolysis. All organic acids gave bread a higher specific volume, a lower moisture content, a lower pH value and a decreased hardness. Moreover, the yeast activity was enhanced, whereas the gas retention capability decreased in acidified doughs. Organic acids also reduced the molecular weight of proteins and starches, which led to the increase of NH2, free SH and reducing sugar contents. These changes were the most significant in the dough with 0.3% fumaric acid. Proteolysis and amylolysis mainly occurred after dough mixing and depended on the types of acids present in the mixture. Nevertheless, the cleavage of disulfide bonds in gluten might rest with the H+ concentration in the dough system.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the process time (5, 10, and 15 min) and flow rate (10, 20, and 30 mL/min) of cold plasma technology on physio-chemical characteristics (pH), bioactive compounds (DPPD, Total Phenolic Compounds, ACE-inhibitory activity values), fatty acid composition, and volatile compounds profile of chocolate milk drink. The mild (lower flow rate and process time) and more severe (higher flow rate and process time) conditions led to a reduction of the bioactive compounds (total phenolic compounds and ACE-inhibitory activity), changes in fatty acid composition (increased saturated fatty acid and decreased monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid), less favorable health indices (higher atherogenic, thrombogenic and hypercholesterolemic saturated fatty acids and lower desired fatty acids), and lower number of volatile compounds. In contrast, in intermediate cold plasma conditions, an adequate concentration of bioactive compounds, fatty acid composition, and health indices, and increased number of volatile compounds (ketones, esters, and lactones) were observed. Overall, cold plasma technology has proven to be an interesting alternative to chocolate milk drinks, being of paramount importance the study of the cold plasma process parameters.

AB Modified maize starches were obtained by the esterification of native starch with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) at levels of 3% or 9%, and afterwards by its complexation with metal ions. The degree of substitution, contents of metal ions, hydrodynamic size distribution, intrinsic viscosity, pasting characteristics of the tested starches, and pastes surface tension were determined. Moreover, emulsions prepared from the modified starches were studied for oil droplet size distribution and storage stability. Reduction of hydrodynamic size and intrinsic viscosity was observed in octentyl succinate starch (OS starch) esterified with 3% OSA complexed with magnesium or calcium. The presence of potassium in both esterified starches increased their water binding capacity and solubility in water. In most cases, complexation with metal ions decreased viscosity of OS starch pastes. Emulsions prepared from the modified starches had smaller oil droplets and were more stable during storage, compared to the systems prepared from non-esterified starch.

AB The interactions between dietary fiber (DF)-bound antioxidants and free antioxidants, with different substitution patterns of -OH and -OCH3 groups on their aromatic rings has been investigated. The activity and efficiency of these interactions were examined with a structural approach. Whole wheat (WW) DF-bound antioxidants and 21 hydroxycinnamic acid/hydroxybenzoic acids (HCA/HBA) were used in the experimental studies. Studies were performed in liposome and aqueous media by monitoring lipid oxidation and scavenging of DPPH radical in the presence of WW-bound antioxidants and HCA/HBA derivatives. Predominantly synergistic interactions were observed in aqueous medium, while both synergistic and antagonistic interactions were seen in liposome medium. Concentrations of HCA/HBA and WW-bound antioxidants in mixtures and their 2-way interactions made significant effect on lipid oxidation and radical scavenging reactions, with some exceptions. HCA/HBA derivatives with 3,4 -dihydroxyphenyl substitution acted as strong antioxidants in liposome medium, while the number of -OH groups affected antioxidant activity in aqueous medium.

AB Free essential oils and their active components have a low physiochemical stability and low aqueous solubility which limit their applications as food preservatives and in packaging industry. The aim of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties, antioxidant activities and antimicrobial activity of randomly methylated beta cyclodextrin (RAMEB) encapsulated thyme oil, lemon balm oil, lavender oil, peppermint oil and their active components that include thymol, citral, linalool, menthol and borneol. Inclusion complex formation of essential oils (EOs) and RAMEB were evaluated by several methods. Antioxidant capacities of RAMEB-EOs/components were reported to be more stable than free EOs/components (P < 0.05). Rapid SYBR green I/propidium iodide live/dead microbial cellular discrimination assay for Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed similar results when compared with flow cytometry analysis (P < 0.01) suggesting that our novel microplate fluorescence method could be applied for the fast live/dead microbial discrimination in antimicrobial assays.

AB This research work evaluates the feasibility of a smartphone-based spectrometer (740-1070 nm) for salted minced meat composition diagnostics at industrial scale. A commercially available smartphone-based spectrometer and a benchtop NIR spectrometer (940-1700 nm) were used for acquiring 1312 spectra from meat samples stored at four different temperatures ranging from -14 degrees C to 25 degrees C. Thereafter, for each spectrometer, PLS and Random Forest regression models specific for each temperature and global models were created to predict the fat, moisture and protein contents. Fat and moisture can be estimated with the global model in a wide range of temperatures by using the smartphone-based spectrometer, which has an acceptable accuracy for quality control purposes (RPD > 7) and comparable to the accuracy of a benchtop spectrometer.

AB Poly(beta-cyclodextrin functionalized ionic liquid) immobilized magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@beta CD-Vinyl-TDI) as sorbent in magnetic mu-SPE was developed for the determination of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in rice samples coupled with gas chromatographic-flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The nano-composite was characterized by various tools and significant parameters that affected the extraction efficiency of PAHs were investigated. The calibration curves were linear for the concentration ranging between 0.1 and 500 mu g kg(-1) with correlation determinations (R-2) from 0.9970 to 0.9982 for all analytes. Detection limits ranged at 0.01-0.18 mu g kg(-1) in real matrix. The RSD values ranged at 2.95%-5.34% (intra-day) and 4.37%-7.05% (inter-day) precision for six varied days. The sorbents showed satisfactory reproducibility in 2.9% to 9.9% range and acceptable recovery values at 80.4%-112.4% were obtained for the real sample analysis. The optimized method was successfully applied to access content safety of selected PAHs for 24 kinds of commercial rice available in Malaysia.

AB Different methods used to process green tea powder noodles (GTPN) were compared by analyzing the quality and chemical components of the final products. Significant differences were observed in the discoloration rate, color loss, and lightness of all noodles. Polyphenol oxidase activity was effectively inhibited through the heat treatment, resulting in retardation of the GTPN discoloration rate. However, heat-exposed GTPN showed a higher surface lightness due to a greater loss of chlorophyll. The chlorophyll contents of GTPN prepared with a new method (a combination of water treatment and heat exposure) were prominently higher than those prepared by heat treatment alone, and exhibited less color loss. The heat-exposed noodles had relatively low free polyphenol contents, and their textural properties were not significantly decreased after 28 d. Therefore, combining water treatment and heat exposure in the preparation process has great potential for increasing the stability of GTPN.

Open field trials were conducted in a randomized block system with four repetitions over two years. Treatment for plant disease control comprised four spraying programs, two within each production system. Yields were significantly affected by cultivar, pest management system and their interaction. Copper-free integrated and organic spraying programs were almost as effective in disease control as standard treatments which included copper preparations. The spraying program significantly affected the contents of vitamin C, alpha-tocopherol, phytoene, and beta-carotene in fruits; however, the effect was cultivar related. The lycopene contents appeared to be unaffected by the spraying program or growing system.

AB Heat-moisture treatment (HMT) could be applied to increase the relative crystallinity (RC) of raw waxy maize starch (WMS) and mar the dense surface of starch granules. The optimal HMT conditions including temperature, treatment time, and moisture content were determined by response surface methodology (RSM). When the temperature, treatment time, and moisture content were 99.2 degrees C, 1.8 h, and 18.2%, respectively, the maximum RC of heat-moisture treated starch (HMTS) could reach to 42.44% and more holes, depressions, and cracks appeared on the surface of HMTS. Afterwards, HMTS was subjected to acid hydrolysis to prepare starch nanocrystals (SNCs). It was confirmed that SNCs could be successfully obtained with a hydrolysis time of 4 days and a yield of 26.7%. The results revealed that this method was more effective than conventional sulfuric acid hydrolysis method with a hydrolysis time of 5 days and a yield of 15.7%.

AB An anthocyanin-rich double emulsion (w/o/w) was prepared via a two-step emulsification method. Anthocyanins from black rice extract were incorporated in the inner water phase and dispersed inside the middle oil phase, which was then dispersed into the outer water phase. Generation of the double emulsion was confirmed by optical microscopic analysis and its microencapsulation efficiency was 99.45 +/- 0.24%. An in vitro digestion study was carried out to evaluate anthocyanin concentration changes and release characteristics of the double emulsion using simulated gastrointestinal fluids. After 2 h incubation in the simulated gastric fluid, the percentage of diffused anthocyanins was 3.66 +/- 2.32%. These observations indicate that the double emulsion could control the release of anthocyanins in the stomach. During incubation in the simulated intestinal fluid, a total release of anthocyanins in the double emulsion was observed within the first 20 min. A pH-dependent degradation of anthocyanins was also evident.

AB Microwave and conventional heating methods were used to extract pectin from lime peel waste using different acid extractants (hydrochloric or citric acid) and peel-to-extractant ratios (1: 20 or 1: 40). Hydrochloric acid as the extractant resulted in a higher yield of pectin with both methods. The methoxyl content and galacturonic acid content of lime peel pectin were in the range 8.74-10.51% and 79.29-95.93%, respectively. The intense band around 1730 cm(-1) corresponded to methyl esterified uronic carboxyl groups and confirmed the higher equivalent weight and degree of esterification for the microwave-extracted pectin than that from conventional extraction. Lime peel pectin could be classified as high methoxyl pectin having a rapid-set gel formation. The viscosity and viscoelastic properties of the pectin solution from both heating methods enhanced with increasing solid concentration. Hence, microwave heating can be a short processing time for pectin extraction from lime peel waste with suitable pectin properties.

AB The present study has exploited the rapidity of the analysis and the multi-elemental capability of the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) technique for the mineral profile determination in cocoa powder. A fast, cheap and environmental sustainable method without reagent consumption or toxic waste generation has been proposed. The samples can be prepared in the form of pellets of 13 mm in diameter and 2-3 mm thickness. The different internal calibrations used by ED-XRF equipment did not provide accurate results when comparing the mineral profile with the concentration obtained by Inductively Couple Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) after microwave assisted digestion of samples. For direct ED-XRF analysis of the cocoa samples, an external calibration using as standards the cocoa samples diluted with sugar was prepared. The analytical parameters of Relative Standard Deviation and Limit of Detection for the determined elements are adequate to the concentration levels found in the samples.

AB The current study performed simultaneous identification of semisynthetic chlorophyllin (Cu-Chl) and synthetic food colorants in food matrices. The quantitative assessment of these synthetic and semisynthetic colorants was determined by using analytical method based on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) equipped with UV-visible detection. The concentration of Cu-Chl in hard candy was 3.334 mg/kg and 4.489 mg/kg in the soft candy, while contents of other colorants i.e. Tartrazine and Brilliant Blue were within 4.74-140.284 mg/kg. The extraction of Cu-Chl and synthetic colorants from different food matrixes was performed with a recovery range of 90-97% and RSD of 1-9%. Overall, the current developed RP-HPLC method could detect both green coloured synthetic and semisynthetic food colorants by a single run and could be used for monitoring different colorants in other complex matrices. This is the first report in India to determine Cu-Chl in foodstuffs and beverages by using RP-HPLC with UV-vis detector.

AB alpha-Lactalbumin (ALA) is a Ca2+-binding protein which constitutes up to 20% of whey protein. At acidic pH, and in the apo-state at elevated temperatures, ALA is the classic 'molten globule' (MG). This study examined epigallocatechin- 3-gallate (EGCG) binding to ALA in its apo form (apoALA) and stabilizing effect on protein structure thereof.
   EGCG binds to apoALA in both native and MG state. The complex of EGCG and ALA is more stable to thermal denaturation. The docking analysis and molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) showed that Ca2+ removal decreased conformational stability of ALA, because of the local destabilization of Ca2+-binding region. EGCG binding to apoALA increases its stability by reverting of conformation and stability of Ca2+-binding region. Therefore, EGCG-induced thermal stability of apoALA is based on increased apoALA conformational rigidity. This study implies that during gastric digestion of tea with milk EGCG would remain bound to ALA, albeit in the Ca2+-free form.

AB The aim of this work was to study the formation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with low (corn and olive oil) or high temperature melting lipids (cocoa butter and hydrogenated coconut oil). Moreover, their beta-carotene stability and in vitro digestibility kinetics was evaluated. Submicron LNPs (d(43) approximate to 570-780 nm) were stabilized with Tween 80 at a surfactant-to-oil ratio (SOR) of 0.1. It was reduced below 200 nm at an SOR of 1. The beta-carotene retention at 25 degrees C was not related to the lipid type but rather to the particle size, being lower in samples with smaller particle sizes. Cocoa butter LNPs presented an equally complete digestion as corn oil LNPs and a high beta-carotene bioaccessibility, which was related to the high degree of micellarization of monoacylglycerols. This work evidences the potential of LNPs to protect lipophilic bioactive compounds with a high digestibility and bioaccessibility.

AB The aim of the present article was an in-depth characterization of cyanidine-rich red cabbage extracts and the identification of challenges emerging during the purification of their pigments. Two extraction procedures using either hot acidified or temperate water at its genuine pH were compared. LC-MS analyses revealed 20 mostly acylated anthocyanins, five aliphatic glucosinolates, and four indolic glucosinolates as non-volatile constituents. In addition, volatiles were characterized by HS-SPME-GC-MS. Whereas the glycosidic precursors do not impair the sensory properties, their enzymatic degradation products may evoke unpleasant flavors. The crude pigment extract obtained with hot acidified water contained low concentrations of C6 aldehydes, isothiocyanates, nitriles, and sulfides, and was selected for purification experiments. Amberlite XAD 16 HP, polyamide, chitosan, and lignosulfonate were used as adsorbents and flocculants. Particularly, Amberlite and lignosulfonate treatment diminished the content of glucosinolates and volatiles. Interestingly, indolic glucosinolates and acylated anthocyanins showed similar behavior in all purification procedures performed.

AB During the last years, the food industry is working on the replacement of high energy methodologies with more sustainable techniques for the encapsulation of natural preservatives, in order to enhance their effectiveness as food additives. In the present study, nisin, an antimicrobial agent, was encapsulated in essential oil-containing microemulsions. More specifically, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and dittany essential oil-containing microemulsions were formulated to encapsulate nisin enhancing the system's overall antimicrobial activity. The systems were investigated for the interfacial properties and size of the surfactants' monolayer using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. Subsequently, nisin-loaded microemulsions were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus, using the well diffusion assay. Finally, this technique was validated by a killing assay. Overall, this study provides important information on the antibacterial activity of nisin-loaded nano-carriers enhanced by essential oils, in relation to the microemulsions' structure.

AB Centaurium erythraea Rafn is a food flavouring used in both food and beverage industries. Despite the existence of some works on this species, only few focus their attention on its common form of consumption (infusion). Thus, we intended to explore the chemical composition and the biological properties of infusions from C. erythraea aerial parts. Phenolic compounds were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn, twenty-two flavonoid derivatives being reported for the first time. Concerning to the biological potential, the best scavenging activity was observed for the superoxide anion radical. Moreover, this extract revealed to have some effect on the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, no cytotoxicity against RAW 264.7 macrophage cells line, and a weak potential to decrease the nitric oxide levels in this cell system. The results suggest that C. erythraea aerial parts could be valuable sources of health benefits compounds, contributing to its valorisation and its further application in functional foods.

AB Carryover color in the whey fluid is one of the major challenges faced by the cheese manufacturing industry. In this study, we describe a solvent-mediated high-pressure process to complexate bixin and casein micelles as a novel strategy for color delivery. High pressures (120 and 240 MPa) and added ethanol resulted in change in casein hydrophobicity by exposure of tryptophan residues, as confirmed by spectroscopic methods. The incorporation of bixin resulted in a marked quenching of the fluorescence peak associated with tryptophan. A simulated coagulation study has shown that pressure-treated complexes resulted in whey powder with significantly lower a* values than unbleached whey, whereas no significant differences were observed for b* values. The results suggest that complexes can produce curds with a color similar to that using commercial annatto powder and whey powder with equal or superior color quality than obtained with chemical bleaching.

AB The impact of glycosylation on anthocyanin stability has largely been associated with sugar type, site, and size, with glycosyl stereochemistry being under-explored. Seven cyanidin-3-glycosides were isolated by HPLC, diluted in pH 1-9, mixed with bisulfite or ascorbic acid at pH 3, and stored for 8 weeks ( 25 degrees C, dark). Spectral changes, half-lives, and bleaching rates were determined. Cyanidin-3-galactoside was more reactive ( susceptible to hydration and bleaching) than cyanidin-3-glucoside. The 1 -> 2 disaccharides exhibited greater lambda(vis-max) (<= 16 nm), resistance to hydration, and bleaching compared to 1 -> 6 disaccharides. The 1 -> 6 disaccharides had similar lambda(vis-max) (similar to 2 nm) to the monosaccharides but slightly improved resistance to hydration and bleaching. The tri-gly-cosylated anthocyanin had the greatest stability and its spectral and bleaching characteristics was intermediate to 1 -> 2 and 1 -> 6 disaccharides. The 1 -> 2 disaccharides generally exhibited lower half-lives compared to monosaccharides; whereas, 1 -> 6 disaccharides exhibited higher stability. These findings highlight the role of glycosyl assembly on anthocyanin reactivity and stability.

AB Obscure pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus) softening during frozen storage remains to be solved. This study was therefore aimed to provide explanations by differentiate the roles of three potential factors in fish softening. The influences of ice crystal, endogenous proteolytic activities, and oxidization were distinguished by treatment of fish fillets with liquid nitrogen, iodoacetic acid, and tea polyphenol with ascorbic acid, respectively. This distinguishing method was verified to be effective by investigation in ice crystal microstructure, endogenous proteolytic activities and lipid and protein oxidation. In comparison of three factors, it showed that the shear force of fish fillets with smaller ice crystals was about 15.5% and 13.7% higher than those with the inhibition of endogenous proteolytic activities and oxidation respectively, indicating the dominant role of ice crystal in frozen fish softening. Besides, quality decline of frozen fish was initially fast and then slowed down during the storage.

AB Malolactic fermentation (MLF) and oak barrels aging are two oenological processes which modify wine composition and sensory characteristics. The effect of MLF-container (stainless steel tanks, barrels) and barrel toasting (T1, T2, T3) on ellagitannin concentration, volatile composition and sensory attributes of Chardonnay wines was evaluated.
   Barrel toasting had higher impact on ellagitannin content than MLF-container. When comparing both MLF-modalities, barrel-fermented wines exhibited greater amounts of vanillin and whiskey-lactones but lower concentrations of fruity aroma compounds.
   Regarding sensory analysis, greater citrus and floral aromas were perceived for MLF-tank wines, and higher nuts aroma for MLF-barrel wines. Using barrels as MLF-containers i) did not change the aroma perception defining Chardonnay character (peach, apricot and gun flint); ii) did not impact the aromatic intensity and persistence, sweetness, acidity, mouthfeel volume and/or bitterness; and iii) did not confer significantly higher overall woody aromas which might mask fruity, floral and mineral (gun flint) character.

AB Chlorogenic acid (5CQA) is a dietary polyphenol known for its high biological activity. Antioxidative behavior of 5CQA relative to trolox (Tx) toward the HO center dot and CH3OO center dot radicals in aqueous solution at pH = 7.4 was simulated using density functional theory.
   This is the first study where behavior of monoanion and dianion of 5CQA at physiological conditions is described. Both anionic forms undergo only hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism with CH3OO center dot. With HO center dot, anionic forms of 5CQA conform to the HAT, radical adduct formation, sequential proton loss electron transfer, and single electron transfer - proton transfer mechanisms. Contribution of dianion to scavenging HO center dot is comparable to that of more abundant monoanion. The calculated rate constant for overall reaction of 5CQA with HO center dot is in perfect agreement with the corresponding experimental value. In comparison to Tx, 5CQA is more reactive toward HO center dot, but less reactive toward CH3OO center dot.

AB Two kinds of pasta were produced: dry Maccheronccinis pasta and fresh Cicatellis pasta. Four formulations were made for each type: control pasta made with 100% semolina and enriched pasta containing different levels of broad bean flour. Thermal properties were measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry and revealed that only dried pasta induced gelatinization peaks. Enriched samples had higher T-o, T-p and T-c values but lower gelatinization enthalpy than the control. Retrogradation temperature tended to decrease as the level of bean flour increase, both in dry and fresh pasta. The Rapid Visco Analyser data revealed significantly (p < 0.05) lower values for pasting temperature in dried pasta. All other parameters showed higher values for Maccheronccinis compared to Cicatellis. Peak, trough and final viscosities, breakdown and setbacks decreased as the percentage of added flour increased. Texture analysis showed that fresh pasta was stickier than dry pasta, while firmness was similar between the two types.

TI Insights into ice-growth inhibition by trehalose and alginate

AB Cryoprotective saccharides are widely accepted antifreeze additives that reduce thawing loss, maintain texture, and retard protein denaturation in frozen seafood. In this study, the inhibition effects of trehalose and alginate oligosaccharides on ice growth were investigated and compared with sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7) treatment in peeled shrimp during frozen storage, especially the interactions between saccharide molecules and ice crystals. The microstructural results demonstrated that the pre-soaking of trehalose and alginate oligosaccharides before freezing exhibited marked effects on stability of muscle tissue structures and slowed the damage caused to the myofibrils by large ice crystals. The ice-growth inhibition activities might play an important role in cryoprotective effects of saccharides on frozen muscle tissue. Furthermore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations proved that saccharides were generally close to the ice interface and embedded in ice layers via hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions. The saccharides-ice complex was partially destroyed, and some dislocation and disaggregation were observed around the saccharides molecules. Thus, the incorporated saccharides suppressed the growth of ice crystals, providing protection from freeze-induced damage. Here, the obtained structural details of the ice crystals interface affected by trehalose and alginate oligosaccharides were well in agreement with the histological (H&E staining) experimental results. These findings help better understand the ice-growth inhibition mechanisms of saccharides in frozen shrimp, and these two saccharides may be potentially used as ice-growth inhibitors in frozen seafood.

AB Previous work indicated that conformational changes of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) induced by dynamic high pressure microfluidization (DHPM) was related to the increase of antigenicity. In this study, beta-LG glycated with 1-kestose and combined with DHPM decreased the antigenicity of beta-LG. The antigenicity of control, beta-LG-kestose (0.1 MPa) and beta-LG-kestose (80 MPa) were 100, 79 and 42 mu g/mL respectively. The molecular weight of beta-LG conjugated to kestose increased from 18.4 to 19.6 kDa and its conformation scarcely changed. Conversely, combined with DHPM treatment (80 MPa), beta-LG conjugated to kestose formed two conjugates with molecular weight of 18.8 and 19.8 kDa, respectively. Furthermore, the unfolding of beta-LG as a result of the treatments is reflected by a decrease of intrinsic and synchronous fluorescence intensity and changes to the secondary structure. The conformational changes induced by DHPM and glycation treatments synergistically decrease the antigenicity of beta-LG due to more masked or disrupted epitopes.

AB Experimental evidence suggests that moderate consumption of wine has health promoting properties that have been mainly attributed to the wine polyphenol content. However, a systematic analysis of the major healthy molecules contained in wines has not been conducted yet. Our study explored the potential arsenal of beneficial molecules contained in wine from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. The experimental approach was based on chromatography and untargeted NMR spectroscopy. In addition to already known bioactive molecules, for the first time, xanthurenic acid and oleanic acid were identified in wine in relatively high concentrations. On account of their many biological activities, these two molecules widen the range of potential beneficial effects of wine and pave the way toward the evaluation of their still unexplored sensory properties.

AB This study aims to investigate the impact of ferulic acid pretreatment on the hardness of Chinese radish after cooking. Radish slices were immersed in ferulic acid solution and distilled water, respectively. The ferulic acid treated samples showed significantly higher hardness (p < 0.05) than the control samples after cooking, and could keep relatively more integrated cell wall structure after cooking at 100 degrees C for 30 min. Subsequently, we determined the cell wall fraction contents, sugar ratio and molecular weight distribution of different treated samples. Ferulic acid treated groups showed higher percentage of chelate-soluble fraction (CSF) and sugar ratio 1 than the control groups in both fresh and cooked samples. The CSF had two high molecular weight peaks at 7.7 min and 8.6 min, probably due to the cross-linking with ferulic acid. This research may provide an effective way to decrease the softening of thermally processed fruits and vegetables.

AB This study investigated effects of UV-B radiation and CaCl2 on the enhancement of carotenoid content in germinated corn kernels. UV-B radiation and CaCl2 treatments were effective for promoting both carotenoid content and antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the carotenoid content was greater when under the combined treatments of UV-B radiation and CaCl2. Activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were enhanced but malondialdehyde content was weakened by UV-B radiation plus CaCl2 compared to the UV-B radiation only. The mRNA expression of PSY, PDS, ZDS, LCYB, LCYE, BCH1, CYP97C genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway showed different patterns in UV-B radiation and CaCl2 treatments. This reveals that the UV-B radiation can increase carotenoid content and antioxidant enzyme activity. Moreover, CaCl2 can further improve carotenoid content and reduce photooxidative damage caused by UV-B radiation.

AB Moisture affects the combination of starch granules and fatty acids in deep-fat frying. In this study, high-amylose corn starch (HACS) and glutinous rice starch (GRS) with various water contents were fried in rapeseed oil at 170 degrees C for 7 min. The complex index (CI) of the GRS-lipid and HACS-lipid complexes improved as the moisture content increased from 6% to 40%; however, further increasing the water content from 40% to 60% led to a decrease in the CI. At a moisture content of 40%, the CI of the HACS-lipid complexes was higher than that of the GRS-lipid complexes. Fatty acid content analysis revealed that the total fatty acid content at different moisture contents in the HACS-lipid complexes was higher than that in the GRS-lipid complexes both before gelatinization and after enzyme hydrolysis. In addition, the total fatty acid content in the HACS-lipid complexes and GRS-lipid complexes at 40% moisture content was the highest among all the measured moisture contents. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that both the HACS and GRS granules lost their integrity after deep-fat frying, and no free lipid droplets were noted among the starch granules after defatting. Both Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy verified that HACS combined with lipids yielded a stronger lipid-binding capacity than that of GRS at a moisture content of 40%. The study results may be potentially useful in the deep-fat frying of starchy food to produce foods with lower fatty acid content.

AB We developed a technique that detects Al3+ in milk/bio-samples, and reversibly applied to recognize tetracycline (TC) in milk, enhancing the fluorescence intensity without interference from other cations (Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Sr2+, Mg2+, Fe3+, K+, Sm3+, Ag+, Na+, Ba2+, Cr3+, Zn2+ and Mn2+); the limit of detection (LOD) is found to be 0.00022 mM with r(2)=0.9439. The detection of Al3+ is tested in milk as well as in living cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Debaryomyces spp.) by TC or by its quantum dots. This is consistent with the molecular orbital, revealing that the lowering of the energy of HOMO (Highly Occupied Molecular Orbital) discourages the electron transfer from HOMO of fluorophore to HOMO of excited states of Al-complex that increases the fluorescent intensity. Interestingly, carbon dots (CDs) generated from TC also recognize Al3+ as its LOD is as low as to 0.00050 mM with r(2) of 0.9404.

AB The generation of pyrazines in model systems containing enzymatically hydrolyzed whey protein under dry heating conditions was studied. Pyrazines are important Maillard flavor compounds. Hydrolysates, obtained with different peptidases (pepsine, chymosine, thermolysin and a non-specific peptidase from Aspergillus melleus), contained a varying peptide profile and free amino acid content. The impact of each hydrolysate on the generation of flavor volatiles was measured by HS-SPME-GC/MS. The presence of oligopeptides had an enhancing role on the generation of pyrazines while, in contrast, free amino acids contributed to a lesser extent in pyrazine formation, except in the hydrolysate using the non-specific peptidase because of its high free amino acid content. Typically, 2,5(6)-dimethylpyrazine was the most abundant pyrazine found, although in the chymotripsine hydrolysate also other pyrazines were dominant. The hydrolysate obtained from the non-specific peptidase contained a larger variety of pyrazines, including the typical Strecker aldehydes originating from specific amino acids. This study demonstrates that oligopeptides are important Maillard flavor precursors.

AB Inulin can improve the nutritional quality of gluten free (GF) bread and have a prebiotic activity. However, breadmaking might frustrate the enrichments efforts due to inulin loss. In this study we aimed at studying the inulin enrichment of GF bread. Two different yeasts [having normal (Y1) or reduced (Y2) invertase activity] were used to leaven the breads enriched with five marketed inulins, which differed for the degree of polymerization (DP) and the manufacturer. Inulin replaced 10% of the rice flour and had low, intermediate or high DP, which ranged from 2 to 20; approximate to 20; >= 20, respectively. Fructan hydrolysis occurred during leavening of Y1-GF breads, reaching losses up to 40% after baking, depending on the diverse DP of the inulin-forming fructans. Inulin loss was less relevant in Y2-GF breads (up to 5% after baking) than Y1-GF breads. Crumb texture was not negatively influenced by inulin presence, even if this was high (e.g., Y2-GF breads). Information collected within this study may provide further insight to better optimize a GF bread formulation in view of inulin enrichment.

AB The effect of sodium para-aminosalicylate (PAS-Na) on litchi pericarp browning and the potential regulating mechanism was investigated in this study. Results showed that 0.3 g L-1 PAS-Na significantly inhibited the development of pericarp browning and reduced respiration rate of litchi fruit. PAS-Na inhibited the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the expression level of senescence-related genes. Additionally, PAS-Na treatment enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), which might contribute to the scavenging of ROS. Meanwhile, PAS-Na treatment maintained membrane integrity as indicated by reduced relative membrane leakage rate and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, as well as lower activities of membrane lipids-degrading enzymes: lipase and lipoxygenase (LOX). Amino acids, especially GABA, Glu, Met contents were also significantly affected by PAS-Na treatment. Taken together, we postulated that PAS-Na treatment might be a promising method for controlling postharvest browning and prolonging shelf-life of harvested litchi fruit.

AB To control starch digestion, debranched high amylose maize starch (dG50) was forced to re-assemble through hydrothermal treatment combined with lauric acid (LA) complexation under high pressure (dG50-LA-HP) and atmospheric pressure (dG50-LA-AP). Both dG50-LA-HP and dG50-LA-AP complexes showed B+V hybrid crystalline structures, but mainly V-type for dG50-LA-AP and apparently B+V-type for dG50-LA-HP. Besides, those two type complexes significantly decreased starch digestibility, and the dG50-LA-HP changed in a higher magnitude since dG50-LA-HP contained more compact and ordered aggregates. The different starch assembly behavior under synergistic effect of hydrothermal treatment and LA complexation combined with different pressure should be responsible for the variation in starch digestibility. The formation of B-type crystallite contributed to the increase of slowly digestible starch, whereas the type I and type II starch-LA inclusion complexes increased the resistant starch fractions. This study offers a novel understanding on starch reassembly under hydrothermal treatment and lipid complexation combined with different pressure.

AB Prickly pear peel is an agroindustrial by-product source of dietary fiber and bioactive compounds. Three tonalities of prickly pear cultivars: Cristalina (green), Seleccion 2-1-62 (yellow-orange) and Roja Lisa (red) were evaluated regarding their bioactive compounds and functional, rheological, and morphological properties. Phytochemical profile assessed by UPLC-ESI-QTOF MSE allowed the identification of 145 compounds: sixty-eight extractable polyphenols, fifteen hydrolysable polyphenols, forty-one betalains, sixteen carotenoids, and five phytosterols. Cristalina showed the highest amount of extractable polyphenols (ferulic and benzoic acid, kaempferol 3-O-glucoside), Cristalina and Seleccion of hydrolysable polyphenols (gallic acid 3-O-gallate, cinnamic acid, hesperidin, myricetin 3-O-rhamnoside). Betaxanthins, carotenoids, and phytosterols were detected in all cultivars, mainly in Roja Lisa. All cultivars showed acceptable hydration properties, which was related to their porosity. Seleccion showed the highest elastic (G') and lower viscous (G '') behavior. These results suggest that prickly pear peels can be used as functional ingredients rich in bioactive compounds.

AB Sodium salt reduction in cereal products has been one of the top health trends. During pasta-making, kansui (an alkaline salt with reduced sodium) was added at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% (total flour weight basis) to modify semolina gluten aggregation reactions in dough production and pasta cooking. Adding 1.0% kansui enhanced pasta dough elasticity and strength, but cooking quality was changed barely. These consequences may be attributed to more polymeric glutenin incorporated in the network through thiol (SH)/disulfide (SS) exchange or other non-redox reactions/interactions by introducing kansui, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, FTIR, and HPLC results. The protein cross-linking induced by kansui (1.0%) improved the texture properties of pasta without compromising the cooking and coloration characteristics. Considering the process convenience and food safety of reducing sodium chloride with natural alkaline salt reagent in industrial pasta production, this could be a potential approach for sodium reduction.

AB Shellfish consumption is an important pathway for coastal residents exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) and methylmercury (MeHg). An integrated method had been developed for simultaneous determination of iAs and MeHg in shellfish with microwave-assisted extraction and high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry identification. The limits of detection were 0.0520, 0.1003 and 0.0015 mg/kg (dry weight) for As-III, As-V and MeHg, respectively. The proposed method was applied to evaluate the contents and health risks of iAs and MeHg in shellfish from the typical coastal cities (Lianyungang and Yantai) in China. The concentrations of iAs and MeHg in fresh shellfish were 0.10-1.69 mg/kg and 0.46-6.38 mu g/kg, respectively. The target hazard quotient and target cancer risk values of iAs were the highest for the children and adults in Lianyungang, and were respectively larger than 1 and 1x10(-4), indicating both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of iAs exposure were significant in this area.

AB A novel monolithic column was prepared by in-situ free radical polymerization using N-methylolacrylamide (NMA) and N, N-diethylacrylamide (DEA) as co-monomers. The monolith was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and its nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm, and it was used as a solid phase extraction (SPE) absorbent for the online enrichment of beta-sitosterol by high performance liquid chromatography. The optimized method had good linearity, and the linear regression coefficient was 0.998. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.006 mg/mL and 0.02 mg/mL, respectively. The interday and intraday accuracies were less than 7.28%. The spiked recoveries of beta-sitosterol in the six plant oil were 90.96-103.56%. The maximum amount of beta-sitosterol adsorbed on the monolithic column was 12.69 mg/g, and the enrichment factor of beta-sitosterol was 78. The results showed that the monolith could be used as an online SPE absorbent for the determination of beta-sitosterol in plant oil samples.

AB The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the addition of huitlacoche paste to nixtamalized blue-corn flours (NBCF) on the physicochemical, thermal, and rheological properties of masas. Raw blue maize was nixtamalized (hydrothermal alkalinized process), then was wet-milled in a stone mill, masa was dehydrated, pulverized and sieved to obtain NBCF; commercial nixtamalized blue-corn flour (CNBCF) was used as a control. Huitlacoche paste in concentrations of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18% was added to nixtamalized flours. Characteristics of the blue grain showed its great effects on water absorption, viscosity, and masa cohesiveness; the addition of huitlacoche significantly influenced adhesiveness, water-absorption, color, and the rheological properties (p < 0.05). Values between 0.03 and 0.083 kg-force resulted in masas with optimal adhesiveness. The inclusion of huitlacoche paste can be achieved with a maximal addition of 9% in NBCF for an industrial process and could comprise a new industrialization alternative.

AB Polymeric procyanidins (PPCs) were the major constituents of procyanidins, while they have poor bioactivity. To better utilize PPCs, a semisynthetic approach for converting PPCs to oligomeric procyanidins (OPCs) was proposed. Grape seed PPCs were simultaneously reacted with catechin (C) and epicatechin (EC) under acid condition. Combining response surface methodology (RSM) and single-factor experiments, an optimized semisynthetic condition was confirmed with the ratio of PPCs with C and EC of 1: 1: 1, temperature of 40 degrees C, reaction time of 20 min and 0.1M methanolic HCl. High-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) was adopted to obtain three fractions from semisynthetic products and preparative-HPLC was used to isolate individual procyanidins. Thirteen B-type procyanidins including monomers, dimers and trimers were got with high yield of 0.8-17.8 mg from 200 mg semisynthetic products and high purity over 91%. The developed semisynthesis combined with separation method was efficient to obtain individual OPCs in preparative scale.

AB The nutrients, heavy metals and pesticide concentrations of an imported (Gold) and three locally produced and marketed rice varieties (Samples B-mass, C-R8 and D-CP) in Nigeria were investigated using standard techniques. All the rice varieties contained considerable amounts of moisture, ash, protein, lipid and carbohydrate but were low in crude fibre. The local rice varieties contained higher (P < 0.05) amounts of tryptophan and tyrosine than the imported rice. Sample C had the highest amino acids contents compared with other rice varieties. The threonine contents of the control and sample B were higher than WHO standards. Lead and mercury were not detected in all the rice varieties while the levels of cadmium, arsenic, chromium and thallium were within permissible range. The rice varieties contained considerable amounts of selenium, calcium, iron, manganese, zinc, phosphorous, boron, cobalt, Vitamins A, D, B6, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and cobalamin with insignificant amounts of pesticide residues.

AB The objective of this study was to compare the fatty acid and terpene profile of ovine and caprine milk from animals raised under a semi-extensive production system in commercial farms located in Northwest Greece. Regarding fatty acid profile, ovine milk had a higher percentage of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA(cis-9, trans-11)) as well as higher percentages of both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in relation to caprine milk. Terpene profile analysis showed a high frequency of appearance for a-pinene, d-limonene, beta-pinene in both types of milk. beta-Caryophyllene was detected in the majority of the examined ovine and caprine milk samples suggesting that its presence could be used as a potential biomarker of grass feeding. The relative frequency of appearance was higher in caprine milk for the majority of identified terpenes. Ovine milk had better nutritional value in comparison to caprine milk that had an enriched terpene profile than ovine milk.

AB To assess the risk posed by meat consumption to the Fiji and Pacific populace, the present study reports nitrate and nitrite in meat. Twelve commercially available meat products, with a total of 210 fresh and processed meat samples, were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by an optimised RP-HPLC technique with isocratic elution using n-octylamine in 20.0% methanol at pH 6.60. The nitrate content in the meat samples ranged from 0.00 to 124 mg kg(-1) whereas the nitrite ranged from 0.00 to 164 mg kg(-1). The study shows that the nitrate and nitrite contents of meat samples in Fiji were below the maximum level proposed by European Union legislation but above the limit set by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ). The estimated dietary intake of nitrate and nitrite was calculated from a 24-h diet recall study as well as from Fiji's food balance sheets.

AB Vineyard management can influence the growth and yield components in the vineyards and therefore on the grape and wine quality. In this work, a chemical study was conducted (2014-2015) to examine the effect of fertigation on chemical composition of Albarino. A control (Rain-fed) and fertigation (60% and 100%) treatments were apply at same irrigation depth, where fertigation 100% is complete nutrient requirements to Albarino trellis system in this location (Rias Baixas AOC, NW Spain).
   Results showed that non-volatile compounds of Albarino musts were not affected by fertigation treatments. However, the effect of fertigation treatments on the volatile composition was observed. Terpenes and C-13-nor-isoprenids were the most affected families of volatile compounds by fertigation treatments, where 60% fertigation exhibited the highest concentration, improving the wine aroma quality. Application of principal component analysis (PCA) showed a good separation of Albarino grape according to fertigation treatments and vintages.

AB Isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) was used to extract krill protein isolate (KPI). Due to krill endogenous proteases ISP-KPI barely forms gel which is a major hurdle in wide application of this tremendous protein source for direct human consumption. The objective was to improve gelation and elucidate interaction mechanism between kappa-carrageenan and KPI kappa-Carrageenan was added to KPI at 0.00, 0.75, 1.50, 2.25, and 3.00 g/150 g and heated at 90 degrees C for 15 min. Added' kappa-carrageenan improved texture of KPI gels. However, the level of addition had minimal effect. SDS-PAGE revealed severe proteolysis of KPI even during heating. Total and free sulfhydryl were not different, while surface hydrophobicity and water-holding-capacity slightly decreased and increased, respectively with added kappa-carrageenan. Fourier-transform-infrared-spectroscopy showed none-tominimal shift of beta-sheet and alpha-helical protein structure; while C-C and C-O stretching as well as C-H bending of kappa-carrageenan showed the greatest shift, indicating that kappa-carrageenan was mainly responsible for gel formation.

AB This paper focuses on the development of a simple, fast and reliable technique of sample preparation to be employed as part of potentiometric measurements of plant total antioxidant activity (AOA). Plant extracts and plant microsuspensions were analysed. The conditions for obtaining plant extracts were chosen: they exhibited the highest antioxidant activity at + 80 degrees C and extraction time 20 min. A higher degree of dispersion of the analysed samples was accompanied by an increase in AOA of extracts and microsuspensions. The micro-suspension enhanced effect results from the fact that antioxidants contained in both liquid and solid fractions are involved in the zone of a signal-generating reaction. The analysis of plant microsuspensions reduces the duration of AOA assessment. Comparison of the results of antioxidant activity of black and green tea microsuspensions with the results of the analysis of extracts prepared by a certified method showed no difference.

AB The effect of shortwave ultraviolet (UV-C) radiation on the quality, especially browning of fresh-cut lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) root in relation to enzymes and phenolic metabolism was investigated. Fresh-cut lotus roots were exposed to UV-C lamp (75 W) at a distance of 30 cm above the produce tray for 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 min, and then stored for 8 days at 4 degrees C. Results showed that UV-C treatments for 5 and 10 min exhibited significantly low browning degree, soluble quinone content and inactivation of polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activities, while other qualities including soluble solids content and hardness had no difference with other treatments. Prolonging treatment time had less effect on inhibiting the browning since a long time of UV-C radiation increased cell damage. In summary, UV-C treatment has the potential to maintain quality of fresh-cut lotus root.

AB Recently, there is a strong interest in incorporation of pea protein as a preferred alternative to animal protein into protein-fortified food. However, the utilization of pea protein as a food ingredient has been largely limited because of its poor functionality. The aim of this study was to understand if solid dispersion-based spray-drying processing could be applied to enhance the solubility and mitigate off-flavour in pea protein isolate (PPI). The influence of amorphous matrix carrier type (gum arabic and maltodextrin), and PPI to carrier ratio (90:10-60:40) on physical properties, solubility, and off-flavour profile of PPI was investigated. The results demonstrated the possible mechanism by which factors such as surface area/volume ratio, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interaction between PPI and carriers enhance PPI solubility. Meanwhile, beany flavours were mitigated through the unfolding of secondary structure of PPI by forming solid dispersions with gum arabic or maltodextrin during spray-drying.

AB Six novel peptides were separated from peanut protein isolate hydrolysate (PPIH) using ethanol precipitation and gel chromatography, and identified as DQR, NNP, EGF, EDG, TESSSE and RGENESEEEGAIVT by UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. On the basis of sensory results, all peptides were perceived umami with threshold values from 0.39 to 1.11 mM and had umami-enhancing abilities simultaneously with threshold values from 0.33 to 0.82 mM. RGENESEEEGAIVT was the first discovered tetradecapeptide with umami and umami-enhancing ability. The dose-response test revealed that umami-enhancing activities of identified peptides were different: TESSSE and RGENESEEEGAIVT imparted better umami intensity when equimolar monosodium glutamate (MSG) was added into 0.5 g/L MSG solution. Taste profile analyses of complex mixtures with/without synthetic peptides were determined by both electronic tongue and human panellists, suggesting that umami peptides influence multiple tastes and electronic tongue has the potential to replace sensory test to distinguish taste attributes of foods rich in peptides.

AB Oat is rich in a wide range of phytochemicals with various physico-chemical, colloidal and interfacial properties. These characteristics are likely to influence human lipid metabolism and the subsequent effect on health following oat consumption. The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of oat materials varying in complexity on the lipolysis process. The composition, structure and digestibility of different lipid systems (emulsions, oil bodies and oil enriched in phytosterols) were determined. The surface activities of phytosterols were examined using the pendant drop technique. Differences in lipid digestibility of the oat oil emulsions and the oil bodies were clearly seen. Also, the digestion of sunflower oil was reduced proportionally to the concentration of phytosterols present. This may be due to their interfacial properties as demonstrated by the pendant drop experiments. This work highlights the importance of considering the overall structure of the system studied and not only its composition.

AB Studies of 54 antioxidants revealed that 27 of them, mainly polyphenols, generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) when added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), other media used for culture of mammalian and yeast cells and phosphate-buffered saline. The most active antioxidants were: propyl gallate (PG), (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and quercetin (Q). Chelex treatment and iron chelators decreased H2O2 generation suggesting that transition metal ions catalyze antioxidant autoxidation and H2O2 production. Green tea also generated H2O2; tea prepared on tap water generated significantly more H2O2 than tea prepared on deionized water. Ascorbic acid decreased H2O2 production although it generated H2O2 itself, in the absence of other additives. Lemon added to the tea significantly reduced generation of H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide generated in the medium contributed to the cytotoxicity of PG, EGCG and Q to human prostate carcinoma DU-145 cells, since catalase increased the survival of the cells subjected to these compounds in vitro.

AB The fate of deoxynivalenol, deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, 3-and15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, alpha- and beta-zearalenol and fumonisins (fumonisin B-1 and fumonisin B-2) through mashing and wort boiling was studied. Three different mycotoxin contamination scenarios were considered. In almost all samples an increase in the level of mycotoxins in wort was observed during mashing followed by a decrease after just 30 min of the process, with levels remaining constant until the end of boiling. Deoxynivalenol and its metabolites were reduced to their initial level contained in the malt before mashing, or even lower, however in none of the samples they were completely eliminated. Zearalenone was not quantitated at the end of boiling, although there was a significant initial level of ZEN. beta-Zearalenol remained unaltered during the process. Fumonisins were reduced by between 50 and 100 per cent during mashing and boiling.

AB A novel method for the determination of pirimiphos-methyl (PMM) in maize grains by fluorescence spectroscopy and three-way calibration was developed. The formation of supramolecular complexes and their effect on the luminescence properties of PMM were studied. A solvent extraction step followed by solid phase extraction for sample clean-up was optimized. A chemometric approach consisting in PARAFAC as second-order data processing tool and piecewise direct standardization (PDS) for reducing the complexity of the calibration process was developed to overcome the matrix effect. This strategy allowed dealing with the matrix effect while reducing the number of samples to be processed and, consequently, the solvent consumption and the total analysis time. Finally, three-way calibration was applied to predict the PMM concentration in unknown samples. The mean recovery was 115% and the limits of detection and quantitation were in the order of the parts per trillion, i.e. 6 and 20 ng g(-1), respectively.

AB For the first time, this study describes a HS-GC-IMS strategy for analyzing non-targeted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) profiles to distinguish between virgin olive oils of different classification. Correlations among measured flavor characteristics and sensory attributes evaluated by a test panel were determined by applying unsupervised (PCA, HCA) and supervised (LDA, kNN and SVM) chemometric techniques. PCA and HCA were applied for natural clustering of the samples and LDA, kNN, and SVM methods were used to create predictive models for olive oil classification. Identification of 26 target compounds revealed which compounds are responsible for discrimination, and how their distribution correlates with the sensory evaluation. In the investigated samples, LDA, kNN, and SVM models correctly classified 83.3%, 73.8%, and 88.1% of the samples, respectively.
   This suggests that mathematical correlations of HS-GC-IMS 3D fingerprints with the sensory analysis may be appropriate for calculating a good predictive value to classify virgin olive oils.

AB To identify and quantify the content of nucleoside compounds in the New Zealand native edible mushroom Hericium sp., a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole detector mass method was developed and validated. Four nucleoside substitutes, namely cytidine, uridine, adenosine, and guanosine, were identified. Optimization was conducted to study the effect of extraction method type, solvent pH, and extraction time. The optimal conditions were obtained using ultrasonic treatment in water at pH 3.8 for 30 min. For chromatographic separation, a C-18 column was applied using 0.1% formic acid (pH 3.4) as the mobile phase with detection at 260 nm. The total concentration of the four nucleoside compounds was high, at 10.7 mg/g dry weight, indicating a potential benefit for human health. The excellent validation results based on selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness revealed the reliability of the newly developed analytical method, which could be applied routinely in research laboratories.

AB 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) is a popular yet highly unstable aroma compound, which limits its commercial use as a flavoring ingredient. The stability and application of spray-chilled paraffin-coated microcapsules of 2AP zinc chloride complex (2AP-ZnCl2) were investigated in this study. 2AP-ZnCl2 microcapsules (0.081% (w/w) 2AP loading) and unprotected 2AP-ZnCl2 complex were subjected to ambient storage at four different relative humidities (RH; similar to 0%, similar to 22.5%, similar to 43.2% and similar to 100%). The results showed that the microcapsules had significantly greater 2AP stability compared with the unprotected complex under all storage conditions studied. A flavor application study using instant rice was also performed to validate the potential effectiveness of using 2AP-ZnCl2 microcapsules as a flavoring agent. Full 2AP recovery was achieved after the cooking process, where the controlled release function of the microcapsules was clearly exhibited. The results demonstrated that microencapsulation of 2AP-ZnCl2 allows for more flexible handling/storage practices and has potential for application by the flavor industry.

AB This work describes a simple screening protocol for quantification of carbasalate calcium derived metabolites, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and salicylic acid (SA), in animal and aquatic food matrices using liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The analytes were extracted from porcine muscle, milk, egg, shrimp, eel, and flatfish using acetonitrile, with the addition of formic acid as well as trifluoroacetic acid, followed by liquid-liquid purification with saturated n-hexane. A reverse-phase analytical column was employed with a mobile phase comprising (A) 1 mM ammonium acetate in distilled water and (B) methanol to achieve the best chromatographic separation. Matrix-matched calibration curves (R-2 >= 0.9817) were constructed using six concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mu g/kg in porcine muscle, milk, egg, shrimp, eel, and flatfish matrices. The calculated limits of quantification (LOQ) were 10 and 7 mu g/kg, for ASA and SA, respectively. Recoveries of 67 to 102% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of <= 9.0% (intra-day and inter-day) were obtained for all matrices at four spiking concentrations (5, 10, 20, and 50 mu g/kg). The method was feasibly applied for monitoring market samples. In conclusion, the developed method is versatile, accurate, and precise for detecting and quantifying acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid residues in animal-derived foods meant for human consumption.

AB Tomato pulp is a useful source of antioxidants, which can be extracted by high hydrostatic pressure (HHPE). This study aimed to optimize the individual and interactive effect of operating high pressure and solvent polarity (solvent mixture) on yield extraction, flavonoid and lycopene content from tomato pulp (Solanum lycopersicum) by using response surface methodology (RSM). The results showed that the selected factors (high pressure and solvent mixture) have a significant influence on extraction yield, flavonoid and lycopene content. Extraction at 450 MPa and 60% hexane concentration in the solvent mixture was considered the optimal HHPE condition since it provided the maximum extraction yield (8.71%), flavonoid (21.52 +/- 0.09 mg QE/g FW) and lycopene content (2.01 +/- 0.09 mg QE/100 g FW). Therefore, HHPE could be a useful tool improve the extraction and release of potentially health-related compounds while providing information on the cumulative effect of solvent polarity and high-pressure extraction on antioxidant compounds of fruits.

AB Mushroom production and consumption is increasing, but high perishability still represents a major commercial drawback. Besides increasing the product shelf-life, conservation processes should be innocuous to consumers. Therefore, the effects of gamma and electron beam radiation on chemical and nutritional composition of fresh samples of Agaricus bisporus Portobello (a highly commercialized species) were assessed. Mushrooms were irradiated at 1, 2 or 5 kGy, and analyzed at different times (0, 4 and 8 days). In general, irradiation type had higher effect than irradiation dose. Gamma irradiation was associated with higher contents in sugars and ergosterol, while the 5 kGy dose, independently of irradiation source, was linked with higher protein levels. Nonetheless, irradiation might represent an effective preservation methodology for Portobello mushrooms, as it was effective in maintaining their chemical profiles (except for minor organic acids and saturated fatty acids) throughout the assayed time intervals.

AB This study analyzed the effect of pH (X1), temperature (X2) and inulin amount (X3) on transformation of isoflavones (daidzin and daidzein) to equol in soymilk fermented with Bifidobacterium spp. All responses significantly (p < 0.05) fitted into quadratic models with coefficients of determination (R2) close to 1 (0.935-0.989). At 24 h of fermentation, amounts of daidzin and daidzein were influenced by all factors. While at 48 h, all factors affected daidzin and only temperature affected daidzein. Equol production was influenced by pH and temperature in 24 h and by all factors in 48 h fermentation. The optimum conditions for equol production were pH 8, 30 degrees C and 0.5% inulin. Model validation demonstrated there was no significant (p > 0.05) difference between the experimental and predicted values, suggested the suitability of established models in explaining the daidzin and daidzein transformation to equol as a function of pH, temperature and inulin.

AB The effect of vacuum packing and ambient storage conditions on the stability of the beta-carotene in the transgenic Golden Rice (R) lines was studied. The beta-carotene was quantified using RP-HPLC at bimonthly intervals for a period of six months. The beta-carotene concentration in the genotypes analyzed ranged from 7.13 to 22.81 mu g/g of endosperm. The transgene being the same in all the genotypes, variation in the beta-carotene concentration reflects on the genetic background of the rice variety and the transgene position that governed the differential accumulation of beta-carotene. It was observed that in the absence of light, oxidative degradation is higher followed by thermal degradation. Weibull model with higher R-2 best explained the degradation kinetics of beta-carotene in Golden Rice (R) lines across all the storage conditions. The knowledge generated through this study can be utilized in devising an effective delivery system for Golden Rice (R) to the consumer.

AB A model system was established to investigate the effect of glycerol on stability of globular proteins. To study whether protective effect of glycerol is dependent on the nature of protein, four kinds of globular protein were used including a-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, native lactoferrin and lysozyme. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the thermal stability of the proteins with glycerol aqueous (0-80% v/v). The results showed that the stability of beta-lactoglobulin and lysozyme (hydrophobicity-dominated proteins) increased with glycerol concentration. However, that of alpha-lactalbumin and lactoferrin (metalloproteins), regardless of the ion-binding state, initially increased and then decreased. Different protective effects were observed beyond 50% (v/v) glycerol concentrations in liquid phase. The secondary structure and tryptophan exposure remained unchanged. In conclusion, the protection of glycerol on protein stability was highly dependent on the nature of proteins.

AB This study encompassed the lab-scale fermentation of cocoa beans in 300-g heaps under controlled laboratory conditions, in order to replicate the microbial dynamics and metabolomic changes that usually occur in large-scale spontaneous fermentations. Growth profiles of yeast and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) with the native assortment of microbes as well as with the use of a starter culture were very similar to those observed in literature. Greater production of acetic acid by AAB not only led to more acidic-tasting liquor but also contributed to bitterness, due to polyphenol preservation. It also brought about a drastic drop in pH leading to greater proteolytic activity. Peptides generated through proteolysis also showed incredible similarity to those reported in literature, in particular, those speculated to be involved in cocoa-specific flavour. A closer look at the naturally occurring peptide repertoires of our fermentation trials, generated by the breakdown of cocoa storage protein, pointed to a potential peptide responsible for cocoa-specific aroma.

AB Anisophyllea boehmii is an indigenous and wild species in Burundi. Its fruits are edible and commercialized in local markets. This study investigates chemical quality, composition and toxicity test of A. boehmii kernel oil from two sites in eastern Burundi. Results of the present study reveal A. boehmii kernels to be an oil-rich source, yielding up to 29% of oil. Fatty acid composition analysis classifies these oils as palmitic. In fact, the main fatty acids are palmitic acid (36.47-39.55%) and oleic acid (18.83-22.21%). The analysis of minor compounds shows high tocopherols (485-657 mg kg(-1)), phenols (82-135 mg kg(-1)) and beta-carotene (144-234 mg kg(-1)) content. The physicochemical parameters analyzed make A. boehmii kernel a source of good quality oil. Furthermore, acute oral toxicity test reveals no toxicity of A. boehmii kernel oil. Results of the present study are decisive in adoption of A. boehmii kernel oil as an alternative source of edible oil.

AB Antioxidant efficiency of thymol and carvacrol in walnut oil triacylglycerols (WO-TAGs) was investigated. WO-TAGs alone or fortified with thymol/carvacrol were emulsified with sodium caseinate-lactose mixture. Oxidative stability of freeze dried emulsions was assessed via Rancimat and accelerated oven tests. Bulk WO-TAGs with and without thymol/carvacrol were also tested for comparison. Higher induction periods (IPs) were recorded for encapsulated and antioxidant fortified WO-TAGs compared to non-encapsulated and non-fortified counterparts. IP of thymol included and encapsulated WO-TAGs were found to be 1.5-2 fold higher than that of carvacrol at all concentrations (0.05-0.20%). IP of WO-TAGs was increased dose-dependent manner in the case of thymol and the highest protection was obtained with 0.20% thymol concentration (p < 0.05). Peroxide formation in bulk WO-TAGs fortified with carvacrol showed a slightly higher oxidative stability compared to thymol after 24 d of storage whereas thymol was a bit more effective in encapsulated WO-TAGs.

AB The impact of the type of emulsifier used to formulate excipient emulsions on the degradation (D*) and bioaccessibility (B*) of beta-carotene in spinach was investigated using a simulated gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Emulsions stabilized by sodium caseinate (SC) were more prone to droplet aggregation than those stabilized by either Tween 20 or octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA)-modified starch. The fraction of beta-carotene available for absorption ( D* x B*) was also affected by emulsifier type: SC (12.0%) > Tween 20 (5.0%) approximate to OSA stabilized (2.6%) (p < 0.05). This effect was mainly attributed to differences in the digestive characteristics of the emulsifiers, which affected the transfer efficiency of beta-carotene from the plant tissues to the lipid phase, lipid digestion, and mixed micelle formation.

AB Bioactive peptides can provide health benefits due to different mechanisms. The aims of the present study are to produce bioactive peptides from bovine and goat milk subjected to the proteolytic activity of Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus flavipes enzymes, as well as to assess their putative antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. Bioactive peptides were successfully generated from proteases of fungi cultivated in solid-state fermentation. The generated peptides were effective against all tested bacteria and fungi. There was antioxidant activity, up to 92.5% DPPH reduction and ORAC stabilization at 52.5 mu mol mu L-1 of Trolox Equivalent. The generation of milk-specific sequences peptides in the samples was obtained through 2D-PAGE fractioning followed by mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Based on results in the present study, milk bioactive peptides presenting broad antimicrobial action and antioxidant activity spectra can be cost-effectively produced through solid-state fermentation. The herein addressed approach can be valuable for the pharmaceutical and food industries.

AB The efficacy of different buffers in extracting peanut from a solid model food incurred with peanut and subjected to processing was evaluated using two commercial ELISA kits: Veratox (R) for peanut allergen and peanut ELISA from Morinaga. Average percentage recoveries of peanut from unprocessed samples using the kit supplied buffers were 46 +/- 5 and 28 +/- 2 with the Veratox and Morinaga kits, respectively. However, Na2CO3, pH 9.6 and PBS containing 1M GuHCl recovered 65% +/- 4% and 77% +/- 10% of peanut, respectively from unprocessed samples with the Veratox kit. These two buffers also performed better than the Veratox buffer with fried, high pressure processed, and baked samples. PBS containing SDS and beta-ME, performed significantly better than the Morinaga buffer in recovering peanut from unprocessed, boiled and fried samples. Thus, the use of alternative extraction buffers provides better recovery of peanut residues from a processed solid food matrix.

AB Following the introduction of mandatory influenza vaccination for staff working in high risk clinical areas in 2018, we conducted active surveillance for adverse events following immunisation utilising an automated online survey to vaccine recipients at three and 42 days post immunisation. Most participants 2285 (92%) agreed to participate; 515 (32%) staff reported any symptom and eight (1.6%) sought medical attention. The odds of having a reaction decreased with age by approximately 2% per year. The system was acceptable to staff, and the data demonstrated rates of reported symptoms within expected rates for influenza vaccines from clinical trials. Rates of medical attendance were similar to previous surveillance. Participant centred real-time safety surveillance proved useful in this staff influenza vaccination context, providing reassurance with expected rates and profile of common adverse events following staff influenza vaccination.

AB Hematogenously disseminated candidiasis in humans is the third leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections in the US. There is no FDA approved antifungal vaccine or prophylactic/therapeutic antibody for use in humans. We first reported novel synthetic peptide and glycopeptide vaccines against Candida albicans cell surface epitopes that protect mice against disseminated candidiasis. We showed that antibodies specific for the peptide Fba (derived from C. albicans cell surface protein fructose bisphosphate aldolase) or for C albicans cell surface glycan epitope beta-1, 2-mannotriose [beta-(Man)(3)]) are both protective. This is an important step forward in vaccine design against disseminated candidiasis in humans. However, given the complexity of oligosaccharide synthesis, in this study we performed a new strategy for use of peptide mimotopes that structurally mimic the protective glycan epitope beta-(Man)(3) as surrogate immunogens that substitute for the glycan part of glycopeptide [beta-(Man)(3)-Fba] vaccine. All five selected mimotopes are immunogenic in mice and three mimotopes were able to induce protection in mice against disseminated candidiasis. Furthermore, immunization with three mimotope-peptide conjugate vaccines was also able to induce specific antibody responses, and importantly, protection against disseminated candidiasis in mice. Therefore, our new design of a mimotope-peptide based double epitope vaccine against candidiasis is a potential vaccine candidate that is economical to produce, highly efficacious and safe for use in humans.

AB Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific effector CD8(+) T cells are critical for viral clearance. To determine the effects of HBV-specific effector CD8(+) T cells on HBV infection, we performed a meta-analysis of the available literature.
   Methods: Electronic database searches identified appropriately designed studies that detected specific CD8(+) T cells in HBV-infected patients. Our main endpoints were the course of infection, seroconversion of HBV "e" antigen (HBeAg), the level of HBVDNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. We used a fixed/random model for analysis, according to the results of a heterogeneity test (P value of Q-squared, 12).
   Results: Our searches found five eligible articles. Pooled estimation of the reported results showed that levels of specific CD8(+) T cells were significantly higher in patients with acute hepatitis B than in patients with chronic hepatitis B (odds ratio [OR] = 76.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.37-378.70). With respect to chronic hepatitis B, patients with <10(7) copies/ml HBVDNA had higher levels of specific CD8(+) T cells relative to patients with >10(7) copies/ml HBVDNA, but the difference had no statistics significance (OR: 3.89, 95% CI: 0.71-21.33). Patients with negative HBeAg or positive anti-HBeAg antibody (anti-HBe) results had significantly higher levels of specific CD8(+) T cells versus patients with positive HBeAg results (OR: 5.82, 95% CI: 1.41-24.13). There were no significant associations between the levels of specific CD8(+) T cells and serum ALT activity (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.01-74.15).
   Conclusion: HBV-specific effector CD8(+) T cells influence the disease activity in HBV-infected patients in various ways and determine prognosis by eliminating the virus. Therefore, efforts of studying HBV-specific effector CD8(+) T cells focused vaccine are potentially needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: There were increased reports of fevers and febrile reactions in young children (particularly children aged <5 years) receiving the Seqirus/CSL Southern Hemisphere 2010 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3). Modifying the vaccine manufacturing process by increasing the minimum concentration of splitting agent (sodium taurodeoxycholate [TDOC]) from 0.5% w/v to 1.5% w/v for all strains resolved this issue. The current analysis compared fever rates in three pediatric studies of Seqirus IIV3 (S-IIV3) or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (S-IIV4), prepared using the modified manufacturing process, with fever rates in three pediatric studies of historical (pre-2010) IIV3 formulations. The historical IIV3 formulations, S-IIV3, and S-IIV4 had 0/3, 2/3, and 4/4 vaccine strains split at 1.5% TDOC, respectively.
   Methods: For each study, fever rates (any grade and severe) were determined for the following age subgroups (as applicable), using the fever intensity grading system used in the S-IIV3/S-IIV4 studies: 6 months to <3 years; 3 to <5 years; 5 to <9 years; and 9 to <18 years.
   Results: For each age subgroup, the any grade and severe fever rates were lower in the S-IIV3/S-IIV4 studies than in the historical IIV3 formulation studies, with the greatest differences in fever rates observed in the youngest age groups. In the 6 months to <3 years group, the any grade fever rate was 7.0% (severe fever: 2.5%) in one S-IIV4 study compared with 38.7% to 40.0% (severe fever: 9.6% to 17.8%) in the historical IIV3 formulation studies. In the 3 to <5 years subgroup, the any grade fever rate was 4.9% (severe fever: 1.2%) in one S-IIV4 study compared with 34.1% to 36.0% (severe fever: 6.3% to 16.5%) in the historical IIV3 formulation studies.
   Conclusion: This analysis provides clinical evidence that the modified manufacturing process improved the fever profile across all pediatric age groups, in particular, in children aged <5 years. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bivalent (Cervarix (R)) and quadrivalent (Gardasil (R)) Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines demonstrate remarkable efficacy against the targeted genotypes, HPV16 and HPV18, but also a degree of cross-protection against non-vaccine incorporated genotypes, HPV31 and HPV45. These outcomes seem to be supported by observations that the HPV vaccines induce high titer neutralizing antibodies against vaccine types and lower responses against non-vaccine types. Few data are available on the robustness of the immune response against non-vaccine types. We examined the durability of vaccine and non-vaccine antibody responses in a follow up of a head-to-head study of 12-15 year old girls initially randomized to receive three doses of Cervarix (R) or Gardasil (R) vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies against both vaccine and non-vaccine types remained detectable up to 7 years following initial vaccination and a mixed effects model was used to predict the decline in antibody titers over a 15 year period. The decline in vaccine and non-vaccine type neutralizing antibody titers over the study period was estimated to be 30% every 5-7 years, with Cervarix (R) antibody titers expected to remain 3-4 fold higher than Gardasil (R) antibody titers over the long term. The antibody decline rates in those with an initial response to non-vaccine types were similar to that of vaccine types and are predicted to remain detectable for many years. Empirical data on the breadth, magnitude, specificity and durability of the immune response elicited by the HPV vaccines contribute to improving the evidence base supporting this important public health intervention.

AB To gain insights into the current Japanese pertussis immunization schedule, we examined the distributions of antibody titers and avidities to pertussis toxin (PT) and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) in 460 Japanese healthy subjects (aged 1-60 years) based on age category. Our avidity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that young children aged 1-2 years, which corresponded to ages after receiving primary and/or booster pertussis vaccinations, had relatively high-avidity anti-PT IgG (mean avidity index [Al], 40.5%) compared with other age groups (Al, 26.5-31.9%); however, they had relatively low-avidity anti-FHA IgG (Al, 41.8%). In contrast, children aged 3-6 years had both low-avidity anti-PT IgG (Al, 26.5%) and low-avidity anti-FHA IgG (Al, 40.4%). A significant age-related difference in anti-PT IgG avidity was observed between children aged 1-2 years and 3-6 years (P < 0.05); however, the difference in anti-FHA IgG avidity was not significant. The anti-PT IgG avidity was positively correlated with the antibody titer, especially among children aged 1-15 years (r(s) = 0.508-0.685; P < 0.01), indicating that the avidity of vaccine-induced anti-PT IgG decreases with decreasing IgG antibody titer to PT. Our findings strongly suggest that vaccine-induced anti-PT IgG avidity rapidly wanes after vaccination, but this is not observed for anti-FHA IgG avidity. Because children aged 3-6 years have both low-quantity and low-quality antibodies against PT, an additional booster vaccination with acellular pertussis vaccines is required for such children in Japan.

AB Background: Influenza viruses (FLUV) are continuously evolving, which explain the occurrence of seasonal influenza epidemics and the need to review the vaccine strain composition annually. The aim is to describe the genetic diversity and clinical outcomes of FLUV detected at a tertiary university hospital in Barcelona (Spain) during the 2012-2016 seasons.
   Methods: The detection of FLUV from patients attended at the Emergency Department or admitted to the hospital was performed by either immunofluorescence or PCR-based assays. A specific real-time one-step multiplex RT-PCR was performed for influenza A (FLUAV) subtyping. The complete coding haemagglutinin domain 1 (HA1) and neuraminidase (NA) (2015-2016) protein sequences from a representative sampling were molecular characterised.
   Results: A total 1774 (66.1%) FLUAV and 910 (33.9%) influenza B (FLUBV) cases were laboratory-nfirmed. The hospitalisation rate was different between seasons, being the highest (81.4%) during the 2014-2015 season. FLUV were genetically close to vaccine strains except to the 2014-2015, in which most characterised A(H3N2) viruses belonged to a genetic group different from the vaccine strain. During the 2015-2016 season, B/Victoria-like viruses were the most predominant, but this component was not included in the trivalent vaccine used. Mutations D222G or D222N in HA1-domain were found in 3 A (H1N1)pdm09 strains from ICU-admitted cases. Three A(H1N1)pdm09 strains carried the NA H275Y (2) and S247N (1) mutations, respectively related to resistance or decreased susceptibility to oseltamivir.
   Conclusions: The circulation of drifted A(H3N2) strains during the 2014-2015 season was related to the high hospitalisation rate due to the mismatch with the vaccine strains. The predominance of a FLUBV lineage not included in the trivalent influenza vaccine during the 2015-2016 season highlights the need to use a tetravalent influenza vaccine. Virological surveillance of viral variants carrying protein changes that alter tropism and susceptibility to antivirals features should be strengthened in hospital settings. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A prospective, randomised, controlled observer-blind trial measuring the efficacy and immunogenicity of trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) and the immunogenicity of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) in pregnant women and their infants up to 6 months of age was conducted in Mali. Here we reported the immunogenicity of MCV, which was used as a comparator vaccine to TIV, in this population. Third-trimester pregnant Malian women were randomized to receive TIV or MCV. Blood samples were collected from women prior to vaccination, 28 days post-vaccination, at delivery and 3 and 6 months post-delivery and from infants at birth and 3 and 6 months of age. Meningococcal-specific serogroup (Men) A,C, Y and W-specific antibodies were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in a randomly selected subset of 50 mother-infant pairs where the mother had received MCV. At birth, 94.0% (47/50) of infants had MenA specific IgG levels >= 2 mu g/mL decreasing to 72.9% and 30.4% at 3 and 6 months of age. For MenC, 81.3% (39/48) of infants had MenC specific IgG levels >= 2 mu g/mL at birth decreasing to 29.4% and 17.8% at 3 and 6 months of age. For MenY, 89.6% (43/48) of infants had MenY specific IgG levels >= 2 mu g/mL at birth decreasing to 64.6% and 62.5% at 3 and 6 months of age. For MenW, 89.6% (43/48) of infants had MenW specific IgG levels >= 2 mu g/ml at birth decreasing to 62.5% and 41.7% at 3 and 6 months of age.
   Maternal immunization with MCV conveyed protective levels of IgG at birth through to 3 months of age in the majority of infants. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The ZOE-50 (NCT01165177) and ZOE-70 (NCT01165229) phase 3 clinical trials showed that the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was >= 90% efficacious in preventing herpes zoster in adults. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the safety data from these studies.
   Methods: Adults aged >= 50 (ZOE-50) and >= 70 (ZOE-70) years were randomly vaccinated with RZV or placebo. Safety analyses were performed on the pooled total vaccinated cohort, consisting of participants receiving at least one dose of RZV or placebo. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected for 7 and 30 days after each vaccination, respectively. Serious AEs (SAEs) were collected from the first vaccination until 12 months post-last dose. Fatal AEs, vaccination-related SAEs, and potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were collected during the entire study period.
   Results: Safety was evaluated in 14,645 RZV and 14,660 placebo recipients. More RZV than placebo recipients reported unsolicited AEs (50.5% versus 32.0%); the difference was driven by transient injection site and solicited systemic reactions that were generally seen in the first week post-vaccination. The occurrence of overall SAEs (RZV: 10.1%; Placebo: 10.4%), fatal AEs (RZV: 4.3%; Placebo: 4.6%), and pIMDs (RZV: 1.2%; Placebo: 1.4%) was balanced between groups. The occurrence of possible exacerbations of pIMDs was rare and similar between groups. Overall, except for the expected local and systemic symptoms, the safety results were comparable between the RZV and Placebo groups irrespective of participant age, gender, or race.
   Conclusions: No safety concerns arose, supporting the favorable benefit-risk profile of RZV. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: In many regions of the world, vaccine hesitancy has become an important concern to public health. A key part of any effective solution to it is to gain an in-depth understanding of the problem: its scope, who holds hesitant views and for which reasons.
   Methods: We adapt the original 10-item Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS), which targets parental attitudes, to a more generic version that captures general attitudes to vaccination. We use this adapted VHS in a sample of 1402 British citizens, selected from a large online panel (N > 1,000,000) based on quota for age, gender, educational attainment and region (response rate 43%). The existence of VHS subscales is evaluated via exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. We describe the extent of vaccine hesitancy in the sample, and use simple and multiple regression analysis to examine associations between respondent characteristics and vaccine hesitancy.
   Results: Despite ambiguities in defining hesitancy, we found that a substantial part of our sample held hesitant views about vaccination, particularly for those items reflecting aversion to risks of side effects. Four percent responded in a hesitant way to all ten items and ninety to at least one of the ten items. In line with recent studies in other populations, we identified two subscales within the VHS: lack of confidence in the need for vaccines and aversion to the risk of side effects. We found significant associations between hesitancy and various respondent characteristics but the predictive power of these associations remained limited.
   Conclusion: Our study suggests that whereas a substantial percentage of the British population is vaccine hesitant, these views are not clustered in typical demographic features. The small but important adaptation of the VHS to target general attitudes seems to result in highly similar psychometric characteristics as the original scale that exclusively targets parents. We provide suggestions for further validation of the VHS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Duration and functional aspects of the oral and systemic antibody responses following HPV vaccination in HIV-negative (HIV-) and HIV-positive (HIV+) men are not well characterized. Oral and systemic HPV-16 and HPV-18-specific antibody levels were evaluated over 18-months of follow-up, in HIV+ and HIV- men. Sera and oral gargles from 147 HIV- men, ages 27-45 and 75 HIV+ men, ages 22-61, who received 3-doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine were tested for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies at Day 1, Month 7 (1 month post-dose 3), and Month 18 (12 months post-dose 3) and HPV avidity (Day 1, and Month 7) using L1-VLP ELISA.
   All individuals seroconverted, regardless of HIV-status, following 3-doses of vaccine for HPV-16 and HPV-18. Serum HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody geometric mean levels were >2-fold lower in HIV+ compared to HIV- men at Month 7 (HPV-16: 808.5 versus 2119.8 EU/mL, and HPV-18: 285.8 versus 611.6 EU/mL, p < 0.001) but not significantly different at Month 18 (HPV-16: 281.8 versus 359.7 EU/mL, p = 0.145, and HPV-18: 120.2 versus 93.4 EU/mL, p = 0.372). Post-vaccination, only oral HPV-16 antibody levels at Month 7 were significantly different between HIV+ and HIV- men (127.7 versus 177.1 EU/mg of IgG, p = 0.008). Among baseline HPV-seronegative men, circulating levels of HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies were up to >3 fold lower in HIV+ men, at Months 7 and 18. In contrast, levels of HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies after vaccination were not inferior in baseline HPV-seropositive, HIV+ men. HPV-16 and HPV-18 avidity was lower among HIV+ compared to HIV- men at Month 7 (HPV-16: 1.95 M versus 2.12 M, p = 0.027; HPV-18: 1.50 M versus 1.72 M, p < 0.001).
   Although differences in peak antibody levels were observed between HIV+ and HIV- men following 3 doses of vaccine, plateau antibody levels were overall comparable, and avidity was relatively high for both groups. These data indicate that the vaccine induced antibody affinity maturation in both HIV+ and HIV- men and will likely result in long-term protective immune responses.

TI Seasonal gaps in measles vaccination coverage in Madagascar
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Vaccination; Measles; Madagascar; Healthcare access
ID HEALTH-CARE; BARRIERS; IMPACT; CAMPAIGNS
AB Introduction: Measles elimination depends on the successful deployment of measles containing vaccine. Vaccination programs often depend on a combination of routine and non-routine services, including supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) and vaccination weeks (VWs), that both aim to vaccinate all eligible children regardless of vaccination history or natural infection. Madagascar has used a combination of these activities to improve measles coverage. However, ongoing massive measles outbreak suggests that the country was in a "honeymoon" period and that coverage achieved needs to be re-evaluated. Although healthcare access is expected to vary seasonally in low resources settings, little evidence exists to quantify temporal fluctuations in routine vaccination, and interactions with other immunization activities.
   Methods: We used three data sources: national administrative data on measles vaccine delivery from 2013 to 2016, digitized vaccination cards from 49 health centers in 6 health districts, and a survey of health workers. Data were analyzed using linear regressions, analysis of variance, and t-tests.
   Findings: From 2013 to 2016, the footprint of SIAs and VWs is apparent, with more doses distributed during the relevant timeframes. Routine vaccination decreases in subsequent months, suggesting that additional activities may be interfering with routine services. The majority of missed vaccination opportunities occur during the rainy season. Health facility organization and shortage of vaccine contributed to vaccination gaps. Children born in June were the least likely to be vaccinated on time.
   Discussion: Evidence that routine vaccination coverage varies over the year and is diminished by other activities suggests that maintaining routine vaccination during SlAs and VWs is a key direction for strengthening immunization programs, ensuring population immunity and avoiding future outbreaks.

   PREDICTORS
AB Background: Pregnant women are at increased risk of hospitalization, serious complications, poor pregnancy outcomes, and mortality from influenza. Prior research suggests that there are racial/ethnic disparities in vaccination coverage and that a healthcare provider vaccination recommendation is associated with significantly higher vaccine uptake than without such a recommendation. The purpose of this study is to examine racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare providers' recommendations for pregnant women to receive the influenza vaccine and in vaccine uptake.
   Methods: This cross-sectional population-based study analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) during 2012-2015 (n = 130161). Both healthcare provider recommendation and vaccine uptake were assessed dichotomously. Logistic regression was conducted to ascertain adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, controlling for maternal age, marital status, education, prenatal care utilization, and smoking status.
   Results: Influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy ranged from 39.1% among non-Hispanic (NH) Black women to 55.4% among NH Asian women. In the adjusted analysis, NH Black and NH Asian women had 19% (95% CI 0.75-0.86) and 34% (95% CI 0.61-0.72) decreased odds of receiving a provider recommendation for influenza vaccine during pregnancy, respectively, compared to NH White women. For influenza vaccine uptake, NH Black women were 30% less likely (95% CI 0.65-0.74) to receive influenza vaccine during pregnancy compared to NH White women.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there are racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare provider recommendation and influenza vaccine uptake among pregnant women in the United States. Targeted efforts toward providers and interventions focusing on pregnant women may be warranted to reduce the disparity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a commercial lipase derived from Candida cylindracea was chemically modified with dextran by conjugating epsilon-amine in the lysine residue with the carbonyl residue in oxidized dextran using the borane-pyridine complex as a reducing agent to increase the hydrophilicity of the microenvironment around the lipase in the presence of organic solvents. The degree of modification (53.2%), amount of dextran (0.66 g/g-lipase), specific activity (similar to that of the unmodified lipase), and stability in the presence of ethanol and 2-propanol (the half-lives were 2.24 and 1.86 times longer than those of the unmodified lipase) were higher for the lipase modified at pH 8.0 than for the lipases modified at other pH levels. Following modification with dextran at pH 8.0, the stability of the modified lipase was higher than that of the unmodified lipase in the presence of 25% (v/v) DMSO, ethanol, 2-propanol, toluene, n-hexane, and isooctane (the half-lives were 1.45, 2.24, 1.86, 1.76, 2.67 and 2.95 times longer than those of the unmodified lipase). Therefore, chemical modification with polysaccharides such as dextran using the borane-pyridine complex as a reducing agent could be a promising approach for improving the organic solvent stability of enzymes.

AB Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is used as a sweetener in food and confections. Industrially, xylitol is manufactured by chemical hydrogenation of D-xylose, which requires expensive separation and purification steps as well as high pressure and temperature. The microbial production of xylitol has been examined as an alternative to the chemical process. In this study, a xylitol over-producing strain is breeded by mutagenesis of a newly isolated yeast Candida tropicalis with a new mutation breeding system named atmospheric and room temperature plasma. The highest yield strain T31 was screened among more than 200 mutants with a xylitol yield of 0.61 g/g, which represents a yield increase of 22%. Furthermore, a two-stage dissolved oxygen supply strategy was used in a fermentation process resulting the maximum xylitol yield 0.79 g/g, which makes it a promising candidate for xylitol production. Further biochemical analysis indicating the relative gene expression and the enzyme activity of xylose reductase were higher in mutants than those in the original strain, which partly explained the high yield of xylitol. Thus, this study provides a new strategy to breed the over-producing strains for the xylitol industry.

AB Carbon nanomaterials, include carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets, have drawn an increasing amount of attention because of their potential applications in daily life or in providing novel therapeutic possibilities for treating diseases. However, the overall biocompatibility, the potential toxic effects of carbon nanomaterials toward human cells, and their modulations in cellular mechanism, are not fully understood. Herein, four types of carbon nanomaterials, include long and short carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets, at low and high concentrations, were functionalized and dispersed in the biocompatible buffer for assessment. The surface structure, the morphology, and chemical composition of carbon nanomaterials were characterized. Also, biological assays investigating cellular viability, vitality, cell cycle, and apoptotic cell death were applied on cells co-incubated with nanomaterials, to evaluate the biocompatibility of these nanomaterials in human cells. Our data suggested that even though co-incubation of nanomaterials did not seem to affect the viability of cells notably, high concentrations (50 ug/ml) of SW could lead to unhealthy cells, and we observed dramatic G2 arrest effect mediated by p21 induction in high SW incubated cells. Other nanomaterials at high concentration may also alter cell cycle profile of the cells. In summary, our data demonstrated that these nanomaterials could regulate cell cycle and lead to apoptosis at high concentrations, and the underling molecular mechanisms have been addressed. Caution should be taken on their concentration when nanomaterials are in used in future medical applications.

AB In previous studies of Lactococcus lactis, the levels of proteins secreted using heterologous signal peptides were observed to be lower than those obtained using the signal peptide from Usp45, the major secreted lactococcal protein. In this study, G1 (the native signal peptide of CGTase) and the signal peptide M5 (mutant of the G1 signal peptide) were introduced into L. lactis to investigate the effect of signal peptides on lactococcal protein secretion to improve secretion efficiency. The effectiveness of these signal peptides were compared to the Usp45 signal peptide. The highest secretion levels were obtained using the G1 signal peptide. Sequence analysis of signal peptide amino acids revealed that a basic N-terminal signal peptide is not absolutely required for efficient protein export in L. lactis. Moreover, the introduction of a helix-breaking residue in the H-region of the M5 signal peptide caused a reduction in the signal peptide hydrophobicity and decreased protein secretion. In addition, the optimization of cultivation conditions for recombinant G1-CGTase production via response surface methodology (RSM) showed that CGTase activity increased approximately 2.92-fold from 5.01 to 16.89 U/ml compared to the unoptimized conditions.

AB Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most widely used mammalian host for industrial-scale production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other protein biologics. Isolation of rare high-producing CHO cell lines from heterogeneous populations of stable transfectants is a daunting task and delays the process of manufacturing of novel biologics. A variety of factors that contribute to the low frequency of high-producing clones have been described; however, the impact of metabolic burden and other stresses (eg. ER stress) associated with sustained high-level expression of recombinant protein (r-protein) during selection of stable transfectants has not been fully appreciated. CHO cell line development has not traditionally received much optimization in this area because the vast majority of platforms use constitutive expression systems to produce biologics. Previously, we developed a cell line (CHOBRI/rcTA) containing a robust inducible expression system, based on the cumate gene switch, that allows r-protein expression to be down-regulated during selection. Using this switch, we generated inducible CHOBRI/rcTA pools expressing an Fc-fusion protein within two weeks of transfection with volumetric productivity of up to 1.1 g/L at 17 days post-induction in a fed-batch culture process. Herein, we show that the ability to regulate r-protein expression during pool generation confers a substantial advantage for selecting high-producing stable clones. Reducing expression levels ("off-state") during pool selection dramatically enhances high-producer frequency compared to a pool in which expression was maintained at a high level during selection ("on-state", mimicking a constitutive expression system). Overexpression of the r-protein during the pool selection process negatively affects pool recovery and is associated with subtle but significant increases in BiP expression and cell death compared to pool selection in the "off-state". Our data shows that the cumate gene switch is a valuable platform for stable clone generation and supports the wider application of inducible systems for scalable production of biologics in CHO cells.

AB The biological conversion of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars is a key process for the sustainable production of biofuels from plant biomass. Polysaccharides in plant feedstock can be valorized using thermostable mixtures of enzymes that degrade the cell walls, thus avoiding harmful and expensive pre-treatments. (Hyper) thermophilic bacteria of the phylum Thermotogae provide a rich source of enzymes for such industrial applications. Here we selected T. neapolitana as a source of hyperthermophilic hemicellulases for the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. Two genes encoding putative hemicellulases were cloned from T. neapolitana genomic DNA and expressed in Escherichia coli. Further characterization revealed that the genes encoded an endo-1,4-ss galactanase and an a-L-arabinofuranosidase with optimal temperatures of (similar to)90 degrees C and high turnover numbers during catalysis (kcat values of (similar to)177 and (similar to)133 s(-1), respectively, on soluble substrates). These enzymes were combined with three additional T. neapolitana hyperthermophilic hemicellulases -endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (XynA), endo-1,4-beta-mannanase (ManB/Man5A) and beta-glucosidase (GghA) -to form a highly thermostable hemicellulolytic blend. The treatment of barley straw and corn bran with this enzymatic cocktail resulted in the solubilization of multiple hemicelluloses and boosted the yield of fermentable sugars by up to 65% when the complex substrates were further degraded by cellulases.

AB Microbial contamination in mammalian cell cultures causing rejected batches is costly and highly unwanted. Most methods for detecting a contamination are time-consuming and require extensive off-line sampling. To circumvent these efforts and provide a more convenient alternative, we used an online in situ microscope to estimate the cell diameter of the cellular species in the culture to distinguish mammalian cells from microbial cells depending on their size. A warning system was set up to alert the operator if microbial cells were present in the culture. Hybridoma cells were cultured and infected with either Candida utilis or Pichia stipitis as contaminant. The warning system could successfully detect the introduced contamination and alert the operator. The results suggest that in situ microscopy could be used as an efficient online tool for early detection of contaminations in cell cultures.

AB This work presents the comparative biodegradation of all chlorinated phenolic compounds by the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus and determines the microalgal bioenergetic strategy. The microalga manages its energy reserves rationally by investing them, either on growth or on the biodegradation of the toxic compound. The microalga seems to follow two distinct detoxification strategies. In the first one, when microalgae are surrounded by relatively low toxic phenolic compounds (phenol, monochlorophenols, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,6-dichlorophenol), they use all, or at least more of their energy reserves to increase the biomass production and not the biodegradation. In the second one, when surrounded by higher toxic chlorophenols (meta-substituted dichlorophenols, trichlorophenols, tetrachlorophenols and pentachlorophenol) the microalgae invest more, or all of their energy reserves directly in the biodegradation of the toxic compounds, while less or no energy is invested in biomass increase. The microalga biodegraded in five days approximately 9% of the lower toxic phenol and 90% of the higher toxic pentachlorophenol. Considering our ability to interfere with microalgae energy reserves, which define their stress tolerance in the toxic environment, and knowing the microalgal bioenergetic strategy, we could easily use microalgae to biodegrade toxic wastes in the frame of a rational biotechnological approach in the near future.

DE TALE; DNA scaffold; Pathway enhancement; Mevalonate-producing pathway
AB Synthetic scaffold systems, which exhibit enzyme clustering effect, have been considered as an important parallel approach for metabolic flux control and pathway enhancement. Here, we described an improved DNA-based scaffold system for synthetic tri-enzymatic pathway in Escherichia coli. With plasmid DNA serving as scaffold and exogenous enzymes fused with rationally designed transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), our approach successfully clustered three TALE-fused enzymes and significantly increased the production of a mevalonate-producing tri-enzymatic pathway with the optimized scaffold structure and plasmid copy number. These results further suggested the scalability and robustness of the TALE-based scaffold system, and we can assume that it can be used on numerous multi-enzyme metabolic pathways due to its programmable features.

AB The Gram-negative bacterium E. coli is the host of choice for the production of a multitude of recombinant proteins in industry. Generally, cultivation is easy, media are cheap and a high product titer can be obtained. However, harsh induction procedures using IPTG as inducer are often referred to cause stress reactions, leading to a phenomenon known as metabolic burden and expression of inclusion bodies. In this contribution, we present different strategies for determination of critical timepoints for product stability in an E. coli IB bioprocess. As non-controlled feeding during induction regularly led to undesired product loss, we applied physiological feeding control. We found that the feeding strategy has indeed high impact on IB productivity. However, high applied qs, C increased IB product titer, but subsequently stressed the cells and finally led to product degradation. Calculating the cumulated glycerol uptake of the cells during induction phase (dSn), we found an empirical value, which serves as a strong indicator for process performance and can be used as process analytical tool. We tested different approaches starting from offline control. Glycerol accumulation could be used as trigger to establish a model-based approach to predict titer and viable cell concentration for a model protein. This straight forward control and model-based approach is high beneficial for upstream development and for increasing stability.

AB Silkworms are an economically important insect. Silkworm pupae are also a nutrient-rich food and can be used as a pharmaceutical intermediate. The N-terminus of A beta includes 1-15 amino acid residues with a B cell surface antigen that is necessary to produce antibody and prevent the adverse reactions observed in response to the full A beta 42 peptide. In this study, we used silkworm pupae to develop a safer vaccine for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A beta 15 peptide was fused with the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and expressed in silkworm pupae. Then, we tested an oral vaccine with the peptide expressed by silkworm pupae in a transgenic mouse model of AD. The results show that anti-A beta antibodies were induced, A beta deposition in the brain decreased, the content of malondialdehyde was lower than in the other group, and memory and cognition of the mice improved. These results suggest that the high-nutrient CTB-A beta 15 silkworm pupa vaccine has a potential clinical application for the prevention of AD.

AB Fused deposition modeling by 3D-printing is a rapid technique for the production of personalized drug dosage forms. One of the most delicate step of the whole process is the drug loading onto the thermoplastic polymer to obtain the drug-loaded filament used as feedstock for 3D FDM printers. With the aim of improving the drug loading, a systematic study on the influence of polymer size distribution on the quantity of drug able to adhere onto the polymer surface was conducted. Several solid mixtures were prepared, using five PVA batches (4000-5000 mu m 1000-2000 mu m, 600-1000 mu m, 250-600 mu m, < 250 mu m) and Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride as active compound in different ratios.
   Operative specifics and printer's parameters were tuned for an optimal print of drug-loaded filaments into the desired dosage forms, i.e. cylindrical printlets, fully characterized in terms of homogeneity, process efficiency, physical properties, drug content and release kinetics. The PVA particle size affected the polymer ability to form homogeneous mixture with the drug and the efficiency of the extrusion process. In particular, finest PVA batches showed better processability and reduced the drug loss during the drug/polymer mixing and the extrusion process. Drug-loaded filaments with different drug concentrations were successfully printed and the obtained printlets dissolution profiles were almost superimposable, taking an important step for the future application of 3D-printing manufacturing process to obtain personalized galenic formulations.

AB Curcumin (CUR) has gained increasing interest worldwide due to multiple biological activities. However, the therapeutic application remains limited because of its low aqueous solubility, intestinal metabolism and poor membrane permeability. In present study, an excipient-free CUR solid dispersion co-formed with piperine (PIP), the absorption enhancer involving metabolism-permeability, was successfully prepared by melting and quench cooling (co-amorphous CUR-PIP). The co-amorphous CUR-PIP exhibited superior performance in non-sink dissolution compared with crystalline and amorphous CUR, and showed physically stable at least 3 months, attributing to the strong molecular interactions between CUR and PIP as evaluated by FTIR spectra. Furthermore, the combination of PIP with CUR in the co-amorphous formulation could inhibit the glucuronidation of CUR, as exhibited in the in vitro assay of rat intestinal microsomes. The co-amorphous CUR-PIP would also exhibit higher gastrointestinal membrane permeability of CUR, as confirmed by P-app of CUR in Caco-2 model. After administration of co-amorphous CUR-PIP, the AUC of CUR significantly increased by 2.16- and 1.92-fold those in crystalline and amorphous CUR, respectively. This study demonstrates that the developed co-amorphous CUR-PIP can enhance the bioavailability of CUR by increasing its dissolution, inhibiting metabolic processes, and facilitating membrane permeability.

AB This article reports moxifloxacin (Mox)-loaded nanocomposite films (CSN) of chitosan and chemically reduced silver (Ag). The synthesis of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by specific surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks detected via UV-Visible spectroscopy at the wavelength range of 400-450 nm. The embedded Mox was chemically characterized and kinetically analyzed for in-vitro drug release and ex-vivo drug permeation through rat skin. The prepared films presented higher swelling ratio and lower tensile strength (TS) and better elongation at break (EB) than control formulation (pure chitosan film). All the prepared Mox-loaded, non-crosslinked formulations presented sustained release of drug up to 12 h while slow and prolonged drug release up to 36 h was observed in Mox-loaded crosslinked CSN films. Drug permeation studies indicated that the maximum cumulative amount of Mox permeated (%) among Mox-loaded, non-crosslinked CSN films was displayed by CSM1 (57.79%); while in case of Mox-loaded, crosslinked CSN films, the highest drug permeation was presented by CSM18 (62.87%) in 24 h. The antibacterial efficacy of the prepared films was tested in-vitro against S. aureus (ATCC # 6538), P. aeruginosa (ATCC # 9721) and two clinically isolated strains of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). CSN films presented excellent against the all the selected strains with antibacterial potential being highest against S. aureus. In summary, the promising antibacterial potential of the CSN films recommend its biomedical application for use in wound dressing.

AB The antidiabetic drug gliclazide (GLZ) has a slow absorption rate and a low bioavailability due to its poor solubility. GLZ is often prescribed along with an antihypertensive, as many diabetic patients have coexistent hypertension. Cocrystallization and coamorphization are attractive strategies to enhance dissolution rates and to reduce the number of medications a patient has to take. In this work the formation of cocrystals and coamorphous systems of GLZ with various antihypertensive drugs was studied, namely chlorothiazide (CTZ), hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ), indapamide (IND), triamterene (TRI) and nifedipine (NIF) as well as benzamidine (BZA) as a model for the amidine pharmacophore. TRI, IND and HTZ were found to form coamorphous systems with GLZ that are stable for at least six months at 22 +/- 2 degrees C and 56% relative humidity. Coamorphous GLZ-TRI is also stable in dissolution medium. Coamorphization of GLZ-TRI with 15% sodium taurocholate gave a viable coamorphous formulation with an enhanced dissolution rate. Comilling of GLZ with BZA and cocrystallization from solution gave the amorphous and crystalline salt, respectively and the X-ray structure is reported. During attempts to obtain X-ray suitable cocrystals crystals of Na(+)GLZ(+) and IND 0.5H(2)O were obtained. Redetermination of the published structure of IND 0.5H(2)O revealed a unit cell with the length of the a axis doubled, a different space group and no disorder. Liquid-assisted grinding of a 1:1 mixture of GLZ and IND indicated the transformation of IND to a new solid-state form, while GLZ remained unaltered. Milling- and heating-induced solid-state transformations of IND are discussed.

AB Oral Thin Film (OTF) is a newly emerging drug delivery system which has many benefits for patients. Although there has been some formulation of OTF products, these have mainly been as confectionary or dental health products. The most significant benefit of this dosage format will only be realised once more pharmaceutical products become available. Within this paper, OTF strips containing Diclofenac Sodium were prepared using the solvent casting method and then characterised to ensure the method could conform to acceptable levels of uniformity, the mean (SD) diclofenac sodium content was 25.43 (1.39) mg, range 22.84-27.44 mg. Bioburden was tested against coliforms, yeasts and moulds and all results were confirmed to be < 10 CFU/g, also similar dissolution profile when compared to a commercial product to ensure biowaiver. An acceptable level of uniformity of mass was produced. K-F titration was employed to reduce the water content of the strips and it was found to be acceptable, this represented a level of water which would not be viable for microbial growth. The technique employed here in the production of OTF resulted in high quality products and amenability to being up scaled. Furthermore, the characterisation method was also sufficient to assess the quality of the products and may be used for future analysis of OTF pharmaceuticals.

AB Nasal delivery offers many benefits over other conventional routes of delivery (e.g. oral or intravenous administration). Benefits include, among others, a fast onset of action, non-invasiveness and direct access to the central nervous system. The nasal cavity is not only limited to local application (e.g. rhinosinusitis) but can also provide direct access to other sites in the body (e.g. the central nervous system or systemic circulation). However, both the anatomy and the physiology of the nose impose their own limitations, such as a small volume for delivery or rapid mucociliary clearance. To meet nasal-specific criteria, the formulator has to complete a plethora of tests, in vitro and ex vivo, to assess the efficacy and tolerance of a new drug-delivery system. Moreover, depending on the desired therapeutic effect, the delivery of the drug should target a specific pathway that could potentially be achieved through a modified release of this drug. Therefore, this review focuses on specific techniques that should be performed when a nasal formulation is developed. The review covers both the tests recommended by regulatory agencies (e.g. the Food and Drug Administration) and other complementary experiments frequently performed in the field.

AB Two enveloped viral vectors, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus, and a non-enveloped viral vector, human adenovirus type 5, were encapsulated by spray drying to enhance thermal stability. Results with these candidates led to the hypothesis that stability performance of chosen excipients may be less virus-specific, as previously postulated in the literature, and more differentiated based on whether the virus has a lipid envelope. Spray dried samples were characterized for their thermal properties, RNA viability and in vitro viral activity after storage at 37 degrees C for up to 30 days or at 45 degrees C for up to 3 days. The enveloped viral vectors, as a group, were more thermally stable in trehalose while the non-enveloped viral vector showed higher activity with mannitol as the primary excipient in blends. Trehalose shows strong hydrogen bonds with the envelope's lipid membrane than the other carbohydrates, more effectively replacing water molecules while maintaining the fluidity of the membrane. Conversely, the small size of mannitol molecules was attributed to the more effective hydrogen bonding between water and the protein capsid of non-enveloped viral vectors. In all cases, a matrix with high glass transition temperature contributed to thermal stabilization through vitrification. This work suggests that carbohydrate stabilizer selection may be more dependent on the envelope rather than the specific viral vector, which, if universally true, will provide a guideline for future formulation development.

AB Chemotherapy frequently involves combination treatment protocols to maximize tumor cell killing. Unfortunately these intensive chemotherapeutic regimes, often show disappointing results due to the development of drug resistance and higher nonspecific toxicity on normal tissues. In cancer treatment, it is critically important to minimize toxicity while preserving efficacy. We have previously addressed this issue and proposed a nanoparticle-based combination therapy involving both a molecularly targeted therapy and chemotherapeutic agent for neutralizing antiapoptotic survivin (BIRC5) to potentiate the efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX). Although the particles exhibited strong anticancer effect on the lung carcinoma A549 and the cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, there were lower-level therapeutic outcomes on the colon carcinoma HCT-116, the leukemia Jurkat and the pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 cells. Since targeted therapies are one of the key approaches for overcoming drug resistance, tailoring the treatment of cancer cells with distinct characteristics is necessary to improve the therapeutic outcome of cancer therapy and to minimize potential pharmacokinetic interactions of drugs. In the light of this issue, this study examined whether a cascade therapy with low-dose DOX and survivin-targeted tailored nanoparticles is more effective at sensitizing HCT-116, Jurkat and MIA PaCa-2 cancer cells to DOX-chemotherapy than simultaneous combination therapy. The results demonstrated that the sequential therapy with the protocol comprising addition of the nanoparticles after incubation of cells with DOX clearly advanced the therapeutic outcome of related cancer cells, whereas the reverse protocol resulted in a reduction or delay in apoptosis, emphasizing the critical importance of formulating synergistic drug combinations in cancer therapy.

AB Drug-rich amorphous nanodroplets have great potential to improve intestinal absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. Spray-dried samples (SPDs) of glibenclamide (GLB) with hypromellose (HPMC) or hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMC-AS, grade AS-LF and AS-HF) were prepared to investigate how GLB-rich amorphous nanodroplets form during the dissolution of solid dispersions. The co-spray drying of AS-LF significantly enhanced GLB dissolution from the SPD, leading to the temporary formation of GLB-rich amorphous nanodroplets. However, the droplets gradually coarsened as AS-LF fails to inhibit coarsening. In contrast, the addition of HPMC to the SPD failed to aid GLB-rich amorphous nanodroplet formation during dissolution. The failure of formation of GLB-rich amorphous nanodroplet was caused by slow GLB dissolution, due to the poor controllability of the GLB dissolution by HPMC. The addition of AS-HF to the SPD produced amorphous GLB particles that contained a large amount of AS-HF during dissolution. Gel-like particles formed instead of GLB-rich amorphous nanodroplets. When the SPD containing AS-LF was dissolved in AS-HF solution, stably-dispersed GLB-rich amorphous nanodroplets were successfully formed owing to rapid GLB dissolution from the SPD containing AS-LF and strong coarsening inhibition by AS-HF. Formulation optimization considering both aqueous dissolution of the solid dispersion and the inhibition of nanodroplet coarsening achieved stably-dispersed drug-rich amorphous nanodroplets.

AB A colon targeted drug delivery system for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), consisting in budesonide loaded mesoporous silica microparticles functionalized with a selective azo-molecular gate (M-Bud), has been evaluated for in vivo efficacy. Experimental colitis in male Wistar rats was induced by rectal instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). M-Bud was orally administered to the rats as a suspension in water. Colon/body weight ratio, clinical activity score, and histological evaluation were used as inflammatory indices to measure the performance of the microparticles. The formulation was compared with a suspension prepared from the commercial drug Entocord (R). Statistical analyses of all scores indicate that the controlled release of budesonide in colon from M-Bud showed efficacy similar to that of Entocord in the healing of induced colitis in rats.

AB Combinational antibiotic formulations have emerged as an important strategy to combat antibiotic resistance. The main objective of this study was to examine effects of individual components on the antimicrobial activity, physico-chemical properties, aerosolization and dissolution of powder aerosol formulations when three synergistic drugs were co-spray dried. A ternary dry powder formulation consisting of meropenem (75.5 %w/w), colistin (15.1 %w/w) and rifampicin (9.4 %w/w) at the selected ratio was produced by spray drying. The ternary formulation was characterized for in-vitro antibacterial activity, physico-chemical properties, surface composition, aerosol performance and dissolution. All of the formulations demonstrated excellent aerosolization behavior achieving a fine particle fraction of > 70%, which was substantially higher than those for the Meropenem-SD and Colistin-Meropenem formulations. The results indicated that rifampicin controlled the surface morphology of the ternary and binary combination formulations resulting in the formation of highly corrugated particles. Advanced characterization of surface composition by XPS supported the hypothesis that rifampicin was enriched on the surface of the combination powder formulations. All spray-dried formulations were amorphous and absorbed substantial amount of water at the elevated humidity. Storage at the elevated humidity caused a substantial decline in aerosolization performance for the Meropenem-SD and Colistin-Meropenem, which was attributed to increased inter-particulate capillary forces or particle fusion. In contrast, the ternary combination and binary Meropenem-Rifampicin formulations showed no change in aerosol performance at the elevated storage humidity conditions; attributable to the enriched hydrophobicity of rifampicin on the particle surface that acted as a barrier against moisture condensation and particle fusion. Interestingly, in the ternary formulation rifampicin enrichment on the surface did not interfere with the dissolution of other two components (i.e. meropenem and colistin). Our study provides an insight on the impact of each component on the performance of co-spray dried combinational formulations.

AB KRAS is a small GTPase that regulates cell proliferation and survival. In tumors, the KRAS gene is mutated, and leading to unregulated tumor growth. Despite the recognized importance of KRAS in cancer, attempts to develop small molecule inhibitors have proved unsuccessful. An alternative strategy is gene silencing and the use of small nucleic acid sequences (e.g. siRNA, shRNA), has been reported to successfully downregulate KRAS. In this study we developed ternary nanocomplexes to deliver an anti-KRAS siRNA to colorectal cancer cells, exploiting the interaction of hyaluronic acid (HA) with CD44 as a means to achieve selective targeting of CD44-positive cancer cells. Two different polycations, poly(hexamethylene biguanide) and chitosan, were complexed with siRNA and coated with HA. Physico-chemical properties and stability of nanoparticles were characterized, including size, surface charge, and degree of siRNA protection. We demonstrate nanoparticle internalization (flow cytometry), siRNA cytosolic release (confocal microscopy) and KRAS silencing (RT-qPCR) in CD44(+)/KRAS(+) colorectal cancer cell line, HCT-116. Further we demonstrate that the uptake of HA-decorated nanoparticles in cancer cells is higher when co-cultured with fibroblasts.

AB In vitro dissolution testing is one of the most frequently used tests in pharmaceutical quality control, since evaluation of the drug release profile and estimation of the dosage form performance is enabled. However, for oral film preparations no standardized compendial dissolution method or specifications are available worldwide.
   Therefore, four different dissolution methods described in the literature, namely the basket method, the paddle and glass disc (PGD) method, the flow-through cell with adapted film sample holders produced via 3D printing (FTC + FH3D) and the "Punch and Filter" (PAF) method were chosen and their suitability to investigate oral films with different release properties was compared. For this purpose, oral films with immediate (ODFIR ) and prolonged theophylline release (ODFPR) as well as double layer films (ODFDL ) were produced and investigated.
   All produced ODFs disintegrated rapidly in 27-46 s and showed content uniformity with acceptance values between 7.3 and 11.3%. The FTC + FH3D and the PGD method showed increased discriminatory power and were suitable to investigate the integrity of the shielding layer of ODFDL as shown by linear prolonged release (mean dissolution time at 80% drug release (MDT80 ) of 366.8 and 217.1 min for FTC + FH3D and PGD method), which was not possible applying the basket and PAF method. These methods did not allow clear discrimination between ODFIR and ODFDL, since immediate release profiles with MDT80 values of 4.1 and 11.0 min for the basket method and 6.8 and 15.5 min for the PAF method were found for both, ODFIR and ODF(DL )respectively. The FTC + FH3D method provided high flexibility, which may be used to simulate gastrointestinal transit. The PAF method reflects physiological conditions of the oral cavity and enables mimicking the in vivo film application. These methods are particularly valuable for research and development purposes. Due to the simple and well standardized instrumental setup as well as high robustness, the basket and PGD method are particularly suitable for use in pharmaceutical quality control.

AB Synthetic unmethylated cytidine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) is an effective immune stimulant in chicken. To be effective CpG dosage requirement is high. High dosage increases cost of treatment and introduces toxicity. A delivery system using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) is utilized in this study to aid in lowering the effective dose of the immune stimulant. CpG ODNs were attached non-covalently in different ways to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). We assessed and selected an appropriate linking method of CpG ODN with MWCNT followed by cellular uptake studies to establish that MWCNT-conjugated CpG ODNs were delivered better than free CpG ODNs into the cell. It was observed that MWCNT-conjugated CpG ODNs were equally effective in priming the cells in vitro at 1000-fold less concentration than free CpG ODN. In vivo studies revealed that a significantly lower dose of CpG ODN, when given subcutaneously, was enough to protect chickens from a lethal challenge of bacteria. The mechanism of immune stimulation was examined by in vivo cell recruitment and in vitro cytokine production studies. MWCNT-conjugated CpG ODNs are significantly more efficacious and less toxic than free CpG ODN to qualify as a potential immune stimulant.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate how the carrier morphology affects the expression of blend states in adhesive mixtures as a function of surface coverage ratio (SCR) and to identify where transitions between the different states occur. Adhesive mixtures of five lactose carriers with varying contents of lactose fines, corresponding to blends with different SCR ranging from 0 to 6, were produced by low-shear mixing. The powder mechanics of the mixtures were characterized by bulk density, compressibility and permeability. The appearance of the carriers and blends was studied by scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The size and morphology of the carriers had a crucial impact on the evolution of the blend state, and affected the powder mechanical properties of the mixtures. It was found that smaller carriers with little or no surface irregularities were more sensitive to additions of fines resulting in self-agglomeration of fines at relatively low SCR values. On the contrary, carriers with irregular surface structures and larger sizes were able to reach higher SCR values before self-agglomeration of fines occurred. This could be attributed to an increased deagglomeration efficiency of irregular and larger carriers and to fines predominantly adhering to open pores.

AB The encapsulation of essential oil components into liposomes was demonstrated to improve their solubility and chemical stability. In this study, we investigated the effect of chemical structure, Henry's law constant (H-c), and aqueous solubility of essential oil components on their liposomal encapsulation. Estragole, eucalyptol, isoeugenol, pulegone, terpineol, and thymol were encapsulated in lipoid S100-liposomes using the ethanol injection method. The H-c values were determined. The incorporation in liposomes was more efficient (encapsulation efficiency > 90%) for the essential oil components exhibiting low aqueous solubility (estragole, isoeugenol, and pulegone). Moreover, efficient entrapment into vesicles (loading rate > 18%) was obtained for isoeugenol, terpineol, and thymol. This result suggests that the presence of a hydroxyl group in the structure and a low H-c value enhance the entrapment of essential oil components into liposomes. Furthermore, drug release rate from liposomes was controlled by the loading rate of essential oil components into liposomes, the size of particles, the location of essential oil components within the lipid bilayer, and the cholesterol incorporation rate of liposomes. Finally, considerable concentrations of isoeugenol, pulegone, terpineol, and thymol were retained in liposomes after 10 months with respect to the initial concentration.

AB Real-time process analytical technology (PAT) is proposed as an effective approach for monitoring the performance of a Wurster coater. The coater was used for coating of 0.78 mm pharmaceutical pellets. The coating solution consisted of Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose/Poly ethylene glycol. During the coating process, small amounts of pellets (similar to 2 g) were sampled at 10 min. intervals and the pressure fluctuations were recorded at the same time. The signals were analyzed using the wavelet transform (WT) and decomposed into different sub-signals. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to the energies of these sub-signals, whose outliers were eliminated using the Mahalanobis distance method. The reference coating thickness data were obtained via spectrophotometry during the coating process. The partial least squares (PLS) regression was incorporated with the PCA for the development of a model for prediction of the coating thickness. The PLS regression revealed that the pressure fluctuations can be used to evaluate the thickness with a good precision. This study demonstrated the applicability of pressure fluctuations for the prediction of the coating thickness. This method can be regarded as a new robust, fast and non-intrusive PAT approach for monitoring the coating process which can be easily used by engineers and practitioners.

AB Archaeosomes are liposomes composed of natural or synthetic archaeal lipids that can be used as adjuvants to induce strong long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against entrapped antigen. However, the entrapment efficiency of antigen within archaeosomes constituted using standard liposome forming methodology is often only 5-40%. In this study, we evaluated different formulation methods using a simple semisynthetic archaeal lipid (SLA, sulfated lactosyl archaeol) and two different antigens, ovalbumin (OVA) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Antigen was entrapped within archaeosomes using the conventional thin film hydration-rehydration method with or without removal of non-entrapped antigen, or pre-formed empty archaeosomes were simply admixed with an antigen solution. Physicochemical characteristics were determined (size distribution, zeta potential, vesicle morphology and lamellarity), as well as location of antigen relative to bilayer using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We demonstrate that antigen (OVA or HBsAg) formulated with SLA lipid adjuvants using all the different methodologies resulted in a strong antigen-specific immune response. Nevertheless, the advantage of using a drug substance process that comprises of simply admixing antigen with pre-formed empty archaeosomes, represents a simple, efficient and antigenic dose-sparing formulation for adjuvanting and delivering vaccine antigens.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of stability of hydrophobic ion pairs (HIPs) in gastrointestinal (GI) fluids on their release from self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS). HIPs of leuprolide (LEU), insulin (INS) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were formed using various mono- and di-carboxylate surfactants i.e. sodium deoxycholate (SDC), sodium dodecanoate (SDD), sodium stearoyl glutamate (SSG) and pamoic acid disodium salt (PAM). HIPs were evaluated regarding precipitation efficiency, log Pn-butanol/Water and dissociation behavior at various pH and ionic strength. Solubility studies of these HIPs were accomplished to identify suitable solvents for the formulation of SEDDS. Subsequently, HIPs were incorporated into SEDDS followed by characterization regarding zeta potential, stability and log D-SEDDS/release medium.( )Independent from the type of (poly) peptides, PAM showed most efficient HIP properties among tested surfactants. The highest encapsulation efficiency with PAM was achieved at molar ratios of 1:1 for LEU, 1:3 for INS and 1:50 for BSA and log Pn-butanol/water of HIPs were increased at least 2.5 units. Dissociation studies showed that LEU-PAM, INS-PAM, BSA-PAM complexes were dissociated within 6 h up to 25%, 60% and 85% in GI fluids, respectively. These HIPs were successfully incorporated into SEDDS exhibiting negative zeta potential and high stability for 4 h. Log D(SEDDS/release medium )of LEU-PAM, INS-PAM, BSA-PAM complexes were 2.4 +/- 0.7, 2.1 +/- 0.62 and 1.6 +/- 0.45, respectively. Findings of this study showed that stability of Hips has great impact on log D(SEDDS/release medium )and consequently on their release from SEDDS.

AB We employed a new dry coating process with mild-intensity vibration to prepare a 100-mu m-sized microparticle capable of prolonged release of a drug. To accomplish this without using a binder, a series of laboratory-made acrylic latexes with different glass transition temperatures (Tg) ranging from 30 degrees C to 80 degrees C were employed as coating agents, and the effects of Tg and powdering method of the coating agents on coating performance were investigated. The laboratory-made acrylic latexes were powdered by spray-drying (SD) or freeze-drying (FD). Diclofenac sodium (DS)-loaded ion-exchange-resin with particle size similar to 100 mu m was used as a core particle. The process utilized vibrations with amplitude of 0.5 mm and frequency of 90 Hz to form an ordered mixture composed of the core particles with the loosely-layered coating agents. Subsequently, the coating agents were fixed mechanically on the core particle by impaction of zirconia beads. The coating agents powdered by FD showed higher coating efficiencies than those powdered by SD, irrespective of the differences in Tg values. Among the coating agents powdered by FD, the particles coated at Tg = 60 degrees C exhibited the most prolonged drug-release, although the coating efficiency was not the highest. In our proposed process utilizing mild vibration, we demonstrated that adjusting the Tg of the coating agents is crucial to the formation of binder-free multiple coating layers for prolonged drug release.

AB Corona alternating current electrospinning (C-ACES), a scaled-up productivity electrospinning method was developed by combining the intense forces of the alternating electrostatic field and a sharp-edged spinneret design with increased free surface. C-ACES reached two orders of magnitude higher productivity (up to 1200 mL/h) than the classical single needle direct current electrospinning (DCES) without any alteration of fiber properties. Polyvinylpyrrolidone K90 (PVPK90), a water soluble high molecular weight nonionic polymer was processed for the first time with single needle alternating current electrospinning (ACES) and C-ACES in order to prepare fast dissolving amorphous solid dispersions of spironolactone (SPIR), a poorly water-soluble anti-hypertensive model drug. The limited spinnability of PVPK90 with AC high voltage could only be resolved by optimizing the solution conductivity with organophilic salts such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) demonstrating the importance of conductivity during ACES. The effects of varied solution properties (composition and conductivity) and scaling-up were investigated by SEM imaging. Solid state analyses revealed that SPIR was dispersed in an amorphous form in the fibrous mats. In vitro dissolution tests showed ultrafast drug release in case of the amorphous formulations even when prepared with scaled-up C-ACES. Besides the enhancement of conductivity SDS also prevents SPIR from precipitation from the dissolution media due to its solubilization ability.

TI Glabridin smartPearls - Silica selection, production, amorphous

ID PORE-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; SOLUBLE DRUGS; MELANOGENESIS
AB Glabridin, a compound in the root extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra, has been identified as an effective tyrosinase inhibitor. Applied on skin, melanin synthesis is inhibited, making glabridin an interesting candidate for skin whitening or for the treatment of age spots. However, main obstaclefor its practical use is its low dermal bioavailability, caused by its poor water solubility. In this work smartPearls technology was used to increase the glabridins water solubility. smartPearls consist of silica particles with mesopores in which actives can be loaded. By this, actives are stabilized in amorphous state and simultaneously finely distributed in nm-range. Both amorphization and nanoization are well known approaches to increase saturation solubilities. In smartPearls these approaches are combined. In the first step, glabridin smartPearls formulation was developed, screening systematically the suitability of 4 different silicas varying in their pore sizes (3, 6, 10, 17 nm). Also, most suited filling level of glabridin was determined (25, 50, 80% referred to total pore volume of respective silica). Silica loading was performed by the immersion-evaporation method, resulting in pores filled with glabridin from bottom to top. By light microscopy, dynamic scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction the sample with 6 nm pore size and filling levels of 25% and 50% have been verified to be completely amorphous. Highest physical storage stability of 7 months up to now was obtained for the 25% filled sample. In the next step, concept of increased saturation solubility for smartPearls was proven. Dissolution profiles were recorded in situ for glabridin smartPearls and compared to glabridin raw drug powder. Both saturation solubility and dissolution velocity were remarkably improved. The water solubility for example increased by a factor of more than 4. This makes glabridin smartPearls promising for creating skin products with improved dermal bioavailability.

AB While vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an acknowledged potent pro-angiogenic agent there is a need to deliver it at an appropriate concentration for several days to achieve angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to produce microspheres of biodegradable polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) tailored to achieve sustained release of VEGF at an appropriate concentration over seven days, avoiding excessive unregulated release of VEGF that has been associated with the formation of leaky blood vessels. Several formulations were examined to produce microspheres loaded with both human serum albumin (HSA) and VEGF to achieve release of VEGF between 3 and 10 ng per ml for seven days to match the therapeutic window desired for angiogenesis. In vitro experiments showed an increase in endothelial cell proliferation in response to microspheres bearing VEGF. Similarly, when microspheres containing VEGF were added to the chorionic membrane of fertilised chicken eggs, there was an increase in the development of blood vessels over seven days in response, which was significant for microspheres bearing VEGF and HSA, but not VEGF alone. There was an increase in both blood vessel density and branching - both signs of proangiogenic activity. Further, there was clearly migration of cells to the VEGF loaded microspheres. In summary, we describe the development of an injectable delivery vehicle to achieve spatiotemporal release of physiologically relevant levels of VEGF for several days and demonstrate the angiogenic response to this. We propose that such a treatment vehicle would be suitable for the treatment of ischemic tissue or wounds.

AB Nanomedicines are now considered as the new-generation medication in the current era mainly because of their features related to nano size. The efficacy of many drugs in their micro/macro formulations is shown to have poor bioavailability and pharmacokinetics after oral administration. To overcome this predicament, use of natural/synthetic biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have gained prominence in the field of nanomedicine for targeted drug delivery to improve biocompatibility, bioavailability, safety, enhanced permeability, better retention time and lower toxicity. For drug delivery, it is essential to have biodegradable nanoparticle formulations for safe and efficient transport and release of drug at the intended site. Moreover, depending on the target organ, a suitable biodegradable polymer can be selected as the drug-carrier for target specific as well as for sustained drug delivery. The aim of this review is to present the current status and scope of natural biodegradable polymers as well as some emerging polymers with special characteristics as suitable carriers for drug delivery applications. The most widely preferred preparation methods are discussed along with their characterization using different analytical techniques. Further, the review highlights significant features of methods developed using natural polymers for drug entrapment and release studies.

AB Very few studies have investigated the impact of raw material variability upon the granule critical quality attributes (CQAs) produced via twin-screw wet granulation (i.e., granule size distribution, density, flowability). In this study, the impact of the raw material variability of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in a high dose formulation on the twin-screw wet granulation process and on the resulting granule quality attributes was investigated. In a previous study ( stauffer et al., 2018), eight API batches were characterized to determine the API batch-to-batch variability. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to analyse the raw material property differences between the API batches and to determine the causes of the batch-to-batch variability. In current study, the three principal components from that PCA model were used as factors together with twinscrew granulation process parameters (i.e., screw speed and liquid-to-solid ratio) in a D-optimal screening design of experiments to understand the influence of these factors upon the granule CQAs. It was found that the API particle size distribution and related properties (e.g., density, agglomeration profile) were critical for the granule CQAs. In a next step, the significant factors from the screening design results were used to determine the design space of the twin-screw granulation process for the studied formulation via a D-optimal optimisation design, herewith controlling the risk of failure for the potential API raw material variability. The possibility to obtain suitable granule CQAs with a risk of failure of 1% for all API batches was demonstrated. It was thus possible to identify a combination of process parameters that can manage the API batch-to-batch variability leading to granules with pre-defined suitable CQAs.

AB A polymer-lipid hybrid nanocarrier was developed to encapsulate psoralen (PSO) to improve its water solubility and bioavailability. The effects of PSO-loaded polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PSO-PLNs) on breast cancer MCF-7 cells were investigated. PSO-PLNs were prepared through a nanoprecipitation method and were optimized by a central composite design-response surface methodology using particle size and entrapment efficiency as indices. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy analysis confirmed the physicochemical characterizations of PSO-PLNs, which had an average size of 93.44 +/- 2.39 nm and a zeta potential of -27.63 +/- 0.31 mV. In vitro drug release of PSO-PLNs was evaluated using dialysis and showed a delayed release compared with free PSO. The in vivo anticancer efficiency of PSO-PLNs was appreciated using a MCF-7 breast tumor model. Administration of PSO-PLNs showed similar antitumor efficacy but lower toxicity compared with doxorubicin. Our designed nanocarriers successfully optimized the pharmacokinetics of PSO via improved systemic delivery.

AB A capillary electrophoresis coupled to an inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry (CE/ICP-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of external and intra-liposomal sulfate in doxorubicin liposomal formulations. Ammonium sulfate is a critical component of liposomes, in the loading and maintenance of drug in the intra-liposomal space. Complete separation of external and intra-liposomal sulfate was achieved using CE with minimal liposome disruption. The current filtration technique induces intra-liposomal sulfate leakage during the separation as a result of rupture of liposomes. CE was coupled to a triple quadrupole ICP-MS detection method that allows direct quantification of intra-liposomal sulfate without the need of disintegration of liposomes. Three FDA-approved brand name and generic doxorubicin liposomal formulations were compared for total sulfate and external sulfate. In addition, batch-to-batch product quality consistency was analyzed by comparing the total sulfate and external sulfate for the brand name formulation. Slight variations were observed in total sulfate among the different formulations, and the total sulfate was consistent between different batches of brand name formulation. However, the external sulfate concentration was significantly different among all the tested doxorubicin liposomal formulations. Nevertheless, the interior sulfate is higher than the exterior sulfate concentration to keep the doxorubicin encapsulated by maintaining the ion gradient. This fast and direct sulfur analysis method could be potentially used to quantitative analyze liposomal formulation for quality control.

AB This study aimed to investigate the following factors affecting the cytotoxicity of Capmul (R) MCM (C8/10MD) in self-emulsified nanoemulsions (SENs): concentration, triglycerides, and droplet size, and how these factors influence permeability of lipid droplets. Two triglycerides (C8T and Cl 8T) and six formulations were used: SEN1(C18T:C8/10MD:Kolliphor (R) RH40 = 7:3:10, 257 nm), SEN2(C8T:C8/10MD:Kolliphor (R) RH40 = 1:1:2, 30 nm), SEN3(C18T:Kolliphor (R) RH40 = 1:4, 26 nm), SEN4(C8T:Kolliphor (R) RH40 = 1:4, 27 nm), SEN5(C8/ 10MD:Kolliphor (R) RH40 = 1:1, 120 nm) and SEN6(C8/10MD:Kolliphor (R) RH40 = 1:4, 15 nm). There was no cytotoxicity from SEN3-4 (5% preconcentrate), but there was concentration-dependent cytotoxicity from the SENs containing C8/10MD. The presence of triglycerides in SEN1-2 reduced the toxicity of C8/10MD as compared to SEN5-6. SEN2 and SEN6 showed higher toxicity than SEN1 and SENS, respectively, due to the smaller size. C-14-Triolein-loaded droplets from SEN1 (0.45-0.6% C8/10MD) and SEN2 (0.3-0.6% C8/10MD) could permeate across the MDCK monolayer, resulted in intact droplets and radioactivity in the receiver chamber. The TEER was reduced as the C8/10MD concentration increased, and not recovered after 24 h from SEN1 (0.6% C8/10MD) and SEN2 (0.45-0.6% C8/10MD), resulted in significantly higher (p < 0.05) permeability of C-14-mannitol and H-3-propranolol compared to the treatment by the medium. In conclusion, Capmul (R) MCM caused concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and permeation enhancement, which were reduced with the presence of triglycerides and increase in droplet size.

AB Naproxen (Npx) was utilized as an anionic drug and loaded in the deproteinized natural rubber (DPNR) films prepared by the UV irradiation. The in-vitro drug release-permeation from the DPNR films and through the pig skin was investigated under the effects of the plasticizer type and amount, silicone oil (Si) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), applied electric potential, and used conducive polyazulene as the drug encapsulation host. The drug release-permeation consisted of 2 successive periods: the pore formation period and release-permeation period. In the first period, the scaling exponent n(1) values were between 0.5 and 1 indicating the decreasing drug rate with time. In the second stage, the scaling exponent n(2) values were higher than 1 indicating the increasing drug rate with time. The Npx release-permeation amount increased with increasing amount of hydrophilic plasticizers. The efficiency of plasticizers on the Npx release-permeation amount was ranked as follows: DBP > Si. The Npx release-permeation amount was drastically enhanced from the applied electrical potential due to the electro-repulsive force between the negatively charged drug and the negatively charged electrode, and the presence of the Npx-doped conducive polyazulene. Other characteristics were also investigated in details namely the matrix morphology, and the pore formation during the two periods.

AB The introduction of prescription opioids with abuse-deterrent (AD) properties to the marketplace has created a need for new testing methodologies to evaluate the performance of potentially abuse-deterrent opioid products. Drug abusers may attempt to chew solid oral extended-release (ER) opioids prior to ingestion to bypass the ER mechanism of the formulation to achieve euphoria. In the present study, a chewing apparatus was utilized to develop an in vitro chewing method for Hysingla ER tablets, a prescription opioid with labeling describing abuse deterrence via the oral route when chewed. Simulated chewing of Hysingla resulted in initially faster drug release during chewing while subsequent dissolution testing demonstrated that the masticated tablets still maintained ER properties. The degree of mastication and corresponding drug release were influenced by the compression gap and the resulting chewing forces. Simulated chewing followed by dissolution testing with different strengths of Hysingla indicated similar AD performance across strengths. By contrast, an opioid product with labeling that does not describe abuse-deterrent properties showed lower resistance to chewing resulting in higher drug release. The results of the present study suggest that the chewing methodology evaluated in this work may provide a useful in vitro tool for the comparative evaluation of AD properties.

ID FORMULATION
AB Individualized medicine is relevant to ensure safe and efficient pharmacotherapy. It requires a suitable dosage form and a matching dosing device to enable flexible dosing serving the needs of individual dose requirements. For oral films no flexible dosing option is available until today. This study covers the development of a dosing device that enables flexible dosing of films within the pharmacopoeial requirements. The prototype was produced with the 3D-printing technique fused filament fabrication. The developed and produced prototype of the device was tested for the uniformity of doses according to Ph.Eur. 2.9.27 and 2.9.40. A ribbon as model film and an oral film with HPMC as polymer matrix met the specifications for both tests for three different lengths dispensed with the prototype of the dosing device (HPMC film: AV = 11.30 (1 cm), 12.04 (2 cm) and 10.19 (5 cm)). A second oral film with a polymer matrix from PVA and HPMC exceeded the threshold for the shortest piece of 1 cm (AV = 26.54) because of slight splintering during the cutting process, likely due to too little plasticizer in the formulation. A successful device development and a use within the specifications of the European Pharmacopoeia is demonstrated.

AB Hot melt extrusion (HME) has been used to prepare solid dispersions, especially molecularly dispersed amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) for solubility enhancement purposes. The energy generated by the extruder in the form of mechanical and thermal output enables the dispersion and dissolution of crystalline drugs in polymeric carriers. However, the impact of this thermal and mechanical energy on ASD systems remains unclear. We selected a model ASD system containing nifedipine (NIF) and polyvinylpyrrolidone vinyl acetate (PVP/VA 64) to investigate how different types of energy input affect the preparation and physical stability of ASDs. Formulations were prepared using a Leistritz Nano-16 extruder, and we varied the screw design, barrel temperature, screw speed, and feed rate to control the mechanical and thermal energy input. Specific mechanical energy (SME) was calculated to quantitate the mechanical energy input, and the thermal energy was estimated using barrel temperature. We find that both mechanical and thermal energy inputs affect the conversion of crystalline NIF into an amorphous form, and they also affect the level of mixing and the degree of homogeneity in NIF ASDs. However, for small size extruders (e.g., Leistritz Nano-16), thermal energy is more efficient than mechanical energy in preparing NIF ASDs that have better stability.

AB The brain as an important organ can be affected largely by aging, and the comprehensive transcriptional underpinnings of brain aging remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a high throughput RNA sequencing to evaluate the expression profiles of messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), micro RNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in porcine brain. We have identified 714 mRNAs, 38lncRNAs, 41miRNAs, and 148circRNAs were age-related genes in the porcine cerebral cortex. The lncRNAs, miRNAs and circRNAs have effect on the age of porcine brain due to the much changes of expression level as noncoding RNAs. The up-regulated genes were significantly enriched for stress response, reproductive regulatory process, immune response and metabolic process, and the down-regulated genes were related to neurologic function, stress response and signaling pathway. The synaptic transmission pathway may be the key role in aging of porcine brain that it was co-enriched for in both differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs. Moreover, some lncRNAs and their target genes were also differentially expressed during brain aging. We further assessed the multi-group cooperative control relationships and constructed circRNA-miRNA co-expression networks during brain aging. We also selected 2 mRNAs, 2 IncRNAs, 2 miRNAs, and 1 circRNAs to perform the q-PCR, and the expression patterns were highly consistent between the two methods confirming the high reproducibility and reliability of the gene expression profiling in our study. In conclusion, our findings will contribute to understand the transcriptional underpinnings of brain aging and provide a foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying brain aging.

AB The use of proteases in the last decade has been welcomed in livestock and poultry industries and has led to significant results such as improved feed conversion ratio, weight gain and increased growth performance. In the present study, isolation and identification of a novel alkaline protease from Iranian Bacillus species was performed in order to use in livestock feed. After primary isolation of bacteria from soil samples of rice fields and early detection of bacterial genus, the zymogram plate was performed for evaluation of production extracellular proteases. Of the 11 strains producing protease, one strain that produced more enzymes was selected to continue the work. Characterization of alkaline protease was done using specific enzyme assays. To confirm the genus of isolates as well as to identify the species close to, molecular analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence was done. After that, bioinformatics analysis carried out in NCBI database for searching bacterial alkaline proteases gene sequences. The primer designed based on gene homology of close species for extraction of alkaline protease gene. The results showed that the enzyme extract had the highest activity at pH 9.0 and 50 degrees C. The 16S rRNA gene sequence was submitted for the strain called Bacillus sp. RAM on the NCBI site. According to the results of the phylogenetic tree, the bacterium was belonged to Bacillus genus and Bacillus sp. RAM was close to Thuringiensis C405. The isolated alkaline protease gene successfully cloned in pET28a and transferred to the expression host E.coli BL21. The expression of the protease gene was evaluated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The induced recombinant cells expressed the protease and revealed molecular weight band of about 38 kDa. According to the enzyme properties, this alkaline protease can useful for application in animal industry.

AB Ajuba dysregulation has been reported in several human cancers. However, its expression patterns and biological roles in human gastric cancers have not yet been characterized. In the current study, we found that Ajuba protein was increased in gastric cancer tissues and in cell lines. High Ajuba expression positively correlated with the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine microarray data mining also suggested that Ajuba mRNA upregulation in gastric cancer tissues. We used SGC-7901 and NCI-N87 cell lines for Ajuba overexpression and siRNA knockdown respectively. MTT and colony formation assays indicated that Ajuba overexpression increased proliferation rate and colony formation ability while Ajuba siRNA inhibited proliferation rate and colony formation ability. AnnexinV and JC1 staining showed that Ajuba downregulated cisplatin induced apoptosis while it upregulated mitochondrial membrane potential. Ajuba overexpression also inhibited caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, while Ajuba depletion showed the opposite effects. Notably, Ajuba enhanced glucose metabolism by upregulating glucose uptake, glucose consumption, lactate production and ATP production. We further revealed that Ajuba positively regulated cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and GLUT1 at both mRNA and protein levels. Analysis of TCGA dataset revealed that there were positive correlations between Ajuba and cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, GLUT1 at the mRNA levels. Further investigation demonstrated that Ajuba overexpression inhibited Hippo signaling by upregulating YAP protein expression. Depletion of YAP by siRNA abolished the effect of Ajuba on cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and GLUT1. Together, our study showed that Ajuba was overexpressed in human gastric cancers, where it increased cell growth and chemoresistance. Our data also identified novel roles of Ajuba in gastric cancer progression involving regulating glucose uptake and mitochondrial function through the YAP-GLUT1/Bcl-xL axis, making it a potential therapeutic target.

AB In insects, olfaction plays a critical role in locating hosts, recognizing mates, and selecting oviposition sites. The Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis Motschulsky) feeds on 43 species of trees in 15 families, but its chemosensory mechanisms are poorly understood. Herein, genes encoding 61 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) were identified from the published genome and our previous A. glabripennis transcriptomic data. To investigate their physiological functions, we performed expression profiling of all AglaOBPs in the antennae, legs, and maxillary palps of both sexes. Phylogenetic analysis clustered A. glabripennis OBPs into four subgroups, comprising 29 Minus-C OBPs, 15 Antennae-binding proteins (ABPIIs), 10 Classic OBPs, and one Plus-C OBP. 12 AglaOBP genes were expressed specifically in antennae, and AglaOBP3, AglaOBP18, AglaOBP21, AglaOBP33, AglaOBP41, AglaOBP45, and AglaOBP47 were particularly highly expressed in male antennae. These proteins may function in the detection of female sex pheromones. AglaOBP23 and AglaOBP44 were preferentially expressed in maxillary palps. Expression profiling suggests that many OBPs may be involved in olfaction and gustation, in addition to carrying hydrophobic molecules. The AglaOBPs family has acquired functional diversity concurrently with functional constraints, and further investigation could provide insight into the roles of OBPs in chemoreception.

AB Whether plasma miRNAs could be used as novel non-invasive biomarkers in diagnosing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains unknown. In this study, we designed a four-phase study to identify differentially expressed plasma miRNAs in Chinese PTC patients. Exiqon panel was initially utilized to conduct plasma miRNA profile (3 PTC pools VS. 1 healthy control (HC) pool; each 10 samples were pooled as 1 sample). The dysregulated miRNAs were then analyzed in the training (30 PTC VS. 30 HCs), testing (57 PTC VS. 54 HCs) and external validation phases (33 PTC VS. 30HCs). The identified miRNAs were further affirmed in benign nodules (2 nodular goiter (NG) pool VS. 1 HC pool). We also verified the expression of identified miRNAs in 17 matched malignant and normal tissue samples, NG plasma samples (29 PTC VS. 29 NG) and plasma exosomes (25 PTC VS. 25 HCs). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the identified miRNAs. As a result, the screening phase demonstrated 30 dysregulated plasma miRNAs in PTC patients compared with HCs. After multiphase experiment processes, miR-346, miR-10a-5p and miR-34a-5p were found significantly elevated in PTC plasma samples relative to HCs. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of the three-miRNA panel for the training, testing and validation phases were 0.926, 0.811 and 0.816, separately. The panel could also differentiate PTC from NG with the AUC of 0.877. MiR-346 and miR-34a-5p but not miR-10a-5p were up-regulated in PTC tissues. And the three miRNAs showed consistently up-regulation in PTC plasma exosomes. In conclusion, our study established a three-miRNA panel in plasma with considerable clinical value in discriminating PTC from HC or NG.

AB Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is one of the most abundant retrotransposons in the primate genomes and has contributed to their genome diversity and variations during the primate evolution. Among primate L1 subfamilies, L1Pt subfamilies include Pan troglodytes-specific L1s. L1Pt elements have been successfully expanded in the chimpanzee genome since the divergence of human and chimpanzee lineages. However, only a few full-length L1Pt copies were previously detected in the chimpanzee genome due to incomplete chimpanzee reference genome sequences at the time. In the present study, we aimed to identify chimpanzee-specific L1s using the most recent version of the chimpanzee reference genome (May 2016, panTro5). We identified a total of 3731 chimpanzee-specific L1s. This is much more than previously reported chimpanzee-specific L1 copies. Among these, 223 are full-length (> 6 kb), and we annotated their subfamilies and examined their retrotransposition-competency. The result showed that there are two L1Pt subfamilies in the chimpanzee genome, and the nine structurally intact elements belong to L1Pt-1, L1Pt-2, and L1PA2 subfamilies. In addition, we found that the intact full-length L1 group showed significantly higher L1 expression level than the non-intact full-length L1 group using limited RNA-seq data. It is interesting to notice that the number of retrotransposition-competent elements is much less in the chimpanzee genome than that in the human genome. In conclusion, there is increasing evidence to indicate that chimpanzee-specific L1s have changed the chimpanzee genome, causing genomic difference from other primate genomes.

AB As an important natural enemy of aphids and other pests in agriculture, Harmonia axyridis has been widely used in classic biological control. The testis and male accessory gland (MAG) of H. axyridis are typically associated with the ability of egg-laying by multiple mating and influence mass artificial breeding for biological control. Development-related genes might impact the growth of adult testis and MAGs, but this has not yet been reported. Here, we use an integrative time-series analysis with RNA-seq in the testis and MAGs of H. axyridis adults to detect development-related genes. > 10.3 Gb of clean data were obtained. All differentially expressed genes (DEG) between samples were analyzed with five databases for building a DEG annotation database. By combining previous reports, the DEG annotation database, and gene expression level changes in four different stages, the 26 DEGs related to testis and MAGs development were identified. To validate the expression profile, 15 random DEGs were chosen to perform RT-qPCR, and they were all in accordance with the RNA-Seq results. Taken together, this study established a robust pipeline for the discovery of key genes using RNA-seq and allowed for the class identification of development-related genes in the testis and MAGs for comprehensive characterization.

AB TPA is considered to be a tumor promoting molecule that induces the expression of COX-2 protein. However, it is contradictory to find that TPA can induce tumor cell apoptosis and exert antitumor activity. Therefore, the role of TPA in tumorigenesis and development has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that TPA can promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cells and increase the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. It is suggested that TPA may induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells through mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Further studies showed that TPA could cause mitochondrial dysfunction and trigger mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In mechanism, the mitochondrial targeting of TR3 is involved in TPA induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TPA can play a role in inhibiting cancer by inducing apoptosis and TR3 is expected to be a new target for cancer treatment.

AB The human SLC25A13 gene encodes the liver type aspartate/glutamate carrier isoform 2 (AGC2, commonly named as citrin), which plays a key role in the main NADH-shuttle of human hepatocyte. Biallelic SLC25A13 mutations result in Citrin deficiency (CD). In order to identify the important regulatory region of SLC25A13 gene and elucidate the way how potential promoter mutations affect the citrin expression, we performed promoter deletion analysis and established the reporter constructs of luciferase gene-carrying SLC25A13 promoter containing several mutations located in putative transcription factor-binding sites. The luciferase activities of all promoter constructs were measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the promoter of SLC25A13 gene lacks TATA box and obviously typical initiator element, but contains a CCAAT box and two GC box. Promoter deletion analysis confirmed the region from -221 to -1 upstream ATG was essential for SLC25A13 to maintain the promoter activity. We utilized dual-luciferase reporter system as function analytical model to tentatively assess the effect of artificially constructed promoter mutations on citrin expression, and our analysis revealed that mutated putative CCAAT box and GC box could significantly affect the citrin expression. Our study confirmed the important SLC25A13 promoter regions that influenced citrin expression in HL7702 cells, and constructed a function analytical model. This work may be useful to further identify the pathogenic mutations leading to CD in the promoter region.

AB Background: Protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), an endoplasmic reticulum protein, is expressed in bladder of BC patients. However, its role in BC has been elusive till now.
   Objectives: This study was conducted to assess whether PDIA3 gene expression was associated with increased odds of BC, in particular muscle-invasive BC (MIBC).
   Methods: Ninety three patients underwent cystoscopy and bladder tumors were biopsied and histologically assessed. Data collected including: patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Biochemical markers: hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), Malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy 2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and reduced glutathione (GSH) and molecular marker PDIA3 gene expression were measured.
   Results: According to the tumor grade and stage, 36 patients were found to have MIBC, 27 patients have non MIBC (NMIBC) and 30 patients have no bladder lesions (control group). PDIA3 gene expression level had the largest contribution to a multivariable model for predicting BC, which achieved 89.0% predictive accuracy. The AUC for discriminating MIBC significantly increased from 0.644 to 0.938 when biochemical markers were replaced by molecular PDIA3 marker in the final model.
   Conclusions: Using PDIA3 expression along with prior information of patient's age, bilharzial history with gross hematuria, can help clinicians predict BC, discriminate MIBC and decide consequently the most promising therapeutic management in Egyptian population.

AB Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in carcinogenesis. It is necessary to uncover the detailed pattern of comprehensive lncRNA expression in the genome during the development of gastric cancer (GC). We implemented lncRNA microarray analysis in 5 paired GC tissues to detect the lncRNA expression profile. Moreover, we set out to explore the biological function, clinical application and molecular basis of the aberrant lncRNA in GC. In addition, we used the high-throughput microarray to identify the target gene of the aberrant lncRNA. We found that FLJ22763, a novel lncRNA, had significantly lower expression in GC tissues. Decreased expression of FLJ22763 was positively correlated with a lower-level histological grade and the depth of invasion. The ectopic expression of lncRNA FLJ22763 significantly suppressed the biological malignant behavior of GC cells and inhibited xenograft tumor growth (both P < 0.001). Notably, FLJ22763 displayed a considerable predictive effect in the prognosis of GC (log-rank, P = 0.003). Furthermore, we found that FLJ22763 was negatively associated with ACLY, regulating the mRNA and protein levels of ACLY. Our findings suggested that FLJ22763 may act as a suppressor gene to regulate the expression of ACLY, and its down-expression may be an independent prognostic factor in patients with GC.

AB Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an essential role in a variety of biological processes including wound healing, inflammation, cell invasion, angiogenesis and immune defense. In this study, a putative MMP1 cDNA was cloned and characterized from Hyriopsis cumingii (designated as HcMMP1). The cDNA was 1822 bp in length and encoded a putative protein of 510 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 58.28 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 9.27. HcMMP1 contained all prototype MMPs family signatures, such as signal peptide, prodomain, catalytic center, hinge region, and hemopexin like domain. Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that in mussels HcMMP1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested, and the transcriptional expression levels were significantly up-regulated in hepatopancreas and hemocytes after Aeromonas hydrophila, peptidoglycan stimulations and in mantle after wounding. Moreover, the recombination HcMMP1 protein, successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, was purified by affinity chromatography with the concentration of final yield at 0.3 mg/mL. The recombinase had an essentially hydrolytic activity toward rat type I collagen, mouse II and IV collagen after renaturation.

AB Mitten crab (Eriocheir sensu stricto) is an indigenous and economically important species in East Asia. The genetic diversity and population structure of four wild native Eriocheir s. s. populations, from Yangtze (YZ), Oujiang (OJ), Minjiang (MJ), and Nanliujiang (NLJ) River basin, were studied. Genetic diversity of the four populations was evaluated by eight microsatellite and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunits I (COI) markers. The polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.7827 to 0.8580 and Shannon Wiener index (I) values varied from 2.0722 to 2.4088 respectively, according to microsatellite markers analysis. The haplotype diversity (h) values ranged from 0.52101 to 0.87097, while the values of nucleotide diversity (pi) varied from 0.00139 to 0.02796 based on mitochondrial COI gene sequence. Four wild Eriocheir s. s. populations all showed high genetic diversity. As microsatellite analysis results, pair-wise F-ST values of YZ, OJ, MJ and NLJ populations were 0.1347, 0.1103 and 0.0943 respectively, which indicated that they were in medium genetic differentiation (0.05 < F-ST < 0.15). This was consistent with mitochondrial COI gene's conclusion. The bottleneck analysis was a hint that Eriocheir s. s. experienced bottleneck effect under SMM models of Sign Test and Wilcoxon Sign rank Test. Based on genetic structure, YZ, OJ and MJ populations were in the same cluster separated from NLJ population. In summary, by microsatellite and mitochondrial COI markers analysis, all four Eriocheir s. s. populations had high genetic diversity, and genetic differentiation was consistent with geographical distance. Populations OJ and MJ were closer to population YZ genetically, and they had large genetic distance with NLJ population. This study provides a particularly important basis for mitten crab resources conservation and utilization in south China.

AB Arabinosyl tranferases (embA, embB, embC) are the key enzymes responsible for biogenesis of arabinan domain of arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), two major heteropolysaccharide constituents of the peculiar mycobacterial cell envelope. EmbC is predominantly responsible for LAM synthesis and has been commonly associated with Ethambutol resistance. We have screened the FDA library against EmbC to reposition a drug better than Ethambutol with higher binding affinity to Embc. High throughput virtual screening followed by extra precision docking using Glide gave two best leads i.e. Terlipressin and Amikacin with docking score of -11.39 kcal/mol and -10.71 kcal/mol, respectively. Binding mechanics of the selected drugs was elucidated through long range molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) using binding free energy rescoring, essential dynamics and free energy minima based approaches, thus revealing the most stable binding modes of Terlipressin with EmbC. Our study establishes the EmbC binding potential of the repurposed drugs Terlipressin and Amikacin.

AB Expression of hordeins and beta-amylase during barley grain development is important in determining malting quality parameters that are controlled by protein and malt enzyme levels. The relationship between protein and enzyme levels is confounding because, in general, protein and malt enzyme activity are positively correlated and the malting and brewing industries demand relatively low levels of protein and relatively high levels of enzymes. Separation of these traits is desirable because high protein levels are one of the primary causes of barley not meeting malt quality standards. Studies on barley grain development have not resulted in a consensus on the temporal accumulation of hordein and endosperm-specific beta-amylase (Bmy1) and thus, it is unclear whether hordeins and Bmy1 are under control of the same temporal regulator (s). Therefore, temporal expression patterns of hordeins (B- [Hor2], C- [Hor1], D- [Hor3], and gamma-hordein [Hor5]) were compared to Bmy1 throughout grain development (5 to 35 days after anthesis (DAA)). Transcript accumulation between hordeins and Bmy1 occurred simultaneously beginning during the pre-storage phase of grain development whereas the B1-hordein protein appeared two days before Bmy1 most likely due to variations in gene copy number. Interestingly, the largest increase in hordein and Bmy1 transcript levels occurred between 5 and 9 (Hor2, Hor2-B1, Hor2-B3, Hor3, Hor5-gamma 1, and Hor5-gamma 3) or 9 and 13 DAA (Hor1 and Bmy1). Additionally, ubiquitous beta-amylase (Bmy2) has a novel expression pattern and was the predominant beta-amylase present between 5 and 15 DAA whereas Bmy1 was the predominant beta-amylase present between 17 and 35 DAA.

AB Swine influenza A virus (SwIV) infection has considerable economic and animal welfare consequences and, because of the zoonotic potential, can also have public health implications. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 'swine-origin' infection is now endemic in both pigs and humans. In Europe, avian-like H1(av)N1, human-like H1(hu)N2, human-like swine H3N2 and, since 2009, pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) lineage viruses and reassortants, constitute the dominant subtypes. In this study, we used a swine pH1N1 challenge virus to investigate the efficacy of whole inactivated virus vaccines homologous or heterologous to the challenge virus as well as a commercial vaccine. We found that vaccine-mediated protection was most effective when vaccine antigen and challenge virus were homologous and correlated with the specific production of neutralising antibodies and a cellular response to the challenge virus.

AB Objectives: To review the literature on economic evaluation of dengue vaccination to produce evidence to support a local cost-effectiveness study and to subsidize the decision to introduce a dengue vaccine in the Brazilian National Immunization Program. Methods: We systematically searched multiple databases (MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, SCOPUS, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), HTA Database (via Centre for Reviews and Dissemination - CRD) and LILACS), selecting full HEEs of dengue vaccine. Two independent reviewers screened articles for relevance and extracted the data. The methodology for the quality reporting was assessed using CHEERS checklist. We performed a qualitative narrative synthesis. Results: Thirteen studies conducted in Asian and Latin America countries were reviewed. All studies were favorable to the incorporation of the vaccine. However, the assumptions and values assumed for vaccine efficacy, safety and duration of protection, as well as the choice of the study population and the type of model used in the analyses, associated to an insufficient reporting of the methodological steps, affect the validity of the studies' results. The quality reporting appraisal showed that the majority (8/13) of the studies reported less than 55% of the CHEERS checklists' items. Conclusions: This systematic review shows that the economic evaluation of dengue vaccination did not adhere to key recommended general methods for economic evaluation. The presented cost-effectiveness results should not be transferred to other countries. It is recommended to conduct studies with local epidemiological and cost data, as well as assumptions about vaccination that reflect the results observed in clinical trials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Planning and monitoring vaccine introduction and effectiveness relies on strong vaccine preventable disease (VPD) surveillance. In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) especially, cost is a commonly reported barrier to VPD surveillance system maintenance and performance; however, it is rarely calculated or assessed. This review describes and compares studies on the availability of cost information for VPD surveillance systems in LMICs to facilitate the design of future cost studies of VPD surveillance.
   Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and EconLit were used to identify peer-reviewed articles and Google was searched for relevant grey literature. Studies selected described characteristics and results of VPD surveillance systems cost studies performed in LMICs. Studies were categorized according to the type of VPD surveillance system, study aim, the annual cost of the system, and per capita costs.
   Results: Eleven studies were identified that assessed the cost of VPD surveillance systems. The studies assessed systems from six low-income countries, two low-middle-income countries, and three middle income countries. The majority of the studies (n = 7) were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and fifteen distinct VPD surveillance systems were assessed across the studies. Most studies aimed to estimate incremental costs of additional surveillance components and presented VPD surveillance system costs as mean annual costs per resource category, health structure level, and by VPD surveillance activity. Staff time/personnel cost represents the largest cost driver, ranging from 21% to 61% of total VPD surveillance system costs across nine studies identifying a cost driver.
   Conclusions: This review provides a starting point to guide LMICs to invest and advocate for more robust VPD surveillance systems. Critical gaps were identified including limited information on the cost of laboratory surveillance, challenges with costing shared resources, and missing data on capital costs. Appropriate guidance is needed to guide LMICs conducting studies on VPD surveillance system costs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Induction of a sustained and broad antibody (Ab) response is a major goal in developing a protective HIV-1 vaccine. DNA priming alone shows reduced levels of immunogenicity; however, when combined with protein boosting is an attractive vaccination strategy for induction of humoral responses. Using the VC10014 DNA and protein-based vaccine consisting of HIV-1 envelope (Env) gp160 plasmids and trimeric gp140 proteins derived from an HIV-1 Glade B infected subject who developed broadly neutralizing serum Abs, and which has been previously demonstrated to induce Tier 2 heterologous neutralizing Abs in rhesus macaques, we evaluated whether MPLA and IL-33 when administered during the DNA priming phase enhances the humoral response in mice. The addition of IL-33 during the gpl60 DNA priming phase resulted in high titer gp120-specific plasma IgG after the first immunization. The IL-33 treated mice had higher plasma IgG Ab avidity, breadth, and durability after DNA and protein co-immunization with alum adjuvant as compared to MPLA and alum only treated mice. IL-33 was also associated with a significant IgM Env-specific response and expansion of peritoneal and splenic B-1b B cells. These results indicate that DNA priming in the presence of exogenous IL-33 qualitatively alters the HIV-1 Env-specific humoral response, improving the kinetics and breadth of potentially protective Ab.

AB Objective: Delayed vaccination increases the susceptibility window for vaccine preventable diseases. Our analysis estimates the proportion of children between 10 and 23 months of age with delayed vaccination in India and the associated socio-demographic, maternal and child related factors.
   Methods: We used individual level data from the National Family and Health Survey 4, conducted in 2015-2016. The primary outcome of the study was delayed vaccination for BCG, DPT- 1st dose and Measles. Delayed vaccination for each vaccine was defined as administration of the vaccine dose after 28 days of the minimum recommended age, as per the national immunization schedule in India. We estimated the proportion of children with delayed vaccination for each vaccine and used multivariable logistic regression to explore associated factors.
   Findings: In the current analysis, 23.1%, 29.3% and 34.8% of children aged 10 to 23 months had delayed vaccination for BCG, DPT-1st dose and Measles respectively. Children from Muslim families (aOR 1.36 for BCG; aOR 1.45 for DPT-1; aOR 1.26 for Measles); birth weight < 2000 g (aOR 2.33 for BCG; aOR 1.53 for DPT-1; aOR 1.36 for Measles) had higher odds of delayed vaccination. Lower maternal education and belonging to a family from lower wealth quintile had higher odds of delayed vaccination. Children of mothers who had tetanus toxoid immunization during pregnancy had lower odds of delayed vaccination (aOR 0.69 for BCG; aOR 0.76 for DPT-1; aOR 0.78 for Measles).
   Conclusion: The proportion of children with delayed vaccination is high in India. Vaccine timeliness should be a core indicator of the immunization program with greater focus on groups with higher chances of delayed vaccination i.e. home birth, low birth weight new-borns, poorer households, children of mothers with lower education and children from Muslim families.

ID CLEAVAGE
AB Poliovirus (PV) is a pathogen that causes poliomyelitis, which may lead to paralysis and fatality. Inactivated PV vaccines (IPVs) and live-attenuated oral PV vaccines (OPVs) are currently used to defend against PV worldwide. Vaccines must be developed in a PV-free environment given the biosafety issues associated with OPV and IPV production and to eradicate PV globally. In this study, PV1, PV2, and PV3 virus-like particles with enhanced thermostability (PV-sVLPs) were produced in large quantities by using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). Mice immunized with PV-sVLPs generated antibodies with strong PV-neutralizing response. In addition, splenocytes collected from immunized mice expressed high levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2, GM-CSF, IL-5, and IL-10 upon PV-sVLPs stimulation. These data suggest that PV-sVLPs can serve as vaccines against PV infection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Successful vaccinations rely on antibody responses. Chemokine receptors play an important role in B cell homing to differentiation niches. We assessed CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR6 expression on B cells during HIV-1 infection and relate it to antibody responses against a HBV vaccine.
   Methods: Blood was obtained from 54 healthy controls and 38 ART-treated HIV-1 infected children, aviremic (n = 25) or viremic (n = 13). Frequency of naive and memory B cell subsets was studied by immunostaining. Homing capacity of blood B cells to lymphoid and inflamed tissues was evaluated through CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR6 expression. Plasma CXCL12 and CXCL13 levels and antibody titers to HBV antigen were determined by ELISA.
   Results: The frequency of naive and resting memory (RM) B cells in ART treated children was comparable to control subjects. Profound defects in the homing phenotypes of naive and memory B cells were identified, with lower CXCR4 and CXCR5 expression. Increased CXCL13 levels were observed in infected children, inversely correlating to CXCR5 expressing B cell subpopulations. Antibody titers to HBV vaccine correlated with frequency of resting and switched memory B cells in HIV-1 infected children.
   Conclusions: Homing defects of B cells to germinal center may underlie impaired vaccine responses during HIV-1 infection. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Modeling the economic impact of different vial-opening thresholds for
   measles-containing vaccines
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Measles vaccine; Vaccine supply chain; Presentation; Policy
ID IMMUNIZATION; BENEFITS; HEALTH
AB Introduction: The lack of specific policies on how many children must be present at a vaccinating location before a healthcare worker can open a measles-containing vaccine (MCV) - i.e. the vial-opening threshold - has led to inconsistent practices, which can have wide-ranging systems effects.
   Methods: Using HERMES-generated simulation models of the routine immunization supply chains of Benin, Mozambique and Niger, we evaluated the impact of different vial-opening thresholds (none, 30% of doses must be used, 60%) and MCV presentations (10-dose, 5-dose) on each supply chain. We linked these outputs to a clinical- and economic-outcomes model which translated the change in vaccine availability to associated infections, medical costs, and DALYs. We calculated the economic impact of each policy from the health system perspective.
   Results: The vial-opening threshold that maximizes vaccine availability while minimizing costs varies between individual countries. In Benin (median session size = 5), implementing a 30% vial-opening threshold and tailoring distribution of 10-dose and 5-dose MCVs to clinics based on session size is the most cost-effective policy, preventing 671 DALYs ($471 /DALY averted) compared to baseline (no threshold, 10-dose MCVs). In Niger (median MCV session size = 9), setting a 60% vial-opening threshold and tailoring MCV presentations is the most cost-effective policy, preventing 2897 DALYs (816.05/ DALY averted). In Mozambique (median session size = 3), setting a 30% vial-opening threshold using 10-dose MCVs is the only beneficial policy compared to baseline, preventing 3081 DALYs ($85.98/DALY averted). Across all three countries, however, a 30% vial-opening threshold using 10-dose MCVs everywhere is the only MCV threshold that consistently benefits each system compared to baseline.
   Conclusion: While the ideal vial-opening threshold policy for MCV varies by supply chain, implementing a 30% vial-opening threshold for 10-dose MCVs benefits each system by improving overall vaccine availability and reducing associated medical costs and DALYs compared to no threshold.

AB Since the first identification of the H5N1 Goose/Guangdong lineage in 1996, this highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has spread worldwide, becoming endemic in domestic poultry. Sporadic transmission to humans has raised concerns of a potential pandemic and underscores the need for a broad crossprotective influenza vaccine. Here, we tested our previously described methodology, termed Computationally Optimized Broadly Reactive Antigen (COBRA), to generate a novel hemagglutinin (HA) gene, termed COBRA-2, that was based on H5 HA sequences from 2005 to 2006. The COBRA-2 HA virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines were used to vaccinate chickens and the immune responses were compared to responses elicited by VLP's expressing HA from A/whooper swan/Mongolia/244/2005 (WS/05), a representative 2005 vaccine virus from Glade 2.2. To support this evaluation a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) breadth panel was developed consisting of phylogenetically and antigenically diverse H5 strains in circulation from 2005 to 2006, as well as recent drift variants (2008 - 2014). We found that the COBRA-2 VLP vaccines elicited robust HAI titers against this entire breadth panel, whereas the VLP vaccine based upon the recommended WS/05 HA only elicited HAI responses against a subset of strains. Furthermore, while all vaccines protected chickens against challenge with the WS/05 virus, only the human COBRA-2 VLP vaccinated birds were protected (80%) against a recent drifted Glade 2.3.2.1B, A/ duck/Vietnam/NCVD-672/2011 (VN/11) virus. This is the first report to demonstrate seroprotective antibody responses against genetically diverse clades and sub-clades of H5 viruses and protective efficacy against a recent drifted variant using a globular head based design strategy.

DT Article
DE Vaccination; Economic; Hard-to-reach populations
ID IMMUNIZATION; COVERAGE
AB Background: Since special efforts are necessary to vaccinate people living far from fixed vaccination posts, decision makers are interested in knowing the economic value of such efforts.
   Methods: Using our immunization geospatial information system platform and a measles compartment model, we quantified the health and economic value of a 2-dose measles immunization outreach strategy for children <24 months of age in Kenya who are geographically hard-to-reach (i.e., those living outside a specified catchment radius from fixed vaccination posts, which served as a proxy for access to services).
   Findings: When geographically hard-to-reach children were not vaccinated, there were 1427 total measles cases from 2016 to 2020, resulting in $9.5 million ($3.1-$18.1 million) in direct medical costs and productivity losses and 7504 (3338-12,903) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The outreach strategy cost $76 ($23-$142)/DALY averted (compared to no outreach) when 25% of geographically hard-to-reach children received MCV1, $122 ($40-$226)/DALY averted when 50% received MCV1, and $274 ($123-$478)/DALY averted when 100% received MCV1.
   Conclusion: Outreach vaccination among geographically hard-to-reach populations was highly cost-effective in a wide variety of scenarios, offering support for investment in an effective outreach vaccination strategy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Serological surveys can potentially complement vaccine coverage surveys, such as post- vaccination campaign coverage evaluation surveys (PCES), by providing direct information on population immunity within and outside the target age range of the mass vaccination campaign. We estimate age specific population immunity to measles and rubella viruses in Southern Province, Zambia, and assess the value of adding serological data to vaccination coverage estimates by nesting a serological survey within a PCES.
   Methods: Dried blood spots (DBS) from fingerprick blood were collected from all individuals ages nine months or older in households participating in the PCES and tested for measles and rubella virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) by enzyme immunoassay (Siemens Enzygnost, Marburg, Germany).
   Results: Overall seroprevalence was 95.5% (95% CI: 92.8, 97.2) for measles virus-specific IgG and 97.7% (95% CI: 96.0, 98.7) for rubella virus-specific IgG. Rubella seroprevalence was 98.4% (95% CI: 95.9, 99.4) among children eligible for the MR vaccination campaign, significantly higher than the reported measles-rubella (MR) vaccination campaign coverage of 89.8% (p = 0.003), and higher than the 91.3% rubella seroprevalence for adolescents and adults 16-30 years of age (p = 0.049).
   Conclusion: Seroprevalence to measles and rubella viruses in children younger than 16 years of age was significantly higher than expected from vaccination coverage estimates, likely reflecting exposure to wild-type viruses and underreporting of vaccination. The serosurvey revealed rubella immunity gaps among women 16-30 years of age, precisely the age group in which protection from rubella is most important to prevent congenital rubella syndrome. Nesting serological surveys within existing surveys can leverage resources and infrastructure while providing complementary information important to immunization programs. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

TI Successful switch (tOPV to bOPV) in India: Tribute to a resilient health

SO VACCINE

DE Switch strategy; Validation; bOPV; tOPV
AB In accordance with the end game strategies for polio eradication a synchronized switch plan from tOPV to bOPV was implemented globally in 2016. The National Committee for Polio Eradication (NCCPE) validated the switch activities in India. An expert group of 104 academics conducted field visits in 25 states and 2 Union territories for independent verification (after an initial round of verification by the National Polio Surveillance Project [NPSP]). The objectives were to validate withdrawal and disposal of tOPV by screening cold chain points in public and private sector health facilities in both rural and urban areas; additionally, availability of bOPV and IPV was also documented. 34 filled tOPV and 5 empty vials were detected inside cold chain equipment and 17 outside. The disposal mechanism was found to be reasonably adequate. The key strategies -- 'throttling' of vaccine supplies well ahead of the switch date while preventing stock outs at various immunization points, simultaneously working with the regulators to delicense the tOPV on the switch date and helping manufacturers to calibrate vaccine production according to national timelines, and strong and persistent advocacy with professional associations to align with national bOPV and IPV policy facilitated successful accomplishment of the switch process. Effective implementation of the switch strategy in India also bears testimony to the resilience of the health system operating under diverse and heterogeneous governance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As Ixodes ticks spread to new regions, the incidence of Lyme disease (LD) in companion animals and humans will increase. Preventive strategies for LD in canines center on vaccination and tick control (acaricides). Both subunit and bacterin based LD veterinary vaccines are available. Outer surface protein C (OspC), a potent immunogen and dominant early antigen, has been demonstrated to elicit protective antibody (Ab) responses. However, a single OspC protein elicits a relatively narrow range of protection. There are conflicting reports as to whether the immunodominant epitopes of OspC reside within variable or conserved domains. A detailed understanding of the antigenic determinants of OspC is essential for understanding immune responses to this essential virulence factor and vaccinogen. Here, we investigate the contribution of the conserved C-terminal C10 motif in OspC triggered Ab responses. Using a panel of diverse recombinant full length OspC proteins and their corresponding C10 deletion variants (OspC Delta C10), we demonstrate that the C10 motif does not significantly contribute to immunization or infection induced Ab responses in rabbits, rats, canines, horses and non-human primates. Furthermore, the C10 motif is not required to trigger potent bactericidal Ab responses. This study provides insight into the antigenic structure of OspC. The results enhance our understanding of immune responses that develop during infection or upon vaccination and have implications for interpretation of LD diagnostic assays that employ OspC.

AB Background: Ontario implemented a publicly-funded rotavirus (RV) immunization program in 2011. Our objectives were to evaluate its impact on hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) five years after implementation.
   Methods: We performed a population-based longitudinal retrospective cohort study to identify hospitalizations and ED visits for RV-AGE and overall AGE in all age groups using ICD-10 codes between August 1, 2005 and March 31, 2016. A negative binomial regression model that included the effect of time was used to calculate rates, rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cis) for AGE before and after the program's implementation, after adjusting for age, seasonality and secular trends. We examined the seasonality of RV-AGE hospitalizations among children under five before and after the program and explored its equity impact.
   Results: Following program implementation, RV-AGE hospitalizations and ED visits among children under five years declined by 76% (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.20-0.28) and 68% (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.50), respectively. In addition, hospitalizations and ED visits for overall AGE declined by 38% (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.59-0.65) and 26% (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.73-0.76), respectively, among children under age five. Significant reductions in both outcomes were also found across a range of age-strata. In the pre-program period, the mean monthly hospitalization rate for RV-AGE among children residing in the most marginalized neighbourhoods was 33% higher than those residing in the least marginalized (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17-1.52), this disparity was not evident in the program period (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69-1.32). We found no evidence of a seasonal shift in rotavirus pediatric hospitalizations.
   Interpretation: The introduction of routine infant rotavirus immunization has had a substantial population impact in Ontario. Our study confirms herd effects and suggests the program may have reduced previous inequities in the burden of pediatric rotavirus hospitalizations.

AB Vaccination remains the most successful and effective mechanism of pathogen control. However, their development and deployment in epidemic settings have been limited, and the 2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa identified several bottlenecks linked to a lack of investment in pathogen research, infrastructure or regulation. Shortly after this outbreak, the UK Government established the UK Vaccine Network to ensure the UK is better prepared to respond to pathogens outbreaks of epidemic potential. As part of their work, the network commissioned the creation of a Vaccine Development Tool (http://www.vaccinedevelopment.org.ukJ ) to serve as a guide to the key stages in vaccine development. The tool also set out to capture the key, rate-limiting bottlenecks in the development of vaccines against emerging infectious disease such that corrective action could be taken, be it through research, funding, infrastructure and policy, both in the UK and internationally. The main research bottlenecks were related to understanding pathogen biology, identification of appropriate animal models and investment in the manufacturing sciences, especially into process development. Infrastructure gaps in GMP manufacturing and fill-finish were also identified and limitations in GMO regulation and regulatory and ethical approvals, especially for outbreak pathogens required new policy initiatives. The UK Vaccine Network has since begun work to correct for these limitations with a series of funding calls and development programmes. This paper seeks to summarise the Vaccine Development Tool and its key findings. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Robert Koch (1843-1910), who was one of the significant representatives of the golden age of microbiology, claimed to have discovered the tuberculin/vaccine therapy in 1890. During that era, the Ottoman Empire closely followed the important developments in the field of microbiology. For this reason, it was decided that a delegation should have been sent to Germany to observe the lecture "On Bacteriological Research" to be delivered by Koch on August 3, 1890 during the 10th International Congress of Medicine to be held in Berlin. The delegation travelled to Germany and carried out observations and met Koch in the meanwhile. Among the delegation sent to Berlin there was also Dr. Huseyin Hulki Bey, who graduated from the Military School of Medicine in 1885, and could speak French, Greek, Farsi and Arabic. One of the young professors of the medical school, Dr. H. Hulki gathered his memories on the trip to Berlin in a book after his return. In his book published under the title Berlin Memories (1892), he related the interview they held with Koch, the various medical centres they visited in Berlin, and the physicians they met there.
   This study aims to provide knowledge on the interview held with Koch in Berlin, and its reflections on the Ottoman medicine, in the light of Dr. H. Hulki's memories and other sources shedding light on the relations between Germany and Turkey in the 1890s. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The shear-wave splitting parameters (i.e. fast axes orientation (Psi) and delay time (delta t)) are measured at four broadband stations in Rajasthan, using SKS/SKKS core phases from three-component broadband waveforms of 30 events recorded during 2014-16. The thicknesses of lithosphere at these four stations are also inferred from the estimated delays. The average splitting parameters (Psi, delta t) at the northern-most (JAI) and southern-most (BAN) stations are modeled to be 36.44 degrees +/- 08.36 degrees and 1.48 +/- 0.32 s, and 35.72* +/- 10.47 degrees and 1.86 +/- 0.34 s, respectively. While these parameters at UDI and BUN stations are found to be 41.08 degrees +/- 08.54 degrees and 1.61 +/- 0.26 s, and 43.86 degrees +/- 08.96 degrees and 1.68 +/- 0.27 s, respectively. Thus, our modeling reveals a mean fast axes orientation of (39 degrees +/- 9 degrees) with a mean delay of 1.7 +/- 0.3 s, for Rajasthan, which could be attributed to the frozen lithospheric anisotropy in the direction of current absolute plate motion of the Indian plate. A slight regional variation of observed orientation of fast axes ranging from 35.7 degrees(at BAN) to 43.9 degrees (at BUN)could be attributed to the tectonic control rather than current plate motion. In addition, the mean orientations of fast axes are measured to be 36.4 degrees at UDI and 41.1 degrees at JAI, respectively. Thus, this observed coherent variation of fast axes orientation across the Rajasthan suggests a significant contribution from the asthenospheric flow. Further, estimated mean delay time (1.7 +/- 0.3 s) does also suggest a contribution from the anisotropy associated with asthenospheric flows. The maximum delay (similar to 1.86 s) is estimated at southernmost BAN station, suggesting a thick anisotropic layer of similar to 214 km, while minimum delay (similar to 1.48 s) is modeled at northernmost JAI station, suggesting a 170-km thick anisotropic layer. While asthenospheric layer thicknesses at UDI and BUN are found to be 185 and 193 km, respectively. This observation suggests a relatively more anisotropic and thick lithosphere in the south in comparison to that in the north. The measured deviation of fast axis orientation from the absolute Indian plate motion varies from 1 to 4.3 degrees, which could be related to the changes in asthenosphric flow pattern due to the presence of topography at the base of lithosphere.

High-grade mafic and supracrustal rocks occurring in the Chencai terrane of the Cathaysia Block are the uplifted lower crustal components of the Kwangsian (Early Paleozoic) Orogen which extensively reshaped many parts of the SCB. Two amphibolites, three biotite-bearing amphibolites, one norite and one mafic granulite were collected from the Chencai terrane. In previous studies, these rocks (or their protoliths) have been suggested to belong to the same cumulate series and the mafic granulite records metamorphic P-T conditions of a high-geothermal-gradient environment (similar to 30 degrees C/km). Our SIMS zircon U-Pb results indicate that protoliths of these meta-mafic rocks were emplaced at similar to 434-445 Ma and most of them have experienced subsequent (almost synchronous) metamorphism at 428-439 Ma. The norite sample (434 Ma), which experienced the least crustal contamination and the least metamorphic alteration, has the lowest zircon delta O-18 values of similar to+ 6.7 parts per thousand (V-SMOW), whereas the mafic granulite which experienced the highest grade metamorphism has the highest zircon delta O-18 values of similar to+9.4 parts per thousand (V-SMOW). Zircon delta O-18 values of other samples mostly scatter between them. Most metamorphic zircons have younger U-Pb ages and higher delta O-18 values than magmatic zircons. High delta O-18 crustal materials (e.g. sedimentary rocks) have possibly been involved during the metamorphism which resulted in the contrasting delta O-18 values of magmatic and metamorphic zircons. The large variations in delta O-18 values shown by magmatic zircons of each sample (like the amphibolite and biotite-bearing amphibolite) indicate that the high-delta O-18-value crustal materials (sedimentary rocks) must have started to affect these mafic rocks since the magmatic stage. Zircon 178 (Hf)/177(Hf) values of each of these samples scatter within small ranges. Initial epsilon(Hf)(t) values of most zircons fall in between the CHUR line and the DM linear model line, indicating that these mafic rocks were derived from an enriched mantle source. Combined with previous geochronological, metamorphic and geochemical data, we propose that these Paleozoic mafic magmatism might have contributed thermal energy to the later thermal relaxation of the orogeny. This episode of mafic magmatism may represent a transition of the Kwangsian Orogen from early compression to post-orogenic extension. Metamorphism of these mafic rocks and the synchronous anatexis indicated by the high grade supracrustal rocks from Chencai terrane, might be related with extension rather than orogenic compression.

AB The spatial variations in the seismic b-value, seismic moment, Bouguer gravity change and fault-plane solution are estimated in the Sumatran region based on homogeneous seismicity data from June 2005 to March 2012 to investigate the seismotectonic characteristics and tectonic activity between the 2004 Sumatran earthquake and the 2012 East Indian Ocean earthquakes. Based on changes in the seismicity rate, this time period is divided into five intervals with different earthquake distributions and faulting styles. The seismic b-values, faulting mechanisms and seismic moment release values are mapped throughout the Sumatran region, and the gravity change every two years between the 2004 event and the 2012 events are determined from satellite (GRACE) gravity data. The b-values vary from 0.45 to 1.59, and an inverse correlation is observed between the b-values and convergence rates. Low b-values are located at depths between 20 km and 40 km in the subduction zone and between 20 km and 35 km in the oceanic plate; the lowest b-values are located at a depth of approximately 28 km in both regions, which indicates a homogeneous fault system between them. The areas with low b-values are associated with megathrust and strike-slip mechanisms, while the area with the lowest b-values is dominated by a megathrust mechanism. Seismically active regions have low b-values associated with a high stress accumulation and high seismic moment release. Low b-value areas are located mainly along the Andaman-Sunda Trench and Andaman-Nicobar-Sumatra forearc. Temporal variations in the seismicity distribution and faulting style are recognized with temporal variations in the b-values in each period. Relationships exist between the epicenter of the 2004 event and the location of the maximum Bouguer gravity change in 2012 and between the epicenters of the 2012 events and the location of the maximum Bouguer gravity change in 2004. Furthermore, a zone of continuous 2-year positive gravity change is located near the Nicobar Islands. The 2004 event boost the 2012 events and intraplate seismicity via stress transfer. The seismicity distributions in individual periods within the studied timeframe highlight the active and locked portions of the fault systems.

AB An oceanic Greater Indian Basin was hypothesized to have formed between similar to 120 Ma and similar to 65 Ma by regional extension that separated the cratonic India from its northern margin of Tethyan Himalaya (TH). However, the lack of paleomagnetic data from this critical time interval in the TH marks an important gap in our knowledge about the tectonic evolution of the Greater India. We have conducted a paleomagnetic study of a Cretaceous marine succession in Zhongba, southern Tibet that consists of predominantly purple reddish cherts and siliceous limestone. Paleomagnetic samples from 12 sites were subjected to stepwise thermal demagnetization that revealed either two- or three-component magnetizations with the high-temperature component (HTC) typically unblocked at similar to 650 degrees C. The HTCs exhibit dual polarities that yield a positive reversed test at 95% confidence level, suggesting a primary origin of the remanence. With chronologic constraints from the combined analysis of the magnetostratigraphic and radiolarian data, the HTCs yield a mean of D-s = 336.9 degrees, I-s = - 50.7 degrees, k, = 18.0, alpha(95) = 5.3 degrees for the similar to 120.8-93.9 Ma interval of the TH, which corresponds to a paleopole at 25.0 degrees N, 285.7 degrees E (dp/dm = 4.8/7.1 degrees). The apparent polar wander path (APWP) of the TH overall resembles that of cratonic India, suggesting no polarward separation that is sufficiently large to merit an oceanic basin between the TH and cratonic India. Therefore, our new reliable paleomagnetic data from the critical time interval do not support the Greater Indian Basin hypothesis and its implied dual collisional processes between India and Asia. On the other hand, the APWPs exhibit relative shifts for the post-120 Ma segment and the pre-130 Ma segment, indicating relative motions between the TH and cratonic India that most likely resulted from shearing along boundaryparallel faults during the India-Asia collision.

AB The proposed Triassic age of oceanic subduction and high-pressure/low-temperature (HP-LT) metamorphism in the South Tianshan orogen (STS) of the southwestern Central Asian Orogenic Belt needs to be re-examined on the basis of field relationship and precise age dating. Our biostratigraphic study in the Atbashi Range of southern Kyrgyzstan indicates that sedimentary strata unconformably overlie the HP-LT metamorphic rocks within the Turkestan suture zone and have a late Kasimovian (ca. 305 Ma) age. This constrains the minimum age of eclogite metamorphism in the HP-LT metamorphic complex. A Late Pennsylvanian to early Permian (Asselian) hinterland basin overlaps the margins of the Middle and South Tianshan and the ophiolitic suture between them, thus leaving no space for an oceanic basin in the northern STS in the late Permian or Triassic. In the south, overlap assemblages stitching the STS with the Tarim Craton consist of late Asselian to early Sakmarian limestones and early Permian rhyolites. Early Permian (ca. 295-265 Ma) post-collisional A-type granites and sub-alkaline plutons are widespread in the STS and are not affected by thrust deformation. These facts indicate that thrust packages of the STS were stacked together and welded to the margin of the Tarim Craton by the early Permian. The widespread occurrence of early Permian sub-alkaline granites is also not compatible with an oceanic accretionary wedge setting in the STS during the Permian or Triassic.
   Permian and Triassic zircon ages for subduction-related HP-LT metamorphic rocks and ophiolitic gabbro from the Atbashi and Djandjir ranges reported in two recent papers contradict geological relationships. A review of reported analytical data shows that anomalously young ages in all studied samples are based on geologically meaningless single zircon analyses and/or discordant data, which cannot be used for age calculation. The suggestion that an oceanic basin in the STS remained open and subduction continued until the Middle Triassic is erroneous because of insufficient consideration of basic regional geological relationships and incorrect interpretations of analytical results.

AB The Yinchuan Basin, one of the Cenozoic faulted basins in the western margin of the North China Craton (NCC), was filled by thick Cenozoic fluvial-lacustrine sediments, which documented tectonic-sedimentary processes. However, many debates were highlighted in the Cenozoic tectonic evolution processes due to a lack of ages of the Cenozoic sediments in the basin. In this paper, we provide a high-resolution magnetostratigraphic records of the Yinchuan Basin based on the XL15-1-01 borehole in the southwestern basin. Detailed magnetostratigraphy of the 850-m-thick sedimentary sequences record C2An.ln to C8n.2n of the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale (GPTS) with the age span of similar to 26.06 Ma to similar to 2.77 Ma, corresponding to the middle Oligocene-Pliocene, which delimits the depositional periods of the Qingshuiying, Zhangnengbu, and Ganhegou fomations in the Yinchuan Basin. The upper age limit of the Qingshuiying Formtion is 21.32 Ma, the Zhangnengbu Formation extends from 21.32 to similar to 10.17 Ma, and the Ganhegou Formation spans the interval of similar to 9.58 to similar to 2.77 Ma. The sedimentary discontinuity between the Ganhegou Formtion and the Zhangnengbu Formation in the Yinchuan Basin initiated at similar to 10.17 Ma, which is interpreted as the initial time for the northeastward expansion of the Tibetan Plateau impact on this region, and continued for similar to 0.59 Myr. The depth-age correlation determined from magnetostatigraphy reveals a distinct increase in sedimentation rate at similar to 9.58 Ma, responding to an intensive uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB Employing an efficient and robust prediction system along with early warnings is useful to reduce the effects of devastating earthquakes. Thermal anomaly, as an earthquake precursory, is widely confirmed. In this study, to characterize the thermal anomalies within a 10-year specific observation interval of Land Surface Temperature (LST), satellite data products obtained from MODIS-Aqua (March 16th to May 16th, every year from 2004 to 2013) were analyzed using Robust Satellite Technique (RST) method. The Saravan earthquake (April 16th, 2013, M-w = 7.8, Iran) were used for validation phase, and the year 2012, as a relatively seismically unperturbed year (no earthquakes with M-w > 3.5 regarding target time and region), was taken for confutation phase. For the first time, to reduce the effects of the topography with respect to vegetation cover, using unsupervised classification, the study area was divided into the low and high elevation regions. The results of the present study showed the Significant Sequences of LST Anomalies (SSLAs) from several days before and immediately after the Saravan earthquake appeared in the north, south, and center of the study area. However, no anomalies were observed in a seismically unperturbed year (2012). Therefore, the results confirmed the existence of space-time thermal anomalies related to destructive earthquakes and revealed that the RST method is a reliable approach to detect disturbances of the Earth's thermal emission.

AB The Tian Shan Range, which trends E-W along the southern margin of the Junggar Basin, is one of the longest and most active intracontinental orogenic belts in central Asia. On 8 December 2016 (05:15:04 UTC), a Mw 6.0 earthquake ruptured the northern Tian Shan front. Here, we use Sentinel-1 radar imagery to investigate the deformation and source parameters related to this event. The co-seismic surface deformation was predominated by uplift without surface rupture. Ascending and descending interferograms indicate that the event triggered small co-seismic deformations with maximum line-of-sight displacements of 22 mm and 24 mm, respectively. Although the north-dipping and south-dipping plane solutions can both fit the observations well, the north-dipping solution with a dip of 58 degrees is preferred in consideration of the relocated aftershocks and regional geological structure. Significant slip is located between depths of 12 km and 17 km, suggesting that the event was caused by a completely blind thrust fault. This blind rupture is characterized largely by a compact thrusting patch with a peak slip of 56 cm at a depth of 13 km. The source model generates a geodetic moment of 6.678 x 10(17) N m corresponding to a Mw 5.85 event. Both the interferometric synthetic aperture radar modeling and the aftershock locations indicate that the rupture plane is linked to the Huoerguosi-Manas-Tugulu fault at a depth of similar to 16 km, a typical locking depth in the Tian Shan. We suggest that the 2016 Hutubi earthquake more likely occurred on a back-thrust of the Huoerguosi-Manas-Tugulu fault, and the back-thrust is interpreted to represent a preexisting normal fault beneath the Qigu anticline belt that was tectonically inverted during the Cenozoic.

ID INVERSION; RELEASE
AB Eastern Anatolia is a similar to 2 km high plateau shaped by the continent-continent collision of the Arabian and Eurasian plates. The left lateral East Anatolian Fault Zone, the right lateral North Anatolian Fault Zone and the Bitlis fold-thrust belt are the major tectonic boundaries of this convergence zone. The Arabian-Eurasian collision has resulted in high volcanism and well recorded seismic activity in Eastern Anatolia and its surroundings. Karliova Junction is located at the intersection of these major fault systems and contains secondary faults such as the Karakocan fault and the Sancak-Uzunpmar fault. We processed high quality waveform data collected from a recent seismic activity in the proximity of the city of Bingol where the largest event is the moderate-size earthquake (Mw = 5.3) occurred on 2 December 2015. This event is located to the west of Karliova Junction and to the northwest of Sancak-Uztmpmar fault. The spatial distribution of the aftershocks points out unmapped faults with NNW-SSE alignment towards the west of Sancak-Uzunpinar fault. Aftershock depth distribution indicates a nearly 15 km deep brittle seismogenic zone. The relocated aftershock distributions and seismic moment calculations yield a rupture area 9 km in length and 5 km in width with an average 8 cm of slip. The latest four earthquakes preceding the 2015 Eq with magnitudes larger than Mw > 6 enhanced the Coulomb stress failure in the 2015 Bingol Earthquake rupture area. The ruptured fault plane is in-line with the optimally oriented right-lateral strike-slip faults.

AB To study the Cenozoic tectonic and paleoenvironmental evolution of northwestern China, we drilled two deep boreholes, JLT1 and JLT2, in the Jartai Basin. Magnetostratigraphy, stratigraphy studies were conducted to establish a chronological framework. Sedimentary facies were reconstructed using lithology, geophysical logs (gamma ray (GR) and resistivity (R)) and measurements of grain size, sediment color (L*, a* and b*) and magnetic susceptibility and its frequency dependence. The stratigraphic sequence of borehole JLT2 is similar to that of Paleogene sediments in basins along the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, which may be the result of the far-field effect of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during the Paleocene, via faulting activity. The results of borehole JLT1 indicate that the basin was occupied by alternating desert, lacustrine and alluvial fan environments since ca. 6.7 Ma. During ca. 6.7-3.6 Ma, alternations of aeolian sand and lacustrine facies may reflect climatic cooling and drying, and at that time the area may have been an important sediment source for the aeolian Red Clay of the Loess Plateau. During ca. 3.6-2.1 Ma, alluvial fan development also reflected the uplift of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, and the area acted as a source region for dust supplied to the Loess Plateau and the Shanxi Graben. The alternations of aeolian sand and lacustrine deposits since ca. 2.1 Ma may have resulted from glacial-interglacial variations of the East Asian Monsoon. Since ca. 1.7 Ma, lacustrine deposition developed, because of the enormous discharge of the Yellow River into the Jartai Basin. A tectonic movement at ca. 0.8 Ma is reflected by lacustrine red clay at the top of borehole JLT1. After the mid-Pleistocene transition, the modern landscape of the Jartai Basin and its adjacent regions were formed.

AB Based on the distribution of an earthquake swarm determined from an ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) network deployed from 20 August to 5 September 2015 in the northernmost part of the South China Sea (SCS) and data from inland seismic stations in Taiwan, we resolved a M-L 4.1 earthquake occurring on 1 September 2015 as a NE-SW-trending left-lateral strike-slip event that ruptured along the pre-existing normal faults generated during the SCS opening phases. The direction of the T-axes derived from the M-L 4.1 earthquake and the background seismicity off SW Taiwan present high consistency, indicating a stable dominant NW-SE tensional stress for the subducted Eurasian Plate (EUP). The distinct stress variations on the two sides of these reactivated NE-SW trending features suggest that the presence of pre-existing normal faults and other related procecses may lessen the lateral resistance between the Taiwan collision and Manila subduction system, and facilitate the slab-pull process for the subducting portion, which may explain the NW-SE tensional stress environment near the transition boundary in the northernmost part of the SCS.

AB The central and northeastern of Turkey were shaped by the transition from collisional to post-collisional tectonics and coeval magmatism during Early Cenozoic. However, the temporal and spatial evolution of the magmatism during the middle Eocene remains elusive. In this paper, we provide petrological, isotopic and radiometric data from two middle Eocene volcano-sedimentary successions, from the northern (Almus) and southern (Yildtzeli) parts of the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan Suture Zone, and discuss their generation in the post-collisional setting. Our results indicate that the volcanic units from these regions display similar stratigraphic and petrological evolution during the narrow window of activity (44.4-44.8 Ma), which is constrained by Ar-Ar dating. The lower parts of the volcano-stratigraphic sections contain hawaiite, and trachybasalts that have a mildly alkaline, nepheline-normative character (Vla subseries), together with clinopyroxene-hornblendite xenoliths. The middle portions of the sections contain basaltic andesitic to dacitic lavas that become tholeiitic/calcalkaline in character (Vlb subseries). In the middle to upper parts of the successions, tholeiitic/calc-alkaline basaltic andesite (V2a subseries) and nepheline-normative mildly alkaline basalts (V2b subseries) become dominant, marking the end of the volcanic episode.
   All of these units display negative high field strength element values, and enriched large-ion lithophile and light rare earth element values, which mimic subduction-related signatures. The Na-rich character, high Ba/Rb and low Rb/Sr ratios, together with FC3MS values (wt.% FeO/CaO-3 * MgO/SiO2), of these series indicate the presence of amphibole and pyroxene minerals in the source area. Also, Dy/Yb values from the most basic suites, Vla and V2b, are supportive of a spinel-bearing source area. Low-degree partial melting (similar to 1-5%) modelling of cumulate clinopyroxene-hornblendite xenoliths in the lava series provided the observed geochemical patterns in our most basic lava samples. Petrological observations indicate that the Vla and Vlb subseries were shaped by fractional crystallization and assimilation-related modifications. In addition, the V2a subseries displays basic magma replenishment, with inversed clinopyroxene cores and mantle/rim transects. The V2b subseries were most likely shaped by fractional crystallization of homogenized basic magma mush.
   Post-collisional magmatism across the region was therefore generated by thinning of the lithospheric mantle during the middle Eocene.

AB The Jiertieke-Zankan area lies in the Taxkorgan region (West Kunlun Mountains) of Xinjiang province, northwestern China. The area contains the largest commercial iron ore belt in the region. Furthermore, this iron ore belt hosts the youngest banded iron formation identified to date (the Jiertieke iron deposit), which was deposited during the Early Cambrian. Previous studies have mainly provided evidence regarding the depositional environment and formational age of this area, but the tectonic setting and geochronology of the ore deposits remains poorly studied. Here, we provide an integrated examination of high-precision SIMS zircon U-Pb dating, along with the major and trace element geochemistry of the metasedimentary rock (a biotite-quartz schist) that host the iron ores. The Jiertieke area is characterized by bedded metapelites that contain detrital zircons as young as 546 Ma, whereas the Zankan area contains metapsammites, in addition to the metapelites, as young as 541 Ma. Multiple detrital zircons age groups ranging from 700-1100 Ma, 1600-1850 Ma, and 2250-2500 Ma, indicate the input of ancient elastic material to the basin. Based on provenance indicators and Nd isotopic data, they suggest that the metasedimentary rocks are the product of an undifferentiated felsic terrain, likely ancient upper continental crust, being eroded. Given the geochronological and geochemical features of the metasedimentary rocks, and previously identified bimodal volcanics within the region, we suggest that the tectonic setting of the Zankan-Jiertieke area was a back-arc rift basin during the Late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian.

However, whether the associated metapelitic rocks also experience UHP metamorphism has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this contribution, we chose two eclogite samples and one metapelite sample to investigate their metamorphic evolution. Combining with petrographic observation and P-T pseudosections, similar clockwise P-T paths with peak stages at 25-34 kbar, 580-633 degrees C were obtained for eclogites and metapelites. Eclogite ZM871 records a prograde metamorphic condition at 21.6 kbar/552 degrees C, defined by the assemblage garnet + omphacite + epidote + lawsonite + talc (+ quartz + phengite + rutile) and a peak metamorphic condition at 34.0 kbar/633 degrees C by the assemblage garnet + omphacite + lawsonite + talc ( + coesite + phengite + rutile). Eclogite ZM641 records a prograde metamorphic condition at 21.5 kbar/520 degrees C, defined by the assemblage garnet + omphacite + glaucophane + lawsonite ( +quartz + phengite + rutile) and a peak condition at 30 kbar/616 degrees C by the assemblage garnet + omphacite + lawsonite + talc ( + quartz + phengite + rutile). Metapelite ZM8-1 records a prograde metamorphic condition at 18.2 kbar/530 degrees C defined by the assemblage garnet + chloritoid + chlorite ( + quartz + phengite + rutile), a peak condition at 25 kbar/580 degrees C by the assemblage garnet + kyanite + chloritoid ( + quartz + phengite + rutile), and a retrograde condition at 16.2 kbar/595-598 degrees C by the assemblage garnet + kyanite + chloritoid + chlorite ( + quartz + phengite + rutile). Combined with previous data from orthogneiss and impure marble in the Yuka terrane, which also recorded UHP metamorphic conditions, the Yuka eclogite-bearing unit commonly underwent UHP metamorphism, although further investigation is warranted to verify whether the Yuka unit represents a single coherent UHP metamorphic terrane or a collage of different UHP metamorphic slices.

AB Crustal thickness and Poisson's ratios were estimated at 13 broadband seismological stations established in a profile along the Kali river valley, Kumaon (Central) Himalaya. The seismological profile extends from the IndoGangetic plain (IGP) in the south to the Higher Himalaya in the north, passing through the Sub and Lesser Himalaya. The Receiver Function (RF) method has been adopted to investigate the crustal structure beneath the profile. Time domain iterative deconvolution method has been adopted for RF computation. The H-k stacking method has been adopted to analyze the RFs for obtaining average crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio (sigma) of the crust beneath each station. The study reveals that the crustal thickness beneath the IGP is similar to 38 km which gradually increases up to similar to 41 km at the northernmost station located in the Higher Himalaya. The values of sigma vary from 0.23 to 0.28. The value of sigma is low in the Sub-Himalaya and outer Lesser Himalaya suggesting more of a felsic composition of crust. A Significantly high value of sigma ( similar to 0.28) is observed in the Dharchula region of the Chiplakot Crystalline belt which is coincident with a large number of micro-to-moderate magnitude earthquakes forming a cluster at shallow to mid-crustal depths. The high Poisson's ratio is possibly due to the presence of fluids/partial melts at mid-crustal depth. The presence of fluids influences the rheological property and controls the mechanical and shear strength of crustal rocks producing a cluster of seismicity observed beneath the Dharchula region.

AB We develop a two-dimensional plane-strain viscoelastoplastic finite element model to simulate the evolutions of displacement, velocity, and strain across the Longmen Shan (LMS) fault Zone during seismic cycles. In this study, we investigate strain partitioning and seismicity in eastern Tibet due to purely crustal shortening, lateral variations in lithospheric viscosity beneath eastern Tibet, the increased lower-crustal flow velocity, and the active Longriba (LRB) fault. Our results show that the accumulated interseismic strain across eastern Tibet is released mainly by the characteristic large earthquakes on the LMS fault, leading to prominent coseismic uplift of eastern Tibet. During the postseismic period, eastern Tibet, especially the LMS region, continues to uplift due to viscoelastic stress relaxation in the middle-lower crust and upper mantle. When a stronger Ahba sub-block or middle-lower crustal flow is considered, the modeled vertical displacement and velocity in the upper crust increase largely in the LMS sub-block, causing more rapid uplift of this region. We also demonstrate that the active LRB fault would accommodate some crustal shortening, repartition the strain in eastern Tibet, and eventually change the seismicity on the LMS fault.

AB A series of NE and NW-trending Cenozoic faulted basins, located at the north margin of the Eastern Qinling Mountains, document Cenozoic intracontinental extension process in Central China. Based on fault kinematic analysis of the faulted basins, coupling with the stratigraphic sequence, we rebuilt a tectonic stress sequence of the faulted basins since the Cenozoic era. Combined with the previous chronological data, we define the Cenozoic faulted basin formation process including two stages of tectonic evolution. The first stage largely presents the NW-SE extensional rifting in a long period from the Paleocene to the Middle-Late Miocene due to northwestward subduction of the Pacific plate. It is marked by the basin occurrence along the north margin of the Eastern Qinling Mountains (e.g., the Sanmenxia, Lushi, Shangluo, and Weihe Basins) in the Paleocene to the Early-Middle Miocene in accordance with a NW-SE extension, and regional basin inversion in the Middle Miocene as the result of a NW-SE compression. The second stage is featured by the three-episode extension since the Middle-Late Miocene, which is probably affected by the combination of the northeastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau and the northwestward subduction of the Pacific Plate. The earliest episode of NW-SE extension caused by regional NE-SW compression in the Late Miocene to Early Pleistocene, which leads to the formation of the Yuncheng Basin. A gentle NE-SW extension subsequently dominated here in the Late Pleistocene, as represented by the widespread appearance of paleo-lakes in the basins. Then the youngest tectonic regime controlled this region, characteristic of a tectonic transpression (ENE-SWS compression and NNW-SSE extension), causing evidently strike-slip activities on the primary faults in the basins.

AB Paleosol carbonates were found in the Erlongkou section at the top of the Changhsing Formation in Chongqing, southwestern China. Detailed petrology study suggested that these paleosol carbonates have typical pedogenic structures and fabrics. Conodont biostratigraphy, volcanic ash zircon dating, and stratigraphic carbon isotopes indicated that the paleosol carbonates formed at the end of Permian (252.3 +/- 1.0 Ma). Geochemical results indicate two different provenances for the paleosol (i.e., the micrite of the Changhsing Formation and volcanic ash). The calcretes and carbonates in the paleosol are pedogenic calcites that precipitated under well-drained conditions, and they are free of carbonate debris from the bedrocks. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations (pCO(2)) estimated based on the model of Cerling (1999) suggested that there was greenhouse paleoclimates with a transient fluctuation in pCO(2) at the end of the Permian.

AB The Kopili fault (KF) zone, is witness to many seismic activities including the 1869 earthquake (7.8 M-s), the 1943 earthquake (7.3 M-s) and recent 2016 earthquake (6.7 M-w) which occurred at certain time intervals. Considerable portion of KF zone and its neighbouring is characterized by alluvial soils which have higher potential of trapping seismic waves. This leads to intense amplification of ground shaking, necessitating a detailed study of subsurface profile beneath KF. The H/V Spectral Ratio of strong-motion recordings is an effective tool to evaluate such nonlinear site responses, and to develop a subsurface velocity profile is an important step toward hazard mitigation. In this work, we used 14 seismic stations, nearby this fault to construct the subsurface profile. This study suggests that H/V ratios obtained from coda portion of seismogram are almost independent of the coda window length. We applied diffuse field concept to produce an inverted S-wave as well as P-wave velocity profile. The inverted profiles show significant correlation with the underlying site class as well as exhibit an excellent match with already reported attenuation quality factors for this region. For few selected sites, inferred velocity estimates become 500 m/s at a depth of 25 m or shallower. Interestingly, it is observed that two nearby receiving sites are characterized by different shear wave velocity profiles at shallower depths. However, in deeper depths, they are found to converge. All results are comprehensively analyzed and their implications are accordingly outlined.

AB A number of Permian to Triassic mafic-ultramafic intrusions along the central Asian orogenic belt (CAOB) host either economically important or potential Ni-Cu sulfide mineralization. These intrusions were proposed to have emplaced in a post-subduction, extensional setting. In this study, we chose rocks from the Poyi, Huangshanxi, Huangshandong, and the Hongqiling No. 2 intrusions in the CAOB that contain olivine and spinel pairs to calculate the fO(2) of magma using olivine-spinel equilibria. The obtained fO(2) of the magmas overall range from FMQ + 0.3 to FMQ + 2.6, much higher than those for MORBs (FMQ-1 to FMQ). In addition, the obtained magma fO(2) of the Poyi intrusion is progressively elevated with the decrease of Fo contents of olivine. The fO(2) of the mantle source of the Hongqiling No.2 intrusion in the eastern part of the CAOB was calculated to be similar to FMQ + 0.5 with the compositions of olivine and spinel during partial melting of the mantle being simulated by an inverse model. The fO(2) of the mantle source of the Poyi intrusion in the western part of the CAOB was calculated to be similar to FMQ + 0.3 using the ultramafic rocks containing Fo(90-91) olivine in the intrusion. In addition, the V/Sc of the mantle peridotite and basalts from Paleozoic (533-260 Ma) ophiolites in the CAOB yielded the fO(2) of FMQ-1.5 to FMQ, which can be taken as the fO(2) of the mantle either prior to or after the closure of the paleo-Asian ocean. The calculated fO(2) for the mantle sources of the two intrusions are slightly higher than the upper fO(2) limit of the mantle sources (FMQ-1.5 to FMQ) obtained from Paleozoic ophiolites in the CAOB and the mantle sources for MORBs (FMQ-2.5 to FMQ). Permian to Triassic Ni-Cu sulfide-bearing, mafic-ultramafic intrusions in the CAOB are therefore considered to have formed from relatively oxidized mafic magmas that may have been derived from the metasomatized mantle sources. The magmas may have become more oxidized with the fractionation process until they were reduced by organic-rich crustal components to reach sulfide saturation, forming economically important Ni-Cu sulfide deposits.

AB We performed field investigations to reconstruct the paleoearthquake history of eastern segment of the Altyn Tagh fault, NW China. Investigation at the Saohu spring trench and Shibaocheng west trench sites result in the identification three well-resolved earthquakes, designated as events E-1, E-2, and E-3, within the last similar to 7000 years. Radiocarbon dates of detrital charcoal provide constraints on the timing of faulting events. The most recent surface-rupturing earthquake, event E-1 dated between 2720 and 2800 years (a) before present (BP), had a rupture length of similar to 83 km, extending from Hongliuxia to Bagexia, with a coseismic displacement of about 4.5 m. The penultimate event, E-2, occurred between 4180 and 4970 a BP and may have ruptured from Subei to Bagexia with a coseismic displacement of > 7 m. The third youngest event, E-3, occurred approximately 6440-7180 a BP and may have ruptured the whole segment from Subei to Kuantan mountain, with a coseismic displacement of > 10 m. Holocene earthquake recurrence behavior on the eastern segment of the Altyn Tagh fault conforms to a variable slip earthquake model. Together with previous studies of slip rate, the huge displacement deficit along the eastern segment indicates a high earthquake risk for the surrounding region; the fault has the potential to trigger earthquakes of greater than M7.8, or a period of clustered earthquake activity. The displacement deficit could also indicate that sub-faults in the western Qilian Mountains have absorbed more lateral extrusion of the plateau during the Holocene, which would result in a decreasing fault slip rate and weakening of the eastern extension or outward expansion of the Altyn Tagh fault.

TI 3D joint inversion of gravity data and Rayleigh wave group velocities to

AB In this study, we developed a method to invert jointly Rayleigh wave group velocities and gravity anomalies for velocity and density structure of the lithosphere. We applied the method to the Makran accretionary prism, SE Iran. The reason for using different data sets is that each of these data sets is sensitive to different parameters. Surface wave group velocities are sensitive mainly to shear wave velocity distribution in depth but do not well resolve density variations. Therefore, joint inversion with gravity data increases the resolution of density distribution. Our approach differs from others mainly in the model parameterization: Instead of subdividing the model into a large number of thin layers, we invert for the properties of only four layers: thickness, P- and S-wave velocities and densities and their vertical gradients in sediments, upper-crust, lower-crust and upper mantle. The method is applied first to synthetic models in order to demonstrate its usefulness. We then applied the method to real data to investigate the lithosphere structure beneath the Makran. The resulting model shows that Moho depth increases from Oman Sea (18-33 km) and Makran fore-arc (33-37 km) to the volcanic-arc (44-46 km). The crustal density is high in the Oman Sea as should be expected for the oceanic crust. We also find a high-velocity anomaly in the upper mantle under the Oman Sea corresponding to the subducting slab. The crust under the fore-arc, volcanic-arc and back-arc settings of Makran subduction zone is characterized by low-velocity zones.

AB This article presents first tephrochronological data on the volcanic activity in the valley of the Jom-Bolok River (East Sayan Mountains, Siberia), which is the largest manifestation of the Holocene eruptions in Central Asia. The data results from our study of the proglacial Kaskadnoe-1 Lake situated near the Jom-Bolok basalt field. The lake sediments include a series of tephra-rich layers. Radiocarbon dating of the lake sediments provided a robust age model which allowed us to build timing of eruptions formed the Jom-Bolok volcanic field. We recognize two large phases of volcanism separated by almost 5 thousand years dormant phase. The first phase is traced back to ca. 14.3 cal ka BP and lasted until 6.3 cal ka BP. Ten clusters of microtephra layers in the sediments of the first phase show 300-800 years recurrence of the volcanic events weakening upward. The event of 14.3-13.3 cal ka BP probably represents the strongest eruptions of the Jom-Bolok. The second phase started ca. 1.6 cal ka BP and highly likely continues in our days. Its strongest eruptions occurred between 1.6 and 0.8 cal ka BP with periodicity of 200 years. This tephrostratigraphy shows a multiplicity of the Jom-Bolok volcanic events and amplifies the earlier built scheme resulted from investigations of the stratified basalts, pyroclasts and lake damming events. Additionally, we indicate a possible influence of the Jom-Bolok volcanic activity on the regional and global climatic changes.

AB The Ning (Nanjing city)-Wu (Wuhu City) volcanic basin, which is famous for its large-scale, high-grade ore deposits, is a typical iron ore district in the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River Metallogenic Belt (MLRYMB). The southern part of the basin is primarily covered by Quaternary strata. Few in depth studies have been conducted on this area. Due to the increasing demand for mineral resources and the controversy over regional tectonic models, some fundamental geological issues still need to be addressed. These questions include defining the characteristics of the geological structures and the mineralization prospects. Therefore, a three-dimensional (3D) magnetotelluric survey was conducted in this area to obtain a deep 3D electrical model. It was found that the Yangtze fault (CJF) and the main thrust fault (MTF) in the upper crust have the same deep (middle crust to upper mantle) setting and part of the thrust tectonics of the metallogenic belt. The southern boundary of the Ning-Wu Basin is located on a fault belt (boundary fault, BF) with a northeast-east (or east-west) strike influenced by the MTF in the southern part of the study area. Bounded by the BF and MTF, the southeastern part of the study area exhibits signs of uplift. With the recent discovery of a large porphyry copper deposit to the southeastern part of the study area, which is located in an uplift structure similar to the one south of the Ning-Wu Basin, this local uplift could have potential mineralization prospects based on a previous mineralization theory developed for this belt.

AB The Salin Sub-Basin is a well-known Cenozoic hydrocarbon-rich basin in central Myanmar, and contains a succession of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The analytical results of petrographic and whole-rock geochemical data indicate that the sandstone sequences in the Salin Sub-Basin were derived mainly from at least three different provenances: the Western Myanmar Arc, the Myanmar terrane basement, and the westerly Indo-Myanmar (Burman) Ranges (IMR), where sediments were subjected to initial-intermediate weathering conditions and rapid erosions, and were finally transported to the studied area. Based on the comparison of the geochemical variations between the Salin Sub-Basin in Myanmar and Sylhet Basin in Bangladesh, the provenance terranes of these two sedimentary basins were found to be significantly different from each other. This is most likely due to the rising of IMR and the IMR probably acts as the barrier between the Salin Sub-Basin in the East and Sylhet Basin in the west, and prevents influences of Myanmar sediment sources on the Sylhet Basin. As a result of major and trace-element tectonic setting discrimination diagrams and geochemical parameters, sedimentation in the studied area was likely to occur at the Continental Island Arc (CIA) setting under a well- oxygenated condition. It was most probably formed under the site of a fore-arc setting associated with the India-Asia convergence and collisional processes.

AB Jurassic adakitic rocks in the southern Lhasa subterrane are relatively rare, poorly documented, and their pet-rogenesis and geodynamic setting are unclear. To explore these issues, we present zircon U-Pb ages along with Hf isotopic, whole-rock geochemical, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data for hornblende quartz diorite porphyry (HQDP) and quartz diorite porphyry (QDP) in the Ruocuo area, southern margin of the Lhasa terrane, Tibet. Zircon U-Pb dating for these rocks indicates that they were emplaced in the Early-Middle Jurassic (182-170 Ma). Geochemically, HQDP and QDP both show characteristics of adakites, with intermediate SiO2 (60.62-65.63 wt% and 57.46-60.04 wt%, respectively), relatively high Al2O3 (14.23-18.23 wt% and 18.32-20.14 wt%, respectively) and Sr (344-571 ppm and 514-614 ppm, respectively), and low Y (9.12-13.0 ppm and 11.0-14.9 ppm, respectively) and Yb (0.93-1.31 ppm and 1.08-1.52 ppm, respectively). In addition, they show relatively low ratios of (Sr-87/ Sr-86)(i) (0.7038-0.7045) (Pb-206/Pb-204)(i) (18.31-18.42), (Pb-20(7)/(208) Pb)(i) (15.56-15.66), and (Pb-208/Pb-204)(i) (38.36-38.77) and relatively high values of epsilon Nd (t) ( + 5.54 to + 6.33) and epsilon(Hf) (t) ( + 11.8 to + 17.3). The Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes of HQDP and QDP are similar to those of the Yarlung Tsangpo ophiolites, indicating that they were predominantly generated by the partial melting of the subducted Neo-Tethys oceanic slab. The subducted Neo-Tethys oceanic slab-derived adakitic rocks that are present in the southern Lhasa subterrane provide strong evidence for proving the presence of oceanic subduction during the Early-Middle Jurassic. By combining our results with the previously reported results, we suggest that the Ruocuo adakitic rocks and Early Mesozoic (Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic) magmatic rocks in the southern Lhasa subterrane formed in a magmatic arc setting related to the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethys oceanic slab, that the initial subduction of the Neo-Tethys oceanic slab occurred prior to the Early Jurassic, and that the upwelling asthenosphere, triggered by the roll-back of the subducted Neo-Tethys oceanic slab, provided the heat that was required for slab melting. However, contrasting these results with the geochemical characteristics of the No. 2 deposit in the Xiongcun Cu-Au district leads us to consider that the Early-Middle Jurassic subducted oceanic slab-derived adakitic porphyries contain a greater potential for porphyry Cu-Au mineralization than the Early Mesozoic normal magmatic rocks in the southern Lhasa subterrane. Furthermore, mineralized Jurassic porphyry has been reported in the Ruocuo area, adjacent to the northern Xigaze forearc basin, indicating that the northern Xigaze forearc basin also has the potential for subduction-related porphyry Cu-Au mineralization.

AB The Taipingzhen deposit is a newly discovered REE deposit in the North Qinling Orogen (NQO), Central China. The REE ores are hosted in the altered fracture zones of Paleozoic strata and a granitic intrusion. The ore minerals mainly include bastnasite-(Ce)[(Ce(CO3)F], parisite-(Ce)[CaCe2(CO3)(3)F-2], and synchysite-(Ce)[CaCe (CO3)(2)F], and this deposit also contains some uncommon minerals, such as tornebohmite-(Ce)[Ce2Al(SiO4)(2)(OH)], gatelite-(Ce) [CaCe3AlAl2Mg(Si2O7)(SiO4)(3)O(OH)(2)], fluocerite-(La)[LaF3] and F-rich cerite-(Ce) [(Ce,Ca)(9) Mg(SiO4)(3)[SiO3(OH)](4)F-3], which are identified here for the first time in China. To determine the timing of REE mineralization and explore possible genetic relationships between mineralization and granitic magmatism, the U-Pb ages of bastnasite-(Ce) from ore and zircon from ore-hosting granite are obtained. The in situ LA-MC-ICP-MS U-Pb age of the bastriasite-(Ce) provides a reliable U-238/(206)pb-(207)pb/Pb-206 lower intersection point age of 409 +/- 16 Ma, and ID-TIMS analyses yield an U-Pb age of 407.8 +/- 3.3 Ma; the U-Pb dating of the magmatic zircon reveals that the wall rock was emplaced at 457.1 +/- 4.9 Ma, and the hydrothermal zircon age of 399.4 +/- 3.5 Ma records the time of hydrothermal alteration, thus indicating that the REE mineralization in the Taipingzhen deposit occurred at approximately 409-400 Ma. This age coincides well with the U-Pb ages of the bastnasite-(Ce) and zircon, revealing a genetic association between the hydrothermal fluid and the REE mineralization. The Hf isotopic compositions imply that the partial melting of Paleoproterozoic HP and UHP eclogite from the lower crust provided ore materials for the mineralization, and the deposit was generated in a retrograde metamorphic setting during the late Paleozoic postcollisional extension event in the NQO. Furthermore, combined with the geochronological data published for other U-REE metallic deposits in the NQO, our study indicates that the late Silurian-early Devonian granite-related U-REE metallic mineralization throughout the NQO mainly occurred during 421-395 Ma.

AB Earth fissures are geological hazards that frequently occur all over the world and greatly threaten the safety of people's property and lives. This paper reports a case from a typical agricultural town in the Weihe watershed, northwest (NW) of China, Dali, which has been severely affected from earth fissures in recent years. A comprehensive survey was made on the geometric characteristics of the earth fissures developed in the study area through field investigations, trial trenches, boreholes, exploratory wells, and laboratory tests. The study indicates that fourteen nearly parallel fissures have developed in the area, with a fissure to fissure space of 140-350 m, and a maximum length of any of the given fissures of 500 m. The underlying faults, loess joints, and the Quaternary unconsolidated and collapsible sedimentary loess provide a favorable geological condition for the occurrence of the earth fissures. From 2003 to 2012, the groundwater level in the area rose about three meters due to agricultural irrigation and leakage of a water diversion canal. Collapsible deformation occurred in the loess, while seepage erosion expanded the original joints in the soil. The earth fissures occurred resulting from multiple geological environmental forces and human activities.

AB Potholes carved into streambeds of the Jurassic and Cretaceous sandstone and mudstone along the Sunxi River (Chongqing, China) have been carefully investigated in order to characterize the geometrical features of the potholes and to explore their implications for river incision into bedrock. The potholes formed by gyratory currents through abrasion are characterized by an average aperture aspect-ratio (a/b) of similar to 1.2 and a mean diameter-to-depth ratio (D/h) of similar to 1.0. The most parsimonious model for the h-D relationship over the full range of data is a linear equation in which 2 parameters (n is the slope of the line and m is the D-intercept) are essentially controlled by hydrodynamics. Data of the Sunxi River yield that n = 0.71 +/- 0.18, indicating that the pothole deepening was faster than the pothole widening by a quasi-constant factor of similar to 1.4 during abrasive erosion as the dominant mechanism of pothole development in bedrocks of sandstone interbedded with mudstone. Them value, which varies from 5.9 cm to 11.0 cm, apparently depends on hydrodynamics at each locality, and can be inferred as the dimensional threshold of initial depressions from which potholes grew by deepening and lateral expanding. The potholes with D/h = 1 are prone to entrap and retain coarser sediments which are more effective for pothole growth. The bedrock weakened significantly by coalescence of numerous potholes is easily broken, detached, and removed by flooding (truncation). The cyclic pothole-truncation process is particularly important for incision of bedrock channels and thus landscape evolution of mountain ranges in response to tectonic uplift and climate change.

AB Seven continuous GPS stations are located on the hanging wall of the Longmenshan Thrust Belt, and post-seismic deformation data of the 2013 Lushan earthquake have been recorded for nearly four years following the earthquake. We transform the data from a global reference frame to the South China Block reference frame, and then, the secular motion and post-seismic deformation of the Wenchuan earthquake are excluded using an exponential fit model. Based on our results, the viscosities of the low velocity zone at a depth of similar to 25 km and of the middle and lower crust around the Longmenshan Thrust Belt are obtained as 2.75 x 10(17) Pa.s and 2.56 x 10(18) Pa.s, respectively. The post-seismic rebound, which was observed near the Lushan epicenter, may represent the occurrence of overslip during the earthquake. The more complex structural style may have produced weaker fault activity along the southern segment of the Longmenshan Thrust Belt than along its middle and northern segments.

AB We study the initial rupturing process of the 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake occurred on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, using the back-projection method and the P-wave phases recorded by a near-source seismic array deployed in the Zipingpu reservoir region. We first use the P-wave first arrivals and the back-projection method to relocate the initial rupturing position of the Wenchuan earthquake. The results show that the initial rupture of the Wenchuan earthquake is located at 31.014 degrees N +/- 0.003 degrees and 103.391 degrees E +/- 0.003 degrees with a focal depth of 8.4 km +/- 0.82 km, at 14:27:58.800 +/- 0.4 s on 12 May 2008 (hereafter, the time mention are Beijing time = GMT + 8). Then we use the back-projection method to obtain a detailed initial rupture process in the three-dimensional space surrounding the relocated hypocenter. The rupturing images indicate that the initial rupture propagated downward and southwestward firstly and then it moved upward and northeastward with an average speed of 2.7 km/s in the initial stage. The deduced initial rupturing process of the Wenchuan earthquake is consistent with the pre-slip model and the depth of the nucleation zone was around 7.5-9.5 km.

AB Microcystin-LR (MCLR) is a cyanotoxin produced by blue-green algae that causes liver and kidney toxicities. MCLR toxicity is dependent on cellular uptake through the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporters. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progresses through multiple stages, alters expression of hepatic OATPs, and is associated with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether NAFLD increases systemic exposure to MCLR and influences acute liver and kidney toxicities. Rats were fed a control diet or two dietary models of NAFLD; methionine and choline deficient (MCD) or high fat/high cholesterol (HFHC). Two studies were performed in these groups: 1) a single dose intravenous toxicokinetic study (20 pg/kg), and 2) a single dose intraperitoneal toxicity study (60 mu g/kg). Compared to control rats, plasma MCLR area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in MCD rats doubled, whereas biliary clearance (Cl-bil) was unchanged; in contrast, plasma AUC in HFHC rats was unchanged, whereas Cl-bil approximately doubled. Less MCLR bound to PP2A was observed in the liver of MCD rats. This shift in exposure decreased the severity of liver pathology only in the MCD rats after a single toxic dose of MCLR (60 mu g/kg). In contrast, the single toxic dose of MCLR increased hepatic inflammation, plasma cholesterol, proteinuria, and urinary KIM1 in HFHC rats more than MCLR exposed control rats. In conclusion, rodent models of NAFLD alter MCLR toxicokinetics and acute toxicity and may have implications for liver and kidney pathologies in NAFLD patients.

AB The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-met pathway, which mainly consists of HGF activator (HGFA) and its substrate HGF, protects various types of cells via anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory signals. Thrombin is the main physiological activator of such plasmatic pathway, and increased plasma concentrations of HGF have been considered as a molecular marker for some pathological conditions, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Since thrombin generation is often linked to tissue injury, and these events are common during snake venom-induced consumption coagulopathies (VICC), our goals were to examine whether Bothrops jararaca venom (Bjv), which induces VICC in vivo: (i) activates the HGF/c-met pathway in vivo and (ii) cleaves zymogen forms of HGFA and HGF (proHGFA and proHGF, respectively) in vitro. Two experimental groups (n = 6, each) of male adult Wistar rats were subcutaneously injected with 500 mu L of 0.9% NaCl solution (control) or sub-lethal doses (1.6 mg/kg) of Bjv. Three hours after envenomation, whole blood samples were collected from the carotid arteries to evaluate relevant coagulation parameters using rotational thromboelastometry and fibrinogen level (colorimetric assay). Additionally, the plasma concentration of HGF was assayed (ELISA). Thromboelastometric assays showed that blood clotting and fibrin polymerization were severely impaired 3 h after Bjv injection. Total plasma HGF concentrations were almost 6-fold higher in the Bjv-injected group (410.0 +/- 91) compared with control values (68 +/- 18 pg/mL, p < 0.05). Western blotting assay showed that Bjv processed proHGFA and proHGF, generating bands resembling those generated by thrombin and kallikrein, respectively. In contrast to the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), the metalloprotease inhibitor ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (Na-2-EDTA) strongly reduced the ability of Bjv to process proHGFA and generated one active band similar to that of thrombin. Since Bjv contains prothrombin and factor X activators, increased intravascular thrombin formation might partly explain the increased HGF levels after bothropic envenomation. In conclusion, these findings suggest that snake venom metalloproteases may be determinant for elevation of plasma levels of HGF in rats experimentally envenomated with Bjv.

ID MOLECULAR EVOLUTION
AB Pseudoscorpions are very small arthropods with almost worldwide distribution. They possess a unique venom delivery system in the chelal hands of their pedipalps that has evolved independently from that of scorpions and spiders. Studies on the venom composition of pseudoscorpions are very rare. Recently, the potential venom composition of the pseudoscorpion Synsphyronus apimelus Harvey, 1987 (Pseudoscorpiones: Garypidae) has been studied by transcriptome analysis. However, a proteome analysis of venom to identify the genuine venom compounds of pseudoscorpions has not yet been performed. In our study, we have developed a non-invasive approach for extracting minute amounts of venom, which for the first time allowed collecting pure venom samples of pseudoscorpions with minimal contaminations and high reproducibility. These experiments first required a morphological investigation of the venom delivery system with a focus on the role of the lamina defensor in the release of venom. Likely, the venom delivery system of pseudoscorpions has a mechanism that prevents the release of venom if the prey is not successfully penetrated by a venom tooth. Electrical stimulation of a gland-containing chelal hand in combination with a mechanical stimulation of the lamina defensor at the base of the venom tooth resulted in an average of 5 nl of collected venom. The utility of the method was then validated by repeated venom extractions and subsequent analysis of the venom composition using MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting. Subsequent proteomics analysis in combination with transcriptome analyses of chelal hand tissue has identified the first genuine venom compounds of pseudoscorpions with putative antimicrobial peptides. For our experiments, we used the house pseudoscorpion Chelifer cancroides (Linnaeus, 1758) (Pseudoscorpiones: Cheliferidae).

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a grape seed byproduct to mitigate the harmful damage produced by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) at systemic level in plasma and liver as well as at local level in the gastrointestinal tract in weaned piglets. Twenty four crossbred pigs (TOPIG) were randomly assigned to one of four experimental diets: 1)- control diet (normal compound feed for starter piglets without mycotoxin), 2)- AFB1 diet (compound feed contaminated with 320 ppb pure AFB1), 3)- GS diet (compound feed including 8% of grape seed meal), 4)- AFB1 + GS diet (compound feed containing 8% of grape seed meal contaminated with 320 ppb AFB1) for 30 days. The results showed that pigs fed AFB1 diet had altered performance (-25.1%), increased the thiobarbituric substances (TBARS) concentration wile reduced total antioxidant capacity and activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD and GPx) in plasma and organs. AFB1 produced a dual effect on inflammatory response by increasing the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in liver and colon and decreasing these cytokines in duodenum. The inclusion of grape seed in the diet of AFB1 intoxicated pigs enhanced the antioxidant enzymes activity, decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines and TBARS level and ameliorated the growth performance of AFB1-treated animals. These findings suggest that grape waste is a promising feed source in counteracting the harmful effect of aflatoxin B1.

AB Lonomia obliqua is a caterpillar of potential therapeutic interest whose venom is able to induce severe blood leakage and modulate leukocyte migration. Since both phenotypes are associated with changes in cytoskeleton dynamics and cell adhesion properties, the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of Lonomia obliqua bristle extract (LOBE) in cell adhesion and migration signaling. Proteomic analysis revealed that epithelial cells (CHO-K1) exposed to LOBE (30 mu g/mL, 30 min) exhibited changes in levels of actin regulatory proteins, including RhoGTPases. These changes correlated with an increase in the activity of the RhoGTPase family member Rac as measured by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). When plated in migration promoting conditions, CHO-Kl cells exposed to LOBE (10 mu g/mL) showed an increase in membrane ruffling after short (30 min) period of incubation that was accompanied by changes in the distribution of the adhesion markers paxillin, vinculin and an increase of focal adhesion kinase autophosphorylation levels (Y397), suggesting changes in cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion properties and signaling. These data suggest that LOBE possesses bioactive molecules that are capable to modulated cell migration signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics and cell-ECM properties of several cell types.

AB A total of 86 proven cases of Tomodon dorsatus bites admitted to Hospital Vital Brazil (HVB) of Butantan Institute, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, between 1945 and 2018, were retrospectively analyzed. The cases included were those in which the snake was brought to HVB and was correctly identified. Of the 86 cases of snake bites, it was possible to describe the sex of the snake in 52 cases; 31 (59.6%) snakes were male. Only 52 snakes out of 86 could be studied because of their preservation status. The length of snakes (snout-vent length) ranged from 180 to 770 mm. Of the 86 snakes, 72 could be distinguished as adults (n = 63, 87.5%) or juveniles (n = 9, 12.5%). Most bites occurred in the spring and summer seasons (n = 57, 66.3%) and during warmer periods of the day (n = 61, 72.6%), between 9 A.M. and 3 P.M.
   The mean (+/- standard deviation) age of the victims was 26.9 +/- 17.2 years, and 60 (69.8%) were men. Approximately 90% of the patients sought medical care within 6 h after the bite. Both upper (n = 45, 52.3%) and lower (n = 37, 43.0%) limbs were the most frequently bitten, particularly the feet and hands (n = 54, 62.8%). The local clinical manifestations were pain (n = 55, 64.0%), transitory bleeding (n = 23, 26.7%), erythema (n = 22, 25.6%), edema (n = 14, 16.3%), paresthesia (n = 9, 10.5%), and ecchymosis (n = 3, 3.5%). Only 10 (11.6%) patients reported non-specific systemic symptoms characterized by transient dizziness or mild headache, and 21 (24.4%) patients showed no evidence of envenomation. A 20 min whole blood clotting test was performed in 31 (36.0%) patients on admission and all of them had coagulable blood. Supportive treatment was offered to 38 (44.2%) patients, namely, antiseptic (n = 20, 23.3%), antihistamines (n = 12, 14.0%), and analgesics (n = 9, 10.5%). Four (4.7%) patients were inappropriately treated with Bothrops antivenom before their admission to HVB. No sequelae or relevant complications were observed in patients, and the prognosis was benign. Therefore, although T. dorsatus bites can cause mild local symptomatology, it is important that health professionals know how to make the correct diagnosis to avoid unnecessary use of antivenom.

AB Mycotoxins are natural compounds produced as secondary metabolites by mold fungi belonging mainly to the Fusarium family, commonly found on plants such as corn or small grains in the temperate climate zone. One of these mycotoxins is zearalenone, which is classified as a xenoestrogen, an exogenous compound which resembles the structure of naturally occurring estrogens with its chemical structure. This property of zearalenone determines its ability to bind to estrogen receptors of cell and its bioaccumulation. This leads to disorders of the hormonal balance of the body, which in consequence may lead to numerous diseases of reproductive system such as prostate, ovarian, cervical or breast cancers. High risk posed by long-term exposure to contaminated food forces the modem science to develop and implement effective methods of zearalenone neutralisation. This work is a review of current state of knowledge on toxic effects of zearalenone, its metabolism in biological systems and proposed methods of its neutralisation.

AB Because of its bitter taste, quinine elicits strong antifeedant and toxic effects in animals including arthropods. In the present study, two mantis, Sphodromantis viridis, Hierodula membranacea, and two spider species, Nephila edulis, Selenocosmia javanensis, were offered a quinine solution or prey (crickets) contaminated or injected with quinine, which they ingested and survived without apparent toxic symptoms. Analysis of their faeces and, in the case of spiders, of silk from their web revealed that quinine was excreted over a period of 8-12 (mantids) or 7 days (spiders). Interestingly, the silk glands of the spiders served as an additional excretory organ of quinine. Both, mantids and spiders were shown to tolerate high amounts of quinine in their prey. Obviously, the bitter taste of this compound is not perceived by their gustatory receptors and consequently triggers no aversive reactions.

AB This study investigated the biogas (hydrogen and methane) production and microbial community dynamics in the anaerobic treatment of saline industrial effluents containing mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) as a major pollutant. An immobilized sludge anaerobic baffled reactor (ISABR) inoculated with salt-adapted mixed culture was developed as a lab-scale experiment, and effects of operational conditions (e.g., salinity, organic loading rates (OLRs), and temperature) on the system performance were examined. First, different OLRs of 0.64-2.34 gCOD/ L/d, by increasing the initial MEG concentrations at a fixed hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4.5 d, were examined from day 1 to 100 at lower salinity of 10 gNaCl/L and ambient temperature (25 +/- 6 degrees C). Under such operational conditions, maximum methane yield (MY) of 165 mL CH4/gCOD(add) and hydrogen yield (HY) of 102 mL H-2/gCOD(add) were achieved at the lowest OLR of 0.64 gCOD/L/d. Afterwards, impacts of higher salinities of 15-25 gNaCl/L were investigated from day 101 to 208 at a controlled mesophilic temperature of 35 degrees C and fixed OLR (0.64 gCOD/L/d). As a result, enhanced HY and MY (similar to 2-fold) at elevated salinities up to 25 gNaCl/L were obtained. Moreover, the compartment-wise water and gas analyses, for both experiments, revealed that hydrogen and methane peaked in former and latter compartments, respectively, and the peak location shifted depending on overall imposed OLR. The relative abundance of dominant salt-tolerant bacterial genus Desulfovibrio increased when OLR and operational temperature were increased, while dominant archaeal genera responded substantially when temperature was increased. Economic feasibility of ISABR for bioenergy recovery and treatment of MEG was evaluated by a cost-benefit analysis, suggesting that salinity level along with suitable operational temperature substantially affects the maximum net profit.

AB The need of the hour in present world scenario is to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and environmental pollution whilst satisfying the world energy demands. The most promising and readily available source of energy over the whole world is solar energy. One of the ways of taping this energy into useful energy is using Concentrated Photovoltaic Thermal systems. The paper presents the advanced comprehensive review on the design components of Concentrated Photovoltaic Thermal, heat transfer medium, recent application area such as Tissue Dyeing, domestic hot water, Organic Rankine Cycle, and the economic aspect of the Concentrated Photovoltaic Thermal system. Furthermore, the review paper simplifies the classification into two systems namely thermally coupled and thermally decoupled systems. Concentrated Photovoltaic Thermal shows potential to deliver better gains compared to Concentrated Photovoltaic, Photovoltaic and Photovoltaic Thermal. But matching the different components like the heat transfer component and the medium for specific use is an area that requires research. Therefore, this review concentrates more on the advantages and limitations of using different heat transfer components and heat transfer medium. The benefits of this paper would be the understanding of the components of the heat transport system like fins, microchannel, storage tank and underground heat exchangers and the fluid used in the Concentrated Photovoltaic Thermal integrated system like water, air, nanofluids, Phase Change Materials. It is found that the heat transfer device performance is limited due to its large area, thermal losses, mirror effect on the thermal and electrical efficiencies, and the temperature difference between the sink and device. Likewise, the performance of the heat transfer fluid is dependent on the mass flow rate, thermal mass, viscosity, density, time and the required temperature. Finally, for economic feasibility of the Concentrated Photovoltaic Thermal system requires the need for a grid connected system with properly sized system with feed-in-tariff and carbon incentives. Furthermore, the recommendation for heat transfer device, medium and economic aspect is also presented. However, more experimental research is required to further understand the compatibility of each components with Concentrating Photovoltaic Thermal System as presented in way forward.

AB In this work, four kinds of pretreatment methods including microwave-assisted ZnCl2 center dot 4H(2)O or NaOH pretreatment, traditional electrical heating ZnCl2 center dot 4H(2)O or NaOH pretreatment were developed and compared for eucalyptus hydrolysis at 100 degrees C. The effect of various pretreatment methods on hemicellulose and lignin degradation, and as well as subsequent pretreated solids enzymatic saccharification were completely investigated. The results showed that microwave-assisted ZZnCl(2)center dot 4H(2)O pretreatment was highly successful for enhancing eucalyptus enzymatic saccharification due to the removal of hemicellulose and the change of cellulose crystal structure. The pretreatment time can be significantly shortened from 90 min to 20 min by using microwave irradiation as a heating manner, which means energy saving. The addition of Tween 80 into enzymatic hydrolysis step could remarkably reduce the cellulase dosage while the glucose yields do not decrease. The highest glucose yield of this work was 35.7 g/100 g raw material, which represented 90.6% glucose in eucalyptus feedstock. It could be concluded that combination of ZnCl2 center dot 4H(2)O and microwave irradiation provided an applicable strategy for enhancing sugars release from eucalyptus.

AB In this article, water and TiO2-H2O nanofluids are used as heat exchange mediums. The heat transfer and resistance coefficient of corrugated tubes with different corrugation pitches are studied by experimental method. The economy of experimental system is evaluated from the aspects of quantity and quality of energy by thermal and exergy efficiencies respectively. The heat transfer performance of nanofluids in the smooth tube can be enhanced by 2.64-16.9% compared with water under the same working conditions, while the corrugated tubes can improve the heat transfer performance by 4.8-66.3%. When the mass fraction of the nanofluid is 0.5%, the corrugated tubes with different corrugation pitches can increase the heat transfer by 36.3% (P = 6 mm), 40.3% (P = 4 ram) and 44.5% (P = 2 mm) respectively. For thermal efficiency, the results prove that when the Reynolds number is larger than 6000, the comprehensive evaluation indexes of corrugated tubes are much larger than that of smooth tube, and the maximum can reach 1.5637. For exergy efficiency, the research results show that the exergy efficiency of the smooth tube is better than that of the corrugated tubes.

AB Fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid system is a potential field of investigation. This study establishes a modeling and optimization framework for a novel hybrid system consisting of a solid oxide fuel cell, a gas turbine and a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle. Based on the proposed thermodynamical model, a parametric analysis is investigated to determine the impacts of several key parameters on the system exergoeconomic performance. Meanwhile, bi-objective optimization is conducted for maximizing the exergy efficiency and minimizing the levelized cost of electricity via the Epsilon-constraint approach. The Linear Programming Techniques for Multidimensional Analysis of Preference decision-making approach is further employed to select the Pareto optimum solution from Pareto frontiers. The results show that several extreme values for the exergy efficiency and the levelized cost of electricity exist in a series of sensitivity curves, respectively. The Pareto frontiers indicates that with the increase of the exergy efficiency, the levelized cost of electricity shows a moderately increasing trend at first and increases rapidly afterward. Overall, at the Pareto optimum solution, the combined system can achieve an optimal exergy efficiency and levelized cost of electricity by 68% and 0.0575 $ kWh(-1),( )respectively.

AB In this study, microwave assisted NaOH pretreatment of wheat straw was thoroughly investigated using central composite design (CCD) under varying operating variables. i.e. pretreatment time, temperature and NaOH concentration. The crystallinity, crystalline length, surface microstructural change, functional group change and compositional analysis of both optimally pretreated and untreated wheat straw samples were studied. Microbial hydrolysis by Bacillus sp. BMP01 and bioethanol production was also tested for the optimally pretreated wheat straw sample. The pretreatment condition at 160 degrees C, 1.5% NaOH concentration and 15 min preserved high cellulose and removed high amount of lignin. At this point 38.34% of hemicellulose and 74.15% of cellulose were preserved in the solid residue and 69.49% of lignin was solubilized. An overall increase in crystallinity (from 0.3780 to 0.5610) and crystalline length (from 2.51 to 4.83 mu) were observed after the pretreatment process. Mathematical models were developed to predict the lignin removal, cellulose preserved and hemicellulose solubilization during microwave assisted NaOH pretreatment process. 718 mg/g of reducing sugar was released after hydrolysis pretreated wheat straw by Bacillus sp. BMP01. Ethanol yield of 68.2% was obtained after 96 h of fermentation. It was found that the combination of microwave assisted NaOH pretreatment at optimal condition coupled with microbial hydrolysis and C5 and C6 fermenting microbes enhanced reducing sugar and ethanol yields.

AB High-temperature adsorptive heat transformer for steam generation has been experimentally investigated by introducing composite zeolite/CaCl2-water working pair based on a direct contact method. Composite adsorbents are prepared by immersing zeolite into different mass concentrations of CaCl2 solutions. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) is used to observe the surface structure of the composite zeolite. XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) is selected to analyze the element mass ratios in adsorbents. BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller models) is employed to calculate the pore characteristic of pores inside zeolite. Characterization results confirm the success of preparation for composite zeolite. Adsorption properties including equilibrium water uptake and integral adsorption heat are measured for basic evaluation. Overall volumetric adsorption heat is increased by 13.1% for CA40% (immersion of zeolite in CaCl2 solution concentration at 40%) compared with that for 13X. Cyclic experiments are conducted to test the design of system. Superheated steam above 200 degrees C is generated for 13X and different composite zeolites from hot water below 80 degrees C. Dry gas at 130 degrees C is used for regeneration. Gross temperature lift is more than 100 degrees C for single stage zeolite adsorptive heat transformer. Dynamic steam generation on interface between water and zeolite is enhanced with more heat released by using composite zeolite. Subsequently, adsorption equilibrium is easier to be achieved inside the whole range of the packed bed. Effective time ratio for steam generation is elevated by 18.6% for CA40% compared with that for 13X. Mass of generated steam is raised by 12.9% simultaneously. Both the time and mass of generated steam have been obviously promoted with the increase of CaCl2 impregnated in zeolite. COPex (Exergy Coefficient of Performance) is kept constant while SHP (Specific Heating Power for steam generation) is increased by 12.6%.

AB In the present work a 34.3 kW stationary gas engine considered as prime-mover of bottoming thermodynamic cycles. The waste heat recovery cycles of engine exhaust gas consist of several configurations of organic Rankine cycle and combination of Rankine/Kalina cycles, also the engine jacket water heat is recovered by trilateral flash cycle. The performance of bottoming cycles was investigated from thermodynamic and thermo-economic points of view. For the organic Rankine cycle, three fluids including Benzene, Toluene and Cyclohexane have been compared. Also, considering that the trilateral flash cycle is a suitable cycle for heat recovery from a low temperature heat source due to its better matching between the temperature profiles of cycle working fluid and heat source fluid, this cycle is considered as bottoming waste heat recovery cycle for engine jacket water. In order to compare different working fluids and cycle configurations, three objective functions including energy efficiency, exergy efficiency and specific investment cost for the 18 studied cases are compared. The results reveal that, energy, exergy efficiency and specific investment cost of all configurations with toluene as working fluid of organic Rankine cycle is the highest and least compared to the other working fluids, respectively. But for configuration Rankine with Open Feed Heater-Kalina-Trilateral Flash Cycle, benzene fluid is better in terms of specific investment cost, however the energy and exergy efficiency of this cycle is also maximal with toluene fluid. Also, the results depict that configurations Rankine with Internal Heat exchanger - Trilateral Flash Cycle and Rankine with Open Feed Heater_Kalina_Trilateral Flash Cycle thermodynamically, and configurations Rankine with Internal Heat exchanger - Trilateral Flash Cycle and Rankine with Open Feed Heater - Trilateral Flash Cycle exergo-economically show the better performance. In this regard, employing configurations Rankine with Internal Heat exchanger - Trilateral Flash Cycle, Rankine with Open Feed Heater-Kalina - Trilateral Flash Cycle and Rankine with Open Feed Heater - Trilateral Flash Cycle in base mode leads to 6.85 kW, 6.48 kW and 6.54 kW increment in net power produced imposing 3318 $/kW, 4090 $/kW and 3377 $/kW specific investment cost, respectively.

AB This paper aims at performance improvement of conventional combined power and ejector refrigeration (CPER) system driven by geothermal energy. To do so, two novel systems are proposed and their performance is modeled, investigated and compared with each other as well as with the conventional CPER system. In the proposed systems a booster compressor is employed between the evaporator and ejector to increase the output cooling, and thermoelectric generator (TEG) is employed for waste heat recovery to increase the output power. To analyze the conventional and the proposed CPER systems from the energy and exergy perspectives, thermodynamic models are developed, after which a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to examine the effects of design/operating variables on the systems' performance. The results revealed that, proposed booster assisted system incorporated with TEG has a significantly better performance than the conventional CPER system in terms of output power and cooling as well as energy and exergy efficiencies. However, the proposed booster assisted system without incorporating TEG has a lower values of output power and exergy efficiency than the conventional CPER system, while it yields higher values of output cooling and energy efficiency. It is found that, the booster assisted system incorporated with TEG yields higher exergy efficiency by around 18.7% than the conventional CPER system.

AB Pretreatment is a necessary step in the process of biorefinery of lignocellulosics. Here, a novel sequential sugarcane bagasse (SCB) pretreatment method was developed based on potassium peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and alkaline deacetylation (AD) under mild conditions. The co-pretreatment could efficiently remove the lignin and acetyl groups, resulting in a holocellulose-rich (83.5%) solid with superior degradability and a high overall recovery of holocellulose (81.2%). Meanwhile, the highest ethanol titer of 120.77 g/L and succinic acid production of 34.84 g/L were obtained by simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) without the sterilization process for the pretreated SCB (equivalent to an ethanol yield of 0.36 g/g and a succinic acid yield of 0.10 g/g from the holocellulose in raw SCB). These results demonstrated that a high level of bioethanol and bio-based succinic acid can be achieved by the combination of the newly-developed SCB pretreatment method and the robust yeast strain.

AB Performance of an innovative storage system for renewable energy, based on the Power-to-Gas concept are numerically predicted. The investigated system is composed by a high temperature co-electrolyzer of Solid Oxide Electrolyte Cell technology and an experimental methanation section, based on structured catalyst, suitable for high temperature operation. With the aim to thermally integrate high temperature co-electrolysis and methanation, a parametric thermodynamic analysis of the Power-to-Gas system is carried-out with a lumped-parameters approach, including all the thermal and electric energy consumptions. In particular, in order to optimize the system thermal balance of plant, various configurations involving internal heat recovery and pressurization of components are also considered. Numerical results are provided in terms of different performance indicators, such as electric-to-fuel conversion index, first law efficiency and second law efficiency and output-fuel quality indicators. The study demonstrates the possibility to thermally integrate the co-electrolyzer and the high-temperature methanation section achieving significant energy savings. Moreover, the calculated results show that the system set-up providing higher quality of the produced synthetic natural gas do not always lead to larger values in energy conversion efficiency. Eventually, advanced configurations of the Power-to-Gas system including heat recovery allow to achieve first-law efficiency up to values around 80-85% and second-law efficiency around 70-78%; a second methanation section based on conventional low-temperature reactors is included in the system and pressurization of the methanation section, or pressurization of the co-electrolysis section, is mandatory, in order to achieve large fraction of methane (up to 95-99%) in the produced synthetic fuel.

AB Rotary Vane Expander is an interesting solution for small-scale ORC power unit due to its reliability, flexibility and competitive cost. As demonstrated by the authors in previous works, the introduction of a secondary intake port leads to an increase of the aspirated mass flow rate and consequently of the mechanical power produced by the machine. In this paper, theoretical and experimental studies were conducted in order to assess the potential benefits in terms of efficiency introduced by the dual intake expander and the trade-off with the produced power for a given pressure-drop. The theoretical results showed that if the relative gain of mechanical power produced by the dual intake technology is higher than that of working fluid mass flow rate, the efficiency grows when the same machines operate at the same upstream and downstream pressures. Two expanders have been designated, built and tested giving the possibility to experimentally verify the performances of a single and a double intake machine. From measured data a mathematical model of the expander was validated, allowing to use it as a virtual platform for further machine optimization and improvement. It was observed that the efficiency gain introduced by the dual intake device depends on the OEM volumetric efficiency and on the pressure ratio. The global efficiency of the dual intake expander grows up to 30% if the volumetric efficiency is 50% and the pressure ratio is 2.3 while the efficiency benefit decreases to 5% if the volumetric efficiency is 70% and the pressure ratio is 3. Nevertheless, even if the global efficiency would be equal for the two machines, the dual intake technology always allows to increase the delivered mechanical power.

AB Accurate and reliable modeling of photovoltaic (PV) modules is significant for optimal design, operation and evaluation of PV systems. PV models can be classified into equivalent circuit-based white box models and data-driven black box models. Due to the difficulty to obtain the ground true model parameters and the limitation posed by the predetermined model structure, white-box modeling methods generally suffer relatively low accuracy and generalization performance for arbitrary operating conditions. In addition, reported black-box models are based on the conventional artificial neural networks (ANN) that are efficient but have limited performance. In this study, motivated by the high performance of fast developing deep learning techniques, we propose a novel black-box modeling method for the PV modules using a new modified one-dimensional deep residual network (1-D ResNet) and measured I-V characteristic curves, which can predict a whole I-V curve at a time for arbitrary operating conditions. To alleviate the overfitting issue caused by imbalanced data, original I-V curve datasets with highly non-uniform operating conditions are resampled by a grid sampling approach to obtain the datasets with relatively uniform conditions for the subsequent modeling. The proposed 1-D ResNet based model is comprehensively verified and compared with a proposed single-diode based white-box model and three other conventional ANN based black-box models, using large datasets of measured I-V characteristic curves from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Experimental results indicate that black-box models are generally better than the white-box model. Especially, the proposed 1-D ResNet based PV model is obviously superior to other three conventional ANN based black-box models, in terms of accuracy, generalization performance and reliability.

AB Currently, the most important barrier in algal cultivation is growth nutrients cost. In the present study, the isolated alga Synechocystis PCC6803 was acclimatized under laboratory conditions using municipal wastewater and taken for large-scale cultivation in an open raceway pond. At the semi-continuous mode, the alga produced the highest biomass yield of 0.21 g L(-1)d(-1) and it was estimated that the algae could be able to produce 94.5 tones dry biomass ha(-1) year(-1). A low-cost study was conducted to harvest the maximum biomass recovery. The result shows that a combined use of iron (III) chloride and biopolymer enhanced the harvesting process and the maximum biomass recovery was achieved up to 98.7%. In addition, the biomass production cost was thoroughly explored, and it was estimated that the microalgae Synechocystis biomass production cost was approximately 2-3 US$ per kg of biomass. Meanwhile, to reduce the lipid extraction cost, a direct transesterification was performed using tungstated zirconia as a heterogeneous catalyst and the highest biodiesel yield of 90.5% was obtained. In addition, the biodiesel fuel properties were analyzed, and the results revealed that most of the fuel properties found within ASTM D6751 limits. Furthermore, the lipid extracted residues was explored for bioethanol extraction, and 0.186 g bioethanol/g residue was obtained. This is the first study to demonstrate the alga Synechocystis cultivation in an open raceway pond using municipal wastewater successfully and produced two potential biofuels.

AB In this paper, we present a novel polygeneration plant with carbon capture for the combined power and dimethyl ether (DME) production. The plant layout integrates a chemical looping CO2/H2O splitting (CL) unit producing syngas (CO and H-2) for the DME synthesis using the exhaust gases of an oxyfuel power cycle. The primary power is generated by oxy-combustion of syngas generated by the reduction of the metal oxide in the reduction unit of the CL redox cycle with incoming natural gas. The oxyfuel power plant also generates steam for combined power production with two streams Rankine cycles. The aim of the present work is to assess the process on the basis of energy and exergetic efficiency and economic performance of the integrated CL unit for combined power and DME production. The integration proposed resulted in a production of 103 MWe and 185.6 ton/day (2.15 kg/s) of DME. The corresponding energy and exergetic efficiency was 50.2% and 45%, respectively. A discounted cash flow analysis was performed to evaluate the profitability of the process. With a carbon credit of $80/tonne, the plant would be able to meet the current electricity with carbon capture and DME prices of $50/MWh and $18/GJ respectively. The economic analysis provided information on the main economic drivers associated with the high capital investment in the process plant with individual sub-systems. The analysis highlighted the strong potential of integrating chemical looping CO2/H2O splitting for syngas production into polygeneration systems to increase the overall efficiency while reducing the cost of carbon capture.

AB Microalgae are a promising feedstock for alternative fuel for compression ignition engines due to their positive contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Microalgae are gaining significant interest as they can produce more oil than any oilseed plants. Unlike some other plant oils, the use of microalgae as an alternative to fossil fuels, can overcome food versus fuel conflict. In the current investigation, five different chemical components of microalgae hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) biocrude paraffin, xylene, cyclo-pentanone, dioctylphthalate and butanol were mixed in equal volumes. Commercial diesel fuel was used as a reference fuel. The first blend consisted of 5 vol% of each of the 5 components was mixed with 75 vol% diesel. The blend is called as B1. The second blend consisted of 10 vol% of each of the 5 components was mixed with 50 vol% of diesel. This blend is called B2. The neat diesel (100% pure diesel) is called as 100D. The engine used in this study was a six-cylinder high-pressure common rail direct injection diesel engine fitted with a turbocharger. This study deals with engine performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics comparing diesel, B1 and B2 blends. The experimental results indicated a general reduction in both particle mass (PM) and total particle number (PN) emissions with both blends compared to those of diesel. Increase in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions at all four engine loads were found with both B1 and B2 blends. It was realised that the drop or rise of emissions was mainly a function of fuel-bound oxygen.

AB A Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy based on the Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) is proposed for the optimal dispatch of renewable generation units and demand response in a grid-tied hybrid system. The generating system is based on the experimental setup installed in a Distributed Energy Resources Laboratory (LabDER), which includes an AC micro-grid with small scale PV/Wind/Biomass systems. Energy storage is by lead-acid batteries and an H2 system (electrolyzer, H2 cylinders and Fuel Cell). The energy demand is residential in nature, consisting of a base load plus others that can be disconnected or moved to other times of the day within a demand response program. Based on the experimental data from each of the LabDER renewable generation and storage systems, a micro-grid operating model was developed in MATLAB(C) to simulate energy flows and their interaction with the grid. The proposed optimization algorithm seeks the minimum hourly cost of the energy consumed by the demand and the maximum use of renewable resources, using the minimum computational resources. The simulation results of the experimental micro-grid are given with seasonal data and the benefits of using the algorithm are pointed out.

AB In unitized regenerative fuel cells, residual water at the end of electrolysis cell mode greatly affects the cell voltage during mode switching from electrolysis cell to fuel cell mode. Therefore, the residual water removing is essential to realize the mode switching, which requires the knowledge on gas purge effect on cell voltage dynamic response. In this study, gas purge effect in oxygen and hydrogen sides on cell voltage dynamic response is investigated, respectively. In addition, the effects of fuel cell mode startup current density and electrolysis cell mode operating current density are analyzed. The results show that: the increases of gas purging time and purging gas flow rate promote the mode switching from electrolysis cell to fuel cell modes. High flow rate of purging gas is preferred than long gas purging time during mode switching when the same amount of purging gas is used. In addition, gas purging in hydrogen side is necessary. The influence of residual water in hydrogen side increases with the startup current density of FC mode, and long purging time is required for high startup current density of FC mode. Electrolysis cell mode operating current density increase leads fuel cell mode performance decrease under the same gas purge condition.

AB In this work, some notable blade profiles of drag-based vertical axis Savonius wind turbine rotor have been investigated both numerically and experimentally to judge their performances on a common platform. At the outset, 2D unsteady simulation is performed for semicircular, Benesh, modified Bach and elliptical profiles keeping the overall rotor diameter in each case to be constant. The simulation has been carried out using the Shear Stress Transport k-omega turbulence model with the help of the finite volume solver ANSYS Fluent. The torque and power coefficients, in each case, are estimated as a function of tip speed ratio. The total pressure, velocity magnitude, and turbulence intensity contours are obtained and analyzed. Finally, wind tunnel tests are conducted to validate the numerical results. From the numerical simulation, the maximum power coefficients for the semicircular, Benesh, modified Bach and elliptical profiles are found to be 0.272, 0.294, 0.304 and 0.34, respectively. However, the wind tunnel tests with the semicircular, Benesh, modified Bach and elliptical-bladed rotors demonstrated the maximum C-P to be 0.158, 0.159, 0.162, and 0.19, respectively.

AB In this paper, a three-dimensional comprehensive model is firstly proposed for Parabolic Trough Solar Receiver-Reactors (PTSRR) of the Methanol-Steam Reforming Reaction process (MSRR) for hydrogen production. This PTSRR-MSRR comprehensive model is established by combining a comprehensive kinetic model of MSRR, a validated Monte Carlo Ray-Tracing (MCRT) optical model with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM), as well as useful comprehensive evaluation indicators. It is capable of comprehensively simulating and evaluating the whole complex photo-thermal-chemical conversion process of the entire PTSRR system, including the concentration, collection and conversion of photon energy, coupled heat transfers, fluid dynamics, multicomponent transports and methanol-steam reforming reactions. After validation, this comprehensive model was successfully used to determine the comprehensive characteristics and performance of different PTSRRs and realistic conditions. The effects and mechanisms of the solar time, the reflector geometric parameters, the inlet methanol molar flow rate, the reaction temperature limitation and the nonuniformity of the concentrated solar flux density distribution were discussed in detail. It is revealed that the reaction temperature limitation that should be smaller than the sintering temperature of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst particles may only appear locally, which is mainly caused by the nonuniformity of the concentrated solar flux density distribution and the corresponding local peak solar flux density. For the mechanism of this kind of temperature limitation, different control strategies and optimizations were examined. Better comprehensive characteristics and performance of PTSRRs can be obtained, by making a reasonable tradeoff between the optical efficiency, the solar flux nonuniformity and the reflector surface curvature characteristics.

AB Accurate and reliable parameter extraction of photovoltaic (PV) models is urgently desired for the simulation, evaluation, control, and optimization of PV systems. Although many meta-heuristic algorithms have been used to extract the PV parameters, the extracted parameters are usually not very accurate and reliable. To accurately and reliably extract the parameters of different PV models, an improved teaching-learning-based optimization (ITLBO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The novelty of ITLBO lies primarily in the improved teaching and learning strategies with two improvements: (i) the teacher adopts different teaching strategies according to learner levels in the teacher phase; and (ii) in the learner phase, a new learning strategy is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation. The performance of ITLBO is verified by extracting the parameters of the single diode model, the double diode model, and three PV modules. The experimental results indicate that ITLBO obtains better performance with respect to accuracy and reliability compared to the other algorithms.

AB Turbulence intensity of wind speed is a viable uncertainty quantification for wind speed. This paper develops an innovative framework for multi-step wind speed prediction using Wind Speed and Turbulence Intensity-based Recursive Neural Network. In this study, real-time turbulence intensity is measured from actual wind speed, and multi-resolution features of wind speed and turbulence intensity are deployed as input for prediction model. Ensemble recursive neural network is designed to execute prediction on multiple prediction intervals ranging from 10 min to 12 h with two different integrating strategies. Experimental results indicate that: (1) The proposed model dramatically outperforms conventional machine learning models on multi-step wind speed prediction; (2) The reliable wind speed prediction requires that the maximum time-resolution of turbulence intensity should be longer than prediction interval; (3) Turbulence intensity features involved prediction will achieves higher accuracy than the approaches that apply signal processing on raw wind speed, especially on middle-long term prediction. Therefore, this innovative scheme for multi-step wind speed prediction can be of immense utility to apply data-driven methods for accurate long-term wind speed prediction.

AB This paper proposes an advanced trigenerative micro compressed air energy storage (CAES) system, which acts as combined cooling, heating and power system by recovering cooling, heating and power energy during or after expansion. The proposed CAES system can be integrated with grid and placed close to users' side. Based on the users' demand, the proposed CAES system can produce different kinds of energy by adjusting the turbine inlet temperature in different seasons. The mathematical model of the proposed system including energy analysis and economic analysis has been set up. A multi-objective optimization by the aid of Non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithm-II(NSGA-II) is employed to determine the design parameters of the proposed system considering the round trip efficiency and the annual total cost saving. A case application reveals the effectiveness of the above method. At the final optimal point, the round trip efficiency and the annual total cost saving are 0.762 and 147,820.0 $/year, respectively. Then, the design parameters of the proposed system are as follow: the capacity of each compressor is 256.0 kW, the capacity of turbine is 830.0 kW, and the volume of compressed air reservoir is 502.0 m(3). In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed mainly to assess the influence of key parameters variation on the proposed CAES system performance. This research will provide a guiding principle for design and practical application of trigenerative CAES system to mitigate the power shortage and improve economy for users.

AB In countries with tropical climates there is a great need for air-conditioning in buildings. This is due to the high temperatures and high humidity in the tropics and sub-tropical regions such as Northeast Brazil. Overall, electricity bills show that an excessive amount of money is spent on achieving thermal comfort using regular air-conditioning systems to remove heat from buildings. The electricity consumed by such systems can represent about 50% of the total electricity bill. This paper proposes using a cogeneration system in the rectorate building of a university campus. A cogeneration system comprises a reciprocating engine as the prime mover, a back-up boiler, an accumulation tank and a single-effect absorption chiller to remove excess heat. The main advantage of using this kind of system is that increasing the production temperature of cold water improves the overall efficiency of the system as the residual heat is at a lower temperature. This solution is applied to the rectorate of the Federal University of Paraiba (UFPB) in Joao Pessoa, Northeast Brazil, where the demand for cool temperatures is intense and the consumption of energy is extremely high since the average annual relative humidity and the dry bulb temperature are about 75% and 27 degrees C, respectively.

AB This paper aims to reveal the coupling correlation of the ORC related system, and verify the boundaries and feasibilities of the system-level modeling. A kW-scale ORC test rig with a self-made expansion valve is set up for the dynamic test under three common freedoms, namely the mass flow rate of working fluid, heat source and cooling source. By imposing the same real-time experimental conditions, the system-level dynamic simulation is performed on the Modelica/Dymola software. The test rig and dynamic model are of high-accuracy and reliable after examining the heat balances and error propagation of the measurement uncertainties, as well as calibrating with theoretical analysis. Results show that the internal disturbance of mass flow rate of working fluid significantly affect the states parameters. The external disturbance of mass flow rate of cooling source has a less effect on the states parameter, while the states parameters are insensitive to the external disturbance of mass flow rate of heat source. The simulation results are in agreement with the experimental results. The average overshoot of the outlet temperature of cooling source is 0.7 degrees C, and the average overshoot of the evaporation pressure is 48 kPa, which coincide with the results from the experiment under the disturbance of working fluid mass flow rate. It shows the potential of such simulation model to be a guided model, which also predicts that the maximum desired power output of the ORC test rig is about 1874.7 W, with the thermal efficiency of 6.94%.

AB A Photovoltaic/Thermal (PV/T) system combines PV and thermal collector, which is considered promising technology especially for building integrated PV/T system. The PV/T cooling systems using water, water-PCM and nanofluid/nano-PCM moves through the cooling pipes were investigated, in this study. However, this paper focuses on testing different PV/T systems (conventional PV, water-based PVT, water-nanofluid PVT, and nanofluid/nano-PCM) under the same conditions and environment using one artificial neural network (ANN) based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) system. Also, investigate the differences in the efficiency of these systems on both thermal and electrical when using only one simulation system (MLP). The proposed ANN approach proved that using of nanofluid/nano-PCM was enhanced the electrical efficiency from 8.07% to 13.32% and its thermal efficiency reached 72%. Also, the voltage was improved significantly. Many measurement methods were used for validating the results of the proposed ANN model like the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Correlation (R), and coefficient of determination (R-2). The proposed ANN model achieved a final MSE of 0.0229 in the training phase and 0.0282 in the cross-validation phase. The sensitivity analysis showed that the influence of solar irradiation and Amb-temp almost has a constant effect on electrical efficiency. However, the Ambient temperature had a significant impact on thermal efficiency. The results of the network were consistent with the experimental results of the current study and published works.

AB The extensive use of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in waste heat recovery motivates the employment of ORC technique to recover the waste heat in coal-fired plants. A novel combined cooling-heating and power (CCHP) system integrated Organic Rankine Cycle (CCHP-ORC) for recovering the waste heat of bottom slag in coal-fired plant is first proposed in this paper. A MATLAB procedure with REFPROP database is developed for the proposed system based on the mass, energy and exergy balances of each component. With the application of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, R1234ze(E) and heptane/R601a are adopted as the optimal working fluids for the Sing Fluid CCHP-ORC and Dual Fluid CCHP-ORC systems, respectively. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effect of superheat degree of turbine inlet temperature, chilled water mass flow rate and condenser temperature on the coefficient of performance, thermal efficiency, heat exergy, cooling exergy, total exergy production and exergy production rate. The results show that the superheat degree of turbine inlet temperature benefits the enhancement of the exergy production rate. The enhancement of chilled water mass flow rate leads to an increase in coefficient of performance and refrigerating capacity while the cooling exergy, total exergy production and exergy production rate decrease. Except for exergy production rate in Dual Fluid CCHP-ORC system, the rise of condenser temperature leads to a decrease of performance parameters. As the condenser temperature rises from 25 degrees C to 40 degrees C, the thermal efficiency of Cycle2 declines 19.4% and 18.3% respectively in the Sing Fluid CCHP-ORC system and Dual Fluid CCHP-ORC system.

AB Up to date, despite the massive generation of crude oil sludge (COS), the technical completeness for disposing COS has not been fully achieved. Considering its harmfulness and the high content of hydrocarbon species, establishing an environmentally benign platform for the simultaneous waste disposal and energy recovery will be greatly important. To this end, this study mainly focuses on pyrolysis of COS. To develop the more sustainable pyrolytic platform for COS, this study particularly employed carbon dioxide (CO2) as reactive gas medium. To chase the thermolytic behaviors of COS in the presence of CO2, a series of the TGA tests of COS was conducted, and the TGA tests confirmed that CO2 did not change the thermolytic behaviors, such as onset and end temperature for the thermolysis of COS. Nevertheless, CO2 greatly influenced the pyrogenic products via the heterogeneous reactions (i.e., volatilized hydrocarbons and CO2). In detail, CO2 expedited the thermal cracking and dehydrogenation of volatilized hydrocarbons evolved from COS, thereby resulting in the enhanced generation of H-2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2. Despite the fact that the enhanced thermal cracking and dehydrogenation generally enhances the aromaticity in pyrolytic oil, the enhanced generation of CO was observed only from pyrolysis of COS in CO2, of which enhanced generation of CO effectively decreased the aromaticity by restricting the formation of benzene derivatives.

AB Two categories of thermoelectric systems, i.e. thermoelectric active cooling (TAC) and thermoelectric self-cooling (TSC), were broadly applied for electronic cooling. Energy efficiency maximization and entropy generation minimization will be simultaneously achieved for both thermoelectric systems. Thermodynamic models of TAC and TSC systems are established to clarify the effects of main influencing parameters (i.e., applied current, thermal conductance in hot and cold ends) on the energy and entropy performances. Subsequently, under the situation of electronic cooling with constant material properties, a comprehensive performance comparison between TAC and TSC has been conducted, including decision targets, irreversible characteristics and environmental impacts. Furthermore, in order to improve the heat dissipation potential, the effects of material properties on the system performance are also sensitively identified for both TAC and TSC systems. For both systems, internal irreversibility is more pronounced than external one. Numerical results demonstrated that system efficiency of TAC could be higher than that of TSC; the operating mode for TAC could be completely switched to that for TSC when the input power was turned into zero. Present investigation could give suitable guidelines for thermoelectric systems applied for electronic cooling.

AB The energy performance certification has been recognized as an effective assessment methodology and tool to systematically manage energy consumption and improve energy performance. In the process manufacturing industry and building industry, a large number of energy performance certifications have been applied worldwide with remarkable results achieved in energy saving and emissions mitigation. Mechanical manufacturing industry, which is characterised as a typical discrete manufacturing having a wide distribution in operations with large consumption of energy and low efficiency, has a considerable potential of benefiting from energy saving and emissions mitigation. The objective of this paper is to perform a review and analysis of energy performance certification in the mechanical manufacturing industry for evaluating its potentials and applicability for performance enhancement. We begin with analyzing energy performance certification and research gaps to develop an operational definition of energy performance certification. The scope of energy performance certification and the method for data acquisition are reviewed. Next, we establish the classification of energy performance certification from perspectives of the energy benchmarking, rating and labelling to lay a foundation for its implementation framework and evaluating its practicability. Through the systemic review and analysis, the current state of researching energy performance certification is provided with the methods for developing energy performance certification summarized and analyzed. These findings are useful references for managers to strengthen energy management and monitoring and improve energy performance in the mechanical manufacturing industry.

AB Vertical earth-to-air heat exchanger (VEAHE) systems have smaller land occupation and more efficient usage of geothermal energy than conventional earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHE) systems. However, a large fluctuation in its outlet air temperature subject to ambient air temperature variations may occur, preventing it from meeting the indoor thermal comfort requirements. To address this issue, a novel VEAHE system integrated with annular phase change material (PCM) was proposed. The PCM can reduce the outlet air temperature fluctuation due to its ability to store and release energy. To evaluate its thermal performance, a numerical model was developed and validated by experimental data. The results showed a good agreement between the simulated and monitored data, with a maximum absolute relative error of 1.59% and 1.34% for the outlet air and PCM temperature, respectively. Then the validated model was applied to investigate the effects of PCM and its parameters on the system's thermal performance. Results showed that the annular PCM can decrease the outlet air temperature fluctuation of the system without PCM by 31% and 29% under air velocities of 1 m/s and 2 m/s respectively, enabling more stable outlet air temperatures to be achieved. The effect of PCM thermal conductivity depended heavily on the PCM thickness. Improving the system's thermal performance by simply increasing PCM thermal conductivity may not be an effective method, particularly when the PCM thickness was relatively small. As the PCM thickness exceeded 5 mm, an increase in the PCM thickness had a relatively small effect on the variation of outlet air temperatures. The outlet air temperature range decreased with the increase of PCM lengths, while a downward trend in the fluctuation decrease can be observed. In addition, an economic analysis of the proposed system was conducted, indicating that its static payback period was 20.8 years.

AB This paper proposes a novel and unique degradation diagnosis method for photovoltaic modules employing a xenon flash lighting system and a capacitor for degradation detection connected to the module output. The xenon flash lighting system is not only compact and lightweight but also small in power consumption and can be lit by batteries. Therefore, the portability of the lighting system is satisfactory, and the proposed diagnosis method is expected to be relatively easily applicable to outdoor photovoltaic power plants. In addition, since the lighting system can provide artificial and precisely controlled intense flash light to the module and this proposed method includes a sensing process of the module temperature, this proposed method can, in principle, evaluate the internal series resistance and determine accurate degradation level independent of the weather and temperature conditions. The authors carried out the numerical simulations and successfully made clear that the theoretically unavoidable measurement error of the internal series resistance is only 2% less than its variation width, confirming the validity of the basic ideas of the proposed degradation diagnosis method. The authors then performed the demonstration test experiments using a prototype experimental apparatus and investigated its practicability for real PV modules, successfully confirming that the same accuracy as expected through the simulations can be achieved also through the experiments.

AB To reduce the fossil fuels consumption and their environmental impact, improve the waste heat efficiency, an enhanced transcritical CO2 ejector based combined cooling and power system is proposed using recovered waste heat. This system can employ in vehicles and make them run more environmentally friendly. The new proposed system includes a power generation part and a transcritical ejector based refrigeration system. A thermo-dynamical model is developed to evaluate the enhanced proposed system. A comprehensive parametric investigation and thermo-economic analysis are presented to study the effects of key parameters on the thermoeconomic performance of the system. The results show that back pressure of ejector (gas cooler pressure) plays the main role to improve the system performance. A 10 bar increase in ejector back-pressure of ejector leads to an increase of 16.4% in energy efficiency while the exergy efficiency decreases of 9.2%. From exergy analysis, it is found that the biggest irreversibility in the system belongs to the internal heat exchanger used between pump and turbine outflows. For the cooling capacity of 10 kW, a multi-objective optimization is carried out and the optimal values of energy and exergy efficiencies obtained from the Pareto frontier results are 27.42% and 24.21%, respectively, while it leads to the net power output of 7.55 kW. In this case, the net present value and the simple payback period of the proposed system are equal to 0.3419 M$ and about 4 years and 6 months, respectively.

AB Snow removal is a critical security issue in airports, where heat-pipe technology can be an environmentally friendly and efficient alternative to traditional approaches for snow removal. This study investigated the long-term thermal regime of airfield-runways equipped with a heat-pipe system, using data collected over several recent years from two full-scale snow-melting systems, one located in Beijing, and the other in Harbin, China. The findings showed that the heat-pipe system automatically increases the airfield-runway surface temperatures by up to 17 degrees C utilizing geothermal energy in winter for preventing icing. Surface temperature levels up to 0 degrees C were observed to increase by over 25% when a shallow pipe embedded depth and a longer pipe evaporation section were selected. However, the surface temperature was less affected by the diameter of the heat-pipe. Field experiments indicated that, the heat-pipe technology threshold value for the airfield-runway snow-melting performance was an ambient air temperature exceeding - 10 degrees C. Using the heat-pipe technology, the snow-melting rate on an airfield-runway was about 3-8 mm/h within the working range, and there was therefore a decrease in the snow-cover durations. Particularly, the heat-pipe airfield-runway was always free of snow when the average ambient air temperature exceeded -4 degrees C. The statistical results illustrated that the heat-pipe airfield-runway snow-melting system is applicable in more than 78% of the cities in China, indicating that this technology is feasible and practical in China and can be applied in other countries.

AB Fuel cells offer one of the most eco-friendly and efficient ways of energy production. In this study a thermodynamic and exergoeconomic assessment of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system at steadystate operation condition are carried out. Thereafter, the feasibility of integrating a proton exchange membrane Electrolyzer (PEME) to supply required fuel for a PEMFC, operating in the same outlet power range is investigated. The results demonstrate that increasing the current density rises the following parameters in the system: the power and power density rates of the PEMFC and PEME, the exergy destruction rate of each component, the hydrogen production and consumption rates in the cycles, the PEME output voltage, cost rate of power generation and the power cost of the PEMFC. By increasing the PEMFC output voltage, the energy and exergy efficiencies reduce. Moreover, rising the outlet temperature of the PEMFC increases the power and power density rates of the PEMFC and also the energy and exergy efficiencies of the system. While increasing the outlet and operating temperature of the PEME increases the power consumption rate and reduces the energy and exergy efficiencies. The highest energy efficiency of the PEMFC is 36.7% and corresponding maximum exergy efficiency is found 54%, while the lowest values are found 31% and 45.3%, respectively. The cost rate of the power generation by PEMFC is varied between 7.96 x 10(-4) and 1.33 x 10(-3) $/s and the corresponding rate of the exergy unit cost range is 115.6-132.2 $/GJ.

AB Heating tower heat pumps (HTHPs) are proposed as an alternative to the conventional heat pumps. However, lacking performance evaluation of the HTHPs in different regions limits their applications worldwide. To address this issue, this paper carries out a large-scale comprehensive performance evaluation of the HTHPs in 869 typical locations. These locations are in the warm, mixed, and cool climate zones, where buildings need both cooling and heating supply. Seven performance indices are adopted, including the annual coefficient of performance (COP), COP in cooling season, COP in heating season, regeneration ratio, number of unsatisfactory hours, matching degree of heat pump, and matching degree of heating tower. The performance evaluation of the HTHPs is conducted by the processes of location selection, building load calculation, system sizing, simulation, and evaluation. The results show that the HTHPs have excellent performance in the warm and mixed climate zones, where the average annual COPs are 4.67 and 3.68, respectively. The HTHPs are also applicable in the cool climate zone with an average annual COP of 3.11. The distributions of all the performance indices are presented through color maps, and the results are analyzed considering the air temperature and relative humidity data of the locations.

TI On the number of PV modules in series for large-power irrigation systems

ID WATER PUMPING SYSTEMS; FEASIBILITY; MODEL
AB Large-power PV irrigation systems (PVIS) from 40 kWp to 1 MWp are increasingly being introduced onto the market since the main technical barriers have been removed and some real-scale demonstrators have shown cost savings up to 80% when compared with the electricity costs from the grid or diesel generators. The electricity compatibility between the PV generator and the frequency converter limits the number of PV modules in series to keep the PV generator voltage below the maximum input voltage of the frequency converter. This limitation can produce losses in terms of PV production and water pumped. As the maximum voltage delivered by the PV generator depends, among others, on the solar cell temperature, some electronic devices are being offered in the market to change the number of PV modules in series depending on this temperature, but they are complex and reduce the reliability of the system. This complexity is not justified because an in-depth analysis of the actual impact of these losses has never been carried out. This paper analyses and quantifies these PV energy losses for the two main applications in the market (pumping to a water pool at a variable frequency, and direct pumping to the irrigation network at constant power) which have different mechanisms of losses, and for locations with different typical meteorological years. The results show that, in the case of pumping to a water pool, the losses are irrelevant if the maximum yearly mean ambient temperature of the location is less than 21.5 degrees C and the voltage required by the pump is less than 568 V. In the case of constant power pumping, the losses are irrelevant if the mentioned temperature is less than 25.8 degrees C and the grid voltage is less than 587 V. In the rest of the cases, the losses are minimized just adding one more PV module in series. As a result, a general methodology to help designers selecting the number of PV modules in series in PV irrigation systems is presented.

AB Hydrogen has more energy per unit mass (141.8 MJ/kg) than any other fuel but also has the lowest gaseous density (0.084 kg/m(3)), and liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage is a solution with high energy density. However, LH2 storage has the characteristics of low temperature (20 K) and easy evaporation, putting forward higher requirements for insulation system. At present, the improvement and optimization of insulation system consisting of spray on foam insulation (SOFI), multilayer insulation (MLI) and variable density MLI (VDMLI) is a hot topic. Considering the considerable sensible heat of hydrogen, this paper introduces self-evaporation vapor cooled shield (VCS) into the above-mentioned insulation systems to fully recover its sensible heat to improve insulation performance. A thermodynamic model has been established to study the insulation properties of composite insulation system for LH2 tank, and the results have good agreement with test data. Coupling effects among them are analyzed and the optimization strategies of MLI, VDMLI and VCS are quantitatively explained to obtain better insulation performance. The heat flux and temperature profile of four insulation structures (MLI, VDMLI, MLI + VCS and VDMLI + VCS) have also been quantitatively analyzed, which can provide guidance for insulation system optimization. The insulation performance of composite insulation system under different vacuum conditions have also been compared.

AB A solar assisted combined cooling, heating and power system coupled with an organic Rankine cycle (SCCHPORC) is proposed and investigated via both experimental and simulation methods. The dimethyl ether (DME) is used as the fuel of the proposed system for the prime mover (PM) and auxiliary boiler (AB). DME was chosen based on that it is friendly to the environment and avoids low temperature corrosion. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated during typical summer and winter days via a case study using thermodynamic and economic methods. The results show that the proposed system followed by the electricity load (FEL) strategy can satisfy most of the electricity demand. The cooling and heating profiles are supplied by utilizing the PMs' cooling water and the parabolic trough collector (PTC). Additionally, the released energy from a thermal energy storage (TES) can significantly reduce the need for grid energy during peak load hours. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed SCCHP-ORC system is higher than that of original system by 9.87%. The minimum values of carbon dioxide emission saving ratio are of 58.14% during summer and 17.32% during winter. The total amount of carbon dioxide saved are 778.7 kg/day during a typical summer day and 358.7 kg/day during a typical winter day duo to the technologies selected in this system. Besides, the sensitivity analysis shows that the changed electricity price has a largest impact on the payback period ranging from 4.0 year to 6.5 year.

AB The present study was conducted in two parts. The first section was to prepare Al2O3 water-based nanofluids for the thermal-electrochemistry experiment through a two-step synthesis assisted by a microemulsion ultrasound technique. Moreover, 0.5-2.5 wt-percent concentration (wt%) nanofluids were added into a battery cell with copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) electrodes for an reduction-oxidation (Redox) reaction to investigate the generating power capacity between 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C. The second part derived the empirical formula of electric charge density for alumina nanofluids as electrolyte using micro-power generation experiment and dimensional analysis between functional relationships and experimental parameters. The results revealed that the mixtures of Al2O3 nanofluid and emulsifying agent at a concentration of 2.5 wt% and 40 degrees C had the highest electric charge density based on the thermodynamic activity and chemical potential of the electrolytes. The empirical formula validated and estimated the electric charge density for alumina nanofluids with an emulsifier at between 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C and between 0.5 wt% and 2.5 wt%. However, the error rates for the calculated and measured values were high due to unstable power outputs at low temperatures. The error rate was below 5%. The formula presented here was an approximate estimation model which took the emulsifier into account.

AB Offshore oil and gas platforms have very high-power demands, being the electric power supply usually provided by gas turbines operating with natural gas extracted from the field. Since fields are ageing, the amount of gas available for electric power production is declining. One common alternative is to feed those gas turbines with fuel diesel, which is an expensive solution at remote locations and has a high carbon footprint. Since oil and gas platforms often operate in deep waters and are exposed to energetic wave climates, ocean wave energy can be used in their electrification. Even though wave energy is not yet cost competitive for suppling onshore grids, power supplying remote oil and gas platforms might be the niche market enabler to launch commercially the sector, due to the high cost of the electricity produced in those offshore facilities and the abundance of wave resource at most of their locations. This paper proposes a new techno-economic model to assess and scale wave energy converters to match the local wave climate at their deployment site, while maximizing the income of the wave farm and accounting for their life cycle costs. At the same time, the economic feasibility of providing electricity from ocean waves to remote offshore oil and gas facilities is analysed using as case study an oil and gas platform in operation at the North Sea. Seven wave energy converters were assessed at the case study site and it was proved that its hydrodynamic performance is not directly linked to its economics attractiveness. The values of the levelized cost of energy ranged from 188 to 471 (Sic)/MWh and were benchmarked against reference values. The feasibility of providing electricity from waves to offshore oil and gas facilities is also demonstrated and the exploration of this untapped market advocated.

AB Oxygen transport to the reaction sites through electrode structure is crucial to the operation and performance of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. In this study, a 3-D steady-state simulation is developed to investigate the oxygen transport phenomena utilizing the measured ex-situ transport properties and the actual dimensions of the cell components as input parameters, and the simulation is validated with the in-situ experimental data on the current-voltage relation. The pore structure is measured by the method of Standard Porosimetry based on capillary equilibrium. The indicators for the ability of mass convection and diffusion in the electrodes, permeability and effective diffusibility, are measured based on the Darcy's and Fick's laws, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that the average through-plane convective oxygen flux is about 20% of its diffusive counterpart under small current densities (0.10 A.cm(-2)), while it is reduced to only 5-14% under high current densities (1.22 A.cm(-2)). The local oxygen transport also varies significantly with the locations inside the cathode electrode under various average current densities. The results suggest that if measures can be taken to enhance the convection in the porous electrode under high current densities, the transport of oxygen to the reaction sites can be considerably improved.

AB With the advancement in sub-ambient cooling of water during daytime under the sun with scalable-manufactured radiative cooling metamaterials, the challenge for applications lies in design and building of large-scale radiative cooling systems. Here, we present a kW-scale, 24-hour continuously operational, radiative sky cooling system, with both experimental study and detailed modeling. We first quantitatively show how water flow rate directly affects the system cooling power and inversely affects the water temperature drop. A day-and-night stagnant (flow rate = 0 L/(min.m(2))) water cooling test of the system shows a consistent sub-ambient water temperature drop of 5-7 degrees C. A daytime cooling test of the system at a low flow rate of 0.227 L/(min.m(2)) yields a maximum sub-ambient temperature drop of 4.0 degrees C with an average net cooling power of around 80 W/m(2). Further modelling for a typical metrological year (in Phoenix, Arizona) shows that the system could generate as much as 350 kWh cold (or 26 kWh/m(2)) with a sub-ambient temperature drop of 4-5 degrees C at a low flow rate of 0.1 L/(min.m(2)) during a typical summer month. The cold generated could be used to assist AC systems in regions or seasons with high ambient temperatures.

AB Thermal dewatering using spray dryers is an energy-intensive process, which recently, applied for removal of water from industrial effluents by evaporation. Reduction of energy consumption is vital to reduce operating cost in addition to sustainable development. In this paper, the modern integrated energy savings scheme is proposed in four parts. (i) An advanced energy saving configuration named as a hybrid heat recovery system for a spray dryer, (ii) Developed rigorous but simple mathematical model for direct and hybrid heat recovery system, (iii) A generalized performance indicator for investigation of environmental impact on energy recovery called as 'Sustainability Index' is proposed for thermal systems and demonstrated for spray dryer, and finally (iv) The proposed methods are explained with the help of an illustrative example taken from the literature. Up to 80% recirculation ratio, performance enhancement, and Sustainability Index are significantly higher for the hybrid heat recovery system than the direct heat recovery system, while for higher than 80% recirculation ratio, both are approaching towards nearly same value. Furthermore, with increasing recirculation ratio, moisture recirculation into the drying chamber also increases, which reduces the requirement of the mass flow rate of dry hot air due to the higher heat capacity of recirculated moisture. A reduction in hot air requirement reduces the high-grade blower power in addition to net heat supplied. Dryer efficiency and sustainability index, both show a strong dependency on the amount of heat recovery for spray dryer.

AB TiZr-based metallic glass has a unique glass transition point. It is located at the top of the first exothermic peak instead of at the typical endothermic transformation reaction before the supercooled liquid region (Delta T-x). It is hard to identify the glass transition temperature (T-g) and Delta T-x of these TiZr-based amorphous alloys by an exothermic-exothermic reaction. In this study, based on the physical characteristics of the free volume reduction, KWW-exponent beta, the activation energy for structural relaxation (Q(relax)), and the incubation time by isothermal annealing in DSC analyses, the exact T-g point can be precisely identified. As a result, the Ti42Zr42Ta3Si10Sn3 amorphous alloy presents an extra-wide supercooled liquid region (Delta T-x), up to 149 K.

AB Influence of oxygen atmosphere on crystallization of (OeSe(2))(x)(Sb2Se3)(1-x) glasses (for x = 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5) was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction analysis and infrared microscopy. Particlesize-dependent study was performed to reveal the role of mechanically induced defects. The presence of oxygen led to an early formation of a thin surface crystalline layer (smoothly structured) that significantly influenced further crystal growth. The most pronounced consequence was surprisingly found in case of the (GeSe2)(0.3)(Sb2Se3)(0.7) composition that crystallizes in volume. The thin surface crystalline layer hindered the macroscopic viscous flow, so that the samples retained their original shape, and these quasi-stationary conditions accelerated the initial nucleation and growth rates. At the same time, however, these conditions prevented the samples from reaching full crystallinity. In case of the compositions with x = 0.4 and 0.5, the crystal growth proceeded only at the surface and presence of external interfaces and mechanically induced defects took over the major role driving the crystallization kinetics. Correlation of the calorimetric, microscopic and viscosity data is discussed in detail.

AB An ab initio molecular-dynamics simulation has been carried out to investigate structure of fluid sulfur at 1323 K, a supercritical region. The simulated structure factor agrees well with that experimentally obtained. We found that various kinds of sulfur molecules are formed and a bond at the end of a chain molecule is shorter than that at the inside of the chain. In particular, a S-4 chain molecule exhibits approximately 0.3 A difference between them. This result explains the results obtained by x-ray diffraction [Inui et al., J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 98,012,008 (2008)1, why the average bond length is almost constant although the coordination number decreases to 1.0, corresponding to a S-2 molecule with a double bond, at low densities.

AB Recently, for the first time, a metastable liquid miscibility (MLMG) in a metallic alloy system was found and determined (Z. D. Wu et al. J. Non-Cryst. Solids 410 (2015) 51-57 and W. Z. Zhou et al., J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 432 (2016) 420-425). According to thermodynamics, a MLMG consists of two decomposition reactions, which are liquid state nucleation and growth (LNG) and liquid state spinodal decomposition (LSD). However, in all of the results reported so far, only LSD was found. In this work, by using Porod's law, decomposition by LNG was found, confirming the existence of the LNG regime in the MLMG.

AB Two glass series were developed based on the substitution of a monovalent glass modifier for a di- or trivalent ion in a high borate glass system. The BRS series consists of compositions 0.70 B2O3 -0.30-X Rb2O - X SrO, and the BRG series consists of compositions 0.70 B2O3-0.30-X Rb2O-X Ga2O3, where 0.00 <= X <= 0.10 in increments of 0.2. All glasses were characterized in order to examine their composition-structure-property relationships, and to assess their potential for use as degradable, radiopaque embolic agents. Glasses were melt quenched, and evaluated in terms of structural changes (B-11 MAS-NMR, density, and glass transition temperature), changes in radiopacity (both CT and MRI), and changes in degradation timeframes under simulated physiological conditions. Structural analysis determined there was no change in the B4% of the BRS series, despite a linear increase in density and Tg. The strontium acts as a crosslinker, creating a more hydrolytically stable network, which leads to longer dissolution times. Conversely, the BRG series displayed a linear decrease in the B4%, a decrease in density (Tg data not available), yet a slight increase in hydrolytic stability is also observed. Gallium most likely acts more as a glass former than a glass modifier, thereby sequestering oxygens from the tetrahedral boron centers, creating trigonal B3 centers and tetrahedral gallium. All glasses were found to be imageable on CT (intensity > 3200 HU at 120 kVp), and invisible on clinical MR imaging modalities.

The formation of thermodynamically metastable phase, layered Na2MnP2O7, at the surface of the glass occurred. Heat treatment at 430 degrees C for 3 h lead to surface crystals of Na2MnP2O7 oriented with the (101) direction perpendicular to the sample surface. As the heat treatment temperature increased, the glass-ceramic samples deformed, and the presence numerous micro bubbles due to dissolved water was detected.

AB A commercially available lithium (di)silicate glass-ceramic used for dental prostheses was characterized with respect to its quantitative phase composition and crystallinity. For analysis of quantitative phase content, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used combined with the G-factor method, an external standard technique. Samples of the material were analyzed in the pre-crystallized state and after final crystallization heat-treatment in order to characterize the changes occurring during the final crystallization stage. The bulk chemical composition of the commercial blocks, matching the composition of the precursor glass, was determined by a combination of X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis.
   In the pre-crystallized sample, Li2SiO3 with low crystallite sizes and clear anisotropic crystallinity was detected as the only crystalline phase. During the second heat-treatment conducted according to the standard routine defined by the manufacturer, Li2Si2O5 and Li3PO4 were formed. A fraction of Li2SiO3 remained, while the size of its crystallites (coherent scattering domains) significantly increased during the second heat-treatment. By combining XRD and XRF/ICP-OES data, the chemical composition of the residual glass phase was determined in the pre- and finally-crystallized samples. The residual glass phases were shown to be enriched in ZrO2, as no Zr4+ containing crystalline phase was detected. Knowledge of the residual glass composition is a step forward in optimizing the mechanical performance of dental glass-ceramics.

AB Iodine 129 is a radioactive waste produced by the nuclear industry. Due to its high volatility, it cannot be vitrified in conventional borosilicate glasses. This paper investigates the feasibility of iodine conditioning using a glass matrix intended for long-term storage in a geological repository. Silver phosphate glasses, which can incorporate high amounts of iodine and can be synthesized at low temperature, were chosen for this study. In order to increase their chemical durability, the glasses were cross-linked by niobium and bismuth oxides. Niobium and bismuth incorporation limits were determined for an iodine amount of 12 wt% and ranged from 1.6 mol% to 4.0 mol%, depending on the Ag2O/P2O5 ratio. The glass structures were investigated using P-31 MAS NMR, RAMAN spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The iodine local environment was determined by EXAFS at iodine K-edge. Structural investigations showed that the introduction of these cross linking reagents induces a significant increase in the polymerization degree of the glasses. However despite this higher connectivity, the two cross linking reagents have a low impact on the glass transition temperature after iodine addition.

AB Sliding tribocorrosion behavior of non-ferromagnetic Fe-based bulk metallic glass (BMG) was investigated under corrosive environments. Electrochemical results revealed that Fe-based BMG exhibited excellent corrosion resistance in 3.5 wt% NaCl, 1 mol/L HCl and 1 mol/L HAc solutions. Sliding friction measurements indicated the presence of aqueous solutions significantly exacerbated the material loss. The tribocorrosion mechanism of Fe-based BMG involved the abrasive wear associated with corrosive wear. The synergy effect of wear and corrosion was dependent on the corrosive condition, Cl--containing solutions could ease the material loss within a certain range by forming fragmentized passive products as the lubricants during the tribocorrosion sliding process. Results hinted the potential of Fe-based BMGs as structural materials for the anti-tribocorrosion applications.

AB Heavy metal glass samples of the system x(2Bi(2)O(3)center dot MnO)center dot(10-x)B2O3 with different compositions were prepared via the conventional method. Differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to study the thermal behaviour and structure of the glasses. Their physical, optical and electrical properties were studied to characterize the materials. The higher strength of the B-O bond than the Bi-O bond leads to an increase in the thermal stability of the prepared glass. Both the density and molar volume were increased with an increase in the x value, i.e., the Bi2O3 content. Phase separation is the main feature of the glass structure observed using SEM. Some traces from Bi2O3 and/or MnB4O2 were detected in samples B6 (x = 6) and B3 (x = 3) by XRD. The optical band gap (E-opt) lies between 2 and 3 eV; it increases with a decrease in Bi2O3 content. All glasses exhibited good transmission in the infrared (IR) region, reaching similar to 45% at similar to 1750 nm. The activation energies of these prepared compositions were estimated, and their conductivities were found to increase with increasing temperature, revealing their semiconducting character.

AB We simulated the Tantalum (Ta) system to form monatomic metallic glass (MG), using molecular dynamics (MD). The simulation is investigated within the framework of the embedded atom method (EAM) potential. Owing to studying the local atomic structure of Ta monoatomic MG, several structural analysis techniques are adopted to characterize the polyhedral network in terms of short-range order (SRO) and medium-range order (MRO). The simulation results confirm that the splitting in the second peak of the radial distribution function (RDF) proving the formation of amorphous phase. We found that the distorted Voronoi icosahedra < 0,1,10,2 > is the most dominant polyhedral cluster in the formed Ta monatomic MG. From another side, in terms of MRO, the icosahedral clusters are found to be connected via intercross-sharing (IS), face-sharing (FS), edge-sharing (ES) and vertex-sharing (VS). We have also found that the five-fold symmetry governs the formation of the amorphous state and may behaves as a principal indication of the formation of the glassy state during the cooling process. The ratio R-i /R-1/ of RDF obtained showed the presence of a hidden crystalline order in Ta monatomic MG, which can be interpreted by a combination between spherical- periodic order (SPO) and local translational symmetry (LTS). Furthermore, the atomic-level analysis of the structure revealed that the glass has a fractal dimension (D-f = 2.59) between the center atom and the first coordination shell, while beyond the first coordination shell D-f = 3.01, which suggests the development of fractal dimension at short distance.

AB The hybrid sol-gel coatings developed in the present work serve as corrosion protection of aluminium alloy AA7075 and are based on (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GPTMS), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and silica (SiO2) nanoparticles, with the addition of cerium nitrate as a corrosion inhibitor. However, it is not clear whether this protection results from the corrosion inhibition effect alone or from the cerium effect on the sol-gel network. Thus, the role of cerium addition as well as of curing temperature on the network structure was studied by several techniques. Liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Si-29 NMR) and solid-state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Si-29 MAS/NMR) were used to study the chemical composition and degree of polycondensation of inorganic and organic networks as a function of curing temperature and cerium content. The stability of sols was followed by measurements of viscosity and particle size, while the thermal stability of the two sols was determined by differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis.
   The addition of cerium leads to a higher degree of inorganic and organic polymerisation in the hybrid sol-gel coatings, especially at lower temperature.

AB A sequence of chalcogenide glassy alloys, xS-(1-x) (0.5Te-0.5Se) for x = 0.1, 0.14, 0.24 and 0.34 have been prepared using well-established melt quenching method. The XRD patterns reveal the existence of crystallinity, superimposing over the amorphous glassy matrix. The effects of increasing values of mean crystallite size and optical band gap energy with composition cause electrical conductivity to reduce. The DC conductivities of the present system have been explored using Mott and Greaves's variable range hopping model. The values of temperature dependent small polaron hopping distance (R-hop) and hopping energy (W-hop) are in agreement with the nature of DC conductivity. The anomaly of the sample for x = 0.14 may arise due to the lesser number of localized or defect states within the mobility gap and higher values of small polaron hopping distance and average hopping energy. The well-known Meyer-Neldel rule, Jonscher's Universal power-law and Almond-West formalism have been employed to investigate the AC conductivity spectra. The reducing nature of power-law exponent (s) with increasing temperature of the samples for x = 0.1 and 0.14 indicates that correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model is the best model for AC conduction mechanism. On the other hand, non-overlapping small polaron tunneling (NSPT) process is the suitable AC conduction mechanism of the samples for x = 0.24 and 0.34 due to the increasing nature of s with temperature. The conductivity scaling signifies temperature independency and composition dependency of electrical relaxation process.

AB The effect of substrate temperature on growth behavior and microstructure-properties correlation of magnetron sputtered Ni60Nb40 films were systematically investigated. With substrate temperature increasing from 293 K to 493 K, and thickness changing from 50 nm to 1 mu m, all films kept in amorphous state. The characteristic of columnar growth was clearly seen, with reduced interfacial fraction between adjacent columns and increased granule size at high substrate temperature. Through scaling analysis, films deposited at all temperatures grow in an anomalous roughening mode, and at 293 K for films thicker than 200 run, a difficult roughening phenomenon was revealed. High substrate temperature can facilitate the surface kinetic roughening. Both decreased interface fraction-to-volume ratio by particle coarsening and reduced free volume by structure relaxation caused the dense atomic atomic packing and increased density, which may be the crucial reason for enhanced mechanical properties and thermal stability against crystallization.

AB Chemically durable iron phosphate glasses are promising candidates for hosting nuclear wastes containing constituents like Cs2O and MoO3 that have lower solubility in more conventional borosilicate glasses. In this work, two series of Cs-Mo-Fe-phosphate glasses were prepared and characterized. For glasses in Series A (xCs(2)O center dot(100-x)center dot(15MoO(3)center dot 22.5Fe(2)O(3)center dot 62.5P(2)O(3)), x = 0, 7.5, 15.0, 22.5), increasing Cs2O contents increase the molar volume and decrease the glass transition temperature. Raman spectroscopy reveals that adding Cs2O breaks down linkages between MoO(6 )octahedra, replacing Mo-O-Mo and Mo=O bonds with Mo-O-Cs+ bonds. Phosphate anion chromatography reveals that adding Cs2O has little effect on the phosphate anion distributions. For glasses in Series B (15Cs(2)O center dot yMoO(3)center dot(28.75-y)Fe2O3 center dot 56.25P(2)O(5), y = 0, 5.75, 11.50, 17.25, 23.00, 28.75), the glass transition temperature decreases and the aqueous dissolution rates increase when MoO3 replaces Fe2O3. The formation of isolated MoO6 octahedra with Mo-O-Cs+ bonds results in an increase in the average phosphate anion-length in the MoO3 -rich glasses. Mossbauer spectroscopy indicates that ferric ions dominate in both series, and that the average Fe-coordination number increases with increasing Cs2O content (series A) and with increasing MoO3 content (series B).

AB Ion-exchange is a strengthening method employed to increase silicate glasses' wear resistance and fracture strength. The characterization of the residual stress-field introduced by the ion-exchange process is a crucial yet challenging problem particularly for shallow exchanged layers. In this work, an enhanced iterative etching method was proposed to more accurately characterize the residual stress-field in shallow, chemically-strengthened glasses. With iterative etching, sub-micron layers are removed from the free-surface of the glass and the local compressive stress is estimated by measuring the variation in the internal tensile stress. In this study, the proven iterative etching method was complemented by the latest phenomenological models describing both the ion-exchange and the stress relaxation processes, as well as by the improved modeling of the etching behavior of soda-lime glass. The approach substantially reduced the number of fitting parameters and provided a physically-truthful description of the stress profile. Finally, the residual stress-profile obtained in this work was compared to the predictions obtained by various optical and mechanical characterization techniques commonly used in the industry. Optical methods were found to be more reliable than mechanical methods for shallow, ion-exchanged glasses.

AB Raman and infrared spectroscopy were used to determine the structure of glasses for compositions xK(2)O-(100-x)GeO2, where x = 0, 10, 20, 30 40 mol%. Curve-fitting was applied to both medium- and high-frequency regions of the Raman spectra, and the main structural species formed in the system were defined. It was shown that the maximum of Ge(IV) -> Ge(VI) conversion occurs at a composition of about 20 mol% K2O. A further increase of modifier cation in glasses results in a decrease in the coordination number of Ge atoms. At the same time, there is a depolymerisation of the three-dimensional disordered network and formation of tetrahedra [GeO4] with one and two non-bridging oxygen atoms.

TI Effect of sulfate sequestration by Ba-Sn composite material on Re
   retention in low-activity waste glass
SO JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS
LA English
DT Article
ID RHENIUM
AB Incorporating radioactive Tc-99 into glass during vitrification of low-activity waste (LAW) at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site is a scientific challenge. Previous studies have suggested that the presence of sulfate salts in the melt hinder the incorporation of Re, a non-radioactive surrogate for Tc-99, into nuclear waste glass. In this study, we assessed the capability of a Ba-Sn composite material to sequester sulfate during vitrification of AN-102 LAW feed and the resulting effects on Re retention in the glass. We also investigated a feed in which the initial soluble sulfate source in the simulated LAW (Na2SO4) was replaced with insoluble BaSO4. The Ba-Sn composite-treated feed and BaSO4-substitute feed were compared to a control, AN-102 baseline. The feeds were prepared and then heated to temperatures ranging from 400 to 1000 degrees C at a 5 degrees C/min rate and then air-quenched to room temperature. The heated samples and dried feeds were leached in deionized water. The solutions from the leach test were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy to determine the amount of soluble sulfate as a function of temperature, and the resulting solids were analyzed for Re retention. Although the Ba-Sn composite material successfully sequestered sulfate in the as-prepared LAW feed, heating to 400 degrees C resulted in most of the sulfate partitioning to a soluble salt phase. By 700 degrees C, sulfate partitioning in the composite-treated feed was identical to that of the baseline feed. Throughout the entire temperature range, the BaSO4-substitute feed behaved similarly to the composite-treated feed. The results of the study show that sequestering sulfate in a BaSO4 phase is not effective for Re retention as the sulfate salt behavior was nearly identical in the three feeds at >= 700 degrees C. The fraction of Re retained in the glass at 1000 degrees C varied from 39.4 to 46.6% for the three feeds, which is shown to be a statistically insignificant difference.

AB All the properties of glass-ceramics are strongly dependent upon their nano or microstructure, including the percentage, composition and, structure of the residual glass phase. Unfortunately, however, determining the chemical composition of residual glass is far from trivial and there are very few publications on this matter. In this paper, we used electrical conductivity measurements by impedance spectroscopy to infer the composition of the residual glass in partially crystallized Li2SiO3-CaSiO3 glasses. The glass-ceramics were obtained by heattreatment at 560 degrees C for distinct periods, in conditions where only lithium-metasilicate (Li2SiO3) crystallized. Consequently, residual glasses of the resulting glass-ceramics became depleted in lithium, and their ionic conductivity and the respective activation energies changed accordingly. Therefore, we obtained the compositions of residual glasses by comparing the glass-ceramics ionic conductivities and activation energies with those of reference glasses having known chemical composition. We validated these two methods by comparing the obtained residual glass compositions with those obtained using a technique that relates the glass transition temperatures of reference glasses with those of glass-ceramics. These novel methods employing ionic conductivity and activation energy yield similar results to those obtained using the glass transition temperature method. However, the electrical property techniques are non-destructive and can be used to follow the crystallization process in situ.

AB Bi-activated glasses from the MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system with IR luminescence in the region of 1050-1600 nm have been studied by the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. It was found that individual bismuth ions are present in all samples. Presumably, these ions are Bi3+ with low coordination number in the glass network or the subvalent bismuth cations, namely Bi(+ )and Bi2+. An increase in the bismuth content, the synthesis temperature together with the change of the synthesis atmosphere from oxidizing (air) to the reducing (nitrogen) leads to the growth of the number of cluster with dimensions in the range of similar to 3 angstrom to similar to 6 angstrom. The bismuth dimers are very probable in the samples with a bismuth content close to 0.2 at.%. The clusters with bigger size (similar to 12 angstrom) are most likely to be neutral clusters (Bi-n)(0), which are nuclei for the nano-sized inclusions of the phase of metallic bismuth. In another type of agglomerate with Bi - Bi atoms distances close to 2-4 angstrom and more correspond the nano-regions enriched in Bi atoms where Bi atoms are embedded in the glass network.

AB Molybdenum is a fission product with high fission yield, present in High Level Liquid Waste (HLW). Presently HLW is confined in borosilicate glass matrix. To enhance the solubility of MoO3, different host glass matrices containing different amount of MoO3 were prepared and studied. Phosphate containing borosilicate glass showed increased solubility for MoO3. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) studies were carried out to check for presence of crystalline phase within glass samples. Phosphate containing glass samples could accommodate 4 mol% of MoO3 whereas in absence of phosphate only 1 mol% of MoO3 could be accommodated in borosilicate glass. Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) data was employed to confirm the homogeneity of MoO(3 )within the glass sample. Glass transition temperature was also observed for all the glass samples to study the effect of MoO3 on thermal stability.

AB The interaction of water with glass has a profound impact on its mechanical, chemical, and kinetic properties. Water can enter the glass network either as molecular form (H2O) or hydroxyl species (OH). The resulting impact of water on glass properties depends on the relative concentrations of hydroxyl to molecular species. While attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy can be used to determine the presence of these species in the subsurface region of glass, there is currently no approach to characterize their relative abundance in the glass surface. In this paper, we propose a calculating method for quantifying the ratio of hydroxyl to molecular water in silicate glasses based on a combination of ATR-IR spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The technique is applied to leached soda lime silicate and sodium aluminosilicate glasses under a variety of process conditions. The method presented in this paper offers a new avenue for understanding the multiple roles of water in silicate glass network structure and topology.

AB Several glass compositions of the Ge-As-S ternary system were prepared and their thermal and physical properties were investigated as T-g, T-d, theoretical drawing temperature T-s, viscous flow activation energy, density, visible and IR absorption coefficients. The measured values, which are in excellent agreement with the literature, were used to explore the drawing capability of the glass samples. In this work, we report wide range of Ge-As-S optical fiber compositions using the classical preform-to-fiber drawing technique. We show the possibility to obtain optical fibers with sulfur concentration ranging from 35 to 75%, and germanium concentration as high as 35%. In addition, based on the drawing tests we present a fiber drawing domain in the Ge-As-S ternary diagram. The attenuation losses measured at 1310 nm wavelength were between 8.4 and 12.3 dB/m.

AB A series of ten GexGaySe1-x-y glasses within the topological constraint regime of < r > = 2.3 to 2.8 were processed for physical property testing to compare measured to calculated property values enabling further understanding of structure-related mechanical property evolution. Average bond energies were calculated for each glass to elucidate structure and property relationships. Raman analysis was performed to correlate the topological constraint theory to experimentally determined structural units. Young's modulus and Vickers hardness, respectively, were shown to increase with increasing coordination number from 14.42 GPa and 911 MPa at < r > = 2.4 to 29.44 GPa and 2295 MPa at < r > = 2.8. Poisson's ratio decreased linearly with increasing coordination number from 0.2996 at < r > = 2.4 for Ge0.15Ga0.05Se0.85 to 0.2477 at < r > = 2.8 for Ge0.25Ga0.15Se0.60. These properties indicate a strong dependence on the topological network of the glass, in which continued crosslinking and interconnectivity lead to a direct increase or decrease of the respective mechanical property. It was found that theoretical values were in good agreement with measured experiment values, elucidating the impact of the energy required to propagate a crack tip or alter bond lengths and atom positions.

AB Developing a forward osmosis (FO) membrane with superior ammonia selectivity and robust antifouling performance is important for treating domestic wastewater (DW) but challenging due to the similar polarities and hydraulic radii of NH4+ and water molecules. Herein, we investigated the feasibility of using polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer to simultaneously enhance the ammonia rejection rate and antifouling capacity of the thin-film composite (TFC) FO membrane. PAMAM dendrimer with abundant, easily-protonated, terminal amine groups was grafted on TFC-FO membrane surface via covalent bonds, which inspired the TFC-FO membrane surface with appreciable Zeta potential (isoelectric point: pH = 5.5) and outstanding hydrophilicity (water contact angle: 39.83 +/- 0.57 degrees). Benefiting from the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated amine layer and NH4+-N as well as the concentration induced diffusion resistance, the introduction of PAMAM dendrimer endowed the grafted membrane with a superior NH4+-N rejection rate of 98.23% and a significantly reduced the reverse solute flux when using NH4Cl solutions as feed solution. Meanwhile, the perfect balance between the electrostatic repulsion to positively-charged micromoleculer ions (metal ions and NH4+-N) and the electrostatic attraction to negatively-charged macromolecular organic foulants together with the hydrophilic nature of amine groups facilitated the enhancement of the grafted membranes in antifouling capacity and hence the NH4+-N selectivity (rejection rate of 91.81%) during the concentration of raw DW. The overall approach of this work opens up a frontier for preparation of ammonia-selective and antifouling TFC-FO membrane. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When acidic groundwater flows into an aquatic system the sediment water interface (SWI) acts as a transition zone between the groundwater and lake water, and often exhibits strong physical and biogeochemical gradients. The fate of groundwater-borne solutes, such as Fe(II), is determined by the balance between the exposure time during transport across the SWI and the reaction time within the SWI, however the relative role of groundwater seepage rates and iron kinetics on acidity generation in lakes is unknown. Porewater seepage velocities, porewater chemical profiles, and limnological data were collected across multiple field campaigns over the last two decades, in acid Mine Lake 77, in Lusatia, Germany. This rare data set was analyzed using a DamkOhler approach that compares exposure and reactions timescales, to determine that Fe(II) would typically be transported with little reaction across the SWI, spatially separating it from sediment-processes that produce alkalinity and providing a source of acidity to the lake. This Damkohler analysis further showed that remediation should be focused on reducing groundwater seepage velocities and enhancing exposure times. Strategic planting of submerged benthic macroalgae would slow groundwater inflows, as well as oxygenating overlying waters and supplying organic matter to the sediments. A similar Damkohler analysis could be used to assess the fate of any groundwater-borne reactive chemicals (e.g. phosphorus) into lakes and streams. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Considerable amount of phosphorous is present as organic phosphonates (usually in the form of metal complexes, e.g., Ca(II)-phosphonate) in domestic and industrial effluents, which cannot be effectively removed by traditional processes for phosphate. Herein, we employed a proprietary process, i.e., Fe(III) displacement/UV irradiation/co-precipitation (denoted Fe(III)/UV/NaOH), to enable an efficient removal of Ca(II)-phosphonate complexes from water. The combined process includes three basic steps, i.e., Fe(III) replacement with the complexed Ca(II) to form Fe(III)-phosphonate of high photo-reactivity, UV-mediated degradation of Fe(III)-phosphonate to form phosphate and other intermediates, and the final phosphorous removal via co-precipitation at pH = 6. The operational conditions for the combined process to remove a typical phosphonate Ca(II)-NTMP (nitrilotrismethylenephosphonate) are optimized, where similar to 60% NTMP is transformed to phosphate with the total phosphorous reduction from 1.81 mg/L to 0.17 mg/L Under UV irradiation, the cleavage of NTMP is identified at the C-N and C-P bonds to form the intermediate products and phosphate in sequence. Also, the combined process is employed for treatment of two authentic effluents before and after activated sludge treatment, resulting in the phosphorous drop from 4.3 mg/L to 0.23 mg/L and from 0.90 mg/L to 0.14 mg/L respectively, which is much superior to other processes including Fenton/co-precipitation. In general, the combined process exhibits great potential for efficient removal of phosphonates from contaminated waters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from lakes have been proven to be an important component of the continental carbon balance, but most CO2 evasion estimates ignore daily variability of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)). To discern the variability of pCO(2) and its effect on CO2 outgassing estimations, we conducted in-situ biweekly pCO(2) measurements during daylight from November 2017 to June 2018 at 7:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 17:00 Central Standard Time of the United States (CST) in a subtropical shallow lake in Louisiana, USA. Daytime pCO(2) varied largely from 154 to 1698 mu atm with an average of 736 atm, while daytime CO2 flux ranged from -43 to 284 mmol m(2) h(-1) averaging at 44 mmol m(2) h(-1). Significant decreases in pCO(2) and CO2 fluxes from mornings to late afternoons were observed throughout the study period. Specifically, in morning hours average pCO(2) and CO2 fluxes were 940 atm and 83 mmol m(2) h(-1), respectively, while in afternoon hours average pCO(2) and CO2 fluxes were only 410 mu atm and 6 mmol m(2) h(-1), respectively. Relationships between pCO(2) and ambient factors reveal that solar radiation, lake trophic status and water temperature play a major role in pCO(2) and CO2 dynamics in lake water. We argue that uncertainties may exist in the current regional and global CO2 evasion estimates due to this high daily pCO(2) variability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorus has been considered as a pollutant to be removed from the wastewater. In the last years, however, it has been considered a valuable asset that needs to be recovered due to its shortage in nature. The study of optimum phosphorus management in wastewater treatment plants is not straightforward, due to the complexity of technologies and configurations that may be applied for phosphorus removal and recovery. In this context, plant-wide mathematical modelling and simulation tools are very useful for carrying out these studies. This paper introduces a study carried out at the Sur WWTP (Madrid) to assess optimum phosphorus management strategies based on the PWM. The mathematical model made it possible to describe the phosphorus flux and its characterization throughout the plant. Finally, an exploration by simulation with WEST (TM) was carried out to analyse different plant configurations and different operational strategies to optimize phosphorus management strategies in the Sur WWTP.

AB In many low-income countries, the poor conditions of sanitation systems have been a significant cause of mortality since they accelerate waterborne disease transmission. Developing sanitation systems in these countries is a pressing concern in both the public and private sectors.
   This research investigated a decentralized domestic wastewater treatment system using ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs). Although UV-LED disinfection has become more widespread in recent years, it is a novel approach for domestic wastewater treatment. Domestic wastewater was pretreated by a low-cost pretreatment system with an inclined settler and a sand filter prior to feeding a novel flow-through UV LED reactor. At an inlet flow rate of 30 L/h, the COD, TSS, and turbidity of the effluent were 17.7 mg/I, 3.0 mg/I, and 3.9 NTU, respectively. UV transmittance at 285 nm was enhanced from 29.1% to 70.4%, improving the influent quality for UV LED disinfection.
   The flow-through UV LED reactor was operated at various flow rates from 10 to 50 mL/min, resulting in applied UV doses of 69.4 to 47.8 mJ/cm(2) respectively. These doses are sufficient for inactivating total coliforms in the wastewater to meet the water reuse guidelines for agriculture for both processed food crops and non-food crops.
   Fouling, which was observed starting at 2 d of operation, decreased the disinfection efficacy to 27% after 25 days of continuous operation. Of the fouling layer, 67% was attributed to organic matter, in contrast to previous fouling studies with mercury UV lamps in which the fouling layer consisted primarily of inorganic compounds. The fouling was reversed by off-line citric acid cleaning for 4 h after every 400 h of continuous operation. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Within developing countries, wastewater treatment (WWT) has improved in recent years but remains a high priority sustainability challenge. Accordingly, life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have recently started to analyse the environmental impacts of WWT technologies on the specific context of less developed countries, mainly in China and India. This work presents a comprehensive review of this knowledge with the aim of critically analysing the main conclusions, gaps and challenges for future WWT-related LCAs in developing countries. The most commonly assessed technologies in the 43 reviewed articles are different variations of activated sludge and extensive treatments applied in decentralized systems; however, studies focused on advanced technologies or new sources of pollution (e.g. micropollutants) are still lacking. Goal and system boundaries are normally clearly defined, but significant stages for some technologies such as the construction and sludge management are frequently not included and functional units should be defined accordingly to specific conditions in developing countries. At the inventory level, a more concise description of sources and technical parameters would greatly improve the quality of the LCAs along with accountability of direct greenhouse gas emissions. Eutrophication and global warming are the two most commonly assessed impacts; however, the calculation of terrestrial ecotoxicity when the sludge is used for agricultural purposes, of water use and of the land use change impacts associated to extensive technologies should be encouraged. The estimation of more site-specific databases, characterization factors (especially for eutrophication) or normalization and weighting values combined with more affordable access to background databases and LCA software, would deeply increase the accuracy of WWT-related LCAs in developing countries. An increased usage of the uncertainty analysis should be encouraged to assess the influence of these gaps in the final interpretation of the results. The review finishes with a summary of the main challenges and research gaps identified and with specific guidelines for future researchers to avoid the most common shortcomings found in the reviewed studies.

AB The release of persistent and mobile organic chemicals (PMOCs) into the aquatic environment puts the quality of water resources at risk. PMOCs are challenging to analyze in water samples, due to their high polarity. The aim of this study was to develop novel analytical methods for PMOCs and to investigate their occurrence in surface and groundwater samples. The target compounds were culled from a prioritized list of industrial chemicals that were modeled to be persistent, mobile, and emitted into the environment. Analytical screening methods based on mixed-mode liquid chromatography (LC), hydrophilic interaction LC, reversed phase LC, or supercritical fluid chromatography in combination with mass spectrometric detection were successfully developed for 57 target PMOCs and applied to 14 water samples from three European countries. A total of 43 PMOCs were detected in at least one sample, among them 23 PM0C5 that have not been reported before to occur in environmental waters. The most prevalent of these novel PMOCs were methyl sulfate, 2-acrylamino-2-methylpropane sulfonate, benzyltrimethylammonium, benzyldimethylamine, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, 6-methyl-1,3,5-triazinediamine, and 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine occurring in >= 50% of the samples at estimated concentrations in the low ng L-1 up to mu g L-1 range. The approach of focused prioritization combined with sensitive target chemical analysis proved to be highly efficient in revealing a large suite of novel as well as scarcely investigated PMOCs in surface and groundwater.

AB Wastewater is an important resource in water-scarce regions of the world, and its use in agriculture requires the guarantee of acceptable public health risks. The use of fecal indicator bacteria to evaluate safety does not represent viruses, the main potential health hazards. Viral pathogens could complement the use of fecal indicator bacteria in the evaluation of water quality. In this study, we characterized the concentration and removal of human adenovirus (HAdV) and norovirus genogroup II (NoV GII), highly abundant and important viral pathogens found in wastewater, in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that use different tertiary treatments (constructed wetland vs conventional UV, chlorination and Actiflo (R) treatments) for a year in Catalonia. The main objective of this study was to develop a Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment for viral gastroenteritis caused by norovirus GIL and adenovirus, associated with the ingestion of lettuce irrigated with tertiary effluents from these WWTPs. The results show that the disease burden of NoV GII and HAdV for the consumption of lettuce irrigated with tertiary effluent from either WWTP was higher than the WHO recommendation of 10(-6) DALYs for both viruses. The WWTP with constructed wetland showed a higher viral reduction on average (3.9 and 2.8 logs for NoV GII and HAdV, respectively) than conventional treatment (1.9 and 2.5 logs) but a higher variability than the conventional WWTP. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the input parameters used to estimate the viral reduction by treatment and viral concentrations accounted for much of the model output variability. The estimated reductions required to reach the WHO recommended levels in tertiary effluent are influenced by the characteristics of the treatments developed in the WWTP5, and additional average reductions are necessary (in WWTP with a constructed wetland: A total of 6.7 and 5.1 logs for NoV GII and HAdV, respectively; and in the more conventional treatment: 7 and 5.6 logs). This recommendation would be achieved with an average quantification of 0.5 genome copies per 100 mL in reclaimed water for both viruses. The results suggest that the analyzed reclaimed water would require additional treatments to achieve acceptable risk in the irrigation of vegetables with reclaimed water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) -based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) have proven effective for simultaneously removing refractory dissolved organic matter (DOM) and ammonia in municipal landfill leachates. However, the knowledge on the competition of leachate DOM and ammonia for SO4 center dot-, the utilization efficiency of persulfate, as well as the reaction pathways and final products of ammonia oxidation during the SR-AOP treatment remains little known, thereby leading to a lack of a comprehensive evaluation of the emerging leachate treatment technology. The objective of this study was to further investigate the performance of a thermally activated persulfate system for treatment of a mature landfill leachate and re-evaluate the benefits and restrictions of SR-AOPs for leachate treatment. The laboratory experimental results showed that removal patterns of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia relied heavily upon the dose of persulfate that could be thermally activated to produce reactive sulfate radicals, reflecting the competition of leachate DOM, ammonia, and non-target leachate constituents for SO4 center dot-. The utilization efficiency of the added persulfate could be more efficiently utilized for removing the two target leachate pollutants at a lower persulfate dose, whereas more persulfate was wasted due to the reactions with non-target leachate constituents (e.g. Cl- and CO32-) and/or self decomposition with the increasing persulfate dose. During the treatment, ammonia was oxidized, via the direct attack of SO4 center dot- and/or by molecular chlorine produced from the reactions of chloride and sulfate radicals, into nitrate and nitrogen gas, while nitrite was not detected. Of importance, this study highlighted three potentially negative impacts of SR-A0P5 on the quality of treated leachate, including accumulation of total dissolved solids, the production of undesirable nitrate, and the pH decrease due to the continuous formation of hydrochloric acid. Therefore, the three issues should be carefully evaluated when a SR-AOP is selected for leachate treatment. Because these impacts become less pronounced with a decreasing persulfate dose, SR-AOPs as a pre-treatment, which is achieved at a relatively low persulfate dose, may be an appropriate option for the SR-AOP application to leachate treatment.

AB Calibrated adsorption-based passive samplers were used for time-integrative monitoring of microcystins (MCs) in three full-scale drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in the Czech Republic during two vegetation seasons (Jun-Nov), in parallel with traditional discrete sampling. MCs were detected in epilimnetic water samples at concentrations up to 14 mu g/L, but their levels in raw water in DWTPs were below 1 mu g/L WHO guideline value for drinking water. Conventional treatment technologies (coagulation/filtration) eliminated cyanobacteria and intracellular toxins but had a limited removal efficiency for extracellular toxins. MCs were regularly detected in final treated water, especially in DWTPs equipped only with the conventional treatment, but their concentrations were below the quantitation limit of discrete sampling (<25 ng/L). Passive samplers in combination with LC-MS/MS analysis provided excellent sensitivity allowing to detect time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of MCs as low as 20-200 pg/L after 14-d deployment. Median MC TWA concentrations in the treated water from the individual DWTP5 were 1-12 ng/L, and most likely did not present significant health risks. Passive samplers well reflected spatiotemporal variations of MCs, actual concentrations of extracellular toxins, MC removal efficiency in DWTP5, and toxin concentrations in the treated water. Passive sampling can be effectively used for assessment and management of MC health risks during DWTP operation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global aquatic ecosystems are essential to human existence and have deteriorated seriously in recent years. Understanding the influence mechanism of habitat variation on the structure of the food-web allows the effective recovery of the health of degraded ecosystems. Whereas most previous studies focused on the selection of driving habitat factors, the impact of habitat variation on the food-web structure was rarely studied, resulting in the low success rate of ecosystem restoration projects globally. This paper presents a framework for exploring the effects of spatial variations in water quality and hydrological habitat factors on the food-web structure in city waters. Indices for the evaluation of the food-web structure are first determined by integrating model-parameter extraction via literature refinement. The key water quality and hydrological factors are then determined by coupling canonical correspondence analysis with partial least squares regression. Their spatial variation is investigated using spatial autocorrelation. Finally, fuzzy clustering is applied to analyze the influence of the spatial variations in water quality and hydrological factors on the food-web structure. The results obtained in Ji'nan, the pilot city of water ecological civilization in China, show that the Shannon diversity index, connectance index, omnivory index, and the ratio of total primary production to the total respiration are important indicators of food-web structural change. They show that the driving factors affecting the aquatic food-web structure in Ji'nan are hydrological factors (e.g., river width, water depth, and stream flow), physical aspects of water quality (e.g., air temperature, water temperature, electrical conductivity, and transparency), and chemical aspects (e.g., potassium, dissolved oxygen, calcium, and total hardness). They also show that the stability of the food-web is more prone to spatial variations in water quality than in hydrological factors. Higher electrical conductivity, potassium, total hardness, and air temperature lead to deteriorated food-web structures, whereas better transparency improves structure and stability. We found that water and air temperature are the most important factors in the spatial variation of the food-web structure in the study area, followed by total hardness. Transparency is the least important factor. Large disparities and varied spatial distributions exist in the driving effects of water quality and hydrological factors across regions attributable to differences in geographical environments, water salinity (fresh vs. sea water), and environmental factors (e.g., water pollution). The above methods and results serve as a theoretical and scientific basis for a high success rate of aquatic ecosystem restoration projects in the study area and other cities worldwide.

AB This study evaluates a treatment system centered on forward osmosis (FO) to extract high-quality water from real brackish groundwater and wastewater. The groundwater had salinity of 4g/L, while the wastewater sample consisted of a secondary effluent. These feed solutions were treated first in a FO step, achieving a recovery of >60%. Subsequently, the diluted draw solutions were subject to a nanofiltration (NF) step to regenerate their original osmotic pressure and to simultaneously collect a final permeate product. Magnesium chloride and sodium sulfate were both suitable draw solutes for this application. MgCl2 had a larger specific reverse salt flux and induced a more pronounced fouling-related flux decline with groundwater samples. Na2SO4 was re-concentrated with a higher permeability NF membrane but may require the use of anti-scalants. The average fluxes obtained in high-recovery batch FO were between 5 and 11 L m(-2)h(-1) with an initial bulk draw osmotic pressure in the range of 12-15 bar. Relatively low flux decline was observed in fouling experiments with both samples, while physical cleaning proved promising to recover the related loss in productivity. The final product waters were all of very high quality, suggesting the potential of this coupled system for water reuse and desalination. Some challenges related to the relatively low water flux in the FO step, as well as the loss of draw solutes and the gradual change in composition of the draw solution, need further analysis to establish the technical and economic feasibility of the system.

AB Antibiotics have been frequently detected in the aquatic environment and are of emerging concern due to their adverse effect and potential of inducing antibiotic resistance. In this study, we developed an UV/pre-magnetized Fe-0/H2O2 process (UV/pre-Fe-0/H2O2) valid for neutral pH conditions, which could remove sulfamethazine (SMT) completely within only 30 min and enhance 1.8 times of SMT removal. Meanwhile, this process demonstrated outstanding mineralization capability with the TOC removal of 92.1%, while for UV/H2O2 and UV/Fe-0/H2O2 system it was 53.9% and 72.1%, respectively. Better synergetic effect between UV irradiation and pre-Fe-0/H2O2 system was observed, and the value of synergetic factor was 6.3 in the presence of both ions and humic acid, which was much higher than that in deionized water (4.4), humic acid (5.5) and ions (1.5). Moreover, the process could efficiently remove various antibiotics (800 mu g L-1 oxytetracycline (OTC); 800 mu g L-1 tetracycline (TC); 400 mu g L-1 sulfadiazine (SD) and 400 mu g L-1 SMT) in the secondary wastewater effluent. After optimization of Fe and H2O2 dosage, these antibiotics could be removed within 10 min (k(app) (10(3)) = 288.6 min(-1)) with a very low treatment cost of 0.1 USD m(-3), and the EE/O value was only 1.22 kWh m(-3). Compared with O-3, UV/Fe2+/PDS, VUV/UV/Fe2+ and other US-based processes, the degradation rates by this process could enhance as high as 22.3 folds while the treatment cost or EE/O value could reduce greatly. Therefore, UV/pre-Fe-0/H2O2 process is promising and cost-effective for the treatment of antibiotics in secondary wastewater effluents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oil Contaminated Seawaters is treated by biological processes of sorption or degradation. Considering the chemotaxis of bacteria, they migrate towards a better way to survive. However, the information concerning the chemotactic biosorption of microorganism is severely limited thus far. Therefore, chemotactic biosorption a novel way of sorption was put forward. The equation was defined as: A (chemotactic) (biosorption) = A (extracellular biosorption) - A (passive extracellular biosorption) + E (intracellular). Effects of controlling parameters like pollutant, fertilizer, sediments and surfactant on bacterial chemotactic sorption capacity of tetradecane, hexadecane, phenanthrene or pyrene were described in detail. The results showed bacterial chemotactic biosorption would be promoted under the conditions of low pollutant concentration, high sediment concentration and fertilizer. However, Tween 80 would promote the sorption of pollutants onto bacterial cells depending on the concentration of surfactant. Correlational analyses were conducted with the biodegradation rate and the concentration (mg/g) of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass. We concluded there existed great correlation between them. Biodegradation rate were all linearly correlated with the concentration (mg/g) of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass in all respects with tetradecane (R-2 = 0.9873), hexadecane (R-2 = 0.9705), phenanthrene (R-2 = 0.9098) and pyrene (R-2 = 0.9424). The above idea may provide a new insight into oil spill bioremediation from sorption to degradation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A nationwide survey was conducted on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in precipitation across mainland China. Twenty-two PFASs, including precursors to perfluoroalkyl acids (pre-PFAAs), were investigated in thirty-nine precipitation samples collected from twenty-eight cities. Trifluoroacetate (TFA), perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were ubiquitous in precipitation. TFA displayed the highest concentrations (8.8-1.8 x 10(3) ng/L), which were particularly elevated in coastal cities. 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid, an alternative to PFOS, was detected for the first time in precipitation at a frequency of 43%. Polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diesters and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid were also occasionally detected. PFAS fluxes in the northeastern area (C4-C12; 2.0 x 10(2)-3.4 x 10(3) ng/m(2)/d) with major PFAS manufacturing facilities were higher than those in the southwestern area (63-1.7 x 10(3) ng/m(2)/d). Using total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay, the occurrence of unknown pre-PFAAs was for the first time uncovered in precipitation with maximum estimated fluxes of C6 and C8 pre-PFAAs at 3.1 x 10(3) and 4.3 x 10(3) ng/m(2)/d, respectively. The relative contribution of ultrashort-chain PFCAs (C2-C3) ranged from 22% to 91% of Sigma PFASs, while unknown pre-PFAAs accounted for 6%-56% of the total molar concentrations of PFASs. This bears critical concerns on underestimation of PFAS mass load from precipitation to surface environment ascribed to monitoring data solely on known PFASs. Unknown precursors of PFAAs in the atmosphere are yet to be identified for their chemical structures and relevant environmental risks as well. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Benzophenones (BPs), which are widely used UV filters, have aroused considerable public concern owing to their potential endocrine-disrupting activities. Herein, we systematically investigated their photochemical behavior and fate, which is mediated by nitrate in aquatic environments. The results showed that 10 AM of 3 BPs can be completely degraded within 4 h of simulated sunlight irradiation in a 10 mM nitrate solution at pH 8.0, and 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) has a 31.6% mineralization rate after 12 h irradiation. Their photolytic rates (k(obs)) presented a significant linear correlation with the logarithmic values of the nitrate concentration for 0.1-10 mM (R-2 > 0.98), and in three actual waters, the rates of BP-1 were also positively related to the intrinsic nitrate concentration. Furthermore, higher transformation rates under alkaline condition were observed, especially for BP-1, with its kobs at pH 10 being 8.3-fold higher than that at pH 6.0. Moreover, dissolved oxygen (DO) also has an impact on the reaction kinetics to some degree. According to the quenching experiments, we found that three reactive oxygen species (ROS), namely, center dot OH, center dot NO, and center dot NO2, participated in this photolysis of BPs, and the contribution of center dot OH accounted for 32.1%. Furthermore, we selected BP-1 as the model molecule to study the transformation pathways and toxicity changes in this system. Four main transformation pathways including hydroxylation, nitrosylation, nitration, and dimerization were proposed, based on liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) analysis and density functional theory (DFT). According to the toxicity test, the formed intermediates were more toxic to Photobacterium phosphoreum than the parent BP-1. Therefore, these results can help reveal primary phototransformation mechanisms and evaluate the potential ecological risks of BPs in aquatic environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Estimation of phytoplankton biomass (noted as phytoplankton carbon, C-phyto) and evaluation of phytoplankton physiology is central to the estimation of primary productivity and the carbon cycle. This issue has been widely considered in oceans but not in inland water. Here, we develop experiential and semi analytical models, which validated by independent in situ measurement data, respectively, to derive C-phyto and phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 675 nm (a(ph)(675)) from MODIS. The effects of nutrients and temperature on the seasonal variation of phytoplankton physiology were assessed through a novel proxy of C-phyto to a(ph)(675) ratio (C-phyto/a(ph)(675)) over the Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in China. Significant seasonal climatological cycles of C-phyto, a(ph)(675) and C-phyto/a(ph)(675) were observed in Lake Taihu, especially in Meiliang Bay and Zhushan Bay, where algal blooms occur frequently. The highest C-phyto and a(ph)(675) values were observed in summer due to the growth of phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll-a concentration. Lower values were observed in winter and spring, which are characterized by relatively high total nitrogen levels and low irradiance, owing to the low temperature astricts the algae growth. However, the C-phyto/a(ph)(675) shows an opposite trend compared to C-phyto and a(ph)(675), which have high values in winter and low values in summer. The analysis of C-phyto, a(ph)(675) and C-phyto/aph(675) with total phosphorus (TP) levels and temperature indicates that TP are the main positive driver of the increase in C-phyto and a(ph)(675) and negatively regulate C-phyto/a(ph)(675). Warming promotes an increase in C-phyto and a(ph)(675) and restricts C-phyto/a(ph)(675) in summer. Biomass and nutrient levels are the primary drivers of the decrease of C-phyto/a(ph)(675) in such a typical eutrophic lake. The results present some new findings compared to previous oceanic studies and expand our knowledge in the study of phytoplankton biomass and physiology in eutrophic lakes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, a manganese(IV) oxide-mediator (MnO2-mediator) system for the abatement of sulfonamide antibiotics was evaluated. Two simple model humic constituents, syringaldehyde (SA) and acetosyringone (AS), could promote the transformation of sulfonamides at pH 5-8. Two additional potential mediators, tannic acid and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS), had negligible enhancement on the transformation of sulfonamides by MnO2. The enhancing effect was attributed to the reaction of the oxidized mediator (i.e., phenoxy radical or benzoquinone-like compounds) produced from the oxidation of the mediators by MnO2 with SMX. Thereby cross-coupling products from sulfamethoxazole (SMX) with oxidized SA were formed in the MnO2-SA system, which was confirmed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Coexisting metal ions (i.e., Ca(II), Mg(II) and Mn(II)) showed inhibitory effects in the order of Mn(II)> Ca(II)> Mg(II). For repetitive runs of the MnO2-SA-SMX system, MnO2 lost its oxidative capacity due to the sorption of Mn(II) on the reactive sites of the MnO2 surface. A full regeneration of partially deactivated MnO2 by oxidation of the sorbed Mn(II) with Mn(VII) could be achieved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphate, which contains the essential element phosphorous (P), is a necessary fertilizer for agriculture, but the current phosphate deposits are running out and alternative sources are needed. Sludge obtained from wastewater treatment plants contains high concentrations of phosphorus and represents an alternative, sustainable source. In this study, sludge obtained from a wastewater treatment plant with biological and chemical phosphorus removal was acidified (pH = 3, 4, 5 and 6) to release orthophosphate followed by sequestration of the orthophosphate by a zinc aluminum layered double hydroxide (Zn2Al-LDH). Sulfuric acid (H2SO4), nitric acid (HNO3), and hydrochloric acid (HCl) was tested, which showed that only sulfate anions compete with phosphate and results in reduced phosphate recovery (25-35%). The orthophosphate concentration in the liquid phase increased from 20% (raw sludge) to 75% of the total phosphorus concentration at a pH of 3, which enhanced the phosphate uptake by the ZnAl-LDH from 1.7 +/- 0.2% to 60.3 +/- 0.6%. During acidification, the competing anion carbonate is degassed as CO2, which further improved the phosphate uptake. PXRD showed the intercalation of carbonate in the LDH in the raw sludge at pH = 8, whereas orthophosphate was intercalated at lower pH values. Al-27 MAS NMR spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) proved preservation of the LDH at all pH values. Furthermore, about a fourth of the Al is present as an amorphous aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) upon exposure to phosphate at low pH (pH = 3 and 5) based on Al-27 MAS NMR spectroscopy. At a pH of 6 about a third of the P is present as brushite (CaHPO4 center dot 2H(2)O). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Poly aluminum chloride (PAC), an inorganic coagulant being accumulated in waste activated sludge (WAS) at substantial levels, are generally thought to inhibit WAS anaerobic fermentation. However, its effect on dark fermentative hydrogen accumulation has not been documented. This work therefore aimed to explore its effect on hydrogen accumulation and to elucidate the mechanism of how PAC affects hydrogen accumulation. Experimental results showed that with an increase of PAC addition from 0 to 20 mg Al per gram of total suspended solids (TSS), the maximal hydrogen yield from alkaline fermentation (pH 9.5) increased from 20.9 mL to 27.4 mL per gram volatile suspended solids (VSS) under the standard condition. Further increase of PAC to 30 mg Al/g T55 didn't cause a significant increase of hydrogen yield (p > 0.05). The mechanism explorations revealed that although PAC reduced the total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, this reduction was mainly enforced to propionic acid fermentation type, which did not contribute hydrogen production. PAC suppressed all the microbial processes relevant to anaerobic fermentation to some extents, but its inhibition to hydrogen consumption was much severer than that to hydrogen production. Illumina Miseq sequencing analysis revealed that PAC did not affect the populations of SCFA and hydrogen producers, but the two hydrogen consumers, Acetoanaerobium and Desulfobulbus, were almost washed out by PAC. Among the three types of Al species present in the anaerobic fermentation systems, Ala (monomeric species) significantly affected the maximal hydrogen production potential while Alb (medium polymer species) and Alc (species of sol or gel) posed impacts on hydrogen production rate and the lag time.

AB A comparative investigation of hydroxide precipitation, sulfide precipitation, carbonate precipitation and the struvite formation process for removing manganese and ammonia nitrogen from electrolytic metal manganese residue leachate (EMMRL) was investigated. Chemical equilibrium model-Visual MINTEQ was applied to simulate the chemical reactions and optimize chemical dosages in manganese and ammonia nitrogen removal. Phase transition, morphology, and valence state of the precipitates were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Results indicated that carbonate precipitation prior to the other two methods for removal of manganese and ammonia nitrogen. The removal efficiency of manganese was 99.9%, when molar ratio of C to Mn was 1.1:1 at pH 9.5, and manganese was removed in the form of MnCO3. When molar ratio of P to N was 1.1:1 at pH 9.5, the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was 97.4%, and ammonia nitrogen was removed in the form of struvite. Economic evaluation reveals that the treatment cost was 9.316 $ m(-3) when carbonate and phosphate was used to remove manganese and ammonia nitrogen from EMMRL. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Are piped water services reaching poor households? Empirical evidence

AB The delivery of water services to the poor is lagging, yet local causes and manifestations of this are not well understood. Better data is needed to identify inequalities where they occur, explore underlying reasons, and develop strategies to achieve more equitable access. A focus on the local scale is important because this is where water services are delivered, and inequalities in access can be best observed. This paper presents a mixed-methods study of poor households' access to piped water in rural Viet Nam, providing insight into local dynamics of the water/poverty nexus. Findings pointed to lower rates of piped water access for poor households across areas served by government, private and community service providers. Connection fees were found to be the primary barrier to poor households accessing available piped services. The study also found that where financial support is provided, poor households can achieve comparable or even higher rates of access. Key implications of the study are the demonstrated value of, and yet challenges associated with, rigorous local-level monitoring to ensure equitable, quality service delivery. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Advanced control of chemical disinfection processes is becoming increasingly important in view of balancing under-treatment (low pathogen inactivation) and over-treatment (excessive consumption of disinfectant and disinfection byproducts formation) thereby providing considerable environmental and economic benefits. Conventional control strategies such as flow pacing or residual trim ignore chemical demand/decay, inactivation kinetics, and other factors governing disinfection performance in continuous-flow reactors such as reactor hydraulics and process variability. This study presents the development, verification, and pilot-scale validation of a novel CT-based real-time disinfection control strategy, derived from first principles, and applied to peracetic acid disinfection of municipal secondary effluent wastewater. Validation experiments were carried out using a 3-m(3) pilot contact basin of which the hydraulic performance was first characterized by means of tracer tests and then mathematically modeled using the well-established theoretical framework of continuous stirred-tank reactors in series. The analytical model describing hydraulic performance was subsequently extended to take into account disinfectant demand/decay and microbial inactivation kinetics. The integrated model was successfully used to predict, and control, residual peracetic acid as well as microbial concentration in the pilot effluent. Validation studies conclusively supported that the novel CT-based control strategy was superior in maintaining constant disinfection performance, desired microbial counts, and low residual disinfectant under variable flow and wastewater quality. When compared with flow pacing, the CT-based control required two times less the amount of chemical for the same treatment objective (<100 cfu/100 mL). Remarkably, the CT-based control strategy could be extended to other chemical disinfection processes such as chlorination and ozonation, alone or in combination with physical treatment technologies such as membranes and ultraviolet irradiation.

AB Coliphage have been proposed as indicators of fecal contamination in recreational waters because they better reflect the persistence of pathogenic viruses in the environment and through wastewater treatment than traditional fecal indicator bacteria. Herein, we conducted a systematic literature search of peer-reviewed publications to identify coliphage density data (somatic and male-specific, or MSC) in raw wastewater and ambient waters. The literature review inclusion criteria included scope, study quality, and data availability. A non-parametric two-stage bootstrap analysis was used to estimate the coliphage distributions in raw wastewater and account for geographic region and season. Additionally, two statistical methodologies were explored for developing coliphage density distributions in ambient waters, to account for the nondetects in the datasets. In raw wastewater, the analysis resulted in seasonal density distributions of somatic coliphage (SC) (mean 6.5 log(10) plaque forming units (PFU)/L; 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.2-6.8) and MSC (mean 5.9 log(10) PFU/L; 95% CI: 5.5-6.1). In ambient waters, 49% of MSC samples were nondetects, compared with less than 5% for SC. Overall distributional estimates of ambient densities of coliphage were statistically higher for SC than for MSC (mean 3.4 and 1.0 log(10) PFU/L, respectively). Distributions of coliphage in raw wastewater and ambient water will be useful for future microbial risk assessments. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study has demonstrated that hydroxylamine (HA) could greatly enhance Cu nanoparticles (nCu) in activating molecular oxygen and significantly elevate the diclofenac (DCF) degradation rate about two orders of magnitude in neutral circumstances. Effects of several important parameters on the DCF degradation such as nCu loading, HA dosage, pH and reaction temperature were investigated in the nCu/HA/O-2 system. Multiple examinations revealed that the reactive Cu(III) species instead of OH center dot would be predominant in the nCu/HA/O-2 system, despite their similar DCF degradation pathways. Based on a HA-enhanced copper cycle depending on the pristine Cu-0@Cu(I) (hydro)oxides core-shell structure, the heterogeneous-homogeneous reaction mechanism was proposed. It included solid-liquid interfacial and bulk reactions, e.g. heterogeneous activation of O-2 by Cu(I) to produce H2O2 and homogeneous Cu(I)-catalytic generation of Cu(III) from H2O2. Further quantitative investigation of the main reactive species in the cycle revealed that the Cu(I) regeneration instead of the O-2 activation would be rate-limited. Besides, nCu could be recycled to effectively degrade DCF in four consecutive cycles in the raw neural nCu/HA/O-2 system. It suggested that the nCu/HA/O-2 system with a more efficient copper cycle would be a good alternative Fenton-like system in treating neutral recalcitrant organic wastewaters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As obligate anaerobes, anammox bacteria are sensitive to oxygen, which might hinder the maximization of anammox activity. However, there are very few effective strategies to rapidly recover anammox activity after its deterioration under exposure of oxygen. In this study, the activity recovery of anammox bacteria encountering dissolved oxygen (DO) exposure (0.2 and 2.0 mg L-1) were compared by three strategies in short-term experiments, nZVI, Fe(II) dosing, and N-2 purging. nZVI is more effective in recovering anammox activity with a high DO exposure (2 mg L-1), compared to a low DO exposure (0.2 mg L-1). After inhibiting by 2.0 mg L-1 DO, anammox activity recovery (normalized to the control) was ranked in the order of nZVI (5 mg L-1) addition (63 +/- 8.2%) > Fe(II) (5 mg L-1) addition (41 +/- 8.0%) >N-2 purging (39 +/- 4.0%). In contrast to Fe(II) ion additions, the shell structure of nZVI combined with the buffering effect of biomass-extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) prevented the sharp pH variation and excessive dissolved Fe(II)/Fe(III) in solution. Under such circumstances, nZVI addition (5 and 25 mg L-1) increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) to a moderate level (<200%), which might be responsible for the better activity recovery of anammox than that of Fe(II) addition and N-2 purging. Specifically, 5 mg L-1 nZVI dosage moderately enhanced the intracellular O-2(-) production (similar to 150% of the control) after scavenging 2.0 mg L-1 DO, and the anammox activity recovered better than that of both 5 and 25 mg L-1 Fe(II) ions additions. However, high dosage nZVI (75 mg L-1) inhibited anammox activity in spite of low or high DO exposure. Our findings elucidate that appropriate amount of nZVI (short-term dosing) can rapidly recover anammox activity when anammox bacteria encountering oxygen exposure accidentally and could be useful in facilitating the robust operation of anammox-based processes.

AB Bioremediation is a sustainable and cost-effective means of contaminant detoxification. Although Cr(VI) is toxic at high concentrations, various microbes can utilise it as an electron accepter in the bioremediation process, and reduce it to the less toxic form Cr(III). During remediation, it is important to monitor the level of toxicity and effectiveness of Cr(VI) reduction in order to optimize the conditions. This study employed a whole-cell bioreporter Acinetobacter baylyi ADPWH-recA to access the degree of toxicity of different species of Cr over a range of initial concentrations. It also investigated whether Cr isotope fractionation factors were impacted by different levels of Cr toxicity (related to its concentration) and Cr(VI) reduction rates by Cr resistant bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens LB 300. The results show that, of both Cr2O72- and CrO42-, the whole-cell bioreporter was efficient in indicating the level of genotoxicity of Cr(VI) at low concentrations and cytotoxicity at high concentrations via variations of bioluminescence. High concentrations (> 100 mg/L) of Cr(III) could also strongly induce the luminescence in the bioreporter, indicating DNA damage at such abundance. Pseudomonas fluorescens LB 300 was found to be effective in reducing Cr(VI) even when the concentration was high (40 mg/L); however, complete Cr(VI) reduction was only observed at low concentrations (< 5 mg/L), since the toxicity of high concentrations of Cr(VI) impacted the effectiveness of reduction by the bacteria. During reduction, the Cr-53/Cr-52 ratio of remaining Cr(VI) increased from its initial value, and the calculated fractionation factor by bacterial Cr(VI) reduction (epsilon) was -3.1 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand. The fractionation factor was independent of the initial Cr(VI) concentration. Therefore, a single Cr isotope fractionation factor can be effectively applied in indicating the extent of bioremediation processing of Cr(VI) over a wide range of concentrations. This significantly simplified monitoring of Cr(VI) depletion in bioremediation, since variations of e normally indicate a change in the reduction mechanism and therefore would complicate the elucidation of processes driving the remediation.

TI Explaining virtual water trade: A spatial-temporal analysis of the

AB The well-known "virtual water hypothesis" states that water-deficient regions/countries could alleviate water stress through importing water-intensive products from water-abundant regions/countries. Although observed trading patterns do often not support this hypothesis, there is a lack of research to explore the reasons why trade patterns often do not support the intuitive virtual water hypothesis. To fill this important gap, we introduce comparative advantage theory in a quantitative way to track the driving forces of net virtual water export based on the spatial-temporal distribution of resource productivity and opportunity costs of land, labor and water use in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors across Chinese provinces between 1995 and 2015. The results show that regional differences in land productivity between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors are the main forces determining the pattern of virtual water flows across major regions, and other resources such as labor and water have played only a limited role. Our study shows that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources, but does not reflect the water scarcity in the context of interregional trade in China. Our findings suggest that the ongoing efforts to increase land productivity of agriculture in the southern regions would contribute to reducing water scarcity in the North and Northeast China Plain.

AB Mycobacteria represent one of the most persistent bacterial populations in drinking water distribution system (DWDS) biofilm communities; however, mycobacterial in situ metabolic profiles are largely unknown. In this study, the metabolic characteristics of mycobacteria in a household water meter biofilm were unveiled using a coupled metagenomic/metatranscriptomic approach. The water meter biofilm appeared to express nitrogenase genes (nifDKH) and a full complement of genes coding for several carbon-fixation pathways, especially the Calvin cycle, suggesting the CO2 sequestration and dinitrogen fixation potential of the biofilm. These findings indicate that it may be difficult to prevent the formation of DWDS biofilms simply by controlling the availability of organic carbon or nitrogen. The composite genome of mycobacteria (CG-M) was reconstructed based on the obtained omics data. CG-M shared similar genome phylogeny and virulence-factor profiles with Mycobacterium avium complex, suggesting that population CG-M might represent a member of mycobacteria with pathogenicity. According to the gene expression patterns, population CG-M showed the metabolic potential to assimilate CO2 via the Calvin cycle and/or anaplerotic reactions, and even to grow autotrophically with CO as the sole carbon and energy source. This suggests that organic carbon may not be a limiting factor for mycobacterial growth in DWDSs. Moreover, our results suggest that mycobacterial aromatic degradation is primarily achieved through the catechol meta-cleavage pathway, and biofilm mycobacteria could prefer phosphate as the phosphorus source.

AB The aim of this study was to develop and test a non-diffusion limited, high cell density bioreactor for biodegradation of various phenol derivatives. The bioreactor was obtained using a straightforward one-step preparation method using cryostructuration and direct cross-linking of bacteria into a 3D structured (sponge-like) macroporous cryogel composite material consisting of 11.6% (by mass) cells and 1.2-1.7% polymer, with approximately 87% water (in the material pores). The macroporous cryogel composite material, composed of live bacteria, has pore sizes in the range of 20-150 mu m (confirmed by SEM and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy). The enzymatic activity of bacteria within the cryogel structure and the effect of freezing on the viability of the cross-linked cells was estimated by MIT assay. Cryogels based on Pseudomonas mendocina, Rhodococcus koreensis and Acinetobacter radioresistens were exploited for the effective bioremediation of phenol and m-cresol, and to a lesser extent 2-chlorophenol and 4-chlorophenol, utilising these phenolic contaminants in water as their only source of carbon. For evaluation of treatment scalability the bioreactors were prepared in plastic "Kaldnes" carriers to improve their mechanical properties and allow application in batch or fluidised bed water treatment modes.

AB Secondary disinfectants, such as chlorine and chloramine, have been widely applied to minimise microbial risks in drinking water during distribution. Key challenges have included the maintenance of stable concentrations of disinfectant residuals and the control of disinfection by-products that may form as a consequence of residual decay processes. Many factors may influence disinfectant residual stability and the consequential formation of by-products. Thus predictions of disinfectant stability and by-product formation are multifactorial problems, complete with numerous complications of parameter co-dependence and feedback amplification of some key parameters. The aim of this review was to derive an understanding of how disinfectant residual stability in drinking water distribution systems is impacted by various influencing factors such as water quality and operational parameters. Factors known to influence disinfectant stability and by-product formation were critically reviewed. A systematic review method was applied to identify 1809 journal articles published in the two decades from January 1998 to December 2017. From the initial screening, 161 papers were selected for detailed assessment Important factors were identified to include temperature, water age, piping material, corrosion products, pH, hydraulic condition, disinfectant residual type and dosage and microbial activity. Microbial activity is a particularly complex parameter on which to base predictions since many factors are known to influence the degree and nature of such activity. These include temperature, water age, piping material, corrosion products, nutrients, natural organic matter, hydraulic condition and disinfectant residual type and dosage. Disinfectant types and dosages were found to be among the most important factors. Many knowledge gaps and research needs still remain, including the need for a more complete understanding of the factors that influence the production of nitrogenous disinfection by-products.

AB The prevalence and seasonal variation of 7 viruses in 6 major rivers in Alberta were assessed using a combination of qPCR, cell culture and integrated cell culture with qPCR (ICC-qPCR). Water samples were collected monthly from rivers at different sites upstream and downstream of major urban centers. Seven viruses including rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, norovirus, sapovirus, JC virus and enterovirus, were detected in at least one of the water samples at each site using qPCR. Rotavirus was most common with concentration ranging from 23 to 4.5 log(10) genomic equivalent (GE) copies/L. Norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, adenoviruses and JC virus peaked during the winter (November to March). Viruses were most prevalent at the Bow River sampling site downstream of the City of Calgary, followed by the North Saskatchewan River site downstream of the City of Edmonton and the Red Deer River site downstream of the City of Red Deer. The detection rates and quantity of viruses had significant difference in the sampling sites between upstream and downstream of major urban centers (p < 0.001). 14% of the samples tested positive using viral culture indicating the presence of infectious viruses in river. Sequencing analysis identified human rotavirus in 75% of the samples collected from downstream versus 37% of the samples collected from upstream sites (p < 0.02). Multivariate binary regression showed that human activity in watersheds is a significant determinant of viruses in Alberta's Rivers. The discharge from wastewater treatment plants may be the possible sources of viral contamination. Seasonal coincidence of acute viral gastroenteritis outbreaks and monthly peak occurrence of enteric viruses in river water implies potential impact of waterborne viruses on human health.

AB The monitoring and control of drinking water quality is generally important as it significantly contributes to the health of the population. In this context, particular attention has to be paid to the use of treatment techniques during drinking water treatment. It is known that the formation of reaction products (transformation products) has to be taken into account when oxidizing agents such as ozone are used. Different transformation products are classified as critical to health and require analytical examination. The risk assessment for previously unknown transformation products can be difficult as far as not all transformation products are present as single substances or the individual substances are not present in a sufficient high concentration or cannot be isolated from the original solution. The aim of this work is to show exemplarily the identification and quantification of ozonation products (OPs) after ozonation and their toxicological characterization, using the artificial sweetener acesulfame. It was shown that OPs can be fully characterized using ion chromatography in combination with different detection systems. A major OP could be recovered as a pure substance by crystallization and direct genotoxicological testing was possible without previous enrichment processes. Acesulfame samples of different concentrations in ultrapure and in drinking water after ozonation were tested in several genotoxicity tests. These tests revealed genotoxic effects of acesulfame after ozonation in ultrapure water in several genotoxicological test systems (micronucleus test, umu test, Ames-fluctuation-test and comet assay). In contrast, the crystallized ozonation product OP168 did not show any positive effects. Therefore, it seems likely that the observed effect was caused by the second major product OP170. However, a sufficiently large amount of analytically pure substance OP170 could not be obtained. It was also shown that the rate of the OP170 formation in drinking water is significantly lower than in ultrapure water and that ozonation in drinking water did not induce genotoxic effects.

   Methods: In this research, the effects of PAICS on the occurrence and prognosis of LADC were evaluated using integrative bioinformatics analyses.
   Results: By employing the bioinformatics analyses of several public databases, PAICS, which is overexpressed in the LADC tissues, was identified as a potential tumor-promoting gene in LADC biology. Several relevant clinical studies indicated that the upregulation of PAICS was statistically correlated with a shorter overall survival time. Moreover, the carcinogenic function of PAICS in LADC was validated by the further protein-protein interactions (PPI) and biological process annotation analysis. Mechanistically, we found that the PAILS methylation level was significantly lower in the LADC tissues compared to the normal lung tissues. Furthermore, using the MEXPRESS web tool, we predicted 15 possible DNA methylation sites in the nucleotide sequences of PAICS, which could explain the alteration in the PAICS expression levels in LADC.
   Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that high levels of PAICS are found in LADC and that this gene may be a potential therapeutic target for this subset of lung cancers. Determining the detailed roles of PAICS in LADC biology may provide useful information for further investigations.

AB ARHGAP17 has long been thought to be involved in the maintenance of tight junction and epithelial barrier. Recently, a few Rho GTPase activating proteins (RhoGAPs) have been identified as tumor suppressors in some human cancers. The present study aimed to explore ARHGAP17 expression in cervical cancer and the possible function in tumor progression. ARHGAP17 expression in cervical cancer cell lines was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. ARHGAP17 expression in cervical cancer tissues and normal tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The cell proliferation was determined using CCK-8 in vitro and subcutaneous xenograft model in vivo. Here, we showed lower expression of ARHGAP17 in cell lines and human cervical cancer samples. Manipulation of ARHGAP17 affected cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of AKT was enhanced in ARHGAP17 silencing cervical cancer cells. ARHGAP17 can elevate P21 and P27 expression level through inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Stepwise investigations demonstrated that ARHGAP17 suppressed malignant phenotype of cervical cancer cells via inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These results reveal that ARHGAP17 functions as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer that suppresses tumor growth, at least partly, through inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling and up-regulation of P21 and P27 expression.

AB Common pregnancy detection methods in dairy cattle have limits in sensitivity and timing. Thus, we aimed at finding new early pregnancy biomarkers in milk. A previous study in milk cells and skim milk suggested the possible use of several miRNAs for this purpose. In order to make the sampling procedure more convenient for daily use and to include the milk fat into analysis, here, a similar study was repeated using whole fresh milk of days 4, 12, 18 and 21 of pregnancy and non-pregnant day-matched controls, respectively. The microRNAs (miRNAs) were extracted from milk samples and sequenced on a high throughput sequencer (RNAseq). Promising miRNAs were validated via RT-qPCR. Several miRNAs were significantly regulated and six miRNAs (bta-miR-221, bta-miR-223, bta-miR-93, bta-miR-200c, bta-miR-125b and the closely related bta-miR-15b) showed a continuous trend, similar as in the milk cells of the previous study. However, pregnant and cyclic animals could not be separated completely and RT-qPCR validation of the RNAseq data was unsuccessful. Thus, miRNA of bovine whole fresh milk samples failed to show suitability for early pregnancy diagnosis.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) as two prevalent age-related disorders in male have some shared genetic and immunological underlying mechanisms. However, researchers have aimed at identification of specific biomarkers with the ability to differentiate between these disorders. In the present study, we genotyped the rs4073, rs2227306 and rs1126647 single nucleotide polymorphisms within IL-8 gene in 530 individuals including 130 PCa patients, 200 BPH patients and 200 male controls. The rs2227306 alleles and genotypes were distributed equally in the three study groups. The frequency of the A allele of the rs4073 was significantly lower in PCa group compared with BPH group (OR (95% CI) = 0.62 (0.46-0.84), adjusted P value = 0.006). This allele was negatively associated with PCa risk in dominant model (OR (95% CI) = 0.53 (0.34-0.83), adjusted P value = 0.02). When comparing PCa and BPH groups, the rs1126647 was associated with PCa risk in recessive model (OR (95% CI) = 2.14 (1.23-3.72), adjusted P value = 0.02). The A T A haplotype (rs4073, rs2227306 and rs1126647 respectively) was less frequent in PCa group compared with BPH group (OR (95% CI) = 0.4 (0.22-0.75), adjusted P value = 0.03). Consequently, our data demonstrated significant differences in allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of IL-8 variants between BPH and PCa patients which might imply distinct role for this chemokine in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Future studies are needed to elaborate the underlying mechanism of these observations.

AB Members of the sucrose non-fermenting-1 -related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) family play central roles in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway and in mediating osmotic stress signaling and tolerance in plants. Previously, 12 full-length coding sequences that belong to SnRK2 gene family were identified and cloned in wild apple species Malus prunifolia. In this study, one of the members, MpSnRK2.10, was overexpressed in Arabidopsis and apple to investigate its potential function in response to drought stress. The results showed that over expression of this gene did not affect plant growth under normal conditions. However, the transgenic plants showed enhanced tolerance to drought, as indicated by the amelioration in phenotype appearance and physiological indices related to drought stress damage. Additionally, transgenic apple plants overexpressing MpSnRK2.10 exhibited greater sensitivity to ABA compared to wild-type (WT) plants. Moreover, expressions of three stress response genes, MdRAB18, MdRD22, and MdRD29B, were more strongly induced in transgenic apple plants than in the WT when subjected to ABA and mannitol treatments. Taken as a whole, our study suggests that MpSnRK2.10 has a role in the enhancement of ABA signal transduction in response to stress, and that the manipulation of MpSnRK2.10 expression could be a feasible approach for improving abiotic stress tolerance in apple and other important crops.

AB Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent cancer among children, and multidrug efflux mediated by overexpression of ABC transporters is the major impediment to successful chemotherapy in this malignancy. The goal of this study is to identify the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which may affect the expression levels of ABCA3; the previously identified prognostic biomarker for multidrug resistance (MDR) in childhood ALL (cALL). Bone marrow samples from 64 cALLs, including 46 de novo and 18 relapsed patients, in addition to 30 non-cancer controls were collected, and ncRNAs were nominated using in silico studies. Quantitative RT-PCR showed low expression profiles of miR-335-3p in cALLs compared with the control group (P = 0.018). Inverse correlation was determined between the miR-335-3p and ABCA3 mRNA expression profiles in cALL patients (r = 0.5019, P = 0.002). Moreover, it was shown that the expression levels of miR-335-3p was downregulated in the drug-resistant samples (MDR group) compared with the drug-sensitive patients (mrd - group), (P = 0.0005, AUC = 0.801). On the other hand, negative correlations were identified between the expression levels of miR-335-3p and the selected LncRNAs, NEAT1 and MALAT1, in the MDR group compared with the mrd - patients (P = 0.009), suggesting a sponge effect for these LncRNAs. The current study showed a potential regulatory role for miR-335-3p in ABCA3 expression targeted by NEAT1 and MALAT1 long non-coding RNAs. This negative impact may possibly contribute to the development of chemoresistance in childhood ALL, and provide an exceptional insight to new therapeutic approaches.

AB Intermediate filaments (IF) belong to major cytoskeletal components of metazoan cells. We have previously determined a tissue specific expression and assembly properties of all eleven cytoplasmic IFs (IFA-1 - IFA-4, IFB-1, IFB-2, IFC-1, IFC-2, IFD-1, IFD-2, IFP-1) in C. elegans and reported an essential function for four (IFA-1, IFA-2, IFA-3 and IFB-1) of them. In this study we continued the characterisation of the IF proteins in C. elegans by searching for in vivo polymerisation partners of the IFA proteins. Using the murine IFA-1 to IFA-3-specific monoclonal Ab MH4 and the immunoprecipitation assay as a tool, we identified the heteropolymeric IFA-1/IFB-1 complexes in the whole nematode protein extract, confirming their existence also in vivo. Moreover, in the present study we also analysed evolutionary aspects of the IF proteins in C. elegans and in nematodes. We found 106 C. elegans IF homologs in different nematode clades. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that all nematode IFs (including the three newly identified IF sequences IFA-5, IFCDP-1 and IFCDP-2) might arose from a AB-type IF ancestor through repeated gene duplications and sequence divergence. Interestingly, the C. elegans IF proteins IFA-1 and IFB-1 represent a heteropolymeric IF cytoskeleton in all investigated nematode clades, in contrast to other sequences restricted to the Glade III-V (IFA-2, IFA-4), III (IFA-5) and V (IFB-2, IFCDP) taxa, or even to the Caenorhabditis genus (IFA-3, IFC-1 to IFP-1). These analyses provide an insight into the origin of the multiple IFs in nematodes and also represent a basis for further studies of these sequences in nematodes.

AB Objective: Obesity is one of the major health problems strongly influenced by lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors. Previous studies have reported many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with obesity in different races. This study aimed to explore the genetic associations between LEPR, MC4R polymorphisms and overweight/obesity in Chinese Han adolescents.
   Methods: 400 adolescents including 222 health controls and 178 overweight/obese adolescents were genotyped and their body compositions were also analyzed in this study.
   Results: We found that allelic and genotypic frequencies of LEPR SNP rs8179183 were significantly different between controls and cases (allelic frequency p < 0.001; genotypic frequency p = 0.004). These difference was still significant (allelic frequency p < 0.011; genotypic frequency p = 0.024) after Bonferroni correction. Moreover, we found that rs8179183 was associated with serum triglyceride level after adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.037).
   Conclusion: In summary, our results found a significant association between LEPR SNP rs8179183 and overweight/obesity in Chinese Han adolescent. This study may provide a reference for future studies of obesity.

AB GLABROUS1 is an R2R3 MYB homolog that is essential for the initiation of trichome development. In this study, we used RACE to clone a full-length cDNA from Rosa roxburghii Tratt, termed RrGL1, which was 1013 bp, including an open reading frame of 792 bp that encoded 263 amino acids. In situ hybridization, corresponding with qRT-PCR results, revealed that RrGL1 transcripts were mainly expressed in petiole, leaf, and stem. RrGL1 expression levels at various fruit developmental stages in R. roxburghii were also evaluated. RrGL1 was highly expressed in young fruit, and the expression level decreased with fruit maturation. The overexpression of RrGL1 was able to functionally complemented the Arabidopsis thaliana gl1(-/-) mutant in trichome formation. RrGL1 was located in the cell nucleus with analysis of subcellular localization and physically interacted with A. thaliana GL3/EGL3 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, implying that RrGL1 might exert functions by forming a MYB-basic helix-loop-helix complex in trichome initiation. The formation of prickles in R. roxburghii is similar to that of Arabidopsis trichome.
   These results provided a foundation for further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and development of prickles that could assist and cultivate in the genetic engineering of prickle-free fruits.

AB High temperature is a common stress, which influences the growth and reproduction of plants. Maize is one of the most important crops all over the world. However, heat stress reduces significantly the yield and quality of maize. Therefore, it is important to illuminate molecular mechanism of maize response to heat stress. To estimate genes related to heat stress, we analyzed the transcriptome of maize in response to heat stress. In this study, six cDNA libraries were constructed form total RNA isolated from leaves of maize. A total of 35,209,446 and 35,205,472 clean reads were generated from CK (Control condition) and HTP (Heat stress condition) treatments, respectively. The results showed that 1857 DEGs were identified in maize after heat stress (1029 up-regulated and 828 down-regulated). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for DEGs indicated that protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathways play a central role in maize response to heat stress. In addition, in the present study, 167 putative TFs were identified, which belong to various TF families (e.g., MYB, AP2-EREBP, b-ZIP, bHLH, NAC and WRKY), and may be associated with heat stress response of maize. This research may contribute to understand the molecular mechanism of maize inbred line B73 response to heat stress, which is beneficial for developing maize cultivars to improve yield and quality.

AB Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can be widely used in stem cell therapy. However, few studies have revealed the potential mechanisms of the changes in aging MSC.
   Materials and methods: In this study, microarray data GSE35955 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Then limma package in R was used to filtrate differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Transcription factors (TFs) were predicted by DCGL package. After predicting TFs, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and TF-mediated transcriptional regulation network were constructed. The functional and pathway enrichment analysis of screened DEGs, hub genes and TFs were conducted by the DAVID.
   Results: Totally 156 up-regulated DEGs and 343 down-regulated DEGs were obtained. 6 hub genes (CTNNB1, PPP2R1A, FYN, MAPK1, PIK3C2A and EP300) were obtained from PPI network. 11 TFs (CREB1, CUX1, EGR1, EP300, FOXC1, HSF2, MEF2A, PLAU, SP1, STAT1 and USF1) for DEGs were predicted and 2 highly scored co-expression relationships (EP300-PPP2R1A and STAT1-FOXC1) were acquired from the TF-mediated transcriptional regulation network.
   Conclusions: The discovery of the hub genes, TFs and pathways might contribute to the understanding of genetic and molecular functions of aging-related changes in MSC. Further validation studies on genes and TFs such as CTNNB1, FYN, PPP2R1A, MAPK1, EP300 and related biological processes and pathways, including adherens junction, DNA damage caused from oxidative stress, attribution of telomere, MSC differentiation and epigenetic regulation, are urgent for clinical prevention and treatment.

AB Proline-arginine-rich (PR)-39 is neutrophil antimicrobial peptide that has potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and some enveloped viruses as a part of the innate immune system. We analyzed the nucleotide sequence variations of PR-39 exon 4, which is the mature peptide region responsible for antimicrobial activity, from 48 pigs of six breeds using sequence-based typing. The analysis identified four alleles including allele PR-35 with a 12-bp deletion near the N-terminus. Interestingly, 16.7% of individuals showed the presence of three alleles per individual, but only in the Berkshire and Duroc breeds. We further analyzed the genetic diversity of PR-39 for the entire genomic region of the gene from PR-39 exon 1 to the 3' untranslated region for different alleles by PCR amplification and cloning. The antimicrobial activity of chemically synthesized PR-35 was similar to that of PR-39, but the level of mammalian cell cytotoxicity was lower than the wild type. Better knowledge of the genetic diversity of PR-39 among different individuals and breeds may contribute to improved immune defense of pigs. PR-35, as a natural antimicrobial peptide variant, could be an interesting candidate for the development of peptide antibiotics.

AB A short term starvation and refeeding experiment was conducted to study the temporal changes in SOD, CAT and HSP70 gene expression of Labeo rohita fingerlings. The study was carried out for 15 days with initial 7 days of starvation and then refeeding up to 15th day of the experimental trial. The expressions of SOD and CAT genes of liver and gills were significantly up-regulated after 7 days of starvation, down-regulated after 3 days of refeeding, and returned to the basal values after 8 days of refeeding. The HSP70 gene expression was significantly (p < 0.05) increased after starvation, with highest mRNA expression found on 7th day and reduced to the levels of control on refeeding. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, SOD and CAT were also studied to correlate with the results of gene expression. The changes in activities of SOD and CAT were found significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the starved group compared to the fed group. The dynamics of AST and ALT in serum revealed a progressive increase till the 7th day and decreased upon refeeding, cortisol level also has shown significant increase up to 7th day of starvation and sharp decline on refeeding. The concentration of blood glucose level start declining on 3rd day onwards with lowest level found on 7th day of starvation and was quickly restored to the levels of control on refeeding. The present study reveals that starvation elicits oxidative stress response as revealed by enhanced expression and activities of antioxidant enzymes, HSP 70 and serum biochemical alterations. However, these alterations were restored upon refeeding of L. rohita within 7 days.

AB Background and objective: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory system affecting primarily distal respiratory pathways and lung parenchyma. This work was designed as a case-control study aimed at investigating the association of the NRF2/KEAP1 signaling system, and antioxidant defense gene polymorphisms with COPD in population from Russia.
   Methods: Ten SNPs: NFE2L2 (rs35652124), KEAP1 (rs1048290), MPO (rs2333227), PRNP (rs1799990), PTGR1 (rs2273788), HSPA1A (rs1008438), TXNRD2 (rs1139793), GSR (rs1002149), SIRT2 (rs10410544), and PTGS1 (rs1330344) were genotyped by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan assays) in a case-control study (425 COPD patients and 457 controls, from the same region of Russia, representatives of Tatar population). Logistic regression was used to detect the association of SNPs in different models. Linear regression analyses were performed to estimate the relationship between SNPs and lung function parameters and smoking pack years.
   The results: In our population, a significant associations of KEAP1 (rs1048290) (P = 0.0015, OR = 0.72 in additive model), HSPA1A (rs1008438) (P = 0.006, OR = 2.26 in recessive model), GSR (rs1002149) (P = 0.037, OR = 1.31 in additive model) with COPD were revealed. NFE2L2 (rs35652124), PRNP (rs1799990), and HSPAIA (rs1008438) were significantly associated with COPD only in smokers. In nonsmokers, significant association was established for GSR (rs1002149). KEAP1 (rs1048290) was associated with COPD in both groups.
   The relationship between KEAP1 (rs1048290), NFE2L2 (rs35652124), and HSPA1A (rs1008438) and smoking pack-years was found (P = 0.005, P = 0.0028, P = 0.015). A significant genotype-dependent variation of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s was observed for SIRT2 (rs10410544) (P = 0.04), NFE2L2 (rs35652124) (P = 0.028), and PRNP (rs1799990) (P = 0.044).

AB The transcription factor v-maf avain musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (MAF) plays an important role in lens development. It contains a unique extended homology region (EHR) in the DNA binding domain. MAF mutations are associated with phenotypically distinct forms of congenital cataract and show different effects on the transactivation of target genes. Mutations in the MAF EHR region were rarely reported and their corresponding phenotype and impact on target genes' transactivation were not evaluated. A three generation Chinese family with congenital cataract was recruited. The patients in the family present non-syndromic congenital nuclear and lamellar opacities. A novel MAF mutation (c.812 T > A, p.Val271Glu) was identified by targeted next-generation sequencing. The mutation is in highly conserved EHR region of MAF and co-segregates with the cataract in the family. It is predicted to be pathogenic by multiple algorithms and is absent in a control population. Dual luciferase activity assay shows the mutation significantly impair the transcriptional activity of four crystallin genes (CRYAA, CRYBA4, CRYBA1, and CRYGA) and two non-crystallin genes (HMOX1 and KDELR2). Herein, we report a novel missense mutation in the MAF EHR region of the DNA binding domain in a family with congenital cataract. The mutation is associated with non-syndromic bilateral nuclear cataract and impacts the transactivation of cataract associated genes involved in lens structure and stress response.

AB Background: The current study aimed to identify potential diagnostic and prognostic gene biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.
   Methods: Microarray data of gene expression profiles of CRC from GEO and RNA-sequencing dataset of CRC from TCGA were downloaded. After screening overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by R software, functional enrichment analyses of the DEGs were performed using the DAVID database. Then, the STRING database and Cytoscape were used to construct a protein protein interaction (PPI) network and identify hub genes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted to assess the diagnostic values of the hub genes. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to screen the potential prognostic genes. Kaplan-Meier curve and the time-dependent ROC curve were used to assess the prognostic values of the potential prognostic genes for CRC patients.
   Results: Integrated analysis of GEO and TCGA databases revealed 207 common DEGs in CRC. A PPI network consisted of 70 nodes and 170 edges were constructed and top 10 hub genes were identified. The area under curve (AUC) of the ROC curves of the hub genes were 0.900, 0.927, 0.869, 0.863, 0.980, 0.682, 0.903, 0.790, 0.995, and 0.989 for CCL19, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL11, CXCL12, GNG4, INSL5, NMU, PYY, and SST, respectively. A prognostic gene signature consisted of 9 genes including SLC4A4, NFE2L3, GLDN, PCOLCE2, TIMP1, CCL28, SCGB2A1, AXIN2, and MMP1 was constructed with a good performance in predicting overall survivals of CRC patients. The AUC of the time-dependent ROC curve was 0.741 for 5-year survival.
   Conclusion: The results in this study might provide some directive significance for further exploring the potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis prediction of CRC patients.

AB Ion uptake mechanisms are diverse in fish species, certainly linked to duplication events that have led to the presence of a multitude of paralogous genes. In fish, Na+ uptake involves several ion transporters expressed in different ionocyte subtypes. In the European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax, several key transporters potentially involved in Na+ uptake have been investigated in seawater (SW) and following a 2 weeks freshwater (FW) acclimation. Using gel electrophoresis, we have shown that the Na+/H+-exchanger 3 (nhe3, slc9a3) is expressed in gills and kidney at both salinities. Quantitative realtime PCR analysis showed a significantly higher nhe3 expression in fresh water (FW) compared to SW. Its apical localization in a subset of gill ionocytes in freshwater-acclimated fish supports the role of NHE3 in Na+ uptake. Interestingly, NHE3-immunopositive cells also express basolateral Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) and are mainly localized in gill lamella. Among the three nhe2 (slc9a2) paralogs, only nhe2c shows differential branchial expression levels with higher mRNA levels in SW than in FW. The increased branchial expression of the ammonia transporter rhcg1 (Rhesus protein), nhe3 and cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase (cac) in FW could indicate the presence of a functional coupling between ion transporters to form a Na+/NH4(+) exchange complex. Acid-sensing ion channel 4 (asic4) seems not to be expressed in sea bass gills. Na+/Cl- cotransporter (ncc2a or ncc-like) is about three times more expressed in FW compared to SW suggesting coupled Na+ and Cl- uptake in a subset of gill ionocytes. Besides the main pump Na+/K+-ATPase, branchial NCC2a and NHE3 may be key players in ion uptake in sea bass following a long-term freshwater challenge.

AB Introduction: microRNAs (miRNAs) play important role in the regulation of placental development, and abnormal miRNA expression is associated with preeclampsia (PE). miRNAs are released from trophoblast cells to maternal blood flow, where they are highly stable, being encapsulated inside extracellular vesicles, like exosomes or bound to Argonaute proteins. In PE, placental dysfunction leads to aberrant extracellular miRNA secretion. hsa-miR-210 is a hypoxia-sensitive miRNA found to be upregulated in PE; however, it is unknown whether it is the cause or the consequence of the disease.
   Objective: Our aim was to analyze the expression of several miRNAs, including hsa-miR-210 in placenta, exosome and Ago-bound fractions comparing normal (N) and PE pregnancies. We performed in vitro analyses of extracellular hsa-miR-210 secretion of trophoblast cell cultures (of villous and extravillous origin) under hypoxic condition.
   Methods: PE and N placenta samples were collected from C-sections, and blood samples were drawn from each pregnant woman in the third trimester. HTR-8 and JAR cell lines were cultured in exosome-free media and treated with hypoxia-mimetic agents. Exosome and Ago-bound fractions were isolated by membrane affinity spin column method from plasma and cell media. Short RNAs were extracted from exosomes and vesicle-free fractions, and total-RNA was isolated from the placenta samples. The RNA purity and concentration were measured by spectrophotometry. Expression analysis was carried out by qPCR with specific primers to target and reference miRNAs.
   Results: The level of hsa-miR-210 was significantly higher in PE placentas, which could cause a minor increase of exosomal and a high elevation of Ago-bound miR-210 in circulation. Hypoxia lead to intracellular hsa-miR-210 upregulation in trophoblast cell lines. In extravillous cell (HTR-8) media, only the level of exosomal hsa-miR-210 was increased but no change in Ago-bound hsa-miR-210 level was observed. In contrast, in villous cell (JAR) media, the level of exosomal hsa-miR-210 was increased and enhanced release of Ago-bound hsa-miR-210 was also observed.
   Conclusion: Based on our data, we postulate that in PE, exosomal hsa-miR-210 is secreted actively from the trophoblast, and by intercellular communication, it may have a role in disease etiology. In addition, there is a passive release of Ago-bound hsa-miR-210 into the circulation, which may represent by-products of cell-death and is thereby a possible consequence of the disease.

AB The quest to elucidate the molecular mechanism of action of rapamycin in the early 1990s led to the discovery of the novel TOR (target of rapamycin) proteins in yeast and mammalian cells. This was a major breakthrough that resulted in the development of new rapamycin analogs as anti-cancer agents, and launched new research that revealed the pre-eminent biological role of mTOR (mammalian or mechanistic TOR). Beyond mediating rapamycin sensitivity, the TOR proteins are nutrient sensing protein kinases, conserved from yeast to man, with a core function in regulating cell growth, metabolism and overall cell survival. There have been many insightful historical accounts of the origins of TOR; however, the complete TOR dossier would benefit from a chapter on the untold story of the simultaneous co-discovery of the yeast TOR proteins by two independent laboratories, one that is inclusive of the discoveries made at the former SmithKline Beecham (legacy GlaxoSmithKline). Accordingly, this comprehensive retrospective retraces the provenance of yeast TOR (circa 1990-1996) and highlights the early groundbreaking publications that revealed the identity of the TOR genes and proteins. It also commemorates key companion papers which helped to clarify yeast TOR gene nomenclature, identified structural motifs in the predicted TOR protein sequences, demonstrated interactions between yeast FKBP12-rapamycin and TOR, characterized mutations responsible for drug resistance, and began to decipher TOR protein function; some of these crucial early studies appeared in this journal (e.g., Koser et al., 1993. Gene 129, 159-165; Cafferkey et al., 1994. Gene 141, 133-136; Freeman and Livi, 1996. Gene 172, 143-147). A period of intensive investigation, events are portrayed chronologically and juxtaposed alongside the independent parallel efforts to identify and purify mTOR. Finally, in a broader historical context, TOR and mTOR are examined a posteriori as paragons of multiple discovery, illustrating how this common phenomenon (also known as simultaneous invention) can greatly accelerate problem solving and advance human knowledge in a fast-breaking area of scientific research.

AB A number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genetic determinants of plasma lipids in European populations, in which analytical approaches have often been based on the linear regression models and the association test between a SNP and each lipid component individually in cross-sectional designs. Since lipid variations are correlated, the consideration of pleiotropy is necessary and using methods that can perform simultaneous association test of multiple longitudinal traits provides more information about the recognition of the pleiotropic variants. To identify new pleiotropic variants and to determine whether loci identified in previous GWASs can also exert the same effect on lipid concentrations in Iranian population, longitudinal measurements of lipid variations were used in a sample of Iranian population (16,353 individuals within 3100 families) that followed up every 3 years and using a two-step model, the associations of 20,036 available SNPs on chromosome 16 were assessed. Twenty variants within the AC009035.1, SLC12A3, CETP, NLRC5, ESRP2 and, C16orf95 genes showed strong evidence for association with HDL-C, cholesterol, and triglycerides with p-values ranging from 1.7 x 10(-102) to 6.6 x 10(-5). Since many genetic variants associated with lipids still remain to be determined, the results of the present study may provide valuable information on identifying the associations of new genetic loci with lipid variations in other populations.

AB In living organisms, the MicroRNAs act as an important role by controlling regulatory mechanisms, and likely manipulating the output of numerous protein-coding genes. Several computational databases, algorithms and tools have been developed to discover the miRNA target genes. But, the existing methods obtain poorer results in identification of miRNA target gene. Hence in this research work, integrated prediction scores is used to identify the microRNA target interactions and hybrid fuzzy algorithms are used to make final predictions. The proposed algorithms such as Fuzzy, Fuzzy + Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Fuzzy + SVM + Random Forest (RF) are used to conduct prediction by majority voting and it is compared with the existing techniques such as SVM, RF and Neural Network (NN) to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, the ranking features are estimated using the Arabidopsis thaliana microRNA sequence. From the experimental results, it is inferred that the proposed Fuzzy + SVM + RF algorithm performs superior than the existing ones.

AB Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious complication in patients with advanced liver disease. The pathological pulmonary angiogenesis contributes to the progression of HPS. Importantly, directional collective migration of endothelial cells is a critical event for pathological angiogenesis. Previously, we have demonstrated that the over-expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was an important factor in the experimental HPS. However, the role of COX-2 in the directional collective migration of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) is unclear. Our study aims to evaluate the potential effect of COX-2 in the directional collective migration of HPMVECs under the stimulation of HPS patient serum. In this study, 9 patients with stable liver cirrhosis were screened for presence of HPS. We confirmed that HPS patient serum dramatically promoted the directional collective migration and angiogenesis of HPMVECs, while the COX-2 selective antagonist parecoxib significantly inhibited the directional collective migration of HPMVEC under the stimulation of HPS patient serum. In addition, HPS patient serum significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of PKC and promoted the activation of Rac via COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway. Notably, silencing PKC activation attenuated the directional collective migration of HPMVEC induced by HPS patient serum. In conclusion, these results indicate that PKC/Rac signaling induced by COX-2 modulates collective directional migration of HPMVEC during pathological pulmonary angiogenesis in HPS patients.

AB Exercise intensity is known to affect neuroplasticity. Although corticosterone and lactate levels have been linked to neuroplasticity, the effect of different endurance exercise intensity-dependent production of these biochemicals on the behaviour of hippocampal growth cone markers remains incompletely explored. Here, we investigated the effects of three different endurance treadmill training episodes for six weeks on GAP-43 and CAP-1 expression in the hippocampus of adult male Wistar rats. Our findings showed that mild exercise intensity (MEI) with a lactate production slightly higher than the lactate threshold (LT) is the optimal form of physical activity for elevating GAP-43 without changing CAP-1 expression. It was further observed that high exercise intensity (HEI) with the highest level of corticosterone and lactate production, reduced GAP-43 expression, yet increased CAP-1 expression in the hippocampus. Like HEI, we further identified similar expression patterns for these markers in low exercise intensity (LEI) with blood lactate production below LT and corticosterone level similar to MEI. The findings suggested that in high-intensity exercise, the negative pattern of hippocampal neuroplasticity depends on both corticosterone and lactate levels, whereas in low-intensity exercise, the most important factor determining this negative pattern is the lactate level. Generally, MEI with a lactate production of slightly higher than LT is the most optimal intensity for improving hippocampal neuroplasticity.

AB Mitochondrial genome organization of sea anemones appears conserved among species and families, and is represented by a single circular DNA molecule of 17 to 21 kb. The mitochondrial gene content corresponds to the same 13 protein components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system as in vertebrates. Hallmarks, however, include a highly reduced tRNA gene repertoire and the presence of autocatalytic group I introns. Here we demonstrate that the mitochondrial genome of the deep-water sea anemone Protanthea simplex deviates significantly from that of other known sea anemones. The P. simplex mitochondrial genome contains a heavily scrambled order of genes that are coded on both DNA strands and organized along two circular mito-chromosomes, MCh-I and MCh-II. We found MCh-I to be representative of the prototypic sea anemone mitochondrial genome, encoding 12 OxPhos proteins, two ribosomal RNAs, two transfer RNAs, and a group I intron. In contrast, MCh-II was found to be a laterally transferred plasmid-like DNA carrying the conserved cytochrome oxidase II gene and a second allele of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene.

AB The expression of Azgp1 gene, an adipokine involved in the mobilization of body reserves, was observed in mammary gland of ruminants. Its regulation by different dietary conditions suggests a potential role in the mechanisms controlling the composition of milk fat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of Azgp1 during lactation. Azgp1(-/-) mice were compared to wild-type to determine its effects on milk fatty acid composition and offspring growth. To determine its effects on mammary gland, adipose tissue and liver gene expression, gene expression was analyzed using RT-qPCR via TLDA analyses. The body weight of Azgp1(-/-) mothers was slightly higher after parturition and at 10 days of lactation compared to the wild type. The milk polyunsaturated fatty acid content was increased in Azgp1(-/-) mice. Among the 40 genes studied, Azgp1(-/-) modified the expression of 9, 10 and 3 genes in mammary gland, adipose tissue and liver, respectively. These genes, involved in fatty acid synthesis, transport and triglyceride synthesis, were downregulated in Azgo1(-/-) mice showing a particularity during lactation. Changes in mammary gland gene expression may explain the modifications observed in milk fatty acid composition. This study supports a role of Azgp1 on lipid metabolism, in particular in mammary gland, during lactation function.

AB It is widely known that transcriptional diversity contributes greatly to biological regulation in eukaryotes. With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, several studies on RNA sequencing have considerably improved our understanding of transcriptome complexity. However, obtaining full-length (FL) transcripts remains a considerable challenge because of difficulties in short read-based assembly. In the present study, single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing and NGS were combined to generate the complete and FL transcriptome of Manis javanica. The results provide a comprehensive set of reference transcripts and hence contribute to the improved annotation of the M. javanica genome. We obtained 45,530 high-confidence transcripts from 19,109 genic loci, of which 8014 genes have not yet been annotated within the M. javanica genome. Furthermore, we revealed 8824 long-chain noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). A total of 30,199 alternative splicing (AS) and 11,184 alternative polyadenylation (APA) events were identified in the sequencing data. The structure and expression level of 59 digestive enzyme genes, including 13 carbohydrase genes, 28 lipase genes and 18 protease genes, were analyzed, which might provide original data for further research on M. javanica.

AB The anticancer activity of Zingiber officinalis (ginger) is an area of active research. However, data is quite limited regarding its action and mechanism, especially in hematologic cancer types. Here, antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of whole extract of the rhizome of Zingiber officinalis (ZOWE), was investigated in K562 cell line derived from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient. Various concentrations of whole extract (0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mu M) were tested in K562 cultures. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis was assessed with appropriate methods, as well as cellular ROS levels. In this study, we showed that ZOWE inhibited proliferation of K562 cells substantially, when compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy donor. Increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased PARP cleavage demonstrated that ZOWE inhibited proliferation by induction of apoptosis. These changes were coupled with an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, ZOWE addition to the culture also reduced expression levels of survival proteins pAkt and survivin, in a concentration dependent manner. Our results clearly mark that ZOWE causes to a reduction in cell viability, an induction of apoptosis and elevation in ROS levels in chronic myeloid leukemia cells and effects are significantly different from healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells, further supporting its potential therapeutic value.

AB Long non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs) have been reported to play pivotal roles in various cancers. Recently, MIR31HG was proposed to be involved in tumor progression. However, its role in non small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) remains elusive. In this work, we found that SP1-induced MIR31HG was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, Cox multivariate survival analysis revealed that high MIR31HG was an independent predictor of poor overall survival(OS). Functionally, knockdown of TINCR obviously suppressed NSCLC cells migration and invasion in vitro and inhibited NSCLC cells metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified MIR31HG could act as a miR-214 sponge using RNA pull down, luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Lastly, we verified that over expression of MIR31HG effectively reverses miR-214-induced inhibition of NSCLC cells progression. Therefore, MIR31HG might serve as a promising prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for NSCLC patients.

AB Simulations involving free surfaces and fluid interfaces are important in many areas of engineering. There is, however, still a need for improved simulation methods. Recently, a new efficient geometric VOF method called isoAdvector for general polyhedral meshes was published. We investigate the interface reconstruction step of isoAdvector, and demonstrate that especially for unstructured meshes the applied isosurface based approach can lead to noisy interface orientations. We then introduce a novel computational interface reconstruction scheme based on calculation of a reconstructed distance function (RDF). By iterating over the RDF calculation and interface reconstruction, we obtain second order convergence of both the interface normal and position within cells even with a strict L-infinity error norm. In 2D this is verified with reconstruction of a circle on Cartesian meshes and on unstructured triangular and polygonal prism meshes. In 3D the second order convergence is verified with reconstruction of a sphere on Cartesian meshes and on unstructured tetrahedral and polyhedral meshes. The new scheme is combined with the interface advection step of the isoAdvector algorithm. Significantly reduced absolute advection errors are obtained, and for CFL number 0.2 and below we demonstrate second order convergence on all the mentioned mesh types in 2D and 3D. The implementation of the proposed interface reconstruction schemes is straightforward and the computational cost is significantly reduced compared to contemporary methods. The schemes are implemented as an extension to the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Open Source software package, OpenFOAM (R). The extension module and all test cases presented in this paper are released as open source. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We focus on the numerical approximation of the Cahn-Hilliard type equations, and present a family of second-order unconditionally energy-stable schemes. By reformulating the equation into an equivalent system employing a scalar auxiliary variable, we approximate the system at the time step (n + theta) (n denoting the time step index and theta is a real-valued parameter), and devise a family of corresponding approximations that are second-order accurate and unconditionally energy stable. This family of approximations contains the often-used Crank-Nicolson scheme and the second-order backward differentiation formula as particular cases. We further develop two efficient solution algorithms for the resultant discrete system of equations to overcome the difficulty caused by the unknown scalar auxiliary variable. Within each time step, our method requires only the solution of either four de-coupled individual Helmholtz type equations, or two separate individual systems with each system consisting of two coupled Helmholtz type equations. All the resultant linear algebraic systems involve only constant and time-independent coefficient matrices that can be pre-computed. A number of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the family of schemes developed herein. We note that this family of second-order approximations can be readily applied to devise energy-stable schemes for other types of gradient flows when combined with the auxiliary variable approaches.

AB In this study we generate optimal Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes for converging the Artificial Compressibility Method (ACM) using dual time-stepping with high-order unstructured spatial discretizations. We present optimal RK schemes with between s = 2 and s = 7 stages for Spectral Difference (SD) and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations obtained using the Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach with solution polynomial degrees of k = 1 to k = 8. These schemes are optimal in the context of linear advection with predicted speedup factors in excess of 1.80x relative to a classical RK(4,4 )scheme. Speedup factors of between 1.89x and 2.11 x are then observed for incompressible Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) of turbulent flow over an SD7003 airfoil. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the schemes for incompressible ILES of a turbulent jet, achieving good agreement with experimental data. The results demonstrate that the optimized RK schemes are suitable for simulating turbulent flows and can achieve significant speedup factors when converging the ACM using dual time-stepping with high-order unstructured spatial discretizations.

AB We develop a robust and efficient iterative method for hyper-elastodynamics based on a novel continuum formulation recently developed in [1]. The numerical scheme is constructed based on the variational multiscale formulation and the generalized-alpha method. Within the nonlinear solution procedure, a block factorization is performed for the consistent tangent matrix to decouple the kinematics from the balance laws. Within the linear solution procedure, another block factorization is performed to decouple the mass balance equation from the linear momentum balance equations. A nested block preconditioning technique is proposed to combine the Schur complement reduction approach with the fully coupled approach. This preconditioning technique, together with the Krylov subspace method, constitutes a novel iterative method for solving hyper-elastodynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed preconditioning technique by comparing with the SIMPLE preconditioner and the one-level domain decomposition preconditioner. Two representative examples are studied: the compression of an isotropic hyperelastic cube and the tensile test of a fully-incompressible anisotropic hyperelastic arterial wall model. The robustness with respect to material properties and the parallel performance of the preconditioner are examined. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We consider fast deterministic algorithms to identify the "best" linearly independent terms in multivariate mixtures and use them to compute, up to a user-selected accuracy, an equivalent representation with fewer terms. Importantly, the multivariate mixtures do not have to be a separated representation of a function. One algorithm employs a pivoted Cholesky decomposition of the Gram matrix constructed from the terms of the mixture to select what we call skeleton terms and the other uses orthogonalization for the same purpose. Both algorithms require O(r(2)N + p(d) rN) operations, where N is the initial number of terms in the multivariate mixture, r is the number of selected linearly independent terms, and p(d) is the cost of computing the inner product between two terms of a mixture in d variables. For general Gaussian mixtures p(d) similar to d(3) since we need to diagonalize a d x d matrix, whereas for separated representations p (d) similar to d (there is no need for diagonalization). Due to conditioning issues, the resulting accuracy is limited to about one half of the available significant digits for both algorithms. We also describe an alternative algorithm that is capable of achieving higher accuracy but is only applicable in low dimensions or to multivariate mixtures in separated form.
   We describe a number of initial applications of these algorithms to solve partial differential and integral equations and to address several problems in data science. For data science applications in high dimensions, we consider the kernel density estimation (KDE) approach for constructing a probability density function (PDF) of a cloud of points, a far-field kernel summation method and the construction of equivalent sources for non-oscillatory kernels (used in both, computational physics and data science) and, finally, show how to use the new algorithm to produce seeds for subdividing a cloud of points into groups.

AB Data-driven methods for improving turbulence modeling in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations have gained significant interest in the computational fluid dynamics community. Modern machine learning algorithms have opened up a new area of black-box turbulence models allowing for the tuning of RANS simulations to increase their predictive accuracy. While several data-driven turbulence models have been reported, the quantification of the uncertainties introduced has mostly been neglected. Uncertainty quantification for such data-driven models is essential since their predictive capability rapidly declines as they are tested for flow physics that deviate from that in the training data. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven framework that not only improves RANS predictions but also provides probabilistic bounds for fluid quantities such as velocity and pressure. The uncertainties capture both model form uncertainty as well as epistemic uncertainty induced by the limited training data. An invariant Bayesian deep neural network is used to predict the anisotropic tensor component of the Reynolds stress. This model is trained using Stein variational gradient decent algorithm. The computed uncertainty on the Reynolds stress is propagated to the quantities of interest by vanilla Monte Carlo simulation. Results are presented for two test cases that differ geometrically from the training flows at several different Reynolds numbers. The prediction enhancement of the data-driven model is discussed as well as the associated probabilistic bounds for flow properties of interest. Ultimately this framework allows for a quantitative measurement of model confidence and uncertainty quantification for flows in which no high-fidelity observations or prior knowledge is available.

AB Turbulence modelling development has received a boost in recent years through assimilation of machine learning methods and increasing availability of high-fidelity datasets. This paper presents an approach that develops turbulence models for flows exhibiting organised unsteadiness. The novel framework consists of three parts. First, using triple decomposition, the high-fidelity data is split into organised motion and stochastic turbulence. A data-driven approach is then used to develop a closure only for the stochastic part of turbulence. Finally, unsteady calculations are conducted, which resolve the organised structures and model the unresolved turbulence using the developed bespoke turbulence closure. A case study of a wake with vortex shedding behind a normal flat plate, at a Reynolds number of 2,000, based on plate height and freestream velocity, is considered to demonstrate the method. The approach shows significant improvement in mean velocity and Reynold stress profiles compared with standard turbulence models. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce a methodology for nonlinear inverse problems using a variational Bayesian approach where the unknown quantity is a spatial field. A structured Bayesian Gaussian process latent variable model is used both to construct a low-dimensional generative model of the sample-based stochastic prior as well as a surrogate for the forward evaluation. Its Bayesian formulation captures epistemic uncertainty introduced by the limited number of input and output examples, automatically selects an appropriate dimensionality for the learned latent representation of the data, and rigorously propagates the uncertainty of the data-driven dimensionality reduction of the stochastic space through the forward model surrogate. The structured Gaussian process model explicitly leverages spatial information for an informative generative prior to improve sample efficiency while achieving computational tractability through Kronecker product decompositions of the relevant kernel matrices. Importantly, the Bayesian inversion is carried out by solving a variational optimization problem, replacing traditional computationally-expensive Monte Carlo sampling. The methodology is demonstrated on an elliptic PDE and is shown to return well-calibrated posteriors and is tractable with latent spaces with over 100 dimensions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB A particle based algorithm for fluid surface detection and evaluation of the interface force due to surface tension for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is presented in this work. The algorithm identifies the surface particles by examining the local geometry around them, and it presents sharp interface transition region. The curvature and normal for the identified surface particles are extracted from the geometry around the surface particles. The interface force is integrated into the SPH equation for fluid dynamics with full consideration of interface effects. The algorithm presented is capable of detecting arbitrary surface undergoing fragmentation and coalescence. The stability and accuracy of the interface force simulated with this algorithm are validated with test cases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the influence of microstructural parameters, the presence of hydroxyapatite (HA) and cell culture conditions on growth of bone cells on poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds. The scaffolds with 85% porosity and pore size: 250-320 mu m and 400-600 mu m were modified with hydroxyapatite (HA). MG-63 osteoblast-like cells were cultured in static and dynamic conditions on these scaffolds up to day 14. HA deposits increased wettability of the modified scaffolds. Cell adhesion and proliferation in static conditions were comparable for all scaffold types till day 14. In dynamic condition, the highest cell growth was on 400-600HA, which was comparable to that in static culture. Significantly lower cell growth was on 250-320 and 400-600 non-modified scaffolds. For 250-320HA cell number was significantly higher than on 250-320, but lower than on 400-600HA. Thus, deposition of HA on PLGA scaffolds with higher size of pores, i.e. 400-600HA, enhanced cell growth in dynamic conditions. On all scaffolds cells produced osteogenic markers osteopontin and osteocalcin. The most abundant osteopontin level was on 400-600HA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chiral building units must pack into chiral crystal structures. However, chiral structures can also be induced from achiral building units. In this letter, the later well-known phenomenon is illustrated with the simple synthesis of a new chiral compound from commonly used achiral organic molecules. Thus, the new compound cyclohexylammonium sulfanilate was synthesized at room temperature and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, spectroscopy (UV/Visible and FT-IR), and thermal analysis. The compound is chiral and crystallizes in orthorhombic system with space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). Noncentrosymmetry was confirmed by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) measurements using solid potassium dihydrogenphosphate (KDP) as reference. The organic ions which form this chiral compound namely cyclohexylammonium (CyNH3+) and sulfanilate (NH2PhSO3) are both low-cost achiral building units. A statistical investigation of previously reported structures shows that NH2PhSO3 stabilized by noncentrosymmetric cations more likely lead to noncentrosymmetric materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB An electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the deposition of LiFePO4-carbon black films for application in Li-ion batteries. The approach is based on the use of poly[1-[4-(3-car boxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzenesulfonamido]-1,2-ethanediyl, sodium salt] (PAZO-Na) and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na), as dispersing, charging and film forming agents. The individual monomers of PAZO-Na and CMC-Na created multiple bonds with metal atoms on the particle surface and allowed for efficient electrosteric dispersion and charging of relatively large commercial LiFePO4 particles. The microstructure, deposition mechanism and electrochemical performance were investigated. The LiFePO4 electrode, prepared by the EPD method, exhibited a capacity of 146.7 mA h g(-1) at C/10 and enhanced cycling stability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Axiolitic zinc oxide/reduced graphene oxide (ZnO/r-GO) hybrid was achieved by a facile one-step hydrothermal route in this work. The axiolitic ZnO rods with uniform size were equally implanted in r-GO nanosheets. The composites exhibit prominent microwave absorption performance with the Min. RL of -55.7 dB for a thickness of merely 2.0 mm and effective absorption bandwidth covering the whole Ku band, which benefits by the introducing of axiolitic ZnO rods and constructing distinct structures. The synergistic effect of dipole polarization, interface polarization and conductivity manifestly boost the microwave attenuation capacity. The results indicated that the axiolitic ZnO/r-GO hybrid is a promising candidate for application in the field of microwave absorption, electromagnetic interference shielding, communication and safety information, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB It has been noticed that residual osteosarcoma cells or infective bacteria would greatly hinder the osseointegration between implants and natural bone at the early stage of implant surgeries. Thus, in this work, composite coatings of magnesium-mediated metal-organic frameworks (Mg-MOF74) and strontium-substituted hydroxyapatite (Sr-HA) were constructed on titanium surfaces for improving the local injury treatment even with complications (osteosarcoma or bacterial infection). It was proved that the superficial Mg-MOF74 could rapidly degrade (especially under bacteria- or osteosarcoma-induced acid microenvironment) and effectively kill surrounding Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Saos-2 cells, and then the exposed Sr-HA coating had great potential to promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts.

Chemical and structural properties of Porous Alumina Whiskers (PAW) were evaluated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) which confirm the successful synthesis of PEGylated PAW. Moreover, biocompatibility was accessed via MIT-assay using Rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. Finally drug loading and release capabilities of PEGylated PAW were tested using photosense, a standard photodynamic therapy (PD) model drug. Results confirm the suitability of PAW as a potential platform for drug delivery. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular dynamic simulation has been conducted to investigate the irradiation effects on mechanical properties of monocrystalline and nanocrystalline W samples. It is found that irradiation has quite different effects on mechanical properties of monocrystalline and nanocrystalline W, i.e., the ideal tensile strength of monocrystalline and nanocrystalline W decreases and increases with the increase of irradiation energy, respectively. In addition, nanocrystalline W with smaller nanoparticles possesses higher tensile strength under irradiation, which is fundamentally due to more grain boundaries absorbed with more interstitial atoms. The derived results could provide a deep understanding of irradiation effects on monocrystalline and nanocrystalline W. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel flower-like g-C3N4/MoS2  heterojunction with high supercapacitor performance has been successfully synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal process. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared g-C3N4/MoS2 heterojunction are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, which indicate the optimal g-C3N4/MoS2 exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 532.7 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 Ag(-1 )and excellent cycling stability with 88.6% of capacitance retention at 1 A g(-1) after 1000 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the combination of g-C3N4 and flower-like MoS2, which provides excellent charge transfer field and electrolyte diffusion channels while effectively prevents the corruption and aggregation during charging and discharging process. More importantly, our work provides a fresh insight into designing high-performance electrode heterojunction and extending the actual application of g-C3N4/MoS2. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A permanent orbital implant is highly required to support ocular tissues after surgical removal of patient's eye during an ocular disease treatment. We therefore study the feasibility to use egg shell waste for producing biomedical porous glass-ceramic orbital implants. A biocompatible porous glass-ceramic implants were prepared from egg shell-based calcium-silicate glasses by foam replication method. The egg shell-derived glass-ceramic implants obtained a pure biocompatible CaSiO3 phase at 1100 degrees C. In comparison to the glass-ceramic implants from a commercial CaCO3, the egg shell-derived glass-ceramic implants contained an open-macropore network with porosity over 30% allowing the fibrovascular tissue ingrowth. The glass-ceramic implants derived from egg shells had good chemical stability in simulated body fluids (2-weeks in vitro test). Therefore, this new porous glass-ceramic material is a promising alternative low-cost biomedical implant for ocular prosthesis applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Investigations of the wear resistance of nanocrystalline NiTi sheets with different grain sizes of 10 nm, 42 nm, and 80 nm were carried out by nanowear tests under different normal forces of 100 mu N, 300 mu N and 500 mu N. Surface topographies from 1 to 100 passes were measured during the nanowear tests. Experimental results show that the minimization of grain size remarkably improves the nanohardness of alloy since the martensitic phase transformation is restrained, and affects the competition between the hardness and the martensitic phase transformation, consequently makes direct influence upon the wear resistance. The nanohardness is a dominant factor of nanocrystalline NiTi sheets against wear until the martensitic phase transformation gains an advantage under a heavy load condition. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pd-0 cluster-modified porous FeVO4 nanorods were synthesized by a hydrothermal-chemical reduction route. The Pd-0-modified porous FeVO4 nanorods exhibit an enhanced selective gas sensing property for benzyl alcohol detection at 160 degrees C in comparison with the pure FeVO4. Moreover, Pd-0-modified porous FeVO4 nanorods show a lower detection limit and higher reliability than the pure FeVO4. The significant enhancement in gas sensing property of Pd-0-modified porous FeVO4 nanorods is attributed to the formed porous structure and efficient electron-hole separation resulted from the deposition of Pd-0 nanoclusters.

AB This paper presents a novel and simple non-covalent method to synthesize a double-cladding coaxial structured hybrid by depositing Pt nanoparticles on hemin-coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The Pt nanoparticles cooperated with hemin can be used for methanol electro-oxidation and oxygen reduction. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the Pt nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the hemin-coated MWCNTs with a small particle size and a narrow particle size distribution. Cyclic voltammetry tests revealed that the as-prepared Pt/hemin-coated MWCNT electrocatalysts exhibited higher electrochemical surface area (67.46 m(2)/g) and current density (425.0 mA mg(-1)) for methanol oxidation than Pt/MWCNTs. These improvements can be attributed to the dual role of hemin in the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on functionalized MWCNTs and the synergy of catalysis in methanol electro-oxidation and oxygen reduction. It's the first time to report the functionalization of CNTs with catalytic hemin as the binder between CNTs and the metal nanoparticles of MOR or ORR catalyst. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Dielectric measurements in combination with diffraction contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to confirm the phase diagram of BSPT system. From these results, the low temperature phase diagram for BSPT was achieved. In present study, high piezoelectric properties with piezoelectric coefficients (d(33) approximate to 545 pC/N, d(3)(3)* approximate to 920 pm/V) and planar electromechanical coupling factor (k(p) approximate to 57%) are achieved in the ceramics at the composition x = 0.64, indicating a future high-temperature piezoelectric application.

AB VBO3 nanoparticles on graphene sheets (VBO3@G) composite is synthesized by a freeze-drying method as anode material for lithium-ion batteries. After optimization of sintering temperature, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) forms a 3D-framework and VBO3 nanoparticles are adhered to the surface of rGO uniformly. The graphene sheets not only assist the formation of nanoparticles, but also provide an excellent conductive 3D network. It is found that the composite shows a good cycling performance with an initial charge capacity of 779 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintains 610 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. It also exhibits an excellent rate performance with charge capacities of 592 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and 442 mAh g(-1) at 10 C. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We designed and fabricated novel PbBiO2Br nanosheets via Polyacrylamide gel method. XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and UV-vis absorption spectra were used to investigate the crystal microstructure, morphology, band-gap and optical properties of the as-prepared PbBiO2Br nanosheets. The photocatalytic performance and stability of PbBiO2Br nanosheets were evaluated by removing methylene blue (MB) aqueous solution (20 mg/L) under visible-light irradiation. Results showed that the PbBiO2Br was brick-like nanosheets with an average side size of about 80 nm and the absorption edge at about 500 nm, and exhibited an excellent photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the repeated cycle experimental results demonstrated that the PbBiO2Br nanosheets had a good chemical stability. Finally, the possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed and discussed.

The microstructure investigated by optical microscopy and macrotexture analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Results showed the microstructure was refined by FSBE process. For the 475 rpm rotational speed, the grain size decreased to its minimum value i.e. 15.5 mu m. The overall texture intensity of FSBE processed wires significantly decreased compared to the starting material. Moreover, the texture was dependent on the rotational speed. The higher rotational speed led to lower texture intensity near to a random texture. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB After synthesized with a solvothermal process, LiFePO4 nanoparticles have been further modified with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and Ag nanoparticles via a facile heat treatment route. The as-prepared LiFePO4@rGO/Ag exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in storing Li ions with more than 60% increase in discharge specific capacity compared with pristine LiFePO4 at C/10. The discharge specific capacity of the as-prepared cathode materials reaches to 130 mAhg(-1) at high rate of 5 C, which is about 4 times higher than that of pristine LiFePO4. The highly enhanced electrochemical properties of the cathode materials can be attributed to the synergetic effect of rGO nanosheets and Ag nanoparticles, which can build up conductive networks to form 3D nanocomposites together with LiFePO4.

AB Calcination temperature plays a critical role on morphology and structure of CeO2 nanofibers, thus affecting its photocatalytic activity. CeO2 nanofibers with diameter of 95 nm were successfully fabricated by electrospinning combining with calcination. The calcination temperature was determined by TGA results ranging from 500 degrees C to 800 degrees C. The morphology and structure of samples obtained with different calcination temperatures, have been characterized by SEM and XRD. Meanwhile, the specific surface area of samples were checked by BET, that was decreased 17 times from 56.3 m(2)/g to 3.3 m(2)/g, as the temperature increasing from 500 degrees C to 800 degrees C. Normally, the higher specific surface area, the more efficiency photocatalytic activity. But it was interesting that the photodegradation rate of methylene blue was increased from 67% to 98% for CeO2 catalyst obtained at 500 degrees C and 800 degrees C, with 4 times higher kinetic constant reaction rate under UV irradiation for 60 min. It demonstrates that the photocatalytic activity of CeO2 nanofibers catalyst is not directly related to the specific surface area, and increasing the calcination temperature has a positive effect for the photocatalytic efficiency.

The desired CMTs/CNTs could not only possess high electric conductivity for efficient charge transport but could also increase surface area for accessing more electrolyte ions. When assembled into an EDL capacitor using an ionic liquid electrolyte, it exhibits the maximum energy density of 70.9 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 583.0 W kg(-1) and remains 28.6 Wh kg(-1) at a higher power density of 8.57 kW kg(-1).

AB Zr2Co11 thin films were deposited by sputtering. MgO thin film was deposited on the top of Zr2Co11, followed by FeCo thin film deposition and post-annealing, to have magnetic exchange coupling between Zr2Co11 and FeCo. MgO thin film worked as a diffusion barrier between Zr2Co11 and FeCo during post-annealing. The thickness of FeCo layer was controlled as 4, 8 and 12 nm, respectively. The results showed that when the FeCo thickness was 8 nm, the Zr2Co11/MgO/FeCo showed the optimum magnetic properties, with 58% increased of (BH)(max) over Zr2Co11, which could be attributed to the effective exchange coupling between Zr2Co11 and FeCo. The exchange coupling between Zr2Co11 and FeCo thin film was investigated by Henkel plots. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Results show that Sn-contained Mg-4Zn alloys have lower hydrogen release and better antibacterial property to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) than that of Mg-4Zn alloy, for Sn incorporated in the surface film. Zn2+ and Sn2+/Sn4+ ions degraded from the alloys are the main cause for the high antibacterial effect.

AB In this study, nano-aluminum (nAl)/1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX)/nitrocellulose (NC) nested core-shell microspheres were fabricated by the coaxial-electrospray technique. The investigations on morphology properties and chemical heterogeneity demonstrate that RDX is integrated with nAl particles coated by NC utilizing the nested core-shell structure. The structure contributed to the improvement of combustion heat and laser ignition sensitivity of electrosprayed nAl/RDX/NC microspheres. Characteristic thermal behaviors were also produced due to the multi-layer structure. Analysis of the flame radiative intensity suggests that ignition properties of the microspheres could be attributed to the synergetic interface, which enhances thermal and mass transmission between each component and then reduces ignition delay.

AB To apply magnesium in biodegradable bone fixation devices, it is favorable to improve its properties through approaches such as by forming composites between magnesium and calcium phosphate. In this study, a powder metallurgical method was used to prepare composites of a magnesium-calcium alloy and alpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP). Refinement of the alpha-TCP particle size caused more uniform distribution and microstructure. Consequently, the composite with finer alpha-TCP particle size had better ductility to the alloy lacking alpha-TCP. The biodegradation properties were improved by the addition of alpha-TCP, and the refinement of the alpha-TCP particles led to a slower degradation rate in electrochemical and immersion tests.

AB The hydrogen absorption properties and diffusion behavior in V-3A alloys (V, V97Al3, V97Ru3) were studied by pressure-composition-temperature measurements and first-principles calculations. It was found that addition of Al and Ru could increase first plateau pressure. With the largest surface area among these alloy powders, V-3Ru achieved the highest hydrogen diffusivity at 433 K under an initial pressure of 1500 Pa. Hydrogen diffusion behaviors were examined by DFT calculations of barriers in both surface and internal cases of V-3A alloys. It revealed that initial diffusion rate was related to surface morphology. The results are expected to provide useful guidelines for understanding hydrogen absorption and diffusion properties of hydrogen storage materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel method was proposed to refine the grain structure and enhance the strength of extruded AZ91 alloys by electric pulse. The grain structure was refined to the average size of 2.25 mu m due to the strong athermal effects. The size of Mg(17)Al(12)phase was greatly reduced and its distribution became much more dispersive. The strong {0 0 0 1} basal texture with c-axis parallel with normal direction appeared, and its intensity was slightly increased. The specimen extruded by electric pulse with the peak current density of 117.4 A/mm(2) exhibited the highest yield strength of 221 MPa and tensile strength of 384 MPa. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES
AB The brittle Sn58Bi solder was modified with the ductile copper foam (Cu-F) with high plasticity to improve its mechanical properties. It is observed that the coarse microstructure of Sn58Bi solder is notably refined by the uniform distribution of copper foam. Moreover, it is found that the shear force of Sn58Bi soldered sample increases sharply with increasing shear distance and brittle fracture occurs once the shear force reaches the maximum value. However, thanks to the existence of large amount of copper frameworks in Sn58Bi + Cu-F soldered sample, significant plastic deformation is generated after reaching the maximum shear force and no fracture is observed. Also, the Sn58Bi + Cu-F soldered sample demonstrates a higher resistance to elastoplastic deformation as the average maximum indentation depth decreases from 2.48 mu m to 1.80 mu m compared to the Sn58Bi solder. In addition, the creep of soldered samples becomes stable after 200 s, and a lower creep rate is gained in Sn58Bi + Cu-F soldered sample. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We describe the beta -> alpha phase transformation in SiC/SiC fiber-reinforced composites prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) and hot-pressing, resulting in samples of >96% relative density and uniform beta-SiC microstructure for the SPS composites. Starting from beta-SiC powders, the phase transformation from beta to alpha in the samples manufactured by SPS is shown to be suppressed due to the influence of lower sintering temperature, shorter processing time, and higher pressure. These samples are compared to ones produced by a hot-pressing (HP) technique that results in samples with very significant conversion to alpha-SiC. This study is of special interest for the production of SiC/SiC composite structures for electronic, structural, and nuclear applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TGA-DTA analysis shows improvement in thermal stability of HDPE with the addition of TiO2. The dielectric constant (kappa) of HDPE and HDPE-10TiO(2) slightly increased with increasing frequency and it decreased for other HDPE composites. On the other hand, the dielectric loss of HDPE samples significantly lowered and is stable with increasing frequency. More importantly, the dielectric constant of HDPE increased from 5.31 to 20.02 (at 1 kappa HZ) with TiO2 filler, and is the highest ever achieved for HDPE materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bimetallic nickel molybdenum disulfide (NiMoS2) thin films were fabricated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates using pulsed laser deposition and employed as counter electrode in solar energy conversion devices. Krypton fluoride (KrF) excimer laser was used as source for fabricating NiMoS2 thin films. The energetic active sites of the NiMoS2 were tuned under in-situ temperature conditions (room temperature and 600 degrees C). The quantitative and qualitative analyses of the fabricated materials were examined using various characterization techniques. Active modes of Raman vibrations in correspondence with NiMoS2 are observed from Raman spectra and the presence of 2H pristine (MoS2) and hexagonal (Ni) phase are determined from XRD analysis. The surface morphology of fabricated NiMoS2 thin films was dynamically visualized from FESEM analysis. The JV characteristic performance of the pulsed laser deposited NiMoS2 counter electrode analyzed using solar simulator at illumination of 100 mW/cm(2) . NiMoS2 employed DSSCs exhibits a photo-conversion efficiency of similar to 4.80%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chitosan and vitamin B2 sodium phosphate were used as assembly agents to prepare the flame retardant, antibacterial, and colored silk fabric by an electrostatic layer by layer assembly padding technique. The effects of assembly bilayer number on the flammability and thermal degradation of silk fabric as well as the morphological structure of the unburned and burned silk fabrics were studied, and the antibacterial activity of the treated fabric was evaluated. At 5 and 10 assembly bilayers, the treated fabrics had a limiting oxygen index of 28.9% and 32.8%, respectively, and their residual char length in the vertical burning test was shorter than 15 cm, revealing their good flame retardancy. The treated fabric exhibited great antibacterial ability as indicated by the inhibition rate against both S. aureus and E. coli of higher than 90%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we report an efficient and scalable mechanochemical method for the synthesis of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskites. XRD confirms the tetragonal phase of synthesized powders with (1 1 0) as high intensity at 2 theta = 14.2 degrees which is in accordance with the reported values. The vibrational mode of methylammonium (CH3-NH3+ - rocking) is located in the IR frequency region between 900 and 910 cm(-1). The chemical states determined by XPS analysis indicate the presence of Pb in divalent state in addition to C, N and I. The TGA/DSC analysis demonstrates the high thermal stability (350-390 degrees C) of mechanochemically synthesized perovskites as compared to solvent-mediated synthesis. In addition, XRD analysis of perovskite annealed at 100-400 degrees C also described the thermal stability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemical-deposition method was engaged to prepare Fluorine doped Tin oxide (FTO) modified Polydiphenylamine (PDPA)/Phosphotungstic acid (PTA)/Manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanohybrid (FTO/PDPA/PTA/MnO2-ME) Electrode. Nanocomposites structural analysis, morphology, and molecular vibrational studies were characterized through X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infra read Spectroscopy (FTIR). Recorded XRD and FTIR pattern authenticates the existence of PDPA, PTA, and MnO2 structures. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies performed using electrochemical workstation shows very high specific capacitance value of 514.77 Fg (1) at 5 mVs (1) for the modified hybrid electrode system. The superior capacitive performance, cyclic stability of FTO/PDPA/PTA/MnO2 electrode was attributed due to the existence and fast reversible multi-electron redox response of tungsten atoms in PTA along with PDPA-MnO2 synergistic interaction that augments the electron transfer processes.

ID PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
AB In this study, Ti-Sb-Te (TST) alloy doped with Cu has been proposed to enhance the phase change and electrical properties of TST. The formation of Cu-Te bond was suggest to be responsible for the improved thermal stability of the Cu-0.28(Ti0.09Sb0.38Te0.53)(0.72) (Cu0.28TST) film. Cu0.28TST-based phase change memory cell can be triggered by a 5 ns electric pulse. Such fast speed was ascribed to its growth-dominated crystallization mechanism and the precipitation of Sb in the crystallization process. Furthermore, an endurance cycles up to 10(5) could be achieved in the memory cell. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel organic single crystal guanidinium 4-hydroxybenzoate (GuB) was synthesized and grown successfully using slow evaporation solution growth technique. It is a non-centrosymmetric crystal and crystallized in monoclinic crystal system. The structure refinement of the grown crystal was done using single crystal X-ray diffraction study. The optical property of the title compound was established using UV-vis-NIR transmittance spectrum and energy gap was calculated through Tauc's plot. The thermal stability of the grown crystal was ascertained using thermo gravimetric - Differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA). The emission property of the title compound was analyzed through photoluminescence analysis. The Commission International d'Eclairage (CIE) color chromaticity coordinates explored its dominant colour emission property. Piezoelectric behaviour of the GuB crystal was confirmed through piezoelectric charge coefficient. The second order nonlinear behaviour of the grown crystal was revealed using Kurtz-Perry powder technique. The above results reveal the efficiency of the title compound for frequency doubling and transducer applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical metal nanostructures (HMNS) have attracted great interests for applications in electronics, catalysis, and sensors. Here, we report a novel method to prepare hierarchical metal nanorods arrays by combining superplastic nanomolding with dealloying. The fabricated sample possesses size as large as centimeters and with uniform hierarchical metal nanorods chemically attached in its surface, which guarantees the structural stability of the HMNS. This is distinct with other techniques, where assembling nanostructures on the macroscale with good uniformity and maintaining good mechanical stability has general challenging. We further show that the microstructures in HMNS can be tuned through independent ways, which provides the possibility to study microstructure-property relationship. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB FeMnSiCrNi alloys present good properties, although the oxidation resistance at high temperatures is limited by high manganese amount. Thus, the present study evaluated a vacuum annealing treatment on an Fe-17Mn-5Si-10Cr-4Ni-VC alloy as a surface modification method, aiming to improve oxidation resistance. The treatment was performed during 10 hat 1100 degrees C, generating an external ferrite layer of 170 mu m in thickness (manganese decreased to 2 wt%). Oxidation tests at 800 degrees C up to 24 h in untreated and vacuum treatment demonstrated that heat treatment decreased the mass gain rate in two orders of magnitude through more protective oxide formation.

AB Herein we present our research on a novel three phase antibacterial wound dressing prepared from carbon nanotubes, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers. The AgNPs were generated on carbon nanotubes surfaces to synthesize carbon nanotubes-AgNP nanoparticles which were added into the polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers prior to electrospinning to prepare PVA/carbon nanotubes-AgNP composite nanofibers. All characterizations confirmed the three phase nanofiber architecture. Owing to growth of AgNPs on carbon nanotubes surfaces and embedding into PVA nanofibers the wound dressings are proposed for sustained and safer wound healing applications. The antibacterial test results confirmed excellent bactericidal and prolonged bacterial growth inhibition properties of the nanocomposites which suggest their suitability as sustained antibacterial wound dressing biomaterial.

ID IMPLANTATION
AB 100 keV N-14(+) ion beam (at fluences of 10(16) and 10(17) ions/cm(2)) irradiation was used to alter the sp(2) bonded carbon networks (as revealed by Raman scattering analysis) and incorporate N atoms into the surface and sub-surface regions (as revealed by Rutherford backscattering analysis) in the typical polycrystalline diamond films and as a consequence, the electrical conductivity of the diamond thin films was enhanced several orders in comparison to the as-deposited film. The enhancement in electrical conductivity was achieved with negligible morphological and structural changes in the diamond thin film. This work demonstrates an easy and effective way of altering the electrical conductivity of diamond thin films to a required sub-surface depth. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As an eco-friendly adsorption material, hydroxyapatite (HA) exhibits different adsorption characteristics depending on its morphology. In the present work, nano HA with different morphologies was successfully synthesized by controlling the addition of mono-dodecyl phosphate potassium (MDP-K). The particle size, specific surface area and pore volume of the as-prepared HA powders are inclined to be on the rise with the increase of MDP-K addition. The bitter gourd-shaped nano HA, synthesized with addition of 4 g MDP-K, possesses with a specific surface area of 77.25 m(2)/g, a pore volume of 0.1825 cm(3)/g as well as a high adsorption capacity of heavy metal ions. The outstanding adsorption property for heavy metal ions of nano HA provides evidence that the material has a great potential in application of water treatment procedure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Numerical simulation is used as a comprehensive tool for analysis and optimization of the multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) growth by the Directional Solidification (DS) method. We have used a transient global heat transfer model to optimize the temperature profile of the DS process to produce high-quality multi-crystalline silicon ingots for solar cell application. The melt-crystal interface shape, impurities and von Mises stress were studied by the numerical simulation with different temperature profiles. A slightly convex interface shape, lower thermal stress and lower impurities in the me-Si were obtained due to the lower temperature gradient by the optimized temperature profile. Simulation results show that the optimized temperature profile is particularly suitable for high quality me-Si ingot. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PACLITAXEL; NANOPARTICLES; FILOMICELLES; RELEASE
AB Polymeric micelles have been widely studied and developed for targeted delivery of cytostatic drugs. However, due to heterogeneity of tumor cells, targeting efficiency may be enhanced by using different types of targeting agents on the same drug delivery system. The aim of the study was to obtain and characterize paclitaxel-loaded biodegradable poly(L-lactide)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA-PEG) micelles functionalized with folic acid and biotin. The developed dual targeted micelles show low critical micelle concentration, high loading capacity of paclitaxel and prolonged in vitro drug release. The cytotoxicity of paclitaxel-loaded micelles was confirmed against folate- and biotin-receptor positive OVCAR3 cells, which indicates their usefulness for targeted delivery of cytostatic drug.

   adsorption; Pseudo-second order
AB In this work, a Prussian blue (PB)/graphene oxide (GO)/chitosan (CS) organic-inorganic composite was successfully synthesized and utilized as an adsorbent for the selective removal of cesium (Cs+) ions. Taking the advantage of synergistic effect GO, CS and PB nanoparticles, the PB/GO/CS composite exhibited maximum adsorption capacity of 48.35 mg g(-1) for Cs+ ions. In the presence of competitive monovalent cations (K+ and Na+), PB/GO/CS showed excellent selectivity (86%) for Cs+ ions and had a 6-fold higher distribution coefficient (K-d) than GO/CS. This enhanced adsorption capacity with high selectivity of PB/ GO/CS for Cs+ ions may have been attributed to (i) the presence of carboxylic, hydroxyl and amino functional groups on GO/CS matrix which strongly bind Cs+ ions through electrostatic attraction and chelation, and (ii) the trapping of Cs+ ions by the voids of the FCC-structured PB lattice whose size is equivalent to the hydration radius of Cs+ ions. Due to its low-cost, facile preparation, high adsorption capacity, and superior Cs+ ions selectivity, PB/GO/CS is a promising material for the selective removal of the Cs+ ions from the environment and for protecting ecosystems from the radiation hazards.

Transmission electron microscopy imaging revealed that the size of escin stabilized AuNPs falls within the range of 5-20 nm and their surface plasmon resonance maximum was observed at 530 nm. Escin-AuNPs was found to improve insulin-dependent glucose uptake in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells, which was further confirmed by estimating the stored glycogen content. Escin-AuNPs exhibited excellent free radical scavenging activity. Thus, escin-AuNPs may be considered as promising molecule to test against diabetic complications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The CuO-doped KNLNT ceramics prepared by normal sintering at temperatures greater than 900 degrees C resulted in inhomogeneous microstructures with a bimodal grain size distribution. In contrast, two-step sintering (920-930 degrees C for 0 h in the first step and 880 degrees C for 1-12 h in the second step) resulted in a homogeneous microstructure with a grain size of a few micro-meters. The samples prepared by two-step sintering had superior piezoelectric properties and piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) figure of merit comparable to samples prepared by normal sintering. Multi-layered PEH with CuO-doped KNLNT ceramic layers with homogeneous microstructures were successfully fabricated by a two-step sintering method and their harvesting characteristics were measured.

AB Surface functionalization of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with antimorphine produced a new turn-on fluorescent nanosensor for morphine detection. The antimorphine-GQDs were prepared through the covalent conjugation of GQDs with antimorphine. FT-IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS) confirmed the conjugation of antimorphine to GQDs. Fluorescence intensity of the antimorphine-GQDs enhanced after addition of morphine allowing its sensitive determination with detection limit of 0.06 mu M. Further experiments revealed that this nanosensor has no interaction with other narcotics such as methamphetamine and codeine. Thus, it can act as inexpensive and selective nanosensor for specification of low concentrations of morphine. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phase stability of gamma' precipitates in single crystal Ni-based superalloys at the elevated temperature is inherently associated with creep performance. During high temperature in-service exposure, the coarsening of gamma' precipitates typically occurs and further results in coalescing that is regarded as an indicator of degradation of creep resistance. In this research, we design three single crystal Ni-based superalloys by means of solely tuning Mo:W ratio to investigate their coarsening behaviors upon different temperatures (950-1050 degrees C) and exposure times (0-500 h). The experimental results showed that the coarsening rate of gamma' precipitates increases with increasing Mo:W ratio. The coarsening kinetics are adequately characterised by the classical LSEM model. The experimental results can be used to optimize the design of alloy chemistry. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mechanical metamaterials are an extraordinary class of materials that harness their unusual characteristics from the geometrical features. Herein, we report a design strategy to decipher anisotropic and aperiodic nonwovens as auxetic metamaterials by carefully decorating with the slit perforations in a stochastic manner. These slit perforated nonwoven materials have been tested under uniaxial tensile deformation by altering the aspect ratio of the specimen dimensions. Ostensibly, the slit perforations in nonwovens created the invariant behavior towards the test direction and the aspect ratio of the specimen dimensions. These slit perforations have led to the geometrical frustration-free structures that are of paramount importance to avoid any hindrance to the desired functionality. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In concentrating photovoltaic (CPV), increasing the incoming sunlight to the solar cell influences the performance of the solar cells. The optical efficiency of the CPV components is a key factor to improve the electrical efficiency. Two types of homogeniser materials (K9 glass and crystal resin) were investigated in the CPV application. The results show a higher power generation of the CPV module when using K9 glass homogeniser compared to the crystal resin homogeniser by 27% due to the high transmittance value of the K9 glass material. In addition, the K9 glass material shows an excellent resistance to the heat produced by the concentrated sunlight compared to the crystal resin material. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile, inexpensive solution approach was utilized to prepare novel 3D porous Cu2O-MoS2 microspheres, which were employed for NH3 gas detection. Morphological characterizations indicated porous MoS2 microspheres were decorated with numerous Cu2O nanoparticles. The fabricated gas sensor based on the Cu2O-MoS2 microspheres possessed high gas response of 43 with fast response and recovery speed towards NH3, good reproducibility as well as satisfactory stability, which were mainly ascribed to the distinctive 3D porous microsphere architecture and the formation of p-n heterojunction at the interface between the n-type MoS2 and p-type Cu2O.

AB Al-Mg alloy thin wall components were fabricated with wire + arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) by feeding ER5356 wires and adding titanium powder. The microstructure and mechanical properties were analyzed, and the results showed that the phase Al3Ti formed provides heterogeneous nucleation cores, which contributed to the refinement of interlayer grains, transition of the crystal type from columnar to equiaxed, and increase of the fraction of low angle grain boundaries. Comparing thin wall components with and without titanium powder, the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of those with titanium increased in the vertical and horizontal direction. The micro-hardness of the interlayer was enhanced by 5-10 HV. With the addition of titanium powder, the mechanical properties of the WAAM Al-Mg alloy exhibited more isotropic characteristics in both directions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present work investigated the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) initiation behavior of Alloy 600 during the transition of hydrogenated/oxygenated water condition at evaluated temperature. Slow strain rate test (SSRT) was applied and the test was divided into the pre-immersion period and load period. Hydrogenated/oxygenated water transition was implemented to realize the in-situ hydrogen charging. Pre-immersion in hydrogenated water chemistry can enhance SCC initiation happening in the following oxygenated water chemistry in terms of a higher crack density. The phenomena were attributed to the enhanced effect of the pre-charged hydrogen in metal on oxidation process and the consequent formation of less protective oxide film when the oxygenated condition is applied and the implications of the phenomena in the nuclear power plant were also given.

AB A multifunctional photocatalyst was prepared by porphyrin sensitized core-shell nanocomposite Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2 (FST) to degrade organic contaminants more effectively. Nanocomposite Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2 (FST) modified by maleic anhydride (MA) to improve dispersion property, and as a bridge molecule to graft with 5,10,15,20-meso-tetra-(para-amino)-phenyl-porphyrin (TAPP) to obtain FST-g-TAPP, and characterized by XRD, SEM, FT-IR, BET, TGA. The results demonstrated the successful grafting of TAPP onto the FST surface and grafting content of TAPP was about 3.2%. The photocatalytic activity of FST-g-TAPP was evaluated by degrading rhodamine B (RhB) in the presence of H2O2 under visible light irradiation. After 3 h, the degradation efficiency of 5 mg FST-g-TAPP (94.66%) was significantly higher than that of FST-MA (78.28%) and pure FST (52.72%). In addition, the photostability test of FST-gTAPP demonstrated that it is reusable and stable due to strong covalent bonds between TAPP and FST. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A copper phosphide (Cu3P) thin film is synthesized on a Ni foam using a one-step electrodeposition method at room temperature and annealed at 300 degrees C in Ar atmosphere. The Cu3P film is amorphous and has a flat morphology with surface voids. It works as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation in an alkaline 1 M KOH electrolyte. It exhibits excellent catalytic oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 310 mV, Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec, and good stability over 20 h of operation at 10 mA/cm(2).

AB Optimization problems widely exist in many expert and intelligent systems, e.g., greenhouse intelligent control systems in agriculture, energy management systems for hybrid electric vehicle, and job shop scheduling systems in manufacture. For the optimization problems in these systems, the objective functions may change over time. This kind of problem is usually called as dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) or optimizing in dynamic environments. The optimization algorithm plays an important role in designing an expert and intelligent system. In this paper, we present a novel particle swarm optimizer for optimization in dynamic environments. We introduce two schemes to improve performance of particle swarm optimization in dynamic environments. Firstly, the classical particle swarm optimization is enhanced by a collaborative mechanism, in which a target particle learns from another randomly selected particle and the global best one in the swarm. Instead of moving to the new position directly, a worst replacement operator is used to update the swarm, whereby the worst particle in the swarm moves to the better newly generated position. During optimizing, the best solution in each generation is stored. When an environmental change is detected, the historical solutions are retrieved to collaborate with some newly generated solutions to adapt to the new environment. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with several reported algorithms over the benchmark problems. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm offers superior performance compared with the competitors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying human face shape is the first and the most vital process prior to choosing the right hairstyle to wear on according to guidelines from hairstyle experts, especially for women. This work presents a novel framework for a hairstyle recommender system that is based on face shape classifier. This framework enables an automatic hairstyle recommendation with a single face image. This has a direct impact on beauty industry service providers. It can simulate how the user looks like when she is wearing the chosen hairstyle recommended by the expert system. The model used in this framework is based on Support Vector Machine. The framework is evaluated on hand-crafted, deep-learned (VGG-face) features and VGG-face fine-tuned version for the face shape classification task. In addition to evaluating these individual features by a well-designed framework, we attempted to fuse these three descriptors together in order to improve the performance of the classification task. Two combination techniques were employed, namely: Vector Concatenation and Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) techniques. All the hyper-parameters of the model were optimised by using Particle Swarm Optimisation. The results show that combining hand-crafted and VGG-face descriptors with MKL yielded the best results at 70.3% of accuracy which was statistically significantly better than using individual features. Thus, combining multiple representations of the data with MKL can improve the overall performance of the expert system. In addition, this proves that hand-crafted descriptor can be complementary to deep-learned descriptor. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anterior forearm recognition systems emerged in last decades to identify the vein systems and to decide the venipuncture sites. Basically, identification and also real-time visualization of the forearm veins are commonly accomplished by near-infrared (NIR) camera systems in the literature and also in applied medicine; however what we propose in this paper is easier and reliable alternative by thermal imaging. While identifying vein systems, the common drawback of visible spectrum and NIR camera solutions is lack of recognition possibility of rather hidden veins in the forearms. In other words, while these solutions are so useful for identification of superficial veins like Median Cubital and Median Antebrachial veins; yet they are not so efficient for subcutaneous veins like Cephalic vein. Therefore, we introduce a novel fuzzy directional curvature methodology to recognize the whole vein system of anterior forearm using infrared thermal (IR-T) imaging. Initially, the forearm image captured by a thermal camera is segmented by crisp 2-means and filtered by Gaussian high-pass filter for smoothing and contrast enhancement. Four types of directional curvatures, achieved by second order derivatives including vertical, horizontal and two diagonal directions, are reproduced as four single images from scratch. The images are subsequently fused by fuzzy curvature method to produce the final images representing the complete vein system in the forearm. The fusion procedure by fuzzy inference system as an expert system could be stated as the main novelty in infrared thermal imaging which is also so flexible thanks to the parametric design. The intelligent recognition system also provides various clear screenings of the whole vein system in forearms depending on the parameters selected, even though the veins are totally invisible.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel extraction based method for multi-document summarization that covers three important features of a good summary: coverage, non-redundancy, and relevancy. The coverage and non-redundancy features are modeled to generate a single document from the multiple documents. These features are explored by the weighted combination of word embedding and Google based similarity methods. To accommodate the relevancy feature in the system generated summaries, the text summarization task is modeled as an optimization problem, where various text features with their optimized weights are used to score the sentences to find the relevant sentences. For feature's weight optimization, we use the meta-heuristic approach, Shark Smell Optimization (SSO). The experiments are performed on six benchmark datasets (DUC04, DUC06, DUC07, TAC08, TAC11, and MultiLing13) with the co-selection and content based performance parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is viable and effective for multi-document summarization. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Literature reviews are essential for any researcher trying to keep up to date with the burgeoning software engineering literature. Finding relevant papers can be hard due to the huge amount of candidates provided by search. FAST(2) is a novel tool for assisting the researchers to find the next promising paper to read. This paper describes FAST(2) and tests it on four large systematic literature review datasets. We show that FAST(2) robustly optimizes the human effort to find most (95%) of the relevant software engineering papers while also compensating for the errors made by humans during the review process. The effectiveness of FAST(2) can be attributed to three key innovations: (1) a novel way of applying external domain knowledge (a simple two or three keyword search) to guide the initial selection of papers-which helps to find relevant research papers faster with less variances; (2) an estimator of the number of remaining relevant papers yet to be found-which helps the reviewer decide when to stop the review; (3) a novel human error correction algorithm-which corrects a majority of human misclassifications (labeling relevant papers as non-relevant or vice versa) without imposing too much extra human effort.

AB Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been widely applied in expert systems. Traditional SVM works as a closed system, which means the parameters of the SVM freeze after training is finished. This strategy leads to the SVM cannot adapt to the online learning environment and also hinders the application of the SVM in expert systems which need to be updated in an online way. Many online SVMs retrain SVM with the current support vectors and new incoming data. However, the retained system usually shows a declined performance due to losing much information about the data. To handle this problem, we propose an Online Support Vector Machine (OSVM). The OSVM includes a Representative Prototype Area (RPA), which retains the representative data of all historical data. In the RPA, each class is maintained by an Online Incremental Feature Map (OIM) which learns a suitable representative set from the stream data automatically, e.g., we do not need to predefine a compression ratio, the OIM will dynamically adapt to the current input data. Retraining is periodically conducted on the updated OIM, which can avoid a declined performance and significantly reduce the computational cost. Variety data sets from different fields are used to test our method and the experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of OSVM is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art SVM and the speed of OSVM is much faster. Moreover, OSVM is more stable than the other methods in the open-ended learning environment, where stream data from novel classes occur. This implies the OSVM has a good application prospect in online learning expert systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Managing efficiently the flow of products throughout the supply chain is essential for succeeding in today's marketplace. We consider the Kanban (from Lean Management) and Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR, from the Theory of Constraints) scheduling mechanisms and evaluate their performance in a four-echelon supply chain operating within a large noise scenario. Through an agent-based system, which is presented as a powerful model-driven decision support system for managers, we show the lower sensitivity against variability and the higher financial performance of DBR, which occurs as this mechanism improves the supply chain robustness due to its bottleneck orientation. Nonetheless, we prove the existence of regions in the decision space where Kanban offers similar performance. This is especially relevant taking into account that Kanban can be implemented at a lower cost, as DBR requires a higher degree of information transparency and a solid contract between partners to align incentives. In this sense, we offer decision makers a methodological approach to reach an agreement when the partners decide to move from Kanban to DBR in a bid to increase the overall net profit in supply chains operating in a challenging noise scenario.

AB Traditionally, physicians need to manually delineate the suspected breast cancer area. Numerous studies have mentioned that manual segmentation takes time, and depends on the machine and the operator. The algorithm called Convolutional Neural Network Improvement for Breast Cancer Classification (CNNI-BCC) is presented to assist medical experts in breast cancer diagnosis in timely manner. The CNNI-BCC uses a convolutional neural network that improves the breast cancer lesion classification in order to help experts for breast cancer diagnosis. CNNI-BCC can classify incoming breast cancer medical images into malignant, benign, and healthy patients. The application of present algorithm can assist in classification of mammographic medical images into benign patient, malignant patient and healthy patient without prior information of the presence of a cancerous lesion. The presented method aims to help medical experts for the classification of breast cancer lesion through the implementation of convolutional neural network for the classification of breast cancer. CNNI-BCC can categorize incoming medical images as malignant, benign or normal patient with sensitivity, accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and specificity of 89.47%, 90.50%, 0.901 +/- 0.0314 and 90.71% respectively.

AB Medical image analysis is motivated by deep learning emergence and computation power increase. Meanwhile, relevant deep features can significantly enhance learnable expert and intelligent systems performance and reduce diagnosis time and arduousness. This paper presents a deep learning-based radiomics framework for aided diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. MR Images with histologically confirmed Liposarcoma (LPS) and Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) have been retrieved from the Cancer Imaging Archives database and pre-processed to recuperate ROls from MR scans with delineated tumors. This study investigates the significance and impact of medical image fusion on deep feature learning based on transfer learning from the natural domain to the medical domain. Towards this end, we propose to fuse T1 with T2FS or STIR modalities using type-2 fuzzy sets in the non-subsampled shearlet domain. Being decomposed, low-frequency sub-images were selected using local energy and type-2 fuzzy entropy, while high frequencies were selected according to the maximum of the absolute value. Experimental results indicated that the proposed fusion framework outperformed the state-of-the-art fuzzy logic-based fusion techniques in terms of entropy and mutual information. Accordingly, we fine-tuned the pre-trained AlexNet deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). First, with the pre-processed dataset, and second with the fused images. As a result, the average classification accuracy using the augmented training data by image rotation and flipping was 97.17% with the raw data and 98.28% with the fused images, which highlighted the usefulness of complementary information for deep feature learning. One crucial concern was to investigate the depth of knowledge transferability. We incrementally fine-tuned the pre-trained CNN to assess the required level that achieves performance improvements in STS classification. Through layer-wise fine-tuning, our study further confirms the potential of middle and deep layers in performance improvement. Moreover, the transferability was concluded better than random weights. With the encouragement of classification results, our aided diagnosis framework may be in the pipeline to assist radiologists in classifying LPS and LMS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Time series forecasting is important in many aspects of our lives, since it can be used to deal with the uncertainty to further support the decision making. Despite many advanced methodologies have been proposed, modelling the underlying relationship between past and future conditions is still a challenge. In this research, we develop a novel time series forecasting model which can effectively predict future conditions in a timely fashion. A time series has nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics which make prediction using statistical or computational intelligent methods a difficult task. Therefore, a hybrid deep learning and empirical mode decomposition model, namely EMD-SAE, for multistep ahead forecasting is proposed to predict the traffic flow and random time series. The performances of the proposed model are compared and discussed. This paper shows the potential of hybridizing the deep learning and empirical mode decomposition to the ordinary time series forecasting approach, and the experimental results suggest that the proposed EMD-SAE is reliable, suitable and a promising method for time series forecasting.

DE Pixel intensities; Non-parametric approach; Tumor identification
ID SEGMENTATION
AB Identification of tumor in medical images is an important task which leads to increased survival chances. In many cases, tumor diagnosis in medical images is very complicated since the pixel intensities between benign and malignant tissues may be very close. The identification problem is defined as the intensification of the mutual data between the image pixel intensities and the desired areas (tumors in this paper), depending on a limitation of the overall size of the desired area borders. This paper introduces a new approach for image segmentation in differentiating between benign and malignant tissues through a nonparametric approach. The proposed approach assumes that the probability densities correlated with pixel intensities in the image for each region are not already known. The image intensity is used instead of using the probability. A nonparametric density estimation is proposed and formulates the theoretical data optimization problem by applying curve evolution methods and deriving the correlated gradient flows. It uses level-set techniques to achieve the resulting evolution. The algorithm is applied to 100 sets of different real data in patient images with benign or/and malignant tissues. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm proved effective in tumor identification with an acceptable accuracy of 93.1%, especially in-patient images diagnosed with carcinoma at an early stage.

AB This study presents an asynchronous P300-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system for controlling social networking features of a smartphone. There are very few BCI studies based on these mobile devices and, to the best of our knowledge, none of them supports networking applications or are focused on an assistive context, failing to test their systems with motor-disabled users. Therefore, the aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to design and develop an asynchronous P300-based BCI system that allows users to control Twitter and Telegram in an Android device; and (ii) to test the usefulness of the developed system with a motor-disabled population in order to meet their daily communication needs. Row-col paradigm (RCP) is used in order to elicitate the P300 potentials in the scalp of the user, which are immediately processed for decoding the user's intentions. The expert system integrates a decision-making stage that analyzes the attention of the user in real-time, providing a comprehensive and asynchronous control. These intentions are then translated into application commands and sent via Bluetooth to the mobile device, which interprets them and provides visual feedback to the user. During the assessment, both qualitative and quantitative metrics were obtained, and a comparison among other state-ofthe-art studies was performed as well. The system was tested with 10 healthy control subjects and 18 motor-disabled subjects, reaching average online accuracies of 92.3% and 80.6%, respectively. Results suggest that the system allows users to successfully control two socializing features of a smartphone, bridging the accessibility gap in these trending devices. Our proposal could become a useful tool within households, rehabilitation centers or even companies, opening up new ways to support the integration of motor-disabled people, and making an impact in their quality of life by improving personal autonomy and self-dependence.

AB The Emergency and Security Coordinating Centre is the public service responsible for managing all the incidents registered in the Canary Islands. More than 7 million records have been collected in the last decade with more than twenty observed variables for each incident, which comprise more than 140 million data. All these data emanate from different islands and municipalities but with very marked differences. The study in this paper presents complete and novel research about geographical and temporal incident distribution, which may be of interest to emergency services managers and people responsible for designing public policies concerning security and health matters. We have developed an analytical web platform that features several dashboards with statistically significant results, by island, municipality, etc., and incorporating certain external data sources regarding social and economic issues which allow us to study the relationship between these factors and incident distribution at different geographical levels. Certain specific results are presented and illustrated in order to show all dimensions of data analytics that not only significantly improve companies' and organizations' processes, but also demonstrate how data analytics competency relates to decision making performance. Several statistical models that forecast and classify the incidents are proposed to illustrate the potential of statistical modelling in the study. The application has become into a crucial strategic tool for the organization because it helps in decision making processes. The information provided is highly modular and allows for the future inclusion of new features in order to provide larger and improved data analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many critical societal functions depend on uninterrupted service of civil engineering infrastructure. Railroads represent important infrastructure components of the transportation sector and provide both passenger and freight services. Railroad bridges over roadways are susceptible to impacts from overheight vehicles and equipment, which may damage bridge girders or supports and must be investigated after each event. One method of monitoring for vehicle-bridge collisions utilizes accelerometers to monitor for abnormal bridge vibrations corresponding to abnormal activity. Passing trains under normal operating conditions frequently produce significant bridge responses that have similar response characteristics to bridge strikes, but do not need to be investigated. This paper presents an expert system which comprises committees of artificial neural networks trained to interrogate data collected from accelerometers mounted on the bridge, assess the nature of the acceleration signal, and classify the event as either a passing train or a potentially damaging impact. This system is trained using acceleration time histories from accelerometers installed on 8 low-clearance rail bridges; no finite element model simulations were used for network training or data stream creation. The presented system accurately detects and classifies impacts with average impact detection performance ranging from 91-100% with average false positive rates limited to 0.00-0.75%.

AB Trend change prediction in complex systems with a large number of noisy time series is a problem with many applications for real-world phenomena, with stock markets as a notoriously difficult to predict example of such systems. We approach predictions of directional trend changes via complex lagged correlations between them, excluding any information about the target series from the respective inputs to achieve predictions purely based on such correlations with other series. We propose the use of deep neural networks that employ step-wise linear regressions with exponential smoothing in the preparatory feature engineering for this task, with regression slopes as trend strength indicators for a given time interval. We apply this method to historical stock market data from 2011 to 2016 as a use case example of lagged correlations between large numbers of time series that are heavily influenced by externally arising new information as a random factor. The results demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach, with state-of-the-art accuracies and accounting for the statistical significance of the results for additional validation, as well as important implications for modern financial economics.

ID MUTUAL INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK
AB Feature selection is an import preprocessing approach for machine learning and text mining. It reduces the dimensions of high-dimensional data. A popular approach is based on information theoretic measures. Most of the existing methods used two- and three-dimensional mutual information terms that are ineffective in detecting higher-order feature interactions. To fill this gap, we employ two- through five-way interactions for feature selection. We first identify a relaxed assumption to decompose the mutual information-based feature selection problem into a sum of low-order interactions. A direct calculation of the decomposed interaction terms is computationally expensive. We employ five-dimensional joint mutual information, a computationally efficient measure, to estimate the interaction terms. We use the 'maximum of the minimum' nonlinear approach to avoid the overestimation of the feature significance. We also apply the proposed method to text categorization. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compare it with eleven popular feature selection methods, eighteen benchmark data and seven text categorization data. Experimental results with four different types of classifiers provide concrete evidence that higher-order interactions are effective in improving feature selection methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Today, almost everybody has a smartphone and applications have been developed to help users to take decisions (e.g. which hotel to choose, which museum to visit, etc). In order to improve the recommendations of the mobile application, it is crucial to elicit the preference structures of the user. As problems are often based on several criteria, multicriteria decision aiding methods are most adequate in these cases, and past works have proposed indirect eliciting approaches for multicriteria decision aiding methods. However, they often do not aim of reducing as much as possible the cognitive efforts required by the user. This is prerequisite of mobile applications as they are used by everybody. In this work, the weights to assign to the evaluation criteria in a PROMETHEE-based ranking approach are unknown, and therefore must be elicited indirectly either from a partial ranking provided by the user or from the selection of his/her most preferred alternative into a subset of reference alternatives. In the latter case, the cognitive effort required by the decision-maker is minimal. Starting from a linear optimisation model aimed at searching for the most discriminating vector of weights, three quadratic variants are proposed subsequently to overcome the issues arising from the linear model. An iterative quadratic optimisation model is proposed to fit the real setting in which the application should operate, where the eliciting procedure must be launched iteratively and converge over time to the vector of weights, which are the weights that the user implicitly assigns to the evaluation criteria. Finally, three experiments are performed to confirm the effectiveness and the differences between the proposed models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Data centers are fundamental infrastructure for information technology and cloud services; however, their very high rates of energy consumption are a problem. The placement of Virtual Machines (VMs) to Physical Machines (PMs) in virtualized environments has a significant impact on the energy consumption of a data center. This is an NP-hard problem, for which an optimal solution is not practicable even for a small-scale data center. In this paper, we formulate placement of VMs to PMs in a data center as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem and make use of the information from PM and VM profiles to minimize the total energy consumption of all active PMs. An Ant Colony System (ACS) embedded with new heuristics is presented for an energy-efficient solution to the optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the ACS, simulation experiments are conducted on small-, medium- and large-scale data centers. The results from our ACS are compared with two existing ACS methods as well as the widely used First-Fit-Decreasing (FFD) algorithm. Our ACS is shown to outperform the two existing ACS methods and FFD in energy performance for all small-, medium- and large-scale test problems. Our ACS also exhibits good scalability with the increase in the problem size. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a singularity-free adaptive fuzzy backstepping control (AFBC) scheme is presented for uncertain nonlinear SISO systems with triangular structure by using dynamic surface control (DSC) design technique. As the intelligent approximator, fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate the continuous nonlinear unknown functions in the uncertain systems. By utilizing DSC design technique into AFBC design framework, the proposed intelligent-based adaptive control system can overcome the problem of "explosion of complexity" inherent in the backstepping design method. Moreover, the further benefits of the proposed intelligent-based adaptive control method are that the control singularity problem is completely prevented and the upper bounds of the time differential of the gain functions are no longer needed during the control scheme design. Based on the backstepping technique, it can be proven that the closed-loop system is stable in the sense that all the variables are guaranteed to be bounded. The simulation examples demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent-based adaptive control method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Pseudo-relevance feedback; Negative feedback; Positive feedback;

ID PSEUDO-RELEVANCE FEEDBACK
AB Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has evident potential for enriching the representation of short queries. Traditional PRF methods treat top-ranked documents as feedback, since they are assumed to be relevant to the query. However, some of these feedback documents may actually distract from the query topic for a range of reasons and accordingly downgrade PRF system performance. Such documents constitute negative examples (negative feedback) but could also be valuable in retrieval. In this paper, a novel framework of query language model construction is proposed in order to improve retrieval performance by integrating both positive and negative feedback. First, an improvement-based method is proposed to automatically identify the types of feedback documents (i.e. positive or negative) according to whether the document enhances the retrieval's effectiveness. Subsequently, based on the learned positive and negative examples, the positive feedback models and the negative feedback models are estimated using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm with the assumptions: the positive term distribution is affected by the context term distribution and the negative term distribution is affected by both the positive term distribution and the context term distribution (such that the positive feedback model upgrades the rankings of relevant documents and the negative feedback model prunes the irrelevant documents from a query). Finally, a content-based representativeness criterion is proposed in order to obtain the representative negative feedback documents. Experiments conducted on the TREC collections demonstrate that our proposed approach results in better retrieval accuracy and robustness than baseline methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer according to worldwide incidences statistics. The correct diagnosis of this lesion leads to the indication of the most adequate treatments for cancer-affected patients. The diagnosis is made through the visual analysis of tissue samples by pathologists. However, this analysis is susceptible to intra- and inter-pathologists variability in addition to being a complex and time-consuming task. To deal with these challenges, image processing methods are developed for application on histological images obtained through the digitization of the tissue samples. To do so, feature extraction and classification techniques are investigated to aid pathologists and make it possible a faster and more objective diagnosis definition. Therefore, in this work, we propose a method that associates multidimensional fractal techniques, curvelet transforms and Haralick descriptors for the study and pattern recognition of colorectal cancer, which not yet explored in the Literature. The proposed method considered a feature selection approach and different classification techniques for evaluating associations, such as decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, naive Bayes, k*, and a polynomial method. This strategy allowed for more precise interpretations regarding the best associations for the separation of groups concerning histological images of colorectal cancer. The proposal was tested on colorectal images from two distinct datasets commonly investigated in the Literature. The best result was reached with features based mainly on lacunarity and percolation obtained from curvelet sub-images, using a polynomial classifier. The tests were evaluated by applying the 10-fold cross-validation method and the result was 0.994 of AUC, which is a relevant contribution to the Literature of pattern recognition of colorectal cancer. The obtained performance with a detailed analysis involving different types of features and classifiers are important contributions for pathologists, specialists interested in the study of this cancer and histological image processing researchers, which aim to develop the clinically applicable computational techniques.

ID DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; EAGLE STRATEGY; DESIGN
AB In this study, the concept of a semi-independent variable (SIV) problem representation is investigated that embodies a set of expected or desired relationships among the original variables, with the goal of increasing search effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed approach intends to eliminate the generation of infeasible solutions associated with the known relationships among the variables and cutting the search space, thereby potentially improving a search algorithm's convergence rate and narrowing down the search space. However, this advantage does not come for free. The issue is the multiplicity of SIV formulations and their varying degree of complexity, especially with respect to variable interaction. In this paper, we propose the use of automatic variable interaction analysis methods to compare and contrast different SIV formulations. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by implementing it within a number of classical and evolutionary optimization algorithms (namely, interior-point algorithm, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm and differential evolution) in the application to several practical engineering problems. The case study results clearly show that the population-based algorithms can significantly benefit from the proposed SIV formulation resulting in better solutions with fewer function evaluations than in the original approach. The results also indicate that an automatic variable interaction analysis is capable of estimating the difficulty of the resultant SIV formulations prior to any optimization attempt.

AB Due to complexities of scene images, scene categorization is a challenging task in the computer vision community. To categorize scene images effectively, in this paper, we propose to coordinate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) to perform scene categorization with multi-views and multi-levels of abstraction. Specifically, to utilize the complementary properties of features of different levels of abstraction, we employ CNNs to extract features of multi-levels of abstraction based on its hierarchical structure. Furthermore, in order to deal with variations in scene image contents, we represent each image with multiple views, and in order to take correlation between image views into consideration, we treat image view features from the same image as a sequence and employ Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) to perform classification. Based on the proposed method, information of multi-views and multi-levels of abstraction can be made full use of in a single framework. We evaluate the proposed method on two challenging scene datasets, MIT indoor scene 67 and SUN 397. Obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing CNNs and LSTMs to categorize scene images with multi-views and multi-levels of abstraction. Experiments on comparison to state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed method outperforms all the other methods used for comparison. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cross purchase modeling (cross model) is a method to simultaneously analyze multiple product categories for their interrelated influences on consumers' decisions to purchase each category. Traditional econometric modeling methods are hard to compute and complex in model specifications. This paper examines an artificial neural network (ANN) approach in this context. To understand ANN models' performance in increasing data scale, this paper uses four datasets of 4, 8, 16 and 32 categories to train ANN models and make predictions. Results show that an ANN model of 12 hidden nodes can be trained in about 3 h and make 88% prediction hit rate for the 16-category dataset. In contrast, a traditional econometric model requires more than 300 h to finish computing for the 16-category dataset. A typical critique of ANN technique is that it hides learned knowledge inside its model structure. This is a major obstacle preventing ANN from being more frequently applied in business research and practices. The current study takes two approaches to address this issue, i.e., (1) customizing ANN components to allow prior knowledge plugging in, and (2) using the generalized weight technique to reveal knowledge that is embedded in ANN training results. Findings of this paper help managers understand applicability of ANN technique in cross purchase model. By demonstrating plugging in prior knowledge to ANN model training and extracting knowledge from ANN training results, this paper shows approaches for understanding ANN embedded knowledge.

AB Local binary pattern (LBP) has been successfully used in computer vision and pattern recognition applications, such as biomedical image analysis, remote sensing and image retrieval. However, the current LBP-based features, which assign a fixed sampling radius for all pixels in a single scale, completely ignore the fact that different central pixels actually have different local gray-value distributions and the proper sampling radius should be different for pixels. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective central pixel selection (CPS) strategy by using gradient information to classify central pixels of a texture image into different classes based on their local gray-value distributions. Then, we introduce this CPS strategy into the LBP framework and assign an adaptive sampling radius for each central pixel according to the class it belongs to. As a preprocessing step of LBP framework, this CPS strategy can also be integrated into any other LBP variants so as to extract more effective local texture features. Extensive experiments on five representative texture databases of Outex, UIUC, CUReT, UMD and ALOT validate the efficiency of the proposed central pixel selection (CPS) strategy, which can achieve almost 16% improvement over the original LBP and 1%-10% improvement compared with the best classification accuracy among other benchmarked state-of-the-art LBP variants.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel model to recommend possible research peers to a user efficiently. We model all the authors along with their attributes as an attributed graph and then perform community search on this attributed graph to find the most appropriate peer for a user. We propose algorithms to recommend a dynamic attributed graph efficiently and create a real-time community search model by deploying an incremental training algorithm. We also propose dynamic weighted attributes for each node (peer). Given a node and set of attributes (query), the proposed model is capable of self-expansion of the attribute set leading to a more significant match between two nodes. Our experimental results show that our proposed model achieved substantial performance gains over the existing models. In a nutshell, we present an intelligent system that incorporates the changes going on in the research world and suggest up-to-date recommendations. The proposed model is also robust enough to ensure that the recommendations do not suffer due to poor queries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Activation functions play a crucial role in discriminative capabilities of the deep neural networks. They are also one of the main reasons for revival of the neural networks. Although, recent activation functions provide solution to vanishing and exploding gradient problems, but they do not have sufficient capacity to model non-linear data. This paper proposes a novel activation function, which imparts neural networks with capability to model non-linear dependencies in data. Behavior of proposed activation function remains non-saturating even with non-linear structure. The activation function provides distinct activation behaviors to different data range segments. The paper presents two different variants of proposed function. The first, "linear sigmoidal activation" function is a fixed structure activation function with function coefficients defined at the start of model design. Whereas second, "adaptive linear sigmoidal activation" function is a trainable function which can adapt itself according to the complexity of the given data. Both of the proposed models are tested against the state of the art activation functions on benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, SVHN, FER-2013). The proposed activation function is able to outperforms every known activation functions in all the tests. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An optimization technique aims to find the best solution to an optimization problem. If the problem considers only one objective function, the best solution will provide the optimal value for such objective. However, if the problem considers two or more objectives, the selection of solutions will not be that straightforward since such objective functions are usually in conflict. For this kind of optimization problems, the use of analytical or exact methods becomes impractical. Thus, heuristic or metaheuristic approaches have to be applied for finding the optimal solutions or, at least, approximate solutions to the optimum. As a consequence, a wide variety of metaheuristics inspired by nature has been proposed for solving optimization problems. Among them, the Grey Wolf Optimizer is a metaheuristic of recent creation that in the last few years has attracted the attention of many researchers. Furthermore, a multi-objective extension of this technique was recently introduced proving its high performance comparable to other multi-objective optimization methods. In this paper, a multi-objective grey wolf optimizer based on the decomposition is introduced. Our proposed algorithm approximates Pareto solutions cooperatively by defining a neighborhood relation among the scalarizing subproblems in which the multi-objective problem is decomposed. The performance of our proposed method is compared against those achieved by six state-of-the-art bio-inspired techniques showing its high performance in both, well-known benchmark problems and two real-life engineering problems.

AB In this article we present a novel system for natural language generation (NLG) of Spanish sentences from a minimum set of meaningful words (such as nouns, verbs and adjectives) which, unlike other state-of-the-art solutions, performs the NLG task in a fully automatic way, exploiting both knowledge-based and statistical approaches. Relying on its linguistic knowledge of vocabulary and grammar, the system is able to generate complete, coherent and correctly spelled sentences from the main word sets presented by the user. The system, which was designed to be integrable, portable and efficient, can be easily adapted to other languages by design and can feasibly be integrated in a wide range of digital devices. During its development we also created a supplementary lexicon for Spanish, aLexiS, with wide coverage and high precision, as well as syntactic trees from a freely available definite-clause grammar. The resulting NLG library has been evaluated both automatically and manually (annotation). The system can potentially be used in different application domains such as augmentative communication and automatic generation of administrative reports or news. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID IMAGE SEGMENTATION
AB This research article proposes a novel edge scaled method with local and global region based statistical information for inhomogeneous image segmentation. We coordinate region force (local and global) term with geodesic edge term in level set formulation. The vital energy of the proposed model utilizes both global and local terms fused with compacted geodesic edge term in an additive fashion, which uses image gradient information to segment feeble boundaries inside images. The initialization of the level set is always vulnerable and its execution is liable to suitable initialization, which requires manual intercession. In this regard, the proposed method is extended and automated by integrating the proposed method with FCM (fuzzy c-means) clustering. Modified active contour method gets suitable initialization from FCM clustering, which eliminates the initial contour problem existed in the traditional region-based active contour methods. A development in this paper is to interface FCM with level set strategy by morphological tasks. Moreover, the uninterrupted segmentation scheme confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in modern intelligent and automatic systems. The experimental analysis is performed on synthetic and real inhomogeneous images. The visual and quantitative results confirm the proficiency of the proposed technique and show that proposed method achieves better accuracy results compared to previous methods.

AB User engagement (UE) is the quality of user experience that emphasizes any positive aspects of interaction with an application, and particularly the phenomena associated with being captivated by certain features included in it, thus being motivated to use it. In the context of mobile applications, measuring UE could provide insights to further explain usage behaviors, allowing developers, and product managers, to gain a better understanding of how users utilize their applications, and what drives their engagement with them. Numerous methods have been proposed in literature to measure UE in domains such as online services; however, not much had been done to model UE in the context of mobile applications. In response to this problem, our study proposes to measure UE with mobile applications by analyzing temporal changes in a defined set of usage metrics, yielding a general metric, a mobile application user engagement (MAUE) score, which is a linear combination of the UE time series metrics, accounting for the largest amount of the variance in usage data, and extracted by principal component analysis (PCA). Our proposed approach has been applied to the behavioral data of 40,004 unique users of The Weather Company mobile application. Our results indicate that time-dependent fluctuations of the MAUE score are characterized with a power-law decrease, in accordance with the power law of practice, suggesting different levels of UE stability for the different mobile platforms (i.e., IOS, Android). Additionally, the Multidimensional scaling distance between clusters of variables loadings, and among the variables loadings within each cluster with regards to the amount of usage days, could be used to map the UE motivations and thus provide product managers an improved understanding and prediction ability of the influence of different app updates and product interventions on UE.

AB The traditional frame-based speech features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are specifically developed for speech/speaker recognition tasks. Speech is different from acoustic events, when one considers its phonetic structure. Hence, frame-based speech features may not be suitable for Acoustic Event Classification (AEC). In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the extraction of robust acoustic event specific features from the spectrogram using a left singular vector for AEC. It consists of two main stages: segmentation and characterization of acoustic event spectrograms. In the first stage, symmetric Laplacian matrix of an acoustic event spectrogram is decomposed into singular values and vectors. Then, reliable region (spectral shape) of an acoustic from the spectrogram is segmented using a left singular vector. The selected prominent values of a left singular vector using the proposed threshold, automatically segment the reliable region of an acoustic event from the spectrogram. In the second stage, the segmented region of the spectrogram is used as a feature vector for AEC. Characteristics of values of singular vector belonging to reliable (event) and unreliable (non-event) regions of the spectrogram are determined. To evaluate the proposed approach, different categories of 'home' acoustic events are considered from the Freiburg-106 dataset. The results show that the significantly improved performance of acoustic event segmentation and classification. A singular vector effectively segments the reliable region of the acoustic event from spectrogram for Support Vector Machine (SVM) based AEC system. The proposed AEC system is robust to noise and achieves higher recognition rate in clean and noisy conditions compared to the traditional speech feature based systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Accurate and reliable travel time predictions in public transport networks are essential for delivering an attractive service that is able to compete with other modes of transport in urban areas. The traditional application of this information, where arrival and departure predictions are displayed on digital boards, is highly visible in the city landscape of most modern metropolises. More recently, the same information has become critical as input for smart-phone trip planners in order to alert passengers about unreachable connections, alternative route choices and prolonged travel times. More sophisticated Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) include the predictions of connection assurance, i.e. an expert system that will decide to hold services to enable passenger exchange, in case one of the services is delayed up to a certain level. In order to operate such systems, and to ensure the confidence of passengers in the systems, the information provided must be accurate and reliable. Traditional methods have trouble with this as congestion, and thus travel time variability, increases in cities, consequently making travel time predictions in urban areas a non-trivial task. This paper presents a system for bus travel time prediction that leverages the non-static spatio-temporal correlations present in urban bus networks, allowing the discovery of complex patterns not captured by traditional methods. The underlying model is a multi-output, multi-time-step, deep neural network that uses a combination of convolutional and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers.
   The method is empirically evaluated and compared to other popular approaches for link travel time prediction and currently available services, including the currently deployed model at Movia, the regional public transport authority in Greater Copenhagen. We find that the proposed model significantly outperforms all the other methods we compare with, and is able to detect small irregular peaks in bus travel times very quickly.

AB The high level of air pollution in urban areas, caused in no small extent by road transport, requires the implementation of continuous and accurate monitoring techniques if emissions are to be minimized. The primary motivation for this paper is to enable fine spatiotemporal monitoring based on crowd sensing, whereby the instantaneous fuel consumption of a vehicle is estimated using smartphone measurements. To this end, a surrogate method based on indirect monitoring using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that process a smartphone's GPS position, speed, altitude, acceleration and number of visible satellites is proposed. Extensive field trials were conducted to gather smartphone and fuel consumption data at a wide range of driving conditions. Two different RNN types were explored, and a parametric analysis was performed to define a suitable architecture. Various training methods for tuning the RNN were evaluated based on performance and computational burden. The resulting estimator was compared with others found in the literature, and the results confirm its superior performance. The potential impact of the proposed method is noteworthy as it can facilitate accurate monitoring of in-use vehicle fuel consumption and emissions at large scales by exploiting available smartphone measurements.

AB Classification of texture patterns with large scale variations poses a great challenge for expert and intelligent systems. A pure learning approach addresses this issue by including texture patterns at all scales in the training dataset. This approach makes the construction of an expert system quite costly and unrealistic given the large variations in real-world texture scales and patterns. We propose a transfer learning approach where the full range of texture scales is available only for a small subset of the texture classes. Such a subset is used to learn the scaling map through partial least-square regression or coupled dictionary learning. Experimental results on classifiers equipped with the learned maps show promising reduction in training data scale variability with improved classification accuracy compared to the data-intensive pure learning approach. The proposed approach can be followed to build image-based expert systems of reasonable accuracy and limited data requirements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Glaucoma along with diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of vision blindness and is projected to affect over 80 million people by 2020. Recently, expert systems have matched human performance in disease diagnosis and proven to be highly useful in assisting medical experts in the diagnosis and detection of diseases. Hence, automated optic disc detection through intelligent systems is vital for early diagnosis and detection of Glaucoma. This paper presents a multi-parametric optic disk detection and localization method for retinal fundus images using region-based statistical and textural features. Highly discriminative features are selected based on the mutual information criterion and a comparative analysis of four benchmark classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost and RusBoost is presented. The results of the proposed RF classifier based pipeline demonstrate its highly competitive performance (accuracies of 0.993, 0.988 and 0.993 on the DRIONS, MESSIDOR and ONHSD databases) with the stateof-the-art, thus making it a suitable candidate for patient management systems for early diagnosis of the Glaucoma.

AB Background: The current Ebola outbreak in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the second largest in history and the first in which the recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus - Zaire Ebolavirus (rVSV-ZEBOV) vaccine has been used at scale. We assessed side-effects, satisfaction, and attitudes toward the new vaccine.
   Methods: Cross-sectional survey questionnaire from a convenience sample of 90 vaccine recipients and 96 community controls in Eastern DRC.
   Results: Side-effects were reported in 75/90 (83%) vaccine recipients but only 5 (7%) and 4 (5%) reported arthralgia and rash, respectively. 76/90 (84%) vaccinees were classified as "promoters" (would recommend vaccine to others) and 6/90 (7%) as "detractors." 69/96 (72%) of unvaccinated community controls would wish to be vaccinated if supply were available. 153/186 (82%) would accept vaccination for family members.
   Conclusions: The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was well tolerated, with high acceptability in the community during the current outbreak in the DRC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Compared to hosting populations, immigrants are usually considered more vulnerable to communicable diseases, many of which are vaccine-preventable. This study aims to estimate vaccination coverage (VC) and timeliness in children born to women from high migratory pressure countries (HMPC) and to evaluate factors affecting differences with children born to Italian women or women from advanced development countries (ITA + ADC).
   Methods: We retrospectively analysed data of children born in 2009-2014 and resident in areas served by three local health units in the cities of Rome (n = 40,284), Turin (n = 49,600), and Treviso (n = 20,080). Data were retrieved through record-linkage of the population, vaccination, and birth registries. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate VCs at different ages for the 3rd dose of vaccine against tetanus and the 1st dose of vaccines against measles and meningococcal group C. Factors affecting differences in VCs by citizenship were evaluated using log-binomial models.
   Results: In Rome, VCs at 2 years of age were consistently higher in children born to ITA + ADC women than in children born to HMPC women, while differences in VCs by citizenship varied according to antigen and birth-cohort in Turin and Treviso, respectively. Where differences were observed, these were only partially explained by the mother's socio-demographic characteristics, level of utilisation of health-services during pregnancy, and maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes. Finally, we observed a reduction of VCs in recent birth cohorts (2012-14 vs. 2009-11), especially in children born to ITA + ADC women.
   Conclusions: Differences in VCs by citizenship were not homogeneous and varied according to geographical context, antigen, and birth-cohort. These differences are likely to be also affected by informal barriers (e.g., linguistic and cultural barriers), which should be addressed in implementing strategies to increase vaccine uptake in foreign children. Moreover, our results suggest that effective strategies to promote vaccinations in the autochthonous population are also needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection testing among persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is necessary to appropriately care for these patients, yet uptake of HBV testing and vaccination in this population is suboptimal.
   Methods: In a retrospective cohort analysis, we describe the prevalence of hepatitis B testing, linkage to hepatitis B care, and hepatitis B vaccination in patients with HCV infection within a large urban safety-net health system. Using a registry of HCV-infected patients with patient-level electronic health record data, that included demographic, clinical, and laboratory information from 2004 to 2016 from Grady Health System in Atlanta, GA, we describe (1) The prevalence of hepatitis B testing (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], core antibody [anti-HBc] surface antibody [anti-HBs]); (2) The proportion of HBsAg-positive persons receiving HBV DNA and e-antigen (HBeAg) as indicators for linkage to hepatitis B-directed care; and (3) The proportion of persons receiving hepatitis B vaccine.
   Results: Of 4224 HCV-infected patients, 3629 (86%) had test results for HBsAg and 43 (1.2%) were HBsAg positive. Of 2342 (55%) with test results for all three HBV serological markers, median age was 60 years, 67% were male, and 83% were African-American, 789 (34%) anti-HBc positive only, 678 (29%) anti-HBc/anti-HBs positive, 190 (8.1%) anti-HBs positive only, and 642 (27%) were HBV-susceptible. Of HBsAg positive patients, 21% received HBV DNA and 40% HBeAg testing. The proportion of HBV-susceptible patients receiving at least 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine was 322/642 (50%).
   Conclusions: In a large cohort of HCV-infected patients, we found a high prevalence of current or past HBV infection, but there were gaps in complete hepatitis B testing, hepatitis B-directed care, and hepatitis B vaccination. Strategies are needed to increase hepatitis B testing, linkage to care, and administration of the hepatitis B vaccine for HCV-infected persons in this healthcare system. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is a major pathogen causing streptococcosis in swine, resulting in significant losses in swine breeding worldwide. We previously reported that the non-antibiotic-resistant double-mutant strain Delta SspepO/Delta SspspC can be used as a live vaccine, providing effective protection against S. suis 2 infections in mice. This study aimed to understand the characteristics of streptococcosis and develop vaccine candidates for immunization. Intramuscular injection of live S. suis Delta SspepO/Delta SspspC in pigs induced discernable antibody production and provided cross-protection against challenges by a type 2 strain (100% protection) and a type 7 strain (60% protection). Protection was evaluated via clinical, bacteriological, serological, and post-mortem examinations. Furthermore, vaccination induced the production of opsonizing antibodies against serotypes 2 and 7. Analysis of IgG subclasses (IgG1 and IgG2a) revealed that both Th1 and Th2 responses were induced by S. suis Delta SspepO/Delta SspspC, although the IgG2a (Thl) response predominated over the IgG1 (Th2) response. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to establish a live vaccine candidate to protect against two major S. suis serotypes. Further studies are required to assess these candidate vaccines and examine their feasibility in providing cross-protection against S. suis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Using the data from the HERACLES clinical surveillance study (2007-2016), we describe the population impact of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PVC13) on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children <15 years of age in the Community of Madrid, Spain. After six years of the inclusion of PCV13 in the vaccination calendar (2010-2016), and despite changes in the Regional Immunization Programme that limited its availability, the net benefit incidence rate (IR) of IPD fell by 70.1% (IRR 0.3 [95% CI: 0.22-0.4]; p <= 0.001), mainly due to a significant reduction (91%) in the PCV13 serotypes (IRR 0.09 [95% CI: 0.05-0.16], p <= 0.001). Furthermore, no significant changes were detected in the IR of IPD caused by non-PCV13 serotypes. The IRs of the aggressive, resistant and most prevalent serotype in the analysed population, the 19A serotype, dramatically decreased from the beginning to the end of the study (98%) [IRR 0.03 (95% CI: 0.00-0.19), p <= 0.001], to its almost total disappearance. Remarkably, this reduction led to a pronounced decline in the percentage of cefotaxime-resistant isolates and the incidence of meningitis cases. Assessment of the clinical impact revealed a reduction in the number of all clinical presentations of IPD, confirming the effectiveness of the PCV13. Finally, PCV13 detected by PCR is predicted to have a stronger impact than the one based on culture methods, which can overlook more than 20% of cases of IPD, mainly pleural empyemas.

AB Background: Two electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays were developed which, together, can simultaneously measure serum antibodies against pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (PnPS) for 17 sero-types. The assays were validated for the 13 PnPS included in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). As recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), we compared the ECL assays with the WHO reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and derived a threshold corresponding to the 0.35 mu g/mL threshold established for the WHO reference ELISA for the non-inferiority comparison and licensure of new PCVs against invasive pneumococcal disease.
   Methods: A panel of 452 serum samples from children vaccinated with one of the three licensed PCVs was assessed with the ECL assays and the WHO reference ELISA. The ECL assay threshold for the aggregated seven PnPS included in the 7-valent PCV (PCV7) and serotype-specific thresholds were determined using a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve-based approach and Deming regression. To evaluate concordance between the ECL assays and the WHO reference ELISA, serostatus agreement rates between both assays and geometric means of the ratios (GMRs) of concentrations obtained with both assays were calculated.
   Results: The thresholds for the seven aggregated PCV7 serotypes obtained with the ROC curve-based approach and Deming regression approximated 0.35 mu g/mL (0.38 and 0.34 mu g/mL, respectively). Individual thresholds for the PCV13 serotypes ranged between 0.24 and 0.51 mu g/mL across both approaches. Serostatus agreement rates using a 0.35 mu g/mL threshold for both assays were >= 86.9% for all PCV13 serotypes. GMRs ranged between 0.85 and 1.25 for 11/13 serotypes and were <1.29 for the two remaining serotypes.
   Conclusion: The ECL assays were comparable to the WHO reference ELISA and offer a sensitive, time- and serum volume-saving method to quantify serotype-specific anti-PnPS antibodies in pediatric sera. A 035 mu g/mL threshold will be used for each PCV13 serotype to assess PCV immunogenicity in clinical trials. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Due in part to declining vaccination rates, in 2018 over 20 states reported at least one case of measles, and over 40,000 cases were confirmed in Europe. Anti-vaccine posts on social media may be facilitating anti-vaccination behaviour. This study aimed to systematically characterize (1) individuals known to publicly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, (2) the information they convey, and (3) the spread of this content.
   Methods: Our data set consisted of 197 individuals who posted anti-vaccination comments in response to a message promoting vaccination. We systematically analysed publicly-available content using quantitative coding, descriptive analysis, social network analysis, and an in-depth qualitative assessment. The final codebook consisted of 26 codes; Cohen's kappa ranged 0.71-1.0 after double-coding.
   Results: The majority (89%) of individuals identified as female. Among 136 individuals who divulged their location, 36 states and 8 other countries were represented. In a 2-mode network of individuals and topics, modularity analysis revealed 4 distinct sub-groups labelled as "trust," "alternatives," "safety," and "conspiracy." For example, a comment representative of "conspiracy" is that poliovirus does not exist and that pesticides caused clinical symptoms of polio. An example from the "alternatives" sub-group is that eating yogurt cures human papillomavirus. Deeper qualitative analysis of all 197 individuals' profiles found that these individuals also tended to post material against other health-related practices such as water fluoridation and circumcision.
   Conclusions: Social media outlets may facilitate anti-vaccination connections and organization by facilitating the diffusion of centuries old arguments and techniques. Arguments against vaccination are diverse but remain consistent within sub-groups of individuals. It would be valuable for health professionals to leverage social networks to deliver more effective, targeted messages to different constituencies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In China, cats cause about 5% of human rabies cases. Rabies control in cats plays a role in achieving the ultimate goal of elimination of dog rabies-mediated human deaths. However, there is no cat-specific rabies vaccine in China yet. In this study, we constructed a recombinant rabies vaccine by using a felid herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) isolate, and deleted the gl/E in the FHV-1 and replaced the region with a glycoprotein (G) of rabies virus (RABV) strain BD06 through homologous recombination. The recombinant virus FHV-RVG was recovered and purified, and the expression of RABV glycoprotein was verified by indirect immunofluorescent assay. For potency in cats, each animal was inoculated intranasally with 1 ml FHV-RVG at 10(6.5) TCID50. Blood samples were collected at defined intervals for antibody titration. The animals were challenged by herpes and rabies after completion of vaccination on day 180 and day 194, respectively. Our results demonstrated all vaccinated cats generated antibodies against both FHV-1 and RABV, and reached an arbitrary protective titer > 0.5 IU/ml for rabies viral neutralizing antibody (VNA) by day 14 post inoculation (dpi) and titer peaked on 30 dpi with VNA at 24.5 +/- 10.23 IU/ml. All vaccinated cats presented no clinical signs of FHV-1 infection and survived rabies challenge, while the control cats had severe rhinotracheitis and died from rabies after challenge. All this demonstrated that the FHV-based recombinant vaccine is effective in protection against both FHV-1 and RABV infections. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Since 2012, H7N3 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has produced negative economic and animal welfare impacts on poultry in central Mexico. In the present study, chickens were vaccinated with two different recombinant fowlpox virus vaccines (rFPV-H7/3002 with 2015 H7 hemagglutinin [HA] gene insert, and rFPV-H7/2155 with 2002 H7 HA gene insert), and were then challenged three weeks later with H7N3 HPAI virus (A/chicken/Jalisco/CPA-37905/2015). The rEPV-H7/3002 vaccine conferred 100% protection against mortality and morbidity, and significantly reduced virus shed titers from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In contrast, 100% of sham and rEPV-H7/2155 vaccinated birds shed virus at higher titers and died within 4 days. Pre- (15/20) and post- (20/20) challenge serum of birds vaccinated with rFPV-H7/3002 had antibodies detectable by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using challenge virus antigen. However, only a few birds (3/20) in the rFPV-H7/2155 vaccinated group had antibodies that reacted against the challenge strain but all birds had antibodies that reacted against the homologous vaccine antigen (A/turkey/Virginia/SEP-66/2002) (20/20). One possible explanation for differences in vaccines efficacy is the antigenic drift between circulating viruses and vaccines. Molecular analysis demonstrated that the Mexican H7N3 strains have continued to rapidly evolve since 2012. In addition, we identified in silico three potential new N-glycosylation sites on the globular head of the H7 HA of A/chicken/Jalisco/CPA-37905/2015 challenge virus, which were absent in 2012 H7N3 outbreak virus. Our results suggested that mutations in the HA antigenic sites including increased glycosylation sites, accumulated in the new circulating Mexican H7 HPAIV strains, altered the recognition of neutralizing antibodies from the older vaccine strain rFPV-H7/2155. Therefore, the protective efficacy of novel rFPV-H7/3002 against recent outbreak Mexican H7N3 HPAIV confirms the importance of frequent updating of vaccines seed strains for long-term effective control of H7 HPAI virus.

TI Caregiver's attitudes, beliefs, and experiences for influenza
   vaccination in Australian children with medical comorbidities
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Influenza vaccine; Children; Medical comorbidity; Survey
ID COVERAGE
AB Background: Influenza vaccination is recommended and funded for Australian children with medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe influenza. Despite this, influenza vaccine coverage remains low within this population. We examined caregivers' attitudes and practices for influenza vaccination in children with medical comorbidities.
   Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted with caregivers of children (6 months to <18 years old) with medical comorbidities attending sub-speciality paediatric outpatient clinics at the Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne), Princess Margaret Hospital (Perth), and Leading Steps private paediatric clinic (Gold Coast). Multivariate linear regression was used to identify surveys responses predictive of receipt of influenza vaccination in 2017.
   Results: From the 611 surveys collected, 556 were suitable for analysis. Caregiver reported 2017 influenza vaccine coverage was 52.2% in children with medical comorbidities. Caregivers who believed influenza vaccines to be >= 50% effective were more likely to vaccinate their children (adjusted Odds Ratio [a043.79 (2.41; 5.96). Those who expressed concerns about vaccine side effects were less likely to vaccinate their children (aOR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.30; 0.80]). Influenza vaccine uptake was significantly more likely for children who had been previously recommended influenza vaccination by their hospital-based physician (aOR: 4.33 [95% CI: 2.58; 7.27]) and had previously received a hospital-based vaccination (aOR: 3.11 [95% CI 1.79; 5.40]). Hospital-based physicians were also caregivers' most commonly reported source of trusted vaccination information (63.5%). Whilst only 29.3% of caregivers reported their child had been recommended influenza vaccination during a previous admission, 80.1% of caregivers stated they were receptive to their child receiving potential future influenza vaccinations during hospitalisations.
   Conclusions: Reported influenza vaccination coverage in children with medical comorbidities remains inadequate. An important finding of this study is that influenza vaccination recommendation by children's hospital physicians and previous vaccine receipt in hospital was associated with vaccine uptake. Opportunities for vaccination, especially during hospitalisation, must be examined. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Salmonella Typhi is responsible for typhoid fever in humans. Despite the efforts, the development of longlasting vaccines has failed and the available vaccines display only moderate activity, being considered as "international traveler's" vaccines. Taking advantage of the previously described implantable vaccine technology consisting on 3D laser-microstructured Si scaffolds loaded with antigen-seeded macrophages, the present study aimed to apply an antigenic stimulus of whole extracts of S. Typhimurium, which is the mouse analogue of the human Salmonella Typhi, and examine its ability to mount specific antibody response. After defining the experimental conditions for specific anti-S. Typhimurium IgG production in vitro, antigen-seeded macrophages loaded onto the 3D Si-scaffolds were implanted to mice, while parallel experiments used conventional Freund-complete-adjuvant vaccination protocols. The results showed that only the implantable vaccine protocol could mount a specific antibody response 14 days after implantation. The cytokine profile showed increase of IL-10 and IFN-gamma in the case of implantable and conventional vaccination respectively, 7 days after implantation. Morphological studies on the excised scaffolds 14 days after implantation, showed the development of a well-structured adherent monolayer, establishing multiple contacts with lymphocytes in favor to immune response development. Based on the hypothesis that both stimulatory and suppressive components in the vaccination preparation, could affect the overall activity, peptidoglycan was applied as an antigen to the vaccination protocols. Surprisingly, peptidoglycan was shown to induce a mitogenic rather than specific immunogenic response. In this case, histological analysis of the excised scaffolds showed a restricted layer of adherent cells with cytoplasmic extensions, but hard to distinguish cell contacts with lymphocytes. Finally, the presented results showed a differential behavior of antigen presenting cells in accordance to the antigenic stimulus and consequently the activation state of the cells. Tailoring the micro/sub-micron 3D structures and chemistry of Si scaffolds, could control cell behavior according to the user's needs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Targeting and vaccine durability are key for population-level impact and
   cost-effectiveness of a pox-protein HIV vaccine regimen in South Africa

AB Background: RV144 is to date the only HIV vaccine trial to demonstrate efficacy, albeit rapidly waning over time. The HVTN 702 trial is currently evaluating in South Africa a similar vaccine formulation to that of RV144 for subtype C HIV with additional boosters (pox-protein regimen). Using a detailed stochastic individual-based network model of disease transmission calibrated to the HIV epidemic, we investigate population-level impact and maximum cost of an HIV vaccine to remain cost-effective.
   Methods: Consistent with the original pox-protein regimen, we model a primary series of five vaccinations meeting the goal of 50% cumulative efficacy 24 months after the first dose and include two-yearly boosters that maintain durable efficacy over 10 years. We simulate vaccination programs in South Africa starting in 2027 under various vaccine targeting and HIV treatment and prevention assumptions.
   Results: Our analysis shows that this partially effective vaccine could prevent, at catch-up vaccination with 60% coverage, up to 941,000 (15.6%) new infections between 2027 and 2047 assuming current trends of antiretroviral treatment. An impact of up to 697,000 (11.5%) infections prevented could be achieved by targeting age cohorts of highest incidence. Economic evaluation indicates that, if treatment scale-up was achieved, vaccination could be cost-effective at a total cost of less than $385 and $62 per 10year series (cost-effectiveness thresholds of $5,691 and $750).
   Conclusions: While a partially effective, rapidly waning vaccine could help to prevent HIV infections, it will not eliminate HIV as a public health priority in sub-Saharan Africa. Vaccination is expected to be most effective under targeted delivery to age groups of highest HIV incidence. Awaiting results of trial, the introduction of vaccination should go in parallel with continued innovation in HIV prevention, including studies to determine the costs of delivery and feasibility and further research into products with greater efficacy and durability.

AB Background: Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) via intradermal (ID) administration is standard practice in Asia. Accumulating evidence suggests that PEP shortened to 3 visits in one week does not adversely affect seroconversion rates or immune memory.
   Objective: To determine whether the seroconversion rate at Day14 with a 1-week, 4-site (4-4-4-0-0) ID vaccination regimen with or without rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) was non-inferior to the updated Thai Red Cross (TRC) 28-day, 2-site (2-2-2-0-2) ID regimen with RIG during rabies PEP. We also assessed one-year antibody persistence.
   Methods: This phase III, mono-center, open-label, randomized-controlled trial assigned participants aged <= 50 years (n = 600) exposed to suspected rabid animals and sustaining WHO Category II injuries (automatic allocation to G1) or Category III injuries (randomized to G2 or G3) to the following groups (1:1:1 ratio): G1 (n = 200), 1-week 4-site ID regimen with the purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV; Verorab (R)) without RIG; G2 (n = 201), 1-week 4-site ID regimen with PVRV, and purified equine rabies immunoglobulin (pERIG); G3 (n = 199), TRC 28-day, 2-site ID regimen with PVRV, and pERIG. Non-inferiority tests compared G1 vs. G3 and G2 vs. G3. Seroconversion rate was the proportion (%) of vaccinees with rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) titers >= 0.5 IU/mL measured by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test.
   Results: On Day14, after the third vaccine administration, seroconversion rates were non-inferior in both comparisons and were, respectively, 100%, 99.4%, 98.8% in G1, G2, G3 with a decrease to 97.6%, 89%, 79.8% at Year 1. At Day14, RVNA geometric mean titers were 11.3 IU/mL; 9.89 IU/mL; 6.15 IU/mL, respectively, decreasing to 2.96 IU/mL, 1.37 IU/mL, 0.97 IU/mL at Year1. Safety and tolerability were similar between the three groups.
   Conclusion: The seroconversion rate at Day 14 with the 1-week 4-site ID regimen, both with and without pERIG, was non-inferior to the reference TRC 28-day 2-site ID regimen with pERIG during rabies PEP with PVRV. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of various factors that may influence the immunologic response to hepatitis A mono-vaccine or hepatitis A/B co-vaccine (Twinrix (R)) in HIV-infected patients.
   Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
   Methods: HIV positive patients with a full course of hepatitis A vaccine were tested for HAV antibodies. The seroconversion rates were determined, and the influence of several factors including CD4 cell counts, CD4/CD8 ratio, plasma viral load, type of vaccine, and antiretroviral therapy at the time of vaccine, was evaluated.
   Results: After vaccination, 80.2% of the patients developed anti-HAV antibodies, 81.5% in the mono-vaccine group and 79.2% in the hepatitis A/B co-vaccine group. In the mono-vaccine group, factors significantly associated with a better response to the vaccine were higher CD4 cell count, higher CD4/CD8 ratio, and shorter time interval from vaccine to serological control. In patients who received the hepatitis A/B co-vaccine, younger age and female sex were significantly associated with better vaccine response. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed time interval from vaccine to serological control of more than 5 years vs. less than 1 year to be significantly associated with decrease of seroconversion after HAV vaccine.
   Conclusions: The response to hepatitis A vaccine is impaired in HIV positive patients. HIV patients, at least those older than 30, should be tested for seroconversion after receiving the hepatitis A vaccine. As hepatitis A titers may rapidly decline, control serology during follow-up should be proposed, possibly within two years. However, vaccine type does not play a role in vaccine response.

AB Testing different pHs, dissolved oxygen concentrations and temperatures, plus the addition of inducers, to optimize ligninolytic enzyme activity, resulted in increased production of laccases, total peroxidases and manganese peroxidases on the order of 2.1-fold, 4.6-fold and 10-fold, respectively; laccases reached 6588 U/mL, total peroxidases reached 3533 U/mL and manganese peroxidase achieved 60 U/mL. Furthermore, an increase in laccase volumetric productivity and in its specific activity was verified. The addition of inducers, such as copper sulphate and manganese sulphate, improved enzymatic activity. In addition, a new previously unidentified laccase isoform was documented by zymography. The present work successfully increased the production of ligninolytic enzymes.

AB The alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors are attractive antiepileptic targets responsible for mediating the majority of excitatory neurotransmission and plasticity. The noncompetitive antagonists obtain more and more attention as drug candidates for treatment of the neurological diseases involving excessive activity of AMPARs, due to they regulate AMPA receptors (AMPARs) activity independently of endogenous glutamate levels unlike the competitive antagonists. Development of novel AMPAR noncompetitive antagonists, which are safer and more efficacious than competitive antagonists, is highly under demand. Here, we present the discovery of novel antagonists against AMPAR through Structure-Based Virtual Screening (SBVS). Three compounds were successfully distinguished by several different filtering strategies, namely STOCK6S-10902, STOCK1N-49134 and STOCK5S-68665. The interaction mode of these compounds was further explored through molecular dynamics simulation, binding free energy calculation and the binding free energy decomposition. It is demonstrated that some residues within the binding pocket, which have been proved their importance in antagonist binding and gating, form strong hydrogen bond interactions with these three molecules. In particular, H-bond interactions with high occupancies between Ser516, Ser788 and STOCK6S-10902 and Ser516, Asn791 and STOCK1N-49134 were observed. The three hit compounds with new scaffolds and the detailed binding modes could potentially serve as a starting point for further optimization and development.

AB Paenibacillus polymyxa is a rhizobacterium that has attracted substantial attention due to its ability to produce functional metabolites and promote plant growth. Metabolic and genetic improvements in this species will benefit research and other applications of the bacterium. However, a suitable gene expression system has not been established in this species. In this study, a promoter trap system based on a green fluorescent protein and a chloramphenicol-resistance gene was developed to isolate native promoters of P. polymyxa SC2-M1 to regulate gene expression. Through high-throughput screening, the novel promoter PLH-77 was identified, sequenced, and subsequently characterized. Promoter PLH-77 is a strong, continuous expression system containing the typical -10 and -35 motifs regions. Its effective sequence was evaluated and then cascaded to improve the promotion efficiency. To further verify the existence of PLH-77, a heterogenous xylose isomerase was expressed by PLH-77 in P. polymyxa SC2-M1. In the resulting strain, the amount of xylose consumed was increased by 2.5 g/L during the 78 h fermentation period. Meanwhile, the production levels of lactate and acetate increased. It was confirmed that promoter PLH-77 could effectively mediate gene expression in P. polymyxa SC2-M1 and will further benefit the quantitative monitoring of gene expression in P. polymyxa.

AB This study disserts on the exploitation of olive mill wastewater (OMW) for the production of both bio-based poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and hydrogen (H-2) by using the residual effluent as feedstock for growing purple bacteria after the recovery of hydroxytyrosol-rich mixtures. In particular, Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-FVPT5 was fed with either the virgin OMW or dephenolized-OMW (d-OMW). For polyphenols removal, the OMW was treated with activated carbon; subsequently, acidified ethanol (pH = 3.1) at 50 degrees C was used as extractor solvent for obtaining hydroxytyrosol-rich mixtures. The maximum hydroxytyrosol content in the resultant polyphenolic mixture was 2.02 g/L. The highest co-production of PHB (315 mg PHB/L) and H-2 (2236 mL H-2/L) were achieved feeding Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-FVPT5 with pure d-OMW. The highest hydrogen yield (4.55 L(H-2)/Ld-OMW) was obtained feeding the bacterium with d-OMW, diluted at 25%; by increasing the content of d-OMW into the culture broth the hydrogen yield progressively decreased. Lower results were obtained by feeding the bacterium with a synthetic medium, the cumulative hydrogen was 1855 mL H-2/L); the PHB was 101 mg PHB/L. The highest theoretical light conversion efficiency was 2.36% with the synthetic medium and 1.99% when feeding Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-FVPT5 with d-OMW diluted with water 50%, v/v.

AB Cyanobacteria based photosynthetic biomanufacturing is supposed to be one of the alternative routes for sustainable production of biofuels and biochemicals. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 is a promising cyanobacterial chassis strain possessing desired properties for scaled cultivation in future. Development of cyanobacterial cell factories requires modifications of PCC7002 chromosome to expand the photosynthesis-based metabolism networks. Therefore, mining genomic neutral sites for stable integration of heterologous genes and pathways would be of great significance for expanding the toolbox for PCC7002 genome engineering. Here we demonstrate a paradigm for identification of potential neutral sites from chromosome of PCC7002 based on genomic and transcriptomics data. By refining the massive omics information from database, 51 putative sites with no significant physiological or metabolism effects were extracted as candidates. Combining genomic context analysis, a locus termed as NS0027 between two neighboring putative neutral genes was selected and evaluated as a neutral site for genetic integration. In addition, an ethanol synthesis pathway was introduced into the NS0027 site to assess the functionality of this site. The sites we identified and the strategy we adopted in this work would benefit the development of effective genetic toolbox and efficient photosynthetic cell factories based on PCC7002.
