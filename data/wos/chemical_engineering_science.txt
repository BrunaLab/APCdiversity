AB Many correlations have been developed to predict the hydrodynamics of bubble columns. Often, these studies are performed for incomparable systems in terms of column and sparger dimensions as well as physical fluid properties. In this work, a different approach is proposed comprising interrelated correlations for liquid velocity, gas holdup and bubble size. The correlations are developed on the basis of complementary experiments with non-invasive measurement techniques, namely, Ultrafast X-ray Computed Tomography (UXCT) and Radioactive Particle Tracking (RPT). The experimental setup consists of a bubble column equipped with a needle sparger. The developed correlations consider sparger dimensions, operating conditions and bubble size. The bubble size is applied as the characteristic length in the Reynolds and the Eotvos numbers, which are utilized for the gas holdup and liquid velocity correlations. In comparison with previous approaches, the developed correlations show better agreement with experimental data from this study as well as from the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB The crystallization of potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate (potash alum) in a fluidized bed crystallizer is studied both with experiments and simulations. A population balance system with three spatial coordinates and one internal coordinate (mass) is utilized as our model. The simulations are performed with a stochastic-deterministic method with novel extensions, where the fluid dynamics of the crystallizer (flow field, temperature, concentration) are solved deterministically and the particles are simulated with a stochastic method. In experiments of 30 min duration, the average crystal diameter increases by growth and agglomeration from about 130 mu m to 210 mu m. This observation agrees qualitatively well with our simulation results. A quantitative difference between simulation and experiment leaves room for future improvements in modeling.

TI Hydrogen sulphide and VOC removal in biotrickling filters: Comparison of

AB In this paper, data is published on the removal of H2S and VOCs by a biotrickling filter (BTF) demonstration plant, namely a SULPHUS (TM), which was installed by Thames Water in late 2015. These data, along with some data already published by Sempere et al. (2018), were compared to the predictions of a number of existing and novel models for the removal of a single pollutant by a biofilm.
   The two widely used models of Ottengraf and van den Oever (1983) were found to be inadequate with sum of squares of errors of 11 and 41 mg(2) m(-6) respectively. These models are based on zero-order kinetics in the biofilm which according to the M-M kinetic model, are likely to be inaccurate at low pollutant concentration. The odour control unit was designed to produce low emission levels of less than 1 mg m(-3) of H2S, rendering the zero-order assumption unlikely to be accurate. A model based on first-order kinetics, which also has some support in the literature, was found to be a better, but not a good, fit to the data with a sum of squares of errors of 4.7 mg(2) m(-6). A novel model for the BTF based on M-M kinetics was found to be a good fit to the shape of the data with the lowest sum of squares of errors of 2.5 mg(2) m(-6). This novel M-M model was also identified as the best fit for VOC data from the same unit. Other publications support the M-M approach with a product of saturation constant and Henry's Law constant of about 50 mg m(-3), which is equivalent to an H2S level in the gas phase of about 40 ppmv. Broad agreement was found between the SULPHUS (TM) experiments and data in the literature for other BTFs destroying H2S under the zero-order regime, at V-max value of about 0.3 g/m(3)/s. This paper represents an attempt to harmonise a literature that was previously disparate, which has not previously been attempted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to visualize and quantify the interaction of two bubbles injected into an incipiently fluidized bed. The particle size, bubble sizes and the vertical and horizontal separations between bubbles were varied to understand their effects on bubble behavior. Image analysis quantified the size, shape and position of the bubbles over time. Bubbles were found to either (a) coalesce, (b) influence one another without coalescing or (c) have a collapse of a lower bubble due to influence from the upper bubble. In all cases, the lower bubbles were much more influenced in their rise by the upper bubbles than vice-versa, as lower bubbles accelerated toward the wakes of upper bubbles. Upper bubbles developed spherical cap shapes, while lower bubbles elongated vertically elongated as they rose. The experimental data provided here will serve as excellent benchmarks to challenge the assumptions made in computational and theoretical models. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The high degree of control afforded by microfluidic techniques enables the generation of monodisperse water-in-oil-in-water (W1-O-W2) double droplets, which are transformed to solid-shelled capsules through solvent-evaporation-based microencapsulation. Experimental investigations and numerical simulations are combined to explore the developments for controlled fabrication of solid-shelled capsules with designed geometry sphericity. The designed geometry sphericity arises from the competition between solidification and shear stress generated by the shear flow field. An increasing viscosity of continuous phase resists the solidification, which contributes to improve the sphericity of the solid-shelled capsules, but intensifies the shear stress of the flow filed, which promotes the deformation of the droplets. Therefore, the continuous phase viscosity exerts a parabolic effect on the deformation of double droplets and the sphericity of the resulting capsules. Accordingly, spherical and non-spherical such as oval and ellipsoid jujube core like solid-shelled capsules can be obtained by controlling the viscosity of the shear flow field.

AB In combination with computationally demanding, but steadily developing discrete particle simulation techniques, new areas of application for the fixed-bed continuum models, like in silico determination of transport parameters, become accessible. Within this study, we present a pseudo-homogeneous continuum model fully accounting for 2D fluid flow, heat and species dispersion in axial and radial direction and apply it to four configurations of packed beds. Application of different discretization techniques for fluid flow as well as heat and species transport provide an efficient and robust solution strategy. Beds of ideal spheres exhibited deviating conversion behavior due to strong oscillation in the radial flow profile. Moreover, the importance of adequate coupling of fluid flow and chemical reaction is highlighted by a variation of reaction stoichiometry. This theoretical evaluation of the continuum approach provides valuable insights on the interplay of fluid flow and chemical reaction in fixed-bed reactors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Drop breakup in high-energy emulsification is often modelled using a population balance equation (PBE) framework. For cases with high emulsifier to disperse phase concentration, the PBE is dominated by the fragmentation term. Since there are no analytical solutions to the continuous PBE for physically reasonable fragmentation rate expressions, a discretization is often needed to evaluate the PBE, turning it into a set of ordinary differential equations that can be solved numerically. The fixed pivot technique (Kumar and Ramkrishna, 1996) is one of the most often applied class discretization methods. This contribution suggests an analytical solution to the fixed pivot technique fragmentation equation, that can be used instead of the traditional numerical approach provided that the fragmentation rate is constant over time. The proposed solution compares favorably to two special cases where analytical solutions for the continuous PBE are available, and to two more realistic PBE emulsification problems (with varying fragmentation intensity and varying number of fragments formed per breakup), while offering a substantial reduction in computational time compared to the traditional approach of solving the discretized equations numerically.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents for adsorption-driven heat pumps (AHPs) due to their outstanding adsorption performance. However, the role of functionality in tuning the AHP performance has not been elucidated. In this work, the ethanol adsorption behaviors and AHP performance of Zr-based MOFs in three topologies (i.e. csq, ftw and scu) functionalized by -NH2 and -CF3 exhibiting different affinities towards ethanol working fluid were investigated by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC). It was revealed that functionalization not only affected the adsorption capacity but also shifted the steps of isotherms to the low pressure upon functionalization by -NH2. scu-MOFs exhibited the higher coefficient of performance for cooling (COPC) than csq-MOFs and ftw-MOFs. Moreover, functionalization reduced the COPC of ftw-MOFs and scu-MOFs due to the lower working capacity resulting from the reduced pore volumes. On the contrary, the COPC of csq-MOFs can be improved upon functionalization by -NH2. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Velocity distribution has a very important influence on the performance of microchannel devices. In this paper, a cutting microchannel plate was proposed, and the velocity distribution was investigated based on the resistance network method. The results showed that the asymmetric cutting microchannel plate had the most uniform velocity distribution. Finally, the optimal results were further confirmed via ANSYS Fluent simulation and the heat and mass transfer efficiencies were also investigated. Taken together, the present findings provide direct evidence that uniform velocity distribution results in the higher performance of microchannel devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Poorly specified mixtures, of which the composition is only partially known, are important in many fields. In a recent work of our group, the method NEAT for estimating activity coefficients of target components in such mixtures was introduced. In the present work, it is shown that based on a single NMR analysis of a poorly specified mixture not only the activity coefficient of the target component in that mixture but also its composition dependence can be predicted with NEAT. Hence, based on a single NMR analysis, the activity coefficient of the target component in many mixtures can be predicted with NEAT. This is possible, if the unknown part of the mixture remains unchanged, which is the case e.g. when the target component is selectively removed or when a known solvent is added or removed. The approach is successfully tested using several aqueous test mixtures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To obtain a fundamental understanding of the various factors affecting pressure filtration performance, we developed a coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) model for simulating the effect of solvent flow through the solid particle cake. The model was validated using data collected by filtering mixtures of spherical glass beads and deionized water through a dead-end cell over a range of applied pressures. Numerical experiments were performed to study the effects of particle properties, liquid properties and operating conditions on filtration performance. The model predicted that the filtrate flow rate could be strongly affected by the mean size of the particles, the presence of small particles (i.e. fines) in the particle distribution, the viscosity of the liquid, and particle deformation leading to cake compression. Our study demonstrated that CFD-DEM modeling is a powerful approach for understanding cake filtration processes and predicting filtration performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Delivery of adequate amount of anticancer drugs to tumour sites is critical to achieve effective therapeutic treatment, but it remains challenging to observe drug transport and investigate the spatial distribution of the drug in tumour microenvironment experimentally. In this study, we investigated the drug transport from a blood vessel to a tumour tissue, and explored the effect of tumour size, tumour numbers and positioning on drug concentration distribution using a numerical method in combination with a microfluidic Tumour-Vasculature-on-a-Chip (TVOC) model. The TVOC model is composed of a blood vessel channel, and a tumour channel sandwiched with a porous membrane. A species transport model based on computational fluid dynamics was adopted to investigate drug transport. The numerical simulation was firstly validated using experimental data, and then used to analyse the spatial-temporal structure of the flow, and to investigate the effect of tumour size and positioning on drug transport and drug concentration heterogeneity. We found the drug concentration surrounding the tumour was highly heterogeneous, with the most downstream point the most difficult for drugs to transport and the nearest point to the blood vessel the easiest. Moreover, tumour size and positioning contributed significantly to this drug concentration heterogeneity on tumour surface, which was dramatically augmented in large and downstream-positioned tumours. These studies established the relationship between solid tumour size/positioning and drug concentration heterogeneity in the tumour microenvironment, which could help to understand heterogeneous drug distribution in tumour microenvironment.

DE Batch reactor control; Setpoint ramp; Reactor instability; Reactor
   runaway
ID ONLINE RUNAWAY DETECTION; STABILITY-CRITERION
AB Batch reactors can present challenging dynamic control problems because of the large nonlinear changes in process parameters during the batch cycle. Large reactant concentrations at the beginning of the batch produce fast reaction rates and large heat-transfer duties if the reactor temperature is increased too rapidly from its low initial temperature. Exothermic reactions can lead to reactor runaways that exceed maximum temperature/pressure safety constraints. Several papers have studied sophisticated techniques for detecting the potential of an impending runaway and taking corrective action. A complex stability criterion embedded in a model predictive control structure is a recent suggestion for handling the problem.
   This paper discusses a simple practical technique that has been used in industry for decades. The set-point of a temperature/pressure controller is ramped up at a reasonable rate, but if the demand for coolant increases too much, the ramp is stopped until the demand for control effort drops down to a normal level.

AB This paper has established an axial meso-scale model based on the Energy-Minimization Multiscale (EMMS) principle for the gas-liquid-solid circulating fluidized bed. Comparisons made with the experimental data show that the established model is able to predict the axial hydrodynamics of the system under study. Model studies demonstrate that the dynamic formation and decomposition of the particle-clusters can illustrate the mechanism of the axial distribution. For the first time, the model predicts the transition points between the expanding fluidization mode, the circulating fluidization mode, and the liquid transporting mode. The maximum value of the solid particles' acceleration in the particle-cluster phase can be an indicator of a change to the length of the transition section. And the particle-clusters gradually form as the bubbles grow. In the pseudo steady state, the solid particles' acceleration in the liquid-solid suspension phase tends to be -9.8 m/s(2), and that of the bubbles tends to be 0 m/s(2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ferrierite zeolites have been prepared, characterized and evaluated in toluene disproportionation. The materials were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. A passivation process (chemical liquid deposition, CLD) was applied in order to modify the acidic properties of parent zeolite and the shape-selective performance in the production of p-xylene by the disproportionation of toluene. The catalyst structures and chemical compositions were characterized by SEM, XRD, XRF, TGA, DTA, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, and NH3-TPD measurements. Textural properties and acidity of ferrierite zeolites were changed by the passivation procedure. The strength and amount of acid sites on the materials diminished with increasing the modification cycles in the passivation process. In toluene disproportionation, the passivated materials were substantially more para-selective (56% at 648 K and 689.5 KPa) than the parent zeolite (H-form). Overall, the temperature and pressure ranges evaluated were from 689.5 to 2757.9 KPa and 648-698 K. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study a multi-step method was proposed to synthesize thin, high-permeable and well-oriented SAPO-34 membranes. The advantages of the different binary to quinary combinations of the available effective methods including support-masking, ionic-linkage, chemical-functionalization, dip-coating, hydrothermal and dry-gel on the structure and performance of SAPO-34 membranes in CO2/CH4 gas separation process were investigated.
   We applied for the first time, the crystallographic preferred orientation index (CPO) for comparative evaluation of proposed methods on the performance of membranes. The adsorption properties of supported membranes were also estimated and compared with those of SAPO-34 powder and of alumina support for better understanding of the effect of CPO on the mass transfer mechanism.
   It was found that the CO2 adsorption capacity is sensitive to CPO. Lower diffusion resistance, shorter diffusion path and less tortuosity were achieved at higher CPO, which made the penetration rate overcome on the absorption rate, and consequently enhanced the selectivity.

AB The co-existing natural gas and water bulk phases arise in a wide range of technological and environmental processes. The liquid-gas mixture is separated by an interface which plays a crucial role in mass transport across the phases. In this work, we use the molecular dynamics (MD) technique to investigate the molecular organization, solubility, density, and compositions of natural gas-water interfaces. We apply the NP(N)AT ensemble which is an appropriate statistical methodology to dodge the defects of the conventional ensembles in surface physics, and ultimately, to characterize the interfacial thermodynamics and mechanics. High interfacial density, excess, and radial pair distribution function of the gas components in order of propane, ethane, and methane, respectively, suggest the interfacial adsorption as per favorable interactions with a dense hydrogen bonding network near the surface in the liquid water phase. It is also found that the gas components solubility is negligible. Nevertheless, methane molecules present in natural gas can further dissolve in water, comparing to pure methane. We lastly conclude a heterogeneous formation of structure II hydrate from the adsorption and composition results. Moreover, we systematically increase the pressure from 1 MPa to 50 MPa and the temperature from 273.15 K to 303.15 K to calculate the interfacial tension using the mechanical approach. We observe a decrease in the interfacial tension along with an increase in both pressure and temperature. Given the remarkable hydrocarbon adsorption acting as a surfactant, this interfacial tension attenuation is more highlighted in a natural gas-water system compared to the pure liquid-vapor water or water-pure methane systems at the same temperature and pressure. We employ MD combined with fundamental thermodynamics to predict the interfacial tension via its independent relations with pressure and temperature which agrees with the classical scaling laws, namely, the Eotvos rule. The corresponding molecular mechanisms captured by the microscopic and macroscopic properties at the interfacial regions prospectively demonstrate a sensitivity to both temperature and pressure, which contributes to the developing understanding and applications of the imperative water-natural gas interface.

AB An efficient mathematical model is presented for conducting large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent bubbly flows at low gas hold-ups. The mathematical model is based on the filtered multi-fluid equations derived by application of the component-weighted volume-averaging process of each phase. A two-fluid model is applied to the filtered set of equations, yielding a more computationally tractable set of filtered equations. The filtered equations are formulated in generalized curvilinear coordinates to simulate turbulent gas-liquid bubbly flows in complex geometries. The Germano model is used to account for subgrid turbulent stresses. The gas and liquid momentum equations are discretized with the hybrid staggered/non-staggered method. The performance of the developed mathematical model is demonstrated by simulating the benchmark test case of a turbulent gas-liquid bubbly flow in a rectangular bubble column. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed via comparison with the experimental data and other numerical results in the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the many advantages of micro-reactors their application in industry is still limited due to their low throughput. To address this issue, micro-scale porous media are used as inserts in milli-scale tubular reactors. In this work, six different well-structured porous media (WSPM) consisting of cylindrical rods with an outer diameter of 250 mu m are characterized with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The individual WSPM differ in the rotation of rod layers around the main flow direction, and the orientation of rod layers against the flow direction. The simulation results show that changing the rod layer orientation influences the flow heterogeneity, while the rod layer rotation affects the pore alignment resulting in connected fluid paths. Scalar transport simulations reveal that the WSPM result in a considerable mixing enhancement. This study underlines the potential of integrating WSPM in milli-scale reactors as scale-up approach, and how their geometry affects mixing. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The combined ion exchange-membrane filtration system, whereby an active filtration layer is formed using a slurry flow of resin beads and water, has the potential to reduce energy usage and increase the quality of purified wastewater. The hydrodynamic design of these systems is in its infancy and there is a need for numerical methods to analyze such systems. In this work, computational fluid dynamics coupled with the discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is utilized to analyse the hydrodynamics of the combined ion exchange-membrane filtration system, and the formation of the filtrating bed and the parameters affecting it are studied by varying the flow conditions. As a result, the details of the bed formation with insights on the parameters affecting these phenomena and suggestions for an improved hydrodynamic design of the combined ion exchange-membrane filtration system are presented.

AB Dye visualisation techniques and CFD are used to characterise the flow of viscoplastic Carbopol (TM) solutions in stirred vessel systems over multiple scales. Centrally-mounted, geometrically-similar Rushton turbine (RT) impellers are used to agitate various Carbopol 980 (C980) fluids. The dimensionless cavern diameters, D-c/D, are scaled against a combination of dimensionless parameters: Re-m (-0.3)Re(y)(0.6)n (-0.1)k(s)(-1), where Re-m, Re-y, n and k(s) are the modified power-law Reynolds number, yield stress Reynolds number, flow behaviour index and impeller geometry constant, respectively. Excellent collapse of the data is demonstrated for the fluids and range of flows investigated. Additional data are collected using a pitched-blade turbine (PBT) with cavern size similarity being shown between the RT and PBT datasets. These results are important in the context of scale-up/scale-down mixing processes in stirred vessels containing complex fluids and can be used to show that flow similarity can be achieved in these systems if the processes are scaled appropriately.

AB The hydrate-former system composed of methane-propane-water was studied through HP-mu DSC and a PVT cell. New equilibrium data were obtained. Results reveal evidence of the simultaneous formation of structures I and II, although only sII is expected at such conditions at equilibrium. Most of sI is present as a metastable structure, but a small fraction of it seems to provide a more stable system, mainly at excess methane conditions. The effect of heating rate, mixing, multiple cycles and initial gas phase composition on the formation of both structures was evaluated. These factors affect the formation kinetics, the type and the proportion of each hydrate structure and hence the thermodynamic profile during dissociation. Raman spectroscopy was applied for studying ex situ single and double hydrates, suggesting a higher fraction of sII than sI for all gas phase compositions studied, and higher occupancy of large cavities by methane molecules as methane content increases.

AB We have studied the motion of a pair of unequal-sized bubbles rising inline in a quiescent liquid column, using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. In our work, a wide range of Archimedes numbers (400 < Ar < 5000) is used to study the bubbles' shape, rise-velocities, and the wake region. We found that the leading bubble is unaffected by the proximity of the trailing bubble and moves with its terminal speed, whereas, the trailing bubble shows an acceleration with an increase in its speed as it approaches the leading bubble. We have also examined the wake behaviour behind the bubbles using the pressure distribution and extracted the vortex structures using the Q-criterion. Our work has unveiled two dominant vortex structures in the wake: (1) a toroidal ring on the bubble surface near the maximum diameter plane which occasionally detaches, and (2) a set of hairpin-like structures near the rear stagnation point, which grows by diffusion. The interaction between the toroidal ring and the hairpins determine the overall wake features. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present work is concerned with the lift forces acting on particles immersed in an unbounded fluid. Both mechanisms due to rotation of the particle and vorticity of the fluid flow are considered. Focus is on solid spherical particles at Reynolds numbers up to 10(3) which are relevant for particulate flows in chemical and minerals engineering. A comprehensive review of existing results from analytical, numerical, and experimental studies is given. In particular in the simulation area many new data have appeared in the past 10 years since the earlier review of Loth [AIAA Journal 46 (2008), 801-809]. The available correlations are critically assessed by comparison to data from experiment and direct numerical simulation. Based on the comparison new correlations are proposed and gaps or inconsistencies in the data are identified. The case of wall-bounded flows will be considered in a sequel. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Here, the coalescence of similar and dissimilar droplets has been investigated in microfluidics while varying the rheological and physical properties (e.g. viscosity, density) of the fluids.
   Our data indicate that in early regimes, the dynamics of coalescence depends on the properties of the inner fluid, which can generate a dominant viscous or inertial regime, while the outer fluid controls the activation or inhibition of the merging droplets. Besides, the models describing the mechanism in vacuum or in a very low viscous outer fluid become invalid when one of those conditions fails. An accurate modification resulted from accounting for the viscosity ratio of the inner and outer fluid. A phase diagram showing the crossovers into the different possible late-time dynamics identifies that, depending on the ratio of the viscosities of the inner and outer fluid, the coalescence develops by an inertial limited viscous, pure viscous or inertial regime.

AB We show from molecular dynamics insights that the nanoporous graphene (NPG) is an efficient membrane in hydrogen purification for separating gaseous H-2/CH4 mixtures with a high permeance and selectivity. The H-2 permeance is as high as 106 GPU, extremely higher than those of polymer membranes; the selectivity of H-2 over CH4 is up to 225, in the same order with those of polymer membranes. An economic analysis is performed from the aspects of compression energy consumption and required membrane area; it is shown that the NPG membrane requires less membrane area but a bit more compression energy compared with the polymer membranes. However, the slightly higher compression energy consumption can be totally offset by the remarkably smaller membrane area. In summary, the NPG membranes for hydrogen purification present an excellent separation performance with a high H-2 permeance, ultimately resulting in an impressive economic index comparing to the polymer membranes.

TI Influence of alkali concentration, electric waveform, and frequency on

AB During the process of electro-dehydration, the electric field strength should be set below a critical value (E-crit) to inhibit droplet-interface partial coalescence. The alkali present in alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding may affect E-crit because they change the electrical properties of produced liquids. In view of this, this study investigated the effects of Na2CO3 solution concentration, electric field waveform, and frequency on the root mean square (RMS) values of E-crit. The results show that elevated Na2CO3 concentrations increase E-crit, owing to the enhanced solution conductivity which may affect the charge transfer during coalescence. The convection of ions is associated with penetration of fluid into the bulk phase and an increase in Na2CO3 concentration decreases the penetration velocity. Moreover, increasing the AC or pulsed electric field frequency can increase E-crit, and the optimal waveform (i.e., with the largest E-crit) varies with frequency. These findings will be useful for optimizing electro-coalescence systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To elucidate the motion of spatiotemporally developing flow structures driven by densely concentrated microbubbles, we experimentally investigated the distribution and motion of microbubbles rising along a vertical plane wall. We performed optical measurements and an ultrasonic velocity profiling to determine the distribution and motion of microbubbles. We found that the microbubbles form clouds (fluid blobs containing rich microbubbles) with a three-dimensional structure, the spatial patterns of which become more periodic in the streamwise direction than in the spanwise direction. In addition, owing to the coalescence of neighboring microbubble clouds caused by the hydrodynamic interaction between them, the separation length of the buoyant force distribution of microbubbles increases with increasing the distance from the bottom of the tank. According to the Reynolds number of the microbubbles cloud presented here, we conclude that the unsteady motion of microbubble clouds can be analogously modeled as an interacting motion of moving bodies in flow.

AB A novel combination consisting of microbial polysaccharide (diutan gum or xanthan gum) and branchedpreformed particle gel (B-PPG) was systematically investigated by rheological method. Polysaccharide/B-PPG suspensions exhibit pseudoplastic fluid characteristics. Synergy occurs between polysaccharides and B-PPG on thickening the suspensions. The salt tolerance is improved by combining xanthan gum and B-PPG, and both of the temperature tolerance and salt tolerance are enhanced by combining diutan gum and B-PPG. The combination of diutan gum and B-PPG contributes to the formation of strong particle gel networks based on double helices and gel particles by van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding, improving the stability in high-temperature and high-salinity environments. It was confirmed that the heavy oil recovery efficiencies of diutan/B-PPG composite (17.4% original oil in place (OOIP)) and xanthan/B-PPG composite (8.2% OOIP) were higher than that of B-PPG alone (5.3% OOIP) at 90 degrees C and 244,121 mg.L-1 salinity.

AB The coaxial mixers consisting of an inner Rushton turbine or propeller and an outer anchor were combined first with the just off-bottom suspension in viscous and high solid loading systems. In this study, a new method based on RGB brightness analysis was proposed to determine the cloud height, and the measures to promote cloud height were also discussed. In addition, the effects of rotation modes, pumping modes and solid loading on the just-suspension power were investigated. The results showed that the co-rotation coaxial mixers with an up-pumping inner impeller could achieve the just suspension at lower power consumption and were recommended. The combination of anchor and up-pumping propeller was the most energy efficient among the investigated mixers, whereas its cloud height was relatively low. The high off-bottom clearance and the combined inner impeller could promote the cloud height with little power variation, but the enlargement of inner impeller had no obvious effect.

AB The cleaning of thin toothpaste soiling layers from vertical glass surfaces by horizontal impinging water jets and the falling films created by the draining liquid were studied. The effect of soaking time on the rheological properties of the soil material, the force required to remove it, and the cleaning behaviour were determined. The adhesive removal model reported by Wilson et al. (2014, Chem. Eng. Sci., Vol. 109, 183-195) and Bhagat et al. (2017, Food Bioprod. Proc., Vol. 102, 31-54) gave a good description of the cleaning behaviour, including the shape of the cleaning front generated by jets from static and moving nozzles. This model was also applied to removal by the falling liquid film: when soaking kinetics are taken into consideration, it gives a good description of this process as well. This is the first study considering the effect of soil soaking on cleaning by water jets and falling films. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The dynamics and interfacial evolution for bubble breakup in shear-thinning non-Newtonian fluids in microfluidic T-junction were investigated. The bubble breakup process includes three stages: squeezing, transition and rapid pinch-off stages. The minimum widths of the bubble neck in three stages exhibit a power-law relationship with the time or remaining time. Compared to bubble breakup in Newtonian fluid, the squeezing stage shortens in non-Newtonian fluid, and the power-law exponent of the rapid pinch-off stage increases with the decrease of the flow index of the CMC solutions. The length of the bubble tip is linearly stretched with time, and the elongation rate increases with the concentration of CMC solution. The results show that the rheological property of the CMC solution could significantly affect the bubble breakup process in the microfluidic T-junction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, bimetallic sulfide Co8FeS8/N-C dodecahedral nanocages (DNCs) were synthesized by using ZIF-67 as a template through subsequent pyrolysis and sulfuration process. Co8FeS8 nanoparticles are embedded carbon framework, which has porous hollow interior and conductive N-doped carbon matrix. When the Co8FeS8/N-C DNCs were applied as anode materials in lithium-ion battery, the bimetallic sulfide composites realize high reversible capacity (396 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) after 400 cycles) and excellent rate capability (349 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1)). Meanwhile, Co8FeS8/N-C DNCs also have superior cycle performance (308 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1) after 1000 cycles). The remarkable properties are attributed to the synergy effect of bimetallic sulfide and the special polyhedral hollow structure with the conductive N-dopped mesoporous carbon. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We study the transport of inertial particles in water flow in porous media. Our interest lies in understanding the accumulation of particles including the possibility of clogging. We propose that accumulation can be a result of hydrodynamic effects: the tortuous paths of the porous medium generate regions of dominating strain, which favour the accumulation of particles. Numerical simulations show that essentially two accumulation regimes are identified: for low and for high flow velocities. When particles accumulate at the entrance of a pore throat (high-velocity region), a clog is formed. This significantly modifies the flow, as the partial blockage of the pore causes a local redistribution of pressure, which diverts the upstream water flow into neighbouring pores. Moreover, we show that accumulation in high velocity regions occurs in heterogeneous media, but not in homogeneous media, where we refer to homogeneity with respect to the distribution of the pore throat diameters.

AB Modeling of hydrate behaviors on the bubble surface is important for accurately evaluating the global budgets of greenhouse gas released from the deep ocean. Current mass-transfer models for hydrate shell growth mainly consider the inward and outward hydrate growth. However, the pore updating inside the hydrate shell and hydrate surface collapse may also play a significant role in hydrate growth. In this work, sustained visual observations on the morphological variation of hydrate shell on suspended methane bubbles in supersaturated water were conducted. The observed new insights and data processing results indicate that the dynamic growth of hydrate shell has successively experienced three stages: rapid development, continuous collapse and growth stagnation. Based on the surface characteristics of hydrated bubbles at different stages, a new mechanistic model of hydrate shell growth on bubble surface is developed, which considers the intercoupling of multiple hydrate-forming reactions, multiphase mass transfer processes, and hydrate collapse mechanical properties. This model not only characterizes the hydrate growth on both sides of hydrate shell, but also first presents a quantitative description of capillary pore updating inside the hydrate shell. Moreover, the relationship between the critical collapse pressure of hydrate shell and the dynamic pressure inside the hydrated bubble was investigated. Combining with experimental measurements from the literature, the efficiency of gas diffusion through the hydrate shell was determined, and correspondingly the time evolution of intergranular pore structure at different supercoolings was also performed. Using the proposed model, the variation rules of hydrate growth characterization parameters in different initial conditions were simulated and analyzed. Furthermore, the influence of the surface collapse behavior on hydrate shell thickening growth was also discussed. This work provides further insights into the growth characteristics of hydrated bubble accompanied with interphase mass transfer and surface morphological change. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID WATER ENTRY; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; SPHERE; FLOW
AB Particle impacting on a liquid surface is frequently observed in natural and industrial processes. This study numerically investigates the critical sinking behaviour after the impact of hydrophobic micron particles on liquid surfaces. The effects of contact angle theta, density ratio D, and the Reynolds number Re on the motions of the particle and TPCL are analyzed. The dimensionless penetration depth of the particle increases with increasing theta and D, whereas the effect of Re is negligible. The relationship between the TPCL position on the particles and the normalised particle displacement is only determined by theta and almost unaffected by Re and D. For the critical sinking of hydrophobic micron particles, both fluid force and surface tension play important roles in the conversion of particle kinetic energy. A dimensionless energy conservation equation is constructed, based on which a simple criterion of critical sinking is proposed. The expression of this criterion is obtained based on the semi-empirical expressions describing the relationships of each dimensionless accumulated work with Re, theta, and D obtained from simulation results. Compared with existing criteria, the proposed criterion is more accurate because it considers the fluid force, TPCL movement, and other factors reasonably. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new model for the Maxwell-Stefan (MS) diffusion coefficient was developed in this study. The entropy generation minimization principle was used to derive the expression of the MS diffusion coefficient, which has a similar form as Eyring's model. Molar excess internal energy based on two-liquid theory was derived to correct the error induced by the linear mixing rule. The local surface area fraction was used to replace the bulk fraction by considering the intermolecular friction force exerting on the molecular surfaces. The new model was applied to calculate the Fick diffusion coefficients for four binary systems, which were measured experimentally by digital holographic interferometry. Comparison of the experimental and calculation results indicated that the proposed model has a good performance for calculating the diffusion coefficients for the mentioned binary systems.

AB A spouted bed has been simulated through a Computational Fluid Dynamic model using the Two Fluid Method and validated against experimental data. A sensitivity analysis has assessed the influence of the characteristic parameters on the solution. Among them, the accurate selection of the drag law seems to have the strongest influence on the results. In order to extend the capabilities of Ansys Fluent, Di Felice's drag law was also considered through a User Defined Function. The assessment of the granular phase and its kinetic, collisional and frictional forces, is highly relevant to achieve a correct prediction of the particle velocity profile. The specularity coefficient appears to be more influencing than the restitution coefficient, but both parameters are useful to optimise the model. Overall, the prediction of the particle vertical velocity is accurate whereas the height of the fountain is slightly over-predicted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) membrane is paramount to the progress and implementation of FO process. However, typical FO membranes are confronted with many unsatisfactory issues, including the low water flux, high fouling propensity and the poor long-term operation stability in most cases, which confines the practical application of FO process to a large extent. This study proposes a feasible way to mitigate the internal concentration polarization (ICP) and optimize the polyamide (PA) layer structure of as-fabricated thin-film composite forward osmosis (TFC-FO) membranes simultaneously by incorporating phosphorylated titanium dioxide (p-TiO2) in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrate. P-TiO2 nanoparticies with abundant phosphate groups were prepared through a chemical absorption approach followed by the thermal post-treatment. Superior water flux and the better antifouling properties of the resultant PVDF/p-TiO2 TFC-FO membrane was achieved, taking advantage of the more compact and smoother PA layer as a result of the confined migration of amine monomer during interfacial polymerization (IP). In addition, effects of p-TiO2 content on morphological changes and physicochemical properties of modified substrates and the construction of top PA layer are studied and elaborated systemically via many characterizations as well as the permeation tests. As a result, the water flux decline of PVDF/p-TiO2 TFC membrane is much lower (16.0%) than that (similar to 31.3%) of the pristine TFC membrane, in the long-term (20 h) dynamic fouling test against 500 ppm humic acid (HA) solution. Therefore, PVDF/p-TiO2 TFC-FO membrane with improved water flux and low fouling tendency is beneficial for wastewater treatment and desalination process, especially for the treatment of brackish water with high fouling tendency or under harsh conditions.

AB The generation of grinding media wear during wet stirred media milling of organic particles was studied in dependence of product formulation parameters. It was shown that targeted product formulation leads to the reduction of ceramic grinding media wear for a certain product quality. Solids concentration and agglomerate size of product particles were identified as key parameters. Both influence the effective stress intensity of grinding media which has a significant impact on the generation of grinding media wear. Moreover, the reduction of grinding media wear can be attributed to the damping properties of comparatively soft organic particles. Their potential to protect ceramic grinding media from abrasion can be increased by tailoring formulation properties. Therefore, especially the increase of solids concentration was identified as most practical formulation variable which affects also grinding efficiency and production capacity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the present study, the performance of water based-nanofluids containing four different types of carbon nanostructures for solar vapor generation has experimentally been investigated. The considered nanofluids are multi-walled carbon nanotube, single-walled carbon nanotube, graphene nanoplate and graphene oxide. Nanofluids with three nanoparticle mass concentrations of 0.001%, 0.002%, and 0.004% were prepared and their evaporation characteristics were investigated for solar radiation intensities in the range of 1.5 and 3.5 Suns. The results indicated that the multi-walled carbon nanotube nanofluid with a mass concentration of 0.004% provides the highest evaporation rate with the maximum total efficiency of 94% at 3.5 Suns. The total efficiencies for nanofluids containing the single-walled carbon nanotube, graphene nanoplate and graphene oxide at similar conditions and that of pure water, respectively, are about 91%, 90%, 81% and, 54%. Furthermore, it is observed that for the mass concentration of 0.004%, the evaporation rate with respect to water increases to about 72%, 63%, 58% and 36%, respectively, for the multi-walled carbon nanotube, the single-walled carbon nanotube, graphene nanoplate and graphene oxide nanofluids. As far as the sensible heat is concerned, graphene oxide shows the most considerable sensible heating efficiency at the mass concentration of 0.004% with the maximum fluid bulk temperature rise of 20.5 degrees C, which is 40% higher than that of water. Finally, it was found that increasing the radiation intensity from 1.5 to 3.5 Suns improves the evaporation rate; however, the sensible heat efficiency is more influenced such that the evaporation efficiency declines. The quality of the produced water from a seawater sample is also examined and it was shown that it is well below the limitations of the drinking water standards. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The market is overflooded by unrefined glycerol with the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils. A recurrently studied alternative for its valorization is the production of acetins via esterification with acetic acid over acid catalysts in liquid phase. However, most of the published literature uses experimental methodologies that prevent a proper kinetic analysis of the reaction. This work revisits glycerol esterification with acetic acid catalyzed by Amberlyst-35 applying sequential statistically designed experiments. Following such approach, statistically meaningful data were collected providing insight into the catalytic reaction. Experiments were designed to test the influence of the quantity of active sites; assumed herein as the number of surface SO3H+ sites on Amberlyst-35, temperature, and the acetic acid to glycerol molar ratio over the turnover frequency of the catalyst. The collected evidence shows that, under the typical conditions employed in most open literature, heat and mass transport artifacts should not be neglected. In the present case, these limitations were overcome by reducing the particle size of the solid. Under such conditions, a straightforward relationship between the concentration of surface SO3H+ active sites and the glycerol turnover rates was established. Meanwhile, it was shown that the reaction temperature has a rather weak effect on the catalytic turnover. This trend concurred with the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction. Likewise, the already established effect of the acetic acid to glycerol molar ratio was also confirmed. Overall, the performed study serves a double purpose. First, it is a methodological guide to collect kinetically relevant information in liquid phase. Second, it reports intrinsic kinetic rates for the esterification reaction over the studied catalyst hence paving the way for a rigorous kinetic modeling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study of heat exchangers with both the hot and cold fluid sides driven by buoyancy forces is an area of considerable interest due to their inherent passivity and non-existence of moving parts. The current study aims to study such heat exchange devices employing the basic Coupled Natural Circulation Loop (CNCL) systems. A one dimensional (1-D) Fourier series based semi-analytical model of the basic CNCL system is proposed. A 3-D CFD validation is performed to validate the developed 1-D model. The non-dimensional numbers such as Grashof number, Fourier number, Stanton number and Reynolds number, which determine the system behavior are identified and a detailed parametric study is performed. Both vertical and horizontal CNCL systems are considered along with the parallel and counter flow configurations. The heater-cooler location greatly influences the behavior of CNCL system. The vertical CNCL always exhibits counter flow configuration whereas the horizontal CNCL system may exhibit parallel or counter flow arrangement depending on the heater-cooler location and initial flow conditions.

AB A model is presented for photocuring of a hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) film, where in the presence of oxygen liquid monomer cures into a solid polymer network. The model is based on an earlier version (ledema et al., 2018) that has been validated in absence of oxygen. The oxygen from ambient air inhibits the polymerization in the top part of the film causing conversion gradients across the film, which is a problem in the manufacture of large scale prints. In the current work results of the curing of thin HDDA films (10 mu m) exposed to ambient air with initiator Irgacure 819, bis(acylphosphine oxide) under irradiation intensity varying in a range of 1000-6000 W.m(2) are presented. The average conversion of vinyl groups in bulk of the films was registered by real-time Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) in transmission mode, while simultaneously the conversion in the non-exposed bottom part was measured by real-time FTIR with attenuated transmission reflectance (ATR). The bulk data were used to estimate the kinetic and transport parameters of the model, which enables it to correctly describe the bulk and bottom cure as measured by FTIR. The model accounts for local swelling and shrinking of the created polymer due to the conversion gradient. By Raman spectroscopy the conversion gradient after the photocuring process was also directly measured, again confirming the considerable conversion difference between top and bottom of the film predicted by the model as caused by oxygen inhibition. Initially dissolved small amounts oxygen throughout the whole film turns out to be a negligable role. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is concerned with a numerical study on the behavior of a single Newtonian droplet suspended in another Newtonian fluid, all subjected to a simple shear flow. Conservative finite-volume approximation on a collocated three-dimensional grid along with a conservative Level-set method are used to solve the governing equations. Four parameters of capillary number (Ca), Viscosity ratio (lambda), Reynolds number (Re) and walls confinement ratio are used to physically define the problem. The main focus of the current study is to investigate the effect of viscosity on walls critical confinement ratio. In this paper, the phrase critical is used to specify a state of governing parameters in which divides the parameter space into the subcritical and supercritical regions where droplets attain a steady shape or breakup, respectively. To do so, first, we validate the ability of proposed method on capturing the physics of droplet deformation including: steady-state subcritical deformation of non-confined droplet, breakup of supercritical conditioned droplet, steady-state deformation of moderate confined droplet, subcritical oscillation of highlyconfined droplet, and the effect of viscosity ratio on deformation of the droplet. The extracted results are compared with available experimental, analytical and numerical data from the literature. Afterward, for a constant capillary number of 0.3 and a low Reynolds number of 1.0, subcritical (steady-state) and supercritical (breakup) deformations of the droplet for a wide range of walls confinement in different viscosity ratios are studied. The results indicate the existence of two steady-state regions in a viscosity ratio-walls confinement ratio graph which are separated by a breakup region. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A Discrete Phase Model (DPM) is adopted to investigate the particle behavior during viscosity measurement of solid-bearing slags. The particle-particle interaction is interpreted by the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The results show that the particle migration is a function of shear time, leading to continuous changes in variable viscosity before a critical shear time. The critical shear time and therefore the viscosity measurement depend on the operational conditions through the particle migration behavior that is influenced by the shear time, rotational speed, gap width and particle content, shape and size. The study of particle size indicates a size segregation of the initially homogeneous system. Based on our results a number of guidelines are formulated to assist in developing more reproducible viscosity measurement methodologies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Micro-reactors, enabling continuous processes at small scales, have been of growing interest due to their advantages over batch. These advantages include better scaling, as well as improved mass and heat transfer, though many new challenges arise due to the small scales involved such as non-negligible entrance effects and significant pressure losses. The flow in coils, rectangular channel serpentine plates, mix-andreside plates, and liquid-liquid (LL) mixing plates was investigated and characterized using residence time distribution (RTD) tests. A pulse test was used to determine the RTD curve of these reactors at flowrates ranging from 15 to 100 g/min of water. A semi-empirical, multi-parameter model was used to describe the asymmetrical curves, while the axial dispersion model was used to describe the symmetrical ones. The Peclet number is given in function of the Reynolds number for the LL plates that were found to be near-plug flow (Pe > 100). In a plate with continuous LL micro-mixers, the Pe ranged from 193 to 467 with Pe increasing as Re increased. Importantly, the effect of straight channel segments interspaced between mixers is also evaluated as a method of volume gain for scale-up of micro-reactors. For a given average energy dissipation rate, the Pe number was maintained for the shorter channel segments between LL micro-mixers whereas longer spacing lengths likely lead to the development of unidirectional laminar flow and resulting in the observed increased axial dispersion and tailing in the RTD.

AB Minimum fluidization velocity of binary mixtures is one of the most important parameters when applying an Air Dense Medium Fluidized Bed for dry coal beneficiation. Measurements of minimum fluidization velocities were carried out for binary mixtures of magnetite and sand/gangue/coal particles. The experimental results showed that the minimum fluidization velocity of binary mixtures remained almost unchanged when the volume fraction of magnetite particles was above 50%, whereas it varied significantly when the volume fraction of magnetite particles was below 50%. A general correlation based on the Cheung equation has been developed for predicting the minimum fluidization velocity of binary mixtures in terms of particle size ratio, volumetric composition and incipient fluidization velocity of each component. The extended Cheung equation is in reasonable agreement with almost all the available experimental data in the present work and the literature, and it can be used to estimate accurately the minimum fluidization velocity of binary mixtures of medium particles for the ADMFB and other similar fluidized bed operations.

AB Endothermic hydrocarbon fuel (EHF) is used as on-board coolant quenching the combustors of advanced aircrafts through sensible and endothermic pyrolysis reactions. The supercritical pyrolysis of EHFs was experimentally investigated under conditions (3.5 MPa, 525-600 degrees C) in a stainless steel mini-tubular reactor heated by a fluidized sand bath system. A simplified molecular reaction kinetic model (16 species and 11 reactions) was proposed based on the primary/secondary pyrolysis mechanism and the residence time estimation using computational fluid dynamics simulations. The experimental and predicted results using the developed kinetics model agree very well with the errors less than 10% under the conversion up to 70%. The pyrolysis model was also used in modeling EHF flowing and pyrolysis in an electrically heated tube showing the conversion prediction errors less than 15% and the fuel and wall temperature prediction deviations less than 20 K, which is a significant improvement on the previous model (Energy Fuels 2013, 27, 2563).

AB We present a two-phase thermal-hydrologic-chemical coupled model for simulating the dissolution process during the acidization of carbonate rocks. In particular, we develop a new model to describe the change in irreducible water saturation, residual oil saturation, and the maximum relative permeability of oil and water phases with dissolution proceeding. We also present a new method for the generation of the initial porosity field with controllable correlation length. In numerical calculation, the sequential iteration approach is adopted to solve the presented model, and the operator splitting method is used to deal with the reaction relevant equations. The involved equations are discretized using the finite-volume method, where the convection term is discretized by the MINMOD scheme which can prevent overshoot/undershoot of the numerical solution. Additionally, sensitivity analysis of the dissolution process concerning rock properties, the exothermic heat of reaction, and two-phase flow, is carried out. Based on the predicted results, several recommendations for the carbonate acidizing operation are given, and the potential extensions of the current work are summarized. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fe2O3 nanoparticles is confined in the mesoporous shell of N-doped carbon microsphere for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A series of hollow catalysts together with corresponding control samples have been constructed, characterized and evaluated. The structure, composition and state of the as-prepared catalysts were characterized by Scanning electron microscope, Transmission electron microscope, X-Ray diffraction, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The electrochemical activity and selectivity of Fe2O3-based catalyst toward the 4e pathway has been greatly improved (E-onset of -50 mV, E-1/2 of -150 mV and average electron transfer number of 3.87). The current density is 18.5% higher than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the confinement of Fe2O3 nanoparticles in the interlayer of N-doped graphite can significantly promote the activity of N-doped graphitic surface in alkaline media for ORR, due to facilitated O-2 adsorption and reduced energy of OOH formation which is the rate-determining step of ORR. Such a confinement strategy provides a general and effective route to push the limit of transition metal oxides to a higher level for ORR and realize the controllable construction of highly active non-noble-metal catalysts with well-defined mechanism understanding.

AB In this work, two new polymorphs (monohydrate and ethanol solvate) of lansoprazole were first discovered and fully characterized. The transformation between two polymorphs of lansoprazole was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The ternary phase diagram of the two polymorphic forms of lansoprazole in the binary solvent mixtures of ethanol and water at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C was determined and the thermodynamic model was established. Raman spectroscopy was used to in situ monitor the solvent-mediated transformation from monohydrate to ethanol solvate of lansoprazole, while the solution concentration was measured by UV spectroscopy. The population balance models were established to analyze and compare the dissolution, nucleation and crystal growth process during polymorphic transformation. By combining the experimental and simulation results, the rate-controlling step, the changing profiles of the suspension density and the solid compositions of both polymorphs were investigated and discussed. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on the transformation process was also analyzed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID BARIUM-SULFATE PRECIPITATION; SCALE-UP; SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; QUALITY;
   GROWTH
AB A zone model for the semi-batch precipitation process of sparingly soluble salts in stirred-tank reactors is presented. The low product solubility of these substances leads to high levels of supersaturation during the process. Consequently, nucleation and growth rates are fast and solids formation only takes place in a part of the reactor close to the feed pipe. The presented local mixing environment (LME) model extends an existing model for semi-batch processes, which consists of two zones. In the mixing zone, a steady-state plug-flow reactor (PFR) is used to imitate the local flow environment of the feed. The tank is approximated as a well-mixed storage tank outside the mixing zone. Exchange streams between the two zones are estimated by dimensional analysis considering stirrer type, size and rotational speed. The correctness of the two-zone hypothesis and the accuracy of the LME model is validated by barium sulfate precipitation in an experimental comparison setup using different stirrer types, rotational speeds and feed rates. The PFR is represented in the experiments as a pipe-in-pipe reactor in jet-in-cross-flow (JICF) or coaxial-flow (COAX) arrangement. The experimental results show that the semi-batch precipitation of sparingly soluble salts in stirred-tanks can be successfully simplified by the assumption of a PFR mixing zone. The LME model is simple to implement, scalable and reaches acceptable results in the experimental validation. It is therefore a promising model for future application in process simulation of industrial precipitation processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aryl ketones are ubiquitous structural motifs in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, the traditional methods for their generation are often costly and not environment-friendly. Herein we report a novel and efficient route for the preparation of aryl ketones by photocatalysis at mild conditions. Porous C3N4 nanorods decorated with spatially separated Ag and Co3O4 nanoparticles on the interior and exterior surface of C(3)N(4)( )hollow sphere (Co3O4/Ag@C3N4) fabricated by a facile method of supramolecular self-assembly. Using this porous material as photocatalyst and O-2 as oxidant, aryl ketones could efficiently generate (with a yield up to 75.7% and selectivity to 97%) via toluene and halobenzene under visible-light irradiation at room temperature. The present study not only provides an inexpensive strategy for aryl ketones generation but also an effective tactic for activation of sp(3 )C-H bonds under mild conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effective diffusivity and the effective Thiele modulus of reactive porous matrices are determined by using a hybrid discrete and continuum model. The model describes static heterogeneity with weak noise on both morphology and topology of the matrix. Variations in diffusivity with respect to pore size (radius and length) and network connectivity up to second order are analyzed to assess the effect of stochastic media on catalytic reaction and transition of a single species. The porous medium is simulated by several building blocks (BB) which are regular in topology and morphology. A methodology is presented to construct a BB such that it fits the true matrix. Permutation of several regular pore networks in series constructs the porous media. Local mass balances over each BB yields model equations for reaction and transport in the matrix. Correlated random walk theory is used in each BB in order to relate the diffusivity to the coordination number.
   The Gaussian correlation function is assumed to model the autocorrelation of independent variables which are used to characterize the correlated porous media. The contribution of the fluctuating parameters in the mass conservation of the matrix yields a new closure equation in which ensemble average concentration of the reactant depends on different cross-correlations. The model is stable as long as the Thiele modulus at the correlation length scale is small. It predicts that geometrical heterogeneities lead to correction in effective diffusivity while the reaction rate is unaffected due to small Thiele modulus at correlation length scale. The model is verified by assessing the Thiele modulus of a pore network under Knudsen regime during a first order catalytic reaction; a good agreement was found especially for moderate Thiele modulus of correlated network. However, it fails to simulate random networks. Our systematic study revealed that the pore radius statistics impact significantly the diffusivity and the Thiele modulus while the topological parameters are important in weakly connected networks. The model predictions show that the diffusion constant decreases sharply as pore radius variance increases but increases smoothly with Thiele modulus. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vinyl lactam-based polymers have been shown to be excellent kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs), inhibiting the formation and growth of methane hydrate under low subcooling conditions. However, under moderate/high subcooling conditions, they lose their inhibitory effect and can even be converted into hydrate promoters. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to explore the invalidation mechanism of two vinyl lactam-based KHIs, namely, PVP-A and PVP, under high subcooling conditions. By analyzing the nucleation and growth trajectories of methane hydrate in the absence/presence of KHIs, we found that the addition of KHIs could shorten the nucleation time of methane hydrate by reducing the mass transfer resistance of methane and water molecules and accelerating the formation of the hydrate precursor.

TI How coherent structures dominate the residence time in a bubble wake: An
   experimental example

DE Bubble wake; Local residence time; Lagrangian coherent structures;
   Competitive consecutive reaction; Reaction timescale
ID MASS-TRANSFER; ENCOUNTER VOLUME; SIMULATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Timescales and residence times in reactive multiphase flows are essential for product selectivity. For instance when a gas species is consumed, e.g., by a competitive consecutive reaction with moderate reaction kinetics where reaction timescales are comparable to relevant mixing timescales. To point out the importance of the details of the fluid flow, we analyze experimental velocity data from a Taylor bubble wake by means of Lagrangian methods. By adjusting the channel diameter in which the Taylor bubble rises, and thus the rise velocity, we obtain three different wake regimes. Remarkably, the residence times of passive particles advected in the bubble wake's velocity field show a peak for intermediate rise velocities. This observation seems unintuitive at first glance because one expects a faster removal of passive tracers for a faster overall flow rate. However, the details of the flow topology analyzed using Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields and Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) reveal the existence of a coherent vortical pattern in the bubble wake which explains the long residence times. The increased residence times within the vortical structure in combination with the close bubble interface acting as a constant gas species source could enhance side product generation of a hypothetical competitive consecutive reaction, where the first reaction with the gas species forms the desired product and the second the side product.

AB We propose a three-dimensional time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to investigate the freezing/melting of Lennard-Jones fluids in interfacial systems including flat interfaces and nano-droplets. The theory is based on a modified fundamental measure theory (MFMT) for the hard-sphere reference system plus mean field theory (MFT) for the attractive contributions plus an additional weighted density approximation (WDA) contribution to enforce that bulk liquid equation of state is that of modified Benedict, Webb and Rubin (MBWR). By using different initial states, our theory generated a series of equilibrium structures including crystals and polyhedral particles. The non-linear effect and the irreversibility of the freezing/melting process were captured. The profiles for free energy and the order parameter indicate that the free energy barrier existing in the freezing/melting process is caused by the break in symmetry. Additionally, the time-dependent properties were also examined, and provided insight into the mechanism of the freezing process. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, various nanothermites, such as nCuO/nano Al (nAl), nMoO(3)/nAl, nBi(2)O(3)/nAl, nFe(2)O(3) /nAl, nNiO/nAl and nMgO/nAl, were encapsulated into ammonium perchlorate (AP) by the evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) method. The obtained composites showed superior properties in decreasing the decomposition temperature of AP, increasing heat of release and ignition and combustion properties than the corresponding physically-mixed ones. The mechanism for such high-quality composites prepared by EISA was due to not only more intimate interaction between AP and nanothermites but also less agglomeration of nanothermites. nAl/nCuO/AP showed the lowest decomposition temperature of AP, highest heat of release and best ignition and combustion properties among all the obtained composites by EISA. This was because of effective conversion of NH3 to N2O with less NO production, as proved by the real-time FT-IR. This work demonstrated that EISA was an effective approach with high compatibility for obtaining various AP-nanothermites-based energetic materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To benchmark the performance of a different of catalytic materials it is essential to know the adsorption characteristics such as the kinetic order of adsorption, the apparent rate constant and the total number of active sites. It is advantageous to normalize the reaction rate to the number of active sites; a quantity commonly referred to as the turnover frequency (TOF). Methods such as chemisorption and SSITKA (steady state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) are conventionally used to quantify the number of active sites, both have advantages and drawbacks. The TAP (Temporal Analysis of Products) pulse response technique provides a distinct method for precise (10 nmol) quantification of active sites at elevated temperatures. Using irreversible reaction processes, mathematical techniques for analysis of pulsed active site titration are described herein. Whereas previous methods simply consider the total capacity for gas adsorption, these new methods take into account the dynamics and interdependence of the conversion, the number of available sites and the adsorption rate as they change over the course of the titration experiment. Moreover, these methods enable an independent fitting of the kinetic order and stoichiometry of the adsorption process directly from experimental data. In comparison with experimental data for the incremental oxidation of a reduced platinum, we found the analytical method of linear rectification was most robust and efficient. In fitting the kinetic order to experimental data collected between 125 and 175 degrees C we found a clear indication over the range of 45-95% conversion of a second order rate dependence and 2:1 balance between active sites and O-2.

AB An ionic liquid (IL)-based Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction was implemented successfully in a droplet-based microreactor. FC-40 fluorocarbon-based liquid was introduced as the continuous phase to disperse reactants into uniform droplets. The negligible effect of the existence of FC-40 on reaction and product analysis was clarified, and then the reaction performance within droplets was investigated under different operating conditions. The application of droplet-based microreactor not only solved the clogging problem in a microchannel due to high viscosity of ionic liquids, but also improved the reaction yield by intensifying mixing. Compared with a batch reactor, the yield in the droplet-based microreactor improved evidently, i.e., from 59.4% to 68.7% at 83 degrees C with the reaction time at 10 min. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Polydisperse gas-solid systems are more common in both industry and the natural world than their monodisperse counterparts. This paper aims to investigate the hydrodynamics of polydisperse gas-solid flow systems by extending the energy minimization multiscale (EMMS) drag model. The continuous particle size is discretized into several characteristic sizes, by which the polydisperse particles are classified into several discrete groups. A polydisperse EMMS drag model is then developed by treating these particle groups as solid phases. Finally, the proposed drag model is coupled with the multifluid model to simulate the hydrodynamics of polydisperse gas-solid flow in CFB risers. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the polydisperse EMMS drag model and investigate the effects of gas-particle drag models, kinetic theories, and particle-particle drag models on the simulation results. It was found that (i) the polydisperse EMMS drag model can predict the concentration and particle size distribution of polydisperse gas-solid flows better than the traditional drag model; (ii) the particle-particle drag force has an important influence on the mixing and segregation of different particles whereas the particulate phase stress has only a very minor effect, especially when the superficial gas velocity is low. The second finding highlights the need for a suitable particle-particle drag model that considers the effects of mesoscale structures, which will be the topic of our future study.

AB Filtered Two Fluid Models (fTFMs) aim to enable accurate industrial-scale simulations of fluidized beds by means of closures accounting for the effects of bubbles and clusters. The present study aims to improve anisotropic closures for the drift velocity, which is the primary sub-grid effect altering the filtered drag force, by deriving increasingly complex closures by considering additional independent variables (markers). Three different anisotropic closures, as well as an isotropic closure, are evaluated. A priori tests revealed a significant increase in the predictive capability of the closures as the complexity, in terms of the number of markers considered, increases. However, this improvement is relatively small when compared to the effect of considering anisotropy. Next, a posteriori tests were completed by comparing coarse-grid simulations of bubbling, turbulent and core-annular fluidization against benchmark resolved TFM simulations. This analysis shows good performance of all anisotropic closures, with negligible to minor effects of increasing the drag closure's complexity by considering additional markers. On the other hand, the isotropic closure lacks generality and shows poor grid independence behaviour. It is therefore concluded that it is essential to include important physical effects, such as anisotropy, in fTFM closures, while complexity in terms of the number of markers considered is of lesser importance.

AB Successful scale-up of biological fermentations requires the prevention of any performance losses from lab to production scale. Modelling large-scale conditions, in particular, so-called lifeline analysis, is a proper approach to unravel potential risks and to guide the way for preventing non-wanted underperformance. This study focuses on synthesis gas fermentations in bubble columns which are particularly challenging because of poor carbon (C) -source solubility and low bacterial energy availability under such anaerobic conditions. As a model case, Clostridium ljungdahlii DSM 13528 is studied in a 125 m(3) bubble column reactor investigating bacterial motion patterns, circulation time, short- and long-term responses. A pseudo-stationary gas gradient respectively fermentations 'snap-shot' was conducted with computational fluid dynamics in an Euler-Euler approach while the movement of the microorganism was simulated as Lagrangian massless particles. Cells were assigned uptake and product formation kinetics. Statistical lifeline analysis revealed that 97% of all cells experienced substrate limitations, whereas 84% were likely to undergo transcriptional changes after exposure in stress-inducing zone longer than 70 s. Bacteria movements predominately occurred between low and moderate product biomass yield regions with longer residence times in the latter. The circulation time derived from mixing time analysis is similar to the mean circulation time of a single bacterium. The latter was deduced from regime transition studies. Maximum residence times over 100 s as minimum regime crossing times of 10 s could also be identified. These findings show the high potential of Lagrange trajectories analysis in bubble column gas gradients which can be used for performance prediction and therefore risk minimization in scale-up.

AB A systematical method is proposed for integrating the reaction and separation system and automatically identifying the optimal distillation sequence. Based on the regularity of each component as a non-key component, the non-key component matrix is constructed to illustrate the difference between distillation sequences. With the marginal minimum vapor rate of non-key components used to evaluate distillation sequences and the relation between reactor and distillation sequences considered, procedure is developed for automatically identifying the optimal distillation sequence and reactor parameters. The proposed method can be used for systems with simple columns performing sharp splits and the separated mixture can be taken as ideal mixtures. The reaction and distillation systems of the propylene oxide production process and styrene production process are analyzed, and the optimal distillation sequences generated by the proposed method are in good agreement with that identified by the systematical analyzation and rigorous simulation.

AB Synthesizing high performance jet fuel from biomass provides potential way to convert low-cost biomass to valuable fuels and meets the requirements of sustainable development. Here, we report a one-pot synthesis of high density and low freezing point jet-fuel-ranged blending from bio-derived phenol and cyclopentanol, which is with high yield, simple and low-cost for scale-up. With the co-presence of acid catalyst like H beta and metal catlayst like Pd/C, the alkylation first happens to produce bi-and tri-cyclic compounds under N-2 atomphere, then in H-2 atmosphere the remained reactant is partly hydrogenated and takes part in alkylation again to produce cyclic compounds, finally hydrodeoxygenation happens to convert all the compounds to cyclic hydrocarbons. A jet-fuel-blending containing bi- and tri-cyclic alkanes is obtained at high molar yield of 83.9% from the starting reactant, which shows high density of 0.89 g/mL, freezing point lower than -75 degrees C. Especially, the major component, i.e. cyclopentylcyclohexane shows much better low-temperature properties compared with reported hydrocarbons with similar molecular structure. This result provides a simple, low-cost way to synthesize high performance jet fuel from biomass. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vapor permeation seems to be a more suitable separation process than pervaporation in bio-ethanol recovery from fermentation broth because of its non-direct contact trait. The unsatisfactory flux and selectivity of polymeric membranes limit their utilization in industrial application. Here, we tailored the physical and chemical structure of commercial available polyacrylonitrile (PAN) ultrafiltration membrane to serve in vapor permeation. The membrane porosity was reduced till dense enough for separation while preserving an ultra-high flux by hydrolyzing in alkali. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity was controlled by grafting fluoroalkyl chains to ensure an acceptable ethanol selectivity. The changes of physical structure and chemical property were systematically characterized by Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle and pure water permeance. Tested at 60 degrees C, the optimized membrane exhibited a high flux of ca. 10.5 kg m(-2) h(-1) and a permeate ethanol content similar to vapor-liquid equilibrium curve, which outstripped most polymeric membranes (applied in pervaporation or vapor permeation) in both flux and selectivity.

AB Understanding the diffusion and permeation behavior of shale gas at geological depths is significantly important to exploration of shale gas, while the permeation mechanism of shale gas in shale gas reservoir is closely related to the confined fluid behavior at mesoscopic scale and cannot be described by traditional Fick or Knudsen diffusion models. In this work, we use the dual control volume grand canonical molecular dynamics method to systematically investigate the permeation processes of shale gas in cylindrical -like kerogen pores represented by the carbon nanotube at different geological depths, and hundreds of simulation data in different pressures, temperatures and pore diameter are obtained. By analyzing these simulated data, we propose a new permeation model to describe the permeability of shale gas in cylindrical-like kerogen pores at geological depths. The new model can satisfactorily reproduce the extrapolation testing data of permeability of shale gas, and perfectly bridge the gap between macroscopic Fick model and microscopic Knudsen model, which provides a useful guidance and reference for exploration of shale gas.

AB Quantifying pressure drop for fluids passing through woven screen meshes has been the subject of numerous investigations. All of them rely on one of two major theories that explain the pressure losses in terms of a conceptualized nature of the flow. This paper attempts to compare the two approaches using a large number of new experimental measurements conducted using water flowing through circular conduits in which equidistant woven meshes are inserted. The work was also compared against a large number of measurements extracted from the open literature and obtained using single gauzes and/or tightly packed gauzes.
   In contrast to earlier works that focused on narrow ranges of Re and/or accurately predicting their respective experimental measurements, this investigation considers, in total, a set of more than a thousand data points. Two universal correlations, each corresponding to a different theory, were derived using data that spans 60 different screen geometries with fraction open areas ranging between 0.21 and 0.84. These correlations were found to predict the pressure drop over a wide range of Reynolds numbers at an acceptable accuracy. Furthermore, it was found that both theoretical approaches render similar outputs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A model describing NH3 selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) over Cu-ZSM-5 to investigate the effects of intraphase and interphase mass transfer on standard SCR reaction is developed and further verified with the synthetic gas bench. The correlation between tortuosity and porosity has been analyzed by least squares method and applied to the sinuousoidal capillary bundle model. The effects of washcoat thicknesses, lengths, cell densities and channel widths on the standard SCR reaction are analyzed in temperature range of 150-500 degrees C. It is found that deNOx efficiency is affected by intraphase diffusion limitations at 200-500 degrees C and by interphase mass transfer limitation at intermediate (250-400 degrees C) and high temperatures (400-500 degrees C). As the temperature increases, the reaction is firstly controlled by kinetics, with the kinetics resistance decreasing and then increasing until the maximum among three processes. Furthermore, intake flow rates (GHSVs) play an important role impacting NO conversion on NH3-SCR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Heat transfer is studied in a lab-scale tubular reactor packed with spherical 0.5-1 mm iron-manganese oxide particles with an Fe/Mn molar ratio of 2:1. A two-dimensional transient heat transfer model considering conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer is developed to simulate the temperature profile in the reactor. The effective thermal conductivity of the packed bed as well as the wall heat transfer coefficient are determined based on the experimental data and a steady-state model. The validity of calculated effective parameters is checked by employing the parameters in a transient model and comparing the predicted temperature profile with transient experimental data and by comparison with existing correlations found in the literature.

AB Six different surfaces ranging from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic were fabricated. Droplet impact experiments were conducted on these surfaces with water droplets 2.25 mm in diameter at a Weber number close to zero to study the effects of surface wettability on the impact process and postimpact oscillation. Droplet impact on all surfaces, except for superhydrophobic surfaces, is dominated by a spreading stage and no evident retraction is observed. Using the inertia-capillarity time t(c) = root rho R-0(3)/sigma as characteristic time, the spreading stage on all surfaces at We < 0.5 was calculated to be 2.25 +/- 0.11t(c); further, it could be divided into inertial and viscous spreading stages at 1 +/- 0.11t(c) based on droplet height evolution. A semi-empirical correlation for calculating the evolution of spreading factors on different surfaces was fitted by a piecewise exponential function using experimental data, and a deviation of +/- 20% was observed between the fitted and experimental data.

AB The relationship between power and flow characteristics of batch rotor-stator mixers has been studied using CFD simulations with experimental power validation. The mixer studied was the Silverson L5M batch mixer with the standard emulsor head. The size of the holes in the screen and the constriction of the base hole were changed in small increments. The MRF technique was used to model rotor rotation. A model is developed in this study which links the power and flow numbers of the mixer. Since power is easy to measure experimentally, one can use this model to predict the flow number by measuring torque. A second model is also developed which allows one to predict the flow number using solely the geometry of the mixing head. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the relationship between power, flow and mixer geometry in rotor-stator mixers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of abundant solar energy to produce clean water by a solar steam generation device is a promising strategy to solve the long-term water and energy shortage. The development and application of photothermal materials are an effective way to improve solar photothermal conversion efficiency of the device. Herein, an inorganic-organic light-absorbing material, copper sulfide-macroporous polyacrylamide hydrogel (CuS-m-PAM), is reported for the first time. The CuS-m-PAM was prepared by in-situ synthesis method via loading CuS nanoparticles into macroporous polyacrylamide hydrogel (m-PAM). CuS-m-PAM forms a heating zone at the air-water interface and CuS nanoparticles can efficiently convert the strongly absorbed light into localized heat, thus reducing the heat loss in the transfer process. The results demonstrate that the solar photothermal conversion efficiency of CuS-m-PAM-0.05 is the highest and can reach 92% under one sun illumination (1000 W m(-2)). The rough surface of m-PAM and the plasma resonance effect of CuS nanoparticles improve the absorb ability to sunlight. The open macroporous structure of m-PAM also makes a great contribution to the water vapor escape of solar steam generation device. Moreover, the formation of N-Cu bond in CuS-m-PAM makes CuS nanoparticles more stabilization, and the solar photothermal conversion efficiency of CuS-m-PAM-0.05 remains 87.5% after 50 cycles of tests. CuS-m-PAM, as a novel light-absorbing material, can comprehensively optimize the solar steam generation device in light absorption, thermal insulation, water replenishment and steam exhaust, and thus provides a new practical method for maximum utilization of solar steam generation device.

AB The prediction of the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic behavior from the characteristics of post impinged droplet on a surface with the alteration of physical properties of fluid or the surface properties has gained much interest for the development of anti-fogging glass, gradient surface and anti-corrosion surfaces. The abovementioned characteristics are well described by the spreading, recoiling, rolling, and bouncing behaviors of the post impinged droplet and these phenomena are controlled by viscous and capillary forces. The proper combination of the capillary and viscous forces of a fluid leads to various levels of recoiling and spreading. However, in terms of the discussed forces, the conditions to attain superhydrophobicity/superhydrophilicity are not reported. Therefore, in the current work, an attempt has been made to predict critical conditions for the attainment of both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic characteristics in terms of fluid and surface properties defining the post impingement behavior. The analysis of droplet dynamics reveals that the ratio of viscous force to capillary force (V-F/C-F) is considered as the defining parameters for super-hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics. For the attainment of superhydrophilic characteristics, V-F/C- (F) ratio must be greater than 30 x 10(-4) and value below 2.9 x 10(-4) generates superhydrophobicity. Furthermore, the role of viscosity and surface tension in droplet dynamics were also investigated by using Central Composite Design (CCD) analysis methodology and it confirms the existence of strong interaction between the viscosity and surface tension.

AB Based on the bench-scale opposed multi-burner (OMB) impinging entrained-flow gasifier and advanced visualization apparatus, studies on the coal water slurry (CWS) atomization process in gasifier were carried out. Morphological classification of the CWS atomization was discussed in detail. The particle size distribution of CWS after atomization was obtained by image processing algorithm and statistical method. The primary atomization modes in gasifier can be divided into: Rayleigh-type breakup and superpulsating breakup. Besides, the spray angle and breakup length are negatively correlated with the oxygen-CWS relative velocity. The secondary atomization modes can be divided into: no breakup, tensile breakup, shear breakup and synergistic breakup. The statistical analysis shows that the particle size of the CWS after atomization show a negative correlation with the oxygen-CWS relative velocity. The greater the difference in relative velocity between oxygen and CWS, the better the atomization effect, but excessive oxygen velocity results in reduced gasification efficiency.

AB The advantages of both the passive and active heat and mass transfer enhancement techniques are used. A beam (rigid or flexible) as vortex generator (VG) is placed downstream of a cylindrical obstacle on the lower wall of a microchannel. The governing equations are solved using ALE approach. The elastic beam oscillates due to the forces exerted by the periodic flow behind the obstacle on it leading to the formation and separation of periodic vortices from the tip of the beam. These vortices disrupt the thermal boundary layer and prevent it from re-growing and hence increase the heat transfer rate dramatically. The total Nu number increases 18.46%, the Darcy friction factor experiences a decrease of 42.33%, the thermal performance factor increases 42% and the mixing index increases 16.86% with respect to the rigid beam case. Finally, the flexible beam used here would not experience failure in the laminar flow regime. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many industrial applications, ranging from chemical reactions to transport of suspensions, colloids can be produced and deposited within the processing equipment leading to significant fouling and clogging issues. Here, a continuous-flow reactor for the production of pharmaceutically relevant arylamines through the Buchwald-Hartwig synthesis is coupled to a microfluidic channel to investigate the complex interplay among fluid dynamics, crystallization, reaction and surface chemistry. The process of wall deposition and crystal formation under flow is studied in situ by fragmenting to the micron-scale the particles coming from the reactor and using glass microchannels. Tuning the flow rate, a dramatic change in crystal morphology and composition is found, from dendritic needle-like potassium tert-pentoxide structures to irregular colloidal clusters mainly made of potassium bromide. The results are characterized in terms of dimensionless parameters and provide novel insights for an improved understanding and control of fouling and crystal growth under flow.

AB This article presents the chemical analysis of jet fuel (Jet A-1) heteroatomic components generated as a result of thermal stressing. Jet A-1 was thermally stressed by flow and static tests in a single tube heat exchanger in the autoxidation regime (150-300 degrees C). Jet A-1 samples were analyzed by electrospray ion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Mass spectra of Jet A-1 recorded higher molecular weight components in the mass range 300-1000 Da. FTIR spectra revealed absorption bands for oxygen-containing species such as alcohol, phenol, and ether. Jet A-1 NMR spectra recorded heteroatomic alkoxy species. A lichen substance, gyrophoric acid was identified as Jet A-1 component. ESI-MS, FTIR and NMR spectra of unstressed jet fuel recorded peaks corresponding with gyrophoric acid. Natural products polyphenols and lichen derived compounds are excellent antioxidants, and their advantages as potential fuel additives are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Richards model for spontaneous imbibition of a wetting liquid into a porous medium is revisited. Two methods are presented to determine the effective parameter in the Richards equation, i.e. the saturation-dependent moisture transport coefficient D(S), from pore network simulations: The first method employs a quasi-static pore network model (QPNM), whereas the second method uses a dynamic pore network model (DPNM) to estimate D(S) in an inverse approach. The DPNM simulation results serve as a reference to assess the quality of these two parameter estimation methods. It is found that the solution of the Richards equation is very sensitive to D(S), especially when the porous medium is close to fully saturated. While the saturation levels over time obtained from solving the Richards equation with D(S) calculated from the inverse method match well with those from the DPNM, some discrepancy is observed when the QPNM is used to estimate D(S) instead.

AB The development of flexible lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with very high areal capacity becomes extremely important in achieving precision medicine due to the limited area of the involved LIB devices. However, the improvement of areal capacity using well-known conventional strategies unavoidably engenders serious polarization and gravimetric specific capacity fading. Herein, we report an entirely new insight into constructing superhigh areal-specific-capacity LIBs by designing an electron/ion dual-conductive macroporous MoS2/C hybrid film. A four-film stacked electrode even with a high mass loading of similar to 12.0 mg cm(2) can deliver an unprecedented high areal specific capacity of 7.21 mA h cm (2), almost double that of best material reported to date (4 mA h cm(2)). Such film electrode unexpectedly shows a positive linear increase of areal specific capacity versus layer number, but no gravimetric capacity (high value of similar to 600 mA h g(1)) change. The electrode kinetics studies reveal that such superhigh arealspecific-capacity lithium storage is mainly attributed to excellent ion transport (10(8) -10(9) cm(2) s(1)) and electron transfer (21.3 S cm(1)) of three-dimensional macroporous MoS2/C hybrid film. This work demonstrates a new concept of dual-conductive film electrode for the development and application of LIBs with tailorable areal specific capacity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study is focused on both experimental and theoretical analysis of fast pyrolysis of guaiacol, a major pyrolysate and a model monomeric compound of lignin. Fast pyrolysis experiments were performed in an analytical pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer in the temperature range of 450-650 degrees C. Thermodynamics and kinetics of 19 elementary reactions of 17 species were investigated using quantum chemical density functional theory calculations. Reaction pathways for the formation of four major phenols, viz. phenol, catechol, o-hydroxybenzaldehyde and o-cresol, were proposed. The homolytic cleavage of O-CH3 bond, with low bond dissociation energy of 57.7 kcal/mol, is shown to be the primary reaction for the generation of free radicals. The generation of o-hydroxyphenyl radical is found to be vital for the formation of phenol and cresol, while o-hydroxybenzyloxy radical is the key intermediate for the formation of o-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Multiple pathways for the formation of catechol were evaluated. A kinetic model was developed using the elementary reactions and their Arrhenius rate parameters. The concentration of the major products at different temperatures obtained from the model reasonably matched the trends in product yields from the experiments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian based numerical method is proposed to study the phase change bubble under the effect of noncondensable gas (NCG). In order to validate the underlying mathematical model, benchmark tests, including the bubble growth in quiescent superheated liquid and the condensation of rising bubble with NCG, are conducted. The numerical results by the phase change model, in which the mass transfer rate is directly determined by interfacial heat flux, is found to agree fairly well with analytical results, and the calculation of fluid flow and heat transfer by the present numerical approach is reasonable. Moreover, the numerical results of free rising bubble condensation with NCG are found to present good agreement with the experimental data on the evolution of bubble size, and the mass balance of the NCGs is proved to be achieved by the model. Finally, the subcooled boiling with NCG on a biphilic surface is numerically investigated, and the bubble behavior and internal distribution of the NCG are studied in detail. In the presence of NCG, the bubbles can even depart from the walls that are negatively superh yeated. The bubble keeps the bowl-shape for a long time before necking, which is consistent with the experimental observations. The contact line is found to stay at the boundary between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. The results also show that the local accumulation of the NCG near the bubble surface decreases the local apparent saturation temperature and inhibits the condensation, and the growth and departure of bubbles is thus promoted. In addition, the amount of NCG in the bubble is found to determine whether the bubble in the subcooled boiling is detached or not. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the first mathematical model simulating the recently discovered oscillatory behavior during CO oxidation on a Ni foil in a continuous-flow catalytic reactor. These oscillations occur in the presence of excess CO; thus, the well-known Sales-Turner-Maple model, simulating oscillations in oxygen excess, cannot be applied. We suggest a modification of the Sales-Turner-Maple model by introducing the precursor-mediated adsorption of CO. This made it possible to simulate the oscillations under reducing conditions. The suggested microkinetic model coupled with a continuous-flow reactor model predicts that the oscillations proceed on the partially oxidized catalyst because of the periodic formation and reduction of the surface oxide. The introduction of oxygen diffusion into the subsurface layers allows the description of the experimentally observed variation in Ni color during the oscillatory cycle. The developed model successfully reproduces experimental data as the temperature range of the oscillations together with their shape and amplitudes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main challenge in the flow and fluidization of Geldart Group C particles is their cohesive nature due to strong interparticle forces. The "nanoparticle modulation" technique is adopted to reduce the interparticle forces of Group C particles and thus significantly improve their flow and fluidization quality. Group C+ particles, a new type of fine particles with drastically reduced or insignificant interparticle forces, are created using the nano-modulation technique. Fundamental studies provided a comprehensive understanding of the flow and fluidization quality of Group C+ particles. Nano-modulation led to major enhancements to both the static and dynamic flowability of Group C+ particles. Moreover, Group C+ particles exhibited revolutionary advancements in fluidization, which enabled its pseudo-particulate fluidization over a wide range of operating gas velocities, up to 200-300% times that of bed expansion. The high bed expansion allows more gas to be retained in the bed and provides large volumes for gassolid interfacial contact, thus promoting chemical reactions, especially gas phase catalytic reactions.

AB The Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model is widely used for computational fluid dynamics simulations of gas-solid flows. For non-isothermal flows, the averaged conservation equations solved in the two-fluid model require closures for drag, gas-solid heat transfer, pseudo-turbulent velocity fluctuations and the pseudo-turbulent heat flux (PTHF). However, the pseudo-turbulence terms are usually neglected in two-fluid simulations due to the lack of accurate correlations. With the increase in computational power, closures for these terms are now available from particle-resolved direct-numerical simulation (PR-DNS). Here, the PTHF closure as well as the heat-transfer closure (i.e., the Nusselt number) extracted from PR-DNS are implemented in the two-fluid thermal energy equation in OpenFOAM. The implementation is validated by comparing the simulation results with the PR-DNS data for the temperature profiles. Based on the analysis of the thermal energy budget, the PTHF can have a significant contribution and neglecting it can lead to large errors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work is devoted to experimental and numerical studies of cavitation phenomena in Venturi tubes with different geometries. A two-phase mixture model has been validated against experimental data. The numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental data. Experimental studies have been carried out for two different Venturi tubes with convergent angles of 19 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively. The effect of the convergent angle on the cavitation performance was investigated experimentally and numerically. Both the numerical and experimental studies reveal that the change in the convergent angle has significant effects on flow characteristics and the generation of cavitation. It was shown that a 45 degrees convergent angle enhances cavitation in comparison with 19 degrees angle. A scaled-up study of the Venturi geometry has been conducted using CFD-based numerical simulations. Finally, a semi-empirical model enabling the prediction of cavitation in Venturi tubes has been developed and validated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a gemini zwitterionic viscoelastic surfactant with a sulfonic group, named VES-S, was synthesized. The surface activity properties of VES-S were found to show an ultra-low sensitivity to the salt concentration compared to those of cationic gemini surfactants, meaning that the packing parameter of VES-S varies little with increasing salinity. Through laboratory measurements, it was found that the addition of salt can enhance the viscoelasticity of the VES-S solution by tightening the net-work structure even at a high NaCl concentration (8 wt%), which indicated that VES-S was a viscoelastic surfactant with high salt tolerance. A series of laboratory evaluations showed that the clean fracturing fluids prepared by VES-S and simulated seawaters fulfilled the requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations, which proved that VES-S was an excellent and reliable viscoelastic surfactant with a high salt tolerance that can be used to prepare seawater-based clean fracturing fluids.

Two different bed compositions, mono dispersed (100 wt% of each solid) and 50 wt% mixture of the solids, were studied. A rich data base, including instantaneous velocities, mean and RMS velocities, granular temperature, etc., were calculated by suitable post-processing. Further, Hurst exponent, autocorrelation function, segregation index, Kolmogorov entropy, and correlation dimension were calculated using time series data to understand the mixing and chaotic nature of the fluidized bed for each set of data. Good degree of mixing was observed even at a low velocity of 0.07 m/s. Kolmogorov entropy and correlation dimension indicate regime change at liquid inlet velocity of 0.1 m/s for both mono and 50 wt% binary bed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowing the instantaneous flow structure in a gas-solid circulating fluidized bed (CFB) is extremely crucial for the understanding of fast fluidization and the development of numerical models. Up to now, numerous studies have been reported on the instantaneous flow structure, but essential information, such as phase classification, solids holdup mapping, macro-scale fluctuation and much more, remains insufficient for a thorough understanding. In this work, the instantaneous flow structure was captured in large-scale CFBs using high-speed imaging and fiber optic sensing. The instantaneous solids holdup mapping across the riser is first computed from images with a verified calibration between solids holdup and grayscale. Based on the solids holdup characteristics, the gas-solid flow in a CFB riser is classified into distinctive phases. Macroscopically, there is a trough phase having continuous low solids holdup and a crest phase having continuous high solids holdup, causing the mean solids holdup across the riser to fluctuate significantly. Within the trough phase, there are trough clusters (particle aggregations) surrounded by dispersed particles (dilute atmosphere). Within the crest phase, there are crest clusters (particle aggregations) surrounded by coalesced particles (dense atmosphere). The above flow structure is further verified with the instantaneous solids holdup obtained using fiber optic sensing in terms of solids holdup characteristics and phase dimensions. Collectively, this study deepens the understanding of fast fluidization, prepares for further phase characterization, and contributes to the development of numerical modeling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Decisions made by approaches that only consider the environmental domain could result in unexpected outcomes due to burdens shifting to economic and social domains. These consequences could occur through the entire supply chain at multiple spatial scales. In this work, the process-to-planet (P2P) multiscale modeling framework is integrated with the rectangular choice-of-technology (RCOT) consequential approach. The resulting RCOT-P2P multiscale technology choice modeling framework takes account of market effects, such as economic resource constraints, as a consequential approach for designing engineering systems and their supply chain networks. The integrated modeling framework can represent different stakeholders' interests by considering engineering, environmental, and economic dimensions. The case study focuses on installation of a new green urea production system in a watershed where there are limited supplies of resources, such as water and land area. We identify how the adoption of new technologies could change and be limited by market constraints, as the urea demand increases. This multiscale consequential framework is useful for modeling substitution effects of emerging technologies while considering market effects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The role of homogeneous steam reforming of acetylene in the partial

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE

ID NATURAL-GAS
AB The conversion of natural gas to syngas is a key and most expensive stage of modern gas chemical technologies. As a promising alternative to existing technologies, a non-catalytic matrix conversion of natural gas to syngas was proposed. However, the reaction products, in addition to CO and H-2, also contain unreacted methane, CO2 and acetylene. The latter is the most problem impurity, as it is a precursor of soot and other heavy products. In this work, the kinetic analysis of changes in the composition of the products during the matrix conversion of rich methane-air mixtures up to the establishment of the thermodynamic equilibrium was carried out. Three characteristic stages of the process were identified. The first stage of fast reactions involving oxygen is completed in a very short time (similar to 10 (2)s at 1500 K) with almost complete oxygen consumption and the formation of CO, H-2, CO2, H2O and some minor products of methane pyrolysis, mainly acetylene, but at their ratio, far from equilibrium. At the second stage, slow reactions of steam reforming of the formed products significantly increase the amount of hydrogen. The ratio [CO2][HO2]/[CO][H2O] reaches an equilibrium value, but not the concentration of individual products due to incomplete conversion of acetylene and methane. At the third and longest stage, the system reaches equilibrium, and acetylene is not among the equilibrium products. The results of kinetic modeling and experimental study of partial oxidation of methane in matrix-type reformers have shown the important role of acetylene steam conversion in the post-flame zone. This reaction leads to a substantial decrease of methane and acetylene with a simultaneous increase in the yields of hydrogen and CO. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Impinging liquid jets are widely employed in cleaning operations to remove residual soiling layers from walls and other surfaces of process vessels. Insoluble viscoplastic soiling layers represent challenging soils to clean as removal is primarily by hydraulic forces. The rheological behaviour of a commercial petroleum jelly was investigated and shown to exhibit significant creep below its critical stress. The removal of thin (<1 mm) layers of petroleum jelly from glass and Perspex surfaces by coherent water jets impinging normally on vertical walls were studied experimentally. The jet clears a roughly circular area, forming a berm of removed material at the cleaning front. The shape of the berm was measured and found to depend on the ratio of the height of the water film and the initial thickness of the soil layer. The data were compared with the adhesive removal of viscoplastic soils proposed by Glover et al. (2016) with the momentum flow rate calculated using the results in Bhagat and Wilson (2016). The asymptotic approach to a cleaning limit observed in experiments with static nozzles required modification of the model: a semi-empirical term which represents the transition to a creeping regime is presented. The modified model allowed results obtained using static nozzles to predict the shape of the region cleaned by a jet from a similar nozzle moving across a soiled plate. The influence of process conditions on model parameters is discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MORPHOLOGY
AB Unsaturated water flow through thin porous layers plays an important role in many applications such as water management in hydrogen fuel cells and hygiene products. It is well known that void spaces between adjacent thin layers (i.e., layer-layer interfaces) considerably impact through-plane water infiltration. Therefore, it is essential to account for this fact in the model development. Recently, we reported Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements of water infiltration into a stack of two thin porous layers of 43-gsm polyester and showed crucial effect of the inter-layer space on the transfer of liquid from one layer to the other. In this work, we aim to test two numerical models of water infiltration into two (partially dry) thin porous layers. One is the standard Richards model for unsaturated flow and the other is Reduced Continua Model (RCM). The latter model is based on thickness-averaged properties and does not provide through-plane distribution of saturation in the layers. Layer-scale material properties are experimentally measured. Sub-layer material properties, which are used in the Richards model, are obtained by pore-morphology modeling of micro-CT images. Our results show that the RCM is superior to the Richards model. It can predict NMR measurements of temporal evolutions of water contents in the two layers quite well. Moreover, it is computationally much more efficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many complex flow phenomena encountered in chemical engineering lack fundamental understanding. Central to this problem is the lack of non-invasive, in situ measurement tools that can simultaneously track the motion and dynamics of different particle species across the entire phase space of the flow. To this end, a novel algorithm was developed for simultaneously tracking multiple particles using a Positron Emission Tomography scanner. The algorithm discretizes the back-to-back gamma rays emanating from multiple radio-labelled particles, and uses a Voronoi tessellation to create a density map of the points. The locations of the tracers are determined using a clustering technique. A series of experiments was performed to test the precision, robustness, and performance of the algorithm. Twenty tracers were successfully tracked, limited only by the amount of available sodium-22 isotope. The presented algorithm resulted in a RMSE of 1.26 mm. The precision was found to be dependent on the level of discretization, and is robust in that the loss of a tracer (due to exiting the field of view, high acceleration, or tracer collision) is handled internally, with no need for human correction. The proposed algorithm can also be easily parallelized. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) has been widely used as the fouling-release coatings due to its low surface energy. However, for marine anti-biofouling applications, current PDMS-based materials with hydrophobic property still suffer from marine slime attachment. Therefore, the design of novel amphiphilic coatings by modifying PDMS with hydrophilic polymers has been widely explored. In this work, based on poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), a novel hydrophilicity-active poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone-co-methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate-co- 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PNMBH) was synthesized using a robust free radical polymerization method. Next, amphiphilic coatings were prepared by crosslinking different amounts of PNMBH with PDMS at room temperature. The resultant PNMBH-PDMS coatings were characterized with water contact angle tests, presenting their increased hydrophilicity and the optimal PNMBH content (10%). Moreover, the anti-biofouling performance of these coatings was evaluated using proteins (bovine serum albumin and fibrinogen), bacteria (Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Grampositive Staphylococcus aureus), and marine diatom (Navicula parva). Compared with pristine PDMS coating, PNMBH-PDMS coatings could reduce similar to 82% adhesion of fibrinogen, similar to 97% adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus, and similar to 97% adhesion of diatom, the major composition of marine slime. More importantly, PNMBH-PDMS coatings were also tested in the marine field, and results showed their excellent antibiofouling performance for at least 4 months in the ocean. This work developed a novel amphiphilic coating with appealing marine anti-biofouling performance and might provide new opportunities for marine coating applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Here we model release of multidrug cocktails from small micelles. As most emerging anticancer agents remain sparingly soluble in water, they require carriers such as poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA) micelles to enhance their delivery. These micelles have been used as vectors for multidrug cocktails (e.g., the hydrophobic anticancer agents paclitaxel, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin, and rapamycin). Empirically determined agent release takes hours and half-lives depend on oil-water partition coefficients, a representative thermodynamic parameter. This contrasts with the assertion that the cocktail release rate is diffusion controlled, with diffusion time scales less than a millisecond. Here we resolve this inconsistency in mechanism using a "lumped capacitance" method. The two parameter equation that results provides excellent agreement with experimental release profiles. Model time scales depend on the micelle radius, external mass transfer coefficient, and lumped partition coefficient. These findings enable tuning of release rates of multidrug mixtures from micelles, which will become increasingly important because many new drug candidates remain hydrophobic. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Model-based design of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes has received much interest in academia and industry. Model parameter uncertainties, however, might deteriorate the predicted process performance. Probability-based robust process design concepts as a countermeasure against uncertainties might be implemented. Here, parameter uncertainties are typically limited to Gaussian parameter distributions. However, parameter uncertainties derived with experimental data can be correlated and arbitrarily distributed. In our previous work, transformation techniques were combined with the point estimate method (PEM) to address non-Gaussian and correlated parameter distributions, but at the cost of additional nonlinearities and approximation errors. In this work, we take advantage of Gaussian mixture distributions (GMD) and decompose the parameter distribution into a finite set of Gaussian distributions using the Expectation-Maximization approach. Combining the GMD with the PEM ensures a proper and effective uncertainty quantification. The improved PEM algorithm is applied to a freezedrying process (lyophilization) aiming for high-quality products with minimum processing time. Results obtained suggest that the novel GMD-PEM algorithm has the potential to outperform conventional robustification concepts regarding credibility and efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Polyaniline (PANI) particles were prepared via chemical oxidative polymerization in microreactors within the liquid-liquid slug flow regime. The effect of co-solvent (methanol, glycol or glycerol) on the morphology, chemical structure, thermal stability and electrochemical performance of final polymer products was investigated. Hansen's solubility parameters and Flory-Huggins model were introduced to explicate the microstructure variation of PANI particles synthesized with different media. The characteristic dimension of PANI particles tended to be smaller with the decrease of the Flory parameter of the reaction medium. Electrochemical measurement indicated that the specific capacitance of PANI could be improved by adding an organic co-solvent into the reaction medium. The maximum specific capacitance of 426F/g was achieved at the current density of 1 A/g with the voltage window ranging from -0.2 to 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M H2SO4 solution. The maximum energy density reached 59.2 Wh/kg with the power density of 500 W/kg. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A non-intrusive measurement method was used to quantify the mass transfer between an oxygen bubble (with a spherical equivalent diameter in the range 2-4 mm) and the turbulent sodium sulfite solution in which the bubble was driven to circulate. The variations of the position, size, and velocity of the single bubble with time were derived from the images recorded by a high-speed camera, and the average reactive mass transfer coefficients were calculated from the reduction of the volume of the bubble. The enhancement factors under various flow conditions caused by the catalyzed chemical reaction were provided. The flow field in the chamber was measured by 2D particle image velocimetry (PIV). The single-phase instantaneous flow field was compared with the multi-phase flow field in terms of the effect of the single bubble. A correlation of the bubble Sherwood number with the bubble Reynolds number was obtained under different liquid Reynolds numbers. We found that the slip velocity has a high capacity to keep the bubble surface mobile. Both the bubble Reynolds number based on the bubble slip velocity and liquid Reynolds number contributed to the mass transfer in the turbulent chamber. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Investigation was made of the effect of addition of Au to 15%Ni/Al2O3 catalysts used in the steam reforming of methane. The addition of Au was performed by impregnation of reduced Ni catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of adsorbed CO (DRIFTS-CO). DRIFTS-CO showed that Au modified the surface structure of Ni. Au blocked the low coordination Ni sites with high electron density and high activity for CH4 activation. Furthermore, it modified the high coordination Ni, causing geometric and electronic effects, changing the CO adsorption from bridge to linear form, and increasing the electron density of Ni-Au, relative to Ni at sites such as Ni(1 1 1). Addition of Au to the Ni catalysts had a strong influence on the activation of CH4. A compensation effect was observed between the apparent activation energy (E-a(app)) and the natural logarithm of the pre-exponential factor (In(k(0))), obtained by fitting of the Arrhenius equation to the rate of the overall reaction. Greater Au addition decreased the catalytic activity, with linear increase of E-a(app) with increase of ln(k(0)). These results suggested that the intermediates formed by decomposition of CH4, in the step determining the overall velocity, presented low interaction with the Ni surface. The proposed mechanisms also suggested that the activation of CH4 required two Ni neighbor sites. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For practical applications the Euler-Euler two-fluid model relies on suitable closure relations describing interfacial exchange processes. An ongoing effort at HZDR has led to a validated set of closures for adiabatic bubbly flows that is applicable under a rather broad range of conditions including flows in pipes and bubble columns. Up to now, however, only flows with stationary mean values have been considered. The present contribution extends the model validation to dynamic flow phenomena by considering a periodically oscillating bubble plume. Consequently, the turbulence model then runs in URANS mode. Literature data for a partially aerated flat rectangular bubble column are used for comparison. In particular, results for the plume oscillation period show good agreement between simulation and experiment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A comprehensive kinetic study, based on V-based catalysts (Vanadium Pyro-Phosphate, VPP, VOx/TiO2 and VOx/ZrO2), was modeled to retrieve the surface reaction mechanism and kinetic parameters for the ammoxidation of ethanol to acetonitrile. In all the cases, the catalysts showed a moderate to good acetonitrile selectivity, that in turn resulted correlated primarily to the reaction temperature, while the byproducts distribution was more influenced by the thermodynamic stability of the reacting mixture.
   A large and comprehensive collection of data on ammoxidation of C2 substrates for acetonitrile production was analysed and 5 groups of experiments on VOx-based catalysts (operating in the temperature range 250-450 degrees C) were selected. The base reactant was ethanol and ammonia and oxygen were fed in optimal ratios of 1:3-1:4 mol/mol.
   A kinetic model was then derived applying the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) approach to accepted catalytic oxidation mechanisms: for every catalytic material, eight to ten reactions with rates described by the Arrhenius formula were employed. Fixing the reaction orders according to the mechanistic assumption and adjusting only the kinetic and adsorption parameters, the calculated molar fractions of ethanol, ammonia, acetonitrile and ethylene resulted in good agreement with the extensive collection of experimental data available.

AB This study investigated the performance of VMD and AGMD system for separating water from copper-containing solution. The impacts of various operating parameters and module parameters on VMD performance were studied in terms of permeate flux, rejection rate, total water production, specific thermal (electric) energy consumption, pressure drop and thermal efficiency. A relatively stable VMD performance with high rejection rate was achieved due to the chemical stability and the sponge-like structure of membrane. It was found that enhancing membrane length would increase thermal consumption and pressure drop simultaneously. Moreover, the membrane module with high packing density performed better in utilizing lower thermal energy. The maximum permeate flux and the minimum specific thermal energy consumption of VMD was 21.82 kg/m(2)-h and 674.5 kWh/m(3) respectively. Meanwhile, AGMD was superior for energy saving compared with VMD. In this study, VMD and AGMD process have shown the potential to treat copper-containing solution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Multi-dimensional foam structure analysis is critical to identify the properties of supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)) foamed materials, but most applied analysis only focus on two-dimensional (2D) foam morphology. A novel method of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), a powerful technique for material structure characterization, is then successfully applied for the first time to construct the multidimensional (including 2D and 3D) foam structure obtained in scCO(2) foaming. In CLSM characterization, fluorescent dye is the key point to enhance polymeric foams' fluorescence intensity so that the multidimensional foam structure is clearly observed. In the multi-dimensional analysis, it is noticed that the statistical cell size via 2D characterization is only 0.79 of that via 3D characterization. This specific conversion coefficient among multi-dimensional foam morphology is further verified in theoretical analysis via micro-/nano-cellular foam simulation. The universal specific conversion coefficient (2D/3D_(cell size) = 0.79 and 2D/3D_(cell density) = 1.2) then enables a 3D foam construction for polymeric foams made from scCO(2) foaming with only 2D foam characterization data no matter the foam has a micro- or nano-cellular structure.

AB This paper reports a fast, cost-effective and environmental-friendly method to engineer the membrane structure, and simultaneously enhance the permeance and fouling resistance in reverse osmosis (RO). By free radical polymerization in water, copolymers containing fouling-resistant zwitterionic and hydroxyl-based anchoring groups are synthesized and quickly bonded to the polyamide membrane surface. The copolymer also functions as the molecular engine to reduce the thickness of the polyamide layer and drill nanopores, thereby re-shaping its 3D structure for higher permeability. It is revealed that by design of the size and functionality of the copolymer, the water permeability and salt rejection may be simultaneously increased. Our membrane demonstrates a pure water permeability of 10.5 L m(2) h(1) bar(1), NaCl rejection of 98.1%, and superior fouling resistance towards various foulants and realistic feed. This paper provides a new perspective for the development of highly permeable, fouling-resistance membranes not only for RO, but also nanofiltration. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel tree-like branching network with polygonal loops is designed based on the network of leaf vein. In this study, analytical models are presented for the effective permeabilities through the undamaged and damaged tree-like branching networks with polygonal loops based on Hagen-Poiseuille equation and Darcy's law. These effective permeability models are explicitly related to the structural parameters and the damaged number (or points) of the tree-like branching networks. We have discussed quantitatively the influences of the length and diameter ratios of channels, Y-shaped bifurcation angle, total branching level number, and damaged number (or points) on the effective permeability. Besides, numerical simulations are performed, and compared with the model predictions. Good agreement indicates that the present models for the permeability are reasonable. These analyses of the networks may provide a basis for scientific and engineering applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents a hybrid bubble hologram processing approach for measuring the size and 3D distribution of bubbles over a wide range of size and shape. The proposed method consists of five major steps, including image enhancement, digital reconstruction, small bubble segmentation, large bubble/cluster segmentation, and post-processing. Two different segmentation approaches are proposed to extract the size and the location of bubbles in different size ranges from the 3D reconstructed optical field. Specifically, a small bubble is segmented based on the presence of the prominent intensity minimum in its longitudinal intensity profile, and its depth is determined by the location of the minimum. In contrast, a large bubble/cluster is segmented using a modified watershed segmentation algorithm and its depth is measured through a wavelet-based focus metric. Our processing approach also determines the inclination angle of a large bubble with respect to the hologram recording plane based on the depth variation along its edge on the plane. The accuracy of our processing approach on the measurements of object size and 3D distributions are assessed through synthetic bubble holograms and oil droplet holograms from an experiment separately. In addition, we evaluate the ability of this algorithm to estimate the bubble inclination with respect to the hologram recording plane through measuring a 3D-printed physical target of pillars with different inclination angles. The holographic measurement technique is further implemented to capture the fluctuation of instantaneous gas leakage rate from a ventilated supercavity generated in a water tunnel experiment. Overall, our paper introduces an inexpensive and compact solution for high resolution characterization of bubbles and other particles in multiphase flows from a broad range of applications.

AB The uniform mixing is necessary in many processes such as those used in pharmaceutical, chemical and petrochemical industries. The present work studies the influence of vibration characteristics on mixing of binary mixtures of spheres produced in a vibrationally fluidized bed by using discrete element method. Solid-like flow pattern was observed in low frequencies and amplitudes, while as the vibration got stronger, particles behaved fluid-like, and convection rolls were generated. The generation and movement of convection rolls played a fundamental role in mixing within vibrated beds. It was realized that mixing was generally improved by increasing the vibration amplitude. In contrast, an optimal frequency was found in each amplitude, by which the best mixing occurred. The particles average velocity always increased by amplitude at a fixed frequency, while the mixing was not necessarily improved. It was found that the results were in qualitative agreement with some previous experimental and numerical studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous modelling of fixed-bed, Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactors has demonstrated the advantages relative to spherical pellets of using cylindrical and shaped pellets to provide improved transport attributes under conditions relevant to industrial operation. However, mass transport models have focussed on the investigation of transport within pellets with spherical symmetry, whilst detailed investigations of more complex shapes have not been undertaken. Here, a pseudo-isothermal, steady-state, two-dimensional model was investigated for catalyst pellets of cylindrical form, both solid and hollow. A cobalt-based catalyst was considered at conditions where the rate of condensable hydrocarbon generation is large enough to result in the accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons in the pores of a catalyst. It was found that effectiveness factors were bounded by those of sphere and slab above and below Thiele moduli of similar to 0.75 and similar to 1.15, respectively, for the conditions examined, with the effectiveness factors exceeding those of both sphere and slab models between these moduli. Here, comparisons were made on the basis of the characteristic diffusion length, the catalyst particle's volume divided by its external surface area. However, values of the FT chain growth parameter, alpha, between these values of Thiele modulus were lower than those of both sphere and slab geometry, and thus under these conditions hollow cylinders gave the greatest methane selectivity.

AB A new, simple, cost effective and facile method of adsorption of oil from oil - water mixture on self-organized patterns formed over a soft thin elastic film has been developed, which is of great ecological importance. Surface corrugations (such as columns, labyrinths and cavities evolved spontaneously due to instability on the surfaces of a thin soft elastic PDMS film in adhesive contact with a contactor) along with the oleophilic nature of the film help in selective adsorption of the oil from the oil-water mixture into the intervening surface spaces. The increase in RMS surface roughness brought about either by increase in adsorbent weight or by formation of a columnar structure (instead of cavities or labyrinths) was found to have a significant incremental effect on the true surface area creation by formation of increased number of oil adsorption sites: leading to higher oil penetration and thus, higher oil adsorption. For 0.3 wt% of adsorbent, adsorption was found to be maximum for columnar structures at 23%, followed by cavities at 15% and minimum with labyrinth at around 12%. The ratio (d(p)/d(d)) of the substrate pore size dimension (d(p)) to the surface oil droplet dimension (d(d)) in crude oil, motor oil, diesel and petrol were found to be progressively lower and hence the maximum adsorption and penetration in the columnar patterns was recognized in case of crude oil. The different oil morphology on adsorption can be greatly used as a marker to identify different category of oil. The surface columns fabricated by self-organization was found to adsorb double the weight of the adsorbent, and moreover the quantity of the polymeric material required in the present case was much less than that for bulk adsorbents, and also does not involve any additional functionalization or use of any external template material, making this method a very suitable one for selective oil adsorption.

AB A model is established to investigate low temperature (<300 degrees C), medium temperature (300-550 degrees C) and high temperature (>550 degrees C) performance of the continuous regenerative diesel particulate filter (CR-DPF) assisted by electric regeneration regarding to balance point temperature, regeneration speed and outlet temperature respectively and relevant influencing factors. Results show that inlet PM concentration and inlet flow rate are positively correlated to balance point temperature and vice versa for initial soot loading and intake NOx concentration. Increasing intake NOx concentration and flow rate increase rapid continuous regeneration speed. At low and medium temperatures, rapid thermal response tends to increase passive regeneration speed and the trend is more with decreasing wall thickness and channel density. In the high temperature range, outlet temperature increases and temperature gradients presented in the early stage of regeneration become steeper with decreasing channel density and wall thickness. However, "L/D" has limited impact on low, medium and high temperature performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reactive dividing wall column (RDWC) is a highly integrated apparatus that combines the features of reactive distillation and dividing wall column technology. The high degree of integration results in complex interactions between vapour-liquid equilibrium, chemical reaction and component distribution. This leads to a considerably more complex column design and operation than for conventional distillation columns. Therefore, precise simulation models are a prerequisite for a successful implementation and operation of this technology. A newly developed rate-based (NEQ) RDWC model for packed columns is presented and a detailed investigation on the influence of separation modeling was carried out. Comprehensive experimental RDWC data are presented for the reference system of the butyl acetate transesterification with hexanol and employed for a model validation. The validation results for the NEQ model are compared to the well-known equilibrium stage (EQ) approach. The rate-based model is shown to predict the inner flows and concentrations of the column with higher precision. Furthermore, an analysis of the validation results enhances the understanding of the interactions between separation, chemical reaction and reactant conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigated the mechanism of single-bubble fragmentation during mechanical stirring under different trailing vortex conditions. Experiments and numerical simulations using the LES-VOF method were carried out under different bubble sizes and locations of bubble injection. We found that the following three phenomena can cause bubble fragmentation: collision with impeller blade; shear stress in the boundary layer ahead of the impeller blade; and interaction between trailing vortices and the bubble. In the last case, the mechanism of fragmentation can be categorized into six types, which are determined by the relationship between the bubble behavior and the trailing vortices. Thus, we clarified the relationship between trailing vortices and bubble fragmentation for the first time in a stirred vessel. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, thermo-mechanical responses of shape memory polymers and their composites are investigated for improving the shape memory effect. First, a chain model composed of thermal and mechanical parts has been proposed. The properties of thermal and mechanical parts are considered by way of analogy with thermo-mechanical responses in macro-scope. Subsequently, the instantaneous elastic modulus of chain system under different temperatures is examined to calibrate the material's parameters by adjusting several variables: chain length, chain number, and distribution function. Next, numerical simulations of polyurethane composites are performed and compared with experimental data to validate the applicability of the model. Furthermore, the shape memory processes of polymer composites are optimized by changing the structure of the chain system: geometry, cross link, and internal filler. From the results, it can be concluded that the shape memory effect of polymer composite can be improved by increasing cross link density. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Highly curved helical pipes offer attracting potentialities for intensified mass/heat transfer performances as they generate intense Dean-type vortices. The evaluation of friction factor in such geometries is necessary for assessing the trade-offs between the increase of transfer efficiency and the associated specific energy requirement. Unfortunately, such data are lacking for highly curved helixes, probably due to the difficulty to manufacture these geometries through traditional manufacturing techniques.
   In this paper, CFD simulations are carried out for determining the laminar flow friction factor in helical pipes, particularly highly curved ones. For an experimental validation of the numerical results, a highly curved helix was built by 3D-printing. Existing correlations are shown to fail for the accurate prediction of the friction factor in highly curved helixes. A new correlation is thus proposed. An excellent agreement is obtained between the experimental pressure drop measurements and the proposed correlation predictions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle of a freeze-thaw valve (FTV) created in a 3D-printed fluidic device. Portions of channels are enveloped by cooling and heating jackets, and a heat transfer liquid is recirculated through the two jackets. A frozen plug is created in selected portions of the target-channel and the heating jacket ensures that a selected temperature is maintained in the rest of the channel. An FTV can be 3D-printed in a wide variety of materials as single piece devices with no moving parts without high resolution requirements of the printing process. Such valves can therefore be incorporated in devices for liquid chromatography or multi-step synthesis process.
   Computational fluid dynamic simulations of a prototype T-junction piece show the two zones to be well defined at coolant and heating jacket flow-rates greater than 1 mL/min, with power consumptions of 1-3 W. The prototype was printed in Titanium 6Al-4V using selective laser melting and the frozen plug was shown to withstand 20 MPa of pressure. Switching times between states 1 (with a frozen section) and 2 (with both sections thawed) were 0.2-3 min in computational and experimental tests. The scalability of the freeze-thaw system was demonstrated using a multi-gate valve containing 33 junctions without a proportionate increase in operational complexity or switching times.

AB In this study, the effects of ship motion on the CO2 absorption performance of the offshore columns (i.e., the separation columns installed on offshore floating units) are investigated. Specifically, a pilot scale column with 0.4 m diameter and 4 m packed height is used, and NaOH/air system is implemented to measure the CO2 absorption performance of the column under both vertical and offshore conditions. The experimental results obtained from the vertical conditions are used to validate the mathematical model which can compute the effective surface area of the separation columns. Then, such model is used to produce the reference values for the experimental results obtained from the various offshore conditions, where tilt angle, roll motion conditions, liquid load, gas factor, liquid surface tension and liquid viscosity are used as the design variables. The reduction factor is proposed, which can describe the change in the absorption performance of the offshore columns with respect to the important factors. From our study, the tilt angle was shown to be the most important factor, and the mass transfer efficiency was reduced by 8.4% in average (compared to the value obtained under the vertical condition) when the tilt angle was 6 degrees. It was also shown that the roll motion can enhance the absorption performance of offshore columns under certain operating conditions, and the maximum improvement (6.7%) in the mass transfer efficiency was achieved when the liquid load, roll motion amplitude and period were 14 m(3)/m(2) hr, 8 degrees and 45 s, respectively.

AB An effective approach to improve catalytic performance of a Cu-based catalyst for the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is to minimize particle size and to increase the dispersion of active Cu species. Here, highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles (NPs) supported on carbon microspheres (CMs) catalyst has been fabricated through a multi-step process involving cationic ion-exchange, high-temperature carbonization and H-2 reduction. The Cu NPs size shows a volcanic curve versus the heat-treatment temperature. Cu/CMs catalyst calcined at 500 degrees C with mean Cu NP size of 5.5 nm, displayed the highest catalytic activity, with a methanol conversion of 5.0%, DMC selectivity of 100% and space time yield of DMC of 3770 mg/(gh). The sulfonic acid groups on the IR 120 resin endows its strong anchoring ability for copper precursors, leading to a decrease in particle size and better dispersion of Cu active species, which plays a key role in promoting the catalytic performance of Cu/CMs catalyst. However, a calcination temperature higher than 500 degrees C was proved to be detrimental because of extensive damage of the sulfonic acid groups. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel hydrocyclone with arc inlet and convex cone is proposed to obtain the higher particles classification sharpness than the conventional design. The classification of the micron scale manganese dioxide particle is taken as a study case, and various methods are used to perform the modelling and optimization of the novel geometrical structure. Two performance indexes have been taken into consideration in the multi-objective optimization which are the classification sharpness, S-s and total pressure drop, Delta P. The numerical experiments designed via response surface methodology are carried out using computation fluid dynamics simulations of Eulerian-Eulerian strategy. The obtained data sets are utilized for modelling the performance indexes by support vector machine (SVM) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) approaches. The optimal structure with the classification sharpness of 0.956 is searched using the genetic algorithm (GA) in contrast to the conventional design of 0.849. Flow field analysis illustrates that the extended radial space, strengthened centrifugal field and inlet pre-classification effect of the optimal design improve the classification sharpness. However, the narrower inlet cross area leads to a higher pressure drop. The Pareto front of the multi-objective optimization is obtained using the NSGA-II algorithm to provide alternatives for the optimal performance of the novel hydrocyclone. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The structural and electronic properties of Pt/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts catalysts for quinoline hydrodenitrogenation were modified by introducing TiO2. The results indicated that the addition of TiO2 enhanced the reducibility of PtOx species, which increased the number of metallic Pt active sites. TiO2 facilitated quinoline hydrodenitrogenation over Pt/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts catalysts, with an increase in activity from 80.6% to 91.5% at 340 degrees C and 3 MPa when the TiO2 content was 16.3 wt%; and improved resistance to the inhibiting effects of sulfur species, therefore the hydrodenitrogenation activity decreased less sharply. High activity in dibenzothiophene hydrodesulfurization, i.e., above 91%, was maintained with different sulfur concentrations. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that dibenzothiophene and quinoline had comparable adsorption energies on a metallic Pt surface. We propose that the partially reduced TiO2 mitigated inhibition by dibenzothiophene and enhanced the hydrogenation of quinoline via the formation of electron-rich Pt species. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hydrate-induced water migration is an unusual behaviour that occurs in certain hydrate formation processes, such as in the formation of propane-containing hydrate. This study is the first to investigate the continuous, staged processes of constant-volume formation, constant-pressure reformation and exhaust dissociation of CO2-C3H8 hydrates using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. Real-time MRI images indicate that the formation of CO2-C3H8 hydrates draw water from its surroundings, causing the local water saturation to increase. As the concentrated water can further form hydrates and extend to the gas phase, the water appears as though it climbs upward through the glass sand and hydrate zone towards the gas phase. Experiments under different formation pressures indicate that the locations of hydrate-induced water migration are uncertain and depend on hydrate nucleation. The evolution processes of hydrate-induced water migration under different initial pressures have good similarity. In addition, water migration will still occur during the reformation stage. The initial pressure has great effects on both the formation and dissociation of hydrate. In addition, faster dissociation may make the water move upward due to strong gas release. The findings in this study are significant to future research on propane-containing hydrate, especially for hydrate-based seawater desalination applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) integrated with a new localstructure-dependent (LSD) drag model and modified reaction kinetics are used to simulate the bubbling fluidized bed methanation process. The nonlinear Hertzian model is employed to describe the particleparticle collision process. An approximate image processing method (AIPM) is developed to investigate the bubble properties in the reactive gas-solid fluidized bed, by which the bubbles can be located, measured, and tracked from the CFD-DEM results. The results of the bubble properties and reaction behavior are in good agreement with the correlations in the literature and the experimental data, respectively. The sensitivity study of particles Young's modulus indicates that this parameter has a minor influence on the simulation results but the simulation efficiency can be significantly improved by reducing this parameter. The feasibility of the isothermal flow assumption is also validated for simulations of the fluidized bed methanation process by the CFD-DEM method. In addition, the comparison between CFD-DEM and the two-fluid model (TFM) results shows that both models gave similar results for the reactor performance but the TFM provides smaller bubble size.

AB A simple colloidal drop generally forms ring like patterns after drying. The deposition morphology of the dried drop changes significantly when such a drop dries in the vicinity of another similar drop. Here we present an observational study and statistical analysis of the patterns formed inside an isolated as well as interacting drops of gelatin containing sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). In all the cases, multiple concentric regions of solute particles combined with the polymer gel appear as the drops dry up. Needle crystals of sulfur and coacervates of salt and gelatin are visible in some regions. The outer region becomes non-uniform, so does the size distribution of the needle crystals and coacervates. The non-uniformity increases with proximity of the drops. Here we propose a novel mechanism of growing patterns inside the single drop during drying and correlate that with the results obtained for interacting drops. This study and the proposed mechanism provide insights into the future studies of drying drops under different physical conditions. Further we explore the statistical characteristics of the single and interacting drops using the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images. Next, we report fractal and image texture analyses along with object shape statistics of the drop FESEM images, under various experimental conditions. Several statistical hypothesis tests have been carried out to identify the most significant features. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high-temperature-uncooled-developed air jet mill system (AJMS) is one of the most effective grinding technologies for uniformed particle size. AJMS is the core technology in raw material manufacturing technology to grind and classify materials efficiently with a classifier that crushes raw materials by high-pressure compressible nozzles at high temperature into micro size particles and separates them by the desired size by using the centrifugal force of the rotor. However, the characteristics of grinding and classifying are affected by internal factors with occurring of complexed physical phenomena. To overcome the challenge, we used a discrete element model (DEM) and Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to clarify the relationship of the correlation with the actual design variables by predicted the motion of particles with the operating conditions and obtained optimized conditions. This research is described pulverization models of the AJMS with particle-structure interactions through optimized design value from DEM. Based on these results, we suggest a design method of AJMS to grinding the ceramic particles 2.86 mu m of an average and 1.32 mu m of a standard deviation from 14,000 rpm of the classifying rotor.

AB The field of microbial electrosynthesis gained much attention since it allows the conversion of electrical energy into valuable chemicals. The technology is now on the turning point from lab scale to first industrial applications. We show a rational Scale-Up using similarity theory from a 1-L reactor to a 50-L reactor for the production of methane via bioelectromethanogenesis. Pure culture experiments with Methanococcus maripaludis were carried out. Since this was the largest pure culture bioelectromethanogenesis experiment shown so far, also the total methane production rate of 11.7 mmol/d was the highest reported. However, the space time yield was with 0.23 mmol/l*d only 16% of the yield reached in the lab scale reactor. The Coulombic and energy efficiency were much higher than in lab scale. Different reasons for this gap, especially inhibition by reactor material and low current densities, are discussed to avoid such losses in performance in future research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper addresses impacts of three synthesis schemes, i.e. the direct scheme, the indirect scheme and the hybrid scheme on the economic and operational performances of hydrogen networks through a comprehensive comparative analysis. The synthesis models, flexibility analysis models and flexible design models for hydrogen networks with the three schemes are presented. The effects of different synthesis schemes on the network complexity, hydrogen consumption, total annual cost and operational flexibility of hydrogen network with single period operation and multiple period operation are studied. Results show that the direct scheme can always obtain a hydrogen network with the least connections and the highest total annual cost, whereas the other two schemes enable to generate hydrogen networks with the lower hydrogen costs and similar total annual costs. In a single period operation, the operational flexibility of the network can be improved to a certain extent, which depends strongly on the utilization efficiency of hydrogen sources and the amount of hydrogen utilities available. However, in a multiperiod operation, the hydrogen networks with indirect scheme are superior to the hydrogen networks with other two schemes in enhancing the operational flexibility due to the increases of the actual capacity redundancy and additional control variables. This work is also expected to provide a useful guidance for optimal synthesis of hydrogen networks with the desired economic and operational performances. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work studied a system of single stage mixed-suspension-mixed-product-removal (MSMPR) crystallization with particle breakage controlled by wet milling. Conventional single stage MSMPR crystallizer is limited by its degrees of freedom, which makes the process performance largely depend on steady state crystallization rate only tunable by residence time and supersaturation. Breakage brought by wet milling is demonstrated in this work as a supersaturation-independent variable to manipulate steady state conditions. The simulation results show that wet milling can act as a promising process intensification tool that increases process yield and broadens attainable region of particle size. Breakage model is adopted from dry milling and incorporated to high resolution finite volume population balance model. Four cases that cover a wide range of nucleation and growth rates have been tested, and the process yield and particle size are studied as functions of residence time and wet milling tip speeds.

AB Microalgae are a sustainable rich source of high-added value metabolites, as omega-3 and carotenoids, for their ability to grow and accumulate these compounds also in wastewaters or in seawaters. Molecular distillation is a valid techinque respect to conventional distillation for fractionation of these thermosensitive products without affecting their nutritional and biological values. In this work a fractionation process using molecular distillation for separating fatty acids (in part omega-3) as esters and carotenoids from a microalgal lipidic extract, was designed and optimized. A Response Surface Method (RSM) analysis was carried out in order to find the optimal operative conditions of the molecular distiller in terms of temperature, pressure and purification ability. Furthermore, to complete the process scheme, also the design of the other equipments, including in particular the esterification reactor and the dewatering column, was done. In order to complete the feasibility study of the process, an estimation of the Operating Expense (OPEX) and Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), using the results of the simulations in terms of energy and utilities' consumption, was done. All of these informations, both technical and economical, will be the basis for future industrial implementations of the designed process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen production from air by membrane gas separation processes is a mature technology which is applied in numerous industrial sectors (chemical, food, aeronautics, space..). Depending on the nitrogen purity requirements (typically between 90 and 99.9%), single stage or multistage membrane process configurations are used. A very large number of advanced membrane materials have been recently reported, showing increasing permeability and/or selectivity for air separation applications (i.e. trade-off limits of dense polymeric materials for the O-2/N-2 gas pair) compared to the commercially available membranes. The interest of these new materials in terms of nitrogen production cost and their impact in terms of process configuration are reported through a process synthesis study. Based on a tailor made optimization methodology and program, the production cost and associated optimal process configuration are first identified for two standard O-2/N-2 separation membranes at four different levels of N-2 purity (90, 95, 99, 99.9%). The same strategy is then performed with advanced trade-off membrane materials, with the possibility to combine different materials in multistaged systems. The impact in terms of nitrogen production cost for the different purities and the corresponding optimal membrane materials and process configurations are discussed. Surprisingly, a medium membrane selectivity combined to a high permeability is shown to systematically offer the best set of performances, for mono or multistaged sys- tems. Vacuum operation and recycling loops are shown to generate lower N-2 production costs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Population balance equations (PBE) provide a suitable a framework for dealing with drop breakage and coalescence. In addition, modeling of the solid particle sedimentation process based on Kynch's theory has been successfully used and validated in mineral processing and wastewater treatment. In this work, we present a model that merges the coalescence process with hindered polydisperse sedimentation. The PBE model is projected onto a partial differential equation (PDE) system by discretizing the droplet volume. Because there is loss of mass in the system when the daughter droplets are greater than the larger species considered for the numerical solution, two terms that produce the conservation of the mass or total volume of the dispersed phase are incorporated into the PDE system. The resulting PDE system is split into two systems: homogeneous PDEs and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The homogeneous PDEs and the ODEs are discretized using a first-order central differencing scheme and the second-order, two-stage Runge-Kutta method, respectively. The model predicts the vertical variation of the composition of the dispersed phase layer that forms at the top or bottom of the gravity settler. The proposed model was calibrated and validated through an experiment with an oil and water system. In particular, simulations illustrate the effects of: the continuity of the dispersion (oil-in-water and water-in-oil) and the standard deviation of the initial droplet volumes on phase separation quality, as well as the influence of the coalescence frequency on the average droplet volume.

AB The purpose of this study was to employ Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to develop data-driven models that would enable the shrinking horizon nonlinear model predictive control of a computationally intensive stochastic multiscale system. The system of choice was a simulation of thin film formation by chemical vapour deposition. Two ANNs were trained to estimate the system's observables. The ANNs were subsequently employed in a shrinking horizon optimization scheme to obtain the optimal time-varying profiles of the manipulated variables that would meet the desired thin film properties at the end of the batch. The resulting profiles were validated using the stochastic multiscale system and a good agreement with the predictions of the ANNs was observed. Due to their observed computational efficiency, accuracy, and the ability to reject disturbances, the ANNs seem to be a promising approach for online optimization and control of computationally demanding multiscale process systems.

AB The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to renewable hydrocarbon fuels by solar energy is important in solving both energy and environmental problems. In this study, highly robust hybrid systems (H-Bi2WO6/MnP, F-Bi2WO6/MnP, and T-Bi2WO6/MnP) for visible-light reduction of CO2 to CO were developed. A Mn complex was anchored to Bi2WO6 particles via bisphosphonate functional groups. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction with this catalytic system under visible-light (lambda > 400 nm) irradiation was investigated. CO was the only product, i.e., no other products were detected in the present system. The addition of water or triethylamine significantly enhanced the CO2 conversion activity of the hybrid photocatalytic system. The addition of 25% (v/v) water enhanced the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency of H-Bi2WO6/MnP. A turnover number of 301 for 8 h was achieved, compared with 255 for F-Bi2WO6/MnP and 212 for T-Bi2WO6/MnP. The Mn complex played an important role in achieving highly selective conversion of CO2 to CO. A possible mechanism, namely a "Z-scheme", for CO2 reduction is proposed. These results confirm that the H-Bi2WO6 semiconductor is an essential component in our heterogeneous hybrid system. It effectively acts as a photosensitizer, an electron reservoir, and an electron transport mediator. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study describes an original colorimetric method to visualize and quantify the local oxygen mass transfer around a rising bubble in reactive media. This method is based on the use of a colorless bio-inspired copper complex, Cu(btmgp)I, specially tailored for the study, which, dissolved in acetonitrile, oxidizes into an orange copper-complex [Cu2O (2)(btmgp)(2)]I-2. The latter complex, unstable at ambient temperature, decays quite fast into two Cu(II) complexes, leaving a permanent pale-green color as final products. The flow investigated consists in a pure oxygen single bubble rising freely in a confined thingap cell (400 x 200 x 1 mm). A wide range of motion regimes for the bubbles are observed as the Archimedes number ranges from 860 < Ar < 18, 800 and the Reynolds number from 580 < Re < 8200. A high-resolution 16-bit sCMOS camera, combined with specific filters, is used to capture images from a region-of-interest of the cell, illuminated by a white LED backlight panel. An ad hoc calibration protocol is developed to correlate the grey-levels from the colored signal to the equivalent oxygen concentrations. This procedure then allows to measure indirectly the amount of oxygen transferred to the liquid phase. The series of images are also treated to identify the bubble motion and properties. Thanks to this method, equivalent oxygen concentration fields, gap-averaged and time-averaged, can be reached with high precision in the far-field wake of the bubbles, enabling thus to deeply characterize the mass transfer mechanisms under reactive conditions in such confined configuration, and to establish a dimensionless representation in terms of Sherwood number versus Peclet number. At last, thanks to the knowledge of the kinetic rate of the reaction and of the diffusion coefficients, the Hatta number and the enhancement factor are estimated, and thus the intrinsic Sherwood numbers; these results demonstrate that the enhancement of the mass transfer by the reactions involved with the copper-complexes is not negligible (almost 12-15%).

AB We present an investigation of the dynamics of calcium caseinate as a function of hydration, solvent isotope (H2O and D2O) and drying methods (roller drying and spray drying), using quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). These factors are key to the formation of fibres in this material which makes it a potential candidate as a next-generation meat analogue. Using a phenomenological model, we find that the relaxation times of the dry spray dried powder decrease with increasing temperatures, while they do not change for the roller dried powder. The spectra of the hydrated samples reveal two independent picosecond processes, both reflecting localized re-orientational motions. We hypothesize that the faster motion is due to the external protein groups that are hydrophilic and the slower motion is due to the internal groups that are hydrophobic. The solvent effect of D2O is not limited to the external groups but prevails to the internal groups where less protons are mobile compared to the H2O hydrated samples. Higher temperatures narrow the number difference in mobile protons, possibly by altering the weak interactions inside the protein aggregates. These findings suggest that a harsh and longer drying process contributes to less active protein side-groups and highlight the hydrophobic effect of D2O on the fibre formation in calcium caseinate.

ID WASTE-WATER; NANOPARTICLES; FLOCCULATION; AGGREGATION; REMOVAL
AB Microplastics have become a highly discussed topic: Whether through the decomposition of larger plastic waste or direct usage on a small particle scale, microplastics find their way into the natural ecosystem with uncertain consequences: In particular, the ingestion and therefore the introduction of these particles into the food web (often carrying adsorbed chemicals) poses still not fully understood hazards for mankind. This work focuses on the separation of such particles from aquatic suspensions and evaluates the viability of magnetic seeded filtration in this field. In this study it could be shown that it is generally possible to separate fine polymeric particles from dilute suspensions in a highly effective manner. A broad range of process conditions were investigated with separation efficiencies reaching up to 95%. The pH and ultimately the surface charge of the particles were identified to be the crucial process relevant parameters. More exactly, the surface potentials should be either small or oppositely charged leading to a diminishing or even attractive electrostatic interaction. However, when both agglomeration partners exhibit an electrostatic repulsion, a thorough parameter optimization nevertheless yielded high separation efficiencies. In particular, the ionic strength and magnetic seed concentration proved to be determining factors in this case. Lastly, the process kinetics were investigated and a limited exponential growth character was observed which could be modeled with basic equations from agglomeration theory under simplifying assumptions. This knowledge further assists the selection of an optimal parameter set for a process engineering application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increased attention towards continuous processes in, e.g. reaction or crystallization has put emphasis towards gas-liquid two-phase flow and especially towards slug flow. The segmentation leads to narrow residence time distributions under laminar flow conditions enabling the implementation of kinetically slow processes. Furthermore, mixing inside slugs is ensured without introduction of additional mixing devices. However, such internal mixing is affected by the slug length itself and its distribution formed during slug formation. Therefore, for uniform process conditions inside the slugs, they need to be as homogeneous as possible in length identifying slug formation as one of the crucial steps towards the design of slug flow reactors/crystallizers. In this study, the performance of slug flow with focus on slug lengths' homogeneity is quantified by evaluating characteristic values of a slug length distribution. For that, an automated image based quantification method is developed. Various inlet conditions, including the air supply and the geometry of mixer, are investigated regarding their influence on slug length distribution. Different mixer materials are compared such that finally an improved setup towards homogeneity of slug flow is defined. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the deposition mechanism of the outermost electroless nickel plating layer in a three-layer composite coatings on the magnesium alloy surface, the electroless nickel plating layers with six different plating times (3, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 90 min) were selected as research targets. The transformations in microcosmic morphology, element composition and material structure of the samples electrolessly plated at six different plating times were characterized by SEM. EDS and XRD. The changes in corrosion resistance of samples with different electroless plating times were measured by polarization curve. It was concluded that the nickel-phosphorus deposition process on the activation composite coatings was a "cell-like three-dimensional" growth judging from the microscopic morphology of coating surface obtained by SEM. The elemental changes obtained from the EDS were consistent with the growth of nickel cells obtained SEM. The XRD results showed that the diffraction peaks of nickel were not detected on the surface at an electroless plating time of 3 min. Nickel peaks appeared after 5 min of electroless plating, and the nickel peak width broadened and the intensity increased as the electroless plating time increased. The corrosion resistance is greatly improved when the electroless plating is performed for 60 min due to the complete nickel coating without defects as shown in the SEM. It can be concluded that the deposition mechanism of electroless plating on the double-layer active surface is an initial ecological reduction [H] autocatalytic reduction deposition process according to the micromorphology and structure of the samples electrolessly plated at six different plating times.

AB First-order partial differential equations are frequently applied for the simulation of adsorption and reaction processes. The numerous numerical methods available are typically applied without any further modifications despite of various well-known errors caused by, for example, numerical dissipation and crude approximations of certain phenomena. In this work, we analyzed a classical mixing cell model that is capable to simulate isothermal liquid chromatographic separation processes with incompressible mobile phases. This model corresponds to a 1D model of a chromatographic column discretized with a first-order finite volume method. It is our aim to counteract actively two errors, namely numerical dispersion (i.e. the second-order spatial derivative in truncation error) and partition inconsistency related to the nonlinear partition quantified by a competitive adsorption isotherm model. The new numerical method introduced in this article maintains characteristics of the first-order base scheme (non-oscillatory and conditionally stable) and offers enhanced accuracy (smaller numerical errors and improved description of shock waves). Furthermore, the method does not require solving the system of differential-algebraic equations that cause large matrix computations, but rather solves nonlinear equations 'cell-by-cell'. The numerical routines can be easily parallelized to accelerate computation time with multi-core CPUs. To test the method developed, four-zone simulated moving bed adsorption as a challenging example was considered, which causes dynamically changing complex concentration profiles by periodic operation using several columns.

AB The results of the recent experimental work performed by Butler et al. (2016, 2018) are analysed based on the dominant phenomena: (i) small scale convection by means of Taylor vortices in the liquid slugs and (ii) diffusion in lubrication film. A main result shown here is that the Taylor circulation frequency is able to reflect the global mass transfer rate in gas-liquid Taylor flow through an almost linear relationship, which emphasizes the interest of the circulating motion in the slug, and gives a very simple correlation to predict the k(L)a value (at large Schmidt number). A mechanism of flow behavior during the bubble formation at the T-mixer is proposed as a possible explanation of unexpected concentration areas (called "islands"). However, despite of these unusual concentration field structures in these cases, the mass transfer rate coefficient k(L)a is still accurately predicted by the Taylor circulation frequency in the slug.

AB Boron doped carbon nanotubes were synthesized using chemical vapour deposition using acetylene as carbon source, boric acid as boron source and Ferrocene/MgO as catalyst/support. Boric acid was directly used as a solid precursor for doping boron in the CNT lattice. A kinetic model was established by varying the temperature of the reactor, partial pressure of reactants, flow rates and catalyst concentration. The rate controlling steps were studied and the optimal reaction conditions were established so as to synthesize the desired quantity and quality of boron doped carbon nanotubes. Boron doping of 6.31-6.71 at.% was obtained. Two different mechanisms were found to control the rate of reaction at different range of temperatures. The activation energy for the two mechanisms was found to be 18.21 kJ/mol and 6.73 kJ/mol respectively. A mechanism was proposed and validated using the experimental data so as to understand the growth of B-CNTs. The synthesized B-CNTs were purified using concentrated hydrochloric acid and characterized by using SEM, TEM to understand the surface characteristics; FTIR and XPS to detect and quantify the boron present in the sample, Raman spectroscopy and TGA analysis to determine the purity of the product.

AB Flotation is a common physico-chemical solid-liquid separation technology. It is applied in classical fields like minerals processing, pulp deinking and wastewater treatment and novel fields like biotechnology. The success of flotation is influenced by flotation key parameters. The aim of this study was to present a set of small-scale screening methods for the key flotation parameters particle size, particle hydrophobicity, bubble size and direct particle-bubble interaction. Experiments were performed with the model microorganism S. cerevisiae. Flotation was done in complex fermentation media and in isotonic saline, at varying pH and after flocculant addition. The goal, to combine small-scale laboratory methods to explain, predict and optimize yeast flotation results was achieved. Combining the methods can be used prospectively for wide screening of potential flotation additives, such as collectors, frothers and flocculants and to optimize microorganism floatability.

AB Study on the gas hydrates in porous medium has great significance to the formation, accumulation and exploitation of natural gas hydrate (NGH). Consequently, we investigated the formation/dissociation of ethane hydrate in a sub-millimeter sized capillary in this work, and observed the appearance and kinetic rate during the hydrate formation/dissociation process. The dissociation equilibria of ethane hydrate in capillary was measured first, then the influences of hydrate memory effect (dissociation temperature and time) and degree of subcooling on ethane hydrate formation were obtained, respectively. The results demonstrate that hydrate forms more difficultly in capillary than in conventional macro-reactor because of the fluid resistance effect and poor mass transfer of gas-liquid. The appearance and formation kinetics of ethane hydrate are greatly influenced by the memory effect and subcooling degree. The morphology of ethane hydrate formation on the bubble surface in water bulk phase shows that "bridge effect" occurs during the hydrate formation and growth in capillary. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As the clean fuel additives, polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (DMMn) could significantly reduce carbonaceous particulate matters and volatile organic pollutants in the exhaust gas. Large scale production in a green route would be crucial if the DMMn tailored diesel was applied to the abatement of widespread PM air pollution. In the production, heavy components usually should be separated, recycled, decomposed and re-reacted to gain the aimed products, which would significantly increase complexity and energy consumption of the process. And fatally, it also might cause blockage of units and pipelines. In this work, to prevent blockage, the facile and robust process producing DMMn was conceptually designed basing on physicochemical properties researches. The process exempting from recycle of heavy components and de-heavy column was proposed according to cold-flow properties. Both energy consumption and fixed capital investment can be saved. The reaction kinetic model, which was described in the form of power law functions, showed good consistency for both propagation and depolymerization reactions. Flash points of diesel blends were also measured for determining specification of light components. This work shows it is feasible that DMMn can be produced from dimethoxy methane and trioxane in the presence of acid functionalized ionic liquids in large scale. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The dissolution behavior of polymers in CO2 has become increasingly important to the applications of CO2 in industry. Experimental results showed that PVAc could be dissolved in CO2 at a high pressure. When cosolvents such as ethanol, acetic acid, and ethyl acetate were present in the system, the transition points could be decreased with the increase in cosolvent concentration. In this work, the influence mechanisms of cosolvents on dissolution behaviors of PVAc in supercritical CO2 were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation methods. First, the cohesive energy and solubility parameters of PVAc, cosolvents and CO2 were analyzed. Compared with CO2, the mixtures of CO2 and cosolvents have closer solubility parameters with PVAc to enhance the dissolubility of PVAc within them. Moreover, the mechanism of PVAc dissolution in CO2 and the effects of cosolvents on decreasing the transition points were investigated. The Lewis acid-Lewis base (LA-LB) interactions between 0 atoms in PVAc and C atoms in CO2 are the main influencing factors of PVAc dissolution in CO2. The presence of cosolvent can generate new interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and LA-LB interactions, which have different influences on the LA-LB interactions between PVAc and CO2. Ethanol and ethyl acetate have no great influence on these LA-LB interactions, while acetic acid exerts considerable influence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To gain an insight into the effect of fluidization behavior of particles on the characteristic of plasma in a plasma-enhanced spouted bed, we investigated the changes of plasma optical emission spectroscopy (OES) with fluidized particles in this paper. Fluidization experiments under the irradiation of a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma generator were performed in a two-dimensional spouted bed. Essential operation parameters, such as particle type, applied voltage, gas velocity, and particle number were changed. The pressure drop of particles, emission intensity (El) of plasma, and high-speed camera images of plasma pattern were measured. As the results, the fluidization behavior of particles had been changed by the plasma irradiation, especially for polypropylene (PP) particles. The emission spectra of argon (Ar) plasma had been changed significantly with particles. The emission intensities of the Ar I transition lines were increased, and Ar II lines were decreased with PP particles compared to the case of no particle. The emission intensity of Ar I lines was enhanced with the applied voltage regardless of the addition of particles. The emission intensity changed with a gas velocity versus particle numbers was identified with the fluidization behavior, that emission intensity was increased at first and then decreased. The gas velocities corresponded to the highest value of emission intensity with various particle number were similar to the trend of the changes of minimum spouted velocity. The electrical conductivity and color of particles may affect the difference of pressure drop and detected emission intensity for two kinds of particles. Our research extends the knowledge of the relationship between fluidization behavior and plasma optical characteristic. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) allows for the in situ tracking of particles (rocks, balls, slurry) in experimental tumbling mills. For sufficiently long tracking times, the trajectory fields can be cast into time averages per unit volume of kinematic and dynamical information which constitute the key ingredients for fundamental modelling of tumbling mills. Central to this objective is the accurate delineation of geometric features making up the tumbling mill in the azimuthal plane. To this end, algorithms for extracting bulk features of the media (free surface, equilibrium surface, centre of circulation, toe and shoulder positions) are presented. These algorithms are then employed to compare results from dry, batch experiments spanning a wide range of mill speeds, lifter heights and lifter angles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diverse and cost-effective polyamide stirrers, printed by fused deposition modeling, were used in a 0.5 L reaction calorimeter (Mettler Toledo RC1e) to principally investigate the suitability and performance of 3D-printed stirrers. Thermal-initiated batch emulsion copolymerizations of styrene and butyl acrylate were successfully carried out with monomer contents between 20 and 40 wt% and temperatures in the range of 60 to 85 degrees C. Further, precisely adjusted stirrers were designed and fabricated based on a constant volume related power input for scale-up processes in a 10 L batch reactor. This scale-manufacturing concept enables a time-effective and inexpensive access to versatile and tailor-made 3D-printed stirrers, even for the implementation in already existing reaction systems. Inline turbidity was used as online monitoring tool to detect the mixing characteristics and control the course of emulsion polymerization processes. Analytical results of the 10 L resembled those of the 0.5 L scale and proved our main objective to produce comparable droplet dispersions (+/- 2 nm). The resulting emulsions from 0.5 and 10 L scale were stable with Zeta potential values down to -90 mV. Neither product adhesion on nor deformation of the 3D-printed stirrers were found even at higher temperatures, monomer contents or scale-up processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several design features were investigated such as diameter of inlet pipe, vane design, separator vessel diameter. In addition the effect of liquid rate was examined. The study finds that pipe diameter, column diameter, liquid rate and fluid properties of the inlet vane affect separation efficiencies. This is a result of several different fluid mechanical processes which affect the droplet size distribution into the separation vessel. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The kinetics of cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is significantly modulated by the resistances for transport of reactants to the catalytic sites offered by different components of the fuel cell. This modulation governs the polarization curve of the PEMFC. Consequently, the various operating, geometric and material parameters of the fuel cell dictate the polarization curve. The effects of these parameters on the polarization curve over the entire range of current density, from zero to limiting current, can be predicted using detailed numerical simulations, which are however expensive. Analytical models, although simple can capture the essential details of physico-chemical processes occurring inside a PEMFC and are significantly inexpensive. In this article, we derive an analytical equation of the polarization curve which is valid over the entire range of current density. Specifically, the representative situation of a humidified low temperature PEMFC is considered wherein oxygen transport resistance in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) is encountered at lower current density than proton transport resistance in the CCL. A novel experimental methodology is illustrated to confirm that this is indeed the case. Next, we elucidate a procedure to determine in-situ oxygen diffusion coefficients in the various domains of an operational PEMFC. Finally, it is shown that the analytical polarization curve predicted using these parameters is in excellent agreement with the experimental and numerically simulated polarization curves over the entire range of current density. The significance of this work is that the analytical model relates the performance of a PEMFC to all operating and geometric parameters as well as the average transport and kinetic properties of the materials used in its different components, without the need for computationally expensive numerical simulations. The model can therefore provide useful insights for enhancing the performance of PEMFC in different regimes of current density as well as for diagnostic purposes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fine control of the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is challenging due to complex process dynamics. Rate of conversion of cellulose to valuable monomeric products is often significantly slowed down after an initial rapid but short-lived phase. Underlying mechanisms for this process have yet to be fully understood and as a result poorly represented in existing models. Here, we propose a new modelling platform termed Multi-Layered Population Balance Model (ML-PBM), which enables various key aspects of cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis occurring over the entire breakdown process to be captured. As a core component for predicting the slowdown phenomenon, the ML-PBM properly accounts for heterogeneity in cellulose crystallinity and chain lengths across the structural layers of cellulose particles with different morphologies. Beyond a decent quantitative fit to highly nonlinear dynamic experimental data collected across different conditions, the ML-PBM reveals that the rate slowdown phenomenon is potentially due to heterogeneity in cellulose properties coupled with cellulose morphology. Equipped with the unification of various process fundamentals, the ML-PBM is a rational framework with the potential to facilitate sound cellulose engineering. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Supercritical water fluidized bed is a promising reactor for the industrial application of the technology of supercritical water gasification of coal. In this work, a numerical model of lignite gasification in SCWFB considering flow, heat transfer and gasification reaction was established, and the Euler-Lagrange method and RNG k-epsilon model were used. Through this model, the multi-field distribution characteristics and developing rules were studied under wide temperature range. A low-temperature zone with uneven circumferential temperature distribution was found below the feed inlet, and the average residence time decreased with the increase of reactor temperature. Steam reforming of solid residual carbon was the bottleneck of complete gasification, and the alkali salt catalyst can accelerate its reaction rate and cause the reaction zone to move to the lower fluidization section. Besides, the simulated results show that the extension of the reactor length was an effective means to improve the carbon gasification efficiency, and the increase of the feed inlet height can avoid the blockage of distributor. Based on both the catalyst addition and reactor structure optimization, a scheme was proposed where the complete gasification of lignite at 750 degrees C was achieved with H-2 promotion promoted.

AB Because amide groups can be easily hydrolyzed to carboxyl groups at high temperature, polyacrylamide (PAM) and its derivatives cannot be applied to high temperature and salinity reservoirs. To solve this problem, a new kind of surface modified nanosilica with different functional groups, including amine and octyl groups, was prepared in this article. Benefiting from its structure, the viscosity of the nanosilica/polymer solution increased by 26.08% when the degree of hydrolysis was high (degree of hydrolysis 47.5%, to simulate the HPAM solution after experiencing long-term flooding), whereas the viscosity of the nanosilica/polymer solution only increased by 0.26% when the degree of hydrolysis was low (degree of hydrolysis 17.8%, to simulate the HPAM solution at the beginning of polymer flooding). In core flooding experiments, the polymer/nanosilica hybrid solution exhibited a higher oil recovery factor (17.30%) than the polymer solution (5.00%). Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) mechanisms were systematically investigated by carrying out rheological measurements, visualization tests of polymer flooding, and interfacial activity and long-term stability analyses. The excellent performance of the nanosilica/polymer solution could be attributed to the high interfacial activity of nanosilica and the strong electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between nanosilica and polymer chains. These results indicate that the nanosilica/polymer hybrid solution could be an effective oil-displacing agent. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Ca2+-(NH4)(2)CO3-(NH4)(2)WO4-NH3-H2O system is a typical system in tungsten extractive metallurgy used in the preparation and purification of ammonium tungstate solution. To determine an appropriate solution composition to optimize these processes, a thermodynamic model combined with the Pitzer activity equations was developed. This model allowed us to predict the dependence of the equilibrium WO3 concentration on the compositions of the solution in the Ca2+-(NH4)(2)CO3-(NH4)(2)WO4-NH3-H2O system. Thermodynamic analyses clarified the stable regions of CaCO3 and CaWO4 in the Ca2+-(NH4)(2)CO3-(NH4)(2)WO4-NH3-H2O system and indicated that increasing both the total NH3 and total CO2 concentrations is beneficial for increasing the equilibrium WO3 concentration. The experimental results confirm that the thermodynamic model offers a means of predicting the equilibrium concentrations of species in the system. Furthermore, the equilibrium WO3 concentrations of the solution of the Ca2+-(NH4)(2)CO3-(NH4)(2)WO4-NH3-H2O system at 298.15 K have been predicted at different total CO2 concentrations, as well as different total NH3 to total CO2 concentration ratios. Thus, the findings of this study will not only help determine the appropriate composition of the leaching system for preparing ammonium tungstate solutions, but also provide a reference for purifying ammonium tungstate solutions.

AB Hollow-fiber membrane humidifiers were used in solar-assisted and membrane-based air humidification-dehumidification desalination systems (SMHDD) because of their greater packing density and thus better transfer efficiency. A dynamic mathematical model containing the major components of this system was established, including the membrane humidifier, dehumidifier and solar heating unit. The model was validated with test data from an experimental platform where three kinds of membranes with different membrane thickness, heat conductivity, etc., were tested. To understand the role of membrane characteristics in the proposed desalination system, the effects of the membrane moisture diffusivity (D-m), heat conductivity (lambda(m)), membrane thickness (delta(m)) and membrane area (A(tot)) on the system performance were analyzed numerically. Of the three factors, D-m and A(tot) show the most significant effect on the accumulated freshwater production (AP) and coefficient of performance (COP), and the effects of delta(m) on the system performance are far less pronounced than that of D-m and delta(m). In summary, membranes with higher moisture diffusivity and smaller thickness can improve system performance without much attention to the heat conductivity. However, further raising D-m above 3.0 x 10(6) m(2)/s has a slight benefit to the performance improvement. Findings in this paper are useful in guiding the preparation of membranes used for application-scale membrane-based desalination systems operating in real-world environmental conditions.

AB Self-limiting gas-surface reactions lead to reaction fronts that penetrate nanoporous materials with a finite speed. We present a closed form theoretical model, validated against molecular simulations, that shows the influence of the fractal scaling law on the time needed to fully penetrate fractal agglomerates of nanoparticles. For very large agglomerate sizes, this penetration time scales with the number of particles N in the agglomerate as NDf-1/Df. The penetration time for agglomerates with fractal dimensions D-f < 3 may therefore be orders of magnitude smaller than for non-fractal porous materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a kinetic and thermodynamic study of CO2 absorption in blends of monoethanolamine (MEA) and potassium lysinate (K-Lys) solutions was carried out at low CO2 partial pressures and temperatures (303-323 K). The CO2 loading capacity, density and viscosity of MEA + K-Lys solutions were measured. A modified Kent-Eisenberg model was applied to predict the CO2 loading capacity and also to determine the reaction equilibrium constants for the MEA + K-Lys system. The results showed that the model predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. In order to study the reaction kinetics between CO2 and the MEA + K-Lys solution, the values of the reaction rate constant, the overall reaction kinetic constant, reaction order, physical solubility and CO2 diffusivity were determined. Finally, the absorption performance of the MEA + K-Lys system was compared with other common CO2 absorbents in terms of absorption heat, CO2 loading capacity and absorption rate. It was found that MEA + K-Lys has a better performance compared to other absorbents which makes it an attractive alternative to alkanolamines for CO2 capture. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Silica nanoparticles (NPs) have shown tremendous application potential as stabilising agents in foams. The adsorption of cationic surfactants on the surface of NPs through electrostatic interactions forms integrated surfactant-NP compounds and endows the NPs with surfactancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the alkane chain length of cationic surfactants on NP surfactancy and foam stability. The results demonstrate that the surface tension decreases and dilational elasticity modulus increases with surfactant chain length. Simultaneously, coalescence of bubbles is markedly suppressed and the stability of surfactant-NP foams is enhanced in static and dynamic tests. With a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation (CGMD), it was found that the surfactant-NP complexes evolve into an asymmetric Janus structure at the gas-liquid interface from their symmetric configuration in the aqueous phase. In addition, the resistance force during the pulling of a NP away from the interface increases with surfactant chain length. The simulation results imply that surfactant-NPs have a high surfactancy and the adsorption stability is improved with increasing surfactant chain length, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.

AB Dynamics of elastic droplet breakup and stretching of polymeric filaments in a microfluidic T-junction are investigated experimentally. Through comparisons between cases of Newtonian droplet and a series of viscoelastic droplets with similar shear viscosity, the effect of elasticity on breakup dynamic of droplet is especially focused. Four sequential stages of droplet breakup in a microfluidic T-junction are observed: (I) squeezing, (II) transition, (III) pinch-off and (IV) filament rupture stages. For former three stages (I-III), dynamic behaviors of viscoelastic droplets with lower molecular weight (M w = 1 x 10(5) g/mol and 3 x 10(5) g/mol) and Newtonian droplet are similar, while for viscoelastic droplet with higher molecular weight (M-w =1 x 10(6) g/mol), the spatial obstruction of previous filaments accelerates the shrinkage of droplet neck. Additionally, the transformation of dominant force from inertial to capillary force leads to the variation of scaling laws describing the neck evolution. For filament rupture stages (IV), with extension of polymer molecules chain, the elastocapillary balance contributes to the exponential thinning of the polymeric filament, while the width of thread neck decreases linearly with the time for Newtonian droplet. Furthermore, more effort has been devoted to investigate the stretching dynamic of filament. The stretching rate of filament is independent of elasticity, but proportional to two-phase flow rates.

AB Experiments and theory concern the behaviour of a small bubble carried through an orifice by a very viscous liquid. The liquid was polybutene oil, of viscosity about 70 Pa s, i.e. 70,000 times that of water. The Reynolds number of the flow is substantially less than one, hence the flow pattern is approximately radial flowing into, and away from, the orifice. These flow patterns have profound effects on the shape of an entrained bubble. On the upstream side, the acceleration of the liquid, as it approaches the orifice, causes elongation of the bubble since the front of the bubble moves faster than the back. On the downstream side, the reverse occurs: the back of the bubble moves fast than the front. Thus the height of the bubble diminishes as it moves away from the orifice, leading to the formation of a 'crescent-moon' shape. The shape of these bubbles can be predicted by considering the motion of a droplet of the same liquid replacing the bubble: the resulting geometric theory gives good predictions of bubble deformation approaching the orifice and of 'crescent-moon' formation downstream of the orifice.

AB This experimental study investigated the patterns and characteristics of the liquid sheet formed by two axial misaligned colliding jets and two colliding jets with different velocities. The tests were limited to the low Reynolds number region, 100 < Re < 400, of two Newtonian colliding jets (a glycerol-water mixture). This range of Reynolds number includes the triple-chain, double-chain, closed-rim, and open-rim regimes. In the case of misaligned collision, it was found that an open-rim pattern, called trigonous liquid sheet, was formed for a specific measured degree of skewness in the triple-chain, double-chain, and closed-rim regimes. In the case of colliding with different velocities, two effects were observed, including the rotation of the liquid sheet in the direction of the jets axis and the deformation of the liquid sheet. A cancer-like instability, similar to what has been observed in two identical viscoelastic colliding jets, was also captured in the central region of the liquid sheet in the case of different velocities. This instability confirmed the sheet-driven mechanism of the fishbone pattern formation. In addition, the quantitative measurement of the geometrical characteristics of the liquid sheet and the droplets size distribution of the fishbone pattern were comprehensively discussed for different Reynolds numbers, skewness factors, and velocity ratios in the cases of two misaligned jets and different velocities of the two jets.

AB The direct desulfurization (DDS) mechanisms of DBT and 4,6-DMDBT over the different Co-promoted and Ni-promoted MoS2 corner sites were systematically investigated using DFT calculations. Innovatively, the adsorption processes of both sulfur-containing compounds were evaluated by dispersion corrected methods (DFT-D) firstly. After that, the effect of corner vacancy on the direct desulfurization mechanism was discussed in detail. And the results showed that single corner vacancy provided sufficient support for the DDS reaction of DBT, while double corner vacancies revealed necessary for the adsorption and subsequent C-S bond scission of 4,6-DMDBT. However, based on the DFT calculations, the formation energy of the double vacancies was relatively high, which was considered to be present at a very low possibility under the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) condition, thus the DDS activity of 4,6-DMDBT was relatively low. Compared to CoMoS, it could also be found that the corner vacancy of NiMoS showed more superiorities, not only in the contributions to the C-S bond cleavages of DBT and 4,6-DMDBT but also in the generation and regeneration processes of active sites. Consequently, the barriers of C-S bond cleavages over NiMoS corner sites were as low as 1.16 and 1.22 eV for DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, respectively. Furthermore, the formation energy of the single corner vacancy over NiMoS was 0.78 eV. The relative DFT researches provided atomic-scale insights into the catalytic cycle and the role of corner vacancy in the HDS reaction on Co/Ni-promoted catalysts, which were of significance for the design of highly active Mo-based HDS catalysts.

AB The diffusion in the multicomponent mixture of molecules coadsorbed on a surface with a square symmetry of the adsorption sites is investigated in the framework of a lattice gas model by a theoretical approach and the Monte Carlo simulations. Using the approach based on the theory of the non-equilibrium statistical operator I have derived the systems of equations describing the diffusion of the molecules in the Fickian and Onsager forms and obtained the analytical expressions for the Fickian diffusivities. These expressions are derived taking into account the lateral interactions between the molecules and the interactions of the activated molecules in the saddle points of the lattice potential relief with their surroundings. The diffusion equations in the Fickian representation exactly coincide with the corresponding classical counterparts, but the Onsager-like transport equations differ from their standard lore. In the new Onsager representation the migration of the diffusants is controlled only by the gradients of their own chemical potentials and the cross terms are absent. The Monte Carlo simulations have been used to test the correctness of the new expressions. There is a very good coincidence between the analytical and numerical data in the whole coverage region and in the wide range of the lateral interactions. The lateral interactions substantially influence on the behavior of the thermodynamic quantities and the Fickian diffusivities. These results demonstrate that the classical description in the Onsager presentation is not universal and cannot be applied for some lattice gas systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports an experimental and computational study on the shape and motion of an air bubble, contained in a highly viscous Newtonian liquid, as it passes through a rectangular channel having a con- striction orifice. The magnitude of the viscosity ratios, lambda, and capillary numbers, Ca, explored is high: 5.5 x 10(5) < lambda < 3.9 x 10(6) and 2.9 < Ca < 35.9 respectively. A multipass rheometer is used for the experimental work: air bubbles are suspended in 10 Pa s and 70 Pa s polybutene viscosity standards and passed through an orifice-plate geometry constructed within an optical flow-cell. High levels of bubble distortion are observed, including bubbles that resemble 'crescent moons'. Simulation work is carried out using an implementation of the volume of fluid method in the freely-available finite-volume computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM. Quantitative data pertaining to the motion and shape of the bubble was extracted from both the experimental and simulation work. Initially, a good match between numerical simulation and experimental work could not be obtained: this problem was alleviated by changing the viscosity averaging method from an arithmetic mean to a logarithmically-weighted arithmetic mean. Medium- and high-resolution simulations using this new viscosity averaging method were able to match experimental data with coefficients of determination, R-2, typically 0.898 < / R-2 < 0.985.

AB Mineral dissolution flows in porous media occur in numerous industrial and natural processes. We investigate the effects of varying rock-liquid interface on mineral dissolution transport in porous media. The one-dimensional mineral-dissolution flow problem that accounts for varying reacting interface and porosity is essentially non-linear. However, a novel exact solution is derived. The exact solution reveals a four-zone structure of the flow pattern with typical mineral concentration curves in all zones. The exact solution allows for a simplified inverse solver, facilitating determination of the surface function from laboratory reactive flow tests. Accounting for surface area evolution in the governing system of equations allows for significant improvement of matching the experimental data if compared with the constant-surface model. Moreover, the comparison between the analytical model and laboratory data reveals high agreement. The values of equilibrium mineral concentration as obtained from the matching and by thermodynamic calculations exhibit close agreement. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A horizontal soap film is established in vertical tube a few centimetres in diameter. A metal sphere, 1-2 mm diameter, is dropped onto the film, whose distortion is observed by means of a high speed camera. The film wraps partly around the sphere, detaching at a circle which moves up the sphere as it falls.
   The shape of the film at successive radii, bigger than the radius of contact, was predicted from theory relying on the proposition that if both sides of the film are open to atmosphere, there can be no pressure difference across it. The pressure difference across a film is proportional to (surface tension)/(radius of curvature); hence it follows that the radii of curvature in two planes, perpendicular to each other and to the film surface, must be equal and opposite. This proposition gives equations predicting the shape, in reasonable agreement with experiment.
   This theory is compared with the theory of catenoids, first studied by Euler in 1744. Catenoid theory gives exactly the same results as the 'radius of curvature' theory presented here. A simple energy conservation argument shows that the two theories are compatible and agree with a published photograph of a soap film catenoid. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB D-fructose hydrogenation in aqueous phase, at 373 K and 40 bar, was performed using monometallic and bimetallic Cu-Ni/SiO2 catalysts prepared by precipitation-deposition at controlled pH, without any type of co-catalysts and/or additives in solution. The precursors and catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 physisorption at 77 K, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, temperature programmed desorption of H-2 (H-2-TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The characterization of the mono and bimetallic samples showed that metal phase is composed of nanoparticles highly dispersed on SiO2 surface. It was also found evidence that a Cu-Ni like-alloy forms in the bimetallic sample. Precisely, the best catalytic performance was obtained with the bimetallic catalyst. This was attributed to a synergistic effect between Cu and Ni, favored by the intimate contact between both elements, which was reached from the Cu-Ni coprecipitation at controlled pH over SiO2. In a three cycles experiment performed with CuNi/SiO2, partial catalyst deactivation was observed. The original activity could be recovered by ex-situ reduction under H-2 flow. By temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), it was found that this deactivation is due to surface carbon species strongly chemisorbed on the metallic phase. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a novel approach for the single-step, continuous aerosol synthesis of blue, oxygen-deficient titania in a hot-wall reactor operated under reducing conditions by adding hydrogen. The precursor titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide is evaporated in a bubbler and consecutively carried into the reactor by a nitrogen stream where it undergoes thermal decomposition. According to X-ray diffraction analysis, several reduced titania states, among them the Magneli phases Ti4O7 and Ti5O9, are formed via the intermediates anatase and rutile. By slight modifications in the reactor setup both nanoparticles in the size range from 20 to 50 nm with high surface area and well-defined spherical submicron particles of 100 to 160 nm diameter can be produced. In particular, crystallographically phase-pure Ti4O7 is formed at high reactor temperatures. The presented synthesis process is scalable and poses an attractive alternative for the multi-step synthesis of oxygen deficient titania nanoparticles that is currently done via batch-wise annealing. Such nanoparticles are attractive material in the field of photocatalysis. They can be used for both water splitting to produce hydrogen and the decomposition of organic pollutants.

AB We report the formation of hollow and solid carbon spheres and spherical nanostructures by self-assembly through thermal stressing of jet fuel (Jet A-1) in the autoxidation temperature range. The characterization of Jet A-1 deposits was conducted by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Additionally, high resolution mass spectrometry with electro spray ionization source (ESI-MS) have been used to identify large molecular weight compounds in the mass range 350 Da to 1000 Da in the thermally stressed fuel. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis revealed oxygenated functional groups in the jet fuel treated by flask tests. Compositional analysis of deposit by TEM EDS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector identified multiple trace metallic elements such as Cu, Fe, Zn, Sn, Mg, Al and heteroatoms S, N, 0. Hollow carbon sphere formation was due to the catalytic activity of trace metals. Spherical particle growth in this method also appeared to follow Ostwald ripening mechanism. Simple flask static tests in the low temperature regime with jet fuel as hydrocarbon source without externally added catalysts thus is a novel method for hollow and solid carbon sphere synthesis and presented in this paper.

AB Computational simulations of cellulosic-biomass enzymatic hydrolysis using a computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) model coupled to a chemical-kinetics model are presented in this work. A time-step sub-cycling strategy was used to circumvent large disparities in time scales with respect to transport physics and chemical kinetics. The unknown reaction and transport parameters in the mathematical model were first fit to two canonical experiments: a well-mixed case that was limited by reaction kinetics and a settled-solids case that was limited by transport. The model was then validated against a benchtop experiment for an intermediate-mixing scenario, for which simulation results were in reasonable agreement with experimentally measured cellulose conversions. Settling of cellulose particles and diffusion of enzymes determine overall conversion rates for lower mixing rates, while reaction rates dominate conversion at higher mixing rates for which greater homogenization of substrates is achieved.

AB Supported catalysts are widely used in many industries. Manufacturing these catalysts is complex and manufacturing processes are influenced by many interdependent parameters. Although the performance and activity of catalysts are the most critical properties, their structures and design are also critical to their effectiveness. Previous work has shown that drying of catalysts can lead to the redistribution of metal and this in turn can affect the performance of the catalyst. At the same time, drying processes are often designed and scaled up by trial-and-error so it is desirable to have predictive models of the drying process. Previous experimental and modeling work has shown how the adsorption (of metal on the catalyst support) can significantly influence metal distributions at lower concentrations. It was also observed that at higher concentrations, adsorption was no longer the controlling factor, and solution properties began to control the metal distribution characteristics. Solution properties like density, viscosity, surface tension and volume ratio of metal all change as the metal concentration increases and these properties can in turn affect the distribution of metal during drying. In previous work, a drying model was developed that takes into account six different parameters to account for changes in solution properties as the concentration of metal increased. In this work, we carry out a parametric analysis, for nickel nitrate hexahydrate on a gamma-alumina support, to investigate the relative importance of these parameters in accounting for metal redistribution during drying at high concentrations. A detailed analysis on each of the solution parameters, in terms of the drying rate and redistribution of metal, showed that only three of the parameters were important: the volume ratio of metal, the vapor pressure, and the solubility of the metal in the solution. Based on this, we have created a reduced parameter model with fewer parameters. This model can be used for different metal precursors without doing multiple expensive and time-consuming experiments. We tested this reduced parameter model using a new metal precursor (cobalt nitrate hexahydrate) on the same support, and modeling and experimental results for the new metal precursor are presented in this paper. We show that the reduced parameter model does not show appreciably different results from the more complex drying model and the results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results.

AB Heat transfer in gas-solid flows has been numerically investigated via an immersed boundary-thermal lattice Boltzmann method. Stationary random assemblies of spheres are adopted in the simulations. The effect of particle velocity fluctuations whose magnitude is represented by the so-called granular temperature is accounted for by implementing velocity fluctuations obeying the isotropic Maxwellian distribution on spheres. It is found that particle fluctuations enhance the heat transfer between the gas and solid phases. This enhancement increases with increasing granular temperature-based Reynolds number and becomes less significant as the particle Reynolds number and the solid volume fraction increase. It is also found that the Nusselt numbers on individual particles follow the Log-Normal distribution at both zero and finite granular temperature conditions. The long tail of this distribution is caused by the existence of a non-negligible portion of the domain with fast local gas velocities that could significantly promote heat transfer.

AB Bubble and droplet entrainment plays an important role in the mass transfer between the liquid film and the gas core in churn and annular flow. In this work, bubble and droplet entrainments in vertical churn and annular flows are systematically studied in an air-water two-phase vertical flow experiment using a high-speed camera. The results show that there are three kinds of bubble entrainment and five kinds of droplet entrainment in churn and annular flows. The entrainment can be categorized as primary entrainment and secondary entrainment. The primary entrainment includes one kind of bubble entrainment, which is a large wave roll and overturn, and three kinds of droplet entrainment, which are shearing-off of waves containing bubbles, bag break-up of waves, and ligament break-up of waves. The secondary entrainment includes two kinds of bubble entrainment, which are synchronized bubble entrainment along with droplet entrainment and droplets from the gas core impacting the liquid film, and two kinds of droplet entrainment, which are droplets impacting the liquid film and the burst of bubbles. With the flow pattern transition from churn to annular flow, the dominant bubble entrainment changes from large wave roll and overturn to the synchronized bubble entrainment along with droplet entrainment accompanied by a decreasing intensity. The dominant droplet entrainment changes from shearing-off of waves containing bubbles to ligament break-up of waves with the intensity first decreasing and then increasing. There is a close relationship between bubble entrainment and droplet entrainment. The entrained bubbles reduce the strength of large-scale waves and facilitate the shearing-off of waves. A small number of droplets are entrained due to the burst of residual bubbles in the liquid film. Droplets that are generated by bag or ligament break-up of waves can directly impact the nearby liquid film, leading to synchronous bubble entrainment. A small number of bubbles can be entrapped by droplets from the gas core impacting the liquid film. The primary entrainment intensity is significantly greater than that of the secondary entrainment. With the transition from churn to annular flow, the change in the primary entrainment intensity determines the variety of the secondary entrainment intensity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Model-based design of chemical reactors via dynamic optimization can be performed using a recently developed approach called Multi-Level Reactor Design (MLRD). As a start, the MLRD method, its extensions and applications over the last ten years are reviewed compactly. In the main part of this contribution, a further extension to the model framework applied within this method allowing for the rigorous consideration of intrapellet transport processes in heterogeneously catalyzed systems is introduced. Accordingly, a system of coupled differential equations describing the mass and energy balance of both, reactor and catalyst pellet is set up. Balance equations are kept strictly distinguished from kinetic approaches, leaving the latter to be easily exchangeable. This leads to a multimodular model structure used to incorporate different models for diffusion flux, heat transport and pressure drop. The type of the extended model structure is "pseudoheterogeneous", i.e., the domain in which chemical reactions take place is shifted from a commonly applied pseudohomogeneous mixed phase to the catalyst interior while a solid phase on reactor scale is not modelled. Applying the extended and modularized method to methanol synthesis as a case study reveals considerable concentration and temperature gradients inside the catalyst. These are neglected implicitly in pseudohomogeneous approaches which can lead to a violation of the allowed range of operating conditions for a given catalyst. The extended MLRD model framework using a pseudoheterogeneous model overcomes this drawback and allows for apparatus independent reactor design while meeting process specific constraints in both the bulk gas and the catalyst phase. Further, a systematic investigation applying 27 combinations of diffusion flux, heat transport and pressure drop models reveals that a certain performance can be reached with any combination, while the deduced reactor design differs significantly.

AB A mesh-type dimensionally stable anode (DSA) consisting of ruthenium and iridium with low catalyst loading was prepared as an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst in acidic and alkaline media. The electrodeposition (ED) conditions, i.e., applied current density and total cycle number, and ED solutions with different precursor ratios of ruthenium to iridium are examined to fabricate various DSAs with a uniform thickness, and the effect of the iridium content on the catalytic activity is investigated. Among various DSA electrodes, the DSA electrode without iridium exhibits the highest activity and stability in the acidic medium owing to the high ratio of ruthenium. Conversely, the DSA electrode obtained using the ED solution with the ratio of 8:2 exhibits the highest performance in the alkaline medium. This is because the DSA electrode without iridium showed low stability, which is attributed to the dissolution of ruthenium oxide in the alkaline medium. In addition, two large-scale DSA electrodes optimized in the acidic and alkaline electrolytes show excellent performance, indicating the feasibility of the application of this electrode in practical electrolysis.

AB Nonlinear stability analysis that is based on a numerical phase portrait is performed to investigate excursive instability, which is a type of Ledinegg instability, under a constant external driving force. The lumped parameter system model consists of time-dependent nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and the dynamic analysis from the lumped model agrees well with the results of previous research. A global phase portrait of excursive instability is constructed in the phase space of mass flux vs. pressure drop. The trajectories in the phase portrait accurately describe the excursive process. An initiation boundary that passes through OFI, the maximum point of the internal characteristic curve and the unstable equilibrium solution is observed and developed with a versatile expression for each operating condition. The critical margin of the perturbation intensities is quantitatively determined by the initiation boundary to evaluate the effects of perturbation intensities on the system stability. The results demonstrate that the effects of small and large perturbation intensities are different. Although a system can maintain stability under small perturbations, flow instability possibly occurs with large perturbations imposed on the system. In addition, the hysteresis phenomenon in the system with two parallel channels is observed under a constant external driving force. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dynamic Shear Enhanced (DSE) membrane modules have been established as effective replacement of classical cross flow devices, especially in treatment of high fouling feed solutions. Nevertheless, even with latest modifications, no DSE module is able to regenerate permeate flux without intermittent chemical/ hydrodynamic membrane cleaning. In this article, we have presented the design, performance characterization and primary CFD modeling of a DSE module with rapid on-line membrane washing facility along with high permeate production rate even in treatment of extremely fouling feed solution. Present device, named as Intermeshed Spinning Basket Membrane (ISBM) module, consists of two intermeshed counter rotating baskets, with flat sheet rectangular membranes fitted on alternate sides of their radial arms. Maximum permeate flux was evaluated to be as high as 2.4 x 10 (4) m(3) m(-2) s(-1) at moderate transmembrane pressure and rotational speed (588 kPa and 52.36 rad s(-1)). High rate of flux regeneration (>85% of start-up flux), even after 11 h of filtration run and moderately high flux (2.6 x 10 (6) m(3) m(-2) s(-1)) for concentrated feed solution (10.5 kg m(-3)) clearly establish the novelty of present design. Irrespective of low packing density, outcomes of this investigation suggests viable commercial use of ISBM module in treatment of extremely fouling feed solutions, for which other standard membrane units are apprehended to be inoperative.

AB Two-phase natural circulation and boiling experiments are conducted in this study with artificial seawater as a heat transfer fluid or process coolant. This experimental work is focused on understanding the role of dissolved salts in water on the steady state two-phase natural circulation flow rates. Mass flow rates were measured at different heat flux levels with artificial seawater, deionized water and tap water in the experimental loop. It was found that the average quasi-steady state mass flow rates were the same at any particular heat flux level regardless of the fluid being used. Artificial seawater coolant exhibited more stable natural circulation at higher heat flux as compared to the other two coolants. Mass flow measurements recorded at 2 s intervals show that magnitude of flow oscillations are much higher in case of tap water and deionized water. Also, high speed camera images revealed that the bubble departure diameters are smaller in seawater compared to tap or deionized water. This can be attributed to the increased local wettability due to the presence of dissolved salts in the fluid. Visual observations of the riser section showed that bubble coalescence and formation of slugs is inhibited in the seawater. These observations also explain the reduced pressure drop across test section when seawater was used as a coolant. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SPRAY FORMATION; BINARY-MIXTURE; WATER
AB When a liquid at a high pressure is driven out through an orifice to below its saturation pressure, flash-boiling of the homogeneous nucleation type may occur, resulting in high quality liquid atomization. This is one of the most effective means of generating a fine and narrow-dispersed spray. The occurrence of flash boiling atomization involves kinetic stability problems that are characterized by two criteria that include a minimal initial liquid temperature and a minimal rate of pressure drop. In this work, we analyze, and suggest analytical expressions for these two criteria. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed a unique particle-separation technique based on size that uses kHz-band ultrasound irradiation in water. Dispersed-millimeter-size particles in dissolved-gases water form themselves into a spherically flocculated particle swarm (SFPS). With the changes of ultrasound irradiation properties, the particles are separated according to their sizes. We previously investigated the characteristics of an SFPS and elucidated its formation mechanism. To achieve an efficient and precise particle-separation technique, the forces acting on the particles during the transition state of the ultrasound modulation must be determined, but it is difficult to clarify the forces acting on each particle. Herein, we experimentally and systematically investigated the forces acting on a single particle trapped in the sound pressure field. We discuss nine types of forces acting on the particle and the bubble adhering to its surface. Under the static state, the particle buoyancy was counterbalanced with the acoustic radiation force acting on the acoustic cavitation-oriented bubbles (ACOBs). We examined two types of amplitude change: a gradual amplitude change of the input power of a transducer, and a step-like amplitude change. The results revealed that the particle motion depends on a subtle balance between the acoustic radiation force acting on the ACOBs and unsteady fluid-dynamical forces acting on the particle. We also demonstrate the classification of particles by diameter by controlling the transition state of the amplitude change of the ultra-sound input power. We conclude that the gradual amplitude change provided an efficient and precise classification of particles by their diameters. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pervaporation is a promising membrane technology for separation of aqueous organic solution particularly azeotrope and close-boiling point compounds. However, most of pervaporation membranes are based on hydrophilic polymers that suffer decline of separation performance due to their swelling in aqueous solution. Here we present a copolymer synthetic strategy for preparation of hydrophobic polymer pervaporation membrane with hierarchical porosity via uniting both rigid and flexible segments. The synthesized membrane has well-defined micropores and high free volume faction of 8.03% with cavity size of 0.476 nm, and demonstrate exceptional performance with high permeability and selectivity for dehydration of alcohols. In the pervaporation of ethanol-water azeotrope, the membrane displays the high permeabtion flux of 74.6 mu m kg m(-2) h(-1) and water selectivity of 34 (separation factor of 732) at 30 degrees C. The developed strategy has excellent potential for synthesizing copolymers for high-efficient pervaporation membranes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Low temperature catalytic oxidation (LTCO) is an effective method of treatment for low concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that uses efficient catalysts to reduce reaction activation energy and to improve reaction rates. A series of modified Pt catalysts (Pt-Ce, Pt-Zr) were successfully prepared, and they were used as catalysts for acetone oxidation. Several methods such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Hydrogen-temperatureprogrammed reduction (H-2-TPR) have been used to explore the reaction mechanisms between catalysts and acetone. The results show that Ce-modified Pt catalysts (Pt-Ce/TiO2) display excellent performance for acetone oxidation, and the T-50 (temperature at 50% conversion rate) and T-90 of Pt-Ce/TiO2 are 210 degrees C and 236 degrees C, respectively. The XPS results show that the amount of Pt-0 (metal) in the Pt-Ce/TiO2 was significantly higher than that in the Pt/TiO2. The addition of Ce favors the formation of more Pt-0 (metal) on the catalyst surface, which accelerates the acetone oxidation. It can be concluded that the additional Pt nanoparticles exposed to the catalyst surface accelerated the process of acetone oxidation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study is devoted to the evaluation of vegetable oils (in this case castor oil) as an inexpensive, sustainable, environment-friendly, natural and promising resource to design/synthesis efficient kinetic/anti-agglomerant methane hydrate inhibitors. The castor-based waterborne polyurea/urethanes (CWPUUs) were synthesized on the basis of the waterborne technique. The high-pressure autoclave cell and high-pressure micro-differential scanning calorimeter (HP-mu DSC) using methane gas were applied to evaluate the inhibition performance of CWPUUs as an inhibitor for methane gas hydrate formation. The results of gas uptake tests confirm that the CWPUUs show high efficiency as kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs). The CWPUUs with similar to 3.2 and 6.8 kD molecular weight delayed the onset time of methane hydrate formation by a factor of 26.8 and 13 times and reduced the methane hydrate growth rate by a factor of 3.8 and 2.5 times in comparison with pure water. The results were further confirmed through DSC measurements, in which the usage of CWPUUs with similar to 3.2 and 6.8 kD molecular weight decreased the mean onset temperature of methane hydrate formation on 6.1 and 4.7 degrees C compared to pure water, respectively. Additives of CWPUUs (1 wt % solution) increased the mean onset time of methane hydrate formation from 2.3 h for pure water to 8.7 and 6.4 h. CWPUUs also demonstrated the thermodynamic inhibition by decreasing the melting temperature of methane hydrates comparing to the pure water system. On the other hand, the torque measurements were used to assess anti-agglomerant performance of CWPUUs. During the methane hydrate formation in the presence of CWPUUs, the torque changes remained constant that suggests the hydrate particles stayed separate without aggregation. Moreover, synthesized CWPUUs can be related to biodegradable substances because their BOD5/CODcr value measured in this work is equal to 0.389. Hence, the application of CWPPUs can be a prospective option for delaying the onset time/temperature of hydrate formation, reducing hydrate growth rate and preventing agglomeration of hydrate particles, and this strategy refers to the terms of green chemistry.

AB Thermochemical heat storage is a promising candidate due to its high energy densities and the possibility of long-term storage in the areas of waste heat recovery and renewable energy utilization. In this work, hexagonal boron nitride (HBN)-doped calcium hydroxide has been prepared by ultrasonic and mechanical agitation. Thermodynamics, kinetic and cycling stability of HBN-doped composites as well as the pure calcium hydroxide are investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal constant analyzer and scanning electron microscope. The obtained results show that the thermal conductivity of the materials has been improved with HBN doping, and the dehydration enthalpy of HBN-doped composites has also been slightly enhanced in comparison to that of the pure calcium hydroxide. In addition, the pre-exponential factor and activation energy associated to the suitable kinetic models are derived for dehydration of both pure and an optimal mass content of 15 wt% HBN-doped composite. Moreover, the results of cycling stability texts indicate that HBN-doped composite shows the improved multicycle activity in comparison to the pure compound. After ten dehydration/rehydration cycles, a 67% of the rehydration conversion remains for HBN-doped composite, exhibiting competitive heat storage capacity with energy density of more than 1000 kJ/kg.

AB Impact of mass and heat transfer on exothermic reaction performance in porous catalytic monolith with triangular channels is investigated by CFD modeling. Detailed analysis of spatial distributions of process characteristics for methane oxidation shows that in the initial part of catalyst volume there is the active subsurface layer. The domain of sharp gradients of the reaction rate is revealed that includes the parts of external surface and thin subsurface layers near the monolith inlet, which results in sharp rearrangement of 3D-field of temperature and reagent concentrations. It is shown that the formation of such conditions is strongly influenced by complex gaseous flow reconstruction with gas penetration into the catalyst volume, significant heat release, and heat transfer between channel wall and gas flow. Though the region with high reaction rate is rather short this could be of high importance for reactor design and selection of optimal operation conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Eulerian-Eulerian models incorporated with the kinetic theory of granular flow were widely used in the simulation of gas-solid two-phase flow, while the effects of mesoscale structures such as particle clusters and gas bubbles could not be considered adequately if traditional homogeneous drag models were adopted in the coarse grid simulations. The energy minimization multiscale (EMMS) model has been proved to facilitate calculating a structure-dependent drag coefficient by considering particle clustering phenomena, which can be coupled with the two-fluid model (TFM) to improve the accuracy of coarse-grid simulation of gas-solid circulating fluidized beds. However, the original EMMS drag model cannot be further applied to the simulation of gas-solid fluidized beds with solids flow rate smaller than zero, e.g., turbulent fluidized beds and cocurrent downward flow, because the original cluster diameter correlation gives rise to a value smaller than single particle diameter or even negative value at extremely low solids fluxes or downward gas-solid flow. In this study, a new proposed cluster evolution equation is proposed by quantifying local clustering dynamics to replace the original cluster diameter correlation. The newly formulated EMMS drag model can be used to avoid a negative cluster diameter to be involved in calculating interphase drag force in the overall fluidization regime. The improved EMMS drag law is incorporated into the Eulerian-Eulerian model to simulate gas-solid turbulent fluidized beds and cocurrent downer reactors, since they both were widely used in many industrial processes. By analyzing local hydrodynamics as well as the axial and radial heterogeneous distributions in the two kinds of fluidized beds, it is clarified that the simulation using the improved EMMS drag model shows a better agreement with the experimental data than the computation using the homogeneous drag law.

AB In this study, the hydrodynamic behavior of coflowing fluids CO2 and ethanol has been investigated in a high-pressure microfluidic reactor working at supercritical conditions, in which the two fluids are completely miscible. The velocity field has been measured by Micro Particle Image Velocimetry (mu PIV) for different temperatures between 20 and 50 degrees C at a fixed pressure of 100 bar. Meanwhile, we have developed a model to investigate numerically the mixing. By comparing the experimental results to a three-dimensional numerical simulation, the mixing model has been validated for the laminar coflow in the micromixer. In order to understand the mixing condition effects, several parameters have been investigated, namely: the Reynolds number, the temperature and the CO2/ethanol ratio. A mixing time constant is defined by using the segregation intensity curve and later used to characterize the mixing quality. The characteristic mixing time has been related to the laminar energy dissipation rate epsilon, similarly to the stretching efficiency model in previous studies. The mixing quality is eventually analyzed in term of segregation index and mixing time. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a new structure kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) that can successfully model symbolic interval-valued data for fault detection. In the proposed structure, interval KPCA (IKPCA) method is proposed to deal with interval-valued data. Two IKPCA models are proposed. The first model is based on the centers and ranges of intervals IKPCA(CR) and the second model is based the upper and lower bounds of intervals IKPCA(UL). Residuals are generated and fault detection indices are computed. The aim of using IKPCA is to ensure robustness to false alarm without affecting the fault detection performance. The proposed fault detection approach is carried out using simulation example and Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

AB A CFD-DEM coupling model with dual-grid multiscale approach is used to model high-speed injection into a packed bed reactor. The present CFD-DEM coupling uses a separate coarse grid for the discrete phase (DEM model) and a fine grid for the continuum phase (CFD model). This CFD-DEM approach allows high grid resolution for solving the gas phase and preserving the accuracy of the CFD solution at higher Reynolds numbers. The dual-grid multiscale approach is used to model high-speed lateral gas injection in a two-dimensional blast furnace reactor. Blast velocities up to u = 230 m s(-1), as in real blast furnace operation, are used to investigate the formation and dynamics of the raceway inside the reactor. The effect of the blast velocity on the size and shape of the raceway was investigated using different jet velocities. It is shown how the use of an adequate grid resolution for the continuum phase is needed in order to achieve a grid independent solution and how it influenced on the discrete solution. It was observed that the variation of the blast velocity directly influenced on the size and shape of the cavity. However, the particles and the flow showed the same pattern and behavior at the different investigated blast velocities, with a proportional scaling according to the gas velocity. At the investigated blast velocities the raceway formed very rapidly showing a transition period with lateral periodic oscillations before stabilization was observed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to the temperature and pressure dependency of gas transport through polymeric and mixed matrix membranes, probing of their separation performance at different operational conditions seems crucial to determine an optimal operational condition. To minimize the number of costly and time consuming experiments, a modified form of van't Hoff-Arrhenius model was developed to consider the simultaneous effects of temperature and pressure on the separation performance of polymeric and mixed matrix membranes. Moreover, the proposed model is capable to consider pressure dependency of energetic parameters of Arrhenius model including activation energies of permeability and diffusivity, heat of sorption and the corresponding pre-exponential factors. The validity of the proposed model was investigated by using permeation coefficients of CO2 and N-2 in a binary mixture through 6FDA-DAM at different temperatures in the range of 35-55 degrees C and in the feed pressure range from 2 to 5 atm. Besides, from data taken from the literature, the proposed model was validated by the prediction of temperature and pressure dependency of transport properties of glassy and rubbery polymers as well as mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for different gas molecules including He, H-2, CO2, O-2, N-2, CH4 and C4H10. Predictions corresponding to 300 data points revealed that the maximum average absolute relative error was 5.1%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, lyophilized nickel catalysts were synthesized and compared with a commercial catalyst (CCom) in the process of dry reforming of methane. Ni-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by epoxide-initiated gelation method and lyophilized with different percentage of active phase: 5 wt% (LNi5), 10 wt% (LNi10), 15 wt% (LNi15) and 20 wt% (LNi20). The catalysts were characterized by physical nitrogen adsorption, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalytic tests were performed at 600 degrees C, 700 degrees C and 800 degrees C. All catalysts were active in the reforming reactions except the LNi5 and CCom catalysts at temperatures of 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C. The LNi10 catalyst at 800 degrees C has presented the highest syngas production. The CCom showed the highest carbon deposition at 600 degrees C with 2.26 mg which represents 4.52% of the initial weight of the catalyst. Increasing the nickel content from 5 wt% to 10 wt% resulted in a syngas gain of 1.31 mu mol/min, 0.86 mu mol/min and 1.25 mu mol/min at 600 degrees C, 700 degrees C and 800 degrees C, respectively. The increase of the active phase from 10 wt% to 15 wt% and 20 wt% did not present significant effects in the syngas production. The lyophilization process in the drying stage of the catalyst has proved to be quite satisfactory in the dry reforming of methane. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of Taylor bubbles rising through circular tubes filled with stagnant power law fluids using CFD and a semi-analytical technique. While the freeware OpenFOAM was used for CFD simulation, the semi-analytical model was developed considering viscous film drainage around the axisymmetric bubble and was closed using a single tuning coefficient from experimental data. Bubble rise velocity derived from both the techniques exhibit good agreement with experiments. Though the velocity field around a bubble rising through a power law fluid does not show any remarkable difference with that observed for bubbles through Newtonian liquids, the rise velocity is noted to depend strongly on both K and n of the power law relationship. Nevertheless, the influence of n is much greater as is evident from the change of nose shape with its variation. Effect of such variation in nose shape is also reflected in the predicted rise velocity. However, as observed in case of Newtonian fluids, for a given n and K, the rise velocity of Taylor bubble asymptotically reaches a constant value as the bubble volume is increased. It is also seen that surface tension does not have any significant effect on the nose shape and rise velocity while it modifies the tail shape. Finally, it has been noted that the increase in rise velocity with tube diameter depicts a non linear trend for non-Newtonian fluids while it is linear for their Newtonian counterpart.

AB The combined performance of a synthetic CaO-Ca12Al14O33 sorbent and an Ni-MgAl2O4 reforming catalyst was tested in a fluidized bed reactor under relevant operating conditions for the sorption-enhanced reforming (SER) process. The effect of CH4 space velocity (i.e. kg(CH4)/h.kg(cat)), steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio and superficial gas velocity on product gas composition was assessed, as well as the effect of regeneration conditions on material performance. Moreover, a bi-functional material prepared by mechanical mixing of the separate materials was also tested in the reactor under consecutive SER/regeneration cycles. H-2 contents as high as 96 vol% (N-2 free, dry basis) were achieved under SER operation, using the separate materials working with an Ni content of 3.75 wt% in the solid bed at 650 degrees C with S/C ratios of 3 and 4. This solid system is able to process up to 0.63 kg(CH4)/h.kg(cat) at 0.1 m/s superficial gas velocity and with an S/C ratio of 4, although the CH4 input has to be reduced to 0.33 kg(CH4)/h.kg(cat) when working with a lower S/C ratio. Similar H-2 contents to those found with the separate materials were obtained with the combined sorbent-catalyst material working with 0.33 kg(CH4)/h.kg(cat) at 0.1 m/s superficial gas velocity and S/C ratios of 3 and 4. The CO2 sorption capacity of the combined material produced the same as that of the separate sorbent particles (i.e. around 0.25 g(CO2)/g calcined sorbent), while remaining stable throughout the SER/regeneration cycles.

AB The optimisation of solid-liquid separation or dewatering processes for more efficient operation and reuse of material streams is of high importance. Suspension dewatering aims to increase the solids concentration and exhibits two limitations: the dewatering extent and the rate.
   A novel dewatering device, called High Pressure Dewatering Rolls (HPDR), has been developed. It combines shear and compression while maintaining a short filtration length between the rollers. The HPDR challenges the limitations of dewatering processes through the application of high pressures and induced shear to aid the extent of dewatering, and a short filtration length to allow fast dewatering. A prototype HPDR is described along with a performance assessment for different operating conditions as well as a comparison against state-of-the-art technology for a variety of industrial suspensions. The results demonstrate that the HPDR prototype, without any optimisation, outperforms or achieves comparable cake solids concentrations to existing equipment in a continuous mode of operation. Analysis of energy consumption and throughput remain outstanding and require further prototype development. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Spout deflection is a common instability phenomenon in spout fluidized beds. However, spout deflection was not well characterized and quantified in the past. In this work, spout deflection in a flat-bottomed spout fluidized bed is investigated at the particle scale by means of Computer Fluid Dynamic-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) coupling approach. Two types of spout deflections - alternating and non-alternating spout deflections are captured by the CFD-DEM simulations and qualitatively analyzed in terms of voidage distributions and particle momentum profiles. The spout deflection angle is defined and used to characterize the intensity of spout deflection quantitatively. Then, the effects of spouting velocity on alternating spout deflection are investigated quantitatively using the spout deflection angle. The simulation results indicate that spouting velocity has a limited effect on the amplitude and frequency of alternating spout deflection. The relation between solid flow pattern and spout behaviour are also investigated with the help of spout deflection angle. The results indicate that spout deflection angle is highly relevant to particle distribution non-uniformity at the upper region of the bed. The study offers a cost-effective tool to characterize and quantify spout deflection in a spout fluidized bed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to investigate the effect of ammonia nitrogen and low-molecular-weight organics on the adsorption of sodium lignosulfonate (SL) on Shenhua coal. Results of adsorption and adsorption film thickness experiments showed that ammonia nitrogen and low-molecular-weight organics have different effects on the adsorption of SL on coal surface, thus resulting in different adsorption configurations of SL. A ternary system that was composed of water-SL-Shenhua coal was established through MD simulation. The adsorption mechanism of SL on Shenhua coal in different solutions was explored, and the influencing factors were analyzed using a microscopic mechanism. Results showed that the adsorption conformations of SL molecules on coal surface in aqueous and low-molecular-weight organics solutions are single-layer and multi-point adsorption, whereas the adsorption conformations in ammonia nitrogen solutions are double-layer adsorption. The mechanism of the adsorption of SL molecule on Shenhua coal surface by ammonia nitrogen and low-molecular-weight organics was studied in detail. The calculation results of adsorption energy are consistent with the experimental results in thermodynamics. This result demonstrates the feasibility and accuracy of the MD simulation.

AB A Thunnus orientalis bone-based collagen hydrolysate (TBCH) was prepared with alcalase, and its osteogenic effect was examined using MC3T3-E1 cells. The mechanism by which TBCH promotes osteogenesis was also investigated. The results showed that TBCH, even at an extremely low concentration (2 mu g/mL), significantly stimulated the proliferation and promoted osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. This suggests that TBCH is biocompatible and potentially useful for promoting bone formation. Moreover, TBCH significantly upregulated the mRNA levels of osteogenic markers, such as runt-related transcription factor 2, alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, and osteocalcin. Western blot results showed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells was activated by treatment with TBCH. Based on these results, we speculate that TBCH could provide a promising way for inducing bone regeneration. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work describes adaptive quadrature, a new feature designed to improve the Discrete Ordinate Method (DOM) in parallel and cone-shaped radiation sources. OpenFOAM was chosen as the simulation framework to implement the new feature. It already included a Discrete Ordinate Method (fvDOM), but it focuses on thermal radiation and is limited to isotropic emission, diffuse phenomena, and non-scattering media. The model was completed to cover volumetric and superficial absorption, isotropic and anisotropic scattering (with user-defined phase functions), diffuse and specular reflection, diffuse and parallel transmission, and three types of superficial emission sources, i.e., isotropic, cone-shaped, and parallel. Additionally, the model is prepared to work in grey mode or with wavelength bands. Multiple regions with different optical properties are also allowed. Most of the model has been validated by individual simulations of every feature in simple geometries that permit an analytical solution, with errors between 0% and 6.08%. These simulations were also verified in a comparison with an established version of the standard DOM, with differences between model implementations below 2.5%. Some advantages of the developed adaptive quadrature are also analysed using simulation results for different radiative sources and angular discretization. The main conclusion is that adaptive quadrature better defines view angle and light direction of emission sources compared to the established DOM, improving significantly the accuracy of the simulation of non-isotropic sources.

AB A "swapped equilibrium" (SE) occurs when the initial concentrations of two chemical species are taken as their equilibrium concentrations, but swapped. In complex mechanisms, this implies that the initial concentrations of the other chemical species remain equal to their corresponding equilibrium concentrations; a phenomenon called Conservatively Perturbed Equilibrium (CPE), described in a previous paper (Chem. Eng. Sci. 196, 2019, 384-390). The SE-phenomenon is illustrated for both a single-step and a two-step mechanism with first-order reactions. For the two-step mechanism, invariant expressions are obtained based on the corrected ratios of CPE concentration profiles, while the other two chemical species are under swapped equilibrium conditions. For the related CPE case, invariant expressions are also obtained considering the same two-step mechanism. The CPE-properties described previously (Chem. Eng. Sci. 196, 2019, 384-390) are now completed with the invariant expressions presented now, specific for the two-step linear mechanism. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ionic dissociation of NaCl has long been thought to be fully understood in terms of the simultaneous removal and hydration of the constituent ions from the surface. However, there are two observations that trouble the current model of ionic dissociation. The first of these observations is that the surface is charged. This has been established by several of studies using laser doppler electrophoresis and membrane electrochemistry. This has not been accounted for in descriptions of ionic dissociation, dissolution or crystallization of salt. The second observation is that the current model, which envisages sodium and chloride ions hydrating and departing the surface, does not yield a rate law consistent with experimental data. These two observations are resolved in this work. It is proposed that the removal of ions form ionic vacancies while deposition forms excess ions on the surface. Vacancies and excess ions are the source of surface charge. The effect of this surface charge affects the rate of removal of ions from the surface, resulting in a feedback mechanism: ionic vacancies are formed by the removal of ions, which affects the rate at which ions are removed. From this model, expressions are derived for the establishment of the charge on the surface and for the kinetics of ionic dissociation, dissolution and crystallization of NaCl. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, we demonstrate a simple method to prepare carbon nanofiber (CNF) with multilevel gradient porous structure derived from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) /PVP core-shell nanofiber. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have confirmed that the as-prepared CNF contains a hollow channel embraced by mesoporous and microporous structures. Its specific surface area reaches to 1084 m(2)/g with the mesoporous volume contribution of 59%. The as-prepared porous CNF shows a high capacitance of 331 F/g at 1 A/g and 99.6% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 5 A/g, which is better than the corresponding CNF with irregularly arranged hierarchical pores. The all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor assembled using the as-prepared porous CNF as electrodes exhibits an excellent high specific capacitance of 147.4F/g at 1 A/g with a high energy density of 13.1Wh/kg. The capacitance retention still maintains at 89.2% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 5 A/g. Meanwhile, the as-prepared porous CNF also shows a high CO2 adsorption uptake, 5.08 mmol/g at 0 degrees C and 1 bar. The possible reason and mechanism have been discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Quercetin nanoparticles encapsulated by Polysorbate 80 were produced by supercritical fluid extraction of emulsion. To analyze the effect of supercritical fluid parameters on organic solvent extraction by scCO(2), Peng-Robinson equation of state was employed to obtain the pressure-composition diagram of the mixture system concerned. Also, Huang equation was adopted in combination with Peng-Robinson equation to calculate the density of the solvent/CO2 binary system. The effects of supercritical fluid parameters such as pressure and temperature on emulsion stability in the emulsion extraction stage and extraction efficiency in both emulsion and solution extraction stages were examined experimentally. The analytical and experimental results showed that phase separation could happen in the emulsion extraction stage because of the swelling and the rapid decrease in the density of ethyl acetate droplets in the emulsion to the minimum density point as the mole fraction of CO2 in ethyl acetate increased with the rise in pressure below the mixture critical point. To avoid the minimum density point, a lower pressure (<6 MPa) could be employed to guarantee the emulsion stability while the similar level of extraction efficiency in the emulsion extraction stage was retained. The supercritical fluid extraction was proven to be very efficient in reducing the content of residual organic solvent in the solution extraction stage with the minimum residual content as low as 5.3 ppm.

AB Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are the main expression system for production of therapeutic recombinant (r-) proteins. The increased demand for these therapeutics has boosted the development of more robust production processes. Use of optimised feed/media has dramatically improved the performance of CHO cells in culture. However, such progress in biomass synthesis and r-protein production often come with an increased accumulation of lactate. In this study, we present a combined feeding strategy that uses galactose and lactate to replace glucose in CHO cell cultures. Replacement of glucose by galactose and lactate sustained cell growth and r-protein production in CHO cells. This strategy supported a better-balanced and more efficient metabolism, observed by an overall decreased consumption of carbon sources and amino acids, associated with an increased ATP production per C-mol consumed. Our results provide new insights of CHO cell metabolism in glucose-free media based on galactose and lactate. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evaporative deposition of mono-and bi-dispersed colloids on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface was studied. At particle concentrations of 0.02 and 0.08 wt%, 1.58 mu m diameter polystyrene (PS) microparticles were uniformly distributed from mono-dispersed colloids. PS microparticles located at the edge of the deposition increased when the particle concentration increased to 0.32 and 1.28 wt%. Mono-dispersed colloids of 1.21 mu m silica microparticles produced a ring-like deposition at particle concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.32 wt%. The width of the ring increased with increasing concentration and a mountain-like structure was produced at 1.28 wt%. The settling speed of 1.21 mu m silica microparticles is 14 times greater than 1.58 mu m PS microparticles resulting in easier settling of silica compared with PS microparticles. Experimental investigations show PS microparticles are dragged inward with the depinning contact line, and the outmost silica microparticles are pinned. The edge of the depositions of bi-dispersed colloids were made up of smaller microparticles and larger microparticles were found far from the edge due to capillary force. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Separating chalcopyrite, an important copper-containing ore, from pyrite is an important mineral-processing objective. Herein, we report the synthesis of S-hydroxyethyl-O-isobutyl xanthate (HEIBX), a novel surfactant bearing both hydroxyl and thione groups, through the attachment of a hydroxyethyl group to sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX), and its first application as a flotation collector for the selective flotation-separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite. The flotation mechanism involving HEIBX and chalcopyrite or pyrite was investigated by DFT calculations, UV-vis spectroscopy, contact-angle and surface-tension measurements, flotation and zeta-potential experiments, as well as FTIR spectroscopy and XPS. Incorporation of the hydroxyethyl group was observed to increase the molecular properties of SIBX by increasing the number of active sites, arrangement density, selectivity and hydrophobicity, thereby improving its flotation performance. Chalcopyrite was separated from pyrite using 4 x 10(-5) mol.L-1 HEIBX at pH similar to 8.0. Furthermore, we found that the hydroxyl and thione functional groups adsorb onto the chalcopyrite surface though the formation of C-O-Cu and C-S-Cu bonds. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pt-Pd-HMS catalyst had been prepared by a one-pot approach and tested for toluene combustion. Comparing with conventional impregnated Pt-Pd/HMS (E-a = 111.41 kJ/mol, Pt-Pd particle size = 23.4 nm), the Pt-Pd-HMS exhibited lower activation energy (E-a = 80.23 kJ/mol) and smaller Pt-Pd particle size (6.3 nm). Moreover, surface Pt-0/Pt-total of the Pt-Pd-HMS (52.8%) was higher than that of the Pt-Pd/HMS (46.8%), and Pt-Pd-HMS obtained an optimal catalytic performance with T-90 = 179 degrees C at a GHSV = 26,000 mL/(g.h). In-situ DRIFTS indicated that simultaneous generation of benzoate species and aliphatic compounds as intermediates occurred on the active sites of Pt-Pd-HMS. In contrast, the intermediates of toluene combustion on the active sites of Pt-Pd/HMS were dominated by benzoates. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon deposition on the iron surface is of great interest due to a good performance to prevent sticking during the direct reduction (DR) in the fluidized bed. The promising routes of carbon formation were investigated by the density function theory (DFT). An innovative kinetic model, which considers adsorption and decomposition of CO, is applied to control the carbon content of direct reduction iron in the two-stages reduction process. The results show that the C-O bond of CO is stretched due to the attractive force of surface iron atoms on the C and O atoms. The added H-2 can significantly improve this C-O bond stretch to decrease the barrier energy of CO decomposition. The formation of carbon is sensitive to the temperature and the added H-2 can extend the temperature range for carbon formation and reduce the temperature of the maximum rate of carbon formation. Besides, the proper concentration of H-2 added in the CO/H-2 mixtures can improve the formation of carbon shell. However, the carbon shell will not be formed under a condition of extremely high mole fraction of H-2 because H-2 increases the adsorption energy of CO on the iron surface. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Natural food colorants are on demand due to food safety concerns related with some synthetic counterparts. Health-friendly alternatives can be available from plant sources, which include curcumin extracted from Curcuma longa L. However, its industrial use is difficult to achieve due to the low water affinity, pH and thermal instability, which is particularly challenging, e.g. for baked foods. In this work, the solid dispersion technique followed by spray-drying, an emergent approach in the context of colorants, was applied to curcumin using k-carrageenan, poly(vinyl alcohol) and polyvinylpyrrolidone, as the encapsulant materials. An orthogonal central composite design with dummy-variables was applied, and principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) carried out to identify the experimental conditions leading to the most effective formulations. In general, particles with a wide range of pH and heat stability have been produced depending on the chosen encapsulant material, used formulation (curcumin, surfactant and polymer contents), and synthesis conditions (pH). Moreover, the used mathematical approach showed to be a valuable tool to support the development of tailor-made formulations directed to specific applications where pH and temperature are relevant processing parameters.

AB Solids volumetric flux (V-s), which is expected to replace the solids mass flux (G(s)) as the key factor influencing solids holdup in circulating fluidized beds, was proposed to investigate the solids holdup variation and predict the extreme operation conditions in the downers. In this work, by using more than 400 sets of experimental data from different literature in Response Surface Methodology (RSM) analysis, it is found that the overestimation of particle density effect on the solids holdup can be avoided by converting the G(s) into V-s. Further studies indicated that the difference of solids holdup (Delta epsilon(s)) resulted from the different types of particles increased with the increase in V-s as well as the decrease in superficial gas velocity (U-g). Based on the normalized fitting results, the effects of different factors on the solids holdup were characterized. It is concluded that the effect extent was in the order of V-s > U-g >> particle size (d(p)) > particle density (rho(p)), which provided a guidance to control the solids holdup to satisfy the requirements in the downer by adjustment of various parameters, that is, V-s and U-g can adjust solids holdup roughly whereas d(p) and rho(p) can adjust solids holdup finely. Meanwhile, it is found that the upper limit of solids volumetric flux (V-s,V-max) can be increased by the increase of U-g, d(p) and/or rho(p). In addition, it is considered that using V-s to replace G(s) to define high-density operation in the downer could be more suitable in this study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nickel hydroxide nanobristles were fabricated on the surface of hollow carbon nanofibers (HPCNFs) through a low cost and effective bio-mediated technology, where the eggshells with eggshell membrane were selected as multifunctional reactors to separate the precursor solution to control OH ion diffusion in order to form alpha-Ni(OH)(2) instead of beta-Ni(OH)(2). The as prepared Ni(OH)(2)/HPCNFs displays high capacity (283 mAh/g) and a remarkable cycle life (82% specific capacity retained after 5000 cycle numbers) in 1M KOH aqueous solution. Compared with literature reports, in which Ni(OH)(2) are often considered for pseudocapacitors, we suggest our electrodes are good for rechargeable alkaline secondary batteries or as battery electrodes in hybrid supercapacitors, based on battery behavior observed in our electrochemical measurements. As battery electrodes in hybrid supercapacitors, an asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated, in which Ni(OH)(2)/HPCNFs and activated carbon as positive and negative electrode, respectively (Ni(OH)(2)/HPCNFs//AC ASC), which displays intriguing electrochemical performances with a high energy density (31.3 Wh/kg at 300.5 W/kg). The results demonstrate that the bio-mediated method for achieving Ni(OH)(2)/HPCNFs nanomaterials is becoming a promising technology in alkaline batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recovery of valuable elements from (industrial process) photovoltaic wastes would be beneficial for both economical and sustainability reasons. In this work, nano zero-valent iron/activated carbon nanotubes (NZVI/ACNTs) hybrid membranes were fabricated by using NZVI as dynamic layer and CNTs as substrate for deep tellurium extraction, where the NZVI particles were formed by in situ reduction. Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption properties of NZVI/ACNTs hybrid membranes under different solution conditions such as pH, temperature, sorbent dosage, and competitive ions. Energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed good adsorption capacity of tellurium by NZVI/ACNTs through redox reactions. The tellurium adsorption capacities decreased in the presence of competitive ions and as the concentration of NO3 significantly increased, the adsorption quantity dropped from 331.6 to 286.5 mg/g. Extraction of tellurium under weakly acidic conditions had a positive effect and reached a maximum adsorption capacity about 800 mg/g at pH 4.7. Kinetic models and equilibrium isotherms fitted well to the adsorption experimental data indicating that chemical adsorption dominate during the adsorption process of NZVI/ACNTs-Te. As a reusable and high-efficient adsorbent, NZVI/ACNTs membrane has tremendous potential to handle and recycle toxic tellurium containing compounds. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfonic-acid-functionalized Bronsted acidic ionic liquids (SFILs) have been considered as a promising dual solvent-catalyst for numerous applications. The bulk microstructure and interfacial characteristics of different kinds of SFILs and the corresponding SFIL/H2SO4 systems were investigated in this work using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in terms of the SFILs possessing three anions (e.g. bisulfate, triflate, and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide), different alkyl chain lengths, and different introduced position of the sulfonic acid groups (-SO3H). The introduction of the sulfonic acid groups is found to provide a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction site with both the HSO4 and H2SO4, making almost two order of magnitudes larger for average numbers of hydrogen bonds between different pairs. The introduction of sulfonic acid groups onto the shorter side chains contributes to stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions with both the HSO4 and H2SO4 than when introduced onto the longer side chains. The coordination numbers of the equivalent terminal carbon atoms of octyl chain and equivalent sulfur atoms of sulfonic acid groups are more than 4.5 and 2.5, respectively, which suggests that obvious nanostructured aggregation of the polar sulfonic acid groups, as well as nonpolar longer alkyl chains, exists in the pure SFILs and SFIL/H2SO4 systems. In addition, it is found that the ordering preference and interfacial orientation of the side chains and imidazole rings at gas-liquid interfaces are sharply changed following the addition of the sulfonic acid groups. The insights into the bulk structural and interfacial characteristics of the SFIL/H2SO4 systems obtained in this work may inform the design and optimization of novel SFILs for specific catalytic applications.

AB Concentration polarization is a serious issue for systems in which high-flux, palladium-based, hydrogen perm-selective membranes are used to extract hydrogen, not only for packed-bed reactor systems, but also for fluidized bed membrane reactors. Two-Fluid Model simulations of 3D cylindrical lab-scale fluidized beds with single and multiple vertically immersed cylindrical membranes with state-of-the-art hydrogen permeability were performed to quantify concentration polarization, to study the interaction between concentration polarization zones of multiple vertically immersed membranes and to link these findings to the bed hydrodynamics. Simulations of a fluidized bed consisting of 500 mu m particles using a H-2/N-2 mixture as fluidization gas with a single immersed membrane, show that reduced hydrogen concentrations prevail mostly within 1 cm from the membrane surface, and have disappeared beyond about 2 cm distance from the membrane surface. A 3D simulation was compared to a Cartesian 2D simulation that represents a slice of the 3D system, to assess the accuracy of 2D simulations. The 2D simulation did not fully capture the hydrodynamics and radial mass transfer effects of 3D cylindrical fluidized bed membrane reactors and overestimated the severity of concentration polarization and the formation of densified zones near the membrane surface. In particular, the hydrogen fluxes were determined at 0.217 mol/(m(2) s Pa-0.5) for the 3D case, and 0.133 mol/(m(2) s Pa-0.5) for the 2D case. The severity of densified zones is also affected by the particle size, because for smaller particles (250 mu m) the emulsion phase density near the membrane surface is higher than for systems with larger particles (500 mu m), which results in increased concentration polarization and a reduced extractive hydrogen flux. Therefore, employing relatively large particles of at least 500 mu m in fluidized beds with modern high-flux membranes is advised. In fluidized beds with multiple membranes, interaction between concentration polarization zones of each membrane was observed. The interaction becomes more significant at smaller inter-membrane distances, especially below 2 cm, and decreasing the bed diameter decreases the system performance even more due to hydrogen depletion. Vertically immersed membranes also affect the fluidized bed hydrodynamics by reducing bubble size and increasing the number of small bubbles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plug flow, which affects the reliable feeding of pulverized coal, is one of flow patterns in dense-phase pneumatic conveying of pulverized coal. The control and formation mechanism of plug flow are very important for the industrial application and theoretical research. In this work, experiments were carried out on a pneumatic conveying test platform in the Key Lab of Coal Gasification and Energy Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education, ECUST, to study on the plug flow in the industrial vertical pipe under a low superficial gas velocity. All the flow states and flow patterns of the dense-phase pneumatic conveying process were analyzed. The present study shows that five different particle velocity distributions were found in the plug flow. However, the time series of the pressure and solid concentration signal are almost the same. What's more, the power spectral density function analysis provides the relationship of the solid concentration signal of the cross-section by the electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) between all four operational cases and five different kinds of plug flows. From the point view of application, five different kinds of the plug flow were characterized by the plug length, fluctuation parameter of the plug flow (the Strouhal number) and the operational parameters (Lockhart-Martinelli parameter and the Froude number of the gas phase and the solid phase). Based on the phase diagram constructed using the Strouhal number and Lockhart-Martinelli parameter, five types of plug flow could be predicted. A larger Strouhal number indicates the poorer stability of the plug flow. Moreover, the formation mechanism of the plug flow was analyzed by the Janssen equation. Finally, we found that all types of the plug flow have the same unit friction force based on a statistical discussion. Through this work, we wish that our research will give a deeper understanding of the formation and control of the plug flow in the dense-phase pneumatic conveying of pulverized coal.

AB Copolymers of vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and hexafluoropropylene (HFP) make up the largest volume of fluoroelastomers sales. Within this family, Viton A (VDF/HFP 60/40 wt%, 66% fluorine) is most important commercially. Determination of thermomechanical properties of such fluorinated polymers is still limited to experimentation or empirical models, while computational prediction of their physical properties is still at its infancy. Considerable efforts have been made to develop molecular force fields for the prediction of properties of various crystalline as well as amorphous fluorinated substances. These force fields were parametrized based on small molecules or oligomers, hence their transferability to longer and more complex (i.e. copolymer) chain architectures must be tested. In this work, thermodynamic, structural, and mechanical properties of the Viton A fluoroelastomer are evaluated using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for several force fields and compared with available experimental data. Differences in molecular structure of the chains modeled by different force fields are shown to substantially influence thermodynamic and mechanical behavior. OPLS-derived force fields give rise to extended chains that are more mobile and result in softer material that lack in molecular structure. Other force fields rely on strong nonbonded interactions that interfere with chain dynamics and mechanics. PCFF is shown to most satisfactorily predict structural properties and thermal volumetric behavior around T-g, demonstrating relatively successful transferability to long linear polymer chains.

AB The effects of temperature, pressure, steam ratio and K-based composite catalysts on the pressurized steam gasification of sawdust char were studied and the physicochemical structure of composite catalysts was characterized in detail. The results indicated that steam promoted the production of hydrogen but suppressed that of CH4. The generation of CH4 required high pressure, low temperature and suitable steam atmosphere. The composite catalysts reduced the reaction temperature and increased the carbon conversion, theirs catalytic performance ranked in descending order was KCe > KCo > KFe > KNi, where KCe showed perfect catalytic performance, which mainly determined by the ability to activate carbon during pressurized steam gasification of char. KFe and KCo were more conducive to water-gas-shift reaction, while KNi had the better performance on gasification reaction. The transformation paths of the composite catalysts were as follows: Ce(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O -> CeO2, Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O -> CoO/Co3O4 -> Co -> CoO, Fe (NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O -> Fe2O3 -> FeO -> Fe3O4 and Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O -> NiO -> Ni.

TI Mass transfer estimation for bubble column scale up
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS; OXYGEN-TRANSFER; AERATION
AB The productivity of a bubble column reactor (BCR) critically depends upon gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient, k(L)a. The prediction of k(L)a as function of design and operating conditions is central to BCR scale up. A large number of researchers have successfully characterized k(L)a experimentally in terms of superficial gas velocity, U-sg using the power law relation k(L)alpha = alpha U-sg(beta), with alpha, beta as fit parameters. We probe the applicability of such correlations to the design of a scaled up BCR, which differs from laboratory BCR in two important aspects: (i) the scale of operation, which can be O(10(2) - 10(3)) times larger, and (ii) the type of sparger used. To this end, experiments were performed with air and water in a pilot scale (D-C = 1.6 m diameter) BCR using a coarse bubble sparger. We found that the existing correlations do, indeed, describe k(L)a over a wide range of BCR sizes, suggesting that these correlations are fairly scale insensitive. However, the correlations provide no means to capture the role of sparger explicitly. We cast our experimental k(L)a values in terms of a mass transfer efficiency and independently recover the power law relation with beta = 1. We suggest that the role of sparger design can be incorporated in the definition of alpha through the well-documented sparger efficiency factors. The alpha and beta estimates thus obtained are in good agreement with the literature. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents the model of a solar thermochemical looping CO2/H2O dissociation (CL) unit with commercial ceria as the redox oxygen carrier. The CL unit is integrated in an oxy-fuelled combined cycle power plant as an add-on unit to a 100 MW oxy-fuelled natural gas power plant with carbon capture. The efficiency benefit obtained was investigated. A moving bed counter-current reactor model, developed in ASPEN Plus (R), consisting of a series of rigorous continuous stirred reactors (RCSTRs) was used for the simulation of both reduction and oxidation reactors of the CL unit. A kinetic subroutine was developed in FORTRAN and linked with each RCSTR for both reduction and oxidation reactions. It is found that the efficiency of the CL unit varies widely with reduction reactor temperature and operating pressure. Considering three different compositions of the feed gas to the oxidation reactor, the CL unit efficiency is obtained as: 35.41% with CO2 only; 30.84% with H2O only; and 35.26% for a mixture of 86% CO2 and 14% H2O. The lower efficiency for H2O-only operation is due to the heat requirement for water vaporization and the higher compression work required for compressing H-2 than CO. The maximum solar to electrical efficiency for the whole add-on unit is found to be 25.44% with a reduction reactor operating at a temperature of 1600 degrees C and 10(-7) bar vacuum pressure. With 0.5 m(3) reduction reactor volume and 5 m(3) oxidation reactor volume, the maximum net electricity produced by the CL add-on unit is 12.85 MWe. Economic analysis revealed that the major contributors to total plant cost are the hydrogen compressor and solar field and tower, which are the 19% and 39% of the total equipment cost, giving a specific overnight capital cost of 12,136 $/kW with an LCOE of 1321 $/MWh with a capacity factor of 21%. The LCOE drops to 628 $/MWh with a carbon tax of 80 $/tonne of CO2 and increased capacity factor of 26%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A modified three-layer model for solid-liquid flow in inclined pipes is developed, which overcomes the limitations of previous mechanistic models. The steady-state model predicts the pressure loss, critical velocity, concentration profile in the heterogeneous layer, mean heterogeneous layer and moving bed layer velocities, and bed layer heights for each set of parameters. We propose a new correlation for the turbulent solids diffusivity, and include appropriate closures for forces and stresses attributed to the solids and liquid phases in the different layers. The proposed turbulent solids diffusivity correlation and the steady-state model predictions show a good agreement with experimentally measured results in the literature: for concentration profiles in the heterogeneous layer, pressure losses and critical (deposition) velocity, both over a wide range of parameters and for different regimes. We also define a critical Peclet number based on which, a transition boundary between bed-load and heterogeneous regimes can be found. This boundary implicitly represents the critical velocity. In turbulent flow, the pressure loss vs mean velocity curve shows a characteristic minimum just before the critical velocity is attained, in agreement with published research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sandpiles are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications but still not fully understood due to the complexity of structures and materials properties. This work presents a systematic study on the piles of Platonic solids using the discrete element method (DEM), mainly focusing on the effect of particle shape on the repose angles and bottom pressure distributions of the piles. Five Platonic particles (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron) were discharged to form wedge-shaped piles. It was found that the repose angle did not increase with the decrease of particle sphericity. The pile formed by the cubes had the maximum repose angle and its bottom stress dip phenomena were more significant in terms of dip width and depth than that of other particle piles. The pressure distributions at different heights of the piles were quite similar to those of the whole piles, while the shear stress distributions near the boundaries exhibited different characteristics for the cube piles. The analyses of packing structures in terms of coordination number, radial distribution function, as well as contact types inside the piles were discussed to understand the change of pressure dips. The influence of static friction on the repose angle was more significant and it enhanced the stress dip phenomenon. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bypass-Simulated moving bed (BP-SMB) chromatography, a process characterized by the possibility of over-purifying the raffinate and/or the extract product followed by blending with the feed, is studied. The BP-SMB provides additional degrees of freedom; the opportunity to increase productivity; increased robustness and operational flexibility compared to obtaining reduced purities directly from the SMB. Based on the local-equilibrium theory, explicit equations to calculate productivity are derived for systems following a linear isotherm based on the minimum switch time. It is shown that the BP-SMB offers productivity advantage compared to a reduced-purity SMB specifically at low purity requirements, high selectivity and high efficiency conditions. The effect of column efficiency and feed concentration for systems following non-linear isotherms are studied using numerical simulations. The production of high-fructose corn syrup, an industrial application of BP-SMB, is analysed. For the HFCS separation, it is shown that a BP-SMB operation while not providing any advantages in terms of productivity, provides operational flexibility and robustness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A three-stage fluidized bed strategy was proposed to enhance the conversion of methanol into aromatics (MTA) with Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst, where the 1st stage (near the bottom) served the aromatization of methanol, the 2nd stage (in the middle) served the aromatization of C-3-C-5 paraffins and the 3rd stage (near the exit) served mainly the aromatization of C-2-C-4 olefins in sequence. The yield of aromatics in the 2nd stage increased by 7.0-9.0% compared with the 1st stage. And the final yield of aromatics at the exit of 3rd stage was kept at 62-66% for a long time, 8.0-15.0% higher than that of the exit of 1st stage. The effect of coke deposition in different stages on the evolution of aromatics, olefins and alkanes was investigated to clarify the consecutive reaction chain during MTA. As fully meeting the requirements of the different conversion characteristics of methanol and their intermediates, very high-yield production of aromatics by the single-pass conversion of methanol was achieved with this strategy.

AB In blast furnaces, burden topography and packing density affect the stability of the burden, permeability of gas flow as well as the heat transfer efficiency. A fundamental understanding of the influence and interaction of coke and ore particles on the burden topography and packing density is therefore essential, in particular, the influence of particle shape polydispersity and particle size polydispersity. In this paper we analyze the effect of particle shape and size polydispersity on the coke and ore charge distribution inside a bell-less blast furnace using the discrete element method (DEM). We first validate experimentally the polyhedral particle model with a simplified lab-scale charging experiment. A comparative study between spheres, with rolling friction to account for shape, and polyhedra is conducted for shape and size polydisperse particle systems. It was found that shape polydispersity mainly influenced the topography of the burden, whereas the size polydispersity mainly influenced the inter-layer percolation, i.e. localized particle diffusion, hence the local spatial packing density. The differences between the spherical particle models and polyhedral particle models on the burden topography are also quantitatively and qualitatively presented, especially on the role of particle shape on the push-up of coke in the centre. This study demonstrates that modelling particle shape effects using spheres with rolling friction is insufficient to fully describe the complex behaviour of shaped particles in a blast furnace, as the particle shape has a noteworthy influence on the burden characteristics.

AB The dynamics of a droplet suspended in a medium fluid is determined by the hydrodynamic forces and surface tension force, and the Taylor analogy had been successfully employed to predict droplet deformation and breakup in a spray. This paper aims to extend the Taylor analogy for prediction of droplet dynamics in planar extensional flow which has great significance in droplet-based microfluidic systems. Performance of the proposed model is compared with the three-dimensional numerical simulation results over a wide range of capillary number and viscosity ratio. Experimental data available in the literature is also compared with the prediction results for verification purpose. The proposed model could describe both the time scale and the magnitude of droplet deformation accurately. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bubble segmentation and size detection algorithms have been developed in recent years for their high efficiency and accuracy in measuring bubbly two-phase flows. In this work, we proposed an architecture called bubble generative adversarial networks (BubGAN) for the generation of realistic synthetic images which could be further used as training or benchmarking data for the development of advanced image processing algorithms. The BubGAN is trained initially on a labeled bubble dataset consisting of ten thousand images. By learning the distribution of these bubbles, the BubGAN can generate more realistic bubbles compared to the conventional models used in the literature. The trained BubGAN is conditioned on bubble feature parameters and has full control of bubble properties in terms of aspect ratio, rotation angle, circularity and edge ratio. A million bubble dataset is pre-generated using the trained BubGAN. One can then assemble realistic bubbly flow images using this dataset and associated image processing tool. These images contain detailed bubble information, therefore do not require additional manual labeling. This is more useful compared with the conventional GAN which generates images without labeling information. The tool could be used to provide benchmarking and training data for existing image processing algorithms and to guide the future development of bubble detecting algorithms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for adsorption cooling has won increasing research interests due to their outstanding adsorption performance. Zr-MOFs with relatively stable water stability and distinct structure properties are potential adsorbents for cooling. In this work, three Zr-MOFs: UiO-66 UiO-67 and NU-1000 with varying pore sizes were synthesized, and their water and ethanol adsorption isotherms were measured. The specific cooling effects (SCE) and coefficient of performance (COP) of MOF/water and MOF/ethanol working pairs in adsorption cooling system (ACS) were evaluated by adsorption system modeling. The results revealed that the MOFs with small pores and low steps (P/P-0) (i.e. UiO-66) in isotherms are favorable for water working fluid, which can achieve high SCE and COP at relative low temperatures. In contrast, MOFs with large pores and suitable steps (i.e. NU-1000) is preferential for ethanol working fluid due to the high uptake. Although water working fluid generally exhibited higher SCE and COP than ethanol, MOF/ethanol outperformed MOF/water because the equivalent cooling performance can be achieved at low temperature as well as the high recycle stability of MOFs/ethanol working pairs.

AB The requirement for sustainable development has prompted the researchers to explore solutions for better utilization of renewable energy resources in the future. Biomass is a promising resource and it can be converted to multiple products and services including fuels, chemicals, heat and electricity via different conversion routes. Hence, replacement of fossil-based services with biomass-based services is critical to mitigate fossil CO2 emissions, and innovative design of new and efficient energy conversion systems is necessary. Different industries need heat for their operations at different temperature levels. Today, these demands are satisfied using conventional natural gas boilers by imposing a CO2 tax to account for their emissions. In this study, we discuss the potential of replacing conventional boilers with a combined heat and fuel (CHF) plant design which utilizes lignocellulosic biomass in thermochemical conversion to generate heat for different industrial sectors together with biofuels cogeneration. Heat is generated due to the exothermic nature of the thermochemical conversion processes that operate at high temperatures. Gasification process produces syngas which is converted into fuels such as synthetic natural gas, Fischer-Tropsch crude, methanol and dimethyl ether and electricity. Different scenarios are evaluated considering the CO2 produced via this system is either released, sequestrated, or stored and used in a co-electrolysis unit in which surplus renewable electricity available during summer is converted into additional syngas. A parametric analysis has been performed considering type and size of plants, CO2 tax, and purchase and transportation costs of wood to compare the price of heat for the industrial sectors. Natural gas and wood boilers are used as the basis to calculate the breakeven CO2 tax values for the same heat prices for the proposed CHF systems. The results of this study present a state-of-the-art renewable energy system as an alternative to conventional boilers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports a combined numerical and experimental approach to study the coal carbonization process. It is applied to low rank coal ellipsoidal briquettes carbonization in a pilot-scale coke oven for demonstration. The integrated mathematical model integrates a DEM model to simulate the packing process of ellipsoidal briquettes in the oven and a CFD model to simulate the flow and thermochemical behaviours related to the carbonization process. The model is validated against the experimental measurements in the pilot-scale coke oven. The comprehensive in-furnace phenomena in the carbonization process are simulated, in terms of flow, temperature, gas composition, and carbonization characteristics. The simulation results indicate that it is necessary to include the briquettes packing structure evolution in the carbonization modelling for reliably describing the in-furnace phenomena. Then the effects of some briquette packing parameters, including briquette dropping height and vertical vibration, on the evolutions of packing structure and carbonization behaviour are studied. It is indicated that the dense packing structure resulting from higher dropping height and one-dimensional vertical vibration before the carbonization can improve the heat and mass transfers between the gas and bed, and thus can improve the carbonization efficiency. The computational cost of this approach as well as its future application are discussed. This model provides a cost-effective tool for understanding and optimizing the carbonization process of non-spherical low rank coal briquettes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Glycosidases have been widely used in natural products modification by precisely hydrolyzing sugar moieties to modulate the biological activities. However, the low stability of the glycosidases under harsh conditions and the low solubility of substrate have largely impeded the biotransformation efficiency. To solve this problem, in this study, we selected the biotransformation of glycyrrhizin (GL) into glycyrrhetinic acid 3-O-mono-beta-D-glucuronide (GAMG) catalyzed by beta-glucuronidase from T. pinophilus Li-93 (TpGUS79A-P) as a model reaction. We combined three strategies including random mutagenesis, computation-aided design and rational introduction of "clamp" to TIM-barrel domain to enhance the thermostability of TpGUS79A-P, and one mutant TpGUS79A-P4 was obtained with thermostability at 55 degrees C increased by 2.9-fold. The enzymatic properties of TpGUS79A-P4 were extensively characterized. Finally, a novel high-temperature biotransformation process of GL into GAMG catalyzed by TpGUS79A-P4 was established at 50 degrees C, with GAMG concentration increased by 84% than that at 30 degrees C.

AB In this paper, graphene oxide based nanohybrids decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2@rGO) were synthesized and incorporated into the thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membrane for efficient organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) with antifouling properties. In order to improve the compatibility of TiO2@rGO in the polyamide active layer, the nanohybrids were amino-functionalized before their incorporation in the interfacial polymerization process. TiO2@rGO incorporated TFN membranes showed intense permeability increment and antifouling characteristics in comparison with the controlled composite membrane and graphene oxide (GO) incorporated TFN membrane. The GO nanosheets structure favors solvent channeling and TiO2 provides super hydrophilic characteristics, both resulted in a super permeable-hydrophilic OSN membrane with high structural stability and premium antifouling properties.

AB The hydrogenation of aromatic compounds is mainly controlled by diffusion; hence, the diffusion of reactants into the pores of a catalyst has a significant effect on the catalytic reaction. However, the diffusivity of reactant molecules is poorly characterized due to the limitations of experimental technology. In this study, the diffusion behavior of benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene in alumina pores of three different sizes, namely, 3.1 nm, 5.2 nm, and 6.8 nm pores, at 623.15-723.15 K is investigated using a molecular dynamics (MD) method. The effects of temperature and pore size on the diffusion performance were investigated. The three aromatic hydrocarbons were distributed parallel to the pore surface through electrostatic interactions. The Arrhenius equation can accurately fit the relationship between temperature and the self-diffusion coefficient, and the calculated diffusion activation energy shows that the diffusivity of the larger molecules is more sensitive to temperature variation. Furthermore, the self-diffusion coefficients of three aromatic hydrocarbons and their corresponding dynamic diameters show a good linear relationship. The larger molecules showed smaller variations in their self-diffusion coefficients with an increase in pore size. The results reported herein provide theoretical guidance for the characterization of the diffusion behavior of different aromatics in catalyst pores. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mist filters: How steady is their "steady state"?
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Filtration; Oil mist; Coalescence filter; Pressure drop; Steady state
ID PRESSURE-DROP; LIQUID DISTRIBUTION; FILTRATION; SATURATION; AEROSOLS;
   MOTION
AB This paper addresses the phenomenon of a slow Delta p increase ("creep") sometimes observed in mist filters during their so-called steady-state operation, especially at relatively high flow rates and aerosol loads (Kolb et al., 2017). This creep phenomenon draws into question the concept of steady state and awaits a physical explanation on the basis of more systematic data. The present study was performed with conventional glass microfiber filter media at filter face velocities in the range of 1-70 cm/s, using submicron oil aerosol at loading rates up to 1.1 g/(m(2) s). Experiments started either with a dry filter (designated as S-0 = 0, where S stands for the liquid saturation level), or with a completely pre-saturated filter (designated as S-0 = 1). The S-0 = 0 runs reached "steady state" (defined here as the onset of drainage) after approximately 0.3 h and were then loaded continually for another 100 h. Runs starting at S-0 =1 reached a steady state very quickly.
   With regard to Delta p, all filters featured Delta p creep when starting from S-0 = 0. For coarse filter grades, Delta p creep effectively ended in less than 40 h at moderate flow velocities; finer grades crept further and did not stop creeping within any reasonable loading time. When starting from S-0 = 1, a steady Delta p endpoint was reached rapidly, but was considerably higher than the level attained by creep. It was further shown that creep is associated with a slow increase in the saturation level and that S approached the (higher) level of pre-saturated filters. The increase in S during creep was associated with the formation of additional fine oil channels. Conversely, oil channels were completely absent in pre-saturated filters and the liquid was uniformly dispersed. Using simple theoretical considerations for flow in porous media, the observed differences in Delta p are explained in part by the difference in S betweenS(0) = 0 and S-0 =1 filters, and in additionally also by taking into account the different liquid distribution patterns.
   We conclude that the onset of drainage under steady external conditions - the stage conventionally viewed as the beginning of steady-state operation - does not automatically represent an internal steady state with regard to saturation levels or pressure drop; and presumably also not for the oil distribution pattern. The internal saturation reaches a stable endpoint sooner than the pressure drop, which may continue to creep for the lifetime of the filter. Of and when a transition from channel patterns to homogeneous oil distribution occurs during steady operation is not known. However, the transition can be forced rather quickly by operating the filter intermittently at a very low flow velocity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Development of absorbents with large absorption capacities is important for improvements in the CO2 capture technology. Polyamines include more than two amine groups in their molecular structures and may exhibit great potential as candidate solvents. In this study, CO2 solubility and speciation in aqueous 3,3'-iminobis(N,N-dimethylpropylamine) (IBDMPA) was experimentally investigated and a chemical equilibrium reaction model was proposed. Solubility measurements were conducted at four different IBDMPA contents (9.37, 18.7, 31.6 and 37.5 mass%) in the temperature range from 40 to 120 degrees C and CO 2 partial pressure in the range of from 2 kPa to 480 kPa. In addition, both proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques were employed for the quantitative and qualitative analyses of various species in CO2-loaded solutions. Using these experimental results, a chemical equilibrium reaction model was developed for the IBDMPA-H2O-CO2 system based on the electrolyte NRTL model. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have attracted tremendous attention in the field of gas separation, which adopts the synergistic advantages of the polymer and inorganic phase. However, the MMMs rarely generate sufficient selectivity for energy-efficient gas separation, even if the dispersed molecular sieve is highly selective. Here, an unprecedented improvement (similar to 4.5-fold) of both C3H6/C3H8 permeability and selectivity on the crosslinked poly(ethylene oxide) (XLPEO) membranes containing ZIF-8 nanocrystals. When the ratio of polymer-to-sieve permeability (R-c/d) is in the range of 0.004-0.36, both C3H6/C3H8 permeability and selectivity increases with the ZIF-8 loading, and the separation performance on MMMs can approach and surpass the-state-of-the-art polymer upper bound. Besides C3H6/C3H8 separation, the universality of this proposed polymer-sieve matching law is suitable for other gas-pairs on MOF-based MMMs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   methods; Bubble column; Multiphase flow
ID LEAST-SQUARES; MODEL; COALESCENCE; SIMULATION; FLOWS
AB The solution of the population balance equation requires the integration of several source terms. In the numerical weighted residuals methods, Gaussian quadrature is a natural candidate for numerical integration. Previous works using the weighted residuals methods for solving the population balance equation did use a fixed grid of quadrature points. This work shows that the use of adaptive quadrature points for the numerical integration can lead to more efficient and accurate solutions of the equation. For cases where the integrand shows a high degree of irregularity, the hp-optimization method distributes the quadrature points such that the method becomes more efficient than with a fixed grid. An additional improvement is that the amount of quadrature points changes to fit the need for each integral present, rather than having one set of quadrature points for all cases. A simple population balance model demonstrates the use of the adaptive quadrature approach. (C)2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ionic liquids (ILs) have been proved to be excellently potential catalysts and solvents in a few chemical processes. In order to provide fundamental data for the reactor design and process optimization, it is essential to investigate the hydrodynamics and the mass transfer phenomena of liquid-solid twophase systems containing ILs. In this work, we focus on the investigation of the hydrodynamic properties of a spherical particle in ILs, and a series of experiments are implemented in a cylindrical bubble column with three different diameters of spherical particles made of borosilicate glass (2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm) in three kinds of ILs ([Bmim][BE4], [Bmim][PF6] and [Bmim][Tf2N]). Moreover, Two key physical quantities (terminal velocity of particle and contact angle) are measured with a high-speed camera system and an automatic contact angle meter. Based on dimensional analysis, two novel empirical models of the drag coefficient (C-D) between a spherical particle and ILs are developed in the range of particle's Reynolds number (Re) from 0.1 to 85. The first model is simple and the calculated C-D agrees fairly well with the experimental data. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the effects of surface properties on C-D, a newly defined dimensionless number (Mo') is introduced into IL-particle flow studies for the first time, which comes into being a more rigorous model. The average predicted deviations of the two models are +/- 1.1% and +/- 1.5% respectively, which is much lower than that of contrastive models in the same situations (about 13.3% or more). These two models are significant for studying the hydrodynamics and mass transfer characteristics of IL-particle systems as well as the fluid dynamics simulation in related reactors.

AB Small-scale effects of turbulent mixing are numerically investigated by applying the map-based, stochastic, one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model to confined planar jets. The model validation is carried out for the momentum transport by comparing ODT results to available reference data for the bulk Reynolds numbers Re = 20, 000 and 40, 000. Various pointwise statistical quantities are computed and compared to the available reference data. We show that these quantities can be captured well, or at least to a reasonable extent, by the stand-alone model formulation and for fixed model parameters. Only the rootmean-square velocity fluctuations remain systematically underestimated in the ODT results (by an approximate factor of 1.5). Afterwards, the turbulent transport of a passive scalar is addressed for the Schmidt numbers Sc = 1 and 1250. For the high Schmidt number and in contrast to the velocity fluctuations, it is shown that the scalar fluctuation variance is up to ten times larger in the ODT simulations resolving the Batchelor scale. The fluctuation variance is notably smaller for the lower Schmidt number, but exhibits better agreement with the references at a nominally higher Schmidt number. We suggest that this is due to implicit filtering in the references, which barely resolve the Kolmogorov scale. ODT turbulence spectra support this interpretation since a Batchelor-like scalar turbulence spectrum is only observed for the higher Schmidt number. With the aid of these spectra and the fluctuation statistics we conclude that implicit filtering has a similar effect as a reduction of the Schmidt number. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, an efficient ghost-cell based immersed boundary method (IBM) is used to perform direct numerical simulation (DNS) of reactive fluid-particle systems. With an exothermic first order reaction proceeding at the exterior particle surface, the solid temperature rises and consequently increases the reaction rate via an Arrhenius temperature dependence. In other words, the heat and mass transport is dependently coupled through the particle thermal energy equation and the Arrhenius equation, and they offer dynamic boundary conditions for the fluid phase thermal energy equation and species equation respectively. The fluid-solid coupling is enforced at the exact position of the particle surface by implicit incorporation of the boundary conditions into the discretized momentum, species and thermal energy conservation equations of the fluid phase. Different fluid-particle systems are studied with increasing complexity: a single sphere, three spheres and a dense array consisting of hundreds of randomly generated particles. In these systems the mutual impacts between heat and mass transport processes are investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to deeply understand the inherent links between hydrodynamic behaviors and heat transfer enhancement in wavy condensate films, a numerical model using a non-orthogonal coordinate transformation was developed to simulate the evolution of wavy films. A sinusoidal disturbance was introduced by a fictitious body force to sustain waves. Two major pressure gradients are established at the wave front. One parallel to the stream-wise direction accelerates fluids and the other normal to the wall increases the normal velocity. The temperature profiles prove that both convection and conduction contribute microscopic mechanisms to heat transfer enhancement in the condensate films. The normal velocity close to the wall significantly influences the temperature gradient at the wall. The predicted heat transfer coefficient for the wavy film was found to be 30% greater than the Nusselt solution for the given parameters. Under the given conditions, the effects of film thinning and convection account for 6% and 24% of the heat transfer enhancement, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Developing, verifying and validating sub-grid methods is of crucial significance for enabling accurate coarse-grained two-fluid modeling of rapid gas-fluidized flows. However, very few studies in the literature so far have been focused on how the sub-grid modification depends on material properties. As an extension of previous sub-grid efforts, this fundamental investigation attempts to derive a materialproperty-dependent drag modification based on generated data from an initially homogeneous state of periodic gas-particle suspensions. The newly constituted model is then verified by highly-resolved two-fluid simulation results. We further validate the accuracy of model predictions via systematic assessments to experimental results that encompass a wide variety of material properties in five three-dimensional large-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers. Besides, we introduce a deviation index (DI) to quantify the predictive capability of the extended model. Computational results demonstrate an essential dependence of drag correction on material properties as an additional factor. Hydrodynamic validation predictions achieve satisfactory accordance with experiments. The current model is potential to serve as a more general tool for efficiently reducing the number of pilot-scale tests and effectively designing and controlling industrial process devices.

AB Positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) has been shown to be useful for flow interrogation in opaque systems. In this work, a recently developed method for multiple-particle PEPT (M-PEPT) is employed for measurement of flow in a pipe at Rep = 42 600, and results are compared to direct numerical simulation (DNS) data to test the capability of M-PEPT for measurement of statistical quantities in turbulent flow. Correction for photon depth of interaction in detectors is seen to be needed and is applied. M-PEPT is shown to be capable of measuring quantities such as mean velocity and acceleration, Reynolds stress, and turbulent kinetic energy budget outside of the near-wall region. Further refinement of the technique is needed to resolve near-wall turbulence features. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Pharmaceutical hot melt extrusion; Scale-up; SPH; 1D mechanistic process

AB The goal of our study was to develop a rational in silico scale-up and process transfer approach for hot melt extrusion processes occurring in the pharmaceutical and other industries. To that end, we performed high-fidelity simulations of individual twin-screw extruder elements via the Lagrangian-based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. To parametrize a mechanistic 1D hot-melt extrusion (HME) model, the data generated by the SPH simulations was used together with the material properties. Two co-rotating twin-screw extruder setups were compared: the Coperion ZSK18 and the Leistritz MIC27 extruders. The pressure and power characteristics of the two extruders with different screw elements and geometries were obtained and compared. The impact of the HME process parameters (throughput, screw speed and barrel temperature) on the filling degree, melt temperature, axial specific mechanical energy consumption (SMEC) and residence time distribution in the two extruders was established. The torque and SMEC values obtained in silico were then compared to experiments to ensure that the 1D HME simulations were set up correctly.
   Next, scale-up methods from the literature were evaluated, yielding an unsatisfactory set of process parameters that might lead to material degradation. Finally, a rational scale-up approach was proposed. Based on this novel method alternative parameter settings on the MIC27 extruder were established, assuring equivalent thermo-mechanical load on the product compared to the process using the ZSK18 extruder.

AB Emulsification of a high viscosity oil in water mixture was studied in a rotor-stator mixer. Experimental characterization of drop sizes and high-speed visualizations of drop breakup phenomena were performed, combined with computational fluid dynamics analysis of the flow field and population balance modeling. Single-phase flow simulations were carried out with a sliding mesh CFD model and combined with analysis of streamlines, turbulent eddy dissipation fields and high-speed visualizations of drop breakage. From frames taken over few seconds, with the oil-water system initially fully segregated, three drop breakage mechanisms were identified, supported by the CFD analysis: (i) a combination of the large scale circular motion in the tank and the fluid jet emanating from the stator holes; (ii) droplets that are pulled into the rotor - stator system from the bottom and flow through the gap between the stator and rotor, undergoing extremely high shear stresses, being expelled through the stator slots in several fragments, and iii) droplets that remain caught at the recirculation zones in the stator holes, increasing exposure time to high shear during the rotor blade passage. Finally, an optimization algorithm was coupled to a population balance model and the measured drop size distributions were reproduced in good agreement with experimental data, including the bimodal behavior attributed to the generation of satellite droplets.

AB A new model for determining maximum-efficiency inlet velocity in the gas-solid cyclone separator was developed analytically in this study. Previous maximum-efficiency inlet velocity (V-MEIV) models are derived at normal temperature and do not function properly under high-temperature conditions. The new model not only accounts for gas physical properties and cyclone structure dimensions, but also various particle characteristics as well as temperature; it can be applied to predict V-MEIV at both normal and high temperatures. Based on Yang's model, a hard sphere analogy of the soft sphere model was used to directly manage particle-wall collision as per the flow field of the cyclone. This model yields more accurate downward flow region width information than previously proposed models. If the radial displacement of a rebounded particle after collision is equal to the width of the downward flow region, then the corresponding inlet velocity is defined as the maximum-efficiency inlet velocity. Comparisons among different experimental results and other models' results indicate that the proposed model more accurately predicts maximum-efficiency inlet velocity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An analytical expression for the dispersion coefficient in an electro-osmotic flow of a viscoelastic fluid (which obeys the simplified Phan-Thien-Tanner rheological model) through a porous-walled microchannel is theoretically developed. The decomposition technique in combination with the assumptions behind the Taylor-Aris theory of the solute species dispersion is used to derive the dispersion coefficient in a porous-walled microchannel. The microchannel-porous medium interaction via the exchange of the solute species between the two media is included in derivation of the dispersion coefficient in a porous-walled microchannel. In other words, the continuity of the solute species concentration and its flux is considered at the interface between the microchannel and the porous medium. The developed dispersion coefficient in a porous-walled microchannel is a function of three parameters, which characterize the Peclet number, the fluid elasticity, and the nondimensional Debye-Flfickel parameter. The proposed model is also capable to deliver the dispersion coefficient in a nonporous-walled microchannel (where a no-flux boundary condition is considered at the walls), which is in agreement with the existing model in literature.

AB The objective of this work is the development of a model to predict the separation efficiency of structured packings for aqueous viscous systems. The modelling approach is based on a hydrodynamic analogy between the real complex flow patterns and simplified fluid dynamic elements. Understanding of dominating liquid flow patterns inside structured packing is essential for the model development. Therefore, in this work, X-ray tomography is used to investigate liquid flow morphology. To study the influence of viscosity, water and water/glycerine mixtures are employed as working liquids.
   X-ray tomography permits the spatial distribution of liquid in the cross-section of a column filled with MellapakPlus 752.Y packing elements to be determined. The resulting images are used to evaluate liquid hold-up and gas-liquid interfacial area. Furthermore, liquid flow patterns (film flow, contact-point liquid, flooded regions) are identified, and their contribution to the overall hold-up is determined in dependence on flow rate and liquid viscosity.
   The results of the liquid flow morphology analysis help to develop a hydrodynamic analogy model. To implement the gas-liquid contact area and the flooded regions into this model, the packing is represented as a bundle of dry, filled and irrigated cylindrical channels, while the ratio between different channel types is determined from the analysis of tomographic images. This simplified hydrodynamic description allows a direct application of rigorous partial differential transport equations, and their solution yields local concentration fields which are used for the evaluation of the separation efficiency.
   The new modelling approach is validated by comparison with separation efficiency data obtained from experiments with CO2 desorption from saturated water-glycerine mixtures into air. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In solution crystallization, solvent has a profound effect on controlling crystal morphology. However, the role played by solvents in affecting crystal morphology remains elusive. Here, we accompany experiments with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate crystallization of an anti-tuberculosis drug, isoniazid, in different solvents. Experiments show that isoniazid grows as needle-like crystals in water, while in alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, it exhibits a rod-like crystal habit. The aspect ratio of isoniazid crystals decreases with the decrease in the relative solvent polarity. We modeled these experiments by performing molecular dynamics simulations of isoniazid crystallization in different solvents at constant chemical potential thus keeping the solution concentration constant. The simulation results reveal a rough growth mechanism for the fast growing (1 1 0) surface, and bulk transport of the solute from solution to the growing surface is the limiting-step. In accordance with experiments, the relative growth rate of this surface decreases from methanol, ethanol to isopropanol. On the other hand, the slow growing (0 0 2) surface appears to follow a stepwise growth mechanism, with a surface integration step chiefly controlling the growth. The relative growth rate of this surface increases from methanol to ethanol and isopropanol. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PROCESS INTEGRATION
AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) has significant potential as a chemical feedstock as it is an abundant source of carbon atoms, entails zero or negative acquisition costs and utilization reduces environmental impact. However, significant challenges remain as the use of this feedstock involves unfavorable thermodynamics in reaction and separation, material transportation and end use application. Opportunities exist to overcome these limitations especially within eco-industrial parks which involve a group of facilities cooperating by exchanging materials and energy. An important class of EIPs, Carbon-Hydrogen-Oxygen SYmbiosis Networks (CHOSYN), has been recently introduced to integrate hydrocarbon streams from multiple plants while allowing for chemical conversion (in addition to the conventional exchange, separation, and allocation) through a multiscale targeting approach. The objective of this work is to address the problem of designing a CHOSYN with the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals while reducing the carbon footprint for the whole system. A multi-scale synthesis and optimization approach is proposed. First, atomic-level information coupled with economic data are used to establish benchmarks for the utilization of process streams, the purchase of external sources, and the discharge of CO2. A presynthesis approach is adopted to develop optimal policies for the CO2-separation technologies. Candidate CO2-utilization reactions are integrated with the existing plants to produce value-added chemicals while addressing economic and environmental objectives. Carbon-footprint constraints are added based on life-cycle analysis of the used sources and energy associated with the various reaction and separation steps. This systematic procedure captures significant interactions between surrounding CO2 sources and CO2 sinks while reducing the difficulty of selection and design of the CO2 capture process. A case study is developed and solved to demonstrate the application of this new method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A series of sonofragmentation experiments were performed by varying the sonication time and ultrasonic amplitude in order to investigate and simulate the two-dimensional ultrasound-assisted breakage of delta-form of pyrazinamide crystals using Monte Carlo (MC) method. An event driven constant number MC algorithm is presented to predict the evolution of two-dimensional size distribution of the product crystals. The MC simulations were performed by considering the breakage across the width of the particles and restricting the randomness of the break up point to a particular region along the length axis. The results obtained are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. The proposed MC method reproduces both mode and span of the experimental size distribution with remarkable accuracy for all the cases. Further, it has only one tuning parameter depending on the ultrasonic amplitude. A graphical correlation has been obtained for selection of this tuning parameter for a given ultrasonic amplitude. Thus the proposed MC approach can be used to obtain quantitative view about the effect of sonofragmentation of two-dimensional plate-like crystals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The catalytic activity of Cu/zeolites with different types of zeolite frameworks (SSZ-13, ZSM-5, and BETA) was investigated in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with n-C4H10. The Cu content and zeolite framework significantly affected the catalytic performance in the C4H10-SCR process, where the lowCu-impregnated medium-pore ZSM-5 structure (2Cu/ZSM-5) exhibited the optimal de-NOx performance, followed by the high- and medium Cu-impregnated large- and small-pore BETA and SSZ-13 zeolites (10Cu/BETA and 5Cu/SSZ-13), respectively. The effects of coexistent gases (CO(2 )and O-2) and hydrothermal aging were also evaluated for 2Cu/ZSM-5. CO2 in the feed gas induced an unfavorable effect on NOx reduction because it competed with NO and C4H10 adsorption on the catalyst surface. O-2 in the feed gas had a positive effect on NOx conversion, CO oxidation, and partial oxidation of C4H10, and N-2 selectivity was highly affected by the O-2 concentration, producing a large amount of NH3 in the absence of O-2. The deactivation of the catalytic activity after hydrothermal aging was attributed to collapse of the pore structures and a drop in the zeolite crystallinity. However, there was no catalytic deactivation due to the coke formation by hydrocarbons within 24 h in the steady-state stability test. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The combination of enzymatic and chemical reactions to achieve co-operative chemo-enzymatic processes has presented many challenges for decades. In this work, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was encapsulated into metal-organic framework HKUST-1 crystals through an in situ approach to construct a synergistic chemo- and bio-catalysis system, where ADH was for the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and HKUST-1 was in charge for the regeneration of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+), the oxidized cofactor). It was found that HKUST-1 was a versatile catalyst for efficient oxidation of NADH in different buffers. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters of immobilized ADH exhibited an increased K-M (approximately 1.3-fold) and a decreased V-max (approximately 4.7-fold) compared to free ADH. Due to the protection of HKUST-1, the immobilized enzyme showed a better resistance against urea and organic solvents compared with free enzyme, and still maintained 93% of its original activity after 6 cycles. The immobilized enzyme was successfully applied to the enzymatic transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in aqueous media at room temperature. Owing to the oxidized cofactor regeneration by HKUST-1, ADH@HKUST-1 composites achieved a benzaldehyde yield of 28.5%, which was approximately 4.3-fold higher than that of the individual bio-catalysis. This concept of combining chemo- and bio-catalysis may provide a novel and versatile technique for applications in biochemical catalysis, biosensors and drug delivery. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent advances in nanotube synthesis and functionalization have allowed for new insights into several physical-chemical aspects of nanofluidics. Processes thought possible only in theory are now attainable experimentally. This raises new questions about the distinctions between fluid behavior in bulk or under extreme confinement. Particularly, the interaction between water molecules and the nanotube wall is expected to play a major role in fluid structure and dynamics. In fact, the very definition of surface hydrophobicity is a sensitive subject, which demands further investigation. Here we present an overview of how changes in interaction and confining distances between water molecules and the nanotube wall can induce freezing, wet/dry transitions and even produce high flow rates. We suggest that the changes in water dynamics due to wall's nature (if hydrophobic or hydrophilic or mixed) indicates that polarity is the key factor for the high mobility of confined water.

AB The achievement of low oxygen partial pressures is beneficial in a number of applications, including the production of nitrogen for the Habor-Bosch process, one of the largest industrial chemical processes. It has been suggested in the literature that a redox cycle can be utilized for selective oxygen adsorption, with the potential for application in oxygen separation and compression processes. In this work we demonstrate this concept and show the feasibility of using a temperature and pressure swing redox cycle to chemically absorb oxygen gas at a low partial pressure of 10(-6) bar. The redox material used was the perovskite oxide SrFeO3, chosen for its relatively low reduction temperature and strong oxygen affinity. The material's intrinsic thermodynamics and low temperature kinetics were both investigated using thermogravimetric analysis. Multiple reduction and oxidation experiments were conducted, with oxidation performed under both synthetic air and inert gas with 1% O-2 concentration. The results show successful trials of oxygen removal resulting in inert gasses with ppm level oxygen impurities and no degradation of the material over multiple cycles. Thermodynamic considerations suggest that with further development this technology could offer a very attractive, reversible cycle for the removal of oxygen impurities from gas streams, particularly in combination with conventional pressure swing adsorption.

AB In this work the differences between the formulation of reaction rate equations for equilibrium limited reactions in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems are investigated. A rigorous derivation for equilibrium limited gas-solid reactions is proposed based on the core ideas of homogeneous gas phase reactions. The resulting reaction rate expression allows for two distinct reaction rate mechanisms for the forward and reverse reaction direction and is, therefore, valid in both reaction directions. The thermodynamic consistency and the validity of the proposed reaction rate expression is shown using a simple reactor model. The results are compared to traditional reaction rate expressions and it is explained why they are not able to appropriately describe the true reaction behavior in some cases. The implications and use cases for process modeling are investigated and suggestions are proposed for solving numerical challenges associated with the proposed reaction rate equations.

AB The solubility constant of N2O in aqueous 1-dimethylamino-2-propanol (1DMA2P) solution in the concentration range of 0-3.0 mol/L was measured over the temperature range of 298-333 K, and the data used to fit existing models: Redlich-lister, semi-empirical, and polynomial. A new model has also been developed to predict the solubility constant. Also, N2O diffusivity in aqueous 1DMA2P solution was measured over the concentration range of 0.5-2.0 mol/L and temperature range of 298-313 K. All models used fitted the solubility constant of N2O solubility in 1DMA2P solution data with absolute average deviations (ADDs) for the Redlich-Kister, semi-empirical, polynomial models and a new model of 12.2%, 8.1%, 0.2% and 2.2%, respectively. The data for N2O diffusivity in aqueous 1DMA2P solution were represented by the modified Stokes-Einstein and semi-empirical models (AADs of 2.3% and 13.6%, respectively). A new mechanism-based model was equally developed to better correlate experimental results and understand the process of diffusivity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fluidization of non-spherical particles commonly exists in the biomass utilization and municipal solid waste (MSW) processing industries. In this study, cylindrical particles are used as a typical type of non-spherical particle and its orientation distribution is investigated when being co-fluidized with small spherical bed material. X-ray particle tracking velocimetry (XPTV), based on an X-ray stereography imaging system, is used to measure the 3D orientation of a single tracer particle over a long time period in the fluidized bed. The effects of gas velocity (u(f)), cylindrical particle mass fraction (omega), particle sphericity (Phi), and bed material size on the orientation distribution of the cylindrical particle are investigated and discussed in detail. An orientation distribution probability density function (PDF) model is proposed based on all experimental results.
   The distribution probability P of the angle between the cylindrical particle central axis and vertical direction lambda across the bed shows two minima in the ranges 0 degrees <= lambda< 10 degrees and 40 degrees <= lambda < 50 degrees, and two maxima in the ranges 20 degrees <= lambda < 30 degrees and 70 degrees <= lambda < 80 degrees. Increasing u(f) reduces lambda, while the effect of particle sphericity Phi and cylindrical particle mass fraction omega increases with increasing u(f). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nanoscale structured composite particles consisting of spherical porous SiO2 particles with nanoscaled surface roughness as the core particles and SiO2 nanoparticles as the depositing particles were designed using a high-shear mechanical composing process to develop a powder material that can form a layer with apparent rapid drying properties. The spherical porous SiO2 core particles and depositing nanoparticles were selected to enhance the water extension on the core particle surface and amongst the composite particles in the powder layer, respectively. The effects of the composite particle nanoparticle content on the morphology of the composite particles and their relationships with the water droplet extending and drying properties in the powder layer of the designed composite particles were systematically investigated based on FE-SEM observations, characterization of N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, and H-1 spin-spin relaxation rate measurements of composite particles. The FE-SEM observations show that the pulverized nanoparticles could be successfully attached to porous core particles without the core particles collapsing. The reduction of the specific surface area and increase of the particle specific external surface area after the compositing process strongly supported the fact of nanoparticle attachment. While a small amount of nanoparticle attachment decreased the water droplet extended area, wet area circularity, and apparent drying rate, 15 wt% loading of the pulverized nanoparticles resulted in a drastic increase of the water extended area, wet area circularity, and apparent drying rate.

AB In this study, the creeping motions of core-shell particles at low-Reynolds numbers were analyzed and discussed in three cases: (i) a freely translating particle; (ii) a particle in a concentric hole; (iii) particles in a monodisperse suspension. The core and shell were assumed concentric and consist of immiscible liquids. The results revealed the particle motions were significantly influenced by the radius (or volume fraction) and viscosity of the shell and core, especially the shell viscosity. In the limiting situations, our general results for two-phase particles could be simplified to the studies of single-phase particles (solid, liquid or gas bubble) in literature. For the case of a freely suspending particle with the same volume fraction of shell and core, the modified coefficient was reduced by more than 30% as the dimensionless shell viscosity reduced from 100 to 0.01 at eta(c)* =1; however, the coefficient was only slightly reduced by less than 1.5% as the dimensionless core viscosity reduced from 100 to 0.01 at eta(s)* = 1. For the translation of a particle in a concentric hole, the boundary effect of the cavity wall performed to significantly hinder the particle motion. When the volume fraction of the particle in the hole was 0.01 and 0.1, in the case of a(21) = 1.25, eta(c)* = 1 and eta(s)* = 0.01, the boundary effect retarded the particle velocity to 2/3 and 1/3 of the free particle velocity, respectively. In a monodisperse system, the mean translational velocity of particles was hindered by the hydrodynamic interaction between the particles, and the hindrance effect increased as the particle concentration increased. Particle concentration and shell viscosity were the main properties affecting the fluid dynamics of the suspension. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a multiphase level set (MLS) approach to capillary-controlled, three-phase displacement in porous media, and use it to simulate displacements of disconnected fluid ganglia surrounded by two other fluid phases (i.e., double displacements), which are important pore-scale mechanisms for oil recovery and CO2 storage. After a comprehensive model validation on several new benchmark cases, including 3-D simulations of double displacements in a straight angular tube, we show two new applications of the MLS method. First, we simulate three-phase capillary pressure curves for gas invasion along constant oil saturation paths in sandstone. The results show significant oil redistribution by double displacements, which leads to fluctuations of gas/oil capillary pressure due to oil volume preservation, whereas oil/water capillary pressure increases mostly monotonically, yet the pressure level is lower than in the corresponding two-phase oil/water system. Further, gas/water capillary pressure is lower when mobile oil is present in the sample. The second application demonstrates the suitability of MLS method to describe foam dynamics both with and without oil present in the pore space. MLS method successfully describes well-known foam interfacial properties, and it also captures the rise of displacement capillary pressure when adding gas bubbles between continuous gas and water inside a pore channel.

AB The efficient selective oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol (KA-oil) under mild conditions remains one of the most challenging and interesting projects in catalytic chemistry. Here, photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexane was carried out in acetonitrile (MeCN) solution of VOCl2 under Xe lamp irradiation and pure O-2 atmosphere. The results show that VOCl2 has high photocatalytic activity in pure MeCN solution, and a cyclohexane conversion of 17.8% with ca. 99% selectivity for KA-oil can be obtained after light irradiation of 4 h. It is worth noting that the use of hydrochloric acid as an additive can effectively enhance the photo-catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane, providing a cyclohexane conversion of 23.3%, which may be due to the important role of HCl in improving the light absorption, decreasing the oxidation-reduction potential of V5+/V4+ and promoting the redox process of photocatalyst. The effects of photocatalyst concentration, hydrochloric acid addition amount, O-2 pressure and reaction time on photocatalytic performance were also studied. It was found that the optimization of these reaction conditions can further improve the conversion of cyclohexane and selectivity of KA-oil. A possible reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexane was proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Even if the suitability of Finite Volume discretization methods for Pressure Swing Adsorption modelling is well-established, when simulating the peculiar process called Dual Reflux-Pressure Swing Adsorption, simulations relying only on Finite Difference discretization methods are available in literature. Therefore, a detailed single-bed model of the Dual Reflux-Pressure Swing Adsorption process, the solution of which is based on the Finite Volume discretization method, is proposed in this work and validated against experimental data. Details of the system representation, the numerical schemes and the implementation of the boundary conditions are given. Moreover, a comparison between the performances and limitations of the Finite Volume and Finite Difference discretization methods when simulating a Dual Reflux-Pressure Swing Adsorption process are discussed through two case studies, leading to conclude that Finite Volume Method is the most effective approach for simulating this specific separation process.

AB Atherosclerosis induces abnormal blood-flow patterns in coronary arteries mainly because of the irregular accumulation of fibrofatty plaque on the artery walls. Morphological alterations of the wall-surface attributes downgrade vascular elasticity, which compromises the normal blood-pressure gradient behavior by sporadically interfering with the effective-flow cross-section adjustment. An iron-oxide booster has been recently studied as a potential nano-particle treatment to regulate an elevated blood-pressure condition. Taguchi-type multi-factorial experimentation rapidly generates small and dense datasets in order to expedite arterial flow screening/optimization predictions. The optimal blood pressure-drop performance is investigated against four vital controlling factors. We show that tracking down inherently complex blood-flow phenomena often entails the elucidation of non-linear and messy data structures. Translating such data demands robust and agile techniques to decipher governing relationships while guarding against spurious effects from uncertainty asymmetry. We also show that by using distribution-free profiling, we may synchronously accomplish the screening and optimization tasks more accurately in comparison to other competing techniques. Illustrating our technique on a chemical engineering paradigm, we found that out of the four investigated factors only the blood behavior index to be strongly influential. A blood behavior index setting of 0.5, which is below the normal physiological limit, minimizes the blood pressure drop at an optimal value of 385 Pa/m. The proposed methodology demonstrates how the required sampling size may be further reduced, thus making the study even more economically and practically efficient. This was shown to be achieved without relinquishing important information about the dominant phenomena, hence rendering our solution to be also lean and agile. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, the application of small channels to the extraction separations in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing has been investigated via a modelling approach. The results are compared with conventional liquid-liquid extraction technologies such as mixer-settlers and pulsed columns, using models from the literature.
   In the model mass transfer, redox reactions, pressure drop and nuclear criticality are taken into account, as well as manifold and two-phase separator designs for the small-scale technology. The resulting model, posed as an optimisation problem, is a mixed integer nonlinear problem, implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS).
   An alternative flowsheet for the codecontamination section of the PUREX process, as a case study, has been investigated. The results show that the small-scale technology could be beneficial, in particular in terms of volumetric mass transfer coefficients, nuclear criticality safety and short residence time, which improves neptunium separation and reduces solvent degradation.

AB The separation of alkanes-olefins plays an essential role in petrochemical industry and is also challenging because of their similar physicochemical properties, especially for halogenated alkanes-olefins mixtures. In this work, we quickly screened a series of zeolites to separate 1-chloropropane/allyl chloride (C3H7Cl/C3H5Cl) mixture by molecular simulation. The results show that zeolites with specific pore geometry (e.g., AHT type) only adsorb C3H7Cl thus C3H7Cl can be selectively separated from C3H7Cl completely. These zeolites have one-dimensional elliptical pores with similar sizes, which match with the low energy conformation of C3H5Cl. The flux data of membrane based on these zeolites were also investigated, which confirmed that they can separate C3H7Cl and C3H7Cl with an ultrahigh selectivity. Based on the thermodynamics analysis, we proposed a pore geometry based conformation recognition mechanism of this special adsorption and separation phenomena. In conclusion, this paper provides an avenue to design or screen nano-porous materials for alkanes-olefins separation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Solution blow spinning (SBS) is examined in this work as a platform method for creating MOF-bearing fiber composites for application in separations and catalysis. Composite fibers were produced from MOF suspensions in polymer solutions and examined for both MOF stability and accessibility. The composites were found to have more MOF accessibility than bulk polymers, but adsorption was hindered by the formation of a glassy polymer skin. The fibers were found to have better accessibility to water vapor and carbon dioxide at room temperature compared to nitrogen adsorption at 77 K, suggesting that they may be applicable for gases that have high permeability in the polymer. MOF-polymer fibers produced by SBS provide an interesting platform for delivery of different MOFs to target a variety of applications, particularly those requiring scale-up or in-situ production. Ultimately, this system combines a low-hazard, low-cost polymer and a highly stable MOF to enable a systematic evaluation of the effects of the process on the accessibility of active materials. Going forward, an examination of a broader set of polymers and MOFs is necessary to further characterize and optimize this method and to create and refine synergy between the MOF and the polymer.

AB Fundamental understanding of heterogeneously catalyzed aerobic, base-free oxidation of glycerol is highly desirable for sustainable and highly efficient chemical synthesis. In this work, Pt/CNTs catalyzed base-free oxidation of glycerol is investigated by combining experiments, DFT calculations and kinetics analysis. The solvent effects and kinetic isotope effects measurements as well as DFT calculations reveal that water-assisted O-2 activation to form active OH* intermediates is not in rate-determining step (RDS) but in equilibrium. Then, Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models are developed and fitted with the experimental data. The OH*-assisted C-H bond cleavage of glycerol is discriminated as the RDS for the two parallel oxidation pathways of glycerol via primary or secondary hydroxyl groups, where the former case exhibits lower activation energy. The insights revealed here could guide the design and optimization of this catalytic process to generate the targeted products. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The treatment of various kinds of oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions is increasingly desired but is still a considerable challenge. Although traditional two-dimensional superwetting separation materials have been widely studied, they still suffer from disadvantages such as single wettability and low separation flux. In this work, three-dimensional hollow porous rape pollen with switchable wettability was fabricated via simple solvent extraction and subsequent calcination using the pristine rape pollen as starting material. The obtained rape pollen was developed into a superwetting rape pollen layer, which achieves controllable wettability transition between hydrophobicity/underwater superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity/underoil superhydrophilicity via calcination and steam modification alternately, without the addition of toxic modification reagents. Moreover, the wettability of rape pollens could be reversibly switched for many times. The obtained rape pollen layer can be used for on-demand separation of various oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions in one single device. After calcination, the hydrophobic/underwater superoleophilic rape pollen layer can absorb tiny oil droplets from oil-in-water emulsion, and the wetting properties can be rapidly switched to be superhydrophilicity/underoil superhydrophilicity to capture the water droplets from water-in-oil emulsion, with both high separation efficiency and separation flux. This work not only provides a novel emulsion separation approach that is different from membrane separation, but also has high potential in practical applications relating to wastewater treatment, fuel purification, microfluidics, and so on.

AB The vision of a pathway to a sustainable society is based on the three-pillar conception of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) that is expected to result in a significant improvement in the reliability, security, and affordability of energy, materials, water, and food. This pathway should include launching a multidisciplinary and least-cost strategy to move from today's carbon-based economy toward a sustainable economy and, at the same time, to provide the needed energy, water, food, and materials for present and future generations. It is imperative that chemical engineers do not relinquish their leadership role in research and development as global energy systems continue to evolve in a historical cycle from primary reliance on wood to coal and oil, to current reliance on natural gas as a transitional fuel in contributing to a pathway to sustainable global energy systems. Although multidisciplinary research and development is needed to move forward on a pathway to sustainability, in this paper, specific areas of research and development are discussed in which chemical engineers should assume a leadership role or become major contributors in this critical initiative. These areas include, but are not limited to: carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration; process intensification; material recycling; water management and desalination; biofuel; natural gas production and conversion; energy storage; and renewable energy, including concentrated solar energy use in chemical, pharmaceutical, and biological processes, and advanced materials for photovoltaics.

AB A 3D numerical study is performed to investigate the hydrodynamics of droplet generation in microfluidic cross-junctions with different junction angles theta. Four flow regimes during droplet generation are identified, namely squeezing, dripping, jetting and threading, and the regime diagrams are plotted to represent them. Droplet generation performance changes with the flow regime, especially when theta deviates from 90 degrees. In addition, variation in theta changes the hydrodynamic characteristics in and around the cross-junction region, which can affect its interface profile and evolution. However, it is insufficient to fundamentally alter the flow regimes under the current conditions. Considering the length of the dispersed phase entering and blocking the main channel of the cross-junction, as well as the influence of theta on the hydrodynamics of droplet generation, a scaling correlation is developed to predict the size of the generated droplets under the squeezing regime in the microfluidic cross-junction.

AB This paper focuses on the application range and optimal parameters for separating water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions using ultrasonic standing waves (USWs). Firstly, the effect of droplet bandings on the demulsification process is theoretically analyzed. The formation of droplet bandings coincides with droplet sedimentation when horizontal irradiation is applied, which improves the separation efficiency. On this basis, the effects of acoustic parameters and oil-water properties on demulsification are analyzed in detail. It is shown that ultrasonic treatment is an efficient demulsification method, and that maximum demulsification efficiency can be achieved by optimizing the acoustic intensity and treatment time. Excessive acoustic intensity causes acoustic cavitation in low-frequency USWs and acoustic streaming in high-frequency USWs, resulting in a low separation efficiency. Acoustic cavitation also causes secondary emulsification, dispersing tiny oil droplets into separated water. In addition, ultrasonic separation is significantly affected by oil-water properties. The demulsification efficiency of W/O emulsions decreases with increasing oil viscosity and decreasing oil-water interfacial tension. Ultrasonic treatment has significant advantages for separation of emulsions with low water content and interfacial tension. This study presents an in-depth analysis of ultrasonic separation.

AB The standard Dusty Gas Model (DGM) for multicomponent diffusion in a porous medium assumes a single pore size in the domain. It is more appropriate to consider a distribution of pore sizes, which is addressed in this article. It derives a general form for the DGM that accounts for any pore size distribution of the porous medium. A few numerical examples demonstrate the strength of the general model. It predicts different diffusive behaviors for diverse pore size distributions possessing the same mean size. Specifically, the bimodal nature of the distribution exhibits a greater effect. The article further elucidates on the effects of the temperature and the pore size dependent variable tortuosity. All the phenomena are backed by physical arguments. The article concludes by recognizing the need for new targeted experiments for further validation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the working performance of structured-packing columns on offshore floating platforms, the effects of different typical ship motions on the mass-transfer area of a column with M250X structured-packing were measured with an Air-NaOH system. A pilot-scale column with an 800 mm diameter was adopted, and tilt, roll, heave and sway motion were mimicked by a six-degree-offreedom parallel platform. The mass-transfer area was affected differently for each type of motion depending on the operating conditions. Therein, the gas velocity was the key factor that the mass-transfer area was more likely to decrease with a high gas velocity in all cases. For typical motions, their influences on the mass-transfer area were different, which were associated with moving periods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metal-based catalysts present highly efficient catalytic activities towards organic dyes and their intermediates for color removal. However, several issues are needed to be addressed urgently for their large-scale practical applications, such as the cost, stability and recyclable use of these catalysts. In this work, we developed a facile approach to chelate Cu ions on the polydopamine-coated sand (Cu-PDA@Sand) and investigated their catalytic properties towards the decoloration of organic dyes or intermediate including 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), methylene blue (MB), and congo red (CR). Our results found that the copper ions from Cu-PDA@Sand were the mixture of Cu (I) and Cu (II), and the molar fraction of Cu (I) over Cu (II) was increased from the original 3:2 to 4:1 in the presence of NaBH4. The reduction of these organic dyes or intermediate followed the first order kinetics, and the apparent reduction rate k up of CR was larger than that of MB and 4-NP under similar conditions. Additionally, the optimized k up of 4-NP could reach to 1.28 min (1), which is much higher than the reported results from literature. The recyclability test of CuPDA@Sand showed that the reduction efficiency of Cu-PDA@Sand maintained 100% during the successive 20 cycles. Additionally, Cu-PDA@Sand was demonstrated to present long-term stability and catalytic activities after soaking Cu-PDA@Sand in water for 30 days. Our research demonstrated that the easy-prepared low-cost Cu-PDA@Sand catalyst would have a great potential in the practical applications for color removal of the dye-containing wastewater.

AB The focus of this work is to study the control of a Kaibel divided-wall column (KDWC) for separating benzene, toluene, o-xylene and 1, 3, 5-trimethylbenzene mixtures. Two control structures based on a simple single-loop (decentralized) PI controller are proposed: five-temperature control loops (CS1), improved control structure (CS2) with combining pressure-compensated scheme into CS1. The control performance of CS1 and CS2 are investigated in terms of the control of component purities under various disturbances in feed conditions, which indicates that CS1 weakly controls product purity of the lower-side stream. Due to pressure compensation, CS2 is superior to CS1 in terms of purity control at the lower-side stream product under larger disturbances in feed conditions. CS2 that is based on temperature measurements can be easily implemented during practical operation of a KDWC in industry. From an industrial operation perspective, the pressure-compensated temperature control structure (CS2) provides potential solutions for a four-product KDWC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Interface deformation is a common phenomenon in multi-layered systems that can significantly impact the velocity and temperature fields. In order to track the interface position in a two-layered system subjected to vertical temperature gradient and shear flow, techniques of linear stability analysis (LSA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were applied. The LSA results show that the interface can be deformed for low Reynolds numbers if the fluids in each layer have different viscosity or thermal conductivity or if the thermocapillary effect is significant. The interface can be stabilized by increasing the ratio between the density of each fluid. The limits where the interface deformation can be neglected are defined for several cases. Comparisons with CFD results reveal that the linear analysis is consistent near the convection onset; however, as the Rayleigh number is increased and the non-linear terms become more significant, strong interface deformation can occur and the linear approximation no longer predicts the system behavior.

AB Metal organic frameworks are frequently examined as potential solutions to complex gas phase separations problems. In many cases, the gas phase adsorption properties of these materials are quantified using single component gas adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments. In adsorption separations, however, it is common that the adsorbent participates in a multicomponent adsorption event. In the literature there is a general absence of multicomponent adsorption data with most data predicted via the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory or molecular simulations. Therefore, in this work, binary adsorption data of CO2 and water on UiO-66 were measured experimentally using a volumetric method at three different water loadings. Molecular simulations of isotherms were compared to the experimental measurements and the impact of two different MOF defect sites on the multicomponent CO2/H2O adsorption behavior was determined. The experimental data show a slight enhancement of CO2 loading when CO2 is co-adsorbed with water, which is a result that was confirmed via molecular simulations. Also, the simulation results show that defect sites can have a greater influence on low-pressure CO2 adsorption in MOFs than the co-adsorption of water. Furthermore, the simulations provide a molecular-level understanding of the role of these defects on the single and binary adsorption behavior. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a framework for modelling twin-screw granulation processes with variable screw configurations using a high-dimensional stochastic population balance method is presented. A modular compartmental approach is presented and a method for estimating residence times for model compartments based on screw element geometry is introduced. The model includes particle mechanisms for nucleation, primary particle layering, coalescence, breakage, and consolidation. A new twin-screw breakage model is introduced, which takes into account the differing breakage dynamics between two types of screw element. Additionally, a new sub-model for the layering of primary particles onto larger agglomerates is presented. The resulting model is used to simulate a twin-screw system with a number of different screw configurations and the predictive power of the model is assessed through comparison with an existing experimental data set in the literature. For most of the screw configurations simulated, the model predicts the product particle size distribution at large particle sizes with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, the model has a tendency to over-predict the amount of fines in the final product. Nevertheless, the model qualitatively captures the reduction in fines associated with an increase in the number of kneading elements, as observed experimentally. Based on model results, a number of key areas for future model development are identified and discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cell disintegration is, in general, the first step in the biorefinery of algae, since it allows the release of biomolecules of interest from the cells into the bulk medium. For high-value commercial applications, the disintegration process must be selective, energy efficient and mild. Developing a process with such features would demand extensive experimental effort. In the present study, we attempt to provide a tool for developing an efficient disintegration process via bead milling, by proposing a modelling strategy that allows the prediction of the kinetics of cell disintegration while having as input not only process parameters but also strain-specific parameters like cell size and cell-wall strength. The model was validated for two different algal strains (Tetraselmis suecica and Chlorella vulgaris), at various values of bead size (0.3-1 mm) and bead fillings (2.5-75%) and at two different scales of 80 and 500 mL. Since the kinetics of disintegration is proportional to the kinetics of release of biomolecules, the model can be further used for scale-up studies and to establish a window of operation to selectively target cells or metabolites of interest. Furthermore, the energy consumption in the mill was evaluated and it was found that operating at high bead fillings (>65%) is crucial to ensure an energy efficient process. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Re-oxidation inclusion formation being a major concern in open air induction melting and casting facilities has acquired significant attention worldwide. Mathematical modeling has been attempted to understand the contributions from the two major sources of oxygen pickup viz. diffusion of oxygen through gaseous boundary layer and air entrainment in the past. In this work, an integrated approach has been developed to estimate the total oxygen pickup content from the aforementioned sources. The developed model consists of a fairly comprehensive and plausible formulation by incorporating refinements like time dependent velocity modification and application of modified Ranz-Marshall correlation which has not yet been addressed. The consolidated model predictions are in good agreement with the data obtained from literature. For further validation, a customized experimental setup was designed and oxygen pickup studies were performed upon it. The model predictions of oxygen and nitrogen pick up pertaining to the designed experiments have been found to be in concurrence with the measured total oxygen and nitrogen contents respectively.

AB In process industries, separation techniques need to be employed to match product quality and purity specifications. Most vapour-liquid based separation techniques involving the separation of close-boiling or azeotropic as well as gaseous mixtures are energy intensive. Downstream separations from bioreactors are, on the other hand, difficult because of relatively small amounts of products in large amounts of reactants and carriers such as water. With growing energy and environmental challenges, novel, sustainable and innovative separation techniques are receiving increasing attention. Because of their non-volatility and other tuneable properties, ionic liquids (ILs) based separation techniques are promising alternatives. In this work, a systematic method that combines group contribution (GC)-based property prediction and IL-based separation process design is presented. That is, the optimal IL molecular structure and the corresponding optimal flow sheet configuration for a specific IL-based separation process are simultaneously identified. Case studies involving the separation of azeotropic mixtures such as ethanol-water and acetone-methanol are presented to highlight the application of the method for synthesis-design of the IL-based separation technology.

AB In adsorption based separation techniques or in environmental applications where adsorption on a porous matrix is involved, the broadening of migrating bands of solutes varies with the characteristics of the adsorption isotherms and is generally overwhelming at solute concentrations deep in the non-linear region. We introduce here a novel concept to minimize concentration overloading dispersion: We show theoretically that a spatial alternation of Langmuir (L) and Anti-Langmuir (AL) zones along the displacement direction induces an accordion effect, i.e. an alternation of sharpening and dilution of the solute zones, reducing in the end the final broadening of the peak. We quantify in the parameter space of the problem the reduction in concentration overloading related band widening of the L-AL system compared to the pure L or AL cases. A numerical analysis of the solute transport reveals a dependence of solute spreading on the ratio of sample to stationary phase zone widths and on the intensity of the adsorption parameter. The initial position of the sample solvent in its surrounding liquid i.e. whether the displacement starts in a L or AL zone is also shown to have an influence on the dispersive behavior. An analysis is performed to highlight the optimal alternance geometry to minimize solute spreading. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bubble columns are widely equipped with vertical internals for heat removal in slurry/bubble column reactors or providing the light source in photobioreactors. Understanding the effect of internals on the hydrodynamics of a bubble column reactor is crucial for the reactor design and scale-up. The gas dispersion and liquid mixing are two important parameters in design of bubble columns. In this study, the Eulerian-Eulerian simulation coupled with the population balance model was developed for the bubble column with dense vertical internals. The impulse tracer injection was applied to study the gas dispersion. The effect of the gas flow fluctuations, the time span of tracer injection, and the presence of internals was assessed at different superficial gas velocities. The results showed that the presence of internals has a notable effect on gas behavior. A stronger gas velocity gradient with less turbulence and dispersion were observed in the presence of internals. To study the liquid mixing, the tracer technique was applied, and the sensitivity of results to the tracer injection and detector points have been discussed. The presence of internals reduced the fluctuating liquid velocities, which led to a lower mixing performance in the bubble column. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The instantaneous local solid volume fraction in a two-phase solid-liquid fluidization system is measured using high-speed Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). The unique aspect of EIT is that it provides local volume fraction fluctuations even for opaque, concentrated mixtures. A two-meter tall and 10.16 cm diameter fluidized bed loop is used for the experiments. Mono-sized spherical Delrin particles (d(p) = 3.34 - mm, rho(s )= 1400 kg/m(3)) with relatively low Stokes number (approximate to 100) are tested as the solid phase. The root mean square (RMS) of the solid fraction fluctuations in the near-wall region was found to be 3-4 times higher than the RMS at the center of the bed. The maximum magnitude of the fluctuations occurred at the bulk solid fraction ((C) over bar) of 0.31. Increasing (C) over bar had a notable effect on both the magnitudes and extent of the rates of decay in the power spectra. The spectra suggest that void fraction waves arising naturally in the bed act as an external driving force coupled with the turbulent spectrum, which leads to a predominantly two-dimensional turbulence within the bed. Cross-sectional-averaged fluctuations for a wide range of (C) over bar were found to be in good agreement with previous studies. Since most of the previous experimental studies on solid fraction fluctuations have been limited to cross-sectional-averaged values, the local measurements reported here provide a better understanding of the nature of small-scale fluctuations.

AB While the spinodal decomposition of mixtures in unbounded systems has been largely investigated, little is known about phase separation constrained within a slab. In this study, spinodal decomposition of a very viscous regular binary mixture bounded within two walls cooled at different temperatures is simulated by using the diffuse interface model in 2D. Under a temperature gradient, phase separation starts from the cooler wall forming dendritic structures growing anisotropically with time. Two remarkably different dynamics are identified depending on whether heat propagates slower or faster than mass. For small thermal conductivity (i.e., small Lewis number), dendrites grow parallelly to the temperature gradient, keeping such an alignment until the steady-state. On the other hand, for large Lewis number, during the early stages phase separation proceeds within stripes oriented along iso-temperature lines, i.e., with dendrites aligned perpendicularly to the temperature gradient, which, however, gradually shift their orientation parallel to the temperature gradient as the steady-state is approached. Such a dynamic transition of dendrite orientation upon a temperature gradient when heat propagates faster than mass is found to hold also for non-equimolar mixtures and for different species thermal conductivities. These results shed light on the dynamics of phase separation in constrained systems and anisotropic conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cells adhere on these spheres, which are then set in suspension in stirred tank bioreactors. This work was more particularly focused on the determination of the critical impeller agitation rate N-js, allowing complete beads suspension. It is indeed generally assumed that this value is a good compromise between sufficient nutrients homogenization, mass transfer and minimization of hydromechanical stress encountered by the cells. However, no robust correlation predicting N-js in the case of microcarriers can be found in literature. To fill this lack, a set of various operating conditions was carried out, dealing with geometrical variables and two different microcarriers, and N-js were experimentally determined for 140 conditions. An empirical correlation was established and a dimensional analysis was performed, showing that the impact of the particle concentration on N-js was function of the impeller design. Moreover, two dimensionless numbers characterizing the number of particle and an Archimede number applied on the particle cloud were found to better describe the impact of particle diameter and density on N-js. Simultaneously, a strategy based on Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations was conducted in order to predict N-js and was validated with the N-js experimental values. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Selection of primary controlled variables (CVs) with due consideration of economic loss and ease of control is an important step for achieving optimal plant operation under design and off-design conditions. However, the computational expense of the combinatorial optimization step that is undertaken for CV selection renders the existing approaches unaffordable for fast selection of optimal CVs. Two approaches are proposed in this paper for improving the computational efficiency of the optimization step. Typically, the CV selection process is typically executed by considering the entire plant together. Opposed to that, the first approach proposed here seeks to decompose the process plant into multiple partitions based on the connectivity strength. Then the CV selection algorithm can be executed on each partition independently. The decomposition algorithm is biomimetic and has been developed, in analogy to neuroscience, mimicking how the information about the connectivity information is extracted using a dynamic casual model. This approach can significantly decrease the number of combinatorial optimization problems that needs to be solved and facilitates parallelization of the solution. In the second approach, a multiagent optimization framework is proposed that utilizes metaheuristic optimization strategies such as the efficient ant colony algorithm, simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm. These two approaches can be used by themselves or in combination. This framework enables cooperative search by a group of algorithmic agents facilitated through an information sharing protocol. These two approaches are applied to a toy problem and an acid gas removal unit as part of an integrated gasification combined cycle. The study shows how the computational time and economic and control performance of the optimal CV sets vary as the number of partitions are changed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Horizontal and upward low-inclination gas-water and gas-oil flows are investigated using an annulus pipe configuration in a high-pressure system (similar to 400 kPa). The annulus test section, or the so-called pipe-in-pipe configuration, consists of an outer pipe of 99 mm inside diameter and an inner pipe of 50 mm outside diameter. Two different vertical positions of the inner pipe with respect to outer pipe have been tested; namely concentric configuration where both pipes have the same centreline and fully eccentric where the inner pipe is placed at the bottom wall of outer pipe. The flow is studied using high-speed photography, differential pressure transducers, and broad-beam gamma densitometers to characterise the flow as function of the liquid phase properties, annulus eccentricity, and pipe inclination. Flow regime maps reveal that slug flow appears to be the most common flow feature across the conditions studied in this paper. Flow in the eccentric annulus shows a more consistent behaviour (i.e. well-defined flow structures axially and in time) than that observed in the concentric annulus. Gas-oil flows show more stable phase fraction behaviour across the cross-section compared to that observed in gas-water flows in which the interface shows significant activity promoting the formation of droplets and ligaments that break from the liquid film. This is especially the case with the concentric annulus configuration. The oil phase regardless of the geometrical configuration tends to fully wet the pipe (made of PVC) as the gas velocity increases, creating a continuous film along the pipe walls. Conversely, the thin film in gas-water flow is not continuous. Discontinuity in the thin film increases with an increase in effective pipe roughness. Given the same inlet flow conditions, the concentric annulus configuration causes larger pressure drop along the pipe than that obtained in the eccentric. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The model is based on the hydrodynamic behaviour of slug flow and closure relationships developed for full pipe flow, which are adapted to account for the annulus diameter ratio and eccentricity. This includes the improvement of the model for the prediction of the single-phase friction factor in annuli. Model predictions are compared with the experimental data presented in Ibarra et al.

AB To perform thermochemical cycles using non-volatile metal oxides to split water and produce hydrogen, a directly irradiated fluidized bed reactor is designed and fabricated for beam-down configuration. As the main aim of this investigation is to analyze the heat transfer and particulate flow of the reactor, chemically inert particles are used. A transient 3D heat and mass transfer model is formulated by the combined approach of discrete element method and computational fluid dynamics. The radiative transfer is solved using the discrete ordinate radiation model. Experimental validation is accomplished by the measured temperatures, obtained with the fluidized bed reactor prototype tested under 30 kW(th) high-flux solar simulator. The model is applied to analyze the granular flow characteristics and efficiency of the reactor for various superficial gas velocities and bed masses. The results indicate that higher gas flow rate increases the velocity and convection loss of the bed and decreases the bed temperature and efficiency of the reactor. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Gas-liquid-liquid (G/L/L) multiphase flow in microfluidic system has been a vital part of microfluidics, micro-chemical and micro-analysis in recent years. Microfluidics has emerged as a useful tool to prepare G/L/L that affords improved control over the micro-scale structure. With the aid of clever and efficient device designs, precise regulation of the size, shape and components can be realized. Existing results have shown that G/L/L multiphase micro-flow exhibits more complicated laws and unique characteristics in flow, transport and reactions compared with liquid-liquid or gas-liquid two-phase flow, allowing the optimal and more efficient control of the process. In this review, focused on the G/L/L multiphase flow in microfluidic systems, we recount the historical development of this system and approach, along with the state-of-the-art, including discussion of microfluidic devices (lithographically defined devices and capillary/needle-based devices) and microchannel type (cross-junction, flow-focusing, dual-coaxial, etc.) used to form and prepare G/L/L multiphase mixtures. Discussion is also extended to scaling laws and numerical simulations used to predict the size of microbubbles or droplets. In addition, flow and mass transfer characteristics, as well as applications and scale-up, are also discussed. Finally, the future trends in the development of G/L/L multiphase flow are addressed, emphasizing some directions worth detailed study and remaining challenges in the field. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sulfonation process usually exhibit high reaction rate and low yield and selectivity of product in common reactors for its insufficient micromixing. This work employed a rotating packed bed (RPB) to intensify the micromixing of the phenol sulfonation process to improve the yield and selectivity of p-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (p-HBSA). Experiments and kinetic study on the sulfonation of phenol by concentrated sulfuric acid were carried out in a stirred tank reactor (STR). The reaction rate constant k and activation energy E at certain temperature was tested. The values of pre-exponential factor and activation energy were obtained as follows: k(1) = 5.74 x 10(3), E-1 = 8.17 kJ/mol, k(-1) = 6.95 x 10(3), E-1 = 6.18 kJ/mol, k(2) = 1.43 x 10(10), E-2 = 69.35 kJ/mol, k(-2) = 0.05 x 10(3), E-2 = 14.17 kJ/mol. The effects of various operating conditions including reaction temperature (T), sulfuric acid/phenol molar ratio (eta), solvent/phenol molar ratio (zeta), concentrated sulfuric acid feeding rate (Q'), stirring speed (P), ageing time (tau), on the content of p-HBSA were investigated in an attempt to obtain the optimal operating conditions in the STR. The yield of p-HBSA is 89.85% at the optimal operating conditions. On the basis of the results in STR, further experiments were performed in a rotating packed bed (RPB) to improve the sulfonation reaction selectivity and p-HBSA yield. The effects of rotation speed (N), cycle time (t) and concentrated sulfuric acid feeding rate (Q) were investigated. Results show that the yield of p-HBSA can reach up to 96.52% in RPB at the optimal operating conditions of N = 2250 rpm, Q = 300 mL/min, T = 100 degrees C, eta = 1.1, tau = 25 min, zeta = 1.25 and t = 3 min. The yield of p-HBSA obtained in the RPB is 6.67% higher than that in the STR. The research exhibits that RPB can obviously improve the yield of p-HBSA. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of the nanoscale dimension on the carbonization of electrospun fibers is usually overlooked. In this study, we prove that it is a decisive factor in the outcome of the carbonization process. Six electrospun fibrous mats, each with a different average fiber diameter ranging from 80 nm to 781 nm were fabricated from a lignin/recycled-PET blend of mass ratio 1/1, and their weight loss and decomposition profile were monitored via thermogravimetry. The nano-size effect is evident for those electrospun mats with average diameter lower than 121 nm. These mats exhibit a significantly higher decomposition rate at the 180-260 degrees C temperature range, which leads to a considerable degree of fusion of the precursor nanofibers. Thus, the carbon structures formed from these mats do not retain the geometrical integrity of their precursor nanofibers. In contrast, no size-effects are manifested to the electrospun samples of average fiber diameter larger than 387 nm, as they decompose at a similar and lower rate between 180 and 260 degrees C and yield infusible carbon fibers with similar geometry as their corresponding precursor fibers. These results highlight the determinant role of the nano-dimension when carbon fibers are produced through the carbonization of precursor fibers at the sub-micron scale and point out its significance in processes controlled by heat and mass transfer phenomena, as in the case of carbonization.

AB Impregnation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) onto porous excipients offers several advantages to solid dosage pharmaceutical preparation over conventional formulation methods. Previous work has successfully introduced fluidized bed (FB) impregnation of APIs onto porous carriers as a robust manufacturing process with numerous benefits (easy to implement, excellent blend uniformity and dissolution kinetics, stabilization of amorphous APIs). This study aims to develop a simple, multi-scale modeling approach to FB impregnation. The model consists of three main parts: (1) an energy/mass balance on the FB and an evaporative flux calculation, (2) an impregnation model for a single particle and (3) a drying model for a single particle. The model allows the calculation of some important process parameters (e.g. product temperature, maximum liquid spray rate) for given drying conditions. These are important process parameters needed to achieve successful impregnation. The model accounts for convection, diffusion and crystallization within the particle. The main characteristic is the 2D modeling of the liquid and API distributions within the particle during impregnation and drying. Several cases are presented to illustrate the effect of some material properties (fast crystallization, slow diffusion, low porosity) on the final API profile. Simulation results regarding API profiles of impregnation are in a very good agreement with experimental measurements carried out in our previous work. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The baseline model for the CFD-simulation of turbulent bubbly flows in the Euler-Euler framework was proposed several years ago. It defines a fixed set of closures including all constants to avoid case by case tuning and to have a basis for sustainable model development. The present paper extends the baseline model by improving the modelling of bubble-induced turbulence. The closure terms in the transport equations of the k-omega SST model are revisited and replaced with the model recently proposed by Ma et al. (Ma et al., 2017. Physical Review Fluids 2, 034301) which is based on an analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy budget obtained from direct numerical simulation data. Detailed validation results for various flow configurations with a wide range of gas and liquid volumetric fluxes are presented. In case of vertical pipe flow significant improvements in the predicted gas volume fraction and velocity profiles are obtained, especially in high gas volume fraction cases where bubble-induced turbulence is dominant. Simulations of other configurations, such as uniform and non-uniform bubble columns, show that the model of Ma et al. (2017) results in an also for these cases overall improvement. Therefore, the baseline model is now updated to include the new model for bubble-induced turbulence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A comparison of the predicted and experimental values shows that the molar entropies and Gibbs free energies of N-2 can be excellently predicted in the temperature range of 100-6000 K. The present entropy and Gibbs free energy prediction models only require the experimental values of three molecular constants and are away from the utilization of a great number of experimental spectroscopy data.

AB Emulsions are deeply involved in almost all aspects of the petroleum industry, especially in enhanced oil recovery. Supramolecular chemistry proposes a facile and controllable method to construct target assemblies. In this report, we investigated the effects of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) on the emulsions stabilized by the mixed N-dodecyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bromide (L12) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The additional beta-CD exerted strong influences on the water/n-octane interfacial tension (IFT) between n-octane and the mixed L12/SDS aqueous solutions, which should be attributed to its selective host-guest recognition. Interestingly, the additional beta-CD in moderate concentrations could selectively remove the major surfactant molecules at the interface to adjust the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of the mixed adsorption layers, thereby causing the transformation of the emulsion type from O/W to W/O. The addition of excess beta-CD would generate the construction of n-octane/beta-CD complexes to enhance the hydrophilicity of the interfacial layers, which leads again to phase inversion. Emulsions and their types were characterized and confirmed by the measurements of their conductivities, average droplet radii and rheological properties. To verify the proposed mechanism for the multiple phase inversion, the effects of L12/SDS molar ratios and beta-CD concentrations were studied in depth in the control experiments.

AB Low-pressure carburizing involves hydrocarbon pyrolysis, which leads to a fast gas-phase formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which, such as benzo[a]pyrene, are carcinogenic. Workers can be exposed to these PAHs during maintenance and cleaning operations of carburizing furnaces. Experiments of acetylene pyrolysis were carried out in conditions close to low-pressure gas carburizing processes, at 1173 K and 8 kPa, in tubular reactors. At the outlet of the reaction zone, the reactant and the reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (TCD, FID and MS). Amongst other products, 16 PAHs classified as priority pollutants by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) were observed and quantified. The study of the influence of residence time and of inlet reactant concentration shows that amounts of PAHs increase with residence time at low acetylene concentration but slightly decrease with pure acetylene due to the conversion of PAHs into soot. Results were compared to simulation results obtained with a detailed kinetic model of light hydrocarbon pyrolysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study reports an experimental investigation on the dynamics of impacting hydrocarbon fuel drops on a heated stainless steel surface in the film evaporation regime. The analysis is focused on the description of maximum spreading diameter of the impacting fuel drops on the heated surface kept at different temperatures below the boiling point of the fuel. By considering four different fuels of varying physical properties and fuel drops with impact velocity in the range 0.6 - 3.5 m/sec, the study explores a wide range of Weber number (30 - 902), Reynolds number (372 - 13457) and Ohnesorge number (0.0022 - 0.0151). The drop morphology and spreading dynamics on the heated surface are quantified by studying high speed videos of drop impact captured during experiments. Data analysis suggests that, in addition to Weber number and surface temperature, dynamic viscosity of the fuel also plays a role in determining the quantified trends of maximum spreading diameter. Existing theoretical models for the prediction of maximum diameter on unheated flat surfaces can be extended for drop impact on heated surfaces in the film evaporation regime by using surface temperature dependent fuel viscosity. With the support of the present experimental data, an empirical model involving an explicit surface temperature term is proposed for the prediction of maximum diameter on a heated surface in the film evaporation regime.

AB Flow characteristics in channels are critical in chemical engineering. Slip velocity has a great influence on the microchannel flows. The lattice Boltzmann simulations of some typical channel flows are conducted with an improved slip boundary condition. Through theoretical analysis, the defects of the existing slip boundary conditions are clarified. To solve these problems, the slip boundary condition of Kuo et al. is ameliorated by considering the tangential momentum change generated by the external force. Besides, the Navier's slip model is adopted to specify the improved slip boundary condition. With this improved scheme, we study five cases, namely the Couette flow, the force driven Poiseuille flow, the time-dependent force driven Womersley flow, the porous plate flow and the channel flow with a surface-mounted block. Our method is accurate and reliable enough even with a coarse grid. The mass leakage at the wall is avoided and the numerical error generated by the external force is eliminated.

AB Many models for predicting the breakup of liquid films spreading over solid substrates have been proposed over the years, each taking a different approach to modelling the minimum stable film height. There is not a lot of reliable experimental data in the literature for validating these models, however, as previous measurement campaigns have generally relied on the relatively weak gravitational force as a wetting driver, making the results sensitive to minor flow disturbances and flaws in the substrate.
   The present work considers experimentally the breakup of films spreading radially over rapidly rotating substrates, where the much stronger centrifugal force takes the place of gravity. An empirical correlation has been derived from the presently generated data and compared with analytical predictions. The predictions of the analytical wetting models, appropriately modified, were additionally validated against the observed radial breakup locations.
   The models which considered an equilibrium of surface tension and inertia were found to give the best overall agreement with the data. However, it was also shown that the retarding effect of viscous shear needs to be taken into account in the modelling and that a blended approach incorporating both inertial and viscous length scales is necessary in order to obtain a generally valid model.

AB Microfluidic chemotaxis analysis requires stable and reproducible formation of chemical gradient with low batch-to-batch variation. Dimensional uniformity of a junction channel plays a key role in diffusion-based gradient generation. Conventional methods for the analysis of bacterial chemotaxis are limited in stability and reproducibility of the chemical gradient. Here, we report a microfabrication method employing plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition for silicon oxide deposition and consecutive reactive ion etching processes to reduce the experimental errors of chemotaxis analysis occurring from dimensional inaccuracy of the junction channel. This approach produces precise dimensional junction channels with below 1% variation. Thus, we confirm the reproducibility of chemotaxis analysis and obtain the chemotaxis index of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 with bacterial chemoeffectors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Surfactant molecules can self-assemble into micellar networks and be used as efficient additives in turbulent drag reduction in aqueous solutions. The mechanism of turbulent drag reduction by these percolating structures is still unclear. In particular, the "viscoelasticity theory" postulates that the micellar network structures are capable of absorbing and releasing stress from turbulent kinetic energy which results in the decrease of the energy dissipation. Here, we focus on the single wormlike surfactant micelle which consists of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) and counter ion salts to study the energy variation during its deformation processes using MARTINI force field coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations. The Muller-Plathe method was used to generate the small and large deformation stretching statuses of the wormlike micelle through adjusting the momenta exchange frequency. The simulation results show that the micelle can transfer its potential energy to water during its relaxation stage after being stretched. It is also found that the flow field of water is significantly influenced by the recoil of micelle and a vortex is observed in the area semi-enclosed by the bending micelle. Overall, the present study supports the hypothesis of "viscoelasticity theory" and provides further insight into the mechanism of turbulent drag reduction by surfactant additives.

AB In order to overcome the apparent limitations of large-scale microwave processing, a microwave heating system with a screw propeller was utilized for biodiesel synthesis. To elucidate the heating dynamics and reaction process in the reactor, a comprehensive physics-based model was developed. A step-by-step algorithm based on implicit function, level set methods, and Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Formulation (ALE) machinery was proposed to compute the microwave heating process with chemical reaction and stirring. Material properties applied in the simulation were expressed as bivariate functions of the reaction solution's component and temperature. The temperature and reactant concentration of the microwave reactor outlet were measured and compared to simulation results to validate the simulation model. By using the proposed model, the heating process with different rotating speeds, material composition (Teflon and metal), pitch, and blade widths of the screw propeller and inlet velocities were also calculated to determine their effect on the temperature distribution of the reactor.

AB The hydrodynamic characteristics of tapered bubbling/turbulent fluidized beds with/without gas distributor are simulated based on the structure-based drag model. Besides the only parameter of gas voidage (epsilon(g)) contained in the original drag model, the heterogeneous drag index (H-d) for the tapered fluidized bed (TFB) also includes the parameter of gas velocity (u(g)) for the axial velocity gradient along bed height. Both the simulations of tapered bubbling and turbulent fluidized beds achieve more accurate predictions than the traditional drag models. There exist dilute center and dense annular regions with solids cycle flow structure in the TFB. The simulation also gives reasonable prediction for TFB without gas distributor, the variation of gas voidage profile reveals gas converging toward bed center with axial location rising.

AB A two-dimensional mesoscopic gas-solid two-phase flow model has been developed to investigate the flow and soot loading in the micro-channel of diesel particulate filters. Soot particle size examined is in the range of 10 nm-1 mu m. The flow is solved by an incompressible lattice Boltzmann model and the transport of solid particles is described by the cell automation probabilistic model. The lattice Boltzmann-cell automation probabilistic model (LB-CA model) is validated with the results of previous studies. The effects of different upstream velocities on the flow field in channels are investigated. The distribution and deposition of soot particles with different sizes in clean channels are simulated based on the LB-CA method and the LB-Lagrangian method respectively. The effects of deposited soot particles on flow field are evaluated in real soot particle capture process. The results show that the distributions of velocity field and pressure field in the channel are significantly affected by the upstream velocity. Compared with the effect of the particle size, the upstream velocity is more influential on the particle deposition distributions. The profiles of deposition distribution from the LB-CA method are in close agreement with those from the LB-Lagrangian method. The deposition distributions of particles with different diameters at the top of the porous wall are similar to the distributions of wall velocity along the channel length. Generally, the deposited soot particles increase the axial pressure and decrease the axial velocity in the inlet channel. The evolution trend of the areas where wall velocity undergoes changes is consistent with that of the solid nodes made of the captured soot particles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The role of solvent molecules in electrolytes for supercapacitors, representing a fertile ground for improving the capacitive performance of supercapacitors, is complicated and has not been well understood. Here, a combined method is applied to study the solvent effects on capacitive performance. To identify the relative importance of each solvent variable to the capacitance, five machine learning (ML) models were tested for a set of collected experimental data, including support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptions (MLP), M5 model tree (M5P), M5 rule (M5R) and linear regression (LR). The performances of these ML models are ranked as follows: M5P > M5R > MLP > SVR > LR. Moreover, the classical density functional theory (CDFT) is introduced to yield more microscopic insights into the conclusion derived from ML models. This method, by combining machine learning, experimental and molecular modeling, could potentially be useful for predicting and enhancing the performance of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs).

AB Thin porous layers, that have large aspect ratios, are seen in many applications such as hydrogen fuel cells and hygiene products, in which air-water immiscible flow is of great interest. Direct numerical simulations based on Navier-Stokes equation are computationally expensive, and even prohibitive for low capillary number flow such as water flooding in low-temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Alternatively, the pore-network modeling needs much less computational resources, while still retaining essentials of the pore-structure information. In this work, a dynamic pore-network model of air-water flow with phase change has been developed. We focus on drainage processes through thin porous layers, in which liquid water is the nonwetting phase. Three test cases are conducted, namely, air-water flow through a thin porous layer, air-water flow through a bilayer of fine and coarse thin porous layers, and water flooding in the gas diffusion layer of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell with phase change between water and its vapor. Using these test cases, we aim to demonstrate the application of dynamic pore-network modeling in thin porous media studies. In particular, we discuss the challenge of modeling thin porous media at the average scale, and highlight the role of phase change in removing liquid water from the cathode gas diffusion layer.

AB A coupled model of computational fluid dynamics and population balance model (CFD-PBM) scheme was developed to simulate bubble size distribution in gas-solid bubbling fluidized beds. The bubbling gas fluidized bed was divided into a discrete bubble phase and a dense emulsion including a pseudo solids continua modeled by the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF). A modified bubble coalescence and breakup model was proposed and implemented in the population balance model. A pseudo bubble-emulsion drag force model was derived based on the bubble size distribution and used for simulating the gas-solid momentum exchanges between gas bubbles and the solids belong to the emulsion phase. By taking into account the effects of bubble coalescence and breakup, the coupled CFD-PBM model was capable of predicting the hydrodynamic behavior of a bubbling gas-solid fluidized bed. A benchmark simulation showed good agreements between the computation results and the literature experimental data. Particularly, the predicted time-averaged bubble local hold-up maps, bubble size distributions and their evolution agreed well with the measurement data. Grid convergence simulation results demonstrated that the present model is able to predict the major hydrodynamic behavior of a 2D bubbling fluidized bed using coarse computational grids, which makes the present model a promising tool for applications in large-scale fluidized bed reactors.

AB We present a novel multiphase flow metering technique for simultaneous measurement of oil and water volumetric flowrates. An Earth's field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection coil is applied to measure free induction decay (FID) signals of two-phase oil/water flows. A dual polarisation technique is introduced utilising an upstream permanent magnet as well as an electromagnetic prepolarising coil. FID signals with variable pre-polarising conditions are acquired and fit with a model for the NMR fluid signal using a 2D Tikhonov regularisation algorithm, allowing determination of a joint 2D velocity-T-1 probability distribution. Appropriate analysis of the measured velocity-T-1 distributions allows calculation of individual phase flowrates. The performance of the NMR flow measurement technique is examined for oil/water flows which are visually observed to be in three different flow regimes: stratified flow with mixing, dispersion of oil-in-water and water, and full oil-in-water emulsions. Two-phase flow characteristic features such as velocity slip are examined for each flow regime. Finally the accuracy of the measurement system in each flow regime is validated against in-line rotameter measurements. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A population balance model is used to investigate the effect of mesoporous silica particles on calcium sulphate crystallisation in a stirred batch crystalliser. The model accounts for nucleation, growth, agglomeration, breakage, and particle-assisted nucleation, and the model equations are solved numerically using the method of classes over a logarithmic, non-uniform mesh. The crystallisation process is characterized experimentally using electrical conductivity to track the ion concentration and laser diffraction to measure the steady-state crystal size distribution obtained at the end of the experiments. The experiments are carried out over a range of temperatures, initial supersaturations, particle pore diameters, and particle loadings. The model is first fitted to experimental data obtained in the absence of particles to determine kinetic parameters of the nucleation, growth, agglomeration, and breakage for pure calcium sulphate crystallisation. Varying pore diameter did not influence the catalytic effect of the particles, however, particle loading was found to significantly decrease the nucleation induction time. The model was extended to account for the presence of particles by fitting two additional mechanisms. The first proposed a particle-assisted nucleation where nuclei are produced via heterogeneous crystallisation, then detach by particle-particle collision that is second-order with respect to particle loading. The second proposed that the crystal breakage frequency increases linearly with particle loading. Good agreement with the experimental data is demonstrated over the range of conditions examined.

ID DYNAMIC FRAGMENTATION; CONSTITUTIVE MODEL; DEFORMATION; SYSTEMS;

AB When particle rings/shells are subjected to divergent explosive loadings, a dual overlapping particle jetting structure emerges during the shock interaction timescale which consists of a large number of minor jets initiated from the external interface at very early instants and a much reduced number of major jets formed from the internal interface at delayed times but overtaking the minor jets in later times. In the present work, the formation of the hierarchical particle jetting pattern is investigated numerically by discrete element method (DEM) coupled with finite element method (FEM), which execute the mechanical calculations of particles and the explosive/detonation gases, respectively. The numerical results find that the external jetting arises from the spallation of an outer layer pulled away by inward propagating rarefaction waves. Meanwhile an inner compact band re-compressed by a secondary shock remains densely packed while expanding outward. The fragmentation of the inner compact particle band, preceding the internal particle jetting, is caused by the profuse spiral shear failures expanding from the inner radius to the outer radius. The resultant jetting structure depends on the shear-band spacing and the grouping of the clockwise and counterclockwise shear bands as well. The former is a function of the bulk characteristics of the inner compact band, especially the resistance to the shear flows. The latter markedly varies with the microstructure of particle packing, especially the structural order. In the highly ordered extreme, the particle ring with global crystalline structure exhibits six groups of shear bands, probably giving rise to around six fragments. By contrast, the grouping of shear bands in the amorphous packing is far from definite, suggesting an increased number of much smaller fragments to be generated. The dual jetting structure would degenerate into a single jetting pattern if the inner compact band manages to entrain all the spall particles before the shear failure occurs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Determining random packing density and equivalent packing size of

AB We propose a new approach to determining the random packing densities of superballs via binary mixtures with spheres. The main idea of the approach is to suppress order formations in non-spherical particle packings via the polydispersity of particle shapes, which avoids using order metrics. The packing density of superballs in a mixture can be segregated using a linear fitting method with the concept of equivalent packing size (or size ratio with unit spheres) which represents the effective size (or volume) of a non-spherical particle in a binary mixture with spheres. We systemically study the packing properties of binary mixtures consisting of spheres and superballs and obtain the equivalent packing sizes of superballs. Our results show that the equivalent packing size ratio always corresponds to the minimal packing density or specific volume (reciprocal of packing densities) variation, and is independent of the solid volume fraction. The specific volumes of mixtures with the equivalent packing size ratio are always the upper bound for all the solid volume fractions. The linear relationship between the specific volume and solid volume fraction is only observed in the mixtures with superballs of small surface shape parameters (shapes close to a sphere), which results from the highly disordered nature in the mixtures. Moreover, the ideal random packing densities of mono-sized superballs obtained via the linear fitting method are surprisingly close to those of the MDRPs (maximally dense random packings), further verifying that the MDRPs of non-spherical particles correspond to the ideal random packings whose degrees of order are at the same level with that of the random close packing of spheres. Our work leads to a better understanding towards the random and binary packings and sheds new light on the essence of the MDRP. Our work also guides the optimal particle size distributions of powders in chemical engineering process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A domain decomposition-based lattice Boltzmann-cell automation probabilistic model (DDLB-CA model) has been developed to investigate soot particle filtration process in wall-flow diesel particulate filters. In order to obtain useful information for optimization of the porous structure, non-virtual porous walls are considered. Nine different porous walls are generated by a self-developed reconstruction scheme based on the pore size distribution (PSD) and porosity. The DDLB-CA model is validated with the results of previous studies. A clear pressure gradient and a spatial inhomogeneous velocity distribution can be seen for each porous wall. For the porous wall with the smallest mean pore size and the largest porosity, a lower initial pressure gradient and a better initial homogeneous velocity distribution can be achieved. Particles tend to deposit at the front of the porous wall with a PSD of a smaller mean pore size. Besides, particles also have an obvious tendency of depositing on the surface of narrow porous channels. Particle capture probability is obviously affected by the PSD. Therefore, adjustment of the PSD is recommended for optimization of the particle distribution and filtration efficiency. The solid nodes composed of deposited soot particles appear on the surface of narrow porous channels first and then form dendritic structures. Finally, the dendrite structures construct a bridge and block the narrow porous channel. The distributions of solid nodes are affected obviously by the structure of porous media. The locations of solid nodes affect the distribution of pressure and the uniformity of velocity distribution. The subsequent particles are more inclined to deposit at the front of the porous wall and the particle deposition efficiency eta increases after the formation of solid nodes. For the porous wall with a PSD of a smaller mean pore size, the solid nodes in front of porous walls (x/L-w < 0) are more concentrated, which means the cake layer will form more easily.

AB Solvents have been widely used in chemical manufacturing processes. When involved in liquid homogeneous-phase kinetic reactions, they can have significant impacts on the reaction product yield. In this paper, an optimization-based framework is developed for reaction solvent design. The framework first identifies a reaction kinetic model using a hybrid method consisting of three steps. In step one, a rigorous thermodynamic derivation based on CTST (Conventional Transition State Theory) is performed to formulate a primary reaction kinetic model. In step two, a knowledge-based method is used to select additional solvent properties as supplementary descriptors to account for quantitative correction to the model and thereby improving the prediction accuracy. In step three, model identification is performed to obtain the best regressed reaction kinetic model. This hybrid modelling method is tested through two case studies, namely Diels-Alder and Menschutkin reactions, and an impressive consistency of the results is observed when the infinite dilution activity coefficients (calculated by COSMO-SAC model), hydrogen-bond donor, hydrogen-bond acceptor and solvent surface tension are selected as descriptors in the final reaction kinetic model. The GC-COSMO and GC (Group Contribution) methods are combined for the prediction of these descriptors. Finally, the Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) technique is integrated with the derived kinetic model for reaction solvent design by formulating and solving a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model. A decomposition-based solution algorithm is employed to manage the complexity involved with the nonlinear COSMO-SAC equations. Promising reaction solvents are identified and compared with those reported by others, indicating wide applicability and high accuracy of the developed optimization-based framework.

AB We report experiments on bubble formation from needles with and without liquid co-flow, carried out with needles in the range of 0.79 < d(n) < 2.06 mm, for gas flow rates up to 4.5 cm(3)/s per needle, and with liquid co-flow velocities up to 0.4 m/s. Bubble sizes and frequencies were obtained by means measuring an acoustic signal in the pressurized chamber upstream, which is validated by high-speed imaging analysis. Bubble contours, bubble growth curves and time return plots were obtained to analyse the bubble formation process. Different bubbling regimes are distinguished and a novel dimensionless pressure ratio is proposed to forecast the emergence of weeping and the transition from constant flow rate bubbling to constant chamber pressure bubbling. A single correlation for the non-dimensional bubble size with and without liquid co-flow was developed and validated with the experimental data obtained in the present study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Probing the effects of hydrodemetallization (HDM) catalyst pore structures is of great importance. In this work, the pore structures of hierarchically structured HDM catalyst pellets are optimized based on a Random Spheres Model at the reactor scale. Understanding of the metal deposition behaviors and the concentration profiles along the reactor indicates strong macropore-dependent catalyst pellet utilization and mesopore-dependent bed utilization, respectively. Subsequently, relationships of the effective diffusivity with the macropore structure and the concentration gradient along the reactor with the mesopore structure are proposed, and the effects of the macro-/mesopore diameters and porosity are studied to maximize the exit conversion and catalyst lifetime. Our optimized results not only are superior to previously optimized results, but also provide rational interpretations for previous experimental observations. The insights revealed here could shed new light on the rational pore engineering of the hierarchical structured HDM catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A dynamic model was developed for a single reactor tube, in which methanol oxidation to formaldehyde over an iron molybdate/molybdenum oxide catalyst takes place simultaneously with transport of MoO3 from the catalyst through the reactor. A previously developed dynamic 1D mathematical model for a single ring-shaped cylindrical catalyst pellet, in which volatilization of MoO3 takes place, was implemented in the reactor model. Known axial profiles in a pilot scale reactor with respect to MeOH and H2O concentration and temperature were used as input to the model. MeOH forms volatile Mo-species with solid MoO3 in the catalyst pellets, which diffuses to the bulk gas phase and is transported through the reactor, leading to MoO3 depleted pellets. Volatilization of MoO3 from the pellets occur at the inlet of the reactor. As MeOH is oxidized down the reactor, the volatile Mo-species decomposes via the reverse reaction that formed them. Deposition of MoO3 downstream in the reactor decreases the void space between the catalyst pellets leading to increased pressure drop. The hydraulic diameter of the catalyst pellets and the porosity of the deposited MoO3 were fitted to experimental data obtained in a pilot plant unit containing a single reactor tube. Furthermore, the model was used to simulate a tube under industrial conditions for up to two years (feed composition 8.4% MeOH, 4% H2O, 10% O-2 in N-2, bed length = 100 cm and a temperature of 190-346 degrees C). Finally, two cases where catalyst pellets with no excess MoO3 or shaped as filled cylinders are used in the initial 21 cm of the catalyst bed were simulated. The simulations show that this significantly decreases the rate at which the pressure drop increases. This model is a first step towards a useful tool to predict MoO3 transport, pressure drop increase and estimation of process life time at varying reaction conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID CHEMICAL-PRODUCT; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; DETERGENT; QUALITY
AB A new product design framework is presented with the simultaneous consideration of make-or-buy analysis and supplier selection. Consumer preferences are first identified. Product ingredients are classified into different types based on their functionalities. For each ingredient type, potential ingredient candidates are generated from material databases or predictions using computer-aided tools. Heuristics and models (e.g., statistical, empirical, and mechanistic) are used to screen the ingredients and to design a process to manufacture a product with the desired product quality. Then, product price and market demand are determined by using a pricing model. After this, make-or-buy decisions are made through heuristics and suppliers are selected to maximize the profit. Two case studies consisting of light duty liquid detergent and controlled release granular herbicide are provided to illustrate the framework. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The molecular dynamic simulation of oil detachment from the calcium carbonate solid surface employing nanoparticles, an ionic surfactant and low salinity brine at petroleum reservoir operating conditions is investigated in this work. All molecular, atomic and ionic force fields and fluids-rock surface interactions are rigorously simulated in the present work. The simulation results indicate that both nanoparticle sand surfactant are adsorbed at the interface between oil and aqueous brine solution such that a reduction of interfacial tension and an increase in total surface pressure lead to the oil detachment. Synergetic effect of nanoparticle, surfactant and ionic species on the alteration of rock surface wettability from oil-wet to water condition is also demonstrated by the proposed approach. The proposed molecular simulation is quite useful for assessment of the performance of complex injecting fluids regarding the oil detachment from calcium carbonate surface at reservoir operating conditions.

AB Discrete element method (DEM) simulations of shear flows of binary mixtures of large non-spherical glued-sphere particles and small spheres are conducted in order to investigate the effect of particle shape and solid volume fraction ratio on the behavior of binary granular flows. The shear stresses first decrease and then increase with total solid volume fraction. The shear stresses increase with the increasing solid volume fraction ratio of large particles. The orientation distributions of large particles show that, in dense regions, the binary system with a higher solid fraction ratio of small spheres exhibits a more uniform alignment in the shear flow direction for large particles. By incorporating the effective particle projected area in the plane perpendicular to the flow plane, the conventional kinetic theory for binary spherical systems is found capable of predicting the stresses for binary systems of non-spherical particles. Stresses for binary systems with various solid volume fraction ratios collapse into a single line by further incorporating the root-mean-cubed diameter, but this scaling is not adequate for dense flows. Comparing the shear stresses for different large particle shapes shows that shear stresses can be affected by the particle shape and particle aspect ratio, but the differences between different particle shapes and aspect ratios are minimized by increasing the solid volume fraction ratio of small spheres.

AB Transition from bubbly to slug flow is a well-known phenomenon. In the channel with a swirler, a transition to slug flow at a lower gas superficial velocity than in the same channel without the swirler was observed in this work. The transition phenomenon from bubble flow to slug flow under the effect of swirl in a circular pipe was observed and investigated. Compared to the flow pattern (maintaining the bubble flow along a streamwise direction) in a non-swirling flow, we observe that bubble flow is transformed to a gas column downstream of the swirler, then broken up, and finally separated into gas slugs in the streamwise direction. The dynamic condition for the occurrence of a liquid bridge is proposed, then combined with a swirl decay model of a gas-liquid two-phase swirling flow; thus, the axial position for the transition from a gas column to a slug flow along the streamwise direction can be predicted. Whether slug flow always remains along the streamwise direction is closely related to its size. Under the effect of swirl, the void fraction is decreased and the pressure drop is increased compared with that in a non-swirling flow, and gradually approximates the values of a non-swirling flow along the streamwise direction.

AB Shifting from aqueous to water lean solvents has been evaluated as a mean for increasing the mass transfer rates in regular chemical solvents with amines. An array of amines (monoethanolamine, 2-methylpiperazine and N-methyl diethanolamine) and diluents (sulfolane, ethylene glycol, 1-methylimidazole, dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) has been analyzed. Addition of organic diluents seem to generally induce both a shift in chemical equilibrium and an increase in mass transfer rates for a fixed CO2 partial pressure, though not necessarily for a fixed CO2 loading. However, these relative advantages in terms of mass transfer rates decrease the more loaded the water lean solvent is. The equilibrium shift caused by organic diluents has been evaluated in terms of de-stabilization of the species in the solvent, which for monoethanolamine-based solvents can be easily related to a decrease in dielectric permittivity. However, this analysis indicates that such treatment is insufficient for other types of water-lean solvents, suggesting that different kinds of intermolecular interactions should also be considered in future studies.

AB Two-phase liquid-gas Taylor flow triggered by blocking-squeezing mechanism was studied with different junction angle theta microchannels, i.e. 20 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees and 160 degrees, at various liquid (ethanol) and gas (He) flow rates. We experimentally investigated the effects of flow rates and theta on the gas bubble V-B and liquid slug V-S volumes. A theoretical model was formulated for the quantitative predictions of bubble and slug sizes for different theta and flow rates. Good agreements were obtained between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. The unit cell volume V-U (V-B + V-S) decreased pronouncedly for the 20 degrees channel with decreasing liquid or increasing gas flow rate, due to the slight increase in V-B and large decrease in V-S. In comparison, for the 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees and 160 degrees channels with increasing liquid or decreasing gas flow rate, V-U were less sensitive to fluid flow rate changes, due to the approximate cancellation between V-B decrease and V-S increase. For the 20 degrees and 45 degrees channels, it produced larger V-U, due to larger V-B and V-S, when compared to the 90 degrees channel. This is caused by the larger gas bubble throat width D-N at the junction when theta < 90 degrees. As for the 135 degrees and 160 degrees channels (theta > 90 degrees), D-N is approximately equal to the gas channel width, with V-B, V-S and V-U approximately the same as the 90 degrees channel. With theta >= 90 degrees (i.e. 90 degrees, 135 degrees and 160 degrees channels), as evident from the smaller V-U, higher gas bubble density can be obtained when compared to theta < 90 degrees (i.e. 20 degrees and 45 degrees channels). Hitherto, this observation has not been realized, and the mechanics is first investigated here with the employment of extreme theta (i.e. 20 degrees and 160 degrees). A thorough understanding of the underlying mechanics affecting Taylor flow can facilitate its exploitation for controlled gas bubble and liquid slug generation. Our theoretical model facilitates the tuning of the channel designs and fluid flow rates to achieve the desired gas bubble and liquid slug sizes for specific applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Liquefied natural gas (LNG), a clean fuel type mainly containing methane, has been becoming more popular amongst the other fuels for the power generation systems. Although there are a lot of thermodynamic and thermoeconomic assessments about the LNG fired power generation systems, the environmental and sustainability aspects have still lack investigation, especially on the optimization step. To minimize this gap, a multiobjective optimization study is performed for the LNG fired microcogeneration system. The current study considers various objective functions from thermodynamic, environmental, thermoeconomic, and sustainability aspects. A newly developed sustainability index is used as one of the objective functions in the study. The approach is defined as the complex multiobjective optimization procedure that constitutes different multiobjective optimization groups to better understand and evaluate the different objective functions together. The controllable air temperature and relative humidity are selected as the external decision variables. The best trade-off regions are identified between 300.00 K and 313.15 K at the relative humidity of 90% while they are found between 310.15 K and 313.15 K at the relative humidity of 50%. The high relative humidity and ambient air temperature present the best climatic conditions for the optimal operation of the small-scale system during the indoor operations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Liquid dispersion in chemical processes is significant for increasing mass or heat transfer. A particle-based method, the moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method, was employed in this study to simulate the process of liquid dispersion by mesh packing. The computational framework includes a designed inlet flow model, hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface boundary conditions, and a surface tension model. This study mainly focuses on the effect of hydrophobic/hydrophilic mesh packing on liquid dispersion performance. The mechanism of liquid dispersion is systematically investigated in basic situations as a liquid passing through a single wire, an orthogonal wire and a single aperture. The results indicate that hydrophobic and hydrophilic mesh packing have different effects on the formation of the free surface, which is the key to the mechanism of the liquid dispersion process. Hydrophobic mesh packing can disperse a liquid into several fine columns with detected droplets, which further develop into fine droplets, whereas hydrophilic mesh packing will guide a liquid to converge into a column at the bottom of the mesh packing. In addition, the surface area density and dispersion range of a liquid are quantitatively analyzed to illustrate liquid dispersion performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The coating of tablets to prevent product degradation or control dissolution is a typical process in its production. Coating uniformity is critical for the quality of final product and batch acceptance. Therefore, the coating process needs to be optimized in order to achieve the desired uniformity and reduce manufacturing costs. Thus, understanding how process parameters such as spray properties, equipment geometry and tablet shape influence the coating process is critical for process optimization and approval by regulatory bodies. However this is a non-trivial task as obtaining information about the detailed processes in a tablet coater via experimental means is limited. Thus, computational modeling is the most feasible option to obtain information about the physical processes affecting the performance of tablet coaters. The most widely used computational method for such numerical modelling is the Discrete Element Method (DEM) where individual particles (tablets) are simulated. However, the computational cost of representing the typical shape of tablets is high for industrially relevant simulations. Thus tablet shape is typically approximated by simpler shapes such as spheres or multi spheres. Even with such simplifications, typical simulations take months to complete making it unfeasible for process optimization and design. In the last decade, the Graphical Processor Unit (GPU) has enabled large-scale simulations of tens of millions of spheres and millions of shaped particles using the XPS code. In this paper, we present an algorithm for modeling accurate bi-convex tablets that is tailored to the GPU. We firstly validate the algorithm and implementation against a number of experiments. Finally we perform a simulation of 20 million tablets in a drum coater to illustrate the usefulness of GPU computing for industrial coating applications. We found that the proposed method yields a good match against the lab scale experiments. For the industrial simulation the proposed method gave a more accurate result compared to the multi sphere approach while being significantly faster. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID VELOCITY
AB Rotor-stator mixers are used in many industries to perform emulsification and de-agglomeration processes. Despite previous research, different modes of operation have not been compared in terms of flow and power characteristics. The aim of this study was to use CFD to investigate power and flow characteristics of a Silverson L5M mixer operating in batch and in-line mode. MRF was used along with the standard k - epsilon turbulence model for the simulations. Results suggest that batch mixers can be characterised in the same was as in-line mixers, and for a given mixing head design, the characterisation is independent of the mode of operation. A new way of the calculating flow number is proposed, which explains some discrepant results from previous studies. Overall, this work enhances our understanding of rotor-stator mixers and allows for better design choices of mixer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bubble column reactors with exothermic reactions are often equipped with dense tube bundle heat exchangers. While there is some knowledge about the impact of such internals on hydrodynamics and mass transfer for narrow columns, its role in pilot-scale columns is less clear. In this paper we report on a study of hydrodynamics and mass transfer in a BCR of 4.2 m height and 0.392 m diameter. We investigated different tube arrangements with triangular and square pitch and tube diameters of 32 x 10(-3) m and 45 x 10(-3) m at the same cross-sectional coverage (similar to 25%). The column was operated at homogeneous and heterogeneous flow conditions. A customized three-layer wire-mesh sensor was utilized to visualize gas phase dynamics and liquid mixing characteristics in the column's cross-section. We found that sub-channel size is the most crucial geometric design parameter. Tracer mixing experiments revealed that internals reduce the mixing time due to the induction of large-scale liquid circulation. Mass transfer was studied with the oxygen stripping method. Here we found, that the effect of the internals on the gas-liquid mass transfer is almost negligible. Eventually, correlations for gas holdup, axial liquid dispersion and the volumetric gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient are given, which take the internals' geometry into account.

AB The overall kinetics of catalytic combustion of hydrogen in air is decided by the contribution of the different resistances offered in individual steps such as external diffusion, internal diffusion and surface reaction. To estimate the contribution of external mass transfer resistance, empirical correlations in terms of dimensionless numbers viz., Sherwood number, particle Reynold's number, and Schmidt number are used in general. The Schmidt number for hydrogen in air is approximately 0.2 and most of the mass transfer correlations in packed bed reactors are valid for Schmidt number higher than 0.6, which corresponds to that of water vapour in the air. The external mass transfer correlations applicable for hydrogen-air system are scarce. In the present study, the external mass transfer effects were decoupled from internal diffusion and intrinsic reaction by conducting experiments with different particle Reynolds numbers in a packed bed batch reactor with complete recycle. Further, the system is theoretically modeled and the external film mass transfer coefficients were estimated at different particle Reynold's numbers using experimental data. Based on the experimental data, a new mass transfer correlation has been proposed to determine the gas film mass transfer coefficient of hydrogen in the air in packed bed reactors, in terms of conventional dimensionless numbers i.e., Sherwood number, Schmidt number, and particle Reynolds number. Further, the contribution of external mass transfer resistance on the overall reaction kinetics was also estimated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current treatment process of Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) has been a cause of concern over recent years as POME is known to cause greenhouse gas emission as well as water pollution. An alternative for POME treatment process optimization is to eliminate the conventional cooling ponds and introduce a dewatering device such as a thickener. The thickener will assist in the solid-liquid separation, removal of microbes and other impurities from the wastewater. The latter will contribute to making the anaerobic digesters used to treat POME more efficient by allowing a means of control on the digesters' load. However, to be able to design and predict the performance of the thickener unit; essential rheological properties of the suspension have to be determined. The rheological characteristics and the compressive behavior of POME have not been studied previously nor has the implementation of such a dewatering device in the POME treatment process. This paper attempts to bridge the gap on the rheological characteristics, the compressive behavior and the effect of temperature on the rheological properties of POME through batch settling and batch filtration experiments. Data such as the compressive yield stress, the hindered settling function, and the diffusivity function for POME have been extracted and evaluated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A hydrate-based technology is suggested for the desalination of industrial effluents, especially electro-plating effluents including NiCl2. To decrease the required energy for operating a hydrate-based desalination (HBD) process, chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2) was used as a guest for hydrate formation at relatively mild conditions. The phase equilibria of CHClF2 hydrates formed in aqueous NiCl2 solutions were investigated to identify the effect of NiCl2 on the thermodynamic stability of CHClF2 hydrates. The dissociation phase boundary of CHClF2 hydrates in the presence of NiCl2 was shifted to higher pressures and lower temperatures as the salinity of aqueous solutions increased. To confirm the feasibility of NiCl2 separation from wastewaters via the HBD process, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic measurements were performed. The results showed that the Ni2+ and Cl- ions did not participate in the hydrate framework, which revealed that the HBD process could be used to remove NiCl2 from effluents. The formation kinetics of CHClF2 hydrates were analyzed by a new kinetic model adopting transient time-dependent apparent rate constants, which significantly depends on the sub-cooling temperature and the concentration of NiCl2 in the aqueous solutions. Thermodynamic approximations regarding the Ni2+ and Cl- ion exclusion from the clathrate framework and the full occupancy of CHClF2 molecules in the large cages of structure I clathrate hydrate were confirmed by comparing the calculated Ni2+ concentrations in the liquid phase in equilibrium with CHClF2 clathrate hydrates with the experimental measurements. These results provide good information for separating metal ions from wastewater streams by HBD processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Liquid membrane (LM) separation is a kinetic process that can be enhanced by increasing the difference between the permeation rates of the components. The addition of H(3)Cit/Na(3)Cit as a selective permeation retardant can enlarge the difference between the permeation rates of Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions when P507 was used as the extractant. This retardant is analogous to a masking agent employed in liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). However, the retardant mainly affects the LM's kinetics, while the masking agent impacts the LLE's equilibrium. It was found that the separation coefficient of the H(3)Cit/Na(3)Cit LM system could be much greater than that of the H(3)Cit/Na(3)Cit LLE system owing to the LM's kinetic effect. Following the addition of H(3)Cit/Na(3)Cit, the Cu(II) ion permeation rate was selectively retarded, and the LM selectivity of Cd(II)/Cu(II) was significantly enhanced in comparison with a control LM system. To reveal this enhancement mechanism, a new LM kinetic model was established in which the interfacial chemical reactions and mass transfer resistance in the middle connection zone of a H-type device were considered. The model's predictions agreed well with the experimental data. According to the model' quantitative analysis, the retardant affected the apparent reaction rate constants of Cd(II) and Cu(II) ions differently, and this is key to the enhancement mechanism. Aside from concentration, the LM model also predicted the variations in separation coefficient, purity, and yield with time. An optimal LM extraction time zone was defined to obtain high yield and high purity simultaneously. Finally, the enhanced LM was further verified and applied on a preliminary basis in a supported liquid membrane with strip dispersion, which is a LM technology with potential for industrial application.

AB Aqueous-phase hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NIP) by H-2 has been investigated in the presence of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) regulated by small biological molecules. Nucleosides and their derivatives were employed as capping agents of Pd NPs, and their effect on Pd activity was evaluated. All four kinds of nucleosides exhibited obvious promoting effect on the activity of Pd NPs in comparison to that without any capping agent. The general promoting effect sequence of nucleosides and their derivatives on the activity of Pd NPs was nucleoside >= nucleotide > deoxynucleoside > base > deoxynucleotide. The quantitative correlation between the activity promoting effect and the structure of nucleosides and their derivatives were also studied using the method based on poly-parameter linear free energy relationships. Moreover, the kinetic behaviors of 4-NIP hydrogenation over Pd NPs regulated by different nucleosides (adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and beta-thymidine) were studied systematically and different kinetic models were developed to fit the data. The obtained kinetic data fitted well to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) model, where the surface reaction is the rate-controlling step. The apparent activation energy, adsorption enthalpy of 4-NIP, and dissociated adsorption enthalpy of hydrogen were calculated and compared for a better understanding of the mechanism. Pd NPs regulated by cytidine showed the lowest apparent activation energy of 43.66 kJ mol(-1). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hierarchical H beta zeolite as a highly efficient solid acid catalyst

AB In this work, using phenylacetylene as alkenylating agent, the alkenylation of p-xylene on a series of hierarchical H beta (Hier-H beta) zeolites prepared by a modified steam-assisted conversion (SAC) method under different preparation conditions was firstly investigated. Various characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), argon adsorption-desorption, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), pyridine-IR (Py-IR), and thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) were adopted to discover the relationship of structure-performance in alkenylation. The results demonstrate that the optimized Hier-H beta zeolite exhibits an outstanding alkenylation catalytic performance, which is much better than the traditional microporous H beta zeolite. It can be found that the alkenylation catalytic properties of the as-prepared Hier-H beta zeolites are dramatically affected by their properties of acidic sites and textural properties, which are significantly dependent on the preparation process parameters for SAC process. Moreover, the spent Hier-H beta zeolite catalyst can be completely refreshed by a simple calcination method. In a word, the optimized Hier-H beta catalyst prepared by a modified SAC approach demonstrates great potential to promote alkenylation of aromatics with alkynes to their corresponding alkylaromatics.

AB Using CFD simulation, we first investigated the flow field distribution of the tridimensional rotational flow sieve tray (TRST) under different structural parameters (i.e. number of the blades, twist angle of the blades, tray height and sieve hole diameter) and installation methods (forward and backward) when gas flows downward through the TRST. Secondly, we carried out a comparative study of three modified structures of the tray, i.e. no supporting ring, a closed internal cylinder and no sieve holes present. Finally, we studied the transformed situations of the rotational flow and propose a dimensionless correlation to evaluate the performance of the tray. The results show that, apart from the tray with a smaller twist angle of the blade, the gas flow field distributions for all the other types of trays are similar. When two trays are installed, the gas flow field of the second tray in a forward installation is obviously different to that of a backward installation. The transformed position of the rotational flow for most types of trays is about half the depth of the tray. After comprehensive evaluation, the optimized tray structures are identified as a configuration with 8 blades, a 90 degrees twist angle of the blades, a tray height of 40 mm, and sieve holes of 5 mm diameter. In addition, the tray should have open internal cylinder without a supporting ring. When a multi-tray is installed, the backward installation method should be adopted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We presented an improved preparation method to generate cryogels with controllable pore size. It included 5 stages: pre-cooling, pre-crystallization, crystal growth, freezing, and thawing (PPCFT); crystal growth was the key step. Chitosan (CS) cryogels with uniform and honeycomb-like structures were prepared with the method, and then the properties of these cryogels were studied. The results demonstrated that the mean pore diameters of CS cryogels were successfully controlled in a wide range (approximately 60-240 mu m, by scanning electron microscope) by simply varying the temperature and time of crystal growth. The crystal growth law of this process was described by an empirical equation based on the classical theory for Ostwald ripening by Lifshitz, Slyozov, and Wagner (LSW). Furthermore, the hydrodynamics performance (permeability and column efficiency) of CS cryogel columns clearly varied with crystal growth conditions, while both the accessible porosity and water absorption ratio remained at a high level.

AB Bubbly flows are characterised by instabilities that appear in the form of elongated meso-scale structures aligned along the direction of gravity. The instabilities result in a non-homogeneous distribution of the gas fraction in the system where high-cluster and high-voidage regions coexist. The correct prediction of the meso-scale dynamics is fundamental to formulate more accurate closure models for coarsegrained simulations applied to design systems of industrial scale. Two different frameworks are compared to test their capability of capturing the characteristic meso-scale structures (understood as hetereogeneities in the gas fraction distribution with dimensions larger than the bubble size and smaller than the typical lengths of the system): the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model and a Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. This kind of benchmark has been already applied to gas-particle flows, but based to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time when the comparison between different frameworks is used to investigate the meso-scale flow structures of bubbly suspensions. We show that the Eulerian-Eulerian simulations are affected at low bubble loadings by unphysical numerical instabilities appearing due to the lack of hyperbolicity of the governing equation system. Unfortunately, the occurrence of the numerical instabilities cannot be predicted a priori, but when they are not present in the solution, the two frameworks are able to predict the same meso-scale dynamics. Our analysis suggests that, concerning meso-scale simulations, the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach produces physically faithful results and represents an ideal framework to formulate new closure models. The well-known limit of this methodology to extract parameter-independent Eulerian statistics has been addressed linking the post-processing technique to physical phenomenologies. In particular, we show that a characteristic post-processing length scale smaller than two bubble diameters is needed to correctly capture the phenomenologies associated with bubble small-scale clusters.

AB Spherical 0.5-1 mm iron-manganese oxide with the Fe/Mn molar ratio of 2:1 (Fe67) was studied for thermochemical energy storage (TCES) system. Iron and manganese oxide are abundant, low-cost, and nontoxic; three ideal materials characteristics for TCES applications. Fe67 was reduced in both argon and air environments. A thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) were used to investigate reaction kinetics and the enthalpy of reduction. A shrinking core model fit the non-isothermal kinetic data obtained from four heating rates. It is hypothesized that thermal reduction of Fe67 is controlled by oxygen internal diffusion for an inert atmosphere, while oxygen internal diffusion followed by oxygen external diffusion control the process in an air environment. A reduction reaction rate expression was derived and is useful for reactor design. This is the first kinetics investigation for Fe67 active redox material and its first consideration for TCES applications.Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study introduces a novel methodology for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), based on a combined approach of data and process knowledge driven techniques. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) detects the abnormalities based on process history while the Bayesian Network (BN) diagnoses the root causes of faults. An HMM is trained with standard operating condition data while the structure of BN is developed based on process knowledge. The log-likelihoods (LL) of process historical data strings are used to establish the conditional probability tables of the BN. HMM identifies the abnormal behaviour of the system. The time of detection of abnormality, respective log-likelihood value, and the probabilities of being in the process condition at the time of detection are used as evidence to BN. The updated BN is then used to diagnose the root cause by considering the respective changes in the probabilities. Performance of the new technique is tested and validated with published data of Tennessee Eastman Process. Eight of the ten selected faults were successfully detected and diagnosed.

AB The crystallization of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) is an important, but complex unit operation in drug manufacturing industry, due to the diverse chemical nature of medicinal formulation compounds, several physicochemical phenomena that take place during particle formation process, and multi-phase governing resistances. This research paper presents a combined experimental-modelling approach to understanding fesoterodine fumarate crystallization and dissolution in 2-butanone. A rigorous in-house mechanistic model algorithm that includes calibration, thermodynamic equilibrium description, energy, mass and population balance equations, heat transfer limitations, and ordering, agglomeration and detachment step kinetics was developed. On the basis of experimentally-determined saturated solubility, a specified initial number of designed dissolution and cooling crystallization experiments was performed, monitored by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) technique and microscopy. The estimated kinetic parameters of transport, nucleation, crystal lattice growth, agglomeration and dissolution were evaluated by fitting the measured/simulated concentration curves with crystallite size distributions. Correlation was validated with additional trial results, observing a rather good agreement. The behaviour of the component during validations' temperature cycling was thoroughly examined by simulations to achieve a solid final insight into mechanisms, which may aid further production development, optimization, as well as scale-up.

AB Magnetite nanoparticles have been successfully produced by the electro-oxidation of iron in water using a monopolar arrangement of iron electrodes. Two types of monopolar configurations were used: conventional monopolar (CM) and alternating monopolar (AM). The production rate of the magnetite nanoparticles could be increased significantly (similar to 30 times higher) by using the AM electrode arrangement compared to the production rate of one-pair of electrodes in the same system. The particle sizes ranged from 28 to 88 nm for the CM and from 20 to 25 nm for the AM arrangements. The performance of the AM arrangement was superior that of the CM arrangement in regard to production rate, particle size, and product purity. A numerical simulation showed distinguishable electric fields between the AM and CM arrangements. The magnetite particles produced using the CM arrangement contained impurities in the form of FeOOH and Fe2O3. On the other hand, only magnetite was identified in the particles prepared using the AM arrangement. In addition, particle morphologies other than spherical could also be produced using the AM arrangement by changing the operating condition.

AB Nanoscale zero-valent iron has been widely applied in environmental remediation and toxic waste treatment, especially for the degradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, the dechlorination activity of Fe nanoparticles (Fe NPs) can be suppressed by the precipitation of iron oxides generated from the corrosion of Fe-Pd NPs under alkaline conditions, leading to a decreased dechlorination efficiency. Faced with this challenge, we report a highly effective dechlorination system that functions over a broad pH range and especially well under alkaline conditions in this work. Procyanidin (PROC), a natural polyphenol, was utilized as a stabilizer to manipulate the size distribution of Fe-Pd NPs and, more importantly, as a scavenger of Fe ions to prevent iron oxide precipitation. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the generated Fe ions was mainly present in the form of bis- and tris-PROC-Fe complexes in the reaction solution. Compared with pristine Fe-Pd NPs, the PROC-modified Fe-Pd NPs had a dechlorination efficiency that was increased 20-fold (pH 9.0). Notably, a normalized rate constant was enhanced by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to the previously reported dechlorination systems. The PROC-modified Fe-Pd NPs showed excellent dechlorination efficiency over a wide pH range (2.3-13.0). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study attempts to characterize the time-dependent three-dimensional hydrodynamics in a stirred tank reactor using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The rotating propellers produce a complex, unsteady, three-dimensional turbulent flow field. This results in efficient mixing and is therefore widely used in various process engineering applications. The time-dependent turbulent single-phase flow is computed using large eddy simulation, relying on the sliding mesh approach. The unresolved subgrid scales are treated using the Smagorinsky-Lilly model. The dominant coherent flow structures are characterized in the entire three-dimensional computational domain using the 3D proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique. The design of the propeller is evaluated in a separate POD analysis in a rotating frame which encloses the propeller. The most energetic POD modes characterize the organized large scale structures, the so-called coherent flow structures, while the higher modes correspond to the small-scale disorganized turbulence. It was found that the dynamics of the main flow structures can be reconstructed using only 3 modes corresponding to 98% of the overall energy in the entire 3D inner rotating domain and 21 modes are necessary for the same amount of energy in the outer stationary region.
   Furthermore, the macro instability (MI) was characterized by monitoring the velocity in more than 1 million computational cells, as well as using FFT analyses of the three-dimensional POD temporal coefficients. In the outer stationary domain, both approaches showed characteristic frequencies around one-eighth and one-fifth of the blade passage frequency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we developed a method to represent petroleum molecules and reconstruct the molecular composition of petroleum fractions. A hybrid framework combining structural units and a bond-electron matrix (SU-BEM) was proposed to represent petroleum molecules in a convenient way and retain all the detailed atomic information. The structural units and bond-electron matrix represent the basic structural components and the atom connectivity of petroleum molecules, respectively. The group contribution method was implemented in the framework to predict the physical and chemical properties of petroleum molecules based on their chemical structures. Good agreement was observed for the property calculations of pure low-carbon number components. A flexible probability density function (PDF) sequence module was developed and used in the sampling procedure to obtain the molecular quantities used in the compositional models. The PDF parameters, as well as molecular compositions, were optimized by minimizing the differences between predicted and experimental properties. The method was validated for applications involving diesel, vacuum gas oil, and fluid catalytic cracking slurry oil. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The kinetics of the non-catalytic gas-solid reaction between MnOx/gamma-Al(2)O(3 )and SO2 were investigated. A mathematical model based on axial dispersion, external and internal diffusion resistance, as well as a depletion mechanism for the sorbent has been established in this study. It predicted the breakthrough curves of packed bed (PB) and microfibrous entrapped sorbent (MFES) with acceptable deviations. This model consists of two predetermined parameters: the initial sorption rate constant (k(o)) and the depletion rate constant (k(d)), which can be determined by fitting the model to experimental data at various temperatures. Due to the uniform flow pattern and minimized bed channeling, MFES outperformed conventional PB consisting of the same sorbent particle size in terms of the reduction in SO2 concentration. The MFES surpassed PB significantly during the in situ regeneration in anode exhaust gas (AEG). Furthermore, MFES maintained its high breakthrough capacity up to five adsorption/regeneration cycles. Therefore, the MFES is a superior approach to remove the potential SO2 from the fuel cell cathode air stream for practical applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) separate the redox active electrolytes and transfer the charge carriers in redox flow batteries. During the long-term operation of a redox flow battery, the formation and propagation of cracks in AEMs are detrimental, resulting in capacity loss and self-discharge, while replacing the cracked membranes would increase the cost. Here we incorporate self-healing to an AEM through reversible and temperature-controlled Diels-Alder (DA) reaction. We first synthesized a block copolymer from vinylbenzyl chloride and 2-((4-vinylbenzyloxy) methyl) furan by RAFT polymerization. The benzylic chloride moiety was quaternized with trimethylamine to conduct anions, while bismaleimide was added to dynamically connect the furan moieties via DA reaction. By solution casting and reacting at 80 degrees C, an AEM with dynamic network was prepared. When evaluated for practical application, we found the AEM has a Cl conductivity of 32.7 mS cm( 1) at 80 degrees C and man-made cracks on the membrane can be self-healed. We then tested its performance in a pH 7 aqueous organic redox flow battery, where it delivered stable cycling performances over 100 consecutive charge/discharge cycles, with a coulombic efficiency of >97% and an energy efficiency of >79%. This membrane is promising for practical applications and what we report here is a useful strategy in rendering conventional AEMs with self-healing property. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There has been great recent interest in the potential use of Nanoparticles as modifiers or alternatives to surfactants for stabilizing emulsions, among which silica NPs have been commonly used as the most cost effective option. Since silica NPs are hydrophilic with a tendency toward the aqueous phase, their surface should be activated either by the aid of a surfactant or by chemical treatment. The aim of the present work is to assess the effect of two chemically activated silica NPs on stability of dodecane-water emulsions through optical microscopy. Therefore, hydrophilic silica NPs are firstly synthesized with sodium silicate solution and are subsequently silanized with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) into different extents to synthesize two different NPs with different wettability states, namely as HSNP1 and HSNP2. The degree of Nanoparticle wettability is quantified by the variation of the silanol group density of bare silica NPs, which has reduced by 49% for HSNP1, resulting in partially hydrophobic silica NPs and by 60% for HSNP2, resulting in hydrophobic silica NPs. The emulsion stability prepared by HSNP1 and HSNP2 has been assessed via both bottle tests and droplet size distribution analysis, which is tracked by fitting proper distribution functions on the experimental data. The log-normal and the bimodal (a mixture of two log-normal distribution) distribution functions are respectively fitted on the droplet size distribution of emulsions stabilized by HSNP1 and HSNP2. This revealed minor changes in the droplet size distribution of emulsions stabilized by partially hydrophobic silica NPs (HSNP1) over a month, while a significant alteration in droplet size distribution of emulsions stabilized by hydrophobic silica NPs (HSNP2) has been observed after a week. Higher emulsion stability stabilized by HSNP1 is also confirmed by higher zeta potential value and higher surface coverage of partially hydrophobic silica NPs (HSNP1) compared to that of hydrophobic silica NPs (HSNP2). The partially hydrophobic silica NPs, wetted to the same extent by both liquid phases has been found to be suitable for stabilizing emulsions for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) applications.

AB Aiming to prepare pervaporation membranes with confined mass transfer channels, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with and without functionalization were incorporated into polyurethane (PU) polymer matrices. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy were employed to explore the effect of functionalization on the morphologies of MWCNTs. The changes in the morphologies of the resulting PU hybrid membrane were then characterized by SEM, TEM, and XRD. Swelling-sorption and pervaporation experiments of benzene and cyclohexane were employed to evaluate the separation performances of various hybrid membranes. The results showed that the introduction of many oxygenated functional groups onto the MWCNT surfaces through functionalization not only efficiently inhibited the MWCNT aggregation but also improved the distributions of the MWCNTs in solvents and polymer materials. Due to the 1D tube structures of the MWCNTs with conjugated pi bonds, the addition of well-distributed MWCNTs into the hybrid membranes not only increased the benzene sorption abilities of the membranes but also enhanced the benzene diffusion selectivities due to the strong driving force for the molecules in the confined mass transfer channels. A higher content of well-distributed MWCNTs in the membrane yielded a higher separation performance for benzene. Additionally, increasing the operating temperature in the pervaporation experiments accelerated the molecular motion and weakened the affinity between the benzene molecules and the walls of the MWCNTs, increasing the permeation fluxes of the membranes while decreasing the benzene separation factors.

AB Direct numerical simulations of an aggregation system composed of monosized spherical particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence have been performed using Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The effects of hydrodynamics on the aggregation process were considered by directly resolving the disturbance flows around finite-size solid particles using an interpolated bounce-back scheme. A nonuniform time-dependent large-scale stochastic forcing scheme was implemented within the mesoscopic multiple-relaxation-time LBM approach to maintain turbulence intensity at targeted levels. To simulate particle interactions, the non-contact surface force and the contact force were taken into account using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory and the soft-sphere model, respectively. This interface-resolved direct numerical simulation (IR-DNS) combined with the well-known DLVO theory was employed to obtain an insight into the aggregation process of micron-size particles. Specifically, the model was used to study the effects of solid volume fraction on aggregate growth. Aggregates of larger sizes formed in local regions of higher concentration of particles due to higher encountering probability between particles. The effects of aggregating particles of different volume fractions on the statistically stationary homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow were investigated. It was found that the presence of particles attenuated the turbulent kinetic energy at large scales and augmented the kinetic energy at the small scales. This effect is more apparent with increasing volume concentration of particles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spontaneous imbibition of nanofluid has attracted much interest in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in ultralow permeable reservoirs. However, the oil distribution in ultralow permeable cores during the spontaneous imbibition using nanofluids has not been discussed in detail. In this study, imbibition experiment and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement were used to monitor the migration rule of nanofluid and oil distribution in the imbibition. The results show that 70.82-71.98 wt% of the oil was distributed in mesopores (50 nm < pore size < 3000 nm). The final oil recoveries of cores immersed in different concentrations of nanofluids (0.1 wt%, 0.05 wt%, 0.01 wt%, and 0.005 wt%) and brine were 32.5%, 26.9%, 20.5%, 15.1%, and 8.3%, respectively. The NMR spectra and imaging show that the nanoparticles seeped into the core. Significant insight into the oil distribution during the imbibition of nanofluid is provided. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Accurate determination of the size of nanoparticles has an important role in many different scientific and industrial purposes, such as in material, medical and environment sciences, colloidal chemistry and astrophysics. We describe an effective optical method to determine the size of nanoparticles by analysis of transmission and scattering of visible spectral range data from a designed UV-Vis multi-spectrophotometer. The size of the nanoparticles was calculated from the extinction cross section of the particles using Rayleigh approximation and Mie theory. We validated the method using polystyrene nanospheres, cellulose nanofibrils, and cellulose nanocrystals. A good agreement was achieved through graphical analysis between measured extinction cross section values and theoretical Rayleigh approximation and Mie theory predictions for the sizes of polystyrene nanospheres at wavelength range 450-750 nm. Provided that Rayleigh approximation's forward scattering (FS)/back scattering (BS) ratio was smaller than 1.3 and Mie theory's FS/BS ratio was smaller than 1.8. A good fit for the hydrodynamic diameter of nanocellulose was achieved using the Mie theory and Rayleigh approximation. However, due to the high aspect ratio of nanocellulose, the obtained results do not directly reflect the actual cross-sectional diameters of the nanocellulose. Overall, the method is a fast, relatively easy, and simple technique to determine the size of a particle by a spectrophotometer. Consequently, the method can be utilized for example in production and quality control purposes as well as for research and development applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultra-thin, oxidation-resistant, pinhole-free alumina coatings were deposited on silicon carbide (SiC) particles using atomic layer deposition (ALD), and investigated as environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) for high-temperature steam oxidation. The uncoated and alumina coated SiC particles were exposed to high temperature steam for 20 hat temperatures ranging from 1050 degrees C to 1150 degrees C to assess oxidation rates. The kinetic triplet (activation energy, rate constant, and pre-exponential factor) for each sample was determined using the D4 kinetic model (representing 3-dimensional diffusion) which was demonstrated to be accurate via the isothermal isoconversional method. Activation energies for oxidation of 247.4 +/- 0.1 kJ/mol, 250.6 +/- 0.5 kJ/mol, and 253.0 +/- 1.0 kJ/mol were calculated for uncoated SiC, SiC coated with a 5 nm alumina film, and SiC coated with a 10 nm alumina film, respectively. Reaction rate data for the oxidation reaction of uncoated SiC and SiC coated with a 10 nm film indicate that the ALD coating reduces the rate of oxidation of SiC by up to a factor of 5 for steam oxidation at temperatures between 1050 degrees C and 1150 degrees C. This is the first investigation of steam oxidation kinetics for SiC coated with an ALD deposited EBC. The results of this study indicate that ultra-thin alumina films deposited by ALD act as effective EBCs with oxidation resistance comparable to CVD films that are orders of magnitude thicker.

AB The bubble size distribution plays an important role in interfacial mass, momentum and energy transfer between bubbles and their carrier liquid in bubbly flow. Accurate modeling of the size distribution is therefore key. A Log-Normal presumed Number Density Function (LNpNDF) approach is proposed, which is embedded into the two-fluid model. Two additional moment transport equations are formulated which are shown to be consistent with the two-fluid model. From the moments, the size distribution can be fully reconstructed using the assumption that its underlying shape is log-normal. This methodology offers closure for the modeling of processes such as bubble coalescence, break-up and bubble poly-celerity. Special attention is paid to the concept of poly-celerity, which is shown to play an important role in the evolution of finite-width size distributions. A new average diameter, which is based on the fifth and third moment of the size distribution, is proposed, and it is shown that this diameter is a more suitable quadrature node for the modeling of bubble-liquid Stokes-like drag. The paper lays the mathematical foundation for a pragmatic, computationally efficient and effective poly-dipsersed method for the modeling of dispersed two-phase flow. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the current work, the impacts of local thermal non-equilibrium model and Al2O3-water nanofluid on natural convection heat transfer in a porous cavity consisting of a bottom heated wavy wall and an inner solid cylinder are investigated. The Galerkin weighted residual finite element method is utilized to simulate the dimensionless governing equations of the fluid flow and heat transfer. The effects of different parameters including Darcy number (10(-6) <= Da <= 10(-2) ), nanoparticle volume fraction (0 <= phi <= 0.04), modified conductivity ratio (0.01 <= gamma <= 1000), number of undulations (1 <= N <= 4) and the porosity of the medium (0.2 <= epsilon <= 0.8) on the field of the flow and the heat transfer mechanisms are described. The Forchheimer-Brinkman-extended Darcy model along with the Boussinesq approximation are assumed to hold. A comprehensive validation of the present code is obtained by comparing the results with those of previous studies. The results show that all the mentioned parameters have significant impacts on the fluid flow and the temperature distributions. In addition, increasing the thermal conductivity of the nanoparticles leads to an increase in the rate of heat transfer for the nanofluid condition and reaches its maximum value at phi = 0.04. Considering high values of epsilon, the average Nusselt number increases by the augmentation of phi, while at low values of the porosity, the average Nusselt number decreases after reaching a peak. The results of this study are very useful for designing a porous heat exchanger. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The enhancement of gas-liquid mass transfer by baffles embedded in a microchannel was investigated experimentally for CO2 absorption into monoethanolamine/1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (MEA/Bmim][BF4]) aqueous solutions. The influences of baffle size on mass transfer rate and pressure drop were studied through varying the MEA/[Bmim][BE4] concentration ratio, gas-liquid flow rate and blockage ratio. Experimental results showed that the proper baffle configuration could improve effectively gas-liquid mass transfer performance. Although the pressure drop of the baffled microchannel has slight increase (the maximum growth 0.3 kPa, or 20% in relative term) in comparison with the unobstructed microchannel, it is acceptable for industrial application. Under lower MEA/[Bmim][BE4] concentration ratios, higher two-phase flow rates and blockage ratios, the mass transfer enhancement is more pronounced and the enhancement factor could reach to 1.5. A new empirical correlation of enhancement factor is proposed with good predictive performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of ultrasonic waves on subcooled pool boiling on a small plain heating surface. Ultrasonic waves with different amplitudes (0-10 mu m) were applied for both nucleate boiling and transition boiling modes with the liquid subcooling and heat flux covering 15-60 K and 0.15-8 MW/m(2) , respectively. The results show that the acoustic streaming induced by high amplitude ultrasound has an obvious enhancement effect on nucleate boiling at low heat flux, but the augmentation will be restricted with increase in heat flux and decrease in ultrasonic amplitude. In transition boiling region, the ultrasound makes different impact. At liquid subcooling of 15 K under which microbubble emission boiling (MEB) would not occur normally, the strong acoustic streaming triggers MEB, thereby heat transfer is significantly enhanced. At subcooling of 21-40 K, the transition boiling is in the mode of stable MEB, the ultrasound barely affects the heat transfer and bubble behaviors. With the subcooling increasing to 50-60 K, the heat transfer of MEB is enhanced by the 10 mu m amplitude ultrasound but deteriorated by the 5 um amplitude ultrasound. The opposite results depend on the different effects arising from the ultrasound on the collapse and oscillation of the vapor film on the heating surface. (C)2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present work is aimed to investigate the catalytic activities of various Mn-based MOFs for carbon dioxide coupling with epoxides. The metal organic frameworks, [(CH3NH3][Mn(COOH)(3)] (MA-MnF), [(CH3CH2NH3][Mn(COOH)(3)] (EA-MnF), and [C3H5N2][Mn(COOH)(3)] (Im-MnF) were studied via several characterizations such as XRD, FT-IR, XPS, N-2-adsorption, TG-DSC, CO2 -adsorption and NH3-TPD. Interestingly, Im-MnF compound was observed to possess the highest catalytic activity among the studied compounds, which is associated not only with the amounts of basic sites, but also related to the nitrogen-containing species. 97.27% conversion of allyl-glycidyl ether (AGE, TOF: 36.78 h(-1)) and 97.66% selectivity to allyl-glycidyl carbonate (AGC) were obtained under the explored optimized conditions (100 degrees C, 15 bar, 6 h, 1.0 wt% of AGE). In addition, only a slight downward in catalytic activity was found when the sample was reused twice. Furthermore, coupling reactions of CO2 with various epoxides were also performed, of which, the yield of the cyclic carbonates followed the order: Epichlorohydrin > Allyl glycidyl ether > Styrene oxide > Cyclohexene oxide > Propylene oxide. Finally, a mechanism was proposed, which is in good agreement with the DFT calculation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coalescence of two unequal-sized droplets on hydrophobic fibers is more common in nature. To elucidate the mechanism of merged droplets jumping on hydrophobic fibers, a new theoretical model for two unequal-sized droplets coalescence was first developed, which considered the effects of contact angle hysteresis and droplet-fiber contact area. Then, the influences of Ohnesorge number (Oh), droplet radius ratio (n), droplet-fiber radius ratio (k) and contact angle (CA) on the dimensionless jumping velocity (U/v(ci)) were studied theoretically. The value of U/v(ci) increased with the increase of n, k and CA but decreased as Oh increased. The dimensionless jumping velocity for two unequal-sized droplets coalescence on hydrophobic fibers still followed the capillary-inertial scaling law with U/v(ci) approximate to 0.45 when n = 0.5. In addition, the effects of k and CA on the critical jumping radius ratio were the critical jumping radius ratio being reduced as k and CA increased, and the minimal critical jumping radius ratio was approximately 0.1. These findings will help to characterize coalescence-induced droplet jumping on hydrophobic fibers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An approach for determination of effective oxygen diffusivity within a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell cathode catalyst layer by combining tomography and geometric calculations is presented. Accurate determination of effective oxygen diffusivity is critical for modeling and characterization of cathode design architectures. In silico geometric characterization methods exploit the increasing availability, capability, and decreasing cost of tomographic imaging and high-performance computing. Geometric methods can be made simple and fast and could accelerate efforts to iteratively improve cathode design. The method described herein relied on mathematically exact and statistically significant definitions of geometric tortuosity and geometric constrictivity, in addition to porosity. To demonstrate generality and robustness, a correlation for obstruction factor underpinned by these parameters was statistically induced from hundreds of instantiations of stochastic cathode microstructures generated by a simulated annealing method and validated versus the obstruction factor of real cathode microstructures obtained separately by Star and Fuller in a previous publication and Ziegler et al. at the University of Freiburg. This work demonstrated the utility and viability of adopting a combined tomography/geomet ric-computational approach for determination of the effective diffusivity of reactant in the cathode catalyst layer and its underlying transport properties. This analysis was based on a conventional cathode microstructure with platinum catalyst, carbon black support, and perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer. However, the method could easily be extended to platinum group metal-free cathodes in which accurate characterization may be of even greater importance due to the thicker cathode layers required in these systems. This approach could be widely adopted and relied upon for characterization as the materials and processing conditions of cathode layers are iteratively tested and optimized. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We report a high-productivity chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process of graphene by extending the reaction field to three dimensions (3D) and shortening the CVD time to a few minutes. A large Cu foil (5 x 30 cm(2)) is rolled up and set in a small reactor (3.4 cm in diameter), and a continuous graphene film is obtained uniformly in a short time (1.5 min) by using C2H4 as a more reactive carbon source than the popular CH4. The graphene transferred onto a quartz glass showed optical transmittances of 94.8-96.7% (550 nm) with sheet resistances of 0.78-1.68 K Omega sq(1) (without doping) and 0.3 K Omega sq(1) (with doping by HNO3 vapor). Compared with the previous reports for fast and/or large-scale CVD, our method realized similarly high productivity of 100 cm(2) min (1) based on the CVD time despite of the small reactor, and higher productivity of 0.03 cm(2)-graphene per cm(3) -reactor per minute based on the reactor volume and total time for high temperature processing (15 min for heating, 1 min for annealing, and 1.5 min for CVD). The knowledge obtained here on the CVD conditions and packing ratio of Cu foils (0.55 cm(2) per cm(3)-reactor) is reusable for designing large-scale graphene production processes.

AB Currently, studies on bubble velocity in yield stress fluids with low Reynolds numbers are lacking. In most engineering applications, such value is often calculated using predictive models developed for viscous fluids. However, these models are only applicable to yield stress fluids in limited conditions because the bubble rise velocity is affected by the yield stress in these fluids significantly. In this study, a velocity field model around a bubble is first developed by performing an infinitesimal analysis of the velocity field in the equatorial plane of the bubble and combining the continuity equation with the constitutive equation of yield stress fluids. Next, a new model is proposed for predicting bubble velocity in yield stress fluids at a low transport rate by integrating the model of velocity field around the bubble with energy conservation equations. Finally, experimental studies are performed to analyze the bubble transport behavior in yield stress fluids at low Reynolds numbers. The experimental results showed that under a low Reynolds number, the bubble rise velocity is dominated by the yield stress of the fluid. Hence, we further validated the proposed bubble velocity prediction model with experimental measurements, which match closely with each other. We conclude that for a Reynolds number less than 0.4, the model developed in this study can be used to predict the bubble velocity in yield stress fluids with high accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Before performing any in-depth analytics, an important issue in dealing with historical dynamic data is to extract data segments from the operation data. The raw data always involve different kinds of patterns over a long series of sequences because of the operation changes or some faults. Conventional methods for identifying the patterns are based on variance or covariance, but the indices designed from variance or covariance are not necessarily able to cover the process dynamics completely, so the precision degradation of segmentations will be induced. This paper designs a new dissimilarity index based on the auto-correlation function to deal with dynamic data. And a fast and high-efficient segmentation algorithm using interval halving and the moving window is proposed to locate the change points of data patterns. Moreover, a new dynamic performance assessment index is designed to find the optimal segment in the dataset. Two case studies, including a numerical example and a distillation column benchmark, validate the advantages of the proposed scheme over the conventional variance-based methods.

AB The pulsed disc and doughnut column (PDDC) is a widely used type of liquid-liquid extraction equipment. Both the research and design of this type of equipment require in-depth knowledge of the dispersed phase droplet size distribution (DSD). The coupling of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and population balance model (PBM) has exhibited a significant potential for predicting the DSD by considering droplet breakage and coalescence. In the present work, the CFD-PBM simulation is adopted to predict the DSD, and to investigate local liquid-liquid flow behaviors in a square-sectioned PDDC. The empirical correlations of the breakup kernels, which are based on our previous work [Hao Zhou et al., Direct measurement of droplet breakage in a pulsed disc and doughnut column. AIChE Journal, 2017, 63(9), 4188-4200], are implemented in the CFD code. For comparison, the kernel functions obtained by Coulaloglou and Tavlarides [Coulaloglou and Tavlarides. Description of interaction processes in agitated liquid-liquid dispersions. Chemical Engineering Science, 1977, 32, 1289-1297] are also tested. The class method with the fixed pivot technique is utilized to solve the population balance equations. The droplet size distribution predicted by the CFD-PBM simulation combined with the kernel functions that we have previously determined experimentally are observed to be more precise than those of Coulaloglou and Tavlarides. Accordingly, the CFD-PBM simulation results with the kernel functions of our proposed correlations are used to investigate the liquid-liquid flow behaviors in the PDDC. The influences of droplet size range and initial droplet size distribution at the dispersed phase inlet in the predicted DSD are discussed. The hydraulic performance of simulation results agrees well with experimental data. Local flow behaviors are illustrated to depict the typical flow characteristics of PDDC. The simulation results suggest that CFD-PBM method with the proposed PBM kernel functions is a promising approach for the simulation of liquid-liquid flow in the PDDC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A novel strategy has been proposed for the rigorous kinetic modeling of tyre pyrolysis in a conical spouted bed reactor. A kinetic model coupled with a gas flow model was used in the fitting of experimental results obtained in a bench scale unit in the 425-610 degrees C range. A gas flow model should be incorporated to account for the delay and mixing phenomena observed in tracer experiments, as these phenomena cause remarkable deviations in the assessment of the kinetic parameters. The gas flow pattern from the reactor to the measuring device was modeled using two different approaches based on ideal flow reactors. Furthermore, two kinetic schemes considering lumped products have been proposed; the first one is based on four parallel independent reactions accounting for the volatile products (gas, liquid, aromatics and tar). The second one considers an additional secondary reaction of aromatic formation from the liquid. The strategy proposed for coupling the kinetics and the flow model led to a suitable fitting of the experimental results, with the performance of the model considering a secondary reaction being slightly better than the simple one.

AB Cu-SAPO-34 materials with 2 wt% of copper synthesized in one pot with all the copper inside the framework are hydrothermally stable. Copper oxide species were not detected by XRD after thermal and hydrothermal aging at 750 degrees C. CO2 and H2O molecules are retained on Cu-SAPO catalyst and are related to CO2 adsorption aided by water involving the Cu-species. Copper species coordination is modified by the reaction atmosphere and the species are directly involved in the SCR-process. A decrease in the ammonia storage capacity in the presence of water has been justified due to the cooperative competition between the ammonia and water adsorption and/or CO2 carbonation over the same sites. Higher coordinated Cu species localized inside of CHA-framework, up to a loading close to 4% with this methodology, are highly efficient in the removal of NOx by reaction with ammonia, in the presence of oxygen, water (1.5%) and CO2 (0.3%) as reaction atmosphere. The SCR mechanism is essentially the same as in dry conditions because the Cu2+/Cu+ ions, in equilibrium with H2O + CO2, are the active species in the SCR-reaction. Hydrated-carbonated Cu(II) and hydrated-carbonated Cu(I) species are associated with the redox-chemistry of NOx abatement as responsible for the improvement in the standard SCR; favoring the hindering of ammonia oxidation and nitrate decomposition. In the SCR temperature range, the conversion values registered for this catalyst are higher than 80% with total selectivity to N-2. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work documents optimal flow conditions in terms of Reynolds number Re (and Dean number De) for mixing of two miscible liquids in helical pipes. Extending our previous investigations (Mansour et al., 2017, 2018), many more configurations have been considered with widely different dimensions; as a consequence, generally-valid values for Re-opt and De(opt) have been obtained. A full-factorial design of experiment (DOE) has been carried out by considering all possible combinations of geometrical parameters studied in Mansour et al. (2018). This leads to a total of 27 different coiled configurations with a wide variety of curvature ratio (0.033-0.214) and dimensionless pitch (0.034-0.273). Additionally, 47 different values of the Reynolds number have been considered within the laminar range of 5-4000, which corresponds to a Dean number range of De = 2-1850. This study involves at the end 1269 distinct numerical simulations. The results reveal that the mixing efficiency as function of the Reynolds number always exhibits two peaks at nearly similar Reynolds numbers. Average values of the two optimal ranges of Reynolds number and Dean number have been deduced from all simulations, leading to Re-opt,Re-1 approximate to 35 (De(opt,1) approximate to 10), and Re-opt,Re-2 approximate to 650 (De(opt,2) approximate to 185). Those can be used to get excellent mixing within any coiled configuration. The first optimal value leads to a much lower pressure drop and a slightly better mixing efficiency, and is therefore recommended to get optimal mixing and power consumption. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A flat Teflon AF-2400 membrane microchannel reactor was experimentally and theoretically investigated for aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol on a 5 wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. The reactor consisted of gas and liquid channels (75 mm (L) x 3 mm (W) x 1 mm (D)), separated by a 0.07 mm thick semipermeable Teflon AF-2400 flat membrane, which allowed continuous supply of oxygen during the reaction and simultaneously avoided direct mixing of gaseous oxygen with organic reactants. A catalyst stability test was first carried out, and the experimental data obtained were used to estimate the kinetics of benzyl alcohol oxidation with a 2D reactor model. Using these kinetics, predictions from the 2D reactor model agreed well with the experimental data obtained at different liquid flow rates and oxygen pressures. The mass transfer and catalytic reaction in the membrane microchannel reactor were then theoretically studied by changing the membrane thickness, the liquid channel depth, and the reaction rate coefficient. Oxygen transverse mass transport in the catalyst bed was found to be the controlling process for the system investigated, and decreasing the liquid channel depth is suggested to improve the oxygen supply and enhance the benzyl alcohol conversion in the membrane reactor.

AB The present work deals with the numerical simulations of 3D incompressible flow through periodic porous structures, consisting of cubic cells with different strut geometry and structure tilting with respect to the flow direction. Simulation results are obtained for different porosities, while covering a range of Reynolds numbers from laminar-steady flow (Darcy regime) up to the transition to laminar-unsteady flow (moderate Forchheimer regime). These results are post-processed in order to characterize the influence of the periodic porous structures on the flow statistics related to the Darcy-Forchheimer law. Based on this analysis, along with 3D simulation results previously obtained for different random foams, correlations for the Darcy and Forchheimmer permeability coefficients are developed from a theoretical background, being expressed only as functions of the cell geometrical parameters and tortuosity estimation. However, the influences of flow tortuosity and cell orientation on the Darcy coefficient are found to cancel each other. The proposed correlation for the Darcy coefficient performs very well for both periodic and random porous structures, when compared with recent correlations available in the literature. The performance of the correlation proposed for the Forchheimmer coefficient is found to be satisfactory, however, different correlation constants were found for periodic and random structures. The proposed correlation for the Forchheimer permeability coefficient depends on the flow tortuosity inside the porous structure, which must be estimated either through 3D fluid flow simulations or using tortuosity correlations. In this respect, a correlation is proposed for predicting the flow tortuosity inside porous structures, as an alternative for avoiding 3D simulations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Present study focuses on the shape of a drop during pinch-off and how the shape of a drop is affected by the flow parameters and different physical properties of the fluids. Both experimental and numerical investigations are performed to unveil the mechanism of non-spherical drop formation and the oscillatory motion of a drop after pinch-off. Numerical simulations are performed over a wide range of density ratios (0.001-0.9) and viscosity ratios (0.01-10) ranging from a gas-liquid system to a liquid-liquid system. The deformation of a drop at the incipience of pinch-off depends on the internal stress distribution within the drop. A larger velocity gradient inside the drop culminates in a stronger shear force within the drop leading to a non-spherical drop during pinch-off. We reveal that the shape of a drop remains either in prolate or in spherical form during pinch-off. A drop undergoes prolate-oblate-prolate oscillation while falling through the surrounding medium. The oscillatory motion is generated due to the local capillary pressure that develops across the drop surface because of the deformed shape of the drop after pinch-off. Present investigation reveals that the deformation of the drop because of the downward pull generated near the pinching region makes the drop shape non-spherical after pinch-off and initiates the oscillatory motion of the drop. The oscillation of a drop reduces substantially at higher relative strength of the viscous force. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this context, thermal tests were conducted in an innovative laboratory pilot. Radial temperature profiles are measured between a central hot-wire and the cooling jacket of the tube. Two models were presented in order to estimate the heat transfer coefficients from the experimental data. The results are discussed and compared with the main literature correlations.

AB Mixing process of a highly viscous Newtonian fluid in a horizontal self-cleaning twin-shaft kneader was simulated by means of finite element method combined with mesh superposition technique. Particle tracking technique was carried out based on the velocity profiles to evaluate the mixing performance. There exists a strong intermeshing interaction between the kneading bars mounted on the rotating shafts in the overlapping zone, which can disrupt the cluster and promote the material exchange in the angular position. The intermeshing kneading bars allow the infinitesimal lines associated with the material points to reorient and continue to stretch. The periodic intermeshing leads to self-cleaning and chaotic mixing characteristics. The horizontal twin-shaft kneader is efficient for mixing highly viscous fluids due to the intermeshing of kneading bars. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bubbles considerably influence the characteristics of gas-solid fluidized bed, hence play an important role in determining process performance. This paper presents a CFD-DEM study on the effect of particle shape on the bed microstructure and bubble properties in a pseudo-2D bubbling gas-solid fluidized bed, operated with a continuous central jet. The bubble formation process is successfully generated, where bubbles rise through the bed and burst at the top of the bed. The numerical results show that ellipsoids have slightly different flow patterns from those of spheres. However, the mechanisms of bubble splitting and coalescence are found strongly dependent on particle shape. For spheres, the bubble trajectories mainly follow the bed centreline, whereas the bubbles for ellipsoids are widely distributed on both sides of the bed centreline. This result suggests that the lateral drift of bubbles is high for ellipsoids because such particles prefer to orient their longest major axis in the direction of the fluid flow. At the lower part of the bed, both gas and particle velocity profiles are found axially similar to a Gaussian distribution. In contrast, at the upper part of the bed, their peaks become flatter and broader for ellipsoids. Additionally, the bubble equivalent diameters are higher for ellipsoids while bubbles become more circular for spheres. Both bubble frequency and bubble velocity for ellipsoids are lower than spheres. The results obtained from this study can improve the understanding of bubble dynamics in the fluidization of non-spherical particles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A facile and mild method for the catalytic production of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was developed, which utilized commercial PdCl2 as the catalyst together with the green, non-toxic and low-cost hydride source, polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS). A synergistic effect among hydrogen donor, in situ generated metallic Pd-0 species and acid site HCl in the reaction played a key role in DMF formation. Gratifyingly, the desirable yield of hydrodeoxygenation product DMF as high as 89.7% from HMF was attained at room temperature (298 K) in 0.5 h. Meanwhile, biomass derived sugars also could be converted into DMF in relative high efficiency via a one-pot reaction in the present system. A plausible pathway for the hydrodeoxygenation of HMF into DMF in the present system was also proposed. The study thus highlights a new perspective for a simple, green, and efficient hydrodeoxygenation of biomass derivatives under milder conditions, employing a readily available, inexpensive and practical catalytic system of PdCl2-PMHS-ethanol, but without any external hydrogen supplies and pre-reduction treatments.

AB The coalescence kinetics of oil-in-water emulsions in a wide range of properties and flow microfluidic conditions is quantified. The conditions were chosen in order to mimic situations found in industrial processes involving liquid-liquid dispersions. With that aim, a numerical scheme based on population balance equations is proposed, applied, and validated by comparison to microfluidic experiments reported in the literature. A coalescence efficiency model accounting for colloidal and hydrodynamic interactions, and interface mobility is incorporated using the Smoluchowski collision kernel. The latter assures the accurate estimation of the droplet size evolution which governs the interfacial area and rate of mass transfer. Besides, the combined effect of interfacial tension and oil viscosity on the coalescence kinetics is properly quantified with one single fitting parameter. From the kinetics, the estimated coalescence time increases as the shear rate and volume fraction of the dispersed phase diminish. The close agreement of our results with the experimental findings substantiates the accuracy and wider application of the methodology here described as a diagnostic tool beneficial to industrial process design and control.

AB A three dimensional transient model was developed to simulate the pyrolysis process of coal in fixed bed reactor. The model considered a number of aspects associated with coal pyrolysis such as the evaporation and condensation of physical water, the release of volatiles, secondary cracking of pyrolysis tar and the variation of porosity. Conductive, radiative and convective types of heat transfer were all taken into account in the model. The phase transformation of physical water was modeled using the Lee model (Lee, 1980) available in the commercial CFD software Fluent. The multiple independent parallel reaction (MIPR) model was applied to predict the generations of volatile products. The secondary cracking of tar was described using the model proposed by Wurzenberger et al. (2002). The model was implemented in Fluent and validated through modeling the pyrolysis process of low-rank sub-bituminous coal in four laboratory-scale and externally heated fixed-bed reactors with or without internals. The predicted temperature evolutions of coal charge were in all quantitative agreements with experimental results. And the influences of internals on the yield of tar were also successfully captured by the simulations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The discrete phase model (DPM) has been widely used in CFD simulations to track discrete particles or droplets in a continuum fluid filed. This powerful technique, however, may face tremendous difficulty in tracking droplets flying through chambers with significantly different sizes. In such cases, it becomes very challenging to develop effective mesh for the big and small chambers together with the transition zone that can ensure solution convergence within reasonable computational time. In this work, a systematic method is introduced to tackle this problem. This method allows simulation of different sized chambers separately to avoid the meshing difficulty. A unique coupling approach offers smooth transition of droplets from one chamber to the other with rigorous conservation of their mass, energy and momentum. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through the simulation of skim milk droplet drying in a mono-disperse droplet spray dryer (MDSD), where droplets must pass through a small dispersion chamber before entering the main big drying chamber. For the first time, droplet drying process from exiting nozzle to the arrival at the dryer outlet can be simulated. The new model can be used in the future to optimize the spray drying process.

AB In this work, a monolith reactor model was developed to study the effect of phase distribution on the performance of the monolith reactors by integrating phase distribution data from the experiments. To obtain the phase distribution at the reactions conditions, gamma ray computed tomography (CT) was used. Effect of gas density, surface tension of liquid and operating conditions on the phase distribution were studied using gamma-ray computed tomography. Experiments were conducted in Taylor flow regime. With the increase in gas density, uniformity increases. Surface tension has little effect on the distribution in the investigated conditions. Liquid with lower surface tension and gas with lower density has higher cross-sectional liquid saturation. Further, the monolith reactor model with uniform phase distribution and actual distribution were compared. It was found that at higher velocities both gives the same reactor performance irrespective of the maldistribution, however at low velocities, they differ significantly due to the maldistribution. If the maldistribution is present at both low and high velocities, catalyst utilization plays a major role, thus it is recommended to operate at higher velocities where catalyst utilization is high due to high mass transfer.

AB Exploiting a simple and effective strategy to build shell-tuned hollow nanomaterials with unchanged surface microstructure is a great challenge but important for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of V2O5 hollow microspheres, where the hierarchical shell thickness can be changed by controlling internal-diffusion rate of the core precursor. The fascinating nanostructures can guarantee the full contact with electrolyte with shortened ions diffusion path. Meantime, the self-created pores can effectively alleviate the volume change in the charge/discharge process. When evaluated as cathode materials, the V2O5 hollow microspheres can deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 287 and 140 mAh g(-1) at 1/3 C and 10 C, respectively with a good cycling stability. After inserting Li+, the corresponding Li3VO4/CNTs nanoparticles are obtained as anode materials, also exhibiting a high specific capacity of 200 mAh g(-1) even after 800 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1). An all-vanadium-based lithium-ion full battery (V2O5//Li3VO4/CNTs) is assembled, which gives a high specific capacity of 55 mAh g(-1) at 5000 mA g(-1) even after 1000 cycles based on the cathode material weight.

AB Electrostatic ignition has triggered significant fire/explosion incidents in liquid processing industries including chemical, oil/gas, food, pharmaceutical and transportation. In this work, the impact of gas-velocity and temperature on the electrostatic energy accumulation in a scrubber column was studied. An in-situ charge measurement apparatus combined with a particle scattering laser function was installed inside a pilot-scale column filled with water through which nitrogen was sparged; the formed aerosol particle size distribution, concentration, mass and charge were measured simultaneously. Response surface methodology was employed to construct a quadratic model correlating the electrostatic energy response with the gas velocity and column temperature. Four scenarios were considered and their capacity to provoke ignition was evaluated. Temperature was found affect the charged aerosol droplet size but also to facilitate the charge relaxation in the liquid phase. The faster the gas velocity the higher the electrostatic energy accumulation and the probability of ignition. In the presence of non-grounded conductors, the maximum electrostatic energy from spark discharge was found above the minimum ignition energy of some flammable chemicals and poses as significant fires or explosion risk. In contrast, if there is no ungrounded conductor, the corona discharge was found not sufficient for electrostatic ignition in the range of temperature and gas velocity in this study. To reduce the electrostatic hazards, it is recommended to remove ungrounded conductors within the column. And the gas flow should be maintained at minimum if ungrounded conductors are present.

AB We developed lyophobic magnetorheological suspensions with improved gravitational stability. The space-spanning particle network arising from lyophobic aggregation is responsible for this enhancement. The lyophobic effect in the presence of the magnetic field can be overcome by decreasing the number of lyophobic particles or through the addition of magnetic nanoparticles, leaving a considerable magnetorheological response in the sample. This work emphasizes the advantages of lyophobic force in the control of the sedimentation stability of magnetorheological suspensions without the need for anti-setting additives.

AB An original simplified mathematical model of the process of tert-butyl alcohol dehydration in a catalytic zone of the reactive distillation unit with the downward concurrent flow of liquid and vapor phases is developed. The system of heat and mass balance equations includes relationships that allow determining changes in temperature as well as gas and liquid compositions caused by a chemical reaction along the catalyst bed height. Results of calculation of the temperature profile along the catalyst bed height, carried out using the developed model, are in good agreement with data from our previous laboratory studies as well as with data obtained during trial operation of an industrial reactor.

AB Li diffusion efficiency reflects the kinetics of Li intercalation/de-intercalation in solid electrode materials and determines the rate performances of Li ion batteries. Traditional techniques including the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potential intermittent titration technique, potential relaxation technique, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, and cyclic voltammetry, could lead to significant disagreement on Li chemical diffusion coefficients due to the limited reliability of the parameters required for calculating Li diffusion coefficients. Based on the Nernst-Einstein equation, a double-battery system is proposed for the direct measurement of chemical diffusion coefficients of Li in solid electrodes. With the double-battery system, Li diffusion coefficients in the intercalation/deintercalation of graphite electrodes featured with phase-transition and double-phase regions, are measured efficiently, with consistent values in the range of 10(-10)-10(-9) cm(2)/s. The direct measurement then allows for the evaluation of the diffusion barrier associated with Li intercalation/de-intercalation in the electrodes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A numerical model for the contaminated interface is discussed, and then it is applied to investigate detailedly the interfacial surfactant concentration, the interfacial properties and the wake flow of a contaminated spherical bubble. For the present model, the surfactant molecules adsorbed on the bubble surface are assumed to be distributed over the concentration boundary layer adjacent to the bubble. The thickness of concentration boundary layer is obtained through the revised value from a theoretical formula. Then, the interfacial surfactant concentration is evaluated by coupling the transport equations of interfacial and bulk surfactant concentrations with the Navier-Stokes equations. The connection between the tangential stress and the interfacial surfactant concentration is set through the Marangoni stress and the state equation. The current results show that the present numerical model is reliable. The convention from the main flow, the Marangoni effect and the wake vortex determine the distribution of interfacial surfactant concentration on the bubble surface. The gradient of interfacial surfactant concentration along the bubble surface further affects the interfacial properties which react on the surrounding flow as feedbacks. The gradient of interfacial surfactant concentration at the front edge of the "contaminated" interface (FECI) is closely related to the location of FECI to the strongest convection position in the bulk around the bubble. The peak point on the curves of tangential stress and interfacial vorticity corresponds to the inflection point on the curve of interfacial surfactant concentration. The vortex size is affected by the positive pressure gradient at the bubble rear in bulk and the abrupt change of interfacial vorticity at FECI. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, the demand for durene has been increased as the raw material of polyimide. However, traditional synthesis methods of durene require a large number of steps with lower efficiency. In this study, a novel synthesis method of a bifunctional integrated catalyst had been utilized, in which the methanol synthesis catalyst Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) and the aromatization catalyst Co-Nb/HZSM-5 were combined, to synthesize durene from syngas in one step. Syngas was converted to methanol and dimethyl ether (DME) followed by the production of different aromatics with a high concentration of durene through the shape selectivity of zeolite. The optimal reaction conditions of 330 degrees C, 4 MPa, 200 h(-1), 3% Co loading, CZA/HZSM-5 = 3:2 and a unique pseudo-physical coating (PC) integrated method were applied to increase durene selectivity up to 39.71% in aromatics. Different techniques such as XRD, BET, XPS and NH3-TPD were employed to characterize different catalysts, and a variety of experiments were proceeded to compare different routes of methanol and FT synthesis. These results explain that the high selectivity of tetra-methylbenzene (tetra-MB) was due to the alkylation of trimethylbenzene (tri-MB) induced by methanol on HZSM-5 surface. This work demonstrated that the integrated catalyst could be advantageous for direct conversion of syngas to tri-MB and finally to the desired durene and it would open up the new avenues in future perspectives.

AB Current research is focused toward the development of a new approach based on efficient bioactive lipid nanocarriers (BLN) in order to obtain enhanced benefit to risk ratios of natural and synthetic actives. For this purpose, the bioactivities of several BLN (prepared with raspberry oil, Rso, and rice bran oil, Rbo) containing a natural extract (willow bark extract, Wbe) or a blend of Wbe and the synthetic anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin (Ind) have been comparatively analysed. BLN exhibited homogeneity regarding the particle size (diameters less than 140 nm), excellent physical stability (negative surface charge of -40 and -48 mV) and high encapsulation efficiency (89 to 91% for salicin from Wbe and 65 to 72.5% for Ind). The association of Wbe together with Ind co-loaded BLN resulted in a noticeable amplification of the antioxidant activity (the scavenging of free oxygen radicals exceeds 90%), a protective effect on L929 cells (low apoptosis values of 11.6 and 15.9%) and a significant ability to reduce the TNF-alpha and IL-6 inflammatory marker levels. The in vitro release, achieved on BLN-Wbe-Ind based-hydrogels, has revealed a gradual release of both kinds of actives. BLN may represent a valuable strategy for overcoming the side effects of synthetic drugs while treating inflammation-related skin disorders. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fundamental research on developing a facile, industrially viable approach for producing concentrated single-layered graphene oxide (GO) aqueous dispersions is crucial for applications in related industrial fields. In this innovative work, cross-flow membrane filtration is reported for the first time for preparing stable GO dispersions with concentrations controlled from 1 to 16 g.L-1. The flux behavior with different process conditions (membrane pore diameter, transmembrane pressure, and tangential velocity), the relevant hydraulic resistances, and fouling mechanism have been systematically studied for optimization of the process parameters. The physicochemical properties of GO products are characterized by various methods, and the results show that all the concentrated dispersions possess good fluidity, with hydrolysis of functional groups resulting in a pH decline, and no re-stacking or agglomeration of the GO sheets occurring during the concentration process. The concentrated GO dispersions, presenting distinctive liquid crystal phases, offer tremendous potential in the fabrication of highly ordered macroscopic structures as well as the development of novel graphene-based devices.

AB The role of aluminum in the structure of hydrotalcite-based sorbents was investigated with Al-27-NMR and XPS with respect to the chemisorption mechanism of different sorbate species, such as CO2, H2O and H2S, at elevated temperatures. Sorbent materials with different ratios of Al/Mg were studied in order to elucidate the influence of the material composition on the Al coordination. Two different tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Al species were detected. It was found that their quantitative appearance depends on the ratio of Al/Mg within the sorbent material. A higher Mg content leads to a higher distortion and to the formation of more tetrahedrally coordinated Al with a high chemical shift. Whereas CO2 and H2O adsorption does not seem to influence well-coordinated Al, as observed with NMR, chemisorption of H2S showed a clear interaction with Al leading to the formation of an additional tetrahedrally coordinated site with a high chemical shift. XPS showed that a reversible metal sulfate complex was formed on the sorbent, which was reversible upon exposure to H2O. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rapid magnetic resonance imaging is used to investigate the volume, shape and rise velocity of single isolated bubbles injected into incipiently fluidized beds as well as the particle velocity field surrounding these bubbles. The volume of gas injected and particle size are varied to investigate their effects on bubble behavior. Image processing is used to quantify data into plots which can be compared directly with predictions from analytical and numerical models. Results show that more injected gas leaks into the interstitial flow in beds of large particles than beds of small particles because of the higher permeability to gas flow. Bubbles develop from a taller shape with a large wake angle into a wider shape with a smaller wake angle as they develop from a spherical shape to a spherical cap shape as they rise. Bubble rise velocities for fully formed bubbles are consistent with correlations in the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol is promising for achieving the sustainable energy economy, but still has some problems, e. g. low methanol selectivity and high operation pressures (> 10 atm). Herein, we prepared a Pt/film hybrid with highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles, and combined Pt/film with In2O3 to form a Pt/film/In2O3 catalyst. By using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor, a CO2 conversion of 37.0% and a methanol selectivity of 62.6% are achieved in the hydrogenation of CO2 with H-2 on Pt/film/In2O3 at 1 atm and 30 degrees C. These are higher than those on Pt/In2O3 prepared by the conventional high-temperature H-2 reduction (24.9% and 36.5%) and commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (25.6% and 35.1%). The high-energy electrons of the DBD plasma trigger the CO2 hydrogenation at 1 atm and 30 degrees C. The higher Pt nanoparticles dispersion, film and In2O3 promote the adsorption of CO2 on Pt/film/In2O3, thus enhancing the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol. These results are helpful for efficient methanol production from CO2 hydrogenation under atmospheric pressure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The kinetics of stain removal from knitted cotton textiles during the washing process in a Front Loader Washing Machine (FLWM) has been investigated as a function of the ballast load, agitation, drum rotational speed and washing time, which result in different levels of mechanical action during the wash. The study was conducted using a set of stains comprising grease, enzymatic, particulate and coloured beverage type of soils that are representative of typical domestic washing loads. A mechanistic model has been developed to describe the stain removal process which takes into consideration the dual porosity of the textiles by allowing two different regions where the soil is located (inter-yarn and intra-yarn porosity). The location of the soil affects its exposure to the hydrodynamic forces and surfactant system resulting in a more challenging removal for the portion of the stain located in the inner area of the textiles. Good agreement between the experimental and predicted stain removal by the proposed mathematical model has been observed for the range of variables considered. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Gas holdup of water/nitrogen, water-phenol/nitrogen and water-phenol/air systems was successfully measured by a method based on the use of a differential pressure sensor installed on a bubble column reactor, in a wide domain of temperature (from 100 to 300 degrees C) and pressure (from 10 to 30 MPa). These experimental conditions are little or no explored in literature. Results show a predominant influence of the superficial gas velocity, the evaporation of the liquid phase, the ratio of the gas volume flowrate on the liquid volume flowrate and the phenol concentration. Pressure and chemical reaction have little effect on gas holdup. The temperature has an effect in the case of phenol solutions. The different correlations and parameters influence determined in this work are very helpful for the design of gas liquid contactors (for instance bubble column) at high pressure and high temperature.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are one of the biggest concerns in the ambient environment that have attracted a great number of studies related to its remediation. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)-based photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is a promising technology in controlling VOCs. CeO2 is found to be a promising catalyst for the VUV-PCO technology possessing catalytic capacities in both the photocatalysis and ozonation processes. In this study, three typical kinds of pure CeO2 with various nanostructures were synthesized and creatively applied for VUV-photocatalytic oxidation of toluene. Material characterizations, including BET, SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, XPS, H-2-TPR and DRS, were conducted to characterize different CeO2 samples. Results indicated that synthetic CeO2 samples have a much more remarkable enhancement in degrading toluene compared to commercial ones. Higher COx generation and mineralization rates were obtained with the use of all the synthetic CeO2 samples. Compared to commercial CeO2, the synthetic samples have much better capacity towards removing ozone and the best activity in ozone decomposition was observed in CeO2 Nanorods catalysts. Both the effects of photocatalysis and catalytic ozonation exist in all the CeO2 catalysts. The amount of Ce3+ plays a critical role in both the catalytic activity of photocatalysis and ozonation that higher ratio of Ce3+ leads to better performance in toluene removal. The differences in photocatalytic activity were further explained by the results of electrochemical behaviors of different CeO2 samples which showed varying responses to UV irradiation.

AB Accurate prediction of bubble diameter is crucial for the proper design, optimization, and scale-up of gas-liquid apparatuses. Bubble formation at submerged multiple orifices in a gas-liquid apparatus under industrial conditions is systematically investigated in this work. It is found that the bubble diameter firstly increases and then approaches to a relatively constant value in the low viscous liquid when increasing the orifice superficial gas velocity. Parametric studies demonstrate that large orifice diameter and high liquid viscosity lead to larger bubble diameter, and the inflection point in the curve of bubble diameter versus orifice superficial gas velocity is also affected. With surfactant added in solutions, the bubble diameter decreases markedly. Based on the experimental data, a semi-empirical correlation for predicting the bubble diameter is proposed using nonlinear least square optimization. The new correlation, containing the influence of orifice diameter, orifice superficial gas velocity and liquid properties on the bubble diameter, is further validated by comparing prediction results with experimental data over a wide range of operating conditions and working systems from the literature. Therefore, it is thought useful for the industrial design of gas-liquid apparatus. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Micro-reactors based on slug flow are among the most promising developments for improving the efficiencies of chemical reactions and unit operations in chemical engineering. Quantitative understanding of the local and global fluid dynamics and their effects on fluid mixing is required for designing effective slug flow micro-reactors. This paper proposes a new method for quantitative two-dimensional assessment of fluid mixing in slug flow. Pixel-wise calculation of local entropy inside a slug is discussed. The proposed method is based on two-phase simulation using the volume of fraction (VOF) algorithm and is thus applicable to the flow pattern in arbitrary wall-shaped micro-reactors. The method consists of three steps. (1) Flow analysis using two-phase VOF algorithm: A series of two-dimensional velocity fields inside the slug along time is obtained for a certain duration. (2) Backward particle tracking from the target image to the initial image: The slug in the initial image is divided into small regions, and each region is assigned a different label. Accumulation of backward particle tracking results reveals a two-dimensional distribution of labels in the target image. (3) Pixel-wise calculation of entropy on the obtained distribution of labels: The resulting image is a quantitative two-dimensional mixing pattern inside the slug. The proposed method was applied to three types of microchannels with different bumps on the walls. The results could quantitatively distinguish the differences in fluid mixing capability among the systems. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A CaO-based sorbent synthesized using the Pechini method is shown to have improved stability and cyclability over commercial calcium carbonates and other Ca-based sorbents for thermochemical energy storage and other chemical looping processes under N-2 and a 100%-CO2 atmosphere. The improved performance is ascribed to the greater surface area and smaller grain and particle sizes of the synthesized material. A modified isoconversional approach (the Friedman method) was used to model the kinetics of the decomposition and carbonation reaction under different atmospheres. The model accounts for the dependence of the reaction rate on equilibrium pressure under different atmospheres, including a CO2 atmosphere similar to reactor conditions. For calcination, values of energy of 164 kJ mol(-1) (under N-2) and 307 kJ mol(-1) (under CO2) were found for the calcination of Pechini-synthesized CaCO3. For the carbonation of the synthesized CaO, approximate values of 200 kJ mol(-1) (25% v/v CO2) and 450 kJ mol(-1) (100% CO2) were obtained for the activation energies of the chemical reaction regions. Further research into Pechini-synthesized Ca-based sorbents with supports will be carried out to further improve energy storage density and cyclic stability of sorbents.

AB The formation process of alternating droplets at the T-junction with a cross-sectional area of 400 mu m x 400 mu m was investigated using a high-speed camera. The alternating droplets were consisted of glycerol aqueous solution and ferrofluid droplets. Two formation types of alternating droplets were observed: normal formation and the upstream droplet squeezing formation. The existence of the magnetic field delayed the transition from the normal farmation to the upstream droplet squeezing formation. The effects of two-phase flow rate and magnetic flux density on the dynamics of the tip and the neck of the ferrofluid and the formation period were studied. The results show that the neck evolution of ferrofluid could be divided into the expansion stage and pinch-off stage. The expansion stage was dominated by the flow of ferrofluid, and the pinch-off stage was insensitive to fluid flow and was a self-similar process. The length of the tip of ferrofluid increases almost linearly with time during the pinch-off stage, and the increasing rate rose with the flow rates. The formation period of the droplets reduces as the fluid flow rate increases. When the formation type is normal formation, the existence of the magnetic field shortens the formation period. When the formation type is the upstream droplet squeezing regime, the existence of the magnetic field prolongs the formation period. This paper provides a new method for the generation of alternating droplets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bubbling fluidized beds with binary particle mixture have broad industrial applications. The difference in particle size/density leads to segregation phenomenon thus should be taken into account in modeling. In this work, we propose a binary EMMS-bubbling drag model by considering such difference and formation of bubbles which are associated with solid segregation. The model is validated through simulation of two fluidized beds with different binary particle mixtures. The new drag model is found to enable capturing the pronounced movement of bubbles, thus well predicts the segregation behavior, while using conventional drag leads to over-mixing of different particles.

AB The heterogeneity of rocks represents a challenge for interpreting and using outcomes from multiphase-flow experiments carried out on laboratory samples. While the capillary pressure-saturation function, p(c)(S), is known to vary spatially and cause local saturation development during immiscible displacements, its variation remains difficult to measure. This is particularly challenging for rocks with complex fabrics, such as carbonates. Here, we present a workflow for the dynamic measurement of core-and subcore-scale drainage pcoS+ curves in heterogeneous porous media. Multi-rate, two-phase core-flooding tests are conducted on three carbonate rocks with direct observations of local saturation data. The interpretation of the experiments is done by fitting the parameters of the p(c)(S) curve, while describing both steady-state saturation and pressure profiles with a detailed one-dimensional model that accounts for the variation of subcore-scale properties in the direction of displacement. Workflow validation is achieved by means of synthetic data, thereby demonstrating the uniqueness of the solution of the resulting multi-objective optimisation problem. The model reproduces accurately experimental data on the three rocks and enables computing the effective core-scale p(c)(S) curve in the limit of zero velocity, as it would be expected during a porous-plate experiment. The output of the proposed technique is however much richer and includes the relative p(c)(S) curve that is universal and independent of the specific pattern of heterogeneity, in addition to a set of scaling factors. The latter describe the distribution of the p(c)(S) curves at the subcore-scale due to heterogeneity and form the statistical basis needed for upscaling studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the present study, the experimental investigation and performance evaluation of a newly developed direct type ammonia fuel cell stack are performed. A solid anion exchange membrane electrolyte is also utilized. The performances of a single-cell and a 5-cell stack are investigated through thermodynamic efficiencies. The open circuit voltages for a single cell and 5-cell stack are obtained as 280 +/- 8 mV and 1249 +/- 37.5 mV respectively. Furthermore, the peak power densities are found as 6.4 +/- 0.2 W m(-2) and 13.4 +/- 0.4W m(-2) for a single-cell and a 5-cell stack respectively. Moreover, the effects of varying humidifier temperatures on their efficiencies are studied, and hence increasing humidifier temperatures are found to provide higher efficiencies. Both energetic and exergetic efficiencies at the peak power density are determined to be 52.4 +/- 1.6% and 49.3 +/- 1.6% respectively under the ambient conditions considered. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Additive manufacturing could be used to facilitate the rapid fabrication and testing of small-scale fluidized beds for use in screening applications, such as adsorbent screening for carbon capture. In this work, experiments were performed in order to map the different flow regimes produced in small-scale (D-h = 3-15 mm) gas-solid fluidized beds that were fabricated using additive manufacturing using the stereolithography approach. Here, the effects of bed hydraulic diameter (D-h), static particle height (H-s), and particle type/size (D-p and rho(p)) were considered. Pressure drop data and high speed camera images were used to develop simple flow regime maps for these printed beds showing the operating windows for packed bed, bubbling, slugging and turbulence applicable to a wide range of bed size to particle diameter ratios (D-h/D-p = 20-200) and gas velocities (U-g = 1-400 mm/s) in both '2D' and '3D' bed aspect ratios. Fast Fourier transforms of the pressure drop signals were also used to study the evolution of bubbling/slugging behaviour as the gas velocity was increased by creating 2D colour maps of the frequency spectra. These allowed a new quantitative method to be proposed for the identification of slugging-the point where the dominant frequency in the power spectrum becomes constant as the gas velocity increases. It is concluded in this study that the rougher surfaces generated by additive manufacturing do not influence the fluidization characteristics nor modify the wall effects of small-scale beds. Macro-scale fluidization could also be achieved at smaller D-h/D-p ratios in these 3D printed beds compared to more conventional Plexiglas beds (D-h/D-p = 75 compared to D-h/D-p = 300).

AB Cyclone separators are widely used for separation of solids or droplets from gases or liquid fluids. They represent an elegant and robust separation technology involving low capital and maintenance costs. It is therefore interesting, to extend cyclone technology to new applications, particularly in the oil and gas industry where separation duties are becoming ever more demanding and diverse, and separation processes are moving to more remote installations, such as sub-sea or even down-hole installations. The objective of this paper is to elucidate the working of hydrocyclones including ones acting on liquids of elevated viscosity using state-of-the-art experimental and analysis techniques, namely positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with large-eddy simulation of turbulence effects. The results show a number of interesting and anomalous features of the liquid and particle flow, such as unexpected excursions of particles to the inner vortex and the effect of the vortex end on the particle flow. It is shown that it is possible to determine the axis of the hydrocyclone very precisely by a minimization technique and thus convert the output from the tracking algorithm in Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates with the cyclone as axis. This throws additional light on the results. Tracks of different particles, some of which are eventually captured and some which are lost, are shown both in 3-D Cartesian and 2-D cylindrical coordinates and the effects of the fluid and particle properties are discussed.

AB The residence time distribution (RTD) of particles in a gas-solid dense fluidized bed with a continuous solid flow operation and baffles needs much more focus for the purpose of the wide industrial applications. The available models of solid RTD are not adequate in this case due to the additional convective diffusion induced by the cross-flow of the solid feeding and the complex geometry caused by the baffles. To address this problem, this work applied a two-phase Eulerian-Eulerian model combined with the species transport equation to predict solid RTD in a dense fluidized bed. The effects of the continuous solid feeding and baffles were considered. The solid dispersion coefficient Ds in the species transport equation was calculated by an analytical solution from kinetic theory of granular flow. Ds only needs the value at a molecular level due to the fact that the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is able to reproduce the RTD procedure exactly same as the practical experiments. To validate the established CFD model, a series of 3D lab-scale cold flow experiments were conducted in the free and baffled beds for the bed material with various severe non-spherical shapes. The measurement included the solid hydrodynamic characteristics at the outlet of the outflow pipe and solid RTD of the system. The reasonable agreement between the CFD prediction and experimental data demonstrated the good performance of the CFD model. 1D plug flow with dispersion model and the tanks-in-series model were further used to fit the calculated RTD curves. The estimated lateral dispersion coefficient of solids locates in a rational range compared with the data collected extensively from the literature. The results showed that the lateral dispersion coefficient of solids decreases when the baffles are installed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current efficiency and quality of deposited copper are important parameters in copper electrowinning industries. The effects of imposing an external magnetic field, Fe3+ and Cu2+ mass concentrations and electrical current density on the current efficiency, the thickness of the cathodic copper sheet and its morphology in copper electrowinning process were studied at different experimental operating conditions in a cuboid cell. A full factorial design of experiment is applied here to relate current efficiency and the standard deviation (STDEV) of the thickness with and without magnetic field, Fe3+ concentration (2.5 and 3.5 g/L), Cu2+ concentration (35 and 40 g/L) and electrical current density (150 and 220 A/m(2)) with constant acid concentration of 175 g/L at temperature of 40 degrees C for a synthetic electrolyte. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) is applied in studying the surface morphology of the deposited cathodic copper in all tests. The obtained results indicated that the presence of the magnetic field and increasing Fe3+ concentration could decrease the current efficiency up to 17 and 7%, respectively. While increasing Cu2+ concentration and electrical current density increased the current efficiency. Presence of magnetic field, increasing Fe3+ concentration and electrical current density increased the thickness uniformity of copper sheets. Investigation of SEM surface images revealed variations in these main parameters had different effects on deposited cathodic copper morphology. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phase change solvents are receiving increased attention in the effort to significantly reduce regeneration energy requirements in post combustion CO2 capture processes with chemical absorption. In this study, the phase behavior of various phase change, aqueous amine solutions, was experimentally investigated. A new experimental apparatus was developed and evaluated by determining the CO2 solubility in aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions at 40, 60 and 80 degrees C. Subsequently, new experimental data were obtained for aqueous solutions containing N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCA), methylcyclohexylamine (MCA) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1 -propanol (AMP) at 40, 60 and 90 degrees C that exhibit phase change behavior. It was observed that the investigated solutions present vapor - liquid equilibrium (VLE) at 40 degrees C and vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium (VLLE) at 60 and 90 degrees C for CO2 partial pressures up to approximately 70 kPa. In addition, screening experiments were performed using sulfolane, which has been previously used for gas sweeting applications, instead of AMP in the DMCA-MCA mixture. However, such system presents relatively low CO2 solubility, compared to the aforementioned (DMCA-MCA-AMP) system and aqueous MEA solutions. Finally, additional screening experiments were performed for two aqueous DMCA - 3-methylaminopropylamine (MAPA) amine solutions at different concentrations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Slowly varying process variations represented by slow features, which reflect the inherent dynamics of chemical processes, are revealed to be advantageous for quality prediction. However, if slow features are extracted from process variables as predictors without the supervision of quality indices, some obvious disadvantages are observed: (1) low quality interpretation and redundant slow features since quality information is not considered for feature extraction; (2) a lack of analysis to investigate the relationship between slow features and quality interpretation, especially for different types of quality indices. To solve the above-mentioned problems, a new soft-sensor algorithm, quality-relevant slow feature regression (QSFR), is proposed in the present work. It defines a new objective function by concurrent consideration of slowness and quality interpretation, yielding more meaningful features as predictors to interpret quality index. On the basis of this, a critical feature selection strategy is proposed based on quality interpretation to determine the retained features for regression. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the properties of retained features is provided to reveal the hidden mechanism and how the slow time-varying process variations influence the quality interpretation. This algorithm can extract more powerful features as predictors and enhance understanding of inherent nature of slow features. Finally, the feasibility and performance of the proposed method are well illustrated for a well-known benchmark process and a real chemical process. The developed QSFR algorithm performs better than traditional slow feature regression method, in which the values of RMSE of three specific quality indices have been reduced by 8.87%, 16.60%, and 3.40%, respectively.

AB In this paper, efforts are made to improve the spatial resolution of electrical tomography imaging (ETI), which has succeeded in many fields in the past decades as an advanced process tomography technique. However, its spatial resolution is usually too low to be efficiently used in applications due to the inaccurate sensitivity coefficient. Most of the existing ETI algorithms use the linear components of sensitivity coefficient owing to easy implementation and comprehensive operation. However, the neglected nonlinear parts may contain more useful information. In this paper, we characterized the nonlinear second-order sensitivity coefficient, analyzed its major characteristics, and finally proposed a novel ETI model, which was helpful for improving the spatial resolution of the ETI process. Experimental results showed that this model had higher spatial resolutions than the traditional models that only used linear sensitivity coefficients. The research in this paper can provide reference for the ETI-related applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gas residence time distribution (RTD) is an effective and convenient indicator for evaluating the performance of complex multiphase chemical reactors including ironmaking blast furnaces (BFs). However, in the open literature, there lacks the systematic RTD research for BFs. In this study, an integrated mathematical model is developed for describing the gas RTD of a BF. The model combines a steady multi-fluid model for describing the in-furnace state of flow and thermo-chemical behavior of gas-solid-liquid phases and a transient model for describing the dynamic behavior of tracer materials. The results show that the gas flow field inside the BF is quite complex, resulting from many factors such as furnace geometry and coupled thermo-chemical behaviors of other phases. The tail of gas RTD curve resulted from the lagging phenomenon of tracer flow inside BFs, is captured. The gas RTD is discussed by using mean residence time, dispersion of molecules distribution, cumulative distribution function and residence time intensity function. Under the given BF conditions, mean residence time and space time of gas fluids are predicted as 13.5 s and 16.3 s, respectively. The existence of stagnant flow in the BF can be both derived and directly identified. Moreover, it is indicated the gas flow patterns in the BF are composed of piston-type flow, stagnant flow and limited mixing flow. This study provides a cost-effective tool for better understanding BF gas flow dynamics and optimizing BF operations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Isolated single-atom Pd sites in intermetallic structures have the higher stability and unique catalytic properties. This study was designed to investigate the properties of isolated single-atom Pd sites in PdIn intermetallic toward formic acid oxidation compared to Pd3In and the pure Pd using density functional theory calculation. Unexpectedly, CO adsorption over PdIn catalyst is significantly lower than those over Pd3In and the pure Pd catalysts, an indication that CO poisoning is remarkably reduced on PdIn catalysts compared to the Pd3In and pure Pd catalysts. More importantly, PdIn catalyst with isolated single-atom Pd sites exhibits higher selectivity for formic acid oxidation to CO2 and inhibits CO formation, whereas Pd3In catalyst with Pd trimer presents better selectivity for formic acid oxidation to CO, which poisons Pd-based catalyst. Moreover, compared to the pure Pd catalyst, PdIn catalyst with isolated single-atom Pd sites not only has the higher activity and stability but also maximize atomic efficiency for noble metal Pd to reduce the catalyst cost. It is expected that the method applied in this research is beneficial to for the design and evaluation of intermetallic catalysts in clean energy technology development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A mathematical model for the synthesis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) from finely dispersed solid sodium hydride (NaH) and dissolved trimethyl borate (B(OH)(3)) in inert mineral oil was developed. The model is based on a plausible reaction mechanism of dissolved and adsorbed trimethyl borate on the surface of sodium hydride, where the reaction is presumed to take place. The surface reaction between sodium hydride and trimethyl borate leads to the formation of main (NaBH4) and side products (methoxy borohydrides), which was verified by chemical analysis of sodium borohydride and methanol in the water extract of the oil phase. Extensive kinetic experiments in a laboratory-scale isothermal and isobaric slurry reactor enabled a detailed kinetic analysis of the data, including the derivation of a mathematical model for the formation of sodium borohydride in a semibatch slurry reactor. The kinetic model was verified with experimental information and can be used as an element for process design. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is challenging to achieve non-stop flow of a liquid-solid suspension through small channels as it eventually leads to clogging. This paper presents a quantitative comparison of four different techniques for enhancement of solid handling processes in microchannels of two different diameters. These techniques include dosing of the inert gas phase, dosing of the inert and immiscible liquid phase, and changing the wall wettability and multi-point injection, which, in principle, individually follow different mechanisms to delay clogging. An antisolvent based method for precipitation of salt was used to generate solid particles during flow. Clogging time at various flow rates from all the methods was measured and analysed. Irrespective of the method of delaying clogging, the scaling law of clogging time as a function of residence time was seen to remain unchanged. Among these methods, dosing of an inert, immiscible liquid has been identified as the most effective and robust method to delay clogging while enhancing transport of particles in segmented flow.

AB This study aimed to employ population balance Monte Carlo (PBMC) method to guide the tailor-making of core-shell microarchitecture of particles in aqueous suspensions. Larger micro-Al2O3 (mu m-Al2O3) particles were coated with smaller nano-TiO2 (nm-TiO2) particles by self-assembly technique, under the consideration of complex colloidal particle dynamics. For a desired core-shell structure, hetero-aggregation (TiO2-Al2O3) with a higher priority than homo-aggregation (Al2O3-Al2O3, TiO2-TiO2) can be achieved by adjusting Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) forces through the process parameters pH and ionic strength (IS). To simulate such multicomponent aggregation, PBMC was adopted to directly track the competition of various aggregations and the change of particle variables, based on Brownian motion and extended-DLVO theory. For better understanding the competition kinetics, attachment efficiency was calculated to reveal quantitatively the combined effect of van der Waals attraction, electric double layer repulsion/attraction, and hydration repulsion. A charge balance model was developed to view the change of particle surface electrostatic potential issued from the aggregation of various charged particles. A dynamic light scattering measurement was conducted to validate the PBMC simulation. This PBM method was implemented to explore the effects of pH and IS, then to obtain the optimized coverage efficiency of the final core-shell composite particles. These findings look promising for understanding inherent particle dynamics and rationalizing self-assembly process of core-shell microarchitectures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrate dissociation poses a significant problem during drilling operations in hydrate-bearing sediments. The drilling fluid is in direct contact with hydrates, and understanding its inhibitory effect on hydrate dissociation is important for stabilizing hydrates during drilling operations. In this work, an apparatus was designed for investigating hydrate dissociation in drilling fluids, and the effects of thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors (THIs), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), and soybean lecithin on hydrate dissociation were studied. The inhibitory effect of a water-based drilling fluid in the presence of the potential hydrate dissociation inhibitors was also studied. An unexpected inhibitory effect occurred with ethylene glycol (EG) at concentrations below 10 wt%, resulting from a range of factors including the dissociation driving force, and mass and heat transfers in the EG solution. PVP and lecithin reduced the hydrate dissociation rate and increased the time required for complete dissociation of hydrates. These can, therefore, be used in waterbased drilling fluids to inhibit hydrate dissociation. A combination of 0.1 wt% PVP and 0.5 wt% lecithin was selected as an optimal hydrate dissociation inhibitor, considering its inhibitory effect and compatibility with the drilling fluid. Using EG at a concentration below 10 wt% as a THI instead of NaCl can also help inhibit hydrate dissociation. The findings of this work provide a basis for the development and design of drilling fluids for drilling in hydrate-bearing sediments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study deals with the 'vanadium (IV) sulfate' and 'vanadium (V) pentoxide' dissolution processes in 3 M H2SO4 aqueous media. Several measurements of the concentration of dissolved VO(2)(+)and VO2+ were achieved in the range of 0-40 degrees C, and allowed to understand the limitations of the dissolution process ('endothermic' - mass transport for VOSO4 and 'exothermic' - reaction with the proton for V2O5). In addition, simple models were proposed (diffusion/accumulation for VOSO4 and kinetic rate for V2O5) and their resolution leads to theoretical kinetic equations describing the temporal evolution of these concentrations with satisfactory agreement with the experimental curves. Solubility's data and their temperature dependence were determined for both vanadium compounds involved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The gas-liquid flow characteristics in an air-water system were studied using electrical resistance tomography (ERT) in a pressurized gas-liquid bubble column with an inner diameter of 0.30 m and a height of 6.60 m. The effects of the superficial gas velocity and system pressure on the radial gas holdup were investigated under superficial gas velocities (0.120-0.312 m/s) and system pressures (0.5-2.0 MPa). Two-fluid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the bubble column in two- and three-dimensions, and the drag force, transverse lift force, turbulent dispersion force, and wall lubrication force were introduced for model correction. Based on the determination of the transverse lift force, turbulent diffusion force, and wall lubrication force in previous works of our group, three different of drag model schemes were proposed in this study. In the Model A, based on Roghair's drag model, a density correction and the gas holdup of large and small bubbles were introduced to correct the model; in the Model B, while the gas holdup of large bubbles was greater than 0.08, the influence of small bubbles was ignored. The small bubbles and liquid were integrated into a single phase (the dense phase), while the large bubbles were the dilute phase; in the Model C, an energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) concept based on the double bubble size model was used, and relationship between the drag coefficient and the bubble diameter were introduced to modify the models. Moreover, through optimizing adjustment of the model parameter, the simulation results with the three models were found to be consistent with the experimental results obtained from ERT technique. These results may facilitate improvements in the design and scale-up of bubble columns with high-pressure and high superficial gas velocities, as well as the significance of further research.

   sorbent sintering during initial cycles
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE

DT Article
ID CO2 CAPTURE; CAPACITY; SERIES
AB A new model describing the evolution of sorptive and textural properties of a CaO-based sorbent during repetitive sorption/regeneration cycles has been developed. The proposed model considers the morphology of nascent monodisperse CaO and the sintering of sorbent grains upon the assumption of the surface mass-transfer mechanism. In addition, the obtained model allows predicting the change in the textural properties of the sorbent (e.g. the values of specific surface area and mean pore size) during the sorption/regeneration cycles. The obtained results show that the model of surface sintering is well applicable to the description of the decay of the sorbent sorption capacity in initial several cycles, while the previously developed model of the volume sintering provides good prediction of this decay only after several cycles. It can be assumed that during the cycling, the sintering of the sorbent switches from the surface to the volume regime. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Integrated control and process design is considered for a power plant to obtain improved load changes in output electrical power (MWe). Fast load transitions are increasingly needed in conventional power plants, which calls for a deeper integration between the boiler and its control system. An integrated design methodology is applied to an industrial boiler steam path in this paper; no past reports of such an application exist in the literature. The methodology utilizes dynamic optimization together with performance relative gain array and closed-loop disturbance gain controllability analysis. The aim is to optimize the boiler steam storage distribution, the turbine valve operation, and the electrical power and main steam pressure controllers during different MWe ramp reference trajectories. The methodology was successful in defining closed-loop designs with excellent MWe setpoint tracking, small steam pressure disturbances and minimal steam throttling. The results also highlighted the challenges related to integrated design in power plants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rising single air bubbles were investigated in aqueous solutions of hexadecylamine (HDA) and methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) as surface active agents at varying concentrations at a constant gas flow rate. Shadowgraphy was applied to determine main bubble characteristics, such as equivalent diameter, morphology, and rising velocity. From these characteristics, critical parameters like the concentration at the minimum bubble velocity were derived. Simultaneous application of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) provided information about hydrodynamic parameters, e.g. the induced liquid velocities and vortex shedding.
   From surface tension measurements, the concentration of adsorbed species on the interface and packing densities of HDA and MIBC on the bubble surface could be calculated. HDA exhibited a better adsorption and a higher packing density on the bubble surface compared to MIBC due to the ionic character and the straight hydrocarbon chain. The bubble characteristics were therefore more strongly affected by HDA than by MIBC.
   Combining the Shadowgraphy and PIV results it was found that the mean liquid velocity as well as the amount of induced turbulent kinetic energy increased with increasing concentration of surfactants in the solutions, while the investigated bubble characteristics such as equivalent diameter and rising velocity decreased. The increase in mean liquid velocity and induced turbulent kinetic energy could be correlated with the oscillating frequency of the bubble trajectory, which also increased with increasing surfactant concentration. The vortex shedding process could be visualised using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) revealing the micro-process of energy cascading. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effect of pore geometry on nanoconfined gas transport capacity has not been clearly revealed. Elliptical cross-section can vary from circular to slit-like shape by adjusting the aspect ratio (AR), which covers a wide range of pore shapes and shares more research value over that of regular cross-section. In this paper, a novel analytical model for gas transport in elliptical nanopores is established based on weighted superposition of continuum flow and Knudsen diffusion, which possesses more solidified theoretical background than existed models for elliptical nanopores. Results show that contribution of Knudsen diffusion will increase with the increase of AR at a certain pore scale. For a certain pressure point, the contribution of continuum flow mechanism within large pore scale will be greater than that within small pore scale. The discrepancy of simplifying elliptical cross-section as circle is about 90% in continuum flow, 50% in slip flow and 10% in transition flow as well as Knudsen diffusion. The proposed model can advance current understanding of gas transport characteristics through realistic shale matrix. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ce0.8SM0.2O1.9-SM0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (SDC-SSF) dual-phase ceramic membranes with sandwich-structure were fabricated by chemical etching method. By this method, SSF perovskite particles was etched from both sides of SDC-SSF dual phase membrane, and a SDC/SDC-SSF/SDC three-layer membrane with sandwich structure could be obtained. Crystal phase, microstructure and elemental distribution of SDC-SSF sandwich-structured membranes were investigated. XRD and SEM-EDS results demonstrate that SDC fluorite particles can be well reserved to form porous supports after leaching out SSF perovskite particles and a SDC-SSF dense functional layer was firmly sandwiched between two SDC porous supports, in which common shrinkage mismatch between thin film and porous support can be readily avoided. Thickness of SDC-SSF dense layer can be precisely controlled by changing the etching time. Oxygen permeation tests reveal that our SDC-SSF membranes exhibit an obviously improved oxygen permeation flux. Especially while cobalt-based catalysts were introduced into SDC porous supports, its oxygen flux could be further increase up to 0.95 ml.min(-1).cm(-2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water-lean absorbents have potential applications for energy-efficient CO2 capture. In this work, the chemical kinetics of the reaction between carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and potassium prolinate (ProK) in ethanol, ethylene glycol and water solvents was measured in a stirred cell reactor with a stable gas-liquid interface at temperatures from 275.2 to 285.2 K and ProK molar concentrations up to 2.0 M. The experiments were performed under the pseudo-first-order regime to determine the overall kinetic rate constant (k(ov)) using two-film theory. The results showed that the reaction rates in each polar solvent increase considerably as the increasing ProK concentrations and temperatures. The reaction order was found to be in the range of 1.4-2.0 with respect to ProK concentration, depending on the solvents used. The kinetic results for the reaction in ethanol were also interpreted based on zwitterion mechanism and termolecular mechanism. The calculated from the two proposed models match well with the experimental data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gravitational settling of solid particles into a fractal-shaped channel was investigated experimentally and theoretically. Previous studies have reported that the settling behavior of particles in liquid-filled channels depends strongly on particle properties and suspension conditions. At small particle size and high concentration, particles settle collectively like an immiscible fluid with respect to the surrounding one. In this study, we examined the gravitational dispersion behavior of solid particles in a three-dimensional fractal-shaped channel under various collective conditions. The experimental results showed that the settling behavior varies with the collectivity of suspended particles. In the case of high collectivity conditions, settling velocity is enhanced by a density-driven instability, which depends not only on the physical properties of the particles and fluid but also on channel geometry. We developed a model of temporal change in the volumetric occupancy ratio of the suspended particles region. This model describes the invasion of particles into a fractal channel. Our model comprises only the fractal characteristics of the channel, such as a homothetic ratio and a bifurcation number. Consequently, This model could provide a rough prediction of the gravity-induced invasion behavior of particles into any fractal-shaped channel. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Firstly, negatively charged silk fibroin (SF) was cationically modified by covalent linkage with polyethylene glycol diamine (NH2-PEG-NH2). The surface charge of cationic SF film changed from negative to positive when SF:NH 2 -PEG-NH2 = 100:0.5, and enhanced with increasing NH2-PEG-NH2. Zeta potential was maximal and stable when SF:NH2-PEG-NH2 = 100:5. NH2-PEG-NH2 induced SF films to adopt a stable crystalline structure. After cationisation, SF films were loaded with hirudin (SF-PEG-HIR film) by non covalent linkage. The effective load capacity of hirudin on the surface of cationic SF films was highest (>40 U/cm(2)) when SF: NH2-PEG-NH2 = 100:10. The ability of SF-PEG-HIR films to inhibit thrombin activity improved with increasing hirudin content while thrombin activity was reduced significantly (A(405) decreased from 0.563 to 0.03) when the hirudin loading was 40 U/cm(2). Likewise, thrombin activity in fresh plasma was reduced significantly (A(405) decreased from 0.102 to 0.067). Release dynamics showed that thrombin activity decreased linearly within 2 h, then more slowly thereafter. SF-PEG-HIR films markedly prolonged the activated partial thrombin time and significantly inhibited adhesion of platelets. Thus hirudin can be stably loaded on cationic SF films via electrostatic interaction, maintaining high thrombin inhibition activity, and significantly improving the anticoagulant properties of SF films.

AB In this work, a continuum theory for cohesive particles developed recently (Kellogg et al., 2017) is applied to lightly-cohesive particles in an unbounded, gas-solid riser. The novelty of this recent theory is its fundamental incorporation of the effects of the granular temperature (i.e., continuum measure of impact velocity) and the material and cohesion properties on the rates of aggregation and breakage of agglomerates. Here, we extend this theory to multiphase systems and place particular emphasis on its ability to predict entrainment rate, as past empirical correlations vary by orders of magnitude when applied to the same system (Chew et al., 2015). Specifically, continuum predictions of entrainment rates and agglomer- ate fraction are compared with Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of lightly-cohesive particles in a gas-solid flow. The agreement obtained for these quantities provides preliminary validation for the use of the continuum theory for cohesive particles in gas-solid flows. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this note, an extension of the design of asymptotic observers is proposed for the thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal continuous stirred tank reactor (involving n(c) active chemical species with n(r) independent reactions) that has incomplete state information. The two well-known constraints for the implementations of the asymptotic observer are the process operating conditions and the availability of temperature measurement together with (n(r) - 1) concentration measurements. However, even though the process operating conditions are justified, the requirement of having good estimation performances and high accuracy of (n(c) - n(r) + 1) state estimates may only be guaranteed if a so-called feasibility condition of the observer is fulfilled. This feasibility condition is formulated via the full rank constraint of a structural matrix, which is related to the stoichiometric coefficient matrix. A sufficient condition for the fulfilment of the full rank constraint shows that the process estimation selection is not made arbitrarily. Interestingly, as the designed observer is based on thermodynamic information only and does not require knowledge of reaction kinetics, the solution proposed to the feasibility condition has a clear physical meaning. Numerical simulations considered for Van de Vusse reaction system illustrate the application of the theoretical results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membranes with fast CO2 transport pathways have attracted intense attention due to their outstanding CO2 permeability, showing potential for industrial application. Regulating the spatial distribution of CO2 philic groups in polymer-based membranes is expected to be a promising strategy to achieve the fast CO2 transport pathways. In membrane matrix, the interconnected network of concentrated domains of CO2 facilitated transport groups provides membranes with specific CO2 transport pathways and finally leads to their high separation performance. In this study, a novel kind of polyelectrolyte membrane, quaternary ammonium polysulfone with interconnected ionic clusters, is prepared to enhance the CO2 permeability. The hydrophilic quaternary ammonium groups tend to aggregate spontaneously to create ionic clusters. Furthermore, under humidified conditions, these ionic clusters are connected by water to form an ionic cluster network in the membrane matrix. The ionic cluster network plays the crucial role in accelerating the selective transport for CO2 molecules over CH4 by the reversible interaction between CO2 and ion pairs. By tuning the quaternization degree of polysulfone, a series of polyelectrolyte membranes with different size of ionic clusters were developed. Membranes with hydrated ionic clusters (5-9 nm) show dramatic enhancement in CO2 separation performance, especially in CO2 permeability. The as-prepared quaternary ammonium polysulfone membrane with 8.98 nm ionic clusters exhibited the high CO2 permeability of 1109.44 Barrer and a high CO2/CH4 selectivity of 29.70, which exceeds 2008 Robeson upper bound limit. The optimized separation performance of QA-PSf membranes is attractive for potential application such as CO2 capture from flue gas and natural gas. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The drag properties of flow through and around square arrays of 10 x 10 evenly spaced circular cylinders with a wide range of solid fraction phi from 9.69 x 10(-11) to 0.785 and Reynold number of the array Re from 1 to 50 are investigated numerically. The purpose of the present study is to better understand the phenomena of flow through and around permeable bodies that appear in bioreactors and fluid-solid reactors, for example. Instead of using the semi-empirical porous medium model, the direct numerical simulation is employed in order to investigate the flow mechanism from a microscopic point of view. A peak in drag coefficient is observed for the range of phi investigated, which appears at a smaller phi as Re increases. Three flow regimes are identified based on the shape effects quantified via the averaged velocity within the array, and the drag property in each regime is analyzed. A novel drag formula is also found by investigating the dependence of drag on phi and R (Reynolds number based on the mean velocity within the array). Finally, the dimensionless macroscopic permeability Da is estimated via the Darcy's law. The drag ratio computed is in a good agreement with the previous results from porous media models.

AB The rotating packed bed (RPB) is a promising reactor for CO2 capture with liquid amine because of its high mass transfer rate and energy and space savings. The CFD simulations of RPBs generally use the volume of fluid (VOF) method, but this method is prohibitively expensive for 3D simulations, in particular for large-scale reactors. The Eulerian method is a promising and effective method; however, there are still several difficulties, such as the settings for the porous media models in the gas-liquid counter-current flow and the interfacial area between the gas and liquid. To overcome these difficulties in the Eulerian method, this paper uses a new porous media model, a novel liquid generation-elimination model for numerically investigating the gas-liquid counter-current flow in RPBs and a new interfacial area model derived from the VOF simulation. These new models, incorporating the two-film reaction-enhancement mass transfer model, have successfully simulated the CO2 capture process with monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions in a RPB under both low (30 wt%) and high (90 wt%) concentration conditions. The results show that the overall gas phase mass transfer coefficient (K(G)a) increases with increasing the rotation speeds and the liquid to gas mass flow rate (L/G ratio). The simulations were validated by the experimental data and the results were analysed and discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The most challenging problem for simulating conjugate mass transfer problem is the variable concentration jump described by the double film theory at the phase interface. In the present paper, the physical mechanism of Henry's law is analyzed, and it is found that Henry's law can be expressed as a relation between two constant weight coefficients in lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). As a consequence, a unified multi-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) for conjugate mass transfer is proposed. The asymptotic analysis proves that the interface conditions, including the concentration jump determined by the double film theory and mass flux continuity, can be ensured with second-order accuracy. Five test cases containing both transient and steady conjugate mass transfer problems with straight or curved interfaces are calculated to validate the present method. The results show that the proposed MRT LBE has both simplicity and good accuracy. It is capable of simulating conjugate mass transfer at both steady and transient periods, with a stationary or moving interface. Especially, it has a good numerical stability at large distribution coefficient and diffusivity coefficient ratio. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present research work describes the preparation of silver nanoparticles from silver nitrate, and Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum) leaf extract, impregnation on titanium dioxide (TiO2) and evaluation of the catalytic activity of this nano silver impregnated TiO2 in the oxidation reaction of thiophene. Tertiarybutyl hydroperoxide was used as an oxidant in the reaction. The catalyst was characterized by BET, SEM, XRF, TEM, UV-Vis spectroscopy, XPS and TPR. The effect of process parameters such as speed of agitation, catalyst weight, oxidant to sulfur mole ratio, silver loading in the catalyst and temperature on the oxidation reaction was studied. Both pseudo-homogeneous and heterogeneous kinetic models were considered and applied for the result. The pseudo-homogeneous form of rate equation shows the reaction follows second order kinetics and is endothermic. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model is proposed, considering the reaction as a heterogeneous one with solid catalyst and found that surface reaction is the rate controlling step. This model is well fitted with experimental data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An ultra-thin liquid film flowing down a vertical uniformly heated cylinder under the influence of gravity is investigated. A thin liquid film model is derived, assuming that the film thickness h is much smaller than the fiber radius a. To predict the breakup of film, the van der Waals attraction, proportional to h(-3), is taken into account. Linear stability analysis shows that the Rayleigh-Plateau instability is enhanced by the long-range attractions and Marangoni effect. The spatial-temporal stability analysis shows that the instability is absolute when A + M > 0.17 (A is a composite Hamaker number accounting for the strength of van der Waals attractions and M is the Marangoni number). A self-similarity analysis shows that the film thins as h similar to(t(r) - t)(1/5) (t(r) is the breakup time), which is supported by the numerical simulations of the thin film model. Although the scaling is independent on the Marangoni effect, nonlinear simulations demonstrate that the breakup time t(r) decreases as the Marangoni effect becomes stronger, demonstrating that the breakup process is accelerated by the Marangoni effect. Nonlinear simulation also shows that the thin heated or non-heated film mainly breaks up in the absolutely unstable regime. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Alumina ceramic membranes were synthesized by pressing boehmite into disc form and sintering at different temperatures. Quantitative X-ray diffraction (QXRD) analysis was firstly used for determining the compositions of different types of alumina in membrane products. The result quantitative determined that alumina membranes experienced a series of phase transition from boehmite gamma-alumina -> delta-alumina -> theta-alumina -> alpha-alumina from 450 to 1300 degrees C. Below 850 degrees C, no significant alumina transformation (i.e. gamma-alumina was the dominate phase) was detected in fabricated membranes, which corresponded to stable membrane properties (i.e. porosity, BET surface area, pore size and chemical stability). At 950-1300 degrees C, substantial phase transformation was detected as follows, theta-alumina significantly increased from 1.21 to 61.6% (950-1125 degrees C), and alpha-alumina increased gradually from 3.98 to 100% (1100-1300 degrees C). Accordingly, the substantial phase transformation lead to the significant change in membrane properties at 950-1300 degrees C. Lower temperature (1150 degrees C) membrane containing 8.2% theta-alumina and 91.8% alpha-alumina showed comparable properties with 1300 degrees C consist of 100% alpha-alumina sintered products due to the similar alumina composition in the products. The overall results indicated that the properties of membrane were accordingly determined by the structure and content of alumina phases in membrane products. This strategy proposed a valuable method for production of lower temperature alumina-based ceramic membrane. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Supercritical water fluidized bed (SCWFB) is a newly developed reactor for coal and biomass gasification without releasing pollutants. The knowledge of two-phase flow properties in SCWFB is still lacked so far in literatures due to the extreme operating condition of high-pressure and high-temperature supercritical water. In this paper, a special dual-capacitance probe measurement system is developed for the extreme flow environment in SCWFB. It is found that the linear relationship is more precise in converting the capacitance of the probe sensor into local volume fraction of solids in SCWFB than Bottcher relationship. With the help of the newly-developed dual-capacitance probe measurement system, an experimental study on the bubbling fluidization in a SCWFB is carried out when the system pressure is in the range of 20-27 MPa and the system temperature is in the range of 410-570 degrees C. Four groups of quartz sands with different mean diameters which belong to Geldart type B classification are fluidized. It is found that the bed expansion method which was used in literatures to identify the onset of bubbling fluidization in supercritical carbon dioxide fluidized bed doesn't have enough precision in a SCWFB. To solve this problem, a new method of identifying the onset of bubbling fluidization in SCWFB is proposed. The minimum bubbling Reynolds number increases with the Archimedes number in a logarithmic relationship in SCWFB. At last, a new predicting correlation of the minimum bubbling fluidization velocity in SCWFB is proposed: Re-mb = 26.7091n(Ar + 10253.88) - 247.339, 1900 < Ar < 180000
   The relative error of the new predicting correlation is within +/- 20% and the averaged relative error is 7.5%. The research work in this paper provides useful guidance for the optimization and operation of SCWFB reactor. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A computational methodology is introduced for the development of a Reduced Order Model (ROM) using data from low-fidelity, in terms of the spatial discretization, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The methodology is applied in the context of investigating efficiently, new chemistry pathways in Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) processes by comparing experimental findings with simulation results. The proposed approach involves building a very coarse, yet three-dimensional CFD model of the process that does not include chemical reactions, which provides "snapshots", i.e. time instances, of the dynamic behavior of the system. This bundle of low-fidelity data is used for generating a reduced order model by implementing Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), for the time-invariant subspace approximation of the data and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the time-dependent coefficients. This last step circumvents the need for Galerkin projection of the equations on the subspace, rendering therefore the approach equation-free and purely data-driven. The ultimate goal addressed in this work is to produce fast approximations of the temperature, pressure and flow field in a CVD reactor, which will then be used as starting points of high-fidelity, in terms of the computational mesh, CFD simulations, that include multiple surface and gas phase reactions. Given the quality of approximations, the model corrects for the species distributions after only a few time-steps, providing thus quick and accurate deposition-rate and uniformity results. This allows for efficient and easy fine-tuning adjustments of the chemistry model diminishing the need to solve the high-fidelity model many times. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Density functional theory calculations have been performed to understand the reaction mechanisms of the industrial desulfurization process, also called the Takahax process, which is used in Japanese steelworks to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from coke oven gas. In this process, H2S is oxidized by 1,4-naphthoquinone-2-sulfonic acid (NQS), which is itself reduced to 1,4-dihydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonic acid (NQSH(2)). NQS can be regarded as a catalyst. On the basis of our calculations, we have revealed that the rate-determining steps in the catalytic reactions can be characterized as proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) that is governed by the frontier molecular orbitals of catalysts. Furthermore, energetic considerations show that the sequential electron and proton transfer mechanism may comparably contribute to the concerted mechanism depending on the magnitude of the electrostatic interaction between the electron donor and acceptor that stabilizes the TS of the concerted PCET.

AB To continue towards long-term reduction in the price of energy generated by photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, technological innovations are needed to achieve significant increases in device efficiency without increasing manufacturing costs. One approach is to utilize the existing capability to manufacture thin film CdTe PVs at very low cost and add another inexpensive thin film absorber to create a tandem solar cell to improve device efficiency. For this, a semiconductor with an optimal bandgap must be identified, along with a suitable device architecture. The wide bandgap perovskite methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3, MAPBr) has a well-matched band gap of 2.3 eV for a CdTe tandem device. It can be processed at relatively low temperature, and is also suitable for CIGS and all-perovskite tandems. We fabricated MAPBr PVs and found that optical scattering, or haze, was significant in these perovskite layers. This limits the transmitted light reaching the bottom cell. The performance of a four-terminal (4T) perovskite-CdTe tandem cell was modeled using the 1D Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS) software package to determine how much haze could be tolerated and still achieve an efficiency boost compared to the CdTe cell.

AB Phenol is commercially produced through cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) cleavage in kettle reactor, having the disadvantages of hazard potential, low selectivity, low efficiency and complicated process. In the study, microchannel reactor has been introduced into the decomposition using sulfuric acid as the catalyst. The influences of various reaction conditions, including temperature, the ratio of sulfuric acid/CHP and residence time, on the reaction have been studied. Compared with kettle reactor, the present process can afford almost quantitative yield of phenol with reduced acid amount and shortened reaction time under higher reaction temperature. The microchannel process can also provide higher security of CHP cleavage. The microtechnology probably gives an alternative protocol for the production of phenol through CHP decomposition. In addition, the possible main reaction pathways for the CHP cleavage in microchannel reactor have been discussed according to the obtained results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate prediction of flow patterns and their transition is extremely important for proper design, operation and optimization of two-phase flow systems, since the parameters such as pressure loss and heat and mass transfer are strongly dependent on the flow pattern. So far, the non-swirling gas-liquid flow in straight pipes have been widely studied and various mechanisms that lead to flow pattern transition have been clarified and modeled. However, the dynamics of gas-liquid flow under swirling condition are not well understood, and no detailed models are available for the prediction of swirling flow pattern transition. To address this, in our previous work (Liu and Bai, 2018), a visualization experiment aimed at classifying flow regimes in swirling gas-liquid flow was presented and three typical swirling flow regimes, i.e., swirling gas column flow, swirling intermittent flow and swirling annular flow were classified and defined, respectively. As the swirling annular flow can be regarded as a special case of conventional annular flow (i.e., when tangential velocity does not equal zero), in present paper, a mechanistic model for the prediction of the swirling annular flow pattern transition was developed considering its physical interest and great practical significance. Two physical mechanisms that lead to the transition from swirling annular flow to other flow patterns were revealed and modeled, respectively. The model was evaluated against a wide range of swirling and non-swirling experimental data and based on this model, the effects of different parameters (e.g., hydraulic diameter, working pressure and swirl angle) on the boundary of flow pattern transition were presented. Results revealed that the range of swirling annular flow enlarges with the increase of the working pressure and swirl angle but narrows with the hydraulic diameter. Taking these influencing factors into account, a generalized formula for the prediction of the swirling annular flow pattern transition was proposed. Compared with existing empirical correlations for annular flow, the newly developed correlation provided more accurate and reasonable prediction of flow pattern transition for both swirling annular flow and annular flow.

AB Epoxidation of oleic acid by peracetic acid (PAA) was studied in a recycled reactor system under conventional heating and microwave irradiation. This reaction system consists of several steps. Thus, a kinetic modelling strategy to diminish the number of parameters to be estimated was developed by investigating each reaction step: PAA synthesis and decomposition, epoxidation and ring-opening. The energy balance for microwave heating was correlated with the concentration of the microwave-absorbent species and the total input power of the microwaves. The epoxidation reaction was conducted in the vigorously stirred tank reactor under isothermal conditions within a temperature range of 50-70 degrees C. The organic phase content was 32-45% v/v. The interfacial mass transfer was supposed to be faster than the intrinsic reaction kinetics suppressing the use of mass transfer correlations. Nonlinear regression was used to estimate the kinetic parameters. Two models were developed for microwave and conventional heating respectively. The perhydrolysis showed to be the slowest reaction, followed by the epoxidation and the ring-opening. The use of microwave irradiation resulted in considerable process intensification for the epoxidation process. By employing microwave heating, the perhydrolysis step in the aqueous phase was enhanced, and the reaction time was reduced by 50% in best cases, which implies that the reactor size can be diminished by microwave technology.

AB This article describes an approach to render all walls of a rectangular microchannel superhydrophobic by coating them with hydrophobically modified silica nanoparticles. Differences between the coated nanoparticles in terms of feature size and structure resulted in different contact angle hysteresis (CAH) on the channel walls. The generation of water slugs in a continuous air flow was experimentally studied in the superhydrophobic microchannels with T-junction. The breakup mechanism of water slugs was proved to accord with the squeezing regime by analyzing the data collected from pressure sensor and high-speed camera at the T-junction. A home-made optical measurement system was employed to investigate the uniformity of the water slugs, which was characterized by the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of slug length. The results showed that superhydrophobic microchannels with CAH lower than 15 degrees could produce uniform water slugs in a slug flow pattern, whereas those with CAH of nearly 30 degrees led to unstable flow. Lower CAH and higher gas flow rate were preferred to reduce slug length and improve slug uniformity. An empirical scaling law was established to predict the slug length and was based on the finding that the total length and number of water slugs in the microchannel were controlled by the volumetric flow ratio of water to air and water flow rate, respectively. This work provides a novel microfluidic platform to generate uniform liquid-in-gas slugs under moderate ranges of air flow rate from 5 mL min(-1) to 30 mL min(-1)(6 < Re-G < 40) and volumetric flow ratio of water to air from 1/300 to 1/2, and this performance benefits from superhydrophobic coatings with low CAH.

AB In non-isothermal flows through porous media, the rate of heat transport across the domain and the distribution of temperature profile are strongly affected by the thermal properties of the fluid and solid phases, flow conditions, and the topological geometry of the pore structure. The combined effect of these parameters on the dynamics of heat transfer is generally characterized by the thermal dispersion coefficient. In this study, we model thermal dispersion in granular porous media using pore-scale numerical simulations. The flow and heat transport equation are solved in a porous domain at the pore-level to obtain the distribution of temperature inside the fluid phase and solid grains. The effluent temperature profile at the outlet is then fitted to the analytical solution of the macroscale heat advection-dispersion equation to determine the longitudinal component of the effective thermal dispersion tensor. Several simulation runs are carried out to investigate the effect of Peclet number, fluid to solid thermal conductivity and heat capacity ratios, and the temperature-dependent viscosity on the variation of the longitudinal thermal dispersion coefficient. The results indicate the existence of different thermal dispersion regimes separated by a threshold Peclet number. Below the threshold, thermal dispersion is dominated by conduction and longitudinal dispersion coefficient is equal to the effective thermal conductivity of the porous medium. Above the threshold, there is a transition region in which both conduction and advection are responsible for the heat ttansport. At higher Peclet numbers, dispersion regime is advection-dominated and normalized dispersion coefficient increases with the Peclet number and thermal conductivity ratio whereas it decreases with the heat capacity ratio. In this regime, the relationship between dispersion coefficient and Peclet number follows a power-law functionality with the exponent decreasing with the heat capacity ratio. To summarize the results, a characterization diagram is constructed for thermal dispersion regime based on the values of Peclet number and thermal conductivity ratio. Finally, the presence of viscous fingering due to the monotonically increasing viscosity along the flow is observed to further increase the longitudinal thermal dispersion. The outcomes of this study are of great importance in the design, implementation, and performance optimization of thermal processes in granular porous media. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The numerical simulation for micro-mixing of the combined electroosmotic-pressure driven flow inside the microchannels with the triangular obstacles (hurdles) and heterogeneous zeta-potential is carried out. The simulation is conducted by solving the steady state equations of momentum, electric fields and concentration field, while the Nernst-Planck equation is used for identifying the ions distribution inside the channel. It is supposed that a fluid having different concentrations enters the 2D rectangular microchannel. The results show that for the straight homogeneous microchannels, greater adverse pressure gradients cause better mixing. Moreover, the microchannels having the hurdles or heterogeneous zeta-potential produce the superior mixing performance such that the mixing efficiency increases up to 15.4% and 48.1% for the microchannels with the hurdles and heterogeneous zeta-potential, respectively. This improvement reaches 87% for the microchannels with both hurdles and zeta-potential heterogeneity. It is found that the location of the hurdles does not affect the mixing performance while the height of the hurdles has intense effect on the mixing quality. Thereby, changing the height of the hurdles from 0.05H to 0.2H, improves the mixing efficiency about 11.4% and 15.6% for the homogeneous and heterogeneous zeta-potential cases, respectively. The length of the hurdles has different effects based on the zeta-potential situation so that in the case of heterogeneous zeta-potential, length of the hurdles has intense effect on the mixing, while for the homogeneous channels, this effect dramatically decreases. It is also found that increasing the zeta-potential on the hurdles leads to better mixing performance while increment of the zeta-potential on the straight parts of the walls weakens the mixing performance. Investigating the effect of the charge arrangement shows that the NP-PN arrangement makes the mixing quality better. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The extensive researches about the thermodynamic and intrinsic kinetic of disproportionation reaction of methyl phenyl carbonate to diphenyl carbonate were investigated independently with dibutyltin oxide as a catalyst, at a temperature range of 433.15-473.15 K and different catalyst concentrations in a stirred batch reactor, for a deeper knowledge of reaction essence. This reaction was found endothermic and showed hardly any reaction in the absence of catalyst which indicate an inferior kinetic characteristics. The reaction rate increases with an increasing catalyst concentration until the concentration went to 8.08 x 10(4) mol mol( 1). A possible mechanism involving an in-situ Sn-based species was proposed and finally verified by a good agreement between experimental and simulated data. The available Sn-based species was then demonstrated to play a real catalytic role by extra experiments. All results can also be further utilized to explore the essence of transesterification reaction network. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been extensively attempted on all sections in development of functional materials such as material discovery, determination of experimental factors for the discovered materials, and tuning experimental factors to produce the selected materials. Design of experiment (DoE) and response surface methodology (RSM) are efficient strategies to screen experimental factors and study the correlation between material property and experimental factors. Usually, second order quadratic model is applied to construct the response surface. ML-based models, such as Gaussian process and neural networks, have also be implemented into the RSM. In this work, a ML model based on support vector machine (SVM) was built to analyze the high-throughput experimental data from DoE. Silica xerogel was chosen as a model material, the goal was to control the diversity of the silanol groups on the surfaces of silica. Silica samples were prepared following the central composite design (CCD) in a segmented continuous flow reactor. Sodium silicate and CO2 were used as the raw materials. Both quadratic model and SVM model were studied on the analysis of experimental data. SVM model showed better performance in fitting and predicting, which was attributed to the advantage of handling complex nonlinear correlations. Based on the response surface generated by the SVM model, correlations between experimental factors and diversity of silanol groups were identified. With the guidance of the SVM model, two samples with desired silica surface properties were prepared and attempted as supporting materials for heterogeneous catalysis. The impact of surface silanol groups on the catalytic performance was discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study mass transfer towards a solid spherical catalyst particle experiencing a first order irreversible reaction coupled to an external laminar flow. Internal chemical reaction and convective-diffusive mass transfer in the surrounding fluid flow are coupled by concentration and flux boundary conditions at the particle surface. Through this coupling, the mean particle surface and volume concentrations are predicted and the internal/external Sherwood numbers are obtained. We investigate the interplay between convection, diffusion, and reaction by computational fluid dynamics and establish a model for the mass transfer coefficient accounting for diffusion and internal first-order chemical reaction. We obtain a prediction of the mass transfer coefficient through mass balance or using the classical additivity rule. The model is numerically validated by fully resolved numerical simulations over a wide range of Reynolds number, Schmidt number and Thiele modulus which shows that assuming decoupled treatment of external and internal mass transfer gives very accurate predictions. Finally, we test the unsteady response of the model. The model predicts the evolution of the mean volume concentration for a particle placed in a steady convective-diffusive stream. Predictions of the unsteady model are in very good agreement with computed results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper extends equilibrium theory of ion exchange chromatography to account for variable solution normality and steric hindrance. Both effects are crucial for many separations including the separation of proteins. Analytical solutions are given for a full chromatographic cycle consisting of the loading of an empty bed equilibrated at different salt concentrations followed by a regeneration step. Special emphasis is on selectivity reversals. It is shown that additional reversals may occur due to a change in solution normality. Results are illustrated step by step and relation to ion exchange chromatography with constant solution normality and/or mass action equilibrium without steric hindrance is discussed. Theoretical findings are validated by comparison with numerical simulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rotating packed beds (RPBs), as a type of process intensification technology, are promising to be employed as high-efficiency CO2 absorbers. However, the detailed understanding of the liquid flow in the RPB is still very limited. The complex and dense packing of the bed and the multiscale of the RPB make it very difficult to perform numerical simulations in detail, in particular for full 3D simulations. In this paper, a mesoscale 3D CFD modelling approach is proposed which can be used to investigate the liquid flow in both laboratory- and large-scale RPBs in detail and accuracy. A 3D representative elementary unit of the RPB has been built and validated with experimental observations, and then it is employed to investigate the gas-liquid flows at different locations, across a typical RPB, so that the overall characteristics of the liquid flow in the RPB can be assembled. The proposed approach enables the detailed prediction of the liquid holdup, droplets formation, effective interfacial area, wetted packing area and specific surface area of the liquid within real 3D packing structures throughout the bed. New correlations to predict the liquid holdup, effective interfacial area, and specific surface area of the liquid are proposed, and the sensitivities of these quantities to the rotational speed, liquid flow rate, viscosity and contact angle have been investigated. The results have been compared with experimental data, previous correlations and theoretical values and it shows that the new correlations have a good accuracy in predicting these critical quantities. Further, recommendations for scale-up and operation of an RPB for CO2 capture are provided. This proposed model leads to a much better understanding of the liquid flow behaviours and can assist in the RPB optimisation design and scaling up. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FINITE PULSE-TIME; TEMPERATURE
AB The laser flash method for measuring thermal diffusivity of solids involves subjecting the front face of a small sample to a heat pulse of radiant energy and recording the resulting temperature rise on the opposite (rear) surface. For the adiabatic case, the widely-used standard approach estimates the thermal diffusivity from the rear-surface temperature rise history by calculating the half rise time: the time required for the temperature rise to reach one half of its maximum value. In this article, we develop a novel alternative approach by expressing the thermal diffusivity exactly in terms of the area enclosed by the rear-surface temperature rise curve and the steady-state temperature over time. Approximating this integral numerically leads to a simple formula for the thermal diffusivity involving the rear-surface temperature rise history. Using synthetic experimental data we demonstrate that the new formula produces estimates of the thermal diffusivity - for a typical test case - that are more accurate and less variable than the standard approach. The article concludes by briefly commenting on extension of the new method to account for heat losses from the sample. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a CFD model and hydrodynamic study of a moving-baffle oscillatory baffled column (moving-baffle OBC). This work marks the first instance that moving overset meshing was used to simulate agitator motion in a fluid system. Population balance results are validated with experimental data for the inverse-suspension of non-reactive aqueous acrylamide in Isopar oil. A comparison of the droplet size distributions produced via various multiphase simulation methods was performed, resulting in a better overall agreement with the experimental literature for simulations applying the volume of fluid (VOF) multiphase method. Hydrodynamic studies reveal patterns of local flow circulations and center-most axial currents in relation to agitator position. Examination of the dimensionless groups traditionally used to describe flow conditions for moving-baffle OBCs reveal a considerable discrepancy between the previously-defined oscillatory Reynolds number and oscillatory Strouhal number with numbers derived from fluid flow within the column. A numerical correction has been presented to illustrate the nonlinear effect of oscillation amplitude on fluid flow through the system and to provide a more realistic estimation of the Reynolds number and Strouhal number for the modeled moving-baffle OBC.

AB For impacts on plane surfaces (plates), the coefficient of restitution or more precisely, the energy dissipation due to elastic waves (Rayleigh, longitudinal, transverse and flexural waves) on the one hand and due to viscoelastic properties on the other hand is calculated, analysed and experimentally investigated. Models concerning elastic waves (Zener, Hunter) and their modifications introduced by us within our latest publications (Boettcher et al., 2016, 2017a, 2017b), which (like the majority of the models in literature) are related to spheres and parabolically impinging bodies, are briefly summarized and extended for the impact of cones to achieve a more realistic description of impact processes and a better understanding of the physical relations.
   The bending model of Zener is described on the basis of rheological models (contact model) and a simple, general viscoelastic model for a sphere is introduced. Furthermore, two different variants of a combined model are derived with which the coefficient of restitution based on flexural waves (inelasticity parameter lambda) and viscoelastic properties (viscoelastic inelasticity parameter xi) can be calculated. Likewise, analytically approximate solutions are derived. In chemical and process engineering, the proposed approach enables for instance a better description of the impact process between (elastic-plastic) granules or particles with viscous properties (e.g., gamma-Al2O3 or synthetic granules) and thin apparatus walls at which flexural waves as well as viscous damping can depict a (decisive) role (fluidized bed, pneumatic conveying).
   First experimental evaluations show the extent to which viscoelasticity depends on the individual materials and the influence of viscoelasticity within the range of the (developing) flexural wave. The combined model shows a qualitative good agreement to the experimental measurements, but also an increasing deviation from the experimental values with increasing viscous damping.

AB Swirling flow is one of the commonly-recognized techniques to control working processes in various engineering fields. A fundamental understanding of the swirling flow pattern is significantly important for proper design, operation and optimization of swirling flow systems. Although a large amount of work has been done on conventional non-swirling two-phase flow, investigations on swirling flow regime classification are still scarce. In this paper, a visualization experiment was carried out to study the gas-liquid flow in a vertical pipe containing a swirler with four helical vanes. The typical flow regimes in swirling gas-liquid flow were first classified and defined by visual observation. Subsequently, the liquid holdup was measured with the proposed image processing technique and statistically analyzed through PDF and CPDF. Owing to its integral and stable feature, CPDF was then utilized along with a self-organizing neural network (SONN) to identify the swirling flow regimes objectively. Finally, a swirling flow regime map was proposed and compared with the previous non-swirling and swirling maps available in the publications. Based on this study, the influence of the centrifugal force on phase distribution of gas-liquid flow was clarified and the general relationship between swirling gas-liquid flow and non-swirling gasliquid flow was concluded.

AB In this paper, a semi-empirical drying model for convective drying of a single wood particle at elevated temperature is developed based on the reaction engineering approach (REA). The parameter of this model is determined and verified against both experimental and numerical data. The method proposed to identify the REA model parameter operates as follows: the evolution of the moisture content of a single wood particle over time is measured accurately by using a magnetic suspension balance. A continuum-scale model that takes into account major transport mechanisms relevant to wood particle drying is developed within the frame of volume averaging approach. Continuum model predictions are successfully assessed against the measurements conducted at four different inlet gas temperatures. A set of numerical simulation results obtained at 120 degrees C is used to deduce the REA model parameter. The fact that the REA model can fairly well reflect the experimental data at higher drying temperatures, i.e. 140 degrees C, 160 degrees C and 180 degrees C, is used to evaluate the accuracy of the REA model parameter. The REA model is also assessed using the continuum model simulations which are obtained for particles of different dimeters (2-20 mm) in a wide range of drying conditions (initial moisture content varies between 0.3 kg water/kg dry solid and 0.6 kg water/kg dry solid and air velocity between 0.005 m/s and 5 m/s). The results indicate that the REA model parameter is insensitive to variations of the drying conditions with an exception of inlet air velocity. The developed REA model can thus be considered as a simple predictive tool for drying of wood particles in a wide range of process conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A computational platform for direct numerical simulation of fluid-particle two-phase flow in porous media is presented in this study. In the proposed platform, the Navier-Stokes equations are used to describe the motion of the continuous phase, while the discrete element method (DEM) is employed to evaluate particle-particle and particle-wall interactions, with a fictitious domain method being adopted to evaluate particle-fluid interactions. Particle-wall contact states are detected by the ERIGID scheme. Moreover, a new scheme, namely, base point-increment method is developed to improve the accuracy of particle tracking in porous media. In order to improve computationally efficiency, a time splitting strategy is applied to couple the fluid and DEM solvers, allowing different time steps to be used which are adaptively determined according to the stability conditions of each solver. The proposed platform is applied to particle transport in a porous medium with its pore structure being reconstructed from micro-CT scans from a real rock. By incorporating the effect of pore structure which has a comparable size to the particles, numerical results reveal a number of distinct microscopic flow mechanisms and the corresponding macroscopic characteristics. The time evolution of the inlet to outlet pressure-difference consists of large-scale spikes and small-scale fluctuations. Apart from the influence through direct contacts between particles, the motion of a particle can also be affected by particles without contact through blocking a nearby passage for fluid flow. Particle size has a profound influence on the macroscopic motion behavior of particles. Small particles are easier to move along the main stream and less dispersive in the direction perpendicular to the flow than large particles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article evaluates the slurry viscosity of radioactive waste. Hanford waste is a motley mixture of particle sizes and densities composed of metal and oxide particles with constituents spanning much of the periodic table stored at high ionic strength and high pH. Hanford wastes have traditionally been represented as simply an ideal Bingham plastic, but this rheological approximation often provides a poor fit from 0 to 200 1/s, precisely the range of interest for engineering design of waste transport and mixing systems. A modified Cross formulation inclusive of a yield stress is used to fit stress-strain rate data for reconstituted Hanford REDOX sludge waste, measured by increasing shear-rate (up-ramp) and decreasing shear-rate (down-ramp) sweeps. This continuous single equation formulation quantitatively matches experimental data better than other rheological models including the Bingham plastic and Herschel-Bulkley approximations. The increase of viscosity and yield stress from up ramp to down ramp suggests the formation of particle microstructure during shear due to attractive forces. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding ignition and extinction behavior is of crucial importance for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). Therefore, for the first time the bifurcation behavior of OCM has been investigated while considering both homogeneous gas phase reactions and heterogeneous reactions using a detailed microkinetic model. Three different adiabatic reactor models are considered: a plug flow reactor (PFR), a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a lumped thermal reactor (LTR) model. The latter represents the limiting case with zero backmixing (cf. PFR behavior) for species and perfect thermal backmixing (cf. CSTR behavior). For homogeneous processes this reactor type could for example be realized by adding a high thermal conductivity inert to the reactor tubes, for catalytic processes a high thermal conductivity catalyst could be used.
   The bifurcation behavior in these reactor types is compared with a focus on methane conversion, C-2 yields and their dependence on operating conditions such as inlet composition, inlet temperature and space time. Steady state multiplicity is observed for adiabatic CSTR and LTR models. This multiplicity of steady states is not observed for isothermal reactor models, indicating that it is caused solely by thermal backmixing and is not related to chemical feedback features such as autocatalysis. The start-up procedures or initial conditions determine the actual steady state that is obtained. Among the three investigated reactor types, a LTR shows the highest product yields and the lowest extinction temperatures, which allows autothermal operation at a much lower inlet temperature compared to a PFR and CSTR. For OCM without catalyst, autothermal operation on the ignited branch at ambient inlet temperatures and reasonable space times is only possible by using methane-to-oxygen ratios below 3 leading to low selectivities. For catalytic OCM compared to OCM without catalyst, the range for autothermal operation is much broader and it is much easier to find feasible operating conditions allowing autothermal operation at ambient inlet temperatures.
   By operating a LTR on the ignited branch at ambient inlet temperature of 300 K, methane-to-oxygen ratio CH4:O-2 = 6, space time V/F-CH4,F-0= 0.02 s, bulk density of Sn-Li/MgO = 1000 kg(cat)/m(3) and pressure P =1 bar, overall C-2 selectivities (i.e. sum of ethane, ethylene and acetylene selectivity) of 80% can be obtained at methane conversions as high as 30%.

AB Targets and benchmarks are useful in chemical process design as they provide an objective, quantitative assessment of a proposed process flowsheet. In addition, with target bounds on reaction selectivity one can also explore the sustainability limits for a chemistry of interest. Unfortunately, targets for reaction selectivity are difficult to obtain using conventional design methods. In 2001, Feinberg and Ellison developed the Continuous Flow Stirred Tank Reactor (CFSTR) Equivalence Principle, providing a methodology to obtain ultimate bounds on steady-state productivity for a chemistry of interest entirely independent of process design. In previous articles, we showed how the CFSTR Equivalence Principle can be used to obtain bounds on reaction selectivity independent of process design for steady-state processes. In this article we prove that the CFSTR Equivalence Principle is also applicable to batch and semi-batch processes, thus providing a unifying framework to obtain an ultimate target for reaction selectivity applicable to all candidate processes for a chemistry of interest. This limit also applies to systems with periodic and chaotic operations. We demonstrate the method with an example for the production of lactic acid through the alkaline conversion of fructose.

AB The vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of toluene-ionic liquid (IL) from short- to long-chain imidazolium-based ILs (i.e., [C4MIM](+), [C8MIM](+), [C10MIM](+), and [C12MIM](+)) with various anions (i.e., [BF4], [PF6], and [Tf2N]) was first measured under wide concentration and temperature ranges. These thermodynamic data are of great significance for an in-depth understanding with respect to capturing condensable gases with ILs. The UNIFAC-Lei model was applied to describe the VLE and successfully extended from short- to long-chain imidazolium-based ILs. For the ILs with relatively short alkyl side-chains on cations (e.g., [C4MIM](+) and [C8MIM](+)), the vapor pressure depends on the types of both anions and cations, while for the ILs with long alkyl side chains on cations (e.g., [C10MIM](+) and [C12MIM](+)), the vapor pressure is mainly dependent on the type of cations. Moreover, the COSMO-RS model and quantum chemistry calculations were used together to provide microscopic insights into the effect of IL structures on the VLE of toluene-IL systems.

AB Mechanical equilibrium of particles attached to rock during flow is defined as torque balance of attaching and detaching forces. Oversaturated state of fines means that detaching torque exceeds the attaching torque, and fines detach as the flow starts. In undersaturation, the attaching torque dominates the detaching torque, and fines mobilisation can occur only if there is either additional detaching torque or a weakening of the attaching torque. Preliminary laboratory tests determine the mechanical equilibrium velocity and salinity, to ensure that oversaturation or undersaturation can be readily reproduced in further corefloods. We formulate the basic governing equations and derive exact solutions for over and undersaturated cases. The exact solutions allow formulating the fingerprints for transport of oversaturated and undersaturated fines in porous media. The coreflood results reveal the characteristic features of the oversaturated case of fines migration. Moreover, the analytical modelling results are found to be in high agreement with the experimental data, under the typical values of the fitted model coefficients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A 2D computational fluid dynamic-based finite element model was developed to describe water flux and concentration polarization in forward osmosis (FO) under steady-state conditions. The extended UNIQAC equation in the feed and the Flory Huggins equation on the membrane side were solved simultaneously to calculate the activity coefficients of the diffusion components. The ratio of the feed component activity coefficient to that on the membrane surface was defined as the sorption coefficient. Employing the sorption coefficient led to a significantly improved accuracy of the developed model in estimating water flux. The membrane structural parameter determining internal concentration polarization (ICP) should be maintained at reasonable values. Otherwise, it may significantly increase the reverse salt flux and external concentration polarization (ECP) on the active layer. This suggests the tradeoffs between the membrane structural parameter and membrane selectivity, between ECP and ICP. Water fluxes were similar in counter-current and co-current flow modes. ICP had the most significant resistance to flow, reducing the water flux up to 75%. ECP on the feed side had a limited effect on FO water flux, particularly at high flow velocity. ECP on the draw side and reverse salt flux had negligible effects on FO water flux in our modeling. Our study provides important insights into developing high-performance FO membranes with reasonably low structural parameters and improving FO water flux by reducing the key limiting factor (e.g. ICP).

AB Mixed-cation LiSr-LSX, AgCa-LSX and AgSr-LSX containing minimum lithium and silver were prepared by exchanging small fractions of Li+ into Sr-LSX and Ag+ into Sr-LSX and Ca-LSX. To avoid diffusion of the Li+ into the inaccessible sites, the LiSr-LSX sample was exposed to a specifically derived dehydration condition. Similarly, the mixed-silver cation samples were treated to the selected condition post-ion-exchange to allow the Ag+ to migrate into SII+. Strong evidences were provided that significant fractions of the exchanged Li+ and Ag+ remained in SIII and SII+ respectively after comparisons of the N-2/O-2 adsorption isotherms and isosteric heats of adsorption of the mixed-cation and single-cation samples. Furthermore, the mixed-cation LiSr-LSX, AgCa-LSX and AgSr-LSX samples were compared against the single-cation Li-LSX sample based on their O-2 productivity performance via a PSA simulation model.

AB The development of CFD models coupled with Population Balance is a very promising topic concerning multiphase reactors. In the case of bubbly flows and bubble columns, a serious lack of local hydrodynamic characterizations still harms development and validation of relevant models. To fill partially this gap, a new bubble size measurement technique, previously introduced by Maximiano Raimundo et al. (2016), has been applied on a very wide range of bubble column diameters (from 0.15 m to 3 m) and superficial gas velocities (from 0.06 m/s to 0.35 m/s). Size measurements have been coupled with others concerning gas holdup and axial liquid velocity, in order to provide an experimental database allowing to clarify the scale-up rules and to assist future modelling works. Average bubble sizes have been measured as globally similar at every scale. Measured holdup and average liquid velocity confirm already reported behaviours at lower column diameters. Liquid velocity fluctuations also follow self-similar radial profiles and are proportional to the average liquid velocity at the centre of the column leading to a strong turbulence intensity. The fact that the quantity (gD)(1/2) appears as a natural velocity scale and the presence of strong gas-holdup gradients underline the similarity between bubble columns operated heterogeneous regime and free thermal convection in pipes.

AB The investigation of water's flow behavior in nanoporous shale media is fundamental to the high-efficiency exploitation of shale gas reservoirs. Such an investigation can provide crucial theoretical foundations for the development of relevant techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing stimulation and reservoir productivity prospecting. Through the integration of the fractal model and nanoscale water transport mechanisms, this article presents an apparent liquid permeability (ALP) model of water flow in the mixed-wet shale matrix. This model incorporates various hydrodynamic features of water at the nanoscale and the pore structure characteristics of shale media. The ALP, the enhancement factor of the shale matrix, and the relative contributions of the organic and inorganic matter for the total ALP under different influencing factors were consequently analyzed. The results demonstrate that the wettability state of the inorganic matter has little effect on the ALP, and multilayer sticking that occurs in water transport leads to a slight decrease in the ALP. However, the ALP is very sensitive to the organic matter: when the organic nanopores become strongly hydrophobic, a dramatic increase in the ALP, resulting from a significant slip behavior, is observed. Additionally, shale's ALP increases or decreases, depending on the combined effects of the large-sized inorganic matter (generally larger than that of organic matter) and the more-hydrophobic organic matter. Furthermore, the structural parameters of shale media were studied. Thus, the developed model provides deeper insights into water transport in a shale matrix and a quantitative framework for future research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the mussel-inspired multifunctional coating was introduced in 2007, it has been utilized to modify membranes for a wide range of applications including ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. In this work, the effects of substrate pore size and coating conditions on the separation performance of organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) membranes were investigated. By using sulfonated polyphenylenesulfone (sPPSU) as the substrate material and polyethyleneimine and pyrocatechol as the coating materials, OSN membranes can be fabricated if the pores of the sPPSU substrates are less than 12 nm in diameter (determined by the solute transport method). The coated membranes show rejections greater than 93% towards molecules with molecular weights larger than 645 g/mol and a permeance of 11.9 L m(-2)h(-1)bar(-1) in ethanol. The addition of epichlorohydrin in the coating solution can significantly enhance membrane rejections to small molecules. The fabricated membranes demonstrate good stability in 7-day tetracycline filtration tests. The 2-pass rejection can reach 96.2% to tetracycline for tetracycline/isopropanol solutions. The newly developed one-step facile coating method has great potential to fabricate membranes for OSN applications in the pharmaceutical industry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The droplets, coal particles and ash/slag particles generated in impinging flame, atomization and violent reaction at the burner plane lead to complex deposition characteristics in the impinging entrained-flow coal gasifier. To investigate the detailed deposition behaviors around burner plane, a new visualization system combined with high temperature endoscope and high speed camera was applied to capture the detailed process of deposition. With classification and statistical method, the CWS droplet and coal/ash/slag particle deposition behaviors as well as the detachment of adhered particles were discussed. The results show that the droplet deposition behaviors were divided into three types: deform and rebound without adherence, breakup and rebound without adherence and breakup with partial rebound and partial adherence. Over 50% of the droplets deform without any other behaviors. Only about 15% of the droplets adhere to the refractory wall. The particle deposition behaviors were divided into four types: rebound completely without breakup and adherence, adhere completely without breakup and rebound, breakup and rebound completely without adherence and breakup with partial rebound and partial adherence. The particles around the burner tend to rebound and the particles between the burners tend to adhere. Over 60% of the particles completely or partially adhere to the refractory wall and only a few particles break up. The detachment behaviors were divided into four types: detach completely, breakup and detach, detach after impact and multi-mode detach. Because of the low conversion degree of the particles around burner plane, the detach percentage of the adhered particles is relatively high and half of adhered particles detaches from the refractory wall completely.

AB In this work, the turbulence in the vicinity of the liquid-liquid interfaces in an incompressible interfacial flow is investigated numerically and experimentally. A new large eddy simulation formulation is employed where all the subgrid scale (SGS) terms appearing in the filtered governing equations are closed by a volume of fluid-based Approximate Deconvolution Model (ADM-VOF) (Saeedipour et al., 2018). In this structural turbulence modelling approach, the SGS terms of stress tensor and surface tension in the Navier-Stokes equations, as well as the interface dynamics in the VOF transport equation, are mathematically reconstructed from the resolved scales. An oil-water benchmark experiment was designed for validation purposes where an oil layer is poured on the top of the water into which a submerged turbulent jet is injected and interacts with the oil-water interface. The interactions of the turbulence with the liquid-liquid interfaces are then studied by shadowgraphy visualization and time-resolved PIV measurement. Two sets of LES were performed using the ADM-VOF and a conventional LES model based on eddy-viscosity approach. The statistics of interfacial turbulence including velocity fluctuations and interface dynamics are analyzed and compared with the ones obtained from the experiment. The results reveal that in the interface vicinity the ADM-VOF approach, which reconstructs more turbulent scales and includes the SGS terms of turbulence-interface interactions, is of superior performance in predicting the energy spectra and statistics of turbulence. Far from the interface no particular difference between the LES models was observed. In addition, the temporal average of the interface motion as well as the evolution of the interfacial area is studied. While both models predict the averaged temporal evolution of the interface similarly, the ADM-VOF revealed its potentials for high fluctuating regions as it accounts for the effect of SGS term interface dynamics. This study provides a perspective for connecting the interfacial turbulence to metallurgical aspects of the continuous casting process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over one billion tons of food waste is generated every year worldwide. This waste represents a substantial part of municipal solid waste and is usually incinerated. The effective integration of the anaerobic digester process with the microbial fuel cell technology is an ecofriendly and promising solution for the treatment of food waste, which leads to clean energy generation and by-products of industrial interest. In this context, we here report the development of a floating air-cathode microbial fuel cell device and demonstrate electricity generation from fresh digestate, directly collected from an anaerobic digester effluent with no pre-treatment, used as the electrolyte, fuel and source of electroactive bacteria. The floating fuel cells are characterised by a simple yet innovative design. No metal catalyst is used at the cathode, and the use of a membrane is not required thanks to a natural vertical stratification of microorganisms in the digestate that prevents oxygen diffusion to the anode. Both the wettability and the surface area of the anode are enhanced with a two-step pre-treatment, which enhances the electrochemical performance of the electrode, leading to an oxidation peak twice greater than the non-treated electrode. The individual microbial fuel cell unit generated a power peak of 0.043 +/- 0.001 mW, which increased linearly by connecting several units electrically in parallel in a stack and reached the value of 0.43 mW (corresponding to 51 +/- 2 mW m(-3)) with ten units. Considering the simplicity and affordability of the design proposed, which facilitates upscaling, this work paves the way for a promising and environmentally friendly alternative to food waste incineration.

AB The effect of internals on the fluidization dynamics in three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical fluidized beds was studied using real-time magnetic resonance imaging. Instantaneous snapshots of particle velocity and particle position were acquired for gas velocities U below and above the minimum fluidization velocity U-mf. Below U-mf, we found local fluidization and gas bubbling in areas adjacent to an inserted horizontal tube, likely caused by the gas locally exceeding U-mf as it flows around the insert. Above U-mf, the presence of the insert in the bed affected the fluidization dynamics. The wake region above the insert exhibited a lower average particle velocity and reduced velocity fluctuations as well as a substantially reduced number and size of gas bubbles as compared to a reference bed without internals. The extent of this wake region was found to be approximately as wide as the insert, and it extended from the top of the insert to the free surface of the bed. Moreover, the presence of internals also affected the regions below the insert by showing an increased rate of bubble formation directly below the inserted tube. The present work can provide relevant information on the design of fluidized beds with internals. Moreover, the data gathered in this work can be used to validate the accuracy of 3D numerical models of gas-solid systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Numerical simulation and analysis of the influence of fracture geometry

AB Wormholes can effectively connect the fracture system as the dominant channels when carbonate matrix is acidified, thereby increasing the distance of acidification. It is critical to clarify the wormhole propagation law in carbonate reservoirs so as to optimize the acidification design. Previous studies highlight the influences of matrix as well as single simple fracture on wormhole propagation. However, the works characterizing impacts of single and multiple fractures with different geometry are insufficient. In this paper, the two-scale continuum model and pseudo-fracture model were combined to study the worm-hole with different fractures. It was found that the fractures parallel to injection direction can concentrate fluids and thus accelerate the acid penetrating the formation, while the perpendicular ones will disperse fluids, thereby slowing down the breakthrough. The effect of straight fractures and arc fractures on wormholes are similar. When the inclination angle is less than 60 degrees, straight fracture and arc fracture can be regarded as parallel fracture of corresponding length. When the inclination angle is greater than 60 degrees, they can be regarded as superposition of parallel fracture and perpendicular fracture. As for the circular and polygonal fractures, only the parts near the outlet impact the subsequent wormhole propagation trajectories. The analysis of flow field shows that there is a control domain of about 3.L.cos(theta) around the fractures. When there is no intersection of control domains of multiple fractures, there is no interference between them. There is no need to consider all fractures in the formation. Based on this, the step-by-step calculation method proposed in this paper is suitable for acidizing large-scale formation with complex fracture network. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Investigating the behavior of droplets impacting on stainless steel wire mesh is of great importance. Previous studies focused on the impact phenomena of a whole wire mesh, without detailed function of each composing unit. In this work, the impact on two basic units of the single fiber and the intersection of two crossing fibers was systemically investigated. The dispersion processes of the droplets were recorded by a high-speed camera at various conditions of the droplet velocities, initial droplet sizes, and impacted object shapes. Three dripping modes of one-drop, double-drop, and ligament were observed when droplets impact on one single fiber. Two disintegration modes of four-part and two part were found with crossing fibers. Correlations of the maximum spreading length of the droplet on the fiber of wire mesh were proposed, and the predicted values were in a good agreement with the experimental values. The mathematical models of the boundaries between different modes were established based on the force analysis of the droplet impacting on the mesh units. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mechanism of disintegration of agglomerates in a non-uniform electric field was studied experimentally and numerically. An external electric field was formed between an upper electrode made of wire mesh and a lower electrode comprising a metal plate. The dielectric particle layers on the lower electrode were charged by induction, and straight-chain agglomerates were formed on the surface of the particle layers by dipole interactions between the particles based on dielectric polarization. In the electric field, the charged agglomerates levitated under the influence of the Coulomb forces, and the charged agglomerates disintegrated with rotation when approaching the upper electrode. The experimental study and analysis of the numerical motion of the agglomerate showed that the charge distribution in the agglomerate generates torques around the centroid of the agglomerate in the non-uniform electric field around the upper electrode, and the centrifugal force acting on the rotating particles causes disintegration of the agglomerates.

AB MoS2 is a potential catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas obtained from different carbon-containing feedstock into methane, hydrocarbons and alcohols. We performed a combined density functional theory and microkinetics simulation study of all relevant reaction pathways of CO and H-2 into methane, ethylene, ethane, formaldehyde, methanol, carbon dioxide and water at the bare and partially sulfided Mo-edge of MoS2(1 0 0). Reaction barriers were substantially lower for the 25% sulfur-covered Mo-edge in comparison to the bare Mo-edge. H-assisted CO dissociation is preferred over direct CO dissociation for both surfaces. Microkinetics simulations predict a negligible methanation rate for the bare Moedge, which contradicts experiment. The discrepancy stems from oxygen poisoning of the surface. Oxygen removal barriers are substantially lowered at a sulfur coverage of 25%. The resulting CO conversion rate and product distribution are in good agreement with reported experimental data. These simulations show how density functional theory combined with microkinetics simulations can predict performance of catalytic surface used in complex chemical reactions. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Particle based approaches are one of the recent modeling techniques to overcome the computational limitation in multiscale modeling of complex processes, for example a heterogeneous catalytic reactor. We propose an efficient model for a chemical reactor where hydrodynamics of the solvent is determined by Stochastic Rotation Dynamics and a reaction occurs over a catalytic surface where the reaction kinetics follows the mean-field assumption. We highlight the modeling techniques required to simulate such a system and then validate the model for its separate and combined components of convection, diffusion and reaction(s). A dimensionless analysis helps compare processes occurring at different scales. We determine the Reynolds number, Re, and the Damkohler numbers, Da and Da(L) in terms of key quantities. The approach is then used to analyse a reaction (a) following the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, (b) generating product particles with different self-diffusivity values as compared to the reactant particles. The model developed can further incorporate reactions occurring inside complex geometries (pore diffusion) and also be used to study complex reaction systems for which the mean-field assumption is no longer valid.

AB This article reviews the general features of the multiscale structures in particle-fluid systems and the characterization, modeling, and simulation methods for these systems. The discussion focuses on the effects of mesoscale behavior, especially those present in process industries for materials and energy transformation and utilization. When there is substantial multiscale heterogeneity in these systems, local non-equilibrium and anisotropy generally lead to a lack of scale separation. Accurate and efficient simulation methods based on first principles and applied across different scales are highly desirable to reveal and quantify the complexities of these systems. Meanwhile, precisely designed experiments and exhaustive nonintrusive measurements are necessary to validate and expand the numerical findings. With this knowledge, rational mesoscale models can be established to provide multiscale simulation methods that do not need to fully reproduce the micro- and mesoscale details of the systems but can still take into account their effects on macroscales. Such multiscale methods are attractive for industrial applications but substantial effort in physical modeling and numerical implementation is still required before their widespread implementation.

AB The implementation of multicomponent diffusion in porous catalyst particles into resolved-particle fixed bed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) presents challenges. Usually an isotropic effective diffusivity is employed for each species, which includes molecular diffusion, Knudsen diffusion and viscous flow. To obtain this quantity, constant and isotropic molar flux ratios are assumed. In fixed bed models, pellets composed of isotropic materials are situated in non-isotropic fluid-phase gradients in the bed, which call the assumptions into question. In this paper we present an extended model using a non-isotropic effective diffusivity tensor, which allows evaluation of the flux assumptions. The method is illustrated for resolved particle steady-state CFD simulations of ethylene oxidation in small test beds of spheres and four-hole cylinders. Comparisons to the original constant molar flux ratio model are made, which show that the flux changes affect reaction, species and temperature profiles in the particles, and are stronger in particles with longer diffusion paths. Larger differences between results from the two diffusion models are also seen when the effective diffusivity is decreased by reducing porosity and increasing tortuosity, typical of a reaction system where deactivation increases by carbon deposition.

AB Luminescent nanoparticles have great potential for remote temperature sensing. Mapping of high temperature profiles under harsh conditions that are common in chemical reactors requires new thermally and chemically stable (nano)probes. Here, we report temperature dependent luminescence of Yb3+/Er3+-,Dy3+- and Eu3+-doped Y2O3 nanoparticles (NPs). We have deposited these lanthanide-doped Y2O3 NPs on alpha-Al2O3, a non-porous catalyst support material. The NPs are strongly adsorbed on the surface and no sintering was observed upon heating to 900 K for 12 h. The high chemical and thermal stability of Y2O3 makes these nanoprobes ideal for sensing in catalytic environments. A systematic study of the three types of luminescent NPs reveals that the temperature dependent luminescence of Yb3+/Er3+, Dy3+ and Eu3+ serves different temperature ranges: lower T regime (300-800 K, accuracy < 5 K) for Yb3+/Er3+, intermediate T for Dy3+(400-900 + K, accuracy < 15 K) and high T for Eu3+(550-900 + K, accuracy < 12 K). The superior thermal and chemical stability of the Y2O3/alpha-Al2O3 host in combination with different luminescent lanthanide dopants results in a robust system that can be tailored to monitor temperatures in different regimes with the highest possible sensitivity.

ID BEDS
AB We resolve dynamic species transport in a turbulent through-flow reactor by means of recurrence CFD (rCFD). In order to incorporate rCFD into a process control loop, the existing real-time simulation methodology (Pirker and Lichtenegger, 2018) has been further developed significantly.
   First and foremost, we propose an interpolation methodology which enables the representation of intermediate pseudo-periodic flows in-between two recurrence databases. Interpolated rCFD predictions agree very well with corresponding full CFD results with respect to mean concentration, concentration histograms as well as spatial line profiles and temporal point monitors of concentration. We further apply interpolated rCFD to unsteadily varying through-flow conditions, achieving consistently good predictions. Next, we considered reactive and non-isothermal flow. Still, rCFD predictions agree very well with full CFD simulations with respect to the unsteadily evolving fields of species concentration and temperature. At the same time rCFD simulations run four orders of magnitude faster than corresponding full CFD simulations, yielding faster-than-real-time predictions of the evolving concentration fields.
   This paves the way towards a rCFD-based process control, such that (1) a recurrence database is selected based on process dynamics before (2) point probe of passive scalars are extrapolated by rCFD to high-resolution field data, which are (3) reduced to descriptive scalars, serving for (4) process actuation.
   We prove the feasibility of rCFD-based process control for (i) outflow concentration control and for (ii) local hot-spot suppression. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Complex distribution of adsorbates can emerge in heterogeneous catalysis due to the compromise among different mechanisms (showing different tendencies of structural evolution) associated with different processes. On two-dimensional catalyst surfaces, all the surfaces are exposed to the gas reservoir (and thus adsorption and desorption processes are accessible to all the surfaces), and we have investigated the effects of adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and reactions on the adlayer structure, and revealed the mechanisms (Huang and Li, 2016). However, in zeolites, only the entrances (or exits) of the pore channels are exposed to the gas reservoir (and thus adsorption and desorption processes are limited there), so the mesoscale behavior might be somewhat different. In this work we explore the influence of adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and reactions on the adsorbate distribution in the ZSM-5 zeolite using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Complex distributions of adsorbates (nonlinearly gradient, showing apparent adsorbate shells in some cases) have been revealed, and the channel utilization has been evaluated. The approach and results might be useful to catalyst design, especially determining the optimal thickness of zeolite on a catalyst particle (pellet), since the channel utilization is a measure of effective fraction of the catalyst and is correlated with the practical efficiency of catalysis.

AB In this work we study the heat transport in inhomogeneous bubbly flow. The experiments were performed in a rectangular bubble column heated from one side wall and cooled from the other, with millimetric bubbles introduced through one half of the injection section (close to the hot wall or close to the cold wall). We characterise the global heat transport while varying two parameters: the gas volume fraction alpha= 0.4-5.1%, and the Rayleigh number Ra-H= 4 x 10(9)- 2.2 x 10(10). As captured by imaging and characterised using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA), different flow regimes occur with increasing gas flow rates. In the generated inhomogeneous bubbly flow there are three main contributions to the mixing: (i) transport by the buoyancy driven recirculation, (ii) bubble induced turbulence (BIT) and (iii) shear-induced turbulence (SIT). The strength of these contributions and their interplay depends on the gas volume fraction which is reflected in the measured heat transport enhancement. We compare our results with the findings for heat transport in homogeneous bubbly flow from Gvozdic et al. (2018). We find that for the lower gas volume fractions (alpha < 4%), inhomogeneous bubbly injection results in better heat transport due to induced large-scale circulation. In contrast, for alpha > 4%, when the contribution of SIT becomes stronger, but so does the competition between all three contributions, the homogeneous injection is more efficient.

AB Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is considered one of the most promising routes to directly convert methane into more valuable hydrocarbons. The uncertain economics related to the tradeoff between conversion and C-2 selectivities is the primary reason why OCM is currently not industrially applied. In the last decades, numerous studies have focused on developing a viable catalyst that has the potential to improve the low C-2 yields. But is the primary issue of OCM truly a catalyst problem? Because of the high exothermicity of the OCM process, thermal effects and path dependence are dominating in all OCM reactors of practical importance. Furthermore, irreducible diffusion limitations exist on the pellet scale. Understanding how to exploit these mass and heat transfer effects by reactor engineering is a prerequisite for the breakthrough of OCM. In this work an overview is given of criteria used to assess mass and heat transfer resistances, parametric sensitivity and runaway in catalytic packed bed reactors. The importance of mass transport limitations, runaway and/or ignition for OCM, either on the pellet scale or on the reactor scale, is shown in several examples. Both simple and advanced reactor concepts are discussed with a focus on their heat and mass transfer characteristics. Clear progress has been made in the past lustrum on all these fronts and it seems that research is on the verge of a real breakthrough to make OCM happen on an industrial scale.

AB In this work we have performed an extensive CFD simulation campaign with the purpose of studying particle transport and deposition in different catalytic systems and under different conditions. Two types of geometric models representing different porous media were created. The first is a number of random packings of spheres created via rigid body simulations: this approach was tested in previous studies and was proved to result in realistic packings, validated in their geometric features and fluid dynamic behaviour. The second is a regular arrangement of spheres, which was also successfully employed in previous works to study fine particles dispersion.
   Using these random packings, simulations of particle deposition have been performed at different operating conditions. In the first part we calculated values of particle deposition efficiency and compared our results with the classical filtration theory, highlighting the criticalities in the use of the simplified models upon which the theory is based. In the second part we have studied the effect of polydisperse particle populations: this is also missing in the classical filtration theory, which always considers the transport of particles with uniform diameter. Thus, we have performed population balance modelling simulations for particle deposition, employing the quadrature method of moments (QMOM): as an accompanying technical addition, a study on the accuracy of the application of EQMOM in these systems is offered. Even more clearly in this case, the results show that the description of polydisperse populations has a very noticeable effect on the macro-scale description, which would dramatically improve the understanding of particle transport and deposition in filtration and catalytic processes.

AB The development of novel technologies to convert renewable biomass feedstocks to fuels and chemicals is of increasing interest for making our chemical industry more sustainable. Plant biomass or its biomass-derived platform molecules are typically over-functionalized, requiring substantial modification to produce the chemicals currently demanded by industry. Furanic compounds are intermediates in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass or sugar dehydration and can in principle be further converted to aromatics. While upgrading of furanics by zeolite-catalysed aromatization typically results in a large loss of carbon due to coke deposition, carbon laydown can be mitigated by the addition of ethylene and by the modification of the zeolite with Lewis acid Ga sites. Here, we investigate the influence of the Ga loading on the physicochemical properties of Ga-modified HZSM-5 zeolite and its performance in the gas-phase aromatization of 2,5-dimethylfuran with ethylene. Characterization of the morphological, textural and acidic properties were carried out to understand the role of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites on the catalytic reaction. We demonstrate a crucial role of the dispersion of Ga-species and the resulting Lewis acidity of the Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts; and show means how to control both parameters by adjusting the synthesis method.

AB In this paper two immersed boundary methods (IBM), specifically a continuous forcing method (CFM) and a discrete forcing method (DFM), are applied to perform direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of heat transfer problems in tubular fluid-particle systems. Both IBM models are built on the well-developed models utilized in momentum transfer studies, and have the capability to handle mixed boundary conditions at the particle surface as encountered in industrial applications with both active and passive particles.
   Following a thorough verification of both models for the classical Graetz-Nusselt problem, we subsequently apply them to study a much more advanced Graetz-Nusselt problem of more practical importance with a dense stationary array consisting of hundreds of particles randomly positioned inside a tube with adiabatic wall. The influence of particle sizes and fractional amount of passive particles is analyzed at varying Reynolds numbers, and the simulation results are compared between the two IBM models, finding good agreement. Our results thus qualify the two employed IBM modules for more complex applications. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We suggest a reactive Sherwood number model for convective mass transfer around reactive particles in a dilute regime. The model is constructed with a simple external-internal coupling and is validated with Particle-Resolved Simulation (PRS). The PRS of reactive particle-fluid systems requires numerical methods able to handle efficiently sharp gradients of concentration and potential discontinuities of gradient concentrations at the fluid-particle interface. To simulate mass transfer from reactive catalyst beads immersed in a fluid flow, we coupled the Sharp Interface Method (SIM) to a Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictions Domain (DLM/FD) two-phase flow solver. We evaluate the accuracy of our numerical method by comparison to analytic solutions and to generic test cases fully resolved by boundary fitted simulations. A previous theoretical model that couples the internal diffusion-reaction problem with the external advection-diffusion mass transfer in the fluid phase is extended to the configuration of three aligned spherical particles representative of a dilute particle-laden flow. Predictions of surface concentration, mass transfer coefficient and chemical effectiveness factor of catalyst particles are validated by DLM-FD/SIM simulations. We show that the model captures properly the effect of an internal first order chemical reaction on the overall respective reactive Sherwood number of each sphere depending on their relative positions. The proposed correlation for the reactive Sherwood number is based on an existing non-reactive Sherwood number correlation. The model can be later used in Euler/Lagrange or Euler/ Euler modelling of dilute reactive particle-laden flows. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We report a defect-engineered Co-based solid catalyst, namely the CO3O4 nanocubes (NCs)/graphitic C3N4(g-C3N4) hybrid, for enhancing the oxidation of magnesium sulfite (MgSO3) in the desulfurization of wet magnesia. Abundant oxygen vacancies were induced successfully on the CO3O4 NCs/g-C3N4 hybrid. The creation of oxygen vacancies promoted MgSO3 oxidation by enhancing the adsorption of reactant MgSO3 and accelerating the striping of product MgSO4 to refresh the Co active sites. The oxygen vacancies also promoted the transfer of oxygen molecules and subsequent activation of oxygen molecules to active oxygen species. The size effect of CO3O4 NCs, which may be a crucial factor for improving the catalytic activity, considerably enhanced the efficiency of Co species. Moreover, because the g-C3N4 support had a large surface area and large number of unpaired electrons, the coupling of CO3O4 NCs and g-C3N4 improved the dispersion of CO3O4 NCs, which substantially decreased the usage of Co species. During the MgSO3 oxidation reaction, the hybrid catalyst exhibited an unprecedented MgSO4 yield per Co site of 1678.9 mmol/mmol Co at 30 min and a rapid MgSO3 oxidation rate of 0.068 mmol.L (1).s (1).

AB Within this contribution liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and precipitation from ethanol was studied as an approach to produce polyamide 11 (PA11) powders for selective laser sintering (SLS). To this end, the cloud point and solution temperature curve of the PAll-ethanol system was determined experimentally via turbidity measurements. The proper range of system composition and temperature for particle formation was deduced. The dependence of particle characteristics on process parameters (polymer concentration, stirring conditions and temperature regime) during LLPS and precipitation was assessed and the products were characterized with respect to their size and morphology. Furthermore, structural, rheological and thermal characteristics were analyzed and correlated with process parameters. Molecular weight distributions were determined. After removal of fines and dry coating with hydrophobic fumed silica, an optimized PA11 powder with mean particle size of 91 mu m showing good flowability for SLS was obtained. SLS processability of this optimized PA11 powder was demonstrated by building multilayered test specimens in a laser sintering machine. With this contribution, we present a comprehensive workflow for the process development, product characterization and product application of a SLS powder manufactured via precipitation.

AB The present study investigated the mechanism of small bubble breakup in an unbaffled vessel stirred by a 4-blade paddle impeller. Bubbles were injected underneath the rotating blades. Numerical simulation and experimental observations were performed to investigate the related phenomena. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method was utilized to simulate a gas-liquid multiphase flow. The injected bubbles were broken behind the impeller blade, where they were transported due to a decreasing pressure gradient caused by the impeller rotation. At the behind of the blade, bubbles were elongated and fragmented due to the trailing vortices developing from the rear surface of blade. The fragmented bubbles were entrapped at the cores of trailing vortices, and then floated up in the space where the trailing vortices became weak. The size of the broken bubbles was dependent on the impeller rotation rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of the carrier and the content of the active species were studied in the carbon monoxide oxidation process. MnOx catalysts supported on ZrO2, CeO2, MgO, SiO2, and Al2O3 were prepared and characterized by XRD, BET-BJH, FE-SEM, EDX, TPR, and CO2-TPD analyses. The relation between the textural properties of the catalysts and the catalytic performance was investigated. The results showed that Mn/CeO2 catalyst despite of its lowest surface area (55.5 m(2)/g) possessed the highest activity among other catalysts. High ability to supply oxygen through the support during the reaction is the most important reason for the proper performance of this catalyst. The investigation of the Mn content indicated that the 20 wt% Mn/CeO2 showed high dispersion, appropriate reducibility and the highest concentration of active sites compared to other catalysts with various Mn contents. The temperature corresponding to 50% of the CO conversion (T-50) was about 142 degrees C, which was 20 degrees C lower than the other samples. In addition, the influence of different parameters including pretreatment condition, feed ratio, and GHSV was examined on the catalytic performance. The results showed that the catalytic stability declined with the incorporation of water vapor and CO2 in the feed mixture. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rayleigh convection has a significant effect on gas-liquid interfacial mass transfer. However, its intensified mechanism has not been clarified so far. In the present work, three-dimensional hybrid Lattice Boltzmann Method-Finite Difference Method (LBM-FDM) was employed to simulate the Rayleigh convection emerging in the CO2-ethanol absorption process. A gas phase random disturbance model was applied to represent the disturbances on the gas-liquid interface which effectively induces Rayleigh convection. Then the front view images obtained by three-dimensional simulation were compared to the Schlieren observations for validation. Finally, a theoretical mass transfer coefficient model based on dissipation rate of concentration variance was proposed, by analyzing the overhead view of concentration contour and dissipation rate of concentration variance contour. Compared to the small eddy model and surface divergence model, the proposed model shows its strength in determining molecular diffusion stage and convective mass transfer stage of Rayleigh convection process, as well as eliminating the phase difference in model prediction.

AB Particle velocity distribution function (PVDF) is key to kinetic theory of granular flow. Studies have shown that the PVDFs in gas-solid flow can be Maxwellian, bimodal and/or non-Maxwellian with an overpopulated high-energy tail. In this short communication, topography analysis was carried out to elucidate the mathematical nature of bimodal distribution. It was shown that both of the non-Maxwellian distribution with an overpopulated high-energy tail and the Maxwellian distribution are special cases of bimodal distribution, therefore, bimodal distribution can be used as the starting point of developing a unified kinetic theory for gas-solid flow. Furthermore, the constrained conditions for the transition from bimodal distribution to the non-Maxwellian distribution with an overpopulated high-energy tail were identified. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The primary aim of this study us to develop an integrated PV/T-photoelectrochemical-chloralkali (PEC-chloralkali) system with multigeneration benefits and evaluate its thermodynamic performance. The key component of the integrated system is the continuous type hybrid H-2 generation reactor, which is also referred to as PEC-chloralkali reactor. The hybrid reactor is capable of converting the byproducts of H-2 production into valuable products for the industry. In addition to hydrogen, the hybrid reactor can produce Cl-2 and NaOH simultaneously. The reason behind using the hybrid reactor together with PV/T in an integrated system is to maximize solar spectrum utilization by combining the advantages of the photoelectrochemical system and PV/T. The electrodes are used as electron donors to drive the photoelectrochemical reaction in the hybrid reactor. As a result, the need for additional chemicals is eliminated and the risk of any potentially harmful waste streams is minimized. The integrated system has five useful products which are hydrogen and chlorine gases, sodium hydroxide solution, heat, and electricity. The performance of the system is evaluated based on hydrogen, chlorine, heat, and electricity production rates, energy and exergy efficiencies, and exergy destruction rates at different ambient temperatures and with different total photoactive area sizes. It is seen that the present innovative hybrid multigenerational system is capable of producing 8.9 g/h H-2 and 244 g/h Cl-2 at energy and exergy efficiencies about 86% and 29%, respectively.

AB In this study, an efficient sequential chromatographic process for recovering hydroxy acids (HAs) from soda and kraft black liquors (BLs) has been developed. Lignin and pulping chemicals are also recovered and can be recycled back to the pulping process. A weak cation exchange resin in Na+ form separates lignin from BL. Up to 95% lignin yield was obtained, with over 50% yield for HAs as Na salts. A cellulosebased resin is used to separate HAs from NaOH. Complete separation, and thus 100% yield for HAs and NaOH, was achieved. The HAs in soda BL are liberated by ion exchange. In case of kraft BL, the solution is acidified with H2SO4 and subjected to ion exchange and ion exclusion chromatography to recover the remaining pulping chemicals. It was found that fouling, which limits the efficiency of membrane-based processing of BLs, is avoided with the appropriate choice of chromatographic separation materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, we present a mathematical model to describe the adsorption-diffusion process on fractal porous materials. This model is based on the fractal continuum approach and considers the scale-invariant properties of the surface and volume of adsorbent particles, which are well-represented by their fractal dimensions. The method of lines was used to solve the nonlinear fractal model, and the numerical predictions were compared with experimental data to determine the fractal dimensions through an optimization algorithm. The intraparticle mass flux and the mean square displacement dynamics as a function of fractal dimensions were analyzed. The results suggest that they can be potentially used to characterize the intraparticle mass transport processes. The fractal model demonstrated to be able to predict adsorption-diffusion experiments and jointly can be used to estimate fractal parameters of porous adsorbents. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
