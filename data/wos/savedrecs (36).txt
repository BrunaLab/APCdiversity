AB In this letter, the W18O49@Carbon Clothes (W18O49@CC) were synthesis via a simple microwave-assistant solvothermal method for the first time. The W18O49 nanowires were in-suit grown on the surface of CC and wrapped closely, exhibiting high photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation than that of pure W18O49. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of W18O49@CC can be ascribed to the unique structure which was the main enhanced mechanism in photodegradation process. Due to the lightweight flexible CC substrate, the photocatalysts will be floating on the surface of the water, which can increase not only the contact area with the solar radiation in the practical application but also easy-recycle to avoid secondary pollution. This work gives evidence of the W18O49@CC holds a great potential in photocatalytic applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photo-cross linking copolymer Poly (2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-2-(Dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate-co-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin methacrylate) (PHDC)) was first synthesized by free radical polymerization of 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin methacrylate (CA), 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMA). Then, the copolymers were self-assembled into colloidal particles and immobilized on the NiTi alloy by a simple one-step electrophoretic deposition. After irradiation, a photo-crosslinked coating was obtained. The structure and morphology were characterized by OCA and SEM. The copolymer coatings could significantly decrease the release of nickel ions into the environment and reduce cytotoxicity inducing by nickel ions according to immersion experiment. Meanwhile, the coatings have good cytocompatibility. This work provides a simpler polymer coating method to inhibit the release of toxic ions by inducing ion adsorption with certain molecular structures, which have potential for biomedical applications such as artificial bone and bone fixation device.

AB Here we report a dramatically enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst by acid etched MoS2 (A-MoS2). For the etching and oxidation effects of HNO3, the active site and electrical transport are significantly improved by simply controlling of processing time. The A-MoS2 exhibits promising electrocatalytic performance, including much smaller onset overpotential (similar to 80 mV), an overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), and a Tafel slope of 97 mV/dec (the pristine MoS2 180 mV/dec). The enhanced HER performance of MoS2 may be attributed to the increased edge S atoms and the charge induced by the O doping. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, Ag-decorated apatite nanosheet-coated silica nanofibers (Ag-Ap-Si NFs) with enhanced anti-bacterial and photo-catalytic properties were synthesized through incubation of apatite nanosheet-coated silica nanofibers (Ap-Si NFs) in the suspension of chitosan-stabilized Ag nanoparticles (NPs). SEM observations showed that Ag-Ap-Si NFs had the diameter of 840-2340 nm and possessed a hierarchical structure. TEM observations showed the surface of Ag-Ap-Si NFs was constructed by the composites of apatite nanosheets with the thickness around 10 nm and Ag NPs with the size of 5-20 nm. It was found that Ag-Ap-Si NFs showed enhanced anti-bacterial property to inhibit the growth of both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and superior photo-catalytic activity for reduction of 4-nitrophenol in the presence of NaBH4. The present Ag-Ap-Si NFs would be applicable as multi-functional materials with both photo-catalytic and anti-bacterial properties for wastewater treatment at weak acidic and basic pH.

AB The space charge characteristics of insulation paper are crucial under direct current. Thus, improving the space charge behavior of insulation paper is essential. In this study, a nanostructure AlOx film was coated on the surface of insulation paper via RF magnetron sputtering. The space charge distribution was measured using a pulsed electroacoustic instrument. After coating with nanostructure AlOx film, the calculated characteristics showed that space charge accumulation in the samples decreased, and the trap density on the surface of the insulation paper also decreased. Results showed that using the nanostructure AlOx film to improve the space charge performance of insulation paper was feasible and effective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Martensite stabilization in Ni-Mn-Ga and Ni-Mn-Sn single crystals was induced by mechanical training. The degree of stabilization differs between Ni-Mn-Ga and Ni-Mn-Sn (AT=28 K), what is attributed to a disparity in the twinning stress affecting also transformation morphology. Upon martensitic transformation multiple site nucleation is favoured by a larger twinning stress in Ni-Mn-Sn in contrast to a planar phase front movement in Ni-Mn-Ga. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Structure, optical and morphology were tuned with respect to the temperature. Four different structures such as intermediate, mixed or polycrystalline, tetragonal and cubic were prepared. The absorption edge of the tetragonal MAPbI(3) was located at about 850 nm, indicating that the band gap of MAPbI(3) is approximately 1.48 eV, which is close to the theoretical results and smaller than those derived from polycrystalline and thin-films. MAPbI(3) powder exhibits relatively wide absorption (from 250 nm to 850 nm) and good thermal stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fibrous membranes with low infrared emissivity hold promises in applications as infrared stealth uniforms, backpacks and tents due to their lightweight, flexibility and versatility, etc. By electrospinning technology, fibrous membranes of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and PVDF modified with single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) (named as SWNT/PVDF) are prepared. The membranes of PVDF and SWNT/ PVDF are further decorated with Au nanoparticle, and are named as Au-PVDF and Au-SWNT/PVDF. The infrared emissivity of the films is characterized at the range of 2-22 mu m wavelengths. The infrared emissivity value is in the descending order, being 0.82, 0.77, 0.76, and 0.68 for PVDF, SWNT/PVDF, Au-PVDF, and Au-SWNT/PVDF films. The results indicate the effectiveness of Au decoration on the reduction of infrared emissivity for PVDF or SWNT/PVDF fibrous membranes, rendering its probable application in infrared stealth camouflage.

AB Cathodic polarization antifouling has attracted attention because of environment-friendly property. We have developed a conductive PPy/resin coating with good electrochemical antifouling effects. However, its conductivity should be further improved to save the electric energy. In this work, a conductive Ag@PPy/resin composite was synthesized. Compared to PPy/resin coating, its conductivity was increased by 6 times, besides, its stability and 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity were obviously enhanced. And the antifouling effect under smaller cathodic voltage (-0.3 V) is improved, increasing the anti-fouling efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A benign dicarboxylic cellulose/silica hybrid was synthesized through periodate-chlorite oxidation of cellulose followed by in-situ silica network formation through sol-gel process. The crosslinked 2, 3 dicarboxylic cellulose/silica hybrid showed a homogenous morphology and the internal structure shows rodlike structure for 2, 3 dicarboxylic cellulose with similar to 5 nm in width. The current hybrid was investigated as a new adsorbent for methylene blue (MB) adsorption from aqueous solutions. The adsorption data were best represented by pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption is 526 mg/g according to Langmuir fitting. The obtained results suggested potential applications of dicarboxylic cellulose/silica hybrid for the efficient removal of MB from contaminated wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such constructions are developed and employed in ethanol gas detection. The measured results reveal that the hollow NiO/ZnO hierarchical heterostructure based sensor exhibits outstanding ethanol gas sensing performances with superior gas response and excellent repeatability, which are predominantly ascribed to the hierarchical hollow architectures as well as the formation of p-n heterojunction at the interface between the p-type NiO and n-type ZnO structures.

AB There is an immense push for the development of innovative, convenient and high-performance organic electronics. In this study, we present the synthesis of two azines and the exploration of their photophysical, surface morphological, electrochemical and electroluminescence properties for application in organic electronic devices. A diphenol substituted azine, 2,2'-[hydrazine-1,2-diylidenedimethylylidene]diphenol was synthesized by re fluxing ethanolic solution of hydrazine hydrate with ethyl 2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxylate. It was then converted into an azine spacer incorporated new tetrazo dye, bis-[2-(iminomethyl)-4-(phenyl diazenyl)phenol] by coupling with benzenediazonium chloride. The structures of the symmetrical azines were confirmed by FT-IR, NMR and mass spectroscopic techniques. Both the azines in thin film states exhibited deep yellow photoluminescence on UV excitation at 570 nm. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels assessed by cyclic voltammetry measurements, conformed to the electrochemical band gap energies of 4.41-4.55 eV. The p-type conductivity of the azines were confirmed by hot probe technique. The transport properties of both the azines were investigated by fabricating a bi-layer device. The successful construction of diodes with azines suggest that they could play a significant role as organic materials in the construction of electronic devices.

AB Transition metal dichalcogenides, such as monolayer MoS2 and WS2, can be easily transferred onto or integrated with various substrates, and are therefore promising on-chip light sources. Although are direct-bandgap materials with more efficient optical gain compared to indirect band-gap materials such as silicon, they are more sensitive to the surrounding environment and substrate materials than bulk direct-bandgap semiconductors. Herein, the photoluminescence intensity of WS2 transferred onto silicon nitride is demonstrated to be tunable and substantially enhanced by violet laser excitation, owing to irradiation-induced chemical doping with atmospheric moisture and oxygen, which lead to changes in the densities of neutral excitons and trions; this process is reversible in vacuum conditions. However, with continuous excitation, WS2 with trapped molecules is more easily damaged by laser irradiation than bulk semiconductors. Upon coating with Al2O3, the stability of WS2 under laser irradiation is enhanced. We show that the isolation of WS2 from air can extend the lifetime of transition metal dichalcogenides on chip-communication devices. The results of this study indicate that further optimization is required to realize practical on-chip applications of these monolayer materials as light sources.

AB Designed, synthesized and characterized here two thiophene dyes 3-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)-2-(thiophen-2-yl) acrylonitrile (ET), 3-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)-2-(thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile (PT) along with their -CHO substituted derivatives 3-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)-2-(5-formylthiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile (ET-CHO) and 3-(4-((4-formylphenyl) (phenyl)amino)phenyl)-2-(5-formylthiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile (PT-2CHO) for optoelectronic devices towards protecting human eyes and optical sensors, as well as for stabilizing light sources in optical communications. Using the open aperture Z-scan method in tandem with linear absorption spectroscopy, emission spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the nonlinear absorption and optical limiting behavior under nanosecond (5 ns) Nd: YAG laser excitation at 532 nm wavelength was demonstrated. The observed nonlinearity in all the samples was found to be arising from two-photon absorption process. The DFT calculations at a B3LYP/6-31G(d) level for the geometry optimization have shown that the HOMO levels of ET and PT dyes are delocalized throughout the molecule, while for ET-CHO and PT-2CHO dyes, they occupy all over the molecule except -CHO group present on thiophene ring. Also, LUMO levels are delocalized through the aromatic bridge and shift towards thiophene ring for all dyes. This change in the band structure has tuned the effective nonlinear absorption coefficients (beta(eff)) and PT-CHO possesses a maximum value of beta(eff) = 2.9 x 10(-11) m/W. The excellent optical limiting performance of these chromophores makes them useful in photonic or optoelectronic devices for protecting human eyes and optical sensors, as well as for stabilizing light sources in optical communications.

AB Eu3+-doped tricalcium silicate (Ca3SiO5) was synthesized by two-step precipitation and combinated calcination method. The samples were investigated before and after soaking in dilute K2HPO4 aqueous solution for different times using X-ray diffraction method (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray energy-dispersive spectra (EDS). The optical properties of as-prepared and mineralized samples were evaluated using luminescence spectroscopy respectively. The results showed that, with prolonged soaking time, Eu3+-doped tricalcium silicate gradually transformed into hydroxyapatite and showed good bioactivity. Meanwhile, the luminescence intensity of Eu3+ ion gradually decreased; the intensity ratio between electric dipole transition (D-5(0)-> F-7(2)) and magnetic dipole transition (D-5(0)-> F-7(1)) increased; the emitting color of mineralized samples under UV-lamp and its CIE coordinates changed from orange-red to deep-violet. These phenomena revealed that the mineralization of Eu3+-doped Ca3SiO5 can be monitored through the evolution of optical properties with prolonged soaking time.

AB Perovskite material presents prospective application potential in the third generation solar cell for their broad spectral absorption, small exciton binding energy and long exciton diffusion length. In this paper, low temperature and stable mixed-cation perovskite FA(x)MA(1-x)PbI(3) solar cells fabrication method in air ambient was reported. The inverted planar ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FA(x)MA(1-x)PbI(3)/PCBM/Ag structure was fabricated in air ambient, which shows better performance than either FAPbI(3) or MAPbI(3) devices, and FA(0.4)MA(0.6)PbI(3) demonstrates the highest PCE of 9.7% among the FA(x)MA(1-x)PbI(3) solar cell devices. In order to decrease the potential barrier between the PCBM and Ag electrode, a layer of Bphen was inserted between PCBM and Ag electrode, the PCE of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FA(x)MA(1-x)PbI(3)/PCBM/Bphen/Ag perovskite solar cell was increased to 10.86%. We simulated and calculated the absorption and band energy of perovskite materials to verify the accuracy of experimental results. Our result provides a progress towards fabricating perovskite solar cells in the air ambient.

AB Nano structures of MoS2 are trending up as a smart optoelectronic material nowadays. Photoluminescence, linear and non-linear optical properties of highly crystalline MoS2 quantum dot (QD)-nano flake (NF) colloidal dispersion in de-ionized water prepared by cost effective mechanical grinding assisted bath ultrasonication and centrifugation is reported in this article. Particle size, which varies with the sonication time and centrifuging speed, is confirmed by TEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. The absorbance spectra show characteristic A, B, C and D excitonic transitions of NFs and high energy E peaks of QDs. MoS2 QD-NF dispersion exhibits appreciable photon upconversion and down conversion photoluminescence (PL) that are applicable to solar cells. The photoluminescence emission red shifts with red shift in excitation wavelength. Time correlated fluorescence decay measurement estimates the life time and it varies with the particle size. Raman spectra of spin coated MoS2 dispersion confirm the hexagonal structure and formation of few layered MoS2 in-plane (E-2g(1) and out-of-plane (A(1g)) vibrational modes. Selective area diffraction patterns confirm the crystallinity and hexagonal nature of the grown nanostructures. Non-linear optical studies of the samples exhibit reverse saturable absorption (RSA) which is applicable to optical limiting devices.

AB Long afterglow phosphors Ca2SnO4:Tb3+, Li+ with a green light were successfully synthesized by solid-state reaction, and their phase composition and luminescent property also studied using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL) and afterglow decay measurement. The results show that adding a small amount of Li+ ions does not have a significant effect on the crystal structure of Ca2SnO4:Tb3+, and that Ca2SnO4:Tb3+, Li+ samples are single phase of solid solutions. Their luminescent properties are strongly dependent on Li+ doping modes. The distortion of host lattice and change of the local crystal field symmetry around Tb3+ enhanced their emission intensity, while the formation of oxygen vacancy and the suitable depth traps improved their afterglow performance; but the association of interstitial Li+ (Li-i) with Ca2+ vacancy (V ''(ca)), and excessive Li+ ions would worsen their phosphorescence. Their afterglow mechanism was proposed.

AB Highly transparent Yb:YAG laser ceramics with various Yb3+ doping level were successfully fabricated through vacuum sintering of co-precipitated powders in combination with the hot isostatic pressing process. The effects of various Yb3+ dopant concentrations (1-15 at.%) on the photoluminescence, terahertz absorption and optical characteristics of Yb:YAG transparent ceramics were investigated. Characterizations of the Near-IR photo-luminescence emission and kinetics of the Yb:YAG ceramics revealed the corresponding F-2(5/2) -> F-2(7/2) characteristic bands of Yb3+ and the lifetime enhanced with increasing Yb3+ dopant concentrations, confirming no concentration quenching effect in Yb:YAG. Measurements of terahertz absorption properties of Yb:YAG transparent ceramics by a time-domain spectroscopy evidenced that both the cutoff frequency and terahertz absorption coefficient of Yb:YAG samples depended upon the Yb3+ dopant concentrations. The underlying mechanisms by which such Yb3+ dopant concentrations affected the terahertz absorption and optical properties were also discussed. The optical attenuation loss values were measured at 1064 nm for all the samples, to be similar to 0.030 cm(-1), a value close to that observed for single crystal.

AB Optical spectra (absorption, luminescence, decay of emission, spectra with time resolution) of Sm2+ ions in alkaline-earth fluoride crystals (CaF2, SrF2, BaF2) in the wavelength range 120-900 nm at 7-300 K were studied. By additive coloration of about 60% of the original Sm3+ is converted to Sm2+
   One component of the decay of the Sm2+ emission was observed in BaF2 crystals with a lifetime of 16 ms (a slow component) and in CaF2 crystals with a lifetime of 1.3 mu s (fast component) at low temperature. In SrF2 crystals, two decay of luminescence components are found in the millisecond and nanosecond time range. The luminescence spectra of the slow and fast components in CaF2, SrF2, BaF2 are similar, which confirms their attribution to forbidden 4f-4f and allowed 5d-4f transitions, respectively. The results obtained made it possible to clarify the position of the excited levels of Sm2+ 4f(D-5(0)) and 5d(e(g)) relative to the bottom of the conduction band of alkaline-earth fluorides.

AB Cadmium sulfide (CdS) has been investigated extensively for II generation solar cell as an efficient window layer with n type conductivity. The significance of CdS is because of its large energy band gap tune-ability and native n-type conductivity. In this report, energy band gap engineering of CdS films was carried out by means of controlled silver (Ag) doping to modify their optical properties along with electrical properties. Closed space sublimation (CSS) technique has been employed to synthesize as-deposited CdS thin films. One of the advantages of CSS grown films is roughness which offers more trapping/absorbing of light. Ion exchange solution process was carried out for Ag-doping, which resulted in widening of the band gap from 2.15 eV to a value of 2.45 eV, showing the increased capability of solar energy harvesting. Un-doped CdS thin films showed a high resistivity of the order of similar to 10(6) Omega-cm, which reduced to only similar to 10(2) Omega-cm with the Ag-doping, as probed by four-point probe, offering great advantage for the system to be used in II-VI solar cells. Un-doped and Ag-doped films showed n type conductivity. We studied the Ag-doping effects on the surface morphological and correlated the morphological modification with changing optical and electrical behaviour of CdS thin films. It is believed that enhanced properties offer great potential for these films to be used for the solar cell applications.

AB We investigated mechanical and optical properties of a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film through a flat punched indentation experiment and a finite element simulation. A microscopic imaging method was used to measure the compressive strain of thin PDMS films, and its corresponding bulk refractive index (RI) was estimated using the relation between density and refractive index. A total internal reflection (TIR) experiment was conducted to estimate the local RI values near the bottom surface of PDMS film. We obtained the correlations between force and indentation displacement in thin PDMS films (10-70 micron). Stress-strain curves present the non-linear deformation of PDMS film with the instantaneous modulus depending on the load and the thickness. Poisson's ratio of PDMS film is estimated by fitting with Yang's asymptotic solution and is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio between the radius of the flat punch probe and the film thickness. RI of PDMS film increases with the decreasing film thickness as well as the increasing load. The bulk RI was increased up to 1.476 by the compressing load while the bottom-surface RI was increased only up to 1.435. This difference is explained qualitatively through the localized stress-strain distribution from finite element analysis. An inhomogeneous stress-strain distribution is observed in the simulation with lower strain at the bottom of the film, corresponding to experiment. A lower strain leads to lower local density resulting in a lower refractive index. Our research provides fundamental insights into the correlation between mechanical and optical properties of thin polymer films.

AB The atomic structure and electronic properties of Mn3+ and Mn2+ ions substituted for the host Al at YAlO3 have been studied from the first principles. The 2 x 2 x 2 supercell adopted for the bulk crystal phase of Pbnm symmetry allows us to simulate substitutional point defect with concentration of about 3%. To perform ab initio modeling of Mn-doped YAlO3 we were using approach of hybrid exchange-correlation functional HSE within density functional theory. We predict a decrease of the Mn-O bond covalency in the doped crystal with respect to the Al-O bond of ideal orthorhombic YAlO3. Relatively large displacement of Y and Al atoms nearest to the F-0-center inserted to stabilize the Mn2+ ion of Mn:YAlO3 (0.17 angstrom towards the defect) influences the YAlO3 electronic structure. This leads to the presence of energy levels in the band gap of Mn-doped YAlO3. The F-ccnter attracts similar to 0.54 e, while the rest electron density from the missing O2- is localized mostly on the closest Mn2+ dopant.

The results showed that almost all slurries containing TEOS and TEOS + MgO had a near-Newtonian behavior, but the slurry containing only MgO had shear thickening with a thixotropic behavior. Also, by increasing the amounts of TEOS, due to the creation of steric repulsion, the viscosity was decreased. In comparison, TEOS + MgO slurries had lower viscosity than the TEOS ones. This was due to both the release of more ethanol and MgO action as a dispersant agent among the particles of yttria and alumina. All samples were pure YAG phase. The maximum transmittance at 1064 nm (approximate to 83%) was obtained for the sample of 0.5 wt% TEOS + 0.1 wt% MgO. A nearly pore-free microstructure with high relative final density (99.99%), a narrow grain size distribution (2.5-7.5 mu m), with the average grain size of 4.5 mu m, was achieved in this sample.

AB Novel ZnWO4 thin films were achieved by annealing sandwich WO3/ZnO/WO3 (WZW) heterolayer that were deposited on clean fused silica substrates by RF magnetron sputtering technique. The crystal structures, surface morphologies and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the annealed WZW heterolayers were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and PL measurements. The XRD and Raman patterns show that the ZnWO4 thin films formed from WZW heterolayers possess the monoclinic wolframite structure with a preferential orientation along the a-axis. The annealing temperature of WZW heterolayer plays a vital role in determining the crystallization, surface morphologies and PL properties of the formed ZnWO4 films. The SEM graphs and PL spectra indicate that the annealing treatment at about 750 degrees C for 30min is very effective for deposited WZW heterolayer to form the flat ZnWO4 thin film with the regular nanometer grains (200-400 nm) and the strongest PL emission near about 495 nm, while further increasing annealing temperature to 850 degrees C leads to a rough surface and weakened PL intensity. The PL spectra from all the annealed WZW films display a broad and asymmetrical shape and are depend on the excitation wavelengths in the range of 240-290 nm as well as annealing temperature. The related PL mechanisms were analyzed and discussed according to the excitation spectra monitored at 410 nm and 495 nm, respectively. It is suggested that the coexistence of the ZnWO4 and ZnO excitation bands in the film should be responsible for the evolving of PL shapes with the excitation wavelengths. Finally, the average PL decay time of the formed ZnWO4 film was determined to be about 22 mu s by time-resolving the three intrinsic emissions of the ZnWO4 crystallites. This work illustrates that magnetron sputtering is an effective technique to prepare the fluorescing ZnWO4 film.

AB In this study, a new ternary rare earth organic complex Eu(POA)(3)TTA was synthesized and successfully doped into the ethylene-methyl acrylate copolymer (EMA) resins. The transparent doped EMA (Eu-EMA) films with excellent fluorescence performance were obtained by making full use of the excellent compatibility and filling performance of EMA resins. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), elemental analysis, MALDI-TOF MS, scanning electron microscope (SEM), photoluminescence tests, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and static water contact angle measurements were used to characterize the properties of the complexes Eu(POA)(3)TTA and the Eu-EMA films. FT-IR analysis, elemental analysis and MALDI-TOF MS verify the ligands were successfully coordinated with the Eu3+ ions. The Eu(POA)(3)TTA particles are well dispersed in the EMA matrix and only a small fraction of them precipitate out to the surface of the EMA films. The relationship between fluorescence emission intensity of the Eu-EMA films and the doping ratios of Eu(POA)(3)TTA to EMA resins has been studied and discussed. The fluorescence intensity of the Eu-EMA films reaches the maximum when the doping ratio is 1.0 wt%. The Eu-EMA films all have high thermal stability (T-d >= 392 degrees C) and the T-d value enhances as the doping ratio increasing. As a result, the Eu-EMA films possess potential application for luminescent materials even at high temperatures.

AB A Series of Alkaline-Earth Boro Tellurite (AEBT) glasses doped with different concentrations of Dy3+ ions have been prepared by using melt quenching technique and characterized using spectroscopic techniques such as XRD, Raman, optical absorption, excitation, photoluminescence (PL) and PL decay to understand their utility in optoelectronic devices such as lasers and white light emitting diodes (wLEDs). The XRD spectrum revealed non-crystalline nature whereas the Raman spectrum revealed the phonon energy and various functional groups present in the undoped host glass. The intensities of the electronic transitions and the ligand field environment around the Dy3+ ions were studied by applying Judd-Ofelt (J-O) theory to the recorded absorption spectra of the AEBTDy glasses. The J-O parameters were used to measure various radiative parameters for the prominent fluorescent levels of Dy3+ ions in the asprepared glasses. The emission spectra of Dy3+ ions doped AEBT glasses under 387 nm excitation show three emission transitions F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) (blue), F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) (yellow), and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(11/2) (red) of which the yellow transition observed at 575 nm is highly intense. The fluorescence decay curves for the as prepared glasses have been recorded for 757 nm transition under 387 nm excitation wavelength. The experimental lifetimes (tau(exp)) measured from the decay spectral profiles are combined with radiative lifetimes (tau(R)) to measure quantum efficiencies of the asprepared glasses. The yellow to blue intensity ratios and chromaticity color co-ordinates are found to vary with Dy3+ ion concentrations. All the aforementioned results finally revealed that the AEBT glasses doped with Dy3+ ions are aptly suitable for the design and development of optoelectronic devices such as wLEDs and lasers.

AB Chemically stoichiometric chalcogenide glasses of xGeSe(2)-(100-x)As2Se3 (x = 0, 20, 40, 60, 80) have been synthesized by using the melt-quenching method, and their optical and thermal stability for femtosecond laser writing have been investigated. It was found that, glass transition temperature increases while thermal expansion coefficient decreases with increasing Ge contents. The laser-induced damage threshold under 800 nm and 4.0 mu m fs laser irradiation was also investigated. They are 183.8 and 323.97 mJ/cm(2) at 800 nm and 4.0 mu m for 80GeSe(2)-20As(2)Se(3), being 1.61 and 2.02 times higher than the sizes of As2Se3 glasses, respectively. The introduction of Ge can significantly improve the optical and thermal stability of Ge-As-Se glasses that are promising in the application of high-stability photonic device prepared by femtosecond laser writing.

AB Cerium yttrium alwninunt garnet (Ce:YAG, CexY3-xAl5O12) nanoparticles doped with different cerium amount were obtained by calcining the precursors synthesized via co-precipitation in w/o microemulsion for 1 hat 900 degrees C. The structural and morphological properties were investigated by using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) in order to investigate the effect of doping level on formation and microstructure of obtained nanoparticles. It was found that the composition of the final products strongly depends on the concentration of cerium. The formation of single YAG phase was observed only at 0.5% cerium. For other concentrations, a mixture of YAG and yttria phases was obtained indicating an effect of the cerium on stabilization of sesquioxide phase. Optical properties of the single phase powder were also investigated in details.

AB In the paper the new application of nanoceria (CeO2-x nanoparticles) for detection and quantification of hydrogen peroxide (HP) content in water solutions is shown. Sensing of hydrogen peroxide is based on the reversible shift of Ce3+ <--> Ce4+ balance in ceria nanoparticles as a result of nanoceria-oxidant interaction. Intensity of 5 d -> 4f luminescence of Ce(3+ )ions being a measure of Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio in nanoceria depends linearly on the hydrogen peroxide concentration in water solutions and, so, can be used for reliable quantification of HP content. The nanoceria-based sensor is reversible and applicable for long-term monitoring of oxidant level in biological systems.

AB Carbazole based pyridone dyes are investigated for their non-linear optical (NLO) properties. They exhibit positive solvatochromism and charge transfer character with a high fluorescence quantum yield which encouraged us to study their NLO characteristics. Photophysical properties of dyes in different solvents are evaluated and correlated with computational optical absorption and fluorescence emission using global hybrid (B3LYP) and long range separated functional (CAM-B3LYP) with 6-31G(d) basic set. Frontier Molecular Orbital analysis and Generalised Mulliken Hush analysis reveal a strong intramolecular molecular charge transfer character in these dyes. DFT and TD-DFT are performed to understand the electronic and photophysical properties of dyes. The resultant decrease in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap is responsible for bathochromic shift. Large enhancement in the non-linear optical properties are seen for these dyes than urea confirming their use in non-linear optical materials. The MEP analysis reveals the sites for electrophilic and nucleophilic attack in the dye. The experimental data are in good agreement with those obtained by computation (OFT) method. Fundamental limiting values of beta, gamma for dyes are observed within the estimated limits.

AB A simple and direct microwave-assisted method was used to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) in a single step using an ammonia solution of xylan as the precursor at a treatment temperature of 200 degrees C and an input power of 200 W within just 10 min. It was found that the N-CQDs synthesized by such green, economical, and fast routes possess high crystal quality, favorable photoluminescence properties, and high tolerance for salts and metal ions. More interestingly, we found that the as-prepared N-CQDs without any modification exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity towards tetracycline antibiotics owing to an inner-filter effect. At the optimum conditions, a novel sensing platform for sensitive detection of tetracycline in a linear range of 0.05-20 mu M with a detection limit of 6.49 nM was established, suggesting a promising application for the quantification of tetracycline in biomedical analysis.

AB The near-infrared spectral region is being used for various fields of applications. Near infrared emitters based on InGaN-ZnSnN2 material systems have not been proposed yet. In this paper, a novel type-II InGaN-ZnSnN2/GaN quantum well (QW) light emitting diode structure is presented for the near-infrared emission. Computations are based on the self-consistent solutions of Schrodinger and Poison equations. In the proposed structure, the emission wavelength (lambda) and the overlap of electron and hole wave functions (M-eh) are studied with current densities, for different dopings, compositions and well widths of the structure. It is found that the M-eh and the radiative efficiency are more than 30% and 40% respectively. The large overlap of electron and hole wave functions should make QW light emitting diodes in the near infrared range based on these structures feasible.

AB Broad band near infrared (NIR) light sources are currently of great interest in many application areas, especially in near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Due to the declining availability of incandescent and halogen light sources, there is a strong demand for other efficient broad band NIR light sources. NIR phosphor converted (pc) LEDs are presently explored to realize efficient broadband NIR sources. Herein, we report on the luminescence properties of Cr3+ doped Sr8MgLa(PO4)(7) (SMLP) which is a potential luminescent converter for high power broad band NIR pcLEDs. Microcrystalline powders of SMLP doped with different Cr3+ concentration were synthesized by solid state reactions and exhibit efficient near infrared broad band emission upon excitation in the blue/cyan spectral range. The emission extends from 700 to 1000 nm (FWHM = 140 nm) and is assigned to the spin-allowed T-4(2) -> (4)A(2) transition of Cr3+. The optical properties of Cr3+ ions in SMLP were examined in terms of spectroscopic parameters such as crystal field strength, Racah parameters, and phonon coupling parameters. The photoluminescence quenching temperature (T-1/2) is a crucial parameter for blue to NIR radiation converters as the high power (In,Ga)N LEDs (pumping source) reach junction temperatures up to similar to 450 K. The Sr8MgLa (PO4)(7):Cr3+ phosphors reveal rather low quenching temperatures (T-1/2 congruent to 300 K) mainly due to a strong electron-phonon coupling, while the presented results provide insight in factors determining thermal quenching.

By utilizing the bipolar material 2,6-bis(3-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-pyridine (26DCzPPy) and hole type material 4,4',4 ''-Tri(9-carbazoyl)triphenylamine (TcTa) as host and ladder materials, respectively, the optimized single light-emitting layer (EML) orange device obtained the maximum brightness, external quantum efficiency, current efficiency and power efficiency up to 41791 cd/m(2), 13.1%, 42.97 cd/A and 44.98 lm/W, respectively. Except for the 570 nm characteristic emission, interestingly, there is another emission peak at about 475 nm, which increases rapidly with decreasing doping concentration. Therefore, device color shifts gradually from orange to warm white with decreasing doping concentration due to the increasing relative intensity of exciplex emission. Finally, warm white device (Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) Coordinates at (0.337, 0.476)) based on single TADF emitter with the maximum brightness, external quantum efficiency, current efficiency and power efficiency up to 23560 cd/m(2), 10.2%, 32.33 cd/A and 32.75 lm/W, respectively, was also obtained.

AB We use the fluorescence decay of quantum dot bioconjugates and their size distribution as near field probes to investigate lattice-induced plasmonic resonances and their interaction with excitons. The quantum dots are biologically immobilized on gold nanoantenna arrays while their spontaneous emission decay rates are spectrally resolved. Our results show that the periodic arrangement of the nanoantennas can generate or optically activate certain plasmonic resonances, different from their intrinsic plasmon modes. This includes formation of a hybrid photonic-plasmonic dipole mode that can strongly couple with the quantum dots, making their decay rates anisotropic and wavelength dependent. The anisotropic decay is decided by the shapes and sizes of the nanoantennas and by the direction of the quantum dot dipoles. The results suggest lattice-induced plasmonic resonances can be used as engineered states to drive transfer of energy between quantum dots at certain wavelengths.

AB The changes in the structural, electronic, vibrational and optical properties of 5-Bromo-2-nitropyridine organic molecule have been investigated. The semi-emprical realtions have been proposed for the calculation of the refractive index (n). The energy gap (E-g), harmonic frequencies, Mullkien atomic charges, density of states (DOS), radial distribution functions (RDFs) and coordination number of binary interactions were searched. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectral analysis has been carried out using experimental techniques and time dependent (TD) DFT calculations. The stability of the organic compound changes based on solvent environment. Eg decreases depending on increase in the concentration. The compound in chloroform is more stable than that of the other solvents. The theoretical calculations are consistent with the experimental results.

AB Recently, terahertz (THz) emission from ferromagnetic materials has aroused significant scientific interest. Our interest is in the interactions between FeCrAl alloy films and THz emission characteristics. Preference-orientation (110) FeCrAl alloy films with different element percentage of Fe, Cr, Al were fabricated by magnetron sputtering technology. The corresponding magnetization and the THz emission characteristics were studied by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and Fourier Transform Spectrometer. The results showed that for the first time broadband THz spectra in the frequency range of 2 THz to 15 THz from the FeCrAl alloy films excited by a direct current power have been emitted. The THz radiation intensity was determined by the magnetization and the electric current. The broadband THz emission from FeCrAl alloy films, which can be due to the thermal demagnetization and the surface second-order nonlinear optical effects were discussed.

AB In this paper, non-rare-earth boron carbon oxynitride (BCNO) long afterglow phosphors were prepared by a rapid self-propagating combustion method. The precursor was obtained using boric acid, melamine and glycine as raw materials and then the BCNO phosphors with optimum luminescence properties were successfully synthesized after calcination of the precursor at 625 degrees C for 2 h in air atmosphere. The product and its luminescence properties were characterized with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), excitation and emission spectra by fluorescence spectrometer. With the contents of increasing glycine, the luminescence emission peaks of as-prepared BCNO phosphors appear distinctly redshift, which is closely induced by the presence of different types of defects including the paramagnetic centre of nitrogen vacancies (V-N), carbon and oxygen related impurity. In addition, the blue-purple emitting phosphors still remain long-lasting luminescence after stopping irradiation by UV light for 10 min. The developed BCNO phosphors have great practical applications in display, illumination, solar cell and biomedical fields.

AB Europium complex Eu(TTA)(3)phen (TTA = 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) was incorporated into polymer blends made of polystyrene (PS), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) to fabricate Eu(TTA)(3)phen/PVDF-PS, Eu(TTA)(3)phen/PVDF-PMMA and Eu(TTA)(3)phen/ PS-PMMA nanofibers by electrospinning for photoluminescent fabric designing. These nanofibers have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Photoluminescence of Eu(TTA)(3)phen/ polymer blends nanofibers was systematically compared with pure Eu(TTA)(3)phen which showed typical Eu3+ ion red emission, assigned to the transitions between the first excited state D-5(0) and the multiplet (F-7(0-3)). The presence of different polymer blends as matrix for Eu(TTA)(3)phen increases the fluorescent intensity of the D-5(0)-> E-7(2) hypersensitive transition of Eu3+ ions. Eu(TTA)(3)phen/PVDF-PS and Eu(TTA)(3)phen/PVDF-PMMA nanofibers showed better photoluminescence properties compared to that of Eu(TTA)(3)phen/PMMA-PS nanofibers because of influence of polymers on the coordinative environment of europium ions and the dimensional effect of polymer blend fibers. Eu(TTA)(3)phen/PVDF-PS and Eu(TTA)(3)phen/PVDF-PMMA nanofibers are found to be potential materials for photoluminescent material designing.

AB In this study, synthesis of WO3 nanoparticles (NPs), using the physically clean method known as laser ablation of a tungsten target immersed in distilled water is reported. Fundamental wavelength of an acousto-optically Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with 13, 18, 23 J/cm(2) laser fluences was utilized for this purpose. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) associated with Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) show an increase in average particle size as the laser fluence increases from 13 to 23 J/cm(2), also with a precise look into the TEM images, the chains of WO3 NPs are observable although the length of the chains decreases while decreasing the laser fluence. Photocatalytic and antimicrobial activity of the products against E. coli (Escherichia cob) bacteria under UV and visible light illumination were investigated and showed that for photocatalytic and antibacterial processes, active surface area and energy band gap play the main roles while illuminating the nanoparticle samples with UV and visible light, respectively. Moreover, anti-UV properties of the products originated from half harmonic generation process were corroborated by PL (photoluminescence) emission studies.

AB ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ is a well-known deep red (persistent) phosphor with R-lines due to the E-2 ->(4)A(2) spin-forbidden transition of Cr3+ ions between 690 and 750 nm. Recently, this system has attracted a great deal of interest for in-vivo bio-imaging. In this study, we investigated the temperature dependence of photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ and the possibility of using this material for thermometry. At 80 K, the zero-phonon lines and phonon-side bands of the E-2 ->(4)A(2) transition were observed in the PL spectrum. At higher temperatures above 250 K, a broad PL band was observed at around 720 nm in addition to the sharp E-2 ->(4)A(2) luminescence. After determination of the Stokes shift energy between the PL and PL excitation spectra and the increase of broad luminescence band intensity with increasing temperature, we attribute this additional broad luminescence band to the spin-allowed T-4(2)->(4)A(2) transition of Cr3+ ions. The fluorescence intensity ratio of these emission transitions (T-4(2)->(4)A(2))/(E-2 ->(4)A(2)) shows good linearity from 270 K to 700 K in the Arrhenius plot. The activation energy needed for excitation from the E-2 state to the T-4(2) state of Cr3+ was estimated to be 1744 cm(-1). Based on our results, we suggest that the ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ system can work well as a ratiometric thermometer with a high relative sensitivity of 2.8 %K-1 (at 310 K) in a wide temperature range.

AB Recently, downconversion materials have attracted considerable research due to large promotion of the efficiency of silicon-based solar cells through the absorption of solar radiation via quantum cutting. However, due to lack of ideal downconversion material, it is emergent to seek novel downconversion phosphors with large ultraviolet absorption and high quantum efficiency. Herein, we reported the photoluminescence performance and dynamics of a downconversion phosphor La2GeO5: Bi3+, Nd3+. This phosphor presents a strong ultraviolet absorption and emits a series of intense near infrared emissions by quantum cutting. The emission energy from the Nd3+ matches the energy gap of silicon-based solar cells which can improve the solar cell efficiency.
   Energy transfer from Bi3+ to Nd3+ in La2GeO5 occurs, proving that energy transfer mechanism of Bi3+ -> Nd3+ is an electric dipole-dipole (DMSO-d(6)) interaction. The energy transfer efficiency of Bi3+ -> Nd3+ and theoretical quantum efficiency for La2GeO5: Bi3+, Nd3+ are calculated to be as high as 91% and 191%, respectively. La1.92GeO5:0.03Bi(3+), 0.05Nd(3+) phosphor presents a promising thermal behavior with an activation energy of 0.152 eV. Thus, the development of near-infrared downconversion Bi3+, Nd3+ co-doped phosphors might open up a new approach to achieve high efficiency silicon solar cells by means of quantum cutting.

AB The Sm3+/Eu3+/Li+ co-doped cerium oxide phosphor has been synthesized through co-precipitation and hydro thermal method. The structure and phase of these crystals have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, and it turned out to be the cubic fluorite cerium oxide structure. The spectroscopic investigations of the synthesized phosphors reveal that the Sm3+-doped phosphor emits visible radiation in the red regions upon excitation with 365 nm. However, the addition of Eu3+ to the Sm3+-doped phosphor decrease the magnetic-dipole transitions of Sm3+, and then it emit an intense red emission corresponding to the characteristic transitions of Eu3+. It is also found that the presence of Li+ in the Sm3+/Eu3+ co-doped cerium oxide phosphor obviously enhance the emission intensity of Eu3+, whereas the increase of Sm3+ emission intensity is not obvious. A plausible mechanism of Li+ for that luminescence enhancement of Eu3+ is suggested based on experimental studies. There may be a energy transfer from the excited 5d state of Ce3+ to the F-4(7/2) of Sm3+ ions, and the F-4(7/2) of Sm3+ ions further relaxed to the (4)G(S/2) level by nonradiative relaxation. The two times enhancement in the electric-dipole transitions of Eu3+ is found, and thus Sm3+/Eu3+/Li+ co-doped cerium oxide phosphor may be provided with a potential application for the high efficient dye-sensitized solar cell.

AB Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is shaped by persistent framings that arise from historical context. Two established frames are identified as co-existing and dominant in contemporary innovation policy discussions. The first frame is identified as beginning with a Post-World War II institutionalisation of government support for science and R&D with the presumption that this would contribute to growth and address market failure in private provision of new knowledge. The second frame emerged in the 1980s globalising world and its emphasis on competitiveness which is shaped by the national systems of innovation for knowledge creation and commercialisation. STI policy focuses on building links, clusters and networks, and on stimulating learning between elements in the systems, and enabling entrepreneurship. A third frame linked to contemporary social and environmental challenges such as the Sustainable Development Goals and calling for transformative change is identified and distinguished from the two earlier frames. Transformation refers to socio-technical system change as conceptualised in the sustainability transitions literature. The nature of this third framing is examined with the aim of identifying its key features and its potential for provoking a re-examination of the earlier two frames. One key feature is its focus on experimentation, and the argument that the Global South does not need to play catch-up to follow the transformation model of the Global North. It is argued that all three frames are relevant for policymaking, but exploring options for transformative innovation policy should be a priority.

AB The topics addressed in this paper concern the (much-needed) transition to sustainability and what role (innovation) policy can play in speeding up such changes. In their Discussion Paper Schot and Steinmueller (2018) argue that the existing theorizing and knowledge bases within the field of innovation studies are "unfit" for this task and that a totally new approach is required. This paper takes issue with this claim. Policy advice, it is argued, needs to be anchored in the accumulated research on the issue at hand, in this case, innovation. The paper therefore starts by distilling some important insights on innovation from the accumulated research on this topic and, with this in mind, considers various policy approaches that have been suggested for influencing innovation and sustainability transitions. Finally, the lessons for the development and implementation of transformative innovation policy are considered. It is concluded that the existing theorizing and knowledge base in innovation studies may be of great relevance when designing policies for dealing with climate change and sustainability transitions.

ID RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION
AB Despite progress in science and technology and the economic prosperity achieved by numerous countries over the past century, contemporary global capitalism has left us with severe grand challenges for the future including rising inequality, global warming, modern slavery, child labor and several other human rights struggles. How can we fix them? For many years, scholars and policy makers alike have believed that economic growth (fueled by innovation) would fix institutional failures and lift people out of human misery. We now know that this story creaks. I would suggest that the current grand challenges are related in a non-trivial way to companies' wrongful business conduct, especially that of large multinational corporations which have grown to rival governments in size, and have proven to be powerful agents capable of shaping the global governance agenda. I challenge technological determinism and 'transformative change' frameworks by arguing that the regulation of global capitalism needs to put powerful private actors at center stage since neglecting them will give rise to yet another generation of dysfunctional development and innovation policies.

AB We estimate the effectiveness of policy incentives for adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the 50 U.S. states. We employ a rich dataset of semi-annual state-level new EV vehicle registrations by make and model from 2010 to 2015 and state-level policy instruments that could affect new EV model registrations. We construct two measures of policy, one which aggregates policy instruments that can be assigned a value and a second that aggregates those without explicit values. Using a within model difference-in-difference estimator with high-dimensional fixed effects, we find that a $1000 increase in the value of a state's model-specific EV policies increases registrations of that model within the state by 5-11%.

AB Do creativity methods consistently produce a significant net effect on innovation? Are the impacts of creativity methods related to operating context? Based on an ambidexterity perspective, we examine the effectiveness of different creativity methods on overcoming the tensions of the innovation process at individual and team levels. Drawing on European Union Community Innovation Survey (CIS2010) data collected from 23,537 firms, we estimate causal effects of creativity on innovation through a multivalued treatment effect methodology. Our results show that implementing ambidexterity in creativity methods increases the firm's propensity to innovate and to introduce a market novelty. However, the effect on firm turnover is not always clear. Also, we detect that ambidexterity is more effective in firms that are large in size, have high levels of R&D investment and operate in manufacturing sectors. We discuss the implications of these findings for practice and for future research.

AB Policy mixes may play a crucial role in redirecting and accelerating innovation towards low-carbon solutions, thus addressing a key societal challenge. Towards this end, some argue that the characteristics of such policy mixes matter greatly, yet with little empirical evidence backing up such claims. In this paper we explore this link between policy mix characteristics and low-carbon innovation, using the research case of the transition of the German electricity system towards renewable energy. Our empirical insights are based on an innovation survey administered to German manufacturers of renewable power generation technologies which builds on the Community Innovation Survey. For our purposes we adjusted the survey to better capture companies' perceptions of policy mixes. Employing a bivariate Tobit model we find evidence that companies' perceptions regarding the consistency and credibility of the policy mix are positively associated with their innovation expenditures for renewable energies, and this positive link intensifies when considering the mutual interdependence of these policy mix characteristics. In contrast, neither the comprehensiveness of the instrument mix nor the coherence of policy processes were found to be related to innovation expenditures. Overall, these findings suggest that future research on low-carbon and eco-innovation should pay greater attention to the characteristics of policy mixes, rather than focusing on policy instruments only. Finally, our findings indicate a need to consider how policy may be measured in innovation surveys to generate better informed policy advice regarding the greening of innovation.

AB This work contributes to previous research on the relationship between specific features of a regional knowledge space and the technological progress of the region. In particular, the main element of originality of this work is to have singled out the determinants of the technological progress intensity and relevance. We acknowledge the importance of knowledge assets for new knowledge production, and we identify path-dependent processes that allow a region to become increasingly competitive in terms of innovation potential. In particular, adopting an evolutionary view of regional development, we describe the regional knowledge space through four crucial characteristics: 1) technological knowledge base, 2) technological cumulativeness, 3) technological diversification, and 4) technological relatedness. We then measure to what extent each of the knowledge space's characteristics differently affects the technological progress intensity and relevance of the region. A longitudinal study of 269 European regions over the period 1996-2012 was organized using data from REGPAT and Eurostat databases. Results show that technological relatedness affects positively both the intensity and relevance of the technological progress of European regions and that the other components of the knowledge space show a different impact on the two features of the technological progress. Finally, implications for EU policies supporting and stimulating regional technological progress are discussed.

Within this context, we develop four hypotheses regarding specific R&D strategies that affect a firm's ability to develop inventions that diffuse beyond the firm's technological boundaries. Specifically, we examine how a fur's scientific intensity, technological collaborations, technological diversity, and internal focus impact breadth of innovation diffusion. We use two of the main determinants of innovation diffusion, namely, the relative advantage and the observability, as theoretical mechanisms to build our arguments. We empirically test our hypotheses on longitudinal data from the industries of pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and chemicals. Our findings show that the extent to which the knowledge embedded in a firm's inventions diffuses in distant technological areas is positively related to the firm's scientific intensity and to its extent of collaboration, but it is negatively related to its technological diversity.

AB Legal surprises are unexpected suits or actions in which plaintiffs rely on claims or precedents that may be obscure, unfamiliar, or unknown to the defendants. Our study explores false patent marking suits, a unique type of patent-related legal surprise involving allegations of defendants marking products with ineligible patent numbers to deceive customers and/or deter competitors. An abrupt shift in U.S. Federal Courts' interpretation of intellectual property rights (IPRs) policy amplified plaintiff incentives for filing these suits while escalating defendant penalties for proven violations. Handling costly legal surprises such as false patent marking suits requires focused attention from managers. Our core premise is that temporal and evidential cues in the timelines and storylines of plaintiffs' legal narratives in surprise suits attract defendants' organizational attention. We hypo thesize about temporal focus (past, present, and future) and evidentiary reasoning (relevance, credibility, and inferential power) as attention cues and possible predictors of the mode (litigation or negotiation) and timing of case resolution. We apply automated content analysis to official court records for 992 false patent marking cases (2009-2011) and quantify competing risks using hazard models. We find that differences in temporal focus and evidentiary reasoning in the legal narratives of surprise suits are significant predictors of case resolution mode and timing. We also find that defendants countersuing to redirect plaintiffs' attention is an effective negotiating tactic. We discuss the economic significance and strategic implications of our empirical findings on legal surprises, attention, case resolution mode and timing, and the unintended consequences of IPR policy changes.

The main outcome from the proposed GMM-SYS estimations is the labor-friendly nature of innovation, which we measure in terms of forward-citation weighted patents. However, this positive impact of innovation is statistically significant only for firms in the high-tech manufacturing sectors, while not significant in low-tech manufacturing and services.

AB Leveraging a new measure of patent citation trees (Corredoira and Banerjee, 2015), we demonstrate that research funded by the federal government is associated with more active and diverse technological trajectories. Our findings tie government funding to breakthrough inventions. The differences are especially evident at the upper percentiles of the distribution of long term patent influence and stem primarily from research conducted outside the federal government and sponsored by the DOD, HHS and NSF. Government funded patents are inputs into a broader range of technologies. Additional analyses indicate that federal programs invest in some technological areas that private corporations eschew, and federally funded university patents are in different technological classes than non-federally funded university patents. In this sense, the government may play an irreplaceable role in the rate and direction of inventive activity.
   "Generally speaking, the scientific agencies of Government are not so concerned with immediate practical objectives as are the laboratories of industry nor, on the other hand, are they as free to explore any natural phenomena without regard to possible economic applications as are the educational and private research institutions." - Vannevar Bush, Science the Endless Frontier", 1945.

AB The transition from an industrial economy to an innovation economy poses two critical questions for the manufacturing sector in advanced countries. First, given the diffusion of modem manufacturing practices around the world, what level of innovation (incremental, more far-ranging, or radical) is most likely to support a resilient domestic manufacturing sector? Second, are assumed differences in the innovative capacity across space likely to hasten the decline of rural manufacturing? To answer these questions this research combines comprehensive measures of self-reported innovation able to reliably differentiate incremental and more far-ranging innovation with establishment-level data able to examine the geographical distribution of these different innovation strategies. The data used for the analysis includes a two-period panel of manufacturing establishments surveyed in 1996 and 2013 with annual employment data indicating survival in the intervening years. Our findings suggest that long-surviving manufacturing plants overwhelmingly gravitate away from non-innovation strategies toward incremental or more far-ranging innovation orientations. A survival advantage of far-ranging innovation over incremental innovation is observed for standalone firms. We do not identify a difference in the innovation orientations of rural and urban manufacturing establishments.

AB This study explores the channels through which technological investments affect productivity performance of industrialized economies. Using a Stochastic Frontier Model (SFM) we estimate the productivity effects of R&D and ICT for a large sample of OECD industries between 1973 and 2007, identifying four channels of transmission: input accumulation, technological change, technical efficiency and spillovers. Our results show that ICT has been particularly effective in reducing production inefficiency and in generating inter-industry spillovers, while R&D has raised the rate of technical change and favoured knowledge spillovers within sectors. We also quantify the contribution of technological investments to output and total factor productivity growth documenting that R&D and ICT accounted for almost 95% of productivity growth in the OECD area.

AB The Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, is the world's highest-energy particle accelerator. Its construction (1995-2008) required frontier technologies and close collaboration between CERN scientists and contracting firms. The literature on "Big Science" projects suggests that this collaboration generated economic spillovers, particularly through technological learning. CERN granted us access to its procurement database, including suppliers of LHC from 35 countries for orders over 10,000 Swiss Francs. We gathered balance-sheet data for more than 350 of these companies from 1991 to 2014, which include the years before and after that of the first order received. The study assesses, in quantitative terms, whether becoming a CERN supplier induced greater R&D effort and innovative capacity, thus enhancing productivity and profitability. The findings - which controlled for firms' observable characteristics, macroeconomic conditions, and unobserved time, country, industry and firm-level fixed effects indicate a statistically significant correlation between procurement events and company R&D, knowledge creation and economic performance. The correlation is chiefly driven by high-tech orders; for companies receiving non-high-tech orders, it is weaker, or even statistically not significant.

AB Introduction: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are characterised by increased symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and sputum production and/or purulence, leading to greater risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Very few studies have measured long term trends in the incidence of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We therefore investigated the incidence of moderate and severe exacerbations in the UK general population.
   Methods: A population based-study including Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) patients >= 40 years of age with a current diagnosis of COPD within the United Kingdom from 2004 to 2013 was conducted. Individuals with a history of asthma were excluded from main analyses. We calculated the incidence rates for any, moderate, and severe exacerbations. Patients contributed time at risk from January 1st up to the date of the first outcome within each year. The incidence rate for any, moderate and severe exacerbations for COPD in each calendar year was calculated as follows: the sum of any or moderate or severe exacerbations for COPD in that year divided by the total duration of follow-up in the same calendar year from 2005 through to 2013. We then analysed these rates by gender and age categories (40-59 years, 60-79 years and >= 80 years).
   Results: Among 213,561 with incident COPD diagnosis, 86,300 patients were included in the study. From 2005 to 2013, the incidence rate of any exacerbations increased from 89 to 98 per 1000 person years (PYs) (p = 0.005). Women had significantly higher incidence rates of any exacerbation for each calendar year when compared to men (p < 0.0001). The incidence rate of any and moderate exacerbations increased with age from 2005 to 2007. For severe exacerbations incidence decreased from 2005 to 2007 before increasing from 2008 until the end of follow-up (43 per 1000 PYs (95% confidence interval, 42-45/1000PYs) in 2013). Incidence rates of severe exacerbations were similar by gender and patients aged 80 + years had a higher incidence rate of severe exacerbation from 2005 to 2008 after which their incident rate dropped in subsequent years.
   Conclusion: This is the first study that reports the long-term changes in the incidence rates of moderate and severe exacerbations within the UK general practice. Women showed a substantially higher risk of any COPD exacerbations, and their risk is increasing. The incidence rates of any exacerbations increased during the study period, while severe exacerbations were variable. Furthermore, incidence rates varied substantially by age group.

   PATTERNS; VENTILATORY FUNCTION; BRITISH ADULTS; FOLLOW-UP
AB Background: Although smoking is the major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) many patients with obstructive lung function suggesting COPD are never-smokers. Therefore, other lifestyle factors have been suggested as risk factors.
   Aims: i) To examine the association between self-reported intake of fruit and vegetables and risk of COPD and ii) to examine whether the association between these traits are due to underlying genetic factors.
   Methods: 12,449 twins, aged 40-80, from the Danish Twin Registry were recruited. The participants completed a questionnaire on medical history and lifestyle factors and participated in clinical examination. COPD was defined according to ATS/ERS recommendations. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate the risk of COPD in individuals with a low intake of fruit and vegetables. Co-twin control analyses were performed to examine whether the association between fruit and vegetables and COPD is explained by genetic factors. Self-reported physician-diagnosed asthmatic individuals were excluded.
   Results: Of the 11,458 individuals were included in the analyses, 48% of the participants were males. Mean age was 58.9 (years) +/- SD 9.6, mean BMI (kg/m(2)) 26.6 +/- SD 4.4. A multivariate logistic regression, including sex, age and BMI showed that both smoking, no and heavy drinking and physical inactivity were independent predictors of COPD. There was a significant frequency-pendent association between intake of fruit and vegetables and increased risk of COPD. Conditional logistic regression analyses showed that the association might be controlled by genetic factors.
   Conclusions: This study shows that low intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with an increased risk of COPD and the association might be under influence of genetic factors.

AB Objective: To describe the clinical and economic burden of severe asthma in France over 12 months.
   Methods: Data were retrieved from the observational, prospective "Cohorte Obstruction Bronchique et Asthme" (COBRA) cohort, which has enrolled nearly 1000 asthma patients since 2007 from throughout France. Patients undergoing treatment with GINA step-4 or 5 medications uninterruptedly for 12 months (thus defining "severe asthma") were identified and their clinical data used to describe the clinical burden of asthma (exacerbations, symptoms outside exacerbations, and level of asthma control). Patients' utilization of healthcare resources was described and used to estimate the direct medical costs incurred to treat severe asthma.
   Results: 155 patients were included in the present study. Over the 12-month period of interest, 128 (83%) patients experienced at least one asthma exacerbation, 22 (14%) patients were hospitalized for asthma, 133 (86%) patients experienced continuous symptoms outside exacerbations, and 77 (50%) patients experienced important limitations in daily life activities. The median number of asthma-related drugs used was 4. The mean estimated annual asthma-related cost was 8,222 euros (standard deviation, SD=11,886), including 7,229 euros (SD=11,703) for controller medications.
   Conclusion: Symptoms outside exacerbation periods are highly prevalent in severe asthma patients, for whom the main driver of medical costs is controller medication.

ID OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; EXACERBATIONS; OUTCOMES
AB Background: Evidence is needed to determine the role of telehealth (TH) in COPD management.
   Methods: PROMETE II was a multicentre, randomized, 12-month trial. Severe COPD patients in stable condition were randomized to a specific monitoring protocol with TH or routine clinical practice (RCP). The primary objective was to reduce the number of COPD exacerbations leading to ER visits/hospital admissions between groups.
   Results: Overall, 237 COPD patients were screened, and 229 (96.6%) were randomized to TH (n=115) or RCP (n = 114), with age of 71 +/- 8 years and 80% were men. Overall, 169 completed the full follow-up period. There were no statistical differences at one year between groups in the proportion of participants who had a COPD exacerbation (60% in TH vs. 53.5% in RCP; p=0.321). There was, however, a marked but non-significant trend towards a shorter duration of hospitalization and days in ICU in the TH group (18.9 +/- 16.0 and 6.0 +/- 4.6 days) compared to the RCP group (22.4 +/- 19.5 and 13.3 +/- 11.1 days). The number of all-cause deaths was comparable between groups (12 in TH vs. 13 in RCP) as was total resource utilization cost (7912_ in TH vs. 8918(sic) in RCP). Telehealth was evaluated highly positively by patients and doctors.
   Conclusions: Remote patient management did not reduce COPD-related ER visits or hospital admissions compared to RCP within 12 months.

AB Objective and background: Impaired cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia during wakefulness at rest as well as reduced exercise tolerance have been reported in severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Impaired cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics can contribute to reduced exercise performance. We hypothesized that (i) OSA patients show impaired cerebrovascular response both during exercise and in response to hypercapnia together with reduced exercise tolerance and (ii) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment improves these alterations in cerebral oxygenation.
   Methods: Fifteen OSA patients and 12 healthy matched controls performed a hypercapnic response test and a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after eight weeks of CPAP treatment or control period. Prefrontal cortex and muscle oxygenation were assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during both tests.
   Results: Cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia was impaired in OSA patients (lower increase in oxyhemoglobin [0.29 +/- 0.19 vs 0.44 +/- 0.14 mu mol mmHg(-1)] and total hemoglobin [0.14 +/- 0.15 vs 0.26 +/- 0.09 mu mol mmHg]) compared to controls. Reduced prefrontal cortex oxygen extraction and total blood volume (ie, lower increase in deoxyhemoglobin [1.76 +/- 1.57 vs 3.43 +/- 2.08 mu mol] and total hemoglobin [5.36 +/- 7.08 vs 8.55 +/- 5.13 mu mol] at exhaustion], respectively) during exercise together with a reduced exercise tolerance (ie, lower peak oxygen consumption) were observed in OSA patients compared to controls. CPAP treatment did not induce any improvement in cerebrovascular response during hypercapnic response test and exercise.
   Conlusions: This study demonstrates that cerebrovascular response to exercise is altered in OSA and may contribute to exercise intolerance in these patients. Prefrontal cortex oxygenation and exercise tolerance are not significantly improved following eight weeks of CPAP treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Periodic limb movements (PLMs) can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Small vessel disease (SVD) has been considered a precursor to symptomatic stroke. We aimed to investigate the association between PLMs and cerebral SVD.
   Methods: We enrolled participants who visited our clinic for the evaluation of sleep disturbance and underwent overnight polysomnography and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The processing steps included rating and analyzing white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), cerebral microbleeds (CMGs), asymptomatic lacunar infarctions (ALIs), perivascular spaces (PVSs), and calculating the total SVD score. Logistic regression and correlation analyses were used to examine the association between PLMs during sleep (PLMS) and SVD.
   Results: A total of 31 (19 men and 12 women) patients with PLMS index >= 15/h were enrolled. The mean age was 61.7 years and the median PLMS index was 46.5/h. A total of 29 controls (16 men and 13 women) with PLMS index < 5/h were also included. PLMS index was positively associated with an increase in WMHs, ALIs, and PVSs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.022, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.003-1.040, p = 0.008; OR = 1.024, 95% CI = 1.006-1.043, p = 0.010; OR = 1.029, 95% CI = 1.010-1.049, p = 0.003, respectively). Correlation analyses revealed that total SVD score was significantly correlated with PLMS index (r = 0.504, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: An elevated PLMS index was associated with an increase in WMHs, ALIs, PVSs, and total SVD burden. Our study suggests that PLMS is a marker for SVD, which carries a potential risk for progression to overt stroke or cognitive impairment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is crucial. Our aim was to identify protective and risk factors against the discontinuation of CPAP treatment in patients with OSA and to estimate the mortality risk in those who were non-adherent to CPAP therapy.
   Methods: This was a registry-based cohort study from 37 centers across Sweden with OSA patients on CPAP in the Swedevox Swedish national registry between July 2010 and March 2017.
   Results: In 16,425 patients (70.8% men) with complete follow-up data after 1.2 +/- 0.8 years the adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR) for the discontinuation of CPAP was 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.65) for use of humidifier, 0.87 (95% CI 0.82-0.92) for increasing age per 10 years, 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83) for increasing apnea hypopnea index (AHI) per 5 units/hour, and 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97) per increased unit on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Increasing BMI was associated with increased adherence up to BMI 35. Women and patients with hypertension ran an increased risk of discontinuing CPAP treatment, aRRR 1.28 (95% CI 1.12-1.46) and 1.24 (95% CI 1.12-1.42) respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 1.74 (95% CI 1.32-2.28) among those who did not adhere to CPAP (median follow-up period 2.4 years after the one year adherence evaluation).
   Conclusion: Use of humidifier is associated with greater adherence to CPAP treatment. Other factors predicting adherence are increasing age, more severe OSA and overweight up to BMI 35, whereas female gender and coexisting hypertension are risk factors for discontinuation of CPAP. Failure to adhere to CPAP is associated with increased mortality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Gravitational forces, negative pressure and facial structure in the
   genesis of airway dysfunction during sleep: a review of the paradigm

   MORPHOLOGY; CHILDREN; GROWTH; CEPHALOMETRY; ASSOCIATION; POSITION
AB The recent and distant literature has extensive discussion of how sleep apnea, adeno-tonsillar growth, and facial structural deformity are related. Conventionally, the order of cause and effect is as follows: (1) Inflammatory/infectious process -> tonsillar/adenoid tissue growth ->(2) airway obstruction and mouth breathing/Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)->(3) altered facial structure (adenoid facies). Using this same reasoning, adenotonsillectomy is the first line of treatment in the prevention of structural abnormalities.
   However, through a lifetime of clinical research Christian Guilleminault and his colleagues have challenged this paradigm. Through multiple articles and studies, Guilleminault et al., teach that even slight (subclinical) facial structure/muscle tone variations may be the inciting event triggering mouth-breathing and the eventual adenotonsillar growth in most patients. Essentially, this is the reverse of the conventional paradigms. Initial treatments therefore shift from simplified removal of inflammatory tissue to limiting mouth-breathing via musculo-skeletal modification. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize and analyze the recent (and distant) relevant literature to provide support for, and provide a potential anatomic mechanism for Guilleminault et al.'s paradigm-questioning clinical observations.

AB Social jetlag is a term used to describe misalignment between biological and social time. Measured as the difference in sleep midpoints between work and free days, social jetlag has been associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and adverse health outcomes. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of social jetlag, and its sociodemographic and behavioural correlates in 837 respondents who completed the Sleep Health Foundation Australia 2016 online survey. Binomial logistic regression models determined associations between social jetlag and self-reported lifestyle and work outcomes, excluding night, evening or rotating shift workers. One third (31.1%) of respondents experienced >1 h of social jetlag. In analyses adjusted for sociodemographic variables associated with social jetlag (age, marital status, work status and metropolitan living plus the significant interaction term for age by metro living), social jetlag was associated with longer sleep duration on free days (OR = 2.8, CI = 1.9-4.1), evening preference (OR = 2.0, CI = 1.4-2.4), often staying up later than planned on work days (OR 1.9, CI = 1.3-2.9), and having a computer (OR = 1.7, CI = 1.2-2.4 ) or phone (OR = 1.6, CI = 1.1-2.4) in the bedroom and internet use in the hour before bed (OR = 1.7, CI 1.2-2.5). Almost twice as many working respondents with social jetlag reported going to work when they should have taken sick leave due to their state of health (OR = 1.9, CI = 1.3-3.0). In conclusion, social jetlag is prevalent in the Australian community and associated with bedtime technology use. Work attendance when in poor health is cause for concern in Australian day workers and requires further investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of a brief behavioral intervention for insomnia (BBTi) on sleep parameters, mood, and cognitive functioning in older adults.
   Methods: Older adults (aged 65 years or more) underwent four weekly sessions of BBTi or self-monitoring control (SMC). Participants completed 14 days of sleep diaries and actigraphy measuring sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and sleep quality ratings at baseline, post-treatment, and three month follow-up. Participants also completed mood scales (Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS]; Beck Depression Inventory-II; and State Trait Anxiety Inventory) and neuropsychological testing (measuring global cognition, language, memory, attention and processing speed, and executive function) at the three timepoints.
   Results: Significant condition (BBTi vs. SMC) x time (baseline vs. post-treatment vs. follow-up) interactions revealed that BBTi improved relative to baseline in sleep diary-reported SOL, WASO, SE, and sleep quality, and these improvements were maintained at follow-up. SMC showed no change in these measures. A main effect of time showed that actigraphy-measured WASO improved from baseline for both BBTi and SMC at post-treatment. A main effect of time revealed that both BBTi and SMC patients endorsed fewer GDS symptoms relative to baseline at post-treatment and follow-up. We observed no change in performance on neuropsychological measures.
   Conclusions: A four-week BBTi is an efficacious intervention for reducing insomnia symptoms in older adults. BBTi does not selectively improve mood or cognitive functioning. Future work should examine effects of BBTi on physiological measures of sleep architecture and day-to-day cognition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study examined nighttime media use in relation to sleep problems and anxiety/depression symptoms in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Methods: Participants were 81 adolescents (69% male) ages 13-17 with ADHD. Adolescents completed measures assessing pubertal development, nighttime media use, circadian preference, and daytime sleepiness. Both adolescents and parents completed measures of sleep duration, sleep problems, and internalizing symptoms.
   Results: When summing across media uses (eg, social networking, playing video games, watching television), the average nighttime media use (after 9:00PM) was 5.31 h. Overall, 63% of adolescents reported obtaining less than 8 h of sleep on school nights, and this percentage rose to 77% for parent-reported sleep duration. Moreover, adolescents obtaining less sleep than recommended had more nighttime media use than those obtaining >= 8 h of nightly sleep. Controlling for age, sex, pubertal development, stimulant medication use, and ADHD symptom severity; nighttime media use was associated with shorter sleep duration and increased sleep problems across both adolescent and parent report. Media use was also associated with greater adolescent-reported anxiety and depression, and marginally associated with eveningness circadian preference and greater daytime sleepiness. In considering specific anxiety dimensions, media use was associated with greater adolescent-reported panic symptoms and parent-reported generalized anxiety disorder symptoms.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that nighttime media use may contribute to sleep problems and co-morbid internalizing symptoms in adolescents with ADHD, although additional studies are needed to determine causality, potential bidirectional associations, and underlying mechanisms such as using media to (mis)manage negative emotions. Media use is important to assess and monitor and may be a significant intervention target when addressing sleep and internalizing problems, and possible underlying cognitive-emotional processes in adolescents with ADHD.

AB Eighty cultures from the Novi Sad Cyanobacterial Culture Collection (NSCCC) were screened for toxicity with Artemia salina bioassay and for common cyanobacterial toxins, microcystins/nodularin (MCs/NOD) and saxitoxin (STX), with ELISA assays. The results show that 22.5% (11) of the investigated cyanobacterial cultures in exponential phase exhibited toxicity in the A. sauna bioassay and 38.7% (31) produced MCs/NOD and/or STX. However, the findings in the two methods applied were contradictory. Therefore, A. sauna bioassay was repeated on 28 cultures in stationary growth phase, which were positive in ELISA assays but not in the initial A. sauna bioassay. Seven more cultures exhibited cell-bound toxicity, and only one extracellular toxicity. The observed difference in the toxicity indicates that cyanobacterial growth phase could affect the screening results.
   The findings also varied depending on the environment from which the cultures originated. In the initial screening via bioassay, 11.8% (6 cultures out of 51) from terrestrial and 17.2% (5 out of 29) from aquatic environment showed cell-bound toxicity. Furthermore, based on the ELISA assay, 31.4% (16) of the cultures from terrestrial ecosystems were positive for the presence of the investigated cyanotoxins, and 51.7% (15) from aquatic ecosystems. Based on all results, more frequent toxin production was observed in cultures originating from aquatic environments. Furthermore, the group of terrestrial cultures that originated from biological loess crusts were basically non-toxic.
   The discrepancies in the results by two different methods indicates that the use of several complementary methods would help to improve the assessment of cyanobacterial toxicity and cyanotoxin analyses.

AB Globally, food and animal feed contamination with mycotoxins is one of the most important challenges affecting human health. Zearalenone is a non-steroidal mycotoxin with estrogen-like activity that has been reported to induce reproductive dysfunctions including polycystic ovary in women. The aim of this study was to assess the possible impact of prolonged low dose zearalenone (0.1 mg/kg b.w.) exposure to increase the risk of developing polycystic ovary in rats. We found that zearalenone increases the plasma insulin, glucose, testosterone, progesterone and luteinizing hormone levels, while the plasma estradiol level was reduced. Zearalenone also incited tumor necrosis factor-alpha and the secreted frizzled-related protein-4 expressions. Histological examination showed atresia of follicles in the treated group. It is concluded that zearalenone intoxication intensely manipulates the plasma hormonal factors and the level of gene expressions related to the polycystic ovary in rats, thus increases the risk of its progression.

AB The insects are a hyperdiverse class containing more species than all other animal groups combined and many employ venom to capture prey, deter predators and micro-organisms, or facilitate parasitism or extra-oral digestion. However, with the exception of those made by Hymenoptera (wasps, ants and bees), little is known about insect venoms. Here, we review the current literature on insects that use venom for prey capture and predator deterrence, finding evidence for fourteen independent origins of venom usage among insects, mostly among the hyperdiverse holometabolan orders. Many lineages, including the True Bugs (Heteroptera), robber flies (Asilidae), and larvae of many Neuroptera, Coleoptera and Diptera, use mouthpart-associated venoms to paralyse and pre-digest prey during hunting. In contrast, some Hymenoptera and larval Lepidoptera, and one species of beetle, use non-mouthpart structures to inject venom in order to cause pain to deter potential predators. Several recently published insect venom proteomes indicate molecular convergence between insects and other venomous animal groups, with all insect venoms studied so far being potently bioactive cocktails containing both peptides and larger proteins, including novel peptide and protein families. This review summarises the current state of the field of entomo-venomics.

AB Members of Mas related G-protein coupled receptors (Mrgpr) are known to mediate itch. To date, several compounds have been shown to activate these receptors, including chloroquine, a common antimalarial drug, and peptides of the RF-amide family. However, specific ligands for these receptors are still lacking and there is a need for novel compounds that can be used to modulate the receptors in order to understand the cellular and molecular mechanism in which they mediate itch. Some cone snail venoms were previously shown to induce itch in mice. Here, we show that the venom of Conus textile induces itch through activation of itch-sensing sensory neurons, marked by their sensitivity to chloroquine. Two RF-amide peptides, CNF-Tx1 and CNF-Tx2, were identified in a C. textile venom gland transcriptome. These belong to the conorfamide family of peptides which includes previously described peptides from the venoms of Conus victoriae (CNF-Vc1) and Conus spurius (CNF-Sr1 and CNF-Sr2). We show that CNF-Vc1 and CNF-Sr1 activate MrgprC11 whereas CNF-Vc1 and CNF-Tx2 activate the human MrgprX1 (hMrgprX1). The peptides CNF-Tx1 and CNF-Sr2 do not activate MrgprC11 or hMrgprX1. intradermal injection of CNF-Vc1 and CNF-Tx2 into the cheek of a transgenic mouse expressing hMrgprX1 instead of endogenous mouse Mrgprs resulted in itch-related scratching thus demonstrating the in vivo activity of these peptides. Using truncated analogues of CNF-Vc1, we identified amino acids at positions 7-14 as important for activity against hMrgprX1. The conopeptides reported here are tools that can be used to advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanism of itch mediated by Mrgprs.

AB Routine laboratory animal tests necessary to assess the toxicity of snake venoms and the preclinical neutralizing ability of antivenoms and other inhibitory substances induce significant pain and distress. This has prompted initiatives to introduce the routine use of analgesia. In this study, the analgesic effect of morphine and tramadol was assessed in tests assessing the lethal, hemorrhagic, myotoxic and edema-forming activities of the venom of the viperid snake Bothrops asper. The Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) and mouse-exploration activity were used to assess pain and its inhibition by the analgesics. Results demonstrate that tests assessing lethality and myotoxicity induce higher levels of pain than assays quantifying hemorrhagic and edema-forming activities. Our observations also indicate that pretreatment of mice with both analgesics, at the doses used, were similarly effective in reducing the MGS magnitude and increase mouse-exploration activity after the administration of B. asper venom. Moreover, the analgesic effect of both drugs was more evident in the myotoxic and lethality assays. Combined with previous observations showing that these analgesics do not alter the extent of toxic effects induced by B. asper venom, our results strongly indicate that the use of analgesia (using either morphine or tramadol) should be considered in the routine assessment of venom toxicity and antivenom efficacy.

AB Introduction: Gelsemium poisoning is caused by consumption of the deadly Gelsemium species such as Gelsemium elegans, leading to significant gastrointestinal, neurological and cardio-respiratory toxicities. In 2011 (Cluster 1) and 2012 (Cluster 2), the authors encountered two clusters of gelsemium poisoning after consumption of the non-toxic parasitic plant Cassytha filiformis. The current study aims to examine the mechanism of gelsemium poisoning mediated by a benign parasitic plant.
   Methods: Qualitative analysis of toxic gelsemium alkaloids using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on the herbal and urine samples from both clusters to confirm exposure. Morphological examination, qualitative analysis of aporphine alkaloids using liquid chromatography ion trap time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-IT-TOF/MS) and Sanger sequencing were performed on the plant sample from Cluster 2 to confirm its identity. A field study was conducted in local countryside and C. filiformis was collected for histological, LC-MS/MS and LC-IT-TOF/MS analyses to study its interaction with G. elegans.
   Results: Gelsemium alkaloids that are not naturally present in C. filiformis were detected in the patients' herbal and urine samples. Misidentification and contamination with G. elegans during the preparation process were excluded by morphological examination of the plant sample from Cluster 2. Its identity as C. filiformis was verified with LC-IT-TOF/MS and molecular analyses. Histological, LC-MS/MS and LC-IT-TOF/MS analyses of C. filiformis collected during the field study confirmed that its haustoria penetrated the vascular bundles of G. elegans and absorbed its gelsemium toxins.
   Conclusions: The non-toxic plant C. filiformis absorbed toxic gelsemium alkaloids from its host, G. elegans, and led to gelsemium poisoning in our patients. Our study provides new insights into the toxicology of such plants. Benign parasitic plants may lead to potentially life-threatening poisoning if it parasitizes toxic hosts and absorbs their phytotoxins. The public awareness of risks associated with the use of these medicinal parasitic plants should be raised.

AB The presence of cyanobacterial blooms and cyanotoxins in water presents a global problem due to the deterioration of ecosystems and the possibility of poisoning in human and animals. Microcystin LR is the most widely distributed cyanotoxin and liver cells are its main target. In the present study, HepG2 cells were used to determine DNA damage of three crude extracts of cyanobacterial blooms containing MC-LR, through comet assay. The results show that all extracts at a concentration of 500 mu g mL(-1) caused low damage in hepatocytes exposed for 24 h, but produced total mortality even at low concentrations at 48 h. Moreover, balloons corresponding to cell apoptosis were found.
   Through HPLC/MS, MC-LR was detected in all samples of cyanobacterial blooms at concentrations of (5,65 mu g ml(-1)) in sample 1, (1,24 mu g ml(-1)) in sample 2 and (57,29 mu g ml(-1)) in sample 3. In addition, in all samples high molecular weights peaks were detected, that may correspond to other microcystins.
   Besides, the cytotoxic effect of a cyanobacterial bloom and some of its chromatographic fractions from the crude extracts were evaluated in U-937, J774, Hela and Vero cell lines, using the enzymatic micromethod (MTT). The highest toxicity was detected in U-937 cells (LC50 = 29.7 mu g mL(-1)) and Vero cells (LC50 = 39.7 mu g mL(-1)).
   Based on these results, it is important to remark that genotoxic and cytotoxicity assays are valuable methods to predict potential biological risks in waters contaminated with blooms of cyanobacteria, since chemical analysis can only describe the presence of cyanotoxins, but not their biological effects.

AB Centipede bites are usually characterized by mildly to moderately painful encounters with humans, however, they are relatively infrequent. The vast majority of centipede envenomations do not cause severe symptoms and only in very rare cases more serious symptoms such as myocardial ischemia and infarction, hematuria, hemoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhage, pruritus, eosinophilic cellulitis, as well as anaphylaxis are observed. More prevalent are symptoms including pain, paresthesia, lethargy, localized necrosis, headache, dizziness and nausea. The numerous symptoms and complications elicited by these envenomations indicate that centipede venom possesses an arsenal of chemical components with functional diversity. Centipede venom is a rich and complex natural source of bioactive proteins, peptides and other small molecules that aid in predation or defense. The venom can induce myotoxic, cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and other toxic effects. The constituents target different cellular processes and pathways which in turn trigger a cascade of physiological reactions in the victim. The venom components are potent and selective on peripheral targets; thus, they are valuable in studying the molecular basis of these envenomation symptoms and complications. This review highlights the clinical importance of centipede envenomation and the recent discoveries on the underlying molecular mechanisms of the resulting symptoms which is crucial in therapy.

AB Photorhabdus luminescens is a gram-negative bacterium that symbiotically associates with insect-parasitic nematode, Heterorhabditis indica. Herein, we have characterized an insecticidal gene, Txp40 (1008 bp) from the indigenous isolates of P. luminescens, and tested its bioefficacy against Galleria mellonella via injectable and oral bioassay. The recombinant protein characterized from P. luminescens strain H3 exhibited comparatively greater insect toxicity than strain H1 in terms of LD50 and LT50 values. Txp40 holds great potential to replace Bt toxins in global agriculture.

AB Bee venom acupuncture is a form of acupuncture in which bee venom is applied to the tips of acupuncture needles, stingers are extracted from bees, or bees are held with an instrument exposing the stinger, and applied to acupoints on the skin. Bee venom is a complex substance consisting of multiple anti-inflammatory compounds such as melittin, adolapin, apamin. Other substances such as phospholipase A2 can be anti-inflammatory in low concentrations and pro-inflammatory in others. However, bee venom also contains proinflammatory substances, melittin, mast cell degranulation peptide 401, and histamine.
   Nevertheless, in small studies, bee venom acupuncture has been used in man to successfully treat a number of musculoskeletal diseases such as lumbar disc disease, osteoarthritis of the knee, rheumatoid arthritis, adhesive capsulitis, and lateral epicondylitis. Bee venom acupuncture can also alleviate neurological conditions, including peripheral neuropathies, stroke and Parkinson's Disease. The treatment has even been piloted in one series to alleviate depression.
   An important concern is the safety of bee venom. Bee venom can cause anaphylaxis, and several deaths have been reported in patients who successfully received the therapy prior to the adverse event. While the incidence of adverse events is unknown, the number of published reports of toxicity is small. Refining bee venom to remove harmful substances may potentially limit its toxicity.
   New uses for bee venom acupuncture may also be considered.

AB Karwinskia parvifolia possesses the highest concentration levels of the anthracenone T-514 (PA1). Studies have demonstrated the induction of apoptosis by PA1 in cancer cell lines. The aim was to investigate the effects of PA1 on the apoptosis of the mouse liver in vivo and its underlying pathway. Sixty CD-1 mice were divided into three groups: untreated, vehicle, and treated with PA1. The animals were euthanized at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h post-treatment. To confirm the toxic effect of PA1 we determined the activity of catalase. Liver sections were prepared for morphological examination and for immunohistochemical evaluation of anti and pro-apoptotic markers. DNA fragmentation was detected by TUNEL assay and electrophoresis. Pre-apoptotic mitochondrial alterations and cytochrome c oxidase activity were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. PA1 induced pre-apoptotic mitochondrial alterations, a high activity of the cytochrome oxidase, and apoptosis in hepatocytes. PA1 caused p53 over-expression and down regulation of PCNA. PA1 also increased the expression levels of the pro-apoptotic markers Bax and Bak, whereas the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 was decreased. PA1 induces apoptosis by activating the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. These results will be useful for studies regarding the use of PA1 as an antineoplastic agent.

AB In the North Eastern region of Morocco, many people are interested in medicinal plants and their uses. However, the rationale for the utilization of medicinal plants has remained largely underestimated with little or no scientific data on plant safety. In this paper we attempt to describe and establish a detailed list of current knowledge in relation to the toxicity of these plants and to evaluate the scientific data concerning the harmful effects of the selected natural products. Our approach consists of collecting published data from literature in specialized journals, books and website related to the toxic plants. This research revealed that 89 plant species, retrieved from 287 plants used as medicine in the North-Eastern region of Morocco, are considered toxic or present some kind of toxicity. Our data determines 55 compounds isolated from the plants which are dominated by five groups of toxic compounds: alkaloids followed by glucosides, terpenoids, protides and phenolics. The present work discusses toxicity-related issues arising from the use of medicinal plants by local people. We conclude that the database considered in this study could serve as an important source of information on the toxicity of medicinal plants used by this society.

AB An enteric virus surrogate and reliable domestic wastewater tracer is needed to manage microbial quality of food and water as (waste)water reuse becomes more prevalent in response to population growth, urbanization, and climate change. Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), a plant pathogen found at high concentrations in domestic wastewater, is a promising surrogate for enteric viruses that has been incorporated into over 29 water- and food-related microbial quality and technology investigations around the world. This review consolidates the available literature from across disciplines to provide guidance on the utility of PMMoV as either an enteric virus surrogate and/or domestic wastewater marker in various situations. Synthesis of the available research supports PMMoV as a useful enteric virus process indicator since its high concentrations in source water allow for identifying the extent of virus log-reductions in field, pilot, and full-scale (waste)water treatment systems. PMMoV reduction levels during many forms of wastewater treatment were less than or equal to the reduction of other viruses, suggesting this virus can serve as an enteric virus surrogate when evaluating new treatment technologies. PMMoV excels as an index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to untreated domestic wastewater because it was detected more frequently and in higher concentrations than other human viruses in groundwater (72.2%) and surface waters (freshwater, 94.5% and coastal, 72.2%), with pathogen co-detection rates as high as 723%. Additionally, PMMoV is an important microbial source tracking marker, most appropriately associated with untreated domestic wastewater, where its pooled specificity is 90% and pooled-sensitivity is 100%, as opposed to human feces where its pooled-sensitivity is only 11.3%. A limited number of studies have also suggested that PMMoV may be a useful index virus for enteric viruses in monitoring the microbial quality of fresh produce and shellfish, but further research is needed on these topics. Finally, future work is needed to fill in knowledge gaps regarding PMMoV's global specificity and sensitivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biofilm formation on membrane surfaces causes many operational problems such as a decrease in permeate flux and an increase in hydraulic resistance. In this study, the ability of bacteria to pass through microfiltration (MF) membranes and the growth potential of microfilterable bacteria were investigated in order to understand biofouling in MF-reverse osmosis (RO) integrated membrane systems. Growth of microfilterable bacteria in MF permeate was observed, indicating that not all MF membranes can guarantee the total rejection of bacteria. Changes in natural organic matter (NOM) characteristics and growth potential of bacteria during the treatment process are important factors in the occurrence of biofilm development in water treatment systems. Analysis of protein-like and humic-like substances in NOM of two successive RO stages revealed an increase in the concentrations of both biopolymers and humic substances of RO concentrates. Unexpectedly, the use of antiscalants was seen to enhance the growth of bacteria in the RO feed water in this study. Bacterial 16s rRNA pyrosequencing revealed that passing source water through the MF membranes dramatically changed bacterial community structure. The bacterial communities that passed through the MF steps primarily belonged to the family Comamonadaceae. However, several bacteria groups including Flavobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae and Sphingomonadaceae selectively composed the biofilm community formed on the RO membranes. Thus, understanding the selectivity and filterability of MF towards microorganisms involved in biofouling on RO membrane surfaces is crucial for the improvement of membrane-related operational processes.

AB Whilst the fouling of MBR membrane surfaces has been very extensively explored by the academic community, there is an increasingly widespread recognition by practitioners of the issue of clogging of membrane channels with sludge solids, sometimes termed "sludging". The study undertaken has quantified this phenomenon using a bespoke test cell allowing a flat sheet membrane channel to be viewed directly during operation and the accumulated solids determined by digital image processing. Sludging behaviour has then been correlated both with the sludge properties, from sludge samples taken from both an industrial and municipal MBR, and the permeability decline rate data.
   The work has revealed the expected trends in fouling propensity, as quantified by the exponent n of the Delta p/Delta t = m.exp(nJ) correlation from classical flux-step tests. With zero membrane aeration the industrial samples exhibited sludging, the filling of the complete thickness of the membrane channel with sludge solids, whereas for municipal sludge the solids formed a cake layer which did not fill the channel. In the absence of sludging the permeability decline followed the expected pattern of increasing at the elevated soluble COD and capillary suction time values of the industrial sludge, compared with municipal sludge at the same solids concentration range (8-12 g.L-1) However, there was no evident correlation between fouling (permeability decline without sludging) and sludging: incipient sludging did not appear to influence permeability, though can be assumed to negatively impact on long-term operation, or relate to the sCOD concentration. Sludging instead appeared to depend on the sludge physical properties, and primarily the viscosity: sludge samples at high viscosities were found to exhibit a different air-scour pattern to that at normal MLSS concentrations.
   Outcomes suggest that sludging is caused by Theological conditions promoting bubble coalescence and bubble stream constriction, reducing the exposure of the membrane surface to scouring air. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidation processes are impacted by the type, concentration and reactivity of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, the reactions between various types of DOM (Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA), Nordic Reservoir NOM (NNOM) and Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA)) and two oxidants (ozone and chlorine) were studied in the pH range 2-9 by using a combination of optical measurements and electron donating capacities. The relationships between residual electron donating capacity (EDC) and residual absorbance showed a strong pH dependence for the ozone-DOM reactions with phenolic functional groups being the main reacting moieties. Relative EDC and absorbance abatements (UV254 or UV280) were similar at pH 2. At pH 7 or 9, the relative abatement of EDC was more pronounced than for absorbance, which could be explained by the formation of UV-absorbing products such as benzoquinone from the transformation of phenolic moieties. An increase in fluorescence abatement with increasing pH was also observed during ozonation. The increase in fluorescence quantum yields could not be attributed to formation of benzoquinone, but related to a faster abatement of phenolic moieties relative to fluorophores with low ozone reactivity.
   The overall (OH)-O-center dot yields as a result of DOM-induced ozone consumption increased significantly with increasing pH, which could be related to the higher reactivity of phenolic moieties at higher pH. The (OH)-O-center dot yields for SRFA and PLFA were proportional to the phenolic contents, whereas for NNOM, the (OH)-O-center dot yield was about 30% higher.
   During chlorination of DOM at pH 7 an efficient relative EDC abatement was observed whereas the relative absorbance abatement was much less pronounced. This is due to the formation of chlorophenolic moieties, which exert a significant absorbance, and partly lose their electron donating capacity.
   Pre-ozonation of SRFA leads to a decrease of chloroform and haloacetic acid formation, however, only after a threshold of > similar to 50% abatement of the EDC and under conditions which are not precursor limited. The decrease in chloroform and haloacetic acid formation after the threshold EDC abatement was proportional to the relative residual EDC. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human urine is a valuable resource for nutrient recovery, given its high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, but the compositional complexity of urine presents a challenge for an energy-efficient concentration and refinery of nutrients. In this study, a pilot installation combining precipitation, nitrification and electrodialysis (ED), designed for one person equivalent (1.2 L-urine d(-l)), was continuously operated for similar to 7 months. First, NaOH addition yielded calcium and magnesium precipitation, preventing scaling in ED. Second, a moving bed biofilm reactor oxidized organics, preventing downstream biofouling, and yielded complete nitrification on diluted urine (20-40%, i.e. dilution factors 5 and 2.5) at an average loading rate of 215 mg N L-1 d(-1). Batch tests demonstrated the halotolerance of the nitrifying community, with nitrification rates not affected up to an electrical conductivity of 40 mS cm(-1) and gradually decreasing, yet ongoing, activity up to 96 mS cm(-1) at 18% of the maximum rate. Next-generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that switching from a synthetic influent to real urine induced a profound shift in microbial community and that the AOB community was dominated by halophilic species closely related to Nitrosomonas aestuarii and Nitrosomonas marina. Third, nitrate, phosphate and potassium in the filtered (0.1 mu m) bioreactor effluent were concentrated by factors 43, 2.6 and 4.6, respectively, with ED. Doubling the urine concentration from 20% to 40% further increased the ED recovery efficiency by similar to 10%. Batch experiments at pH 6, 7 and 8 indicated a more efficient phosphate transport to the concentrate at pH 7. The newly proposed three-stage strategy opens up opportunities for energy- and chemical-efficient nutrient recovery from urine. Precipitation and nitrification enabled the long-term continuous operation of ED on fresh urine requiring minimal maintenance, which has, to the best of our knowledge, never been achieved before.

AB Pathogen contamination is a major cause of surface water impairment in the United States, and fecal bacteria levels are typically used to evaluate microbial loading in bodies of water. Environmental models are considered a useful tool for evaluating watershed management practices. In this study, we assessed E. coli contamination of the Upper Stroubles Creek, Virginia, USA using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The study area has been declared an impaired body of water due to recent bacterial contamination. Bacterial source characterizations play a critical role in such modeling exercises and especially in the case of non-point sources. As the SWAT model involves bacteria load estimation at a Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) level, we use the Spatially Explicit Load Enrichment Calculation Tool (SELECT) for our E. coli load estimations. We also evaluate current approaches to the measurement of bacterial interactions of the sediment-water interface using SWAT and the frequent measurements of streambed E. coli concentrations. For the simulation of in-stream E. coli concentrations using estimates drawn from SELECT without (with) sediment bacteria resuspension-deposition, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of -0.41 to 0.34 (-0.19 to 0.36) are found. Moreover, in-stream E. coli concentrations measured at flow duration intervals show that the model frequently overestimates mid-range flows while underestimating low-range flows even with model improvements. The use of high-resolution E. coli loads and the consideration of sediment bacteria resuspension-deposition processes, generated higher E. coli concentrations for forested areas compared to those of urban and pasture lands, suggesting the importance of using detailed bacteria load estimations and land use information when assessing E. coli distribution in the environment.

AB Cellulose represents a significant fraction of domestic wastewater, but it is not considered as a separate state variable in the conventional Activated Sludge Models (ASM). Cellulose is a very slowly degradable substrate that in traditional wastewater characterisation methods would be characterised partly as slowly biodegradable and partly as inert material. This can be problematic when the same model is used under different temperature conditions or different solid retention times. Also with the emerging attention for cellulose recovery, inclusion of this compound in models helps to assess the impact of cellulose recovery on operations and on operational costs. But also in membrane bioreactors, sieves are used in order to remove fibrous material, mainly cellulose. In this study a modification of ASM1 is proposed, where cellulose is introduced as a separate state variable and it is supposed to degrade with a first order hydrolysis rate. With the aid of this model, the effect of fine sieves is simulated using two alternatives, by either sieving the influent or the activated sludge. The model proved to be useful for operational purposes, and illustrates the need for including cellulose as separate state variable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Onsite runoff control is considered an important part of sustainable urban drainage schemes, but estimating the maximum runoff flow rate from a catchment with onsite runoff controls remains controversial. Runoff controls complicate the issue by dividing the catchment into several subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls, which dynamically regulate the catchment imperviousness. Rational Method (RM) is the most-employed technique to determine maximum flow rates for designing urban drainage infrastructures, but it cannot handle such conditions. Nonetheless, it has advantages over alternative methods in terms of principle from the urban drainage design perspective. This work develops Rational Method Prime (RMP) that follows the basic principle of RM but instead recalculates catchment variables by taking into account runoff control effects and evaluates runoff control efficiencies by using two indices. RMP has three merits: (1) providing an integrated response of the whole catchment with runoff controls; (2) interpreting runoff control effects by plotting runoff flow rate-rainfall duration curves; (3) connecting the design of runoff controls and storm sewers that are based on different design principles and rainfall statistics. Case study results showed that runoff controls reduced peak flow rates by 5.83-91.6%, corresponding to reduction factors for return period of maximum flow rate from 0.04 to 0.76. Indeed, the original RM is based on four assumptions, which also cause its weakness, and there have been current methods to address 3 of them. RMP contributes to addressing the last assumption (i.e. constant catchment imperviousness), which finally allowing the evolution from RM 1.0 to 2.0. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anaerobic digestion is one of the most promising technologies to stabilize waste-activated sludge (WAS) and recover energy. However, the low efficiency of anaerobic digestion of WAS constrains its application. Supplementing zero valent iron (ZVI) and Fe3O4 in digesters could improve the sludge digestion performance, which has recently been extensively studied. However, the mechanisms behind this improvement remain unclear. In this study, the effects of ZVI and Fe3O4 on the four stages of anaerobic digestion of WAS (solubilization, hydrolysis, acidification and methanogenesis) were investigated. Results showed that ZVI had only a slight effect on the solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification processes, while ZVI significantly promoted the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, increasing methane production by 70%. Further investigation indicated that coenzyme F420 activity in the ZVI added reactor was 32.3% higher than in the blank. These results indicate that ZVI promoted anaerobic digestion of WAS through promoting hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. On the other hand, Fe3O4 obviously promoted the solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification of sludge. Vast Fe2+ was detected in the aqueous phase of the Fe3O4 digester which was a result of dissimilatory iron reduction that can utilize complicated matter as a substrate. This was in agreement with the acceleration of the solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification of the sludge. However, the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with Fe3O4 decreased by 27% and 22% compared to the Fe3O4-free digester, respectively. Further study indicated that Fe3O4 competed with CH3 square S square CoM for electrons and thus inhibited the methanogenesis process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Complete biodegradation and mineralization of pentachlorophenol (PCP), a priority pollutant in water, is challenging for water treatment. In this study, a hydrogen (H-2)-based membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) was applied to treat PCP, along with nitrate and sulfate, which often coexist in contaminated ground-water. Throughout 120-days of continuous operation, almost 100% of up to 10 mg/L PCP was removed with minimal intermediate accumulation and in parallel with complete denitrification of 20 mg-N/L nitrate. PCP initially was reductively dechlorinated to phenol, which was then mineralized to CO2 through pathways that began with aerobic activation via monooxygenation by Xanthobacter and anaerobic activation via carboxylation by Azospira and Thauera. Sulfur cycling induced by SOi(4)(2-) reduction affected the microbial community: The dominant bacteria became sulfate-reducers Desulfomicrobium, sulfur-oxidizers Sulfuritalea and Flavobacterium. This study provides insights and a promising technology for bioremediation of water contaminated with PCP, nitrate, and sulfate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High-silica zeolites have been found to be effective adsorbents for the removal of organic micro pollutants (OMPs) from impaired water, including various pharmaceuticals, personal care products, industrial chemicals, etc. In this review, the properties and fundamentals of high-silica zeolites are summarised. Recent research on mechanisms and efficiencies of OMP adsorption by high-silica zeolites are reviewed to assess the potential opportunities and challenges for the application of high-silica zeolites for OMP adsorption in water treatment. It is concluded that the adsorption capacities are well-related to surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and structural features, e.g. micropore volume and pore size of high-silica zeolites, as well as the properties of OMPs. By using high-silica zeolites, the undesired competitive adsorption of background organic matter (BOM) in natural water could potentially be prevented. In addition, oxidative regeneration could be applied on-site to restore the adsorption capacity of zeolites for OMPs and prevent the toxic residues from re-entering the environment.

AB To better understand the environmental impact of ubiquitous perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in waters, reliable and robust measurement techniques are needed. As one of the most widely used passive sampling approaches, diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) is not only easy to handle but also provides time-weighted analyte concentrations. Based on DGT with XAD18 as a binding agent, we developed a new methodology to measure two frequently detected PFASs in surface waters and wastewaters, i.e. perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Their diffusion coefficients in the diffusive gel, measured using an independent diffusion cell, were 4.37 x 10(-6) and 5.08 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) at 25 degrees C, respectively. DGT had a high capacity for PFOA and PFOS at 196 and 246 mu g per gel disk, suggesting the DGT sampler was suitable for deployment of several weeks. Time-integrated concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in a natural lake and river, and a municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent using DGT samplers deployed in situ for 12-33 d were comparable to those measured by a solid-phase extraction method coupled with high-frequency grab sampling. This study demonstrates that DGT is an effective tool for in situ monitoring of PFASs in natural waters and wastewaters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale studies are needed to identify the drivers of total mercury (THg) and monomethyl-mercury (MeHg) concentrations in aquatic ecosystems. Studies attempting to link dissolved organic matter (DOM) to levels of THg or MeHg are few and geographically constrained. Additionally, stream and river systems have been understudied as compared to lakes. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the influence of DOM concentration and composition, morphological descriptors, land uses and water chemistry on THg and MeHg concentrations and the percentage of THg as MeHg (%MeHg) in 29 streams across Europe spanning from 41 degrees N to 64 degrees N. THg concentrations (0.06-2.78 ng L-1) were highest in streams characterized by DOM with a high terrestrial soil signature and low nutrient content. MeHg concentrations (7.8-159 pg L-1) varied non-systematically across systems. Relationships between DOM bulk characteristics and THg and MeHg suggest that while soil derived DOM inputs control THg concentrations, autochthonous DOM (aquatically produced) and the availability of electron acceptors for Hg methylating microorganisms (e.g. sulfate) drive %MeHg and potentially MeHg concentration. Overall, these results highlight the large spatial variability in THg and MeHg concentrations at the European scale, and underscore the importance of DOM composition on mercury cycling in fluvial systems.

AB Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) is becoming an increasingly important source of potable water in arid and semi-arid regions worldwide. Discharge of brine-effluent from desalination facilities has been shown to significantly impact coastal marine ecosystems ranging from seagrass meadows to microbial communities. In this study, we examined the impacts of increased salinity (10% above ambient) and presence of antiscalants (0.2 mg L-1, polyphosphonate-based) on three reef-building coral species; Stylophora pistillate, Acropora tenuis and Pocillopora verrucosa, from the Gulf of Aqaba (northern Red-Sea). Our results indicate that the corals, as well as associated bacteria and algae, were significantly impaired by the elevated salinity and antiscalants, leading to partial bleaching. Specifically, the abundance of bacteria and symbiotic algae as well as calcification rates were typically lower (20-85%, 50-90% and 40-50%, respectively) following incubations with both amendments. However, the impact of desalination brine was often species-specific. Thus, we propose that the ecotoxicological criteria used for hard corals should be determined based on the sensitivity of key species in the community dominating the area affected by desalination discharge.

AB We examine how core professional and institutional actors in the innovation system conceptualize climate change adaptation in regards to pluvial flooding-and how this influences innovation. We do this through a qualitative case study in Copenhagen with interconnected research rounds, including 32 semi structured interviews, to strengthen the interpretation and analysis of qualitative data. We find that the term "climate change adaptation" currently has no clearly agreed definition in Copenhagen; instead, different actors use different conceptualizations of climate change adaptation according to the characteristics of their specific innovation and implementation projects. However, there is convergence among actors towards a new cognitive paradigm, whereby economic goals and multifunctionality are linked with cost-benefit analyses for adapting to extreme rain events on a surface water catchment scale. Differences in definitions can lead to both successful innovation and to conflict, and thus they affect the city's capacity for change. Our empirical work suggests that climate change adaptation can be characterized according to three attributes: event magnitudes (everyday, design, and extreme), spatial scales (small/local, medium/urban, and large/national-international), and (a wide range of) goals, thereby resulting in different technology choices.

AB Free-living amoebae (FLA) are phagocytic protozoa found in natural and engineered water systems. They can form disinfectant-resistant cysts, which can harbor various human pathogenic bacteria, therefore providing them with a means of environmental persistence and dispersion through water distribution and other engineered water systems. The association of FLA with human viruses has been raised, but the limited data on the persistence of infectious virions within amoebae leaves this aspect unresolved. Enteroviruses can cause a wide range of illness and replicate in human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, both of which could be exposed through contact with contaminated waters if virus detection and removal are compromised by virion internalization in free-living protozoa. This is especially problematic for high-risk contaminants, such as coxsackieviruses, representative members of the Enterovirus genus that are likely infectious at low doses and cause a variety of symptoms to a vulnerable portion of the population (particularly infants). To investigate Enterovirus persistence within free-living amoebae we co-cultured an infectious clinical coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5) isolate, with the commonly reported tap water amoeba Vermamoeba vermiformis, after which we tracked virus localization and persistence in co-culture over time through a combination of advanced imaging, molecular and cell culture assays. Our results clearly demonstrate that infectious CVB5 can persist in all life stages of the amoebae without causing any visible injury to them. We also demonstrated that the amoeba generated vesicles containing virions that were expelled into the bulk liquid surroundings, a finding previously described for FLA-bacteria interactions, but not for FLA and human pathogenic viruses. Therefore, our findings suggest that the ability of CVB5 to persist in V. vermiformis could be a novel waterborne risk pathway for the persistence and dispersion of infectious human enteric viruses through water systems.

AB Water and energy are key sustainability issues that need to be addressed. Photocatalysis represents an attractive means to not only remediate polluted waters, but also harness solar energy. Unfortunately, the employment of photocatalysts remains a practical challenge in terms of high cost, low efficiency, secondary pollution and unexploited water matrices influence. This study investigated the feasibility of photocatalysis to both treat water and produce hydrogen with practical water systems. Polymeric carbon nitride foam (CNF) with large surface area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the bubble-template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal condensation. The reaction kinetics, mechanisms, and effect of natural water matrices and wastewater on CNF-based photocatalytic removal of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the efficiency of clean hydrogen energy from natural water matrices and wastewater was also evaluated. It was found that the photocatalytic performance of CNF for TC-HCl removal was principally affected by calcination temperature in the presence of NH4Cl. The degradation rates of CNF-4 (calcined at 550 degrees C) were approximately 1.84, 2.49 and 7.47 times than that of the CNF-2 (calcined at 600 degrees C), CNF-1 (calcined at 500 degrees C) and GCN (without NH4Cl), respectively. Results indicate that the improved photocatalytic performance was predominantly ascribed to the large specific surface area, increased availability of exposed active sites, and enhanced transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier. Based on electron spin resonance, chemical trapping experiment and density functional theory calculation, photoinduced oxidizing species (center dot O-2(-) and holes) initially attacked the C-N-C fragment of TC molecules, which were finally mineralized to CO2, water and inorganic matters. Under the synergistic influence of water constituents (including acidity and alkalinity, ion species and dissolved organic substances), various water matrices greatly affected the degradation rate of TC-HCI, with the highest removal efficiency of 78.9% in natural seawater, followed by reservoir water (75.0%), tap water (62.3%), deionized water (49.8%), reverse osmosis concentrate (32.7%) and pharmaceutical wastewater (18.9%). Interestingly, low amounts of the emerging microplastics slightly improved TC-HCl removal, whereas high amounts (1.428 x 10(7) P/cm(3)) restricted removal due to light absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction. Moreover, the photocatalysts were able over repeated usage. Notably, the hydrogen yields rates of polymeric carbon nitride foam were 352.2, 299.8, 184.9 and 94.3 mu mol/g/h in natural seawater, pharmaceutical wastewater, water from reservoir and tap water, respectively. This study proves the potential of novel nonmetal porous photocatalyst to simultaneously treat wastewater while converting solar energy into clean hydrogen energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Stable isotope probing (SIP) is a cultivation-independent approach identifying the functional microbes in their natural habitats, possibly linking their identities to functions. DNA-SIP is well-established but suffers from the shift of C-12-DNA into the heavy DNA (C-13-DNA) fraction, which significantly reduces the resolution and accuracy. In this study, we coupled magnetic-nanoparticle mediated isolation (MMI) and DNA-SIP, namely MMI-SIP, to identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation from PAH-contaminated wastewater. Microbes affiliated to Pseudomonas and Sphingobium were responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism from the SIP results, and Pigmentiphaga was only unraveled for phenanthrene degradation in the MMI and MMI-SIP microcosms. MMI-SIP also significantly increased the enrichment of the above microbes and genes encoding the alpha subunit of the PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD alpha) in the heavy DNA fractions. Our findings suggest that MMI-SIP is a powerful tool, with higher resolution and accuracy, to distinguish the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism in the wastewater, provide a more precise map of functional microbial communities, and offer suggestions for effective management for wastewater treatment plants.

AB In the presented study, electrochemical oxidation of five anticancer drugs (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), ifosfamide (IF), cyclophosphamide (CF), methotrexate (MTX), imatinib (IMB)) using boron doped diamond (BDD) electrode was investigated. In the first step the operating parameters of electrolysis were optimized. Studies have demonstrated a significant influence of applying current density, temperature, pH of solution and initial concentration of 5-FU on the process efficiency. A comparison of the decomposition rate of all the tested drugs showed a decrease in the pseudo-first order rate constants in the following order: k(IMB) > k(MTX) > k(CF) approximate to k(IF) > k(5-FU). Mineralization current efficiency (MCE) was determined for all the drugs based on the removal amount of total organic carbon (TOC) and their values decreased in the same order as values of drug degradation rate k. Based on the identified degradation products, electrochemical oxidation pathways of the decomposed drugs were proposed. In the case of CF, IF and 5-FU the degradation process occurred mainly through ketonization, hydroxylation and dehalogenation, while MTX and IMB were decomposed by attack of hydroxyl radicals on benzyl position in parent compounds. An important part of the research was the evaluation of eco-toxicity of electrochemically treated drug solutions against Lemna minor. Toxicity of initial 5-FU and MTX solutions towards L. minor were observed but after electrochemical treatment its toxicity decreased. The opposite trend was observed for CF and IF. In this case no significant toxicity was observed for the initial solutions of these drugs, while after electrochemical treatment an increase in growth inhibition of L. minor was found.

AB Aeration process in the waste activated sludge treatment accounts for 75% of total energy consumption of the treatment plant. The main purpose of the aeration process is to enhance the biodegradation of the liquid waste. Gas bubbles, rising through the liquid, improves mixing, reduces inhomogeneities in the treatment tank and enhances biological reactions. Thus aeration intensity and several physicochemical properties of feed such as viscosity, total suspended solids, and surface charge play a significant role in the biological reaction.
   This paper examines the impact of the gas injection rate on some physicochemical properties of waste activated sludge namely rheological properties, suspended solids, soluble COD (sCOD), surface tension, and zeta potential. The impact of four different gas flow rates on four different concentrations of waste activated sludge properties was analysed.
   The results showed that in linear viscoelastic regime the viscous and elastic modulus decreases linearly with an increase in gas flow rate. The amount of stress imposed by gas injection also showed a direct relationship with gas velocity. Gas injection also showed a substantial impact on soluble COD, suspended solids, and zeta potential. Additionally, a linear relationship was observed between the percentage change in the above mentioned physical properties and stress imposed by gas injection. These results confirm that gas injection produces additional shear impacting sludge physicochemical properties and therefore changes its rheological behaviour. The extra stress induced by gas injection can be predicted using a simple model based on sludge concentration and gas velocity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diphenhydramine (DPH) the active ingredient in Benadryl, has been detected in streams, rivers and other surface water sources. As a bioactive compound, DPH impacts human health even at low concentrations. Ultrasonic irradiation at 640 kHz leads to the rapid degradation of DPH in aqueous solution. Radical scavenging experiments and detailed product studies indicate the DPH degradation involves direct pyrolysis and degradation reactions mediated by the hydroxyl radicals produced during cavitation. The degradation can be modeled by pseudo-first order kinetics yielding rate constants k of 0.210, 0.130, 0.082, 0.050, 0.035, 0.023 min(-1) at the initial concentrations of 2.8, 5.2, 13.9, 27.0, 61.0, 160.0 mu mol L-1, respectively. The degradation process follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (heterogeneous) model with a partition coefficient, KL-H = 0.06 mu mol.L-1 and reactivity constant k(r) = 1.96 mu mol min(-1).L-1. A competition kinetic study conducted employing the hydroxyl radical trap, coumarin, illustrates that DPH was degraded primarily by hydroxyl radical mediated processes. Computational studies employing Gaussian 09 basis set provide fundamental insight into the partitioning of the reaction pathways and the degradation mechanisms. The study demonstrates the ultrasonic degradation of DPH is rapid, follows simple kinetic expressions and is accurately modeled using computational methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present results from field experiments linking hydrology, geochemistry, and microbiology during infiltration at a field site that is used for managed aquifer recharge (MAR). These experiments measured how a horizontal permeable reactive barrier (PRB) made of woodchips impacted subsurface nitrate removal and microbial ecology. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon consistently increased in infiltrating water below the PRB, but not in un-amended native soil. The average nitrate removal rate in soils below the PRB was 1.5 g/m(2)/day NO3-N, despite rapid infiltration (up to 1.9 m/d) and a short fluid residence time within the woodchips (<= 6 h). In contrast, 0.09 g/m(2)/day NO3-N was removed on average in native soil. Residual nitrate in infiltrating water below the PRB was enriched in delta N-15 and delta O-18, with low and variable isotopic enrichment factors that are consistent with denitrification during rapid infiltration. Many putative denitrifying bacteria were significantly enhanced in the soil below a PRB; Methylotenera mobilis and genera Microbacterium, Polaromonas, and Novosphingobium had log(2) fold-changes of +4.9, +5.6, +7.2, and +11.8, respectively. These bacteria were present before infiltration and were not enhanced in native soil. It appears that the woodchip PRB contributed to favorable conditions in the underlying soil for enhanced nitrate removal, quantitatively shifting soil microbial ecology. These results suggest that using a horizontal PRB could improve water quality during rapid infiltration for MAR. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biofiltration systems are highly valued in urban landscapes as they remove pollutants from stormwater runoff whilst contributing to a reduction in runoff volumes. Integrating trees in biofilters may improve their runoff retention performance, as trees have greater transpiration than commonly used sedge or herb species. High transpiration rates will rapidly deplete retained water, creating storage capacity prior to the next runoff event. However, a tree with high transpiration rates in a biofilter system will likely be frequently exposed to drought stress. Selecting appropriate tree species therefore requires an understanding of how different trees use water and how they respond to substrate drying. We selected 20 tree species and quantified evapotranspiration (ET) and drought stress (leaf water potential; Psi) in relation to substrate water content. To compare species, we developed metrics which describe: (i) maximum rates of ET under well-watered conditions, (ii) the sensitivity of ET and (iii) the response of Psi to declining substrate water content. Using these three metrics, we classified species into three groups: risky, balanced or conservative. Risky and balanced species showed high maximum ET, whereas conservative species always had low ET. As substrates dried, the balanced species down-regulated ET to delay the onset of drought stress; whereas risky species did not. Therefore, balanced species with high ET are more likely to improve the retention performance of biofiltration systems without introducing significant drought risk. This classification of tree water use strategies can be easily integrated into water balance models and improve tree species selection for biofiltration systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB While flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) is a potential alternative to brackish and/or sea water desalination, there is limited understanding of both the fate of ions following migration across the ion exchange membranes and the mechanisms responsible for ion separation. In this study, we investigate the desalting performance of an FCDI system operated over a range of conditions. Results show that although ion transport as a result of electrodialysis is inevitable in FCDI (and is principally responsible for pH excursion in the flow electrode), the use of high carbon content ensures that a high proportion of the charge and counterions are retained in the electrical double layers of the flowing carbon particles, even at high charging voltages (e.g., 2.0 V) during the deionization process. Estimation of the portions of sodium and chloride ions adsorbed in the flow electrode after migration through the membranes suggests that the ongoing capacitive adsorption exhibits asymmetric behavior with the anodic particles demonstrating better affinity for CI- (than the cathodic particles for Na+) during electrosorption. These findings provide an explanation for the change in electrode properties that are observed under imperfect adsorption scenarios and provide insight into aspects of the design and operation of flow electrode pairs that is critical to achieving effective desalination by FCDI.

AB Although it is well established that climate warming can reinforce eutrophication in shallow lakes by altering top-down and bottom-up processes in the food web and biogeochemical cycling, recent studies in temperate zones have also shown that adverse effects of rising temperature are diminished in fishless systems. Whereas the removal of zooplanktivorous fish may be useful in attempts to mitigate eutrophication in temperate shallow lakes, it is uncertain whether similar mitigation might be achieved in warmer climates. We compared the responses of zooplankton and phytoplankton communities to climate warming in the presence and absence of fish (Aristichthys nobilis) in a 4-month mesocosm experiment at subtropical temperatures. We hypothesized that 1) fish and phytoplankton would benefit from warming, while zooplankton would suffer in fish-present mesocosms and 2) warming would favor zooplankton growth but reduce phytoplankton biomass in fish-absent mesocosms. Our results showed significant interacting effects of warming and fish presence on both phytoplankton and zooplankton. In mesocosms with fish, biomasses of fish and phytoplankton increased in heated treatments, while biomasses of Daphnia and total zooplankton declined. Warming reduced the proportion of large Daphnia in total zooplankton biomass, and reduced the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio, but increased the ratio of chlorophyll a to total phosphorus, indicating a relaxation of zooplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton. Meanwhile, warming resulted in a 3-fold increase in TP concentrations in the mesocosms with fish present. The results suggest that climate warming has the potential to boost eutrophication in shallow lakes via both top-down (loss of herbivores) and bottom-up (elevated nutrient) effects. However, in the mesocosms without fish, there was no decline in large Daphnia or in total zooplankton biomass, supporting the conclusion that fish predation is the major driver of low large Daphnia abundance in warm lakes. In the fishless mesocosms, phytoplankton biomass and nutrient levels were not affected by temperature. Our study suggests that removing fish to mitigate warming effects on eutrophication may be potentially beneficial in subtropical lakes, though the rapid recruitment of fish in such lakes may present a challenge to success in the long-term.

AB Phosphate recovery from sewage sludge is essential in a circular economy. Currently, the main focus in centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) lies on struvite recovery routes, land application of sludge or on technologies that rely on sludge incineration. These routes have several disadvantages. Our study shows that the mineral vivianite, Fe-2(PO4)(3) x 8H(2)O, is present in digested sludge and can be the major form of phosphate in the sludge. Thus, we suggest vivianite can be the nucleus for alternative phosphate recovery options. Excess and digested sewage sludge was sampled from full-scale MWTPs and analysed using x-ray diffraction (XRD), conventional scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), environmental SEM-EDX (eSEM-EDX) and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Vivianite was observed in all plants where iron was used for phosphate removal. In excess sludge before the anaerobic digestion, ferrous iron dominated the iron pool (>= 50%) as shown by Mossbauer spectroscopy. XRD and Mossbauer spectroscopy showed no clear correlation between vivianite bound phosphate versus the iron content in excess sludge. In digested sludge, ferrous iron was the dominant iron form (>85%). Phosphate bound in vivianite increased with the iron content of the digested sludge but levelled off at high iron levels. 70-90% of all phosphate was bound in vivianite in the sludge with the highest iron content (molar Fe:P = 2.5). The quantification of vivianite was difficult and bears some uncertainty probably because of the presence of impure vivianite as indicated by SEM-EDX. eSEM-EDX indicates that the vivianite occurs as relatively small (20-100 mu m) but free particles. We envisage very efficient phosphate recovery technologies that separate these particles based on their magnetic properties from the complex sludge matrix. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge-driven management for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) performance becomes increasingly important considering the globally growing production of wastewater and the rising demand of clean water supply. Even though the potential of microbial organisms (bacteria and protists) as bioindicators for WWTP performance is well known, it is far from being fully exploited for routine monitoring programs. Therefore, we here used massive sequencing of environmental (e)DNA metabarcodes from bacterial (V3-V4 region of the SSU rRNA gene) and eukaryote (V9 region of the SSU rRNA gene) communities in 21 activated sludge samples obtained from full-scale municipal WWTPs in Germany. Microbial community patterns were compared to standard WWTP operating parameters and two traditionally used WWTP performance indicators (Sludge Biotic Index and Sludge Index). Both indices showed low concordance and hardly correlated with chemical WWTP performance parameters nor did they correlate with microbial community structures. In contrast, microbial community profiles significantly correlated with WWTP performance parameters and operating conditions of the plants under study. Therefore, eDNA metabarcode profiles of whole microbial communities indicate the performance of WWTP and can provide useful information for management strategies. We here suggest a strategy for the development of an eDNA metabarcode based bioindicator system, which can be implemented in future standard monitoring programs for WWTP performance and effluent quality.

AB Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a microbial process that consumes dissolved methane (CH4) in anoxic sediments and soils and mitigates CH4 release to the atmosphere. The degree to which AOM limits global biospheric CH4 emissions is not fully understood. In marine sediments, where the process was first described, AOM is responsible for oxidizing >90% of the CH4 produced. More recently, AOM has been observed in soils, peatlands, and freshwater ecosystems. In lakes, where sediment anoxia, organic carbon turnover, and CH4 production are common, AOM is not well studied but could represent a significant CH4 sink and constraint on emissions. Here, we present evidence for the occurrence of AOM in the sediment of thirteen lakes that span a global climatic and trophic gradient. We further quantified and modeled AOM patterns and studied potential microbial controls of AOM using laboratory incubations of sediment and stable isotope measurements in three of the thirteen lakes. We demonstrate that AOM is widespread in freshwater lake sediments and accounts for 29%-34% (95% confidence interval) of the mean total CH4 produced in surface and near-surface lake sediments.

AB Water scarcity is becoming one of the largest problems worldwide. Agricultural reuse of wastewater has been considered a valuable and reliable alternative, alleviating the pressure on freshwater resources in arid and semi-arid regions such as the Middle East. Inadequate microbial quality of treated wastewater is a challenge for developing countries, which limits agricultural reuse of wastewater. This study assessed the impact of irrigation with secondary treated wastewater (STWW) on soil properties as well as the safety of various types of crops as compared with tap water (TW) irrigation through a furrow system. Total and fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli were monitored as indicator bacteria in STWW, irrigated soil and harvested crops. The presence of pathogenic E. coli O157, Salmonella and Shigella was also monitored in all samples using a combination of culture and molecular methods. The microbial quality of wastewater in terms of E. coli concentration (4.18 Log MPN/100 ml) failed to meet the world health organization (WHO) recommendation for irrigation of root and leafy crops (<= 10(3) and <= 10(4) E. coli per 100 ml for root and leafy crops, respectively). No significant effects on physicochemical properties of the soil irrigated with STWW was found in comparison with control plots, except for electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), which were slightly higher in STWW soil samples. Although the microbial quality of soil was affected by STWW irrigation, a relatively low concentration of E. coli was detected in soil. No microbial contamination in terms of E. coli was found on harvested maize and onion. E. coli contamination of lettuce and spring onion was found for both irrigation schemes. No STWW, soil or crop samples were found positive for pathogenic bacteria. According to the analyzed parameters, STWW could be safely used as an alternative source for irrigation of root and leafy crops. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mariculture activities and river inputs lead to coastal seawaters with DOM levels that are comparable to or even higher than those in terrestrial water bodies. However, effects of seawater DOM, and especially of DOM occurring in areas impacted by mariculture, on photodegradation of organic micropollutants, are largely unknown. In this study, simulated sunlight irradiation experiments were performed to probe the effects of DOM extracted from mariculture impacted seawaters and from offshore areas, on photo degradation of three sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs). Results show that the SAs are transformed mainly by indirect photodegradation induced by triplet excited DOM ((DOM)-D-3*). Compared with DOM from the more pristine coastal waters, the DOM from mariculture impacted areas undergoes less photobleaching, contains higher percentage of humic-like materials and higher proportions of aromatic and carbonyl structures. Thus, the DOM from mariculture areas exhibits higher rates of light absorption, higher formation quantum yields of (DOM)-D-3*, higher (DOM)-D-3* steady-state concentrations and higher reactivity on photodegradation of the SAs. Photochemistry of the seawater DOM is different from that reported for freshwater lake DOM. This study highlights the importance of probing the effects of DOM from coastal seawaters on photodegradation of organic micropollutants since coastal seawaters are sinks of many aquatic pollutants.

AB In this study, for the first time, the occurrence mechanism of anaerobically digested sludge conditioning for dewatering process based on Electrochemical-Fenton technology was investigated and the optimum condition has been determined to employ a lab-scale reactor. Due to the results of current studies using electrochemical and Fenton methods, a comparative economic-technical investigation has been provided accordingly. The results showed that under optimum operational condition by utilizing Electrochemical-Fenton process e.g. H2O2 = 25 mg/g DS (dry solid), Fe2+ = 15 mg/g DS, retention time = 20 min, electrolysis voltage = 11 V, the specific resistance to filterability (SRF) and time to filter (TTF) parameters reduction equal to 93.8% and 75.9% respectively. The occurrence mechanism of the sludge conditioning was determined by evaluation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), particle size distribution, zeta potential and bound water tests. The dry solids concentration of the conditioned sludge by Electrochemical-Fenton process was increased from 2.3% to 41% by dewatering employing filter press system. Furthermore, the estimated cost of conditioning using this method is 41.82 USD$/t DS, which is less than other investigated methods e.g. traditional Fenton process. It can be concluded that the results reached in this comprehensive and comparative study could be a suitable basis for further investigations regarding utilization of novel electrochemical advanced oxidation technologies for efficient sludge conditioning and dewatering purposes.

AB Among available technologies to ensure drinking water security, reverse osmosis (RO) has become the gold-standard for purification due to its maturity and reliability. However, high energy consumption and low water recovery are the major impediments for extensive adoption of RO. Multi-stage RO process is an innovative system design that can offer a more effective way to improve energy efficiency and water recovery, but it is rarely employed for disinfection by-product (DBP) treatment in drinking water. Thus, this study applied multi-stage RO to treat water containing haloacetic acids (HAAs), a prevalent class of DBPs with widespread occurrence and high toxicity, under a variety of environmental and operational conditions. Overall, we found that >75% HAAs were rejected and 87% of water was recovered with a five-stage RO process. For compounds with identical number of halogen substitutions, iodinated, brominated, and chlorinated HAAs were almost equally removed; however, highly halogenated species were easier to be rejected than lowly halogenated HAAs. By developing quantitative structure-activity relationship models, the importance of size exclusion, charge repulsion, and hydrophobic interaction effects on multi-stage RO removal was revealed. Environmental and operational variables like pH, operating pressure, water matrix, and membrane age also played important roles in this process. Increasing pH from 6.5 to 8.5 and membrane age apparently enhanced HAA rejections. In contrast, HAA rejection increased only slightly from an operating pressure of 4-6 bars but decreased markedly from 6 to 8 bars. Compared to ultrapure water, equal or higher removal efficiency was observed for HAAs spiked to tap water. Considering the need to balance water quality and quantity, a four-stage RO was preferred under this study's condition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microplastics are a global concern for their threat to marine ecosystems. Recent studies report a lack of smaller microplastics (<300 mu m) in oceans attributed to a "loss in ocean". Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the absence of smaller microplastics, but their fate and transport remain an enigma. Our study recovered high concentrations of microplastics (32947 +/- 15342 items kg(-1) dry sediment) from sediments of a coastal plain river network in eastern China, with the <300 mu m fraction accounting for similar to 85% of total microplastic particles. Microplastic concentrations were generally higher in sediments from tributary streams and streams surrounded by industrial land use. The high variability of microplastics within the watershed indicates that the distribution of microplastics is regulated by several factors, such as distance to source(s), river flow characteristics, buoyancy behavior, degradation, etc. Fragment and foam forms dominated the small microplastics, while fibers were less prevalent in the <300 mu m fraction and more abundant in downstream sites. The dominance of small microplastics in riverine sediments in this study provides a possible mechanism to explain the relative absence of small microplastics in the ocean, and advocates for quantification of the whole size spectrum of microplastics in future studies of riverine microplastic fluxes.

AB The removal efficiency of 6 micro-grain AC (mu GAC) was examined for 23 selected pharmaceutical compounds, usually found at trace level in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Two different sets of experiments were carried out using distilled water and a real WWTP secondary effluent in order to understand the adsorption mechanisms of pharmaceuticals, including the role of the presence of background organic matter. Physical and chemical properties of mu GACs and target pollutants were checked for their potential to predict the pharmaceutical removal. Textural properties of mu GACs, and especially the mesopore volume, seemed to play the most important role during the adsorption without background organic matter whereas the chemistry of the mu GACs, such as the presence of surface oxygen groups and the point of zero charge, could have more influence in the experiments with WWTP effluent water. Positively charged molecules are better adsorbed due to the influence of the background organic matter and the presence of oxygenated groups in the surface of the mu GACs. The UV254 removal correlated well with the pharmaceutical removal and it is confirmed as an indicator to control the performance of pharmaceuticals adsorption with mu GACs in tertiary treatment.

AB Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are used to assess fecal pollution levels in surface water and are among the criteria used by regulatory agencies to determine water body impairment status. While FIB provide no information about pollution source, microbial source tracking (MST) does, which contributes to more direct and cost effective remediation efforts. We studied a watershed in Florida managed for wildlife conservation that historically exceeded the state regulatory guideline for fecal coliforms. We measured fecal coliforms, enterococci, a marker gene for avian feces (GFD), and a marker gene for human associated Bacteroides (HF183) in sediment, vegetation, and water samples collected monthly from six sites over two years to: 1) assess the influence of site, temporal factors, and habitat (sediment, vegetation, and water) on FIB and MST marker concentrations, 2) test for correlations among FIB and MST markers, and 3) determine if avian feces and/or human sewage contributed to FIB levels. Sediment and vegetation had significantly higher concentrations of FIB and GFD compared to water and thus may serve as microbial reservoirs, providing unreliable indications of recent contamination. HF183 concentrations were greatest in water samples but were generally near the assay limit of detection. HF183-positive results were attributed to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) feces, which provided a false indication of human sewage in this water body. FIB and GFD were positively correlated while FIB and HF183 were negatively correlated. We demonstrated that birds, not sewage, were the main source of FIB, thus avoiding implementation of a total maximum daily load program (TMDL). Our results demonstrate that the concomitant use of FIB and MST can improve decision-making and provide direction when water bodies are impaired, and provides a strategy for natural source exclusion in water bodies impacted by wild animal feces.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic environment significantly influences the behavior and fate of heavy metals via binding, complexation and thus changes the metal speciation; however detailed interfacial processes and mechanisms are still unclear. Here, differential absorbance and fluorescence spectra and two dimensional UV-FTIR heterospectral correlation analysis were applied to probe into the Pb(II)-DOM interaction at a wide range of pH and ionic strength (IS). The absorbance of DOM molecules under all conditions increased with metal addition, while the different extents of absorbance variations along the wavelength range in the differential zero-order and log-transformed absorbance spectra indicated the site heterogeneity within the DOM pool for metal binding. Spectral parameters, namely differential fluorescent components 1 and 2 (DFC1 and DFC2) and differential slopes of log-transformed absorbance in the range of wavelength 350-400 nm (DSlope(350-400)) were found to be highly correlated with the total amounts of DOM-bound Pb(II) predicted by the NICA-Donnan model, while the differential absorbance spectra at 235 nm (DA(235)) was related to the extent of Pb(II) bound by carboxylic groups. Thus, these parameters are an indicator or proxy for the in situ Pb(II)-DOM interaction extent. Aryl C-H gave the fastest response to Pb(II) binding at lower pH and IS (e.g., pH 4.7 and IS = 0.01 M), followed by carboxyl C=O and polysaccharide C-OH and then chromophoric groups at 265 nm (CDOM265). However, the CDOM265 bound to Pb(II) prior to aryl C-H and polysaccharide C-OH groups at higher pH and IS (6.0 and 0.1 M, respectively), showing that the binding sequences were highly dependent on solution chemistry. Differential spectra combined with two dimensional UV-FTIR heterospectral correlation analysis can be used as a promising approach to elucidate metal-DOM interaction processes, including site heterogeneity, binding sensitivity and sequence at the functional group level.

AB Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of persistent contaminants that have been identified throughout the aquatic environment. In this study, ten targeted perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), three targeted PFAA precursors, and non-targeted PFAA precursors were monitored in four full and pilot-scale potable reuse plants at each stage of advanced treatment. Non-targeted PFAA precursors were quantified by applying a total oxidizable precursor assay in which PFAA precursors are oxidized by hydroxyl radicals to targeted PFAAs. Two of the potable reuse systems had membrane-based treatments with reverse osmosis and UV-advanced oxidation (RO-UV/AOP) and two used ozone, biological activated carbon filtration and granular activated carbon adsorption (O-3-BAC-GAC). The total targeted PFAAs in the four tertiary effluents, the influent sources for the potable reuse systems, ranged from 52 to 227 ng/L with non-targeted PFAA precursors accounting for 30-67% of total PFASs on a molar basis. The RO-UV/AOP treatment trains reduced PFAAs and PFAA precursors to below their method reporting limits through the barrier provided by RO. The O-3-BAC-GAC based treatment trains reduced, but did not completely remove PFAAs or PFAA precursors and the PFASs present in the product water were primarily shorter-chain PFAAs, some of which lack human health guidance values for drinking water. The relative fraction of targeted shorter-chain PFAAs increased after each treatment step indicating that there was preferential removal of the PFAA precursors and longer-chain PFAAs. This study provides new insight on the concentrations and treatment of PFAA precursors through potable reuse treatment systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over four billion people are discharging untreated human excreta into the environment without any prior treatment, causing eutrophication and spreading disease. The most nutrient rich fraction is the urine. Urine can be collected separately and dehydrated in an alkaline bed producing a nutrient rich fertiliser. However, faecal cross-contamination during the collection risks to introduce pathogens to the urine. The objective of this hygiene assessment was to study the inactivation of five microorganisms (Ascaris suum, Enterococcus faecalis, bacteriophages MS2 and Phi X 174 and Salmonella spp) in alkaline dehydrated urine. Fresh human urine was dehydrated in wood ash at 42 degrees C until the pH decreased to <= 10.5, at which point the saturated ash was inoculated with faeces containing the microorganisms and left open to the air (mimicking stockpiling of the end product) at temperatures of 20 and 42 degrees C. The bacteria and bacteriophages were inactivated to below the detection limit (100 cfu ml(-1) for bacteria; 10 pfu mL(-1) for bacteriophages) within four days storage at 20 degrees C. A. suum inactivation data was fitted to a non-linear regression model, which estimated a required 325 days of storage at 20 degrees C and 9.2 days at 42 degrees C to reach a 3 log(10) reduction. However, the urine dehydration in itself achieved a concentration <1 A. suum per 4g of dehydrated medium which fulfil the WHO guidelines for unrestricted use. (C)2018 The Authors.

AB Climate change and urbanization are key factors affecting the future of water quality in urbanized catchments. The work reported in this paper is an evaluation of the combined and relative impact of climate change and urbanization on the water quality of receiving water bodies in the context of a highly urbanized watershed served by a combined sewer system (CSS) in northern Italy. The impact is determined by an integrated modelling study involving two years of field campaigns. The results obtained from the case study show that impervious urban surfaces and rainfall intensity are significant predictors of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and consequently of the water quality of the receiving water body. Scenarios for the year 2100 demonstrate that climate change combined with increasing urbanization is likely to lead to severe worsening of river water quality due to a doubling of the total phosphorus load from CSOs compared to the current load. Reduction in imperviousness was found to be a suitable strategy to adapt to these scenarios by limiting the construction of new impervious areas and decreasing the existing areas by only 15%. This information can be further utilized to develop future designs, which in turn should make these systems more resilient to future changes in climate and urbanization. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work reports the application of photocatalytic disinfection to the inactivation of Acanthamoeba trophozoites, a free-living pathogenic amoeba. Two types of photocatalytic reactors configurations have been used: i) a slurry reactor using suspended titanium dioxide (TiO2); and, ii) a fixed-bed reactor using immobilized TiO2 onto glass Raschig rings. The effect of the chemical composition of water has been analysed, comparing the efficiency of the process in deionized water (DW) and synthetic wastewater treatment plant effluent (SWTPE). The inactivation of Acanthamoeba spp. has been compared to that of Escherichia coli bacteria, being also analysed the concomitant inactivation of both microorganisms. Our results show that 99% of inactivation of E. colt and Acanthamoeba spp. can be achieved using photo catalysis in both reactor configurations, but interestingly, the kinetics of inactivation of both microorganisms together differs from that found with them separately. Particularly, E. coli seems to be more resistant to the inactivation in the presence of Acanthamoeba spp. which has been justified by the screen effect caused by the bigger size of Acanthamoeba spp. This observation is more pronounced in DW as the composition of the SWTPE prevent the microorganisms from suffering osmotic and/or mechanical stress and protect cellular structures to the attack of reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand, the difference between the inactivation rate of E. coil and Acanthamoeba, points out the importance of the different inactivation mechanisms, suggesting that the entry of small TiO2 particles into the cytoplasm of the Acanthamoeba cells provokes the attack of inner structures and as a consequence a faster inactivation. This mechanism is not possible when the catalyst is immobilized leading to a higher cell resistance to inactivation and consequently lower efficiency of the disinfection process.

AB Oxygen inhibits anammox, a bioconversion executed by anoxic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB). Nonetheless, oxygen is mostly found in the proximity of AnAOB in nitrogen removal applications, being a substrate for nitritation. The experiments performed to date were mostly limited to batch activity tests where AnAOB activity is estimated during oxygen exposure. However, little attention has been paid to the recovery and reversibility of activity following aerobic conditions, of direct relevance for bioreactor operation. In this work, anoxic and autotrophic reactor cultivation at 20 degrees C yielded an enriched microbial community in AnAOB, consisting for 75% of a member of the genus Brocadia. High-resolution kinetic data were obtained with online ammonium measurements and further processed with a newly developed Python data pipeline. The experimentally obtained AnAOB response showed complete inhibition until micro-aerobic conditions were reached again (<0.02 mg O-2 L-1). After oxygen inhibition, AnAOB recovered gradually, with recovery times of 5-37 h to reach a steady-state activity, dependent on the perceived inhibition. The recovery immediately after inhibition was lowest when exposed to higher oxygen concentrations (range: 0.5-8 mg O-2 L-1) with long contact times (range: 9-24 h). The experimental data did not fit well with a conventional 'instant recovery' Monod-type inhibition model. Yet, the fit greatly improved by incorporating a dynamic growth rate formula accurately describing gradual activity recovery. With the upgraded model, long-term kinetic simulations for partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) with intermittent aeration showed a decrease in growth rate compared to the instant recovery mode. These results indicate that recovery of AnAOB after oxygen exposure was previously overlooked. It is recommended to account for this effect in the intensification of partial nitritation/anammox.

AB Knowledge of the dynamic changes in molecular size of natural colloidal organic matter (COM) along the aquatic continuum is of vital importance for a better understanding of the environmental fate and ecological role of dissolved organic matter and associated contaminants in aquatic systems. We report here the pH- and cation-dependent size variations of COMs with different sources (river and lake) quantified using flow field-flow fractionation (FIFFF), fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and zeta potential analysis. Increasing pH caused a decline in molecular sizes and an obvious size transformation from the >10 kDa to 5-10 kDa and further to 1-5 kDa size fraction, whereas the opposite trend was observed for increasing cation (e.g., Ca2+ and Cu2+) abundance. Compared with lakewater COM, the riverwater COM exhibited a greater pH-dependent dispersion but less extent in cation-induced aggregation, demonstrating that the dispersion and aggregation dynamics were highly dependent on COM source and solution chemistry (e.g., pH and cations). Based on ATR FTIR analysis, the extensive dissolution of C=O and C-O functional groups resulted in a greater pH-dependent dispersion for river COM. Fluorescence titration revealed that, despite their similar cation-induced aggregation behavior, the binding constants of all the PARAFAC-derived components for Cu2+ were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those for Ca2+ (logK(M): 4.54-5.45 vs. 3.35-3.70), indicating a heterogeneous nature in cation-DOM interactions. The greater extent of decline in zeta potential for lake COM suggested a Ca-induced charge neutralization and aggregation mechanism. However, for Cu-induced aggregation, chemical complexation was the predominant pathway for the river COM, with higher binding constants, while charge neutralization and chemical complexation co-induced the aggregation of lake COM. Thus, natural COMs may have different environmental behavior along the aquatic continuum and further affect the fate and transport of contaminants in aquatic environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over 1/3 of the global population lacks access to improved sanitation, leading to disease, death, and impaired economic development. Our group is working to develop rapidly deployable, cost-effective, and sustainable solutions to this global problem that do not require significant investments in infrastructure. Previously, we demonstrated the feasibility of a toilet system that recycles blackwater for onsite reuse as flush water, in which the blackwater is electrochemically treated to remove pathogens due to fecal contamination. However, this process requires considerable energy (48-93 kJ/L) to achieve complete disinfection of the process liquid, and the disinfected liquid retains color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in excess of local discharge standards, negatively impacting user acceptability. Granular activated carbon (GAC) efficiently reduces COD in concentrated wastewaters. We hypothesized that reduction of COD with GAC prior to electrochemical treatment would both improve disinfection energy efficiency and user acceptability of the treated liquid. Here we describe the development and testing of a hybrid system that combines these technologies and demonstrate its ability to achieve full disinfection with improved energy efficiency and liquid quality more suitable for onsite reuse and/or discharge.

AB Microbial heterotrophic guilds in activated sludge wastewater treatment systems have complex population structures and functions. A previously proposed heterotrophic-specialist model states that heterotrophs consist of sub-guilds specialized in consuming specific classes of compounds, either readily degradable substrate (RDS) or slowly degradable substrate (SDS) according to current mathematical modeling practices for wastewater treatment processes. It follows from metabolic considerations that the levels of RNA and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) are correlated for strains of the same species growing in different environments; a conjecture previously tested. The proposed classification of heterotrophs into RDS or SDS consumers predicts that the same correlation would also be found across heterotrophic species in conventional activated sludge systems; this prediction was tested in the current study. The positive correlation between the RNA and PHA levels was observed in 9 conventional activated sludge plants in two independent sampling times and it was also found stable over a 6-month regular sampling period at one of these plants. Together, these results imply that the levels of RNA and PHA can be used to define heterotrophic-specialist sub-guilds. In order to gain insight in the species composition of the defined sub-guilds, flow cytometry cell sorting was used to further analyze one of the activated sludge samples. Four sorted sub-samples were obtained (high-RNA/high-PHA, low-RNA/high-PHA, high-RNA/low-PHA, and low-RNA/low-PHA), and the phylogenetic composition of each was determined using 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing. Heterotrophic genera were identified across 12 phyla, and their representation in each sorted sub-sample showed that the high-RNA/high-PHA and low-RNA/low-PHA groups were most dissimilar. The enriched genera in these sorted sub-samples are suggested to represent the composition of heterotrophic-specialized sub-guilds defined by the kinetics of substrate consumption.

AB The Photo-Fenton-like (PF-like) process with minute Fe(III) concentrations and the Hydrogen Peroxide Photolysis (HPP), using Xe-lamp or solar light as sources of irradiation, were efficiently applied to eliminate the herbicide 2,4-D from water.
   PF-like experiments concerning ferric and H2O2 concentrations of 0.6 mg L-1 and 20 mg L-1 respectively, using Xenon lamps (Xe-lamps) as a source of irradiation and 2,4-D concentrations of 10 mg L-1 at pH 3.6, exhibited complete 2,4-D degradation and 77% dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal after 30 min and 6 h of irradiation respectively whereas HPP (in absence of ferric ions) experiments showed a 2,4-D reduction and DOC removal of 90% and 7% respectively after 6 h of irradiation. At pH 7.0, HPP process achieved a 2,4-D abatement of approximately 75% and a DOC removal of 4% after 6 h. PF-like exhibited slightly improved 2,4-D and DOC removals (80% and 12% respectively) after the same irradiation time probably due to the low pH reduction (from 7.0 to 5.6). Several chlorinated-aromatic intermediates were identified by HPLC-MS. These by-products were efficiently removed by PF at pH 3.6, whereas at neutral PF-like and acid or neutral HPP, they were not efficiently degraded. With natural solar light irradiation, 10 and 1 mg L-1 of 2,4-D were abated using minor H2O2 concentrations (3, 6, 10 and 20 mg L-1) and iron at 0.6 mg L-1 in Milli-Q water. Similar results to Xe-lamp experiments were obtained, where solar UV-B + A light H2O2 photolysis (HPSP) and solar photo-Fenton-like (SPF-like) played an important role and even at low H2O2 and ferric concentrations of 3 and 0.6 mg L-1 respectively, 2,4-D was efficiently removed at pH 3.6. Simulated surface water at pH 3.6 containing 1 mg L-1 2,4-D, 20 mg L-1 H2O2 and 0.6 mg L-1 Fe(III) under natural sunlight irradiation efficiently removed the herbicide and its main metabolite 2,4-DCP after 30 min of treatment while at neutral pH, 40% of herbicide degradation was achieved. In the case of very low iron concentrations (0.05 mg L-1) at acid pH, 150 min of solar treatment was required to remove 2,4-D. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) performance metrics can vary widely with operating methods. Conventional CDI operating methods such as constant current and constant voltage show advantages in either energy or salt removal performance, but not both. We here develop a theory around and experimentally demonstrate a new operation for CDI that uses sinusoidal forcing voltage (or sinusoidal current). We use a dynamic system modeling approach, and quantify the frequency response (amplitude and phase) of CDI effluent concentration. Using a wide range of operating conditions, we demonstrate that CDI can be modeled as a linear time invariant system. We validate this model with experiments, and show that a sinusoid voltage operation can simultaneously achieve high salt removal and strong energy performance, thus very likely making it superior to other conventional operating methods. Based on the underlying coupled phenomena of electrical charge (and ionic) transfer with bulk advection in CDI, we derive and validate experimentally the concept of using sinusoidal voltage forcing functions to achieve resonance type operation for CDI. Despite the complexities of the system, we find a simple relation for the resonant time scale: the resonant time period (frequency) is proportional (inversely proportional) to the geometric mean of the flow residence time and the electrical (RC) charging time. Operation at resonance implies the optimal balance between absolute amount of salt removed (in moles) and dilution (depending on the feed volume processed), thus resulting in the maximum average concentration reduction for the desalinated water. We further develop our model to generalize the resonant time-scale operation, and provide responses for square and triangular voltage waveforms as two examples. To this end, we develop a general tool that uses Fourier analysis to construct CDI effluent dynamics for arbitrary input waveforms. Using this tool, we show that most of the salt removal (similar to 95%) for square and triangular voltage forcing waveforms is achieved by the fundamental Fourier (sinusoidal) mode. The frequency of higher Fourier modes precludes high flow efficiency for these modes, so these modes consume additional energy for minimal additional salt removed. This deficiency of higher frequency modes further highlights the advantage of DC-offset sinusoidal forcing for CDI operation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Toxic and odorous iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs) could form in the chemical oxidation of iodine-containing water. A critical step for controlling the hazardous I-DBPs is to convert the iodine species into stable and harmless iodate (IO3-) while inhibiting the accumulation of highly reactive hypoiodous acid (HOI). Herein, the oxidation of I- and HOI with ferrate was investigated, and the formation profile of HOI was determined based on 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) coloring method through a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The second-order rate constants (k(app)) of ferrate with HOI decreased from 1.6 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1) to 8.3 x 10(2) M(-1)s(-1) as the solution pH varied from 5.3 to 10.3, which were 7.5, 7.2 and 13.8 times higher than that of ferrate with I- at pH 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0, respectively. Compared with other oxidants such as ozone, hypochlorous acid, chloramine and potassium permanganate, ferrate would swiftly oxidize HOI formed in the I- oxidation process. For the ferrate oxidation of I-containing water, HOI was swiftly oxidized to IO3- from pH 5.0 to 9.0. Phosphate buffer promoted the oxidation of I- while inhibited the oxidation of HOI with ferrate. When 5 mgC/L of humic acids (HA) existed in the solution, no formation of iodoform and monoiodoacetic acid (MIAA) was observed in the oxidation of iodide (20 mu M) with ferrate (from 10 mu M to 80 mu M). These results suggested that ferrate oxidation could be an effective method for the control of I-DBPs in iodine-containing water treatment. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effective aridity in riparian areas is increasing from climate change and from human water consumption, which exacerbates the impacts of effluents from wastewater-treatment plants and from catchment run-off in rivers. The potential of natural riparian areas to act as 'green filters' has long been recognized, but the possible ecological benefits of natural riparian areas over large-scale environmental gradients on fish have not been explored in detail. Using an extensive data-set from northeastern Spain (99,700 km(2), 15 catchments, 530 sites), ours is the first study to ask whether natural riparian vegetation can mitigate the effects of pollution on fish in rivers experiencing water scarcity. We used multimodel inference to explore the additive and interactive effects of riparian vegetation with nutrient pollution and water conductivity, which are among the world's worst river stressors, on multiple fish guilds, including widely distributed species and highly invasive alien fish species. Most models (54%) supported the additive effects of water-quality factors on fish, after having accounted for the influence of geography and hydrological alterations. Although many fewer models (7%) included riparian vegetation as an important predictor, riparian vegetation modulated the forms of the associations between fish and pollution. The relationship of nutrient pollution with native and alien fish richness changed from negative to positive with greater riparian structure or species richness. However, we found the opposite effect for the mean body size of sedentary fish, and only positive additive effects of riparian richness for the probability of occurrence of pelagic fish. Ammonium and nitrite concentrations adversely affected fish in these rivers up to 10 years after the enforcement of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive by the European Union. High conductivity also much affects fish, having negatives associations with migratory, pelagic, invertivorous and native fish, and positive associations with sedentary, benthic, omnivorous and alien fish. Therefore, the current status of natural riparian areas is unlikely to fully mitigate water-quality impacts on fish. The conservation of freshwater resources in semi-arid regions, such as north-eastern Spain, requires improved waste-water treatments and better agriculture practices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID MEMBRANE; MODULE; PERFORMANCE
AB The consumption of saline groundwater has contributed to a growing incidence of renal diseases, particularly in coastal communities of India. Although reverse osmosis (RO) is routinely used to remove salt from groundwater, conventional RO systems (i.e. centralized systems using spiral wound RO elements) have limited utility in these communities due to high capital and maintenances costs, and lack of infrastructure to distribute the water. Consequently, there is a need to develop an appropriate solution for groundwater treatment based on small-scale, mobile and community-led systems.
   In this work, we designed a mobile desalination system to provide a simple platform for water treatment and delivery of goods to rural communities. The system employs tubular RO membranes packed in a single, low-profile vessel which fits below the cargo space. The low-profile enables minimal intrusion on the space available for the transportation of goods. Pressure is delivered by a belt driven clutch pump, powered by the engine. Water is treated locally by connecting the intake to the village well while the vehicle idles.
   A combined numerical and experimental approach was used to optimise the module/system design, resulting in similar to 20% permeate flux enhancement. Experimental results revealed that the system can produce 16 L per square meter of membrane area per hour (LMH) at a salinity level of 80 ppm from a similar to 2000 ppm groundwater when it is feed at 1 m(3)/h at 8 bars. This indicates that a vehicle equipped with 12 m(2) of tubular RO membranes can deliver 1 m(3) of drinkable water by using similar to 0.9 L of diesel. Assuming eight such systems could be implemented in a community to fulfil the water demands for a village with 2000 residents, a social business study revealed that a payback time of 2.5 years is achievable, even if the sale price of the water is relatively low, USD 0.18 (Rs 12, which is half of the lowest market price) per 20 L, including providing a goods transportation service at price of USD 5.25 (Rs 350) per 100 km.

AB The rapid rise of shale gas development has triggered environmental and human health concerns due to its impacts on water resources, especially on disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation upon chlorination. Despite the recently reported results on bromide, the effects of non-bromide ions in production wastewater at extremely high levels are vaguely defined. In this study, we investigated the effects of production wastewater, with bromide and non-bromide species, on the formation of DBPs when production wastewater was spiked into surface waters at various percentages. Results showed that the introduction of debrominated production wastewater led to increased formation of some chlorinated DBP species in selected surface water and wastewater. As the spiking percentage of debrominated production wastewater increased, the chlorinated DBP species increased. The contributions of individual cations to DBP formation followed a sequence of magnesium > calcium > barium at 0.10% spiking percentage due to the different catalytic effects of their chelates with organic precursors. The study of anions suggested that the discharge of treated production wastewater containing elevated sulfate may further enhance DBP formation. The significance of this study lies in the fact that in addition to bromide concerns from production wastewater, non-bromide species also contributed to DBP formation. The gas production wastewater management decision should consider the negative impacts from both bromide and non-bromide species to better protect the receiving water resources.

AB Concentrated wastewaters from agricultural industries represent a key opportunity for the upcycling of organics, nitrogen and phosphorus to higher value products such as microbial protein. Phototrophic or photosynthetic microbes very effectively capture input organics and nutrients as microbial protein. This study compares purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB) and microalgae (photosynthesis) for this purpose, treating real, high strength poultry processing wastewater in continuous photo bioreactors utilising infrared (IR) and white light (WL) respectively. Both reactors could effectively treat the wastewaters, and at similar loading rates (4 kgCOD m(-3)d(-1)). The infrared reactor (IRR) was irradiated at 18 W m(-2) and the white light reactor (WLR) reactor at 1.5-2 times this. The IRR could remove up to 90% total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), 90% total nitrogen (TN) and 45% total phosphorus (TP) at 1.0d hydraulic retention time (HRT) and recover around 190 kg of crude protein per tonne of influent COD at 7.0 kWh per dry tonne(-1) light input, with PPB dominating all samples. In comparison, the WLR removed up to 98% COD, 94% TN and 44% TP at 43-90% higher irradiance compared to the PPB reactor. Microalgae did not dominate the WLR and the community was instead a mix of microbes (algae, bacteria, zooplankton and detritus - ALBAZOD) with a production of approximately 140 kg crude protein per tonne influent (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Electron-donating activated aromatic moieties, including phenols, in dissolved organic matter (DOM) partially control its reactivity with the chemical oxidants ozone and chlorine. This comparative study introduces two sensitive analytical systems to directly and selectively quantify the electron-donating capacity (EDC) of DOM, which corresponds to the number of electrons transferred from activated aromatic moieties, including phenols, to the added chemical oxidant 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) radical cation (i.e., ABTS(center dot+)). The first system separates DOM by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) followed by a post-column reaction with ABTS(center dot+) and a spectrophotometric quantification of the reduction of ABTS(center dot+) by DOM. The second system employs flow-injection analysis (FIA) coupled to electrochemical detection to quantify ABTS(center dot+) reduction by DOM. Both systems have very low limits of quantification, allowing determination of EDC values of dilute DOM samples with <1 mg carbon per liter. When applied to ozonated and chlorinated model DOM isolates and real water samples, the two analytical systems showed that EDC values of the treated DOM decrease with increasing specific oxidant doses. The EDC decreases detected by the two systems were in overall good agreement except for one sample containing DOM with a very low EDC. The combination of EDC with UV-absorbance measurements gives further insights into the chemical reaction pathways of DOM with chemical oxidants such as ozone or chlorine. We propose the use of EDC in water treatment facilities as a readily measurable parameter to determine the content of electron-donating aromatic moieties in DOM and thereby its reactivity with added chemical oxidants.

AB To develop reactive and antifouling membrane filtration systems, a photo-Fenton ceramic membrane was prepared by coating goethite (alpha-FeOOH) catalysts on a zirconia/titania alumina membrane via a cross-linking method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterize alpha-FeOOH catalysts and the surface coating quality. The cross linker yielded stable covalent binding between catalyst and membrane under room temperature and produced a homogeneous and smooth coating of catalyst on ceramic membranes. Photo-Fenton reactions were initiated with addition of H2O2 under UV irradiation to improve the foulant degradation on membrane surface while filtration. Membrane fouling was simulated by bovine serum albumin (BSA) and humic acid (HA). Our results show that the photo-Fenton reactions on the coated membranes slowed down the fouling kinetics and even reversed the fouling, leading to a stable transmembrane pressure (TMP) over time of filtration, as opposed to a monotonous increase of TMP due to surface fouling. The batch experiments verified that the photo-Fenton reactions achieved the degradation rates of 76% and 86% for HA and BSA respectively within 60 min, with the mineralization rates of over 80% as indicated by the total organic carbon measurement. This study embarks on a novel antifouling membrane filtration process via incorporation of photo-Fenton reactions. The findings are also important for diverse applications of surface fouling mitigation and rationale design of fouling resistant surfaces or materials through photo-Fenton or other catalytic reactions.

AB Versatile electrochemical reactions are effective for removing a wide range of water contaminants. This study focuses on the development and testing of bifunctional electrocatalytic filter anodes as reactive and separating media for the simultaneous removal of refractory dissolved organic and particulate contaminants from real wastewater effluents. The results show that the TiO2 particle interlayers formed between the Ti fiber support and the top composite metal oxide catalyst layers assist in reducing filter pores to an effective size range that enables removal of most particulates within the wastewater. The double-sheet design, which is a sandwich-structured module with an internal void space for permeate, prevents filter fouling, and transmembrane pressure can be maintained at a very low level of <5 kPa during batch and continuous flow reactor operations. Substantive and simultaneous removal of dissolved organics (e.g., chromophores, fluorophores, 1,4-dioxane, chemical oxygen demand, and total organic carbon) and particulate matter (i.e., turbidity) are achieved, although removal rates and efficacies differ depending on the electric current density applied. Decolorization and particulate rejection occur swiftly and immediately, but 1,4-dioxane degradation is relatively slow and quite time-dependent. Possible 1,4-dioxane degradation pathways during electrocatalysis are also proposed. Electrochemical filtration technology shows considerable promise for use in the next generation of advanced wastewater treatment solutions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has been widely studied as part of efforts to improve understanding of the aquatic carbon cycle, by laboratory, in situ, and remote sensing methods. We studied ecoregion-scale differences in CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to understand variability in organic matter composition and the use of CDOM as a proxy for DOC. Data from 299 lakes across the U.S. Upper Midwest showed that CDOM, measured as absorptivity at 440 nm (n44o), correlated strongly with DOC (R-2 = 0.81, n = 412). Colored lakes in the Northern Lakes and Forests (NLF) ecoregion drove this relationship. Lakes in the North Central Hardwood Forests (NCHF) had low color (most had a(440) <3 m(-1)) and weaker CDOM-DOC relationships (R-2 = 0.47). Spectral slopes and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), indicated relatively low aromaticity and non-terrestrial DOM sources in low color lakes. Multiple regression analyses that included total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and CDOM, but not chlorophyll a, improved DOC estimates in low color lakes, suggesting a dominant contribution of non-planktonic sources of low color DOM in these lakes. Our results show that CDOM is a reliable, regional proxy for DOC in lakes where forests and wetlands dominate the landscape and the DOM is primarily terrestrial in origin. Mapping of lake DOC at broad spatial scales by satellite-derived CDOM has lower accuracy in low color lakes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The treatment of distilled water with varying amounts of dissolved sodium bicarbonate (representing alkalinity) is considered using an atmospheric pressure electrical discharge. The discharge ignited between a capillary tube (used as powered electrode) and a ground electrode wrapped around the beaker holding the treated water consists of streamers propagating in ambient air and striking the water surface. The streamer interaction with water is shown to lead to a decrease in pH and an increase in nitrate concentration. The pH variation with time is shown to be similar to a titration curve for acid-base neutralization with final pH values around 3 for 22 min of treatment. The nitrate ion concentration increase with time is consistent with a two-rate system-level model that is characterized by two asymptotic rates for NO3- creation by the plasma. The two asymptotic rates are calibrated to be about 2.7 mu mol/min and 22.5 mu mol/min with the transition between the two rates occurring at the breakeven time that is representative of the time required for all dissolved bicarbonate to be consumed by the plasma treatment. The increase in rate of NO3- creation at the breakeven time is attributed to the increase in conductivity of the treated solution once all bicarbonate is consumed thereby modifying the plasma properties. Another system-level model that is based on the observed pH variation is also considered for comparison with measured data. While both system-level models have some discrepancies with the measurements, the two-rate model based on the nitrate ion concentration is concluded to be more useful for determining the NO3- formation rates in the context of irrigation water enrichment. The discrepancies are attributed to the simplicity of the system-level models considered here where the effect of the plasma is completely represented by the creation of just one chemical species in HNO3 thereby neglecting potentially important species such as HNO2 and H2O2. Nevertheless, the proposed system level model could greatly assist in the design of plasma treatment systems with specified alkalinity, pH and nitrate ion levels for irrigation water.

AB A 34-year-old right-handed female presented to the emergency department with a worsening headache, neck stiffness, intermittent abnormal sensation, and right arm weakness. Shortly after arrival, she had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. A noncontrast head computed tomography scan revealed a right-sided, low-attenuating, lobulated mass ipsilateral to her arm symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an abnormal signal throughout the subarachnoid space and increased fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence signal contralateral to the mass. This presentation suggested a false localization sign of sensory and motor disturbance ipsilateral to the mass likely caused by cyst rupture and sebum spread contralateral, causing cortical irritation (evidenced by increased fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence signal). During mass resection, sebum was visible throughout the subarachnoid space. The patient had an uneventful recovery from surgery and has been seizure free since the resection with steady improvement of symptoms. This case highlights the importance of avoiding cyst rupture of dermoid cysts.

AB BACKGROUND: It is not clear whether cognitive adverse events can occur after subthalamic nuclei deep brain stimulation in Parkinson disease, and the putative mechanisms are poorly understood.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report on a rare case of a 68-year-old woman with Parkinson disease but no previous cognitive impairment. The day after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nuclei, the woman presented with new-onset dementia and acute, severe, persistent, global cognitive decline, prompting a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients seen in routine clinical practice, the simultaneous presence of several neurodegenerative diseases might not be uncommon. The assessment of mild cognitive impairment with a standardized method is highly recommended, a systematic 3-dimensional volumetric analysis of hippocampal structures should be part of the pre-deep brain stimulation evaluation, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers should be screened for if at least 1 of the 2 previously mentioned aspects is abnormal.

LA English
DT Article
DE Cavernous sinus; Cerebral bypass; Free flap; Radical resection
ID BYPASS-SURGERY; INTRACRANIAL BYPASS; SKULL BASE; MENINGIOMAS; ANEURYSMS
AB BACKGROUND: Complete cavernous sinus resection has been described for patients with malignant or recurrent cavernous sinus tumors without other therapeutic options but has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We reviewed the complications associated with complete cavernous sinus resection to gain insights for future complication avoidance.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospective, single-institution database was performed to identify patients who had undergone complete cavernous sinus resection from July 2014 to October 2017. Patient- and disease-specific data, surgical complications, and clinical outcomes were recorded.
   RESULTS: Two male patients underwent complete cavernous sinus resection (aged 60 and 47 years) for recurrent maxillary tumors with secondary cavernous sinus extension. Revascularization was performed based on balloon test occlusion (BTO) results, with extracranial-to-intracranial bypass performed in 1 patient with a concerning hemispheric flow pattern found during BTO. Vascularized free flaps were used in both patients to assist with closure of the resulting skull base defect. Three complications related to surgery occurred in 1 patient (thigh hematoma, recurrent cerebrospinal fluid leak, and meningitis). One patient died of pneumonia approximately 2 weeks postoperatively, and the other experienced an acceptable neurologic and oncologic outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high peri- and postoperative risks, complete cavernous sinus resection can be considered for select patients with tumors involving the cavernous sinus without other treatment options. Familiarity with cerebral bypass and free flap reconstruction of skull base defects is critical for complication avoidance and management.

AB BACKGROUND: Facet dislocations, or jumped facets, are part of a spectrum of flexion-distraction spine injuries. Bilateral and unilateral facet dislocations are commonly seen in the cervical spine. Traumatic jumped facets in the lumbar spine are rare injuries, and most involve the lumbosacral junction. Lumbar facet subluxations occur commonly in young patients owing to flexion-distraction forces on the lumbar spine at the time of injury combined with ligamentous laxity that exists in young patients.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 24-year-old man presented with a unilateral right facet dislocation at L3-4 with anterolisthesis and canal stenosis after a motor vehicle accident.
   CONCLUSIONS: Following anatomic reduction, unilateral jumped facets can be effectively treated with instrumented stabilization. This report provides evidence for the durability of short segment arthrodesis in select cases of a rare lumbar facet subluxation.

AB BACKGROUND: Acute subdural hematomas are frequently seen in brain trauma-injured patients. However, spontaneous subdural hematomas are uncommon, especially those localized in the posterior fossa, where fewer than 10 case reports have been described in the medical literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a patient who suddenly had a headache and progressed rapidly to coma and signs of brainstem compression. She was diagnosed with posterior fossa subdural hematoma after image examinations that were endorsed by surgical findings. A posterior fossa craniectomy was performed and was associated with blood drainage.
   CONCLUSIONS: The patient had a great outcome, with no neurologic deficits at hospital discharge and the 1-year follow-up.

TI Transforaminal Endoscopic Excision of Intradural Lumbar Disk Herniation
   and Dural Repair
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endoscopic dural repair technique; Endoscopic spine surgery; Intradural
   disk herniation
ID RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Intradural disk herniation is a rare entity with <0.3%-1% of all disk herniations and at an L2-L3 level even rarer. The dural defects repairs on ventral aspect are technically challenging and may not be possible after durotomy, so many authors have placed fascia, muscle, or plugging by the hemostatic material. The surgical treatment of intradural disk herniation is usually posterior open surgery with formal durotomy to remove the disk fragments with good to fair results. Poorer outcome occurs in late-presenting cases.
   CASE REPORT: We report on a 78-year-old man who presented with spontaneous low back pain and bilateral buttock pain aggravated for 1 month with severe walking difficulty without bowel and bladder symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed disk herniation at the L2-L3 level. He underwent a transforaminal endoscopic removal of intradural disk fragments via the original rent in the anterolateral aspect of the dura, and sealing was performed with dural patch and Gelfoam without any lumbar drain. The patient's symptom significantly improved postoperatively with muscle power improved to grade 5 on day 1 with no cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and he was mobilized with a lumbar orthosis on the first postoperative day. Postoperative and at 6-month follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging revealed adequate decompression and successful sealing of the ventral dural defect.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of transforaminal endoscopic treatment of intradural disk herniation at an L2-L3 level in which good clinical outcomes were obtained and maintained until recent follow-up of 8 months.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior pituitary tumor is rare, and its optimal surgical strategy is undetermined. Surgical removal of posterior pituitary tumors is often complicated by their hypervascularity. Prevention and preparation for excessive hemorrhage is crucial for safe resection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman presented with bitemporal hemianopsia and was found to have a sellar tumor with suprasellar extension, resembling a pituitary adenoma. Microscopic transsphenoidal resection was attempted but was interrupted by a massive intraoperative hemorrhage. Pathologic diagnosis was a spindle cell oncocytoma, and she was referred to our institution. She underwent preoperative embolization to decrease tumor vascularity, and resection was performed using a combined endoscopic endonasal and video-microscopic transcranial approach, using a 4K three-dimensional (3D) video microscope. The final diagnosis was a posterior pituitary tumor with immunopositivity for thyroid transcription factor-1, with preferred interpretation as a pituicytoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: A combined endonasal and transcranial approach with preoperative embolization is a useful strategy for hypervascular posterior pituitary tumors. A 4K 3D video microscope is compact, and it provides high-resolution images, contributing larger surgical space and facilitating a multi-team surgery.

DT Editorial Material
DE Eyelid; Eyelid approach; Fronto-orbital craniotomy; Orbital osteotomy;
   Transblepharo-preseptal modified orbitozygomatic approach;
   Transpalpebral approach
AB Various supraorbital approaches to the anterior cranial fossa using a transciliary or supraciliary incision have been described. An orbitotomy is a valuable addition to the standard supraorbital keyhole approach offering an extended angle of exposure with minimal frontal lobe retraction. The transpalpebral approach is common in oculoplastic surgery and offers excellent cosmetic outcomes using the natural crease of the superior eyelid. This approach avoids risk of eyebrow alopecia and damage to the frontalis muscle or frontalis branches of the facial nerve. A transblepharo-preseptal or transpalpebral modified orbitozygomatic approach for the treatment of unruptured anterior circulation aneurysms has been reported. Our experience with this approach has been that it has potential to offer anterior skull base access and outcomes that are not inferior to traditional approaches for selected cases including ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms. Moreover, we believe this approach can provide excellent cosmetic results and could minimize surgical time and hospitalization stay.
   This 3-dimensional video presents the case of a 47-year-old female with sudden-onset headache and seizure (Video 1). She was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from rupture of a carotid terminus aneurysm. Considering the location and morphology of the aneurysm, as well as the patient's eyelid anatomy, clip ligation via a transblepharo-preseptal modified orbitozygomatic craniotomy was recommended. Aneurysm clipping was uneventful, and postoperative imaging showed complete occlusion. The patient was discharged neurologically intact.

ID MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; C-11-METHIONINE; TUMOR; DISEASE; GLIOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Tumefactive demyelinating lesion (TDL) is often reported as a rare variation of multiple sclerosis (MS). TDL is difficult to diagnose solely by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with no history of MS. This is because the lesion often shows ring enhancement with perifocal brain edema on gadolinium MRI, thus mimicking glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old healthy woman complained of headache 1 month before admission. She developed a decline in cognitive function, decreased attention, and executive function disorder 10 days before admission. Gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging showed a ring-shaped enhancement accompanied by massive brain edema in the left frontal lobe. This suggested GBM, but methionine positron emission tomography (MET PET), surprisingly, showed no uptake with a tumor-to-normal brain ratio of 1.18. Accordingly, we eliminated GBM and suspected brain abscess because diffusion-weighted images showed high signal intensity in the lesion. Although we performed drainage, we could not demonstrate the presence of pus. Pathologic analysis of a specimen obtained by needle biopsy revealed broad necrosis and a small number of inflammatory cells. We therefore prescribed steroid therapy, by which symptoms gradually improved. No relapse occurred for 2 years. We finally diagnosed the patient as having TDL.
   CONCLUSIONS: MET PET is considered a possible diagnostic modality for demyelinating disease as it can appropriately reflect pathologic findings. MET PET will facilitate decision making regarding surgery in patients with TDL.

AB INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Hydrocephalus is a common neurosurgical disorder that can lead to significant disability or death if not promptly identified and treated. Data on the burden of hydrocephalus in low-income countries are limited, given a lack of radiologic resources for the diagnosis of this condition. Here, we present an analysis of patterns of hydrocephalus from a large sample of computed tomography (CT) scans of the head performed at a public hospital in rural Haiti, a low-income country in the Caribbean.
   METHODS: We analyzed reports from 3614 CT scans of the head performed between July 2013 and January 2016 for findings that were consistent with a diagnosis of hydrocephalus (report indicating "hydrocephalus," "ventriculomegaly," or " enlargement of the ventricles"). Extracted data included demographics, study indication, radiologic findings, and reported etiology of hydrocephalus.
   RESULTS: In total, 119 scans had findings concerning for hydrocephalus (3.5% of all scans, 6.3% of abnormal scans; age range 0-90 years; median age 35.5 years; 49.6% male). Pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) accounted for 39% of cases. In total, 113 of 119 (95%) scans had indications for possible neurosurgical intervention. Among these 113 scans, 36 (30%) scans demonstrated communicating hydrocephalus, 66 (55%) scans demonstrated noncommunicating hydrocephalus (primarily due to intraventricular hemorrhage [27 scans, 23%] or brain tumors [24, 20%]), and 11 (9%) scans were indeterminate regarding whether the hydrocephalus was communicating versus noncommunicating.
   CONCLUSIONS: In a large sample of CTs performed in a rural low-income setting, hydrocephalus was common, predominantly noncommunicating, and often associated with potentially operable intracranial lesions. Data of this nature can inform research, policy, and clinical collaborations that strengthen the neurosurgical capacity of lowincome countries.

TI Management of Concomitant Moyamoya Disease, Arterial Venous
   Malformation, and Intracranial Aneurysm: Case Illustration, Literature
   Review, and Management Algorithm
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Arterial venous malformation; Cerebral aneurysm; EC-IC bypass;
   Endovascular coiling; Moyamoya disease; Stereotactic radiosurgery
AB BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease (MMD), arterial venous malformations (AVMs), and intracranial aneurysms are distinct cerebrovascular disease processes that most commonly occur in isolation. The literature on the treatment algorithm of each individual condition is well established. An association between MMD and intracranial aneurysms is also known, but MMD in association with AVM is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: The authors discuss various dilemmas in the multi-modality management of these conditions when they coexist with an illustrative case of a 46-year-old woman who presented following a stroke, with 1) left-sided MMD, 2) left-sided frontal AVM, and 3) an aneurysm arising from the A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery. These were managed respectively by 1) the left external carotid artery to M2 segment of middle cerebral artery bypass using an autologous radial artery graft and left indirect superior temporal artery-encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, 2) stereotactic radiosurgery, and 3) endovascular coiling of the aneurysm. Three years following intervention, cerebral angiography showed a patent bypass, complete obliteration of the AVM, and no residual filling of the coiled aneurysm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our strategy of surgical revascularization for MMD, radiosurgery for AVM, and endovascular coiling for aneurysm resulted in a positive long-term clinical outcome. In view of the rarity of the condition, the authors propose a management algorithm for such patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Complications arising from cerebral venous occlusion/sacrifice during neurosurgical procedures have received comparatively less attention in the neurosurgical literature. Consequently, cerebral venous complications are not given due recognition, even though most practicing neurosurgeons would agree that they are not uncommon. We present a review of complications arising from venous sacrifice/occlusion during neurosurgery and discuss strategies described in the literature to prevent such occurrences.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to provide a synopsis of the current evidence regarding cerebral venous injury after a neurosurgical procedure. The objectives of this review were to assess the incidence of venous injuries after a neurosurgical procedure with their clinical outcome and to evaluate current strategies and technical advances for their prevention. Complications related to dural venous sinuses were not considered in this review.
   RESULTS: Twenty-six relevant articles were identified and reviewed. Complications from cerebral venous occlusion/sacrifice are being increasingly recognized, and venous preservation strategies are being promoted in the neurosurgical literature. Based on our review of literature, the incidence of venous injury can range from 2.6% to 30%. We discuss the pathophysiology after venous injury and factors affecting outcome after cerebral venous injury. An overview of surgical techniques described to prevent or manage venous injury during neurosurgical procedures is presented.
   CONCLUSIONS: The unpredictable response of the brain to venous injury causes catastrophic complications in a few patients. To avoid these complications, meticulous venous preservation should be a goal in all neurosurgical procedures. Increased recognition of cerebral venous complications over the last 2 decades has resulted in the increasing recognition among neurosurgeons that venous preservation is an essential tenet of neurosurgery.

TI Hydrogen Peroxide Head Preparation: Enabling Cuttings and Anatomic
   Studies of Skull Base Dura Mater and Arachnoid Without Use of Drilling
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Head embalming; Histology; Hydrogen peroxide; Neuroanatomy; Skull base
ID MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY; FORAMEN MAGNUM; AGENTS
AB INTRODUCTION: Anatomic pieces that are preserved using formaldehyde allow us to undertake high-quality skull base studies. However, extensive drilling is often necessary, which can lead to damages to the dura mater and thus arachnoid. Formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide can soften the bone, which, in turn, can be easily cut with a scalpel or removed with a curette. After having discovered this technique by chance, our aim was to establish a study protocol of the skull base dura mater without the use of the drill.
   METHODS: Ten heads were set with a 10% formalin solution and then injected with colored latex. Five heads were then subsequently bleached with 20% hydrogen peroxide solution (HPS). The following were studied weekly: 1) macroscopic modification of the bone, dura mater, arachnoid and brain; 2) histology; 3) computed tomography scans; and 4) calcium concentration screenings were studied weekly.
   RESULTS: After several weeks (mean 6.1, range 5-8 weeks), all HPS specimens were flexible, similar to rubber in consistence. Geometrical bone cuts could be made while preserving all the surrounding anatomic structure (cranial nerves, dura mater, and vascular elements). Histologically, the dural and bone structure are preserved. The HPS cadavers appear to be radiologically demineralized. We note a significant calcium concentration augmentation in HPS solution after 1 month, 6 weeks, and 2 months compared with day 0.
   CONCLUSIONS: The softening of the bone, probably caused by decalcification from the use of corrosive chemicals present in hydrogen peroxide solution, can ease the cutting of the skull base geometrically, which is useful for anatomic and workshop studies.

ID MANAGEMENT; OCCLUSION; STENOSIS
AB Bow hunter's syndrome is a rare clinical condition. It is caused by dynamic compression of the vertebral artery (VA) either at the level of the transverse foramina (V2 segment) or at the atlantoaxial level (V3 segment). We report a 54-year-old man with typical bow hunter's syndrome caused by compression at the level of C6/C7. He was successfully treated by anterolateral VA decompression without a need for stabilization. We present preoperative imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomographic angiography, and dynamic angiography) and a high-quality intraoperative video detailing each step of the surgical technique (high-definition video with annotations and audio track of the Doppler ultrasound used as intraoperative control). Furthermore, postoperative imaging and a video of the clinical outcome are presented. Adequate management of bow hunter's syndrome requires good pathophysiologic understanding of the disease and careful clinical examination. Dynamic angiography confirms the exact site of VA compression. Surgical decompression is the treatment of the cause. Surgical techniques include VA decompression by an anterolateral approach (V2 or V3) or a posterior approach (V3). Some authors advocate standalone stabilization, which is, however, only an indirect treatment and results in significant loss of head motion. Other nonsurgical treatments such as orthesis, medical therapy, or endovascular stenting have been only anecdotally reported. Bow hunter's syndrome is best treated by VA decompression. This may safely be achieved by good anatomic knowledge and a straightforward surgical technique. Here, the anterolateral approach is presented in detail in a high-definition surgical instruction video.

AB OBJECTIVE: The incidental dural tear is a common complication in lumbar spine surgery. It has been reported that the incidence of dural tears is much greater in endoscopic procedures. Primary closure via suturing remains challenging in endoscopic procedures. The objective of this study was to conduct a literature reviewon the surgical technique for dural closure and repair in endoscopic spine surgery.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using the database PubMed. In total, 12 studies reported specifically about the surgical treatment for dural tear in percutaneous and tubular assisted endoscopic technique. The dural tear rate, the technique of dural closure, postoperative time of bed rest, postoperative symptoms related to cerebrospinal fluid fistula, and revision surgery were assessed.
   RESULTS: The overall rate of dural tears in endoscopic spinal surgery was 2.7%, with a range from 0% to 8.6%. The incidence of a dural tear was much greater in cases with lumbar stenosis (3.7%) than in lumbar disc herniation (2.1%). The greatest rate was accompanied by resecting synovial cysts. In addition, the risk of dural tear is greater in bilateral decompression procedures via a unilateral approach. There is no consensus about the ideal technique for dural closure in endoscopic procedures. Furthermore, there is a debate whether dural tear requires surgical treatment or not.
   CONCLUSIONS: An autologous muscle or fat graft in combination with fibrin glue or a fibrin-sealed collagen sponge seems to be a good and safe method for the management of dural tear in lumbar endoscopic spine surgery.

ID INTERVERTEBRAL-DISK CALCIFICATION; SURGICAL TECHNIQUE; EXCISION; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Partially calcified lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) can cause severe radiating pain and neurologic symptoms requiring surgical treatment. As it is not safe to enforce conventional endoscopic lumbar discectomy using trephine or burr to remove the partially calcified disc, we report a calcification floating technique using a working channel for the treatment of these cases.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 31 patients who underwent full endoscopic discectomy using this technique for partially calcified lumbar HNP between April 2009 and June 2013. Calcification floating technique was performed by inserting the working channel around the partially calcified HNP and then rotating the working channel around it to remove the lesion. We analyzed the outcomes with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and complication rate.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 26.58 +/- 11.2 months. The inter-laminar approach was used in 15 cases, and the transforaminal approach was used in 16 cases. The mean VAS of 8.19 +/- 0.65 before surgery was decreased to 1.29 +/- 0.69 at the last follow-up. The mean ODI score before surgery was decreased at the last follow-up, from 41.32 +/- 2.87 to 9.87 +/- 3.47. Mean operative duration was 45 +/- 12 minutes per level. None of the patients required revision surgery or developed any major complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: Calcification floating technique is a safe and effective method for the treatment of partially calcified lumbar HNP.

AB BACKGROUND: In cases of Kummell disease without neurologic deficit, petrcutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty has achieved short-term favorable outcomes. In the long term, recollapse of the augmented vertebral body and aggravation of kyphosis at the index level is often reported. Owing to medical comorbidities, elderly patients are often unsuited for extensive open spine surgery under general anesthesia.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 95-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of intractable back pain and gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed intravertebral avascular necrosis with fluid collection at the L4 vertebra. After postural reduction using a pillow in the supine position for 2 days, percutaneous pedicle screw fixation with bone cement augmentation was performed at the 13-5 level including L4 fracture under epidural anesthesia. Additional posterior column compression was performed to achieve restoration of spinal canal and lumbar lordosis. Severe back pain was reduced after surgery, and the patient was able to walk the day after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of Rummell disease in an dxtremely elderly patient in whom good clinical result was obtained after postural reduction, vertebral augmentation, and short segment percutaneous pedicle screw fixation under epidural anesthesia.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hematologic inflammatory markers are simple, inexpensive prognostic markers for various conditions. The prognostic significance of the neutrophilto-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been shown in a variety of tumors. We evaluated the prognostic value of these markers in glioma.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review of 219 patients with glioma from January 2012 to January 2017, evaluating the effect of NLR, PLR, MLR, and RDW on prognosis. Correlations among these hematologic inflammatory markers were also examined.
   RESULTS: The patients were divided into high and low groups using the cutoff points from the receiver operating characteristic curves. High NLR was associated with a higher tumor grade (P = 0.000). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that the high NLR, PLR, and MLR groups experienced inferior median overall survival (OS) compared with the low NLR, PLR, and MLR groups (11 vs. 32 months; P = 0.000; 12 vs. 21 months; P = 0.001; and 12 vs. 22 months; P = 0.006, respectively). No significant difference was found in the median OS between the high and low RDW groups (15 vs. 23 months; P = 0.184). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that NLR was an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio, 1.758; P = 0.008).
   CONCLUSIONS: A high preoperative NLR, PLR, and MLR was predictive of a poor prognosis for patients with glioma. NLR was an independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with glioma.

AB BACKGROUND: Awake surgery is an effective technique to improve safety in surgical resection of lesions involving eloquent areas of the brain. lntraoperative imaging guidance and neuronavigation are widely applied in neurosurgical procedures. However, data on the application of intraoperative imaging to awake craniotomies are limited. We report our experience with intraoperative computed tomography (i-CT) during awake surgery, focusing on technical feasibility and effectiveness.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: Four patients with a lesion located in an eloquent area of the brain-1 with a cavernous hemangioma, 1 with a high-grade glioma, and 2 with a lowgrade glioma (LGG)-underwent awake surgery with neuronavigation guidance. In all patients, i-CT was used to evaluate the completeness of resection or the extent of residual tumor. lntraoperative ultrasound was also used during microsurgery to verify the presence of residual tumor. The use of i-CT us allowed to obtain updated images for neuronavigation and to correct for brain shift.
   CONCLUSIONS: i-CT in awake surgery is reliable and effective. It does not significantly affect the duration of surgery and does not add stress for the patient. The possibility to correct for brain shift also in awake patients can increase the precision and accuracy of surgery, particularly in cases of LGG, avoiding the resection of normal white matter or tumor remnants in noneloquent areas.

AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting is the most commonly performed procedure in the treatment of hydrocephalus. VP shunt migration can occur at different sites. The aim of the study was to present different sites of abnormal distal shunt location, pathophysiology, and the management in each situation.
   METHODS: Between 2014 and 2017, all patients with hydrocephalus in the Department of Neurosurgery, Cairo University, were gathered prospectively. All pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with shunt migration of the distal end of the VP shunt were identified.
   RESULTS: Of 1092 patients operated on by the VP shunt between 2014 and 2017, 15 presented with shunt dysfunction because of distal shunt migration (6 anal, 3 scrotal, 1 colon, 1 peroral, 1 upper lumbar extrusion, 1 paraspinal, 1 penile, and 1 umbilical). Especially upper lumbar extrusion and paraspinal shunt location are extremely rare. All the 15 patients were treated successfully with VP shunts and prospectively followed until they presented with complications on different occasions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Peritoneal complications are among the most common causes of VP failure. We present a rare complication where the shunt migrates outside the peritoneal cavity elsewhere with ambiguous pathogenesis. Special considerations have to be appointed during the shunt revision surgeries of these cases.

ID ARMREST
AB BACKGROUND: Based on our previous reports, stabilizing the surgeon's arm with an intraoperative armrest is linked to improved precision of microsurgical and endoscopic procedures. We developed the robotic intelligent surgeon's arm supporting system iArmS, which automatically follows the surgeon's arm and fixes it at an adequate position.
   METHODS: iArmS has 3 states-free, hold, and wait- which can be carefully chosen automatically as follows: In free state, the armholder follows the surgeon's arm. In hold state, iArmS supports the surgeon's arm weight by fixing the armholder. In wait state, the surgeon can move his or her arm away from the armholder. Also, the surgeon can change the armrest position while looking through the microscope and can continue the microsurgical procedure while holding surgical instruments. From February 2015 to January 2017, iArmS was used in 108 microsurgeries at 3 of the authors' institutions by 14 board-certified neurosurgeons, including the authors. After using iArmS, to quantify neurosurgeons' satisfaction, a scaling evaluation guide based on visual analog scales was designed to be completed by contributing neurosurgeons, including authors.
   RESULTS: iArmS decreased fatigue and reduced hand trembles experienced by surgeons. Continuous accurate motions of microinstruments were performed without any difficulties. There were no complications related to use of iArmS.
   CONCLUSIONS: iArmS allows continuous precise manipulations that provide high-quality surgical results in neurosurgical techniques. Moreover, iArmS is a useful automatic tool for holding and following the surgeon's arm.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the risk factors affecting intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) changes, when such changes take place, and clinical outcomes associated with IONM change during cervical open door laminoplasty (COL) for cervical compressive myelopathy.
   METHODS: Between 2010 and 2015, 79 patients who underwent COL with IONM recording were studied. Changes in motor evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials over an alarm criterion were defined as IONM change. Patients with IONM change were assigned to the alarm group, and the others were classified as the control group. Baseline data and radiographic measurements were compared between the 2 groups. Radiologic parameters including maximal compression level (MCL), area and diameter of the spinal canal and ventral compressive lesion, stenosis grade, and occupying ratio of area (ORA) and length at the MCL were measured with magnetic resonance imaging.
   RESULTS: Thirteen patients were assigned to the alarm group and 66 patients were assigned to the control group. Multivariate analysis identified ORA at the MCL (odds ratio, 1.520; 95% confidence interval, 1.192-1.37; P = 0.001) as an independent risk factor for IONM change. Immediately after decompression, the IONM change occurred. One of 4 patients who did not fully recover from the IONM change had postoperative motor deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: IONM change during COL occurred immediately after decompression, and a risk factor of IONM change was ORA at the MCL. If the IONM change was not fully recovered, a new motor deficit occurred after COL.

AB OBJECTIVE: After subarachnoid hemorrhage, delayed onset vasospasm can result in devastating ischemic stroke. The phenomenon of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is not yet fully understood, and the correlation of angiographic vasospasm and cerebral infarction is still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of endovascular treatment on the angiographic response and occurrence of DCI.
   METHODS: Eighty patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and serious cerebral vasospasm underwent endovascular treatment using intra-arterial papaverine-hydrochloride (IAP) or transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA). The angiographic response and infarction rate were classified using the pre- and postinterventional angiographic images and computed tomography scans.
   RESULTS: In 90% of patients, vasospasm could be improved. In most cases (78.8%), IAP was used. Retreatment after IAP was necessary in 32.9% of patients but never after TBA. A total of 233 vascular territories were treated in 128 procedures. Angiographic improvement was observed in 66.5% of territories, which was significantly associated with early intervention (P = 0.02), the use of TBA (P = 0.01), and the dose of papaverine-hydrochloride (P = 0.01). DCI occurred in 47.5% of the patients. Territorial infarction was associated with a poor Hunt and Hess grade (P = 0.03), day of aneurysm treatment (P = 0.01), severe vasospasm before (P = 0.02) and after (P = 0.03) treatment, and number of interventions (P = 0.01). However, the infarction rate was independent of the angiographic response.
   CONCLUSION: The discrepancy of excellent angiographic results and the high incidence of DCI might stem from an inaccurate or a delayed diagnosis of impending ischemia. In view of the limited time window, optimized peri-interventional management and continuous cerebral multimodality neuromonitoring might be crucial for the ideal timing of endovascular procedures to prevent cerebral infarctions.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify the 100 most-cited research reports on craniopharyngiomas.
   METHODS: The Thomson Reuters Web of Science service was queried for the years 1900 to 2017 without language restrictions. The articles were sorted in descending order of the number of times they had been cited by other studies, and all titles and abstracts were screened to identify the research areas of the top 100 reports. The number of citations per year was calculated.
   RESULTS: We identified the 100 most-cited articles on craniopharyngioma, which, collectively, had been cited 20,994 times at the time of our report. The top cited report had been cited 718 times, with an average of 144 citations annually since publication. The oldest article had been published in 1969 and the most recent in 2013; the most prolific decade was the 2000s, with 38 of the included articles published during that period. Thirty-two unique journals contributed to the 100 articles, with the Journal of Neurosurgery contributing most of the articles (n = 31). The most common country of article origin was the United States (n = 49), followed by United Kingdom (n = 12), Germany (n = 10), and Italy (n = 6).

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess postoperative outcomes and complications after percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) with or without epidural steroids (ES) administration in lumbar disc herniation.
   METHODS: In a double-blind randomized, placebocontrolled trial at Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, from May 2014 to May 2015, 30 patients were randomly allocated to receive ES or placebo (saline) after PELD. The primary outcome was 24-hour morphine consumption. Secondary outcomes were visual analog scale (VAS) scores for leg and back pain, Oswestry Disability Index score, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score, and complications at 6-month follow-up.
   RESULTS: Mean patient age was 60.0 years, and 0.57% of patients were male. Mean VAS hack pain, VAS leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index, and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scores at baseline were 4.7, 6.1, 24.9, 17.5 in the ES group and 5.1, 5.5, 24.7, 16.7 in the placebo group, respectively. Mean morphine requirements measured at 8, 16, and 24 hours were 3.47, 2.67, and <0.001 in the ES group and 3.13, 1.67, and 0.40 in the placebo group. The mean VAS scores measured at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours were 2.99, 2.70, 2.56, 3.30, 3.05, and 2.05 the ES group and 3.13, 1.13, 1.26, 1.65, 1.22, and 1.08 in placebo group. The difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05 for all).
   CONCLUSIONS: Administration of ES with PELD for lumbar disc herniation does not improve postoperative pain, morphine requirements, or disability scores in the short-term and midterm periods.

AB OBJECTIVE: Examining spine surgery patterns over time is crucial to provide insights into variations and changes in clinical decision making. Changes in the number of surgeries, surgical methods, reoperation rates, and cost-effectiveness were analyzed for all patients who underwent surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis in 2003 (2003 cohort) and 2008 (2008 cohort).
   METHODS: The national health insurance database was used to create the 2003 cohort (n = 10,990) and 2008 cohort (n = 27,942). The surgical methods were classified into decompression and fusion surgery. The cumulative reoperation probability between those surgeries was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method in the 2003 cohort and 2008 cohort. Comparison of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios showed the additional direct cost of a 1% change in the reoperation probability.
   RESULTS: The surgical volume increased 2.54-fold in the 2008 cohort. The age-adjusted number of surgeries per 1 million people increased 2.6-fold (from 154 in the 2003 cohort to 399 in the 2008 cohort) in aged patients and 1.9-fold (from 154 in the 2003 cohort to 291 in the 2008 cohort) in patients 20-59 years old in the 2008 cohort. The proportion of fusion surgeries increased from 20.3% in the 2003 cohort to 37.0% in the 2008 cohort. In total, the 5-year reoperation probabilities increased from 8.1% in the 2003 cohort to 11.2% in the 2008 cohort. Fusion decreased the reoperation probability by 1% at the cost of 1,711 U.S. dollars.
   CONCLUSIONS: The increased numbers of spinal surgeries, fusion surgeries, and surgeries in older patients in a recent cohort were noteworthy. However, the increased surgical volume and fusion surgeries did not reduce the reoperation rate.

AB BACKGROUND: Subdural hematoma (SDH) in the elderly is an increasingly common entity because of increased use of antithrombotic medications, an aging population, and increasing frequency of geriatric trauma. The present study describes the functional outcomes and mortality of SDH in an elderly population and to identify potential prognostic factors.
   METHODS: Patients > 65 years of age with SDH who were treated at our institution from 2005 to 2015 were identified. Patients with a history of preceding highvelocity trauma were excluded. Electronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed. The outcomes of interest were mortality, length of stay, and discharge Glasgow Outcome Score.
   RESULTS: A total of 671 patients were included in final statistical analyses. For patients with acute SDH, survival was 74.9%, 72.3%, and 69.8% at 30, 60, and 100 days, respectively. With respect to chronic SDH, survival was 87.0%, 83.7%, and 80.3% at 30, 60, and 100 days, respectively. On multivariate analysis, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was significantly predictive of mortality in both the acute and chronic populations. In the acute cohort, admission GCS score was a significant predictor of increased length of stay, whereas age > 80 years, admission GCS score, contusion volume > 10 cm(3), SDH volume > 50 cm(3), and antiplatelet use were significant predictors of discharge functional status.
   CONCLUSIONS: SDH in the elderly carries high morbidity and mortality and several prognostic factors were identified. These results can be used to guide discussions with family regarding prognosis and perhaps aid in treatment decisions.

AB BACKGROUND: Recently, the lateral supraorbital (LSO) keyhole variant of the standard pterional (PT) approach has been popularized for anterior skull base surgery, because it provides good anatomic exposition, reduced complications, and better aesthetic and functional results. However, these aspects have been formally compared only by a limited number of studies. We reviewed our experience with 50 consecutive anterior communicating artery (AComA) and A1/A2 aneurysms. Of these 50 patients, 25 had undergone the standard PT approach and 25, the LSO variant. We report the results in terms of exclusion of the aneurysm, postoperative complications, functional/masticatory outcomes, and aesthetic and patient satisfaction.
   METHODS: From January 2014 to December 2015, 25 patients with unruptured AComA and A1/A2 aneurysms underwent the standard PT craniotomy. From January 2016 to March 2017, another 25 patients underwent the LSO technique.
   RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed in the aneurysmal exclusion rate at angiographic follow-up or major complications. A statistically significant difference in the clinical outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale) was evident only for the immediate postoperative time and was not significant during the follow-up period. The hospital stay was shorter in the LSO group. Minor complications, patient satisfaction, aesthetics, and functional and masticatory outcomes were significantly better statistically in the LSO group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The LSO approach demonstrated a lower rate of early clinical minor complications, with a reduction in hospitalization. The LSO approach provides better results for patient satisfaction, masticatory comfort, and cosmetic results. In our experience, the LSO approach is a safe and effective substitute to the standard PT craniotomy to treat unruptured AComA and A1/A2 aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hyperprolactinemia in patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) has been explained by the stalk compression of large pituitary adenomas. However, not all large NFPAs are associated with high serum prolactin levels. We aimed to elucidate and compare clinical, hormonal, and radiographic characteristics of NFPAs with and without hyperprolactinemia.
   METHODS: We included 201 patients with clinically NFPAs who underwent transsphenoidal surgery performed by a single surgeon during 2010-2017 at a single center in Korea. We measured the three-dimensional diameters (anteroposterior [AP], width, height) and volumes of NFPA on magnetic resonance imaging. We conducted morning basal hormone measurements and dynamic tests preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively.
   RESULTS: All NFPAs were macroadenomas, and mean tumor volume was 10.4 +/- 7.7 cm(3). Of 201 patients, 59 (29.4%) had preoperative hyperprolactinemia. Hormone recovery rate was higher in patients with hyperprolactinemia compared with patients without hyperprolactinemia after age, sex, body mass index, tumor volume, and gross total resection adjustments (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.55 [1.10-5.92]). Tumor width/AP diameter ratio positively correlated with serum prolactin levels (r = 0.186, P = 0.008). Tumor volume was not significantly different between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative prolactin level is a useful marker to predict hormone recovery after surgery. Patients with NFPA and hyperprolactinemia tended to have a higher width/AP diameter ratio. Hyperprolactinemia of NFPA is more likely affected by tumor growth pattern, such as width/AP diameter ratio, than tumor volume.

AB BACKGROUND: Recurrences of pituitary adenomas are not so rare.
   METHODS: In the German Registry of Pituitary Tumors, more than 12,000 surgical specimens were collected between 1967 and 2012, of which 312 patients with altogether 334 recurrences (n = 646 specimens) were included in our study.
   RESULTS: The histopathology of 162 recurrent adenomas could be compared with the original tumor and 37 second recurrences could be compared with the first recurrence. Comparing the proliferation index (Ki-67) of the original and the first recurrent tumor (n = 162), we found an unchanged index in 43 cases (26%), whereas in 69 cases (43%) the index increased and in 50 cases (31%) it decreased. Comparing the first with the second recurrence in = 37), we found an unchanged index in 8 cases (22%), an increased index in 15 cases (40%), and a decreased index in 14 cases (38%). The third recurrence showed an unchanged index in 1 case (20%), an increased index in 2 cases (40%), and a decreased index in 2 cases (40%). p53 was unchanged in recurrences in 44% of cases, increased in 33%, and decreased in 22%. In 4 cases, adenomas developed into adenomas with strongly increased proliferation (formerly atypical adenomas, now aggressive adenomas) for the first recurrence, and 9 recurrences became aggressive adenomas. A change of tumor type without change of the common transcription factor occurred in 82 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: A second independent de novo adenoma was present in 10 cases, probably due to changes of transcription factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Aneurysm wall biomechanics are not yet an integral part of aneurysm rupture risk evaluation. We aimed to develop a new technique describing the biomechanical properties of aneurysm wall and correlating them to rupture status.
   METHODS: Aneurysm wall samples collected during surgery were submitted before and after freezing to tensile tests or as fresh samples to indentation tests. The lateral stiffness or the Young's modulus of the different samples was determined as a function of the mechanical test used. The impact of freezing on biomechanical properties was evaluated. The correlation of clinical and radiologic data with the biomechanical profile of the aneurysm samples was investigated. Two-photon microscopy was used to study collagen fiber organization.
   RESULTS: Sixteen aneurysm samples (11 unruptured and 5 ruptured) were included. Freezing decreased tissue stiffness. No significant difference was found between ruptured and unruptured aneurysm wall samples regarding demographic characteristics, ethnicity, smoking status, arterial hypertension, site, size and shape of the aneurysm, PHASES score, mechanical profile, or overall Young's modulus. Indentation tests found that the rupture occurred in a restricted area of increased elastic capacity and unruptured areas had increased stiffness. Two-photon microscopy found disruption of the collagen fiber network in rupture zones.
   CONCLUSIONS: The indentation test of fresh aneurysm wall samples described the heterogeneity of biomechanical properties of the tissue and found increased elastic capacity in the rupture zone and increased stiffness in the remainder of the aneurysm. This study could be a basis for further research aimed at building a biomechanical-based model of aneurysm rupture risk.

AB OBJECTIVES: The present study introduced ultrasound volume navigation (UVN) to reduce the radiation exposure and puncture time of percutaneous transpedicular puncture in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) or percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP).
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture who had undergone PVP or PKP guided by UVN or fluoroscopy from September 2017 to December 2017.
   RESULTS: We enrolled 10 patients (6 women, 4 men) with 24 pedicles involved in the present study. Significant reductions in fluoroscopy frequency (2.58 vs. 17.42; P < 0.01), exposure time (2.36 vs. 15.69 seconds; P < 0.01), and puncture time (4.13 vs. 1921 minutes; P < 0.01) for each pedicle were observed in the UVN group compared with the fluoroscopy group. Obvious correlations among fluoroscopy frequency, exposure time, and puncture time for each pedicle were observed (P < 0.01). The visual analog scale scores and Oswestry Disability Index were both significantly improved after the procedures. All patients achieved excellent or good clinical outcomes. No complications were observed in any patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: UVN could obviously reduce the radiation exposure and puncture time of percutaneous transpedicular puncture in PVP and PKP.

AB On the edge of sedimentary basins, burial of geological layers can involve the formation of confined karst aquifers. In some cases, relationships between confined and unconfined karst aquifers can exist and imply an increased difficulty in delineating contributive areas of karst system outlets with accuracy. This work aims to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to highlight groundwater exchanges between multilayered karst aquifers feeding a single spring.
   Toulon Springs, located in western France, provides the opportunity to study relationships between two multilayered karst aquifers. Hydrograph and chemograph analysis coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) are used to evaluate groundwater-flow origins on the northern edge of a sedimentary basin. Natural hydrodynamic responses (baseflow recession analysis, auto-cross correlation function) show an important volume of water located in a saturated zone of the Toulon karst system. Significant contrasts in water quality as a function of the hydrological regime (flood, recession, and baseflow regime) and comparison with shallow and deep water show the participation of a deep aquifer supporting the flow of Toulon Springs.

AB Despite of the fast development of speleothem records, oxygen isotope (delta O-18), the main paleoclimatic proxy, remains complicated in climatic interpretation. Continuous cave monitoring is essential for understanding the response of stalagmite oxygen isotope to East Asian Summer Monsoon moisture transportation. We introduce a 7 years (2010-2016) study on oxygen isotope of atmospheric precipitation, cave drips and modern speleothems at Jiguan Cave, central China, located Chinese north-south divide where is sensitive to Asian Monsoon. The monitoring covered a whole ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) cycle, from El Nino in 2010 to La Nina in 2011 and recovered another El Nino in 2015. The precipitation delta O-18 shows obvious seasonality (negative in summer and positive in winter), but air temperature and rainfall amount are not primary controlling factors. The interannual delta O-18 of precipitation corresponds with ENSO variability, which means delta O-18 value is positive during El Nino event and vice versa. We used HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model to simulate the moisture transportation for rainy season in El Nino and La Nina years, and found the Pacific contributed over 50% moisture in El Nino years and the Indian Ocean was the predominant oceanic source in La Nina year. There is no seasonality in drips delta O-18 value, while the response to ENSO variability is evident on interannual scale. The stable negative delta O-18 of drips compared with precipitation indicate there is a threshold for infiltration, suggesting cave drips are recharged by summer heavy precipitation with light delta O-18 value, but it's the mixture of latest and former rainy precipitation that recharge drips in drought, which has been verified by simple infiltration model. We found the modern speleothems were precipitated under nonequilibrium fractionation during drought years, nevertheless, they can record the El Nino related delta O-18 positive anomaly. Overall, the modern speleothems can receive the precipitation delta O-18 signal transferred by drips, and our study offers significance for verification of Asian Summer Monsoon driving force and interpretation of stalagmite delta O-18.

AB In order to assess the role of the biotic and abiotic components of natural mineral water (NMW) in the spread of allochthonous bacteria in non-thermal spa facilities, we examined the effect of low mineralized NMWs on the growth of several commensal and pathogenic human strains. These NMWs were collected from two Spanish spring spas and had different microbiological characteristics.
   Microorganisms were exposed to untreated, filtered and autoclaved NMWs at the temperatures of 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 2 days, mimicking the early stage of starvation. Starvation stress was controlled by the effect identified after incubation in saline. Changes in culturability after exposure were used as a measure of the water's antibacterial effect. The specific biotic and abiotic effect of NMWs on the suppression of bacterial growth was estimated after excluding the bacterial response to starvation stress, characteristic of this natural oligotrophic environment.
   The incubation temperature strongly modulated both the consequences of starvation and the impact of the natural biotic and abiotic components of NMWs on the growth of commensal and pathogenic bacteria. A temperature of 22 degrees C conferred cross-protection of microorganisms to starvation and NMW abiotic stress, whereas a temperature of 37 degrees C decreased the tolerance to both, and had a negative influence on the abundance and diversity of NMWs microflora. This temperature-dependent behaviour of the allochthonous and autochthonous bacteria explained the different culturability of microorganisms after exposure to untreated NMWs at 22 degrees C (approximate to 1-2.4 log colony forming units per ml -CFU/ml- mean reduction) and at 37 degrees C (approximate to 1.8-3.2 log CFU/ml mean reduction).
   Discarding the effect of starvation, we estimated that the antibacterial effect of NMWs at the temperature of 22 degrees C was mainly driven by the microecosystem of NMWs, which explained Z 95% of NMW response. In contrast, at optimal temperatures for the growth of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, 60% of the antibacterial response of NMWs was associated with the abiotic components of NMWs.
   The biotic and abiotic components of NMWs self-preserve the quality of water, preventing the progression of human pathogenic organisms that can occasionally cause water colonization. The influence of the intrinsic components of NMWs on the suppression of microbial growth is strongly modulated by environmental temperature.

AB Potential impact of climate change on the inland waterway transport of the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) have been investigated through simulations of the Hydrologiske Byran avdeling for Vattenbalans (HBV) hydrological model, the HBV-light, for the baseline, 1974-2004, and future periods of 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 over the MRB driven by precipitation and air temperature data of Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios of 10 Global Climate Models statistically downscaled by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium using the Bias-Correction Spatial Disaggregation. The average onset of spring snowmelt between 2041 and 2100 is projected to occur up to two weeks earlier than the historical (1974-2004) climate. Projected warmer temperature and higher precipitation will lead to higher runoff for MRB in winter and spring, at the expense of decreased summer streamflow and water level at Fort Simpson and Arctic Red River stations partly because projected increase in evapotranspiration will offset the projected increase in precipitation. Under a warmer climate, navigation issues related to low water levels are expected to increase, e.g., under RCP8.5 at Arctic Red River station, the number of days the water level above 5 m is projected to decrease from 74 days in 1974-2000 to 42 days in the 2080s. The summer durations that water levels of MRB will be at or above 3, 4, and 5m are projected to decrease by 2.8%-22.2%, 10.0%-34.5%, and 16.2%-43.4%, respectively, which mean navigation problems would increase because safe transit through MRB depends on its water levels.

AB A calibrated fate and reactive transport model is applied to evaluate alternative water and land best management practices (BMPs) in Colorado's intensively irrigated Arkansas River Valley to attenuate nonpoint source pollution and more closely meet regulatory standards for selenium (Se) and nitrogen (N) in groundwater and streams. Reduced irrigation (RI), lease fallowing (LF), canal sealing to reduce seepage (CS), reduced fertilizer application (RF), and enhanced riparian buffers (ERB) are explored as stand-alone BMPs, and in combination, at basic to more aggressive levels of implementation. The distributed-parameter model, which couples MODFLOW-SFR with RT3D-OTIS, predicts impacts that vary significantly over a region encompassing about 500 km(2) and across time. Results suggest that, over the course of several decades, average Se and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) groundwater concentrations within the region could be lowered by as much as 23% and 40%, respectively, using combined BMPs. Average Se concentration in the river could be decreased by up to 56% with combined BMPs, and NO3-N concentrations by up to 32% by using ERB. The CS-RF-ERB combination type may be the most promising for simultaneously lowering both Se and NO3-N concentrations. To insure compliance with Colorado water rights and the Arkansas River Compact with Kansas, measures must be taken to compensate for altered return flow patterns that will be a consequence of BMP implementation. Results also point to the need to consider the targeting of BMPs to specific locations within the region to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency.

AB Carbon-14 (C-14) has been measured in groundwater for over half a century and remains a widely used tool for understanding groundwater flow systems. Ultimately, the usefulness of C-14 as a groundwater tracer relies on the ability to distinguish between changes in concentration due to various chemical/physical processes (e.g. chemical reactions with solid carbonate material, conditions at the water table), and changes due to ageing along flow paths, the latter being most informative of groundwater flow conditions. To this end, a number of correction methodologies have been developed to account for chemical modifications in groundwater systems. In this paper, we implement two different single sample correction models, one for closed and one for open system carbonate dissolution in conjunction with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach at two sites; the sedimentary Port Willunga Formation Aquifer in South Australia and a fractured rock aquifer in the Hamersley Basin, northwest Australia. For comparison, we include argon-39 ( 39 Ar) data taken from some of the wells sampled and use a mixing envelope constraint in the MCMC procedure. We found that considering all of the errors associated with 14 C correction resulted in a distribution of values to consider for groundwater dating procedures. When accounting for all parameters associated with single sample correction techniques, the associated error was 10 times greater than the analytical errors. Additionally, inclusion of the Ar-39 data produced mixed results, with little improvement observed in the Port Willunga Aquifer (closed system correction), and a significant improvement observed at the Hamersley site (open system). This is most likely due to the mixing caused by long screens and the sensitivity of the open system correction model. Our results highlight the importance of considering all sources of error in groundwater dating studies.

AB Sustainable water resources management in most river basins needs appropriate techniques to implement the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources with consideration of uncertainties. In this study, first a linear fuzzy optimization model was used to find the optimal surface and groundwater withdrawal. Then, by using the results of this model, a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) was developed to determine the groundwater withdrawal, automatically. The capability of this approach is studied in the Astaneh-Kouchesfahan Plain in north of Iran. To do this, the groundwater of this Plain was simulated using MODFLOW code. Then, two fuzzy optimization methods were developed to minimize the water shortage. Results showed that the average water shortage was equal to 215 and 138 MCM according to current water withdrawal and the best solution for the fuzzy optimization model which was 22.0% and 14.6% of the water demand, respectively. The results of the optimization model were used to predict the optimal water withdrawal of the aquifer using the FIS, considering the predictor variables. These variables were applied to the developed FIS model under different scenarios in order to determine the best scenario with the highest prediction performance for water withdrawal from the aquifer. The evaluation criteria were coefficient of determination, normalized root mean square error, and the mean absolute error which were equal to 0.94, 0.26 MCM and 3.8 MCM, respectively for the best scenarios. These scenarios were able to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal and can replace the numerical optimization methods.

AB Flow monitoring in Urban Drainage Systems (UDS) is required for a successful system control and operational assessment. Commonly used methods can lead to erroneous results in partially filled pipes and hostile environmental conditions, normally encountered in UDS. Recent studies focused on the flow rate measurements in UDS revealed that the capability of acoustic Doppler velocimeters to estimate mean flow velocity is impeded by several factors. Most prominent issues are the operation under low flow depths and velocities, as well as in the case of the sedimentation at low flow velocities. This study is focused on an alternative method for the velocity measurements in the UDS, based on Electro-Magnetic Velocity (EMV) meters. The study also determines the sensor's capacity to operate when covered by a porous sediment layer, using a newly developed procedure. A brief theoretical background is given to support the idea behind the usage of EMV in UDS. Measurement uncertainties were firstly benchmarked in the laboratory flume without sediment. After local, site-specific (re) calibration, EMV operated with combined uncertainty of only few cm/s. Furthermore, the EMV measured the flow rates with depths low as 4 cm and velocities bellow 5 cm/s. Additionally, a series of tests were performed with sediment layers above the EMV meter, varying in height from 0 to 80 mm. Observational uncertainty analysis showed that EMV meter can be used even in these conditions. Since the bias uncertainty increased with the rise of the sediment depth, a correction function model was derived for the transformation of the output signal, reducing the observational uncertainties below 5 cm/s. Subsequently, practical implications of the EMV usage in the UDS are considered.

AB To capture the temporal variability of parameters of hydrological models, the segmented optimization algorithm (SOA) is usually used which subdivides the calibration period into a number of sub-periods and seeks optimal parameters for each sub-period by optimizing the objective function based on the measured and estimated data in the same sub-period. In this paper, we developed a new method that is called a progressive segmented optimization algorithm (PSOA), which seeks optimal parameters by optimizing the objective function based on both the current and all the prior sub-periods.
   We applied and compared the SOA and PSOA algorithms to the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) in simulating snow-melt streamflow for the Manasi River basin, northwest of China, during snowmelt seasons of 2001-2012. The study showed: (1) PSOA can effectively calibrate the time-variant model parameters while avoiding too much computational time caused by a significant increase of parameter dimensionality. (2) PSOA outperforms SOA for both single-snowmelt-season and multi-snowmelt-season simulations. (3) For single-snowmelt-season simulation, the length of the sub-period has an apparent effect on model performance, the shorter the sub-period is, the better the model performance will be, when the model is calibrated using the PSOA method. (4) For multi-snowmelt-season simulation, an over-short sub-period may cause overfitting problems in some cases such as the situation of taking Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) as the objective function. A compromised length of sub-period and objective function may have to be chosen as a trade-off among evaluation criteria and between the importance of calibration and validation.

The objective of the MPC is to apply a proactive management strategy that uses optimised time-state schedules for operating the actuators of UDS in real time. Aiming to mitigate flooding consequences, the MPC uses EPA-SWMM hydrologic-hydraulic simulation engine and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimise the time-state schedules for the actuators of UDS. The efficiency of the MPC was tested on the Lille University Campus, resulting in satisfying improvements in the use of storage capacity of retention elements within the UDS.

AB Mediterranean rivers are affected by natural disturbances and human pressures, which may alter their hydrology, water quality and habitat structure. In this study an analysis of macroinvertebrates community structure has been used to determine how distinct human pressures, such as point and non-point sources of pollution, together with groundwater withdrawal, may affect these ecosystems. A total of 4 sampling campaigns were conducted in the middle reach of the Onyar River (NE Spain), which was affected by agricultural and urban uses. Stream discharge and physicochemical parameters were measured in situ, and water samples and macroinvertebrates assemblages were taken and properly preserved for subsequent analysis and identification. Variation partitioning showed that macroinvertebrate community structure was particularly dependent on hydrochemical characteristics, but also on hydrological variations. In addition, results indicated that groundwater withdrawal altered stream hydrology, and the main reach of the Onyar River became intermittent and even completely dry in downstream positions. This reduction on stream discharge caused changes in habitat characteristics, as well as in the proportion of wastewater. Some wastewater dilution occurred, linked to groundwater with high nitrate concentrations inputs to the stream, and even though the macroinvertebrate community recovered its quality in some sampling campaigns, it presented a different structure than in sampling points not affected by any of these pressures. Therefore, the approach here used to analyze the hydrological effects on macroinvertebrate communities allowed us to determine their influence on hydrochemical and habitat characteristics.

AB Although erosional impacts of rainforest logging are well established, changes in hydrological dynamics have been less explored especially in the post-logging recovery phase following repeat-logging cycles and mature phase of oil palm plantation cycles. This study addresses this gap by comparing hydrological characteristics of five catchments in a steep land area of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo on a gradient of disturbance and recovery - twice-logged forest, 22 years recovery (LF2); multiple-logged forest, 8 years recovery (LF3); mature oil palm, 20 years old (OP); and two primary forests (PF and VJR) as controls. Each catchment was instrumented with water depth (converted to discharge), conductivity, temperature, and turbidity sensors, and a raingauge connected to a solar-powered datalogger recording data at 5-minute intervals from November 2011 to August 2013. Data were analysed via the flow-duration curve (FDC) supplemented by the runoff coefficient (RR) and coefficient of variation in discharge (QVAR) for aggregated characteristics, as well as via a combination of the Dunn's test and multiple-regression at the storm event scale for focused hydrological dynamics. Results show that OP is characterised by a relatively low RR (0.357) but with high responsiveness during storm events and very low baseflow (38.4% of total discharge). Discharge in the LF3 (RR = 0.796) is always the highest while having an intermediate level of responsiveness. LF2 with longer-term recovery shown a reduction in terms of discharge (RR = 0.640). Being the benchmark, the undisturbed forest (PF) has the most buffered storm response with the highest baseflow (67.9% of total discharge). Stormflow and baseflow are anomalously high and low respectively in the near-primary VJR catchment, but this probably reflects the shallow soils and short-stature rainforest associated with its igneous and metamorphic lithology. From a management aspect, although hydrological recovery is more advanced in the 22 years than in the 8-years post-logging catchment, full recovery is yet to be achieved and might be hastened by enrichment planting of the degraded forest. The low baseflow and flashy nature of the mature oil palm have major implications for downstream water supply in ENSO periods and flooding in La Nina periods. Steep lands in the humid tropics are best avoided from any form of landscape disturbance.

AB This paper presents the calibration and evaluation of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), an operational system that produces ensemble streamflow forecasts and threshold exceedance probabilities for large rivers worldwide. The system generates daily streamflow forecasts using a coupled H-TESSEL land surface scheme and the LISFLOOD model forced by ECMWF IFS meteorological forecasts. The hydrology model currently uses a priori parameter estimates with uniform values globally, which may limit the streamflow forecast skill. Here, the LISFLOOD routing and groundwater model parameters are calibrated with ECMWF reforecasts from 1995 to 2015 as forcing using daily streamflow data from 1287 stations worldwide. The calibration of LISFLOOD parameters is performed using an evolutionary optimization algorithm with the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) as objective function. The skill improvements are quantified by computing the skill scores as the change in KGE relative to the baseline simulation using a priori parameters. The results show that simulation skill has improved after calibration (KGE skill score > 0.08) for the large majority of stations during the calibration (67% globally and 77% outside of North America) and validation (60% globally and 69% outside of North America) periods compared to the baseline simulation. However, the skill gain was impacted by the bias in the baseline simulation (the lowest skill score was obtained in basins with negative bias) due to the limitation of the model in correcting the negative bias in streamflow. Hence, further skill improvements could be achieved by reducing the bias in the streamflow by improving the precipitation forecasts and the land surface model. The results of this work will have implications on improving the operational GloFAS flood forecasting (www.globalfloods.eu).

AB Associated with Taylor dispersion, in this paper we analyze how the vertical position of a point-source solute release will affect the transport process in laminar open channel flow, through obtaining and applying analytical solution by the two-scale perturbation analysis (Wu and Chen, 2014, J. Fluid Mech., 740, 196-213), which is verified and supported by results from numerical simulations. Based on multi-dimensional spatial concentration distribution of the solute plume, we resort to the previously proposed criterion for identifying the stage of solute transport characterized by the dispersion-dominated (Taylor dispersion) regime, focusing on the relative uniformity of concentration distribution across a given family of curved surfaces (Wu et al., 2016, Sci. Rep., 6, 20556). The most important finding is that for the solute transport transition into the dispersion-dominated regime, the necessary time is about 50% more for the case of solute release at free water surface compared with that at the channel bed, which is substantial under typical physical parameters. Other effects of release position include affecting the displacement of the solute plume centroid, the value of the maximum mean concentration, and non-Gaussian properties regarding the form of the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration.

AB The state-of-the-art genetic programming (GP) method is an evolutionary algorithm for automatic generation of computer programs. In recent decades, GP has been frequently applied on various kind of engineering problems and undergone speedy advancements. A number of studies have demonstrated the advantage of GP to solve many practical problems associated with water resources engineering (WRE). GP has a unique feature of introducing explicit models for nonlinear processes in the WRE, which can provide new insight into the understanding of the process. Considering continuous growth of GP and its importance to both water industry and academia, this paper presents a comprehensive review on the recent progress and applications of GP in the WRE fields. Our review commences with brief explanations on the fundamentals of classic GP and its advanced variants (including multigene GP, linear GP, gene expression programming, and grammar-based GP), which have been proven to be useful and frequently used in the WRE. The representative papers having wide range of applications are clustered in three domains of hydrological, hydraulic, and hydroclimatological studies, and outlined or discussed at each domain. Finally, this paper was concluded with discussions of the optimum selection of GP parameters and likely future research directions in the WRE are suggested.

AB The climate change is an important event that affects hydrological, agricultural and water resources planning variables, and therefore, the hydrologists and meteorologists frequently try to identify trend possibilities especially in rainfall, runoff and temperature time series. For this purpose, the classical Mann-Kendall (MK), Spearman's rho (SR), Sen's slope, and linear regression approaches are applied frequently in the literature. Recently, innovative trend analysis (ITA) provides visual inspection and identification of categorical trends, which is one of the main concerns in this paper. On the basis of ITA methodology, several improvements namely double-ITA (D-ITA) and triple-ITA (T-ITA) procedures are suggested using with simple ITA together. These methods are attractive for the trend stability assessment by comparing partial trend components during different sub-periods of a given record series. Furthermore, partial MK test approach is proposed in this paper for the same purpose. These procedures and approach are applied to a set of annual rainfall records at many stations in different regions of Turkey. As a result, the comparison of the suggested methods based on partial sub-series of the same time series helps to improve trend detection with stability identification.

AB A particle-tracking algorithm was developed to simulate colloid transport subject to wall effects on diffusion as well as colloid surface attachment as described by DLVO kinetics. The effects of spatially variable fracture surface potential, which contributed to spatially variable attachment strength affecting colloid transport, were investigated. The fracture surface potential was assumed to be either positively, neutrally (zero), or negatively correlated with the lognormally distributed local fracture aperture, described with a mean, variance, and isotropic correlation length. The results from several model simulations indicated that wall effects were negligible for the synthetic fractures studied here. When fracture surface potential was negatively correlated with local aperture, colloids were preferentially transported through the fracture, because they tended to enter high-flow, large-aperture regions where they underwent less attachment (have the largest first moment measured upon exit of the first colloid from the fracture). The variance (second moment) increased for flowing colloids when comparing negatively to zero and then positively correlated surface potentials to fracture apertures, because spreading notably increased when suspended colloids were temporarily attached onto fracture surfaces. For colloids attached onto fracture surfaces, both first and second moments decreased from negatively, to neutrally (zero), to positively correlated surface potentials to apertures. This is an intuitive result, consistent with fewer colloids attaching along the larger aperture preferential flow paths.

AB Accurate prediction of the long-term average dimensions of alluvial stable channels is a significant problem in river engineering. The goal of this research is to investigate the effect of flow discharge (Q), mean sediment size (d(50)) and Shields parameter (tau*) on the stable channel dimensions by employing non-linear regression (NLR) and two Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, including: Generalized Structure of Group Method of Data Handling (GS-GMDH) neural network and Gene Expression Programming (GEP). Discharge, grain size and Shields parameter from 85 gaging stations situated in three stable Iranian rivers were used as input data for the three methods to estimate the water-surface width (W), average flow depth (D) and longitudinal slope (S) of the rivers. Based on the results, it was found that the GS-GMDH produced more accurate results for simulating the channel width with a Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) value of 0.055; and GEP produced better estimations for channel depth and slope with MARE values of 0.035 and 0.03, respectively. Furthermore, by employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods (GS-GMDH and GEP), the RMSE values decreased by 22%, 25% and 75% in predicting width, depth, and slope, respectively, compared to NLR method. The overall results showed that the AI methods generally produced better estimations than the non-linear regression method. To determine the effect of each input variable (Q, d(50), tau*) on the target variables (W, D, S), a sensitivity analysis comprising various combinations of input variables was conducted. Based on the results, the flow discharge had a dominant role on depth and width estimation of stable channels. In slope estimation, the most important parameter was tau* and then d(50), while the discharge had a weak effect on slope prediction. In general, the Shields parameter was the most effective parameter in depth and specially slope estimation of stable channels.

AB Large-scale in situ soil moisture monitoring networks are becoming increasingly valuable research tools, but existing networks feature almost exclusive deployment of stations in grassland vegetation. These grassland soil moisture observations are unlikely to adequately represent the real soil moisture patterns in landscapes with intermixed land cover types. Here we demonstrate the severity of the problem for one particular landscape and introduce a flexible new method for solving the problem. The specific objectives of this study were (i) to compare root-zone soil moisture dynamics of two dominant vegetation types across Oklahoma, grassland (observed) and winter wheat cropland (simulated); (ii) to relate the soil moisture dynamics of grassland and cropland vegetation using an artificial neural network (ANN) as an observation operator; and (iii) to use the resulting ANN to estimate the soil moisture spatial patterns for a landscape of intermixed grassland and wheat cropland. Rootzone soil moisture was represented by plant available water (PAW) in the top 0.8 m of the soil profile. PAW under grassland was calculated from 18 years of soil moisture observations at 83 stations of the Oklahoma Mesonet, whereas PAW under winter wheat was simulated for the same 83 locations using a calibrated and validated soil water balance model. Then, we trained an ANN to reproduce the simulated PAW under winter wheat using only six inputs: day of the year, latitude and longitude, measured PAW under grassland, and percent sand and clay. The resulting ANN was used, along with grassland soil moisture observations, to estimate the detailed soil moisture pattern for a 9 x 9 km(2) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) grid cell. The seasonal dynamics of root-zone PAW for grassland and winter wheat were strongly asynchronous, so grassland soil moisture observations rarely reflect cropland soil moisture conditions in the region. The simple ANN approach facilitated efficient and accurate prediction of the simulated PAW under winter wheat, RMSD = 21 mm and normalized RMSD = 0.17, using observed PAW under grassland as an input. This new method for estimating soil moisture under adjacent, contrasting land covers at a relatively low computational cost could be employed for any region and land cover pairing with training data available, and it may significantly enhance the applications of existing large-scale soil moisture monitoring networks.

AB Opencast mining operations frequently lead to the creation of large voids that become anthropogenic lakes when the water table recovers. In the case of sulfide mining the stored water is of an acidic nature with significant concentrations of toxic metals and, therefore, a high pollutant potential. The main goal of the present work is to characterize the hydrological functioning and evolution of four acidic mine pit lakes in the abandoned mines of Tharsis, which is the second most important mine district in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB). We present a simple methodology based on the use of the available orthophotographs and a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) together with the water balance of the pit lakes, which could be applied to other abandoned mining sites, where there is often a lack of hydrogeological information that prevents the application of more complex models. The accumulation of large volumes (5.2 x 10(6) m(3)) of acidic and metal-rich waters in these pit lakes poses a serious environmental concern, with dissolved concentrations up to 2000 mg/L of Fe, 223 mg/L of Al, etc. Sierra Bullones and Fil6n Norte are connected underground and present the same evolution, with water transfers from Sierra Bullones to Filon Norte. The water level in both pit lakes is increasing, with an average rise of 2.8 m/yr since the beginning of flooding. However, the increase in the evaporation rate, as a result of the larger flooded area as the water level rise, would induce a hydrological equilibrium before reaching the overflow level, leading to the formation of a terminal lake. On the other hand, the water level in Fib% Centro and Filon Sur pit lakes remain approximately stable. The first behaves as a flow-through or terminal lake, depending on the annual rainfall, while the second acts permanently as a flow-through lake.

AB We assess the impacts of a range of short-term climate change scenarios (2020-2050) on the hydrology of the Mara River Basin in East Africa using a new high-resolution (0.25 degrees) daily climate dataset. The scenarios combine natural climate variability, as captured by a vector autoregressive (VAR) model, with a range of climate trends calculated from 31 models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The methodology translates these climate scenarios into plausible daily sequences of climate variables utilizing the Agricultural Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (AgMERRA) dataset. The new dataset (VARAG) has several advantages over traditional general circulation model outputs, such as, the statistical representation of short-term natural climate variability, availability at a daily time scale and high spatial resolution, not requiring additional downscaling, and the use of the AgMERRA data which is bias-corrected extensively. To assess the associated impacts on basin hydrology, the semi-distributed Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land-surface model is forced with the climate scenarios, after being calibrated for the study area using the fine-resolution (0.05 degrees) merged satellite and in-situ observation-based dataset, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). The climate data are further bias-corrected by applying a non-parametric quantile mapping scheme, where the cumulative distribution functions are approximated using kernel densities. Three different wetness scenarios (dry, average, and wet) are analyzed to see the potential shortterm changes in the basin. We find that the precipitation bias correction is more in effect in the mountainous subbasins, one of which also shows the maximum difference between the wet and dry scenario streamflows. Precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture show increasing trends mostly during the primary rainy season, while no trend is found in the corresponding streamflows. The annual values of these variables also do not change much in the coming three decades. The methodology implemented in this study provides a reliable range of possibilities which can greatly benefit risk analysis and infrastructure designing, and shows potential to be applied to other basins.

AB A major challenge in predicting the response of both social-hydrological and social-ecological systems to environmental change is the lack of a causal framework for predicting thresholds of change between the linked social and natural components. Here we propose a social-ecohydrological thresholds (SEHT) framework that integrates social-hydrological, trait-based ecological, and ecosystem services concepts. This approach facilitates the identification of thresholds by treating ecosystem services as indicators of the coupling of social and natural components of the system. Using the San Pedro riparian corridor in Arizona as a case study, we implemented the SEHT framework using ecological research and stakeholder perspectives to identify key drivers and thresholds in the social-ecohydrological system. In this way, we were able to describe expected outcomes of different hydrological change scenarios on the system. Stakeholders provided input on the utility of this information to inform management decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of environmental change. The SEHT framework provides insight on dynamics of ecosystem services. This paper demonstrates that application of the framework enables the identification of several critical drivers of potential thresholds in ecosystem services that derive from either natural or social components of the overall system. These potential thresholds can guide ecosystem service assessment and monitoring and provide a roadmap for environmental management and the development of management scenarios.

AB Emitter discharge is one of the most important parameters considered in the design, operation, and management of subsurface irrigation systems. The emitter discharge, if properly chosen, can eliminate surface runoff and minimize deep percolation water losses. The discharge from a ceramic emitter depends on the working pressure head and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity, so it is important to determine the optimal working levels for these two design parameters. In this work, it is confirmed that the HYDRUS-2D predictions of the cumulative infiltration and the horizontal wetting front are in good agreement with experimental results, and that the Hydrus-2D model can be used to accurately simulate soil water movement under subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters. Additional simulations with HYDRUS-2D were used to study the effects of various design parameters (i.e. working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity) on emitter discharges in soils, deep percolation and soil wetting fronts. Results show that both the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity have significant impact on the discharge of emitters in soil, and the deep percolation water losses. The emitter discharge in soil decreases with time and finally stabilizes. When the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity are higher, the stable discharge (emitter discharge in soil at 120 h) is greater, and this situation may increase the risk of deep percolation. The relationship between the working pressure head, ceramic hydraulic conductivity, and stable discharge is developed as a power function. To satisfy the water requirements of trees with an active layer of root systems down to about 0-100 cm in the Loess Plateau in China and reduce the risk of deep percolation, it is recommended that the working pressure head should be 20-50 cm of water and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity should be between 0.1 and 1.9 cm h(-1).

AB The paper examines the formation of clique-spanning ties in infra-corporate co-invention networks, by focusing on the impact of R&D unit spinouts. Using data on thirty-one spinouts in eight large U.S. information and communication technology corporations, we show that the reorganization of R&D units through corporate spinouts is associated with an increase in the extent to which inventors employed in the unit collaborate with inventors located in other cliques within the corporate co-invention network. Interestingly, the spinout effect spills over to all members of the clique of spun-out inventors, also including those who remain with the parent firm. The interpretation of these empirical findings, grounded on existing theories and on the views of inventors and executives involved in the reorganization events, suggests that corporate spinouts generate a shock in intracorporate research collaboration dynamics, which loosens clique lock-in effects and contributes to reset cliques' boundaries in the infra-corporate research network.

AB Pasteur's Quadrant model, published by Stokes in 1997, presents a two-dimensional abstract conceptual framework that proved immensely helpful to study and discuss institutional and policy arrangements in science. However, during the last 10 years the PQ model was also applied in a series of large-scale, survey-based studies worldwide to classify individual modern-day researchers according to their research orientation and performance.
   This paper argues that such applications are inadequate to capture key characteristics of individual researchers, especially those within the heterogeneous 'Pasteur type' group who engage in 'use-inspired' basic scientific research. Addressing this shortcoming, Pasteur's Cube (PC) model introduces a new heuristic tool. Departing from a three-dimensional conceptual framework of research-related activities, the model enables a range of typologies to describe and study the large variety of academics at today's research-intensive universities. The PC model's analytical robustness was tested empirically in two interrelated 'proof of concept' studies: an exploratory survey among 150 European universities and a follow-up case study of Leiden University in the Netherlands. Both studies, collecting data for the years 2010-2015, applied a metrics-based taxonomy to classify individual academic researchers according to four performance categories: scientific publication output, research collaboration with the business sector, patents filings, and being engaging in entrepreneurial activities.
   The collective results of both studies provide more clarity on relevant subgroups of use-inspired researchers. The PC model can be used to guide empirical, metrics-based investigations of research activities and productivities, applies this approach to two case studies, and demonstrates the utility of the method while also reinforcing and enriching the growing body of literature showing that cross-sectoral and cross-functional research activities are more scientifically productive than research carried out in isolation of the context of use. Introducing the 'Crossover Collaborator' subtype helps to explain why Pasteur type researchers tend to outperform other types of researchers in terms of publication output and citation impact.

AB Despite the critical role of regulations on competition and innovation, little is known about firm responses and related effects on performance under regulatory contingencies that are permissive or restrictive. By longitudinally investigating hybrid cars competing in the Le Mans Prototype racing (LMP1), we counter-intuitively suggest that permissive regulations increase technological uncertainty and thus decrease the firms' likelihood of shifting their technological trajectory, while restrictive regulations lead to the opposite outcome. Further, we suggest that permissive regulations favour firms that innovate their products by sequentially upgrading core and peripheral subsystems, while restrictive regulations (in the long term) favour firms upgrading them simultaneously. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

AB Recent research on employee-level innovation focuses on scientists' ability to source advanced knowledge and use it to create new ideas and innovation within a firm. The present paper introduces a new dimension to this literature: functional departments. We argue that functional centrality, namely the extent to which a functional department is central in the intra-organizational network, affects employees' innovation intensity. We make use of a rich novel dataset at the employee-level for the Telenor Group, based on a large-scale survey among nearly 16,000 employees in all business units and functions of the company. The empirical results point out that employees' innovation intensity is higher in departments that are centrally positioned in the company's internal network. Task characteristics such as quality orientation, entrepreneurial attitude and result pressure moderate the relationship between centrality and innovation.

AB Technological acquisitions have become a popular complement to internal innovation in order to overcome the time-compression diseconomies of internal innovation. As such, acquisition success greatly depends on the expeditious leveraging of target knowledge. Confounding our understanding of leveraging target knowledge is that targets play two distinct innovative roles post-acquisition: conduct innovative activities in conjunction with acquirers (integrative innovation) and continue innovative activities independent of acquirers (independent innovation). To understand how factors differentially affect these two types of innovation, I connect two disparate concepts: relative absorptive capacity and selective intervention. I develop theory and find evidence that while relative absorptive capacity creates the communication capabilities that accelerate integrative innovation, it simultaneously deteriorates the information asymmetries between targets and acquirers leading to greater opportunities for acquirer intervention into target innovative activities that delay independent innovation.

AB Innovative, high-technology industries are commonly described as drivers of regional development. 'Tech' workers earn high wages, but they are also said to generate knock-on effects throughout the local economies that host them, spurring growth in jobs and wages in nontradable activities. At the same time, in iconic high-tech agglomerations like the San Francisco Bay Area, the home of Silicon Valley, the success of the tech industry creates tensions, in part as living costs rise beyond the reach of many non-tech workers. Across a large sample of U.S. cities, this paper explores these issues systematically. Combining annual data on wages, employment and prices from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Price Index, it estimates how growth in tradable tech employment affects the real, living-cost deflated wages of local workers in nontradable sectors. Results indicate that high-technology employment has significant, positive, but modest effects on the real wages of workers in nontradable sectors. These effects appear to be spread consistently across different kinds of nontradable activities. In terms of substantive wider impacts, tech appears benign, though fairly ineffectual.

AB To successfully generate more valuable technologies from accessing basic research knowledge, firms need to combine institutional and individual level bridges to universities and research institutes active in basic research. This combination is particularly important when the new technology builds on scientific prior art. While mobile inventors are needed to transfer and translate basic knowledge into new technologies, partnerships provide the commitment, resources and incentive structure to integrate this basic research knowledge more effectively into the firm's innovation process, thus improving the value capture from mobile inventors. Our findings in the micro-electronics field illustrate the importance of jointly accounting for firm and inventor level industry-science links to assess their effectiveness and provides evidence on complementarity from using both. Furthermore, identifying the scientific nature of the technology projects critically determines whether the combination of these links allow to capture more value.

AB Professional connections between the creators and evaluators of scientific work are ubiquitous, and the possibility of bias ever-present. Although connections have been shown to bias predictions of uncertain future performance, it is unknown whether such biases occur in the more concrete task of assessing scientific validity for completed works, and if so, how. This study presents evidence that connections between authors and reviewers of neuroscience manuscripts are associated with biased judgments and explores the mechanisms driving that effect. Using reviews from 7981 neuroscience manuscripts submitted to the journal PLOS ONE, which instructs reviewers to evaluate manuscripts on scientific validity alone, we find that reviewers favored authors close in the co-authorship network by similar to 0.11 points on a 1.0-4.0 scale for each step of proximity. PLOS ONE's validity focused review and the substantial favoritism shown by distant vs. very distant reviewers, both of whom should have little to gain from nepotism, point to the central role of substantive disagreements between scientists in different professional networks ("schools of thought"). These results suggest that removing bias from peer review cannot be accomplished simply by recusing closely connected reviewers, and highlight the value of recruiting reviewers embedded in diverse professional networks.

AB Background: Information on how sarcoidosis affects one's ability to work is needed to clarify the burden of disease on the individual and society. Our aim was to describe the work ability of individuals with sarcoidosis before and after diagnosis compared to people without sarcoidosis.
   Methods: Swedish national registers were used to identify adults diagnosed with sarcoidosis aged 25-59 years old and matched general population comparators without sarcoidosis 2006-2012. Information on work loss (days of sick leave and disability pension) and earnings (gross salary) was collected from the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market Studies. Mean earnings and work loss days per year from 5 years before to 5 years after diagnosis were calculated.
   Results: During diagnosis year, sarcoidosis patients (n = 3347) earned 8% less and registered 26 more work loss days than comparators (n = 33,407). The number of work loss days was higher than the general population in the years leading up to sarcoidosis diagnosis. Five years after diagnosis, the number of total work loss days decreased among sarcoidosis patients, but remained higher than that of the general population. Individuals who were older, female, less educated and received treatment at diagnosis registered the highest number of work loss days and had the largest difference in earnings at all time points.
   Conclusions: Individuals with sarcoidosis experience a reduction in work ability which persists for up to five years after diagnosis. Interventions targeted at getting sarcoidosis patients back to work should be evaluated.

AB Introduction: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease associated with myriad symptoms, including fatigue. It can affect physiological processes like sleep, leading to poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. We hypothesized that sarcoidosis patients would report more severe sleep disturbance than healthy controls and that relationships would be found with sleep disturbance and the severity of other symptoms.
   Methods: We enrolled 84 sarcoidosis patients and 30 healthy controls and recorded demographic and clinical characteristics. Self-report measures were used to assess sleep disturbance, psychosocial symptoms, and quality of life at enrollment and longitudinally. Relationships between different self-report outcomes were analyzed using correlation statistics.
   Results: Using the General Sleep Disturbance Scale, 54% of sarcoidosis patients reported frequent and occasional sleep disturbance compared to only 17% of healthy controls (p < 0.0001). This significant increase in sleep disturbance found in sarcoidosis patients strongly correlated with multiple psychosocial symptoms, including fatigue, depression, and cognitive dysfunction, and negatively impacted quality of life (p < 0.01). Traditional measures of sarcoidosis disease severity or activity were not associated with sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance scores remained stable at follow-up (mean time between first and last administration of questionnaire was 17.3 months) in 56 of the sarcoidosis patients.
   Conclusions: Sarcoidosis patients experienced significant sleep disturbance that correlated with higher levels of fatigue, depression, and cognitive dysfunction, and poorer quality of life. These associations were present regardless of disease severity or activity and result in decrements in quality of life and mental health.

TI Sarcoidosis and IPF in the same patient-a coincidence, an association or
   a phenotype?
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; Sarcoidosis; Interstitial lung disease;
   Usual interstitial pneumonia
ID PULMONARY-FIBROSIS; DISTINCT
AB Background: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and Sarcoidosis are distinct clinical entities. Fibrotic disease in pulmonary sarcoidosis is typically upper lobe predominant. In IPF fibrosis is basilar and peripheral predominant [usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern]. Sarcoidosis and UIP have rarely been observed in the same patient. We sought to characterize patients manifesting both sarcoidosis and IPF and compare clinical features and survival to that of patients with "Lone-IPF" (IPF only) and pulmonary sarcoidosis with fibrosis in a non-UIP pattern.
   Methods: Patients were identified from a clinical database and data abstracted from medical records (1995-2016): 1) 25 patients with combined sarcoidosis and IPF (CSIPF) defined by clinical and histological features of sarcoidosis and HRCT features of possible or definite UIP or UIP by histopathology; 2) Randomly selected control patients during the same period: 28 Lone-IPF, 25 stage III/IV pulmonary sarcoidosis.
   Results: The gender and race of patients with CSIPF and Lone-IPF patients were similar (68% male and 84% Caucasian), as were survival outcomes. Mean time from IPF diagnosis to death: 3.2 years CSIPF, 3.6 years Lone-IPF (log rank p value 0.49). Among patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, mean time from diagnosis to death: 21.4 years.
   Conclusions: Clinical characteristics/behavior of patients with CSIPF was similar to Lone-IPF patients. It is possible that patients with sarcoidosis coincidentally developed IPF and/or have occult genetic predisposition factors to manifest both diseases at different time points. Further study is needed.

AB Background: The prevalence and incidence of sarcoidosis, a granulomatous disorder involving multiple organ systems, varies among geographical regions and ethnicities. This study evaluated the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of sarcoidosis in a large nationwide population-based cohort in Korea.
   Methods: We used data of the National Health Insurance Service database, which is an extensive health-related database including most Korean residents. Adults with a primary diagnosis of sarcoidosis, as determined by International Classification of Disease-Tenth Revision coding (D86), were identified between 2003 and 2015. The incidence, prevalence, and mortality of sarcoidosis were analysed by sex and age.
   Results: A total of 6376 individuals had a primary diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Their mean age was 48.8 years, and 58.6% were women. The age-adjusted incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis were 1.3 and 3.4 per 100,000 population respectively; both tended to increase between 2003 and 2015. The all-cause mortality rate was 13.1 per 1000 sarcoidosis patients. The standardised mortality ratio of sarcoidosis patients to the general population was 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 1.8).
   Conclusions: This is the largest epidemiologic study of sarcoidosis in an Asian population to date. In Korea, the annual incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis were relatively low but tended to increase over the 13 years of the study period. Importantly, the overall mortality rate of patients with sarcoidosis was higher than that of the general population.

ID CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS; MYOCARDIAL SARCOIDOSIS; METAANALYSIS;

AB Introduction: The diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is difficult to ascertain due to the insensitivity of endomyocardial biopsy. Current diagnostic criteria require a positive endomyocardial biopsy or extra-cardiac biopsy with clinical features suggestive of CS. Common tests for diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis include bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung and mediastinal lymph node (MLN) biopsies. Our objective was to determine the diagnostic utility of these tests in patients with suspected CS and without prior history of pulmonary involvement.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 37 patients without history of extra-cardiac sarcoidosis referred for suspected CS. All patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) staged using the modified Scadding criteria, and had BAL, and/or lung or MLN biopsy. BAL cellular analyses with lymphocytes > 15% and/or CD4/CD8 ratio >= 4 were considered suggestive of sarcoidosis. The number of positive biopsies and BALs were compared between normal CT (Scadding stage 0) and abnormal CT (Scadding stage 1-4) groups.
   Results: A definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis was ascertained in 18/31 (58%) patients undergoing lung or lymph node biopsy, and a potential diagnosis in 18/27 (67%) patients with BAL CD4/CD8 > 4 or lymphocytes > 15%. Of the 12 patients in the normal CT group, 4/10 (40%) had positive lung biopsies, and 9/12 (75%) patients had either positive biopsy or BAL criteria.
   Conclusions: In suspected cardiac sarcoidosis, a diagnosis of extra-cardiac sarcoidosis was ascertained in a majority of patients irrespective of degree of lung involvement on chest CT. Our results support referral for pulmonary biopsy/bronchoalveolar lavage in suspected CS to confirm the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

   INTERNAL CAPSULE; DETERIORATION; HEMORRHAGE; PATIENT; TRACT
AB BACKGROUND: Supratentorial stroke manifesting as ipsilateral hemiparesis is rare. Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms are possible for this unusual phenomenon and has been previously described. Its implication in therapeutic decision making in a patient with an acute emergent condition has never been discussed. We describe our experience with a patient with this unusual presentation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 44-year-old woman presented with acute-onset right hemiparesis and left facial weakness. Evaluation with computed tomography angiography showed right M3 segment occlusion. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on arrival was 9. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which showed ongoing ischemia in the right frontotemporal cortex. She underwent endovascular thrombectomy, and complete revascularization was achieved. Postoperatively, the patient experience complete neurologic recovery. Further diffusion tractography imaging showed near-complete nondecussation of corticospinal fibers.
   CONCLUSIONS: Discordance between clinical and initial computed tomography angiography findings in a patient with acute ischemic stroke poses a management challenge. Additional imaging to correlate clinical findings in equivocal cases may help in decision making but may significantly delay intervention, and therefore its utility during the short therapeutic window period needs careful consideration. Considering the risks and benefits, timely intervention should be balanced judiciously against appropriate intervention to achieve a positive patient outcome.

DE Cephalad; Gunshot wound; Intradural; Migration
ID INTRASPINAL BULLET; SYMPTOMS; INJURIES
AB BACKGROUND: There are few reported instances of intraspinal migration of mullet fragment. The majority of these migrations occur caudally, typically below the level of T10. Even fewer cases demonstrate cephalad migration from the sacral spine to the lumbar spine. We report here for the first time a case of a cephalad migration intradurally from the thoracic spine to cervical spine.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year old man presented to the emergency department with a suspected spinal cord injury following a GSW sustained to the left shoulder. A penetrating gunshot injury to the thoracic spine at the level of T2 was observed, and CT angiography revealed a cephalad migration of the bullet fragment to the level of C6. The patient had marked weakness of the bilateral upper extremities, with paraplegia of the lower extremities. There was a sensory deficit beginning at a level 1 cm below the clavicle, as well as a decrease in rectal tone. We performed a laminectomy at C6 with dural incision and removal of the main bullet fragment. Following the surgery, significant improvement in strength and sensation in the bilateral upper extremities was noted, but paraplegia and sensory loss below the level of T2 persisted.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this report, we review the previously reported cases in which intraspinal migration of bullets have occurred, and discuss the unique finding in this study of cephalad migration of a bullet within the dura. In addition, we detail considerations in the management of such injuries.

DE Aneurysm; Embolization; Flow diversion; Stenting; Thromboembolism
ID FLOW DIVERTORS; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic complications remain a major reason for morbidity and mortality after flow diversion, in addition to hemorrhagic complications not limited to the brain predicated on the prolonged need for dual antiplatelet therapy. Surface modification to decrease thrombogenicity and accelerate aneurysm occlusion is a promising alteration to mitigate those risks. The Pipeline embolization device with Shield Technology possesses such characteristics; however, it has not yet been approved in the United States.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 38-year-old woman with a Spetzler-Martin grade 4 left parietal arteriovenous malformation with a total of 8 feeding vessel aneurysms and recent rupture of 1 of those aneurysms that was treated with balloon-assisted coil embolization. Four M1-segment middle cerebral artery aneurysms and 1 supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm were treated with 2 Pipeline embolization Shield devices after a compassionate use request was approved. At 3 weeks after the procedure, the patient experienced a minor ischemic stroke after having missed the prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy. At the 3-month follow-up examination, the patient was neurologically intact and all the aneurysms were occluded. Dual antiplatelet therapy was discontinued.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flow diverters with surface modification to decrease thrombogenicity and accelerate aneurysm occlusion are promising endovascular tools for patients at high risk of complications with dual antiplatelet therapy. The present case represents one of the first cases performed in the United States using such a device. Despite the favorable outcome in the present case, the question of whether such technology obviates the need for dual antiplatelet therapy remains to be determined.

ID TARLOV CYSTS; PSEUDOTUMOR CEREBRI
AB OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension refers to cases of intracranial hypertension and normal brain parenchyma without ventriculomegaly or any kind of mass lesion. Perineural cysts are cerebrospinal fluid-filled cysts that usually arise from nerve roots near the dorsal ganglia. Often asymptomatic, they rarely cause mass effect symptoms. The association of these conditions is discussed herein.
   METHODS: We describe 2 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and symptomatic sacral perineural cysts. In both cases the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension ameliorated the sacral perineural cyst symptoms, and in 1 case we observed shrinking of the sacral perineural cysts.
   RESULTS: On the basis of this review, it is impossible to conclude whether there is an association between idiopathic intracranial hypertension and symptomatic perineural cysts. However, as an initial observation, this report can reveal a possible association.
   CONCLUSIONS: In some instances, idiopathic intracranial hypertension can associated with symptomatic sacral perineural cysts. In this clinical scenario, the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension may improve pertneural cyst symptoms.

   Cases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Hemangioma; Pediatric; Skull; Venous malformation
ID CAVERNOUS HEMANGIOMA; INTRAOSSEOUS HEMANGIOMA; CHILD
AB BACKGROUND: Intraosseous hemangioma is a rare bone tumor, accounting for 0.7%-1.0% of all bone tumors. It can occur at any age, but only 9% of cases are younger than 10 years old, Although this tumor is usually slow-growing and clinically silent, we experienced 2 pediatric patients undergoing surgery for skull hemangioma who presented with uncommon clinical manifestations.
   CASE DECRIPTION: Case 1 was a 9-year-old boy who presented with sudden -et of headache and was referred to our hospital. Radiologic images revealed an osteolytic oval lesion in the right parietal bone and acute subdural hemorrhage in the right cerebral hemisphere. The right parietal lesion was removed surgically. The lesion was found to have grown into the dura and to be adherent to the pia matter. The removed lesion was histologically confirmed to be a hemangioma. Case 2 was an 8-year-old girl who was referred to our hospital with an elastic mass that had been slowly enlarging for 7 years. Radiologic images revealed an osteolytic oval lesion in the right parietal bone. Surgical removal was thus planned. The lesion was found to be attached to the dura, and we removed the lesion with the surrounding bone and attached dura. Histologic examination confirmed the lesion to be a hemangioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although skull hemangiomas show clinical heterogeneity, removal is usually diagnostic and leads to good patient outcomes. On occasion, however, this tumor causes secondary changes in the dura, such that dural incision and dural plasty should be planned in advance of lesion removal.

ID AUTOSOMAL-RECESSIVE OSTEOPETROSIS; HYDROCEPHALUS; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Osteopetrosis (OP) is a varied clinical condition caused by malfunction or insufficient development of osteoclasts, or both. Neurologic findings can occur because of osteopetrotic conditions restricting neural foramina through which the spinal cord, cranial nerves, or major vascular structures traverse the skull. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a well-documented condition with OP. However, Chiari I malformation is rarely reported concomitantly with OP.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a patient with a known RTA who was witn a rapid progressive tetraparesis within 24 hours. Clinical and radiologic evaluation of the patient revealed OP with RTA together with Chiari I malformation and holocord hydromyelia. Management of the patient was started with correction of severe hypokalemia (K: 1.4 mEq/L), which resulted in dramatic improvement in tetraparesis. Two days later, a posterior fossa bone decompression with ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement during the same session led to prominent decrease in size of the ventricles and the hydromyelia on long-term follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OP can exhibit many clinical conditions. lever, our case involved an unusual and rapid progressive tetraparesis, which could confuse the management as necessitating an emergent posterior fossa decompression. Stabilizing the metabolic status of the patient facilitated elective surgery, which further improved patient's neurologic findings and diminished hydromyelia on long-term follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: Extended margin tumor resection beyond the abnormal area detected by magnetic resonance imaging, defined as supratotal resection, could improve the outcomes of patients with lower grade gliomas (LGGs). The aim of the present study was to assess the surgical outcomes of awake brain mapping to achieve supratotal resection with determination of the normal brain tissue boundaries beyond the tumor of frontal LGGs, in both dominant and nondominant hemispheres.
   METHODS: We analyzed the data from 9 patients with diffuse trontal LGGs who had undergone supratotal resection with awake surgery from January 2016 to November 2017.
   RESULTS: The frontal aslant tract was identified as the functional boundary in 4 of 5 left frontal tumor cases (80%). Working memory impairments during dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation with digit span and/or visual N-back tasks were detected in all 4 patients (100%) with right-frontal tumor. The neurocognitive outcomes were significantly improved after surgery, as shown by the mean Wechsler adult intelligence scale III scores for verbal intelligence quotient (P = 0.04) and verbal comprehension (P = 0.03) and the mean Wechsler memory scale-revised scores for generalized memory (P = 0.04) and delayed recall (P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have provided evidence that awake mapping can enable the preservation of higher neurocognitive function, including working memory and spatial cognition in patients with nondominant right frontal tumors. Despite the small number of cases, our findings suggest the surgical benefit of awake surgery for supratotal resection of diffuse frontal LGGs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Osteotomy through anterior exposure is challenging with severe complications for upper cervical kyphosis (CK), especially for cases with previous anterior fusion, A novel technique comprising 1-stage osteotomy via a posterolateral-only approach is introduced for treatment of CK secondary to C2-4 laminectomy for neurofibroma removal and subsequent anterior fusion.
   METHODS: A 42-year-old man presented with progressive numbness and weakness of upper and lower limbs. As an adolescent, he underwent posterior laminectomy and neurofibroma excision without effective fixation and anterior C2-4 vertebra fusion 6 years later. Sagittal computed tomography indicated that Cobb angle between C2 and C6 was 68 degrees with complete fusion between C2 and C4 vertebral bodies. Secondary CK was diagnosed based on medical history and radiographic findings, and modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale score was 10. Piezosurgery was used for osteotomy by shortening the vertebral height through posterolateral approach after cervical pedicle screw placement. Occipitocervical fusion was performed with compression between C2 and C4.
   RESULTS: Cobb angle was adjusted to 8 degrees post-operatively. Modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score increased to 14 with obvious muscle strength improvement. The 6-month postoperative x-ray indicated good position of C2-4 vertebrae and occipitocervical fixation system. No neurologic complications or local recurrence was found at final follow-up at 8 months. The patient returned to work in his full capacity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary outcomes reveal wedge osteotomy via piezosurgery through a posterolateral-only approach is feasible and effective in revision surgery for upper CK with previous anterior fusion.

   Optical frequency domain imaging; Restenosis
ID VASA VASORUM; ARTERY; IMPLANTATION
AB BACKGROUND: Neovascularization (NV) plays an important role in plaque progression and plaque vulnerability. However, visualization of NV is difficult using standard imaging tools. Recently, optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) has provided images of intraplaque microstructure that could not be visualized by previous imaging modalities. Here we report a rare case of NV in the carotid plaque detected both before carotid artery stenting (CAS) and in an in-stent restenotic lesion using OFDI.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 71-year-old man with asymptomatic severe left Carotid artery stenosis was scheduled for CAS. The degree of stenosis had progressed during short-term follow-up. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging suggested vulnerable plaque. We performed OFDI to evaluate plaque morphology before and after the CAS procedure. Before CAS, OFDI revealed multiple NVs in the carotid plaque, localized around the most stenotic lesion. After CAS, OFDI showed good apposition of the stent to the vascular wall. At 5 months after CAS, in-stent restenosis was detected, which was treated by CAS. Before CAS of the restenotic lesion, OFDI revealed multiple NVs in the restenotic lesion inside the stent struts. After stenting, no ischemic lesions were detected, and restenosis did not occur again over the 1-year follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: In carotid artery plaque, NV might correlate with plaque progression and in-stent restenosis. OFDI enables advanced evaluation of NVs in the carotid artery plaque.

After completion of guideline-concordant chemoradiation, he chose to undergo TTF therapy. Because of the absence of cardiac symptoms and the theoretical risk of far-field sensing by the pacemaker of the TTF device (potentially resulting in pacemaker inhibition), the pacemaker was turned off before receiving TTF. Following TTF implementation, the patient responded well; he remains alive more than 25 months following his GBM diagnosis, exceeding the median 20.9-month survival of the recently completed phase Ill TTF randomized clinical trial for newly diagnosed GBM. Furthermore, he has exhibited neither cardiac morbidity nor adverse scalp reactions to TTF therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: The first reported case of successful TTF administration in a GBM patient with a previously implanted cardiac pacemaker may allay the concerns of neuro-oncologists, cardiologists, radiation oncologists, and all certified TTF prescribers regarding the applicability of TTF in suitable candidates with preexisting cardiac pacemakers. This case indicates that TTF therapy may be efficacious in patients with indwelling magnetic resonance image-conditional cardiac pacemakers turned to the off position and that physical removal of the pacemaker is not necessary before starting TTF.

AB In this review, we examine the portrayal of neurosurgery and neurosurgeons in 61 movies produced from the beginnings of cinema from the Lumiere brothers (1895) to 2017, across 4 continents and covering 10 cinematic genres. We find that these movies tend to shape most beliefs and stereotypes about neurosurgery. However, we notice that there is a trend to describe neurosurgery and neurosurgical disorders with more accuracy as we progress in time. Although it is not for the medical profession to dictate or censor fictional content, a keen eye on these depictions will help us to understand, and perhaps combat, some of the stereotypes and myths that continue to surround neurosurgery in the twenty-first century.

AB OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound volume navigation (UVN) has been widely used for accurate guidance and decreased radiation exposure. However, few studies have focused on the clinical significance of UVN in guiding percutaneous puncture in percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). We evaluated UVN to guide percutaneous puncture in PTED.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 12 patients (8 men and 4 women), who had undergone PTED with the help of UVN or fluoroscopic guidance for lumbar disc herniation from November 2017 to December 2017.
   RESULTS: The age of these 12 patients range was 26-71 years, and the body mass index range was 18.19-26.91 kg/m(2). Of the 12 patients, 6 were in UVN group and 6 were in fluoroscopy group. The mean number of punctures was 1.00 in UVN group and 3.83 in fluoroscopy group. The mean exposure time was 3.60 and 13.80 seconds in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. The mean operation time was 48.17 minutes and 61.33 minutes in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. A positive relationship was found between operation time and exposure time (P < 0.05). All patients achieved excellent or good clinical outcomes. The Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scales for leg pain and back pain all showed significant improvement after the procedure (P < 0.05). None of patients experienced a complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: UVN decreased the number of puncture attempts, radiation exposure, and operation time compared with fluoroscopic guidance in PTED. Therefore, UVN is a feasible and efficient method for guiding percutaneous puncture in PTED.

LA English
DT Article
DE Arterial dissection; Dissecting aneurysm; Fusiform aneurysm;
   Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID INTERNAL CAROTID-ARTERY; INTRACRANIAL FUSIFORM; MECHANISM; SEGMENT; WALL
AB BACKGROUND: Blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) are an uncommon group of arterial aneurysms with a high risk of rupture, progression, and repeat rupture. The best intervention is unclear; however, their clinical behavior typically requires urgent intervention. We describe a BBA managed conservatively with complete resolution found at follow-up.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old woman presented with a Hunt-Hess grade 2, Fisher grade 3 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Computed tomography (CT) revealed mild hydrocephalus with a thick basal SAH that was eccentric to the left. The findings from CT angiography were negative. Digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) revealed a focal protuberance along the dorsal surface of the left ophthalmic segment that was concerning for a dorsal variant BBA. Repeat angiography 48 hours later demonstrated receding of the ectasia, with replacement by a <1-mm defect resembling a dorsal vessel surface fenestration. DSA 7 days after her presentation showed further healing. At 6 weeks, DSA showed no residual abnormality.
   CONCLUSIONS: DSA remains an important imaging study for the detection of small aneurysms, because CT angiography might not have sufficient resolution. Our unique case provides strong evidence that BBAs represent a parent artery focal dissection. BBAs can remodel over time, usually with enlargement and repeat rupture if untreated. It is possible, as we have demonstrated, that some small lesions presenting with SAH might spontaneously heal without intervention.

LA English
DT Article
DE Denosumab; Giant cell tumors; Skull base
ID SPHENOID BONE; DENOSUMAB
AB BACKGROUND: Giant cell tumors (GCTs) are benign tumors with a predilection for the epimetaphyseal region of the long bones. GCTs involving the skull base are rare, and only a few available cases have been reported. Surgical gross total resection is the recommended method of treatment for GCTs. In the case of skull base tumors, it is very difficult to achieve such a result by direct surgical resection alone without any morbidities. Denosumab is a fully humanized monoclonal anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand antibody that has been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of GCTs that are surgically unresectable, metastatic, and have a high risk of progression and recurrence. Denosumab has been used in many cases involving the long bones. However, in cases of skull base GCTs, only a limited number of cases have been reported. In addition, in such cases, it was used as postoperative chemotherapy owing to subtotal resection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: For the present patient, we adopted a unique approach in which denosumab was administered as neoadjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the size of the tumor to a resectable level. Subsequently, surgical resection was performed with good functional and histopathological outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the use of denosumab as a neoadjuvant treatment routinely for all cases of skull base GCTs to achieve safe and complete excision of the tumor.

ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; INTRACRANIAL MENINGIOMA; FORAMEN; FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic meningiomas, although relatively uncommon, represent a distinct clinical entity. In some cases, these meningiomas can closely mimic a thrombosed aneurysm. We present a case of a jugular tubercle meningioma whose radiographic and clinical picture initially suggested a ruptured, thrombosed vertebrobasilar aneurysm. This case serves to highlight several key differences between these 2 pathologies that can assist in diagnosis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old woman presented to an outside hospital with a severe, sudden onset headache along with new-onset horizontal diplopia. On examination, she was noted to have a left sixth nerve palsy. A computerized tomography scan was performed and demonstrated a mass in the region of the left jugular foramen. A subsequent lumbar puncture was suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Frozen section was suggestive of meningioma and our patient underwent a successful gross total resection with no permanent neurological sequelae.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic meningiomas can have a clinical and radiologic picture that closely resembles a ruptured, thrombosed cerebral aneurysm. Based on our single case, we suggest several important diagnostic differentiators between these 2 entities. We found the hemorrhagic meningioma to exhibit eggshell-like rim calcification, thick, irregular peripheral enhancement, and a central cystic component. This can be contrasted to the classic appearance of a thrombosed aneurysm with mixed T-1-, T-2-weighted signal intensity, and occasional regular, thin peripheral enhancement.

AB OBJECTIVE: We have described the use of 3-dimensional (3D) virtual planning and 3D printed patient-specific osteotomy templates in the surgical correction of a complex spinal deformity. Pedicle subtraction osteotomies (PSOs) for the correction of severe spinal deformities are technically demanding procedures with a risk of major complications. In particular, operations of the severely deformed spine call for new, more precise, methods of surgical planning. The new 3D technology could result in new possibilities for the surgical planning of spinal deformities.
   METHODS: We present the case of severe congenital kyphoscoliosis in a young girl with skeletal dysplasia. A closing wedge-extended PSO was 3D virtual planned using medical computer design software. After the optimal 3D-wedge procedure was planned, individualized osteotomy-guiding templates were designed for translation of the planned PSO to the surgical procedure. During surgery, the PSO was performed using the osteotomy templates. Successful correction of the kyphoscoliosis was realized.
   RESULTS: The kyphosis was successfully reduced using a wedge-shaped extended PSO using preoperative 3D virtual planning, assisted by 3D-printed individualized osteotomy-guiding templates.
   CONCLUSIONS: In addition to direct translation of the planned PSO for surgery, the 3D planning also facilitated a detailed preoperative evaluation, greater insight into the case-specific anatomy, and accurate planning of the required correction.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cervical spinal cord stimulation is a safe and effective treatment for chronic axial neck pain and upper limb neuropathic pain. We report our novel institutional experience with performing cervical spinal cord stimulation trials with patients placed in an upright sitting position. This allows easy access to the cervical epidural space and has the added benefit of unobstructed access to the airway.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data for patients who had undergone cervical spinal cord stimulation trial procedures in an upright, sitting position at the Van-derbilt University Medical Center. Demographic information including age, gender, preoperative diagnosis, progression to permanent implant after a successful trial, and operative time in minutes was collected.
   RESULTS: A detailed description of the technique for implantation of cervical spinal cord stimulator trial leads in an upright sitting position is described. A total of 29 patients were implanted; 16 (55%) were female. Mean operative time was 78 minutes from incision to closing. The majority of patients (25/29; 86%) had successful trials and proceeded to permanent implant. No complications occurred, and the procedure was well tolerated by all patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cervical spinal cord stimulation trials performed in an upright, sitting position allow for easy epidural access and an unobstructed airway with reasonable setup time.

AB BACKGROUND: We presented 3 cases of transient cortical blindness secondary to contrast medium toxicity after endovascular procedures for intracranial aneurysms. We also reviewed the literature and found 12 cases of contrast-induced cortical blindness after endovascular procedures for intracranial aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients (cases 1 and 2) noted bilateral blindness 5 and 6 hours, respectively, after awakening from general anesthesia following aneurysm treatment. The third patient (case 3) noted bilateral blindness during vertebral angiography under local anesthesia. Immediate angiography was performed in case 1 and showed no arterial occlusion. Computed tomography was performed in case 2 and showed brain edema. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in all 3 cases, and cases 2 and 3 showed abnormal presentation on fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences. With the use of corticosteroid and intravenous hydration, cortical blindness resolved within 1 week in 2 patients (Cases 1 and 2). The remaining patient (case 3) had incomplete quadrantanopia 3 months after blindness onset.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience and the literature reports, we advocate corticosteroid and intravenous hydration for patients with contrast-induced cortical blindness after endovascular procedures for intracranial aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors. The current diagnosis and treatment of meningioma is dependent on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, with follow-up management relying mainly on magnetic resonance imaging. The limitations of these structural imaging modalities include delineation of the tumor extent, tumor grade, and differentiation from other meningioma mimickers, especially in or around the skull base. Because studies with positron emission tomography (PET) have shown that PET is able to fulfill some of these gaps, the use of PET for meningiomas has been steadily increasing. Fluciclovine, also known as anti-1-amino-3-[F-18]-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (Axumin), is a new PET radiotracer approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2016 for the detection of suspected recurrent prostate cancer with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. Because the radiotracer is new, very little is known about the utility of this tracer in brain tumors.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present 3 cases of meningioma with avid uptake of fluciclovine. In each of these cases, the meningioma was incidentally found during surveillance using PET imaging in patients with prostate cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS: These cases illustrate that this new radiotracer has the potential to be a complementary tool in the meningioma workup, treatment, and follow-up, especially for skull base lesions.

TI Rupture of Giant Anterior Sacral Meningocele in a Patient with Marfan
   Syndrome: Diagnosis and Management
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anterior sacral meningocele; Dural ectasia; Management; Marfan syndrome;
   Rupture
ID DURAL ECTASIA; RETENTION
AB BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that results in the weakening of connective tissues. Dural ectasia has been defined as a feature of Marfan syndrome and is present in up to 92% of patients. Rarely, dural ectasia can erode through the sacrum expanding into an anterior sacral meningocele.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Information for this case report was gathered from patient notes and imaging from the patient chart. This is a case of a 46-year-old woman who presented with urinary incontinence, early satiety, and back pain in the setting of a known anterior sacral meningocele. Before operative management, the anterior sacral meningocele ruptured with the patient presenting signs and symptoms of intracranial hypotension. Conservative management did not alleviate the pain. She was ultimately managed with posterior sacroplasty followed by anterior sacral meningocele resection and placement of a lumboperitoneal shunt. The patient did not have reaccumulation of the meningocele or recurrent symptoms at the latest follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The progression of dural ectasia in Marfan syndrome to an anterior sacral meningocele is uncommon. It is important to identify the characteristics associated with an expanding dural ectasia as this patient's symptoms progressed over time and the meningocele grew large. Given its rarity, there are no guidelines in place regarding size at which repair of an anterior sacral meningocele should occur prophylactically. It is important to review these cases in order continue to learn about progression, management, and outcomes of patients with an anterior sacral meningocele.

TI Microvascular Decompression for Oculomotor Nerve Palsy Due to

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Infundibular dilatation of posterior communicating artery; Microvascular
   decompression; Oculomotor nerve palsy
ID ANEURYSMS; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Oculomotor nerve palsy is occasionally a key indicator of an internal carotid posterior communicating (ICPC) artery bifurcation aneurysm. The interval between the onset of palsy and the time of surgery is considered to be the most important factor affecting recovery from oculomotor nerve palsy. We encountered a rare case of oculomotor nerve palsy due to compression by the infundibular dilatation of the posterior communicating artery (PcomA) rather than by an ICPC aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 70-year-old woman who presented with pain in the left forehead and left oculomotor nerve palsy with a prominence at the bifurcation of the left internal carotid artery and PcomA on neuroradiologic imaging, indicating a small aneurysm. However, the positional relationship between the bulging lesion and PcomA was not apparent. The intraoperative microscopic view showed that the lesion was an infundibular dilatation of the PcomA rather than an aneurysm, compressing the oculomotor nerve. Microvascular decompression of the lesion resulted in the disappearance of her symptoms after 3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of a symptomatic ICPC unruptured aneurysm, direct observation by open surgery is important when the relationship between the PcomA and aneurysm is not clear by neuroradiologic imaging.

   Esophageal perforation
ID PERFORATION
AB BACKGROUND: We illustrate the case of an unstable fracture of the cervical spine in ankylosing spondylitis with associated esophageal injury after minor trauma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old man fell backwards from the first rung of a ladder, sustaining a transverse fracture of the C6 vertebral body and a new diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. He was taken for surgical fixation; however, his esophagus was discovered entrapped within the fracture at the time of surgery. Despite the severity of the injury, with surgical reduction, fixation, and esophageal exclusion this patient made a full recovery.
   CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the severity of injury after minor trauma in the context of ankylosing spondylitis, the capacity for full recovery in esophageal perforations in spinal trauma, and that clinical suspicion of such injuries allows early diagnosis, treatment, and reduced complications.

   EXCISION; OUTCOMES; SURGERY; REMOVAL; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Dumbbell-shaped schwannomas involving the spinal canal, the intervertebral foramen, and the thoracic cavity are rare lesions. Surgical treatment represents a challenge, and there is no consensus regarding ideal management. Two major surgical routes have been used: combined laminectomy and open thoracotomy or posterolateral extrapleural approach with wide bone removal. This report describes a relatively easy surgical strategy, combined laminectomy and thoracoscopy, which allows safe resection under an adequate view with low risk of spinal instability, pain, or respiratory problems.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old man presented with rapidly progressing motor impairment caused by a dumbbell-shaped, 65-mm, Eden type III lesion at the T5 level. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an intraspinal-extradural mass extending into the chest cavity and causing severe spinal cord compression. The patient underwent single-stage surgery performed by a neurosurgical and thoracic team. The extradural and foraminal tumor components were first removed through a 1-level laminectomy with foraminotomy and without facetectomy. Subsequently, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed to approach the anterior paraspinal component. Total tumor removal, confirmed with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, was achieved. Pathologic diagnosis was schwannoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient's neurologic deficits resolved, and he experienced minimal pain after the operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: A single-stage operation using combined laminectomy and video-assisted thoracic surgery is a safe and efficacious strategy for achieving total removal of dumbbell-shaped thoracic schwannomas, even in cases involving giant lesions and elderly patients.

ID MALFORMATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Developmental venous anomaly (DVA) or venous angioma is a common anomaly of cerebral veins that is found incidentally in the majority of cases. There are few cases of arteriovenous shunting in DVA associated with a more malignant course of the disease. Whether these DVAs with shunts are of congenital pathology or lifetime formations is unclear.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of lifetime arteriovenous shunt formation in DVA that caused intracerebral hemorrhage in a child. The patient underwent 2 sequential direct surgeries: an emergency evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma and a scheduled excision of the DVA with arteriovenous shunting.
   CONCLUSIONS: Arteriovenous shunting in DVA may develop during a lifetime and cause intracerebral hemorrhages. This case showed that localization of DVA with arteriovenous shunting in a noneloquent area enables its complete microsurgical excision with favorable functional outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Myelocystoceles, which are classified as closed neural tube defects, are usually covered by skin and rarely complicated by hydrocephalus. We encountered an unusual case of a terminal myelocystocele with hydrocephalus with clinical characteristics of a myelomeningocele.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Severe hydrocephalus and a lumbosacral lesion were detected in the fetus of a gravid 34-year-old woman. Cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks. The neonate presented with a lumbosacral mass with a partial skin defect. As myelomeningocele was suspected, the neonate underwent surgery on the day of birth. The intraoperative findings pointed to a myelocystocele rather than a myelomeningocele. After insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the neonate was discharged without any neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Presence of skin abnormalities, hydrocephalus, and lumbosacral mass strongly suggests a diagnosis of myelomeningocele. However, such cases should be differentiated from myelocystocele, especially when associated with severe hydrocephalus.

AB OBJECTIVE: The transtentorial extension of the retrosigmoid approach allows for improved visualization of the brainstem and petroclival region. This approach is an important tool in the skull base surgeon's armamentarium for pathologies involving the petroclival region. It has been shown that the addition of tentorial transection improves the exposed surface area of the brainstem. However, no data have been reported regarding the depth of the additional anterior and medial exposure. The goal of the present study was to describe the additional depth of exposure gained by performing tentorial transection. This information allows surgeons to preoperatively estimate the amount of operative exposure gained by this technique.
   METHODS: Five preserved cadaveric heads were dissected using frameless image guidance. A standard retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed, followed by tentorial transection. The boundaries of the surgical exposure and depth of the surgical field were compared before and after tentorial transection.
   RESULTS: After transection, we found a 20.1-mm increase in anterior exposure (P < 0.01) and a 13-mm increase in medial exposure (P< 0.01). No significant difference was found in the extent of the superior (P = 0.32) or lateral (P = 0.07) exposure. The surgical working distance increased significantly from 68.8 to 90.3 mm (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: When performing retrosigmoid addition of tentorial transection allows for a significant increase in anterior and medial exposure with no significant increase in superior or lateral exposure.

AB BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare primary or secondary inflammatory disorder that manifests with thickening of dura mater involving predominantly the tentorium and falx in the focal form. Hydrocephalus has not been reported in association with secondary HP.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 61-year-old woman presented with intracranial HP of the posterior fossa secondary to Wegener granulomatosis not responsive to corticosteroid therapy. Owing to the association of noncommunicating hydrocephalus, endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed. There was immediate improvement of neurologic symptoms and no postoperative complications. The patient had very good clinical and radiologic outcome at 1-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: In a case of noncommunicating hydrocephalus related to focal HP of the posterior fossa, endoscopic third ventriculostomy was effective in resolving symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure. The physiopathogenetic mechanisms and therapeutic strategies were discussed along with a review of the most relevant literature.

AB BACKGROUND: Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disorder that primarily presents as multiple cutaneous lesions in young males. Solitary lesions in the spinal column are an especially rare presentation of this disease, and central nervous system involvement can portend a poor prognosis. We report an unusual case of an adult woman with an unresectable JXG of the lumbar spine. A review of the reported cases of thoracolumbar JXG and the current data regarding diagnosis and treatment are presented.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 28-year-old woman presented with back pain and worsening lower extremity pain, numbness, and weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an enhancing lumbar mass. However, at surgery, no discrete mass was identified. Multiple roots were grossly enlarged, and electrical stimulation identified the L4 root with the most abnormal findings. Despite an attempt at debulking, most of the mass could not be safely removed. The patient experienced incomplete improvement of the symptoms postoperatively but elected to forgo chemotherapy. The 3-month follow-up imaging study showed active lumbar spinal disease, and imaging and follow-up examinations at 27 months revealed no changes. Her symptoms were satisfactorily controlled with conservative therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: JXG of the spine is a rare disease with nonspecific clinical and radiographic findings that can make it difficult to diagnose and dictates the use of immunohistochemical staining. If possible, total surgical resection will offer the best outcomes; however, other modalities such as chemotherapy can be viable alternatives or adjuvant modalities.

ID PITUITARY-TUMORS; CUSHINGS-DISEASE; CARCINOMA; TEMOZOLOMIDE
AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary adenomas are one of the most common tumors of adulthood; however, subtypes such as Crooke cell adenoma are relatively rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 55-year-old woman who presented with new-onset intermittent headache and dizziness. Clinical and laboratory investigations were not suggestive of corticotroph tumor. However, subsequent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed the presence of a suprasellar pituitary adenoma displacing the optic chiasma superiorly, with hemorrhage and sellar expansion. The lesion was removed by transsphenoidal surgery and the biopsy confirmed the lesion to be a nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma. Further investigation revealed that the specimen demonstrated Crooke hyaline changes, with strong immunoreactivity for adrenocorticotropic hormone. However, initial workup and postoperative testing lacked evidence of Cushing disease. There was no sign of recurrence after 1-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinically silent Crooke cell adenomas are rare occurrences, and as such we report this case with investigation of past cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension are rare signs of spinal tumors when presenting in isolation, particularly with benign tumors.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein reported is a case of a 53-year-old woman who presented with headache, blurry vision, communicating hydrocephalus, and intracranial hypertension. No primary intracranial pathology was identified, and there were no clinical signs or symptoms of intraspinal pathology. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated opening pressure, cerebrospinal fluid protein, and suspected tumor cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, thus prompting spinal imaging. A primary lumbar schwannoma was subsequently determined to underlie her symptoms, which resolved with tumor resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinical suspicion of spinal pathology should be maintained in patients with unexplained Intracranial hypertension, even in the absence of localizing signs of spinal pathology.

AB BACKGROUND: Sellar infections represent less than 1% of all sellar lesions and can be life-threatening. These infections occur de novo in up to 70% of patients or can less commonly develop after surgical treatment of another primary lesion, such as a pituitary adenoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a unique case of a 27-year-old woman with a recurrent pituitary adenoma treated with 2 previous transsphenoidal resections. She ultimately presented with hypopituitarism, followed by headaches, malaise, chills, and visual-field and acuity deficits 9 years after her second transsphenoidal resection. During the second operation, the sellar floor was reconstructed with hydroxyapatite bone cement. On the most recent presentation, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and pituitary demonstrated a residual sellar mass accompanied by significant enhancement and T2 hyperintensity of the infundibulum, hypothalamus, optic chiasm, and optic tracts. The patient was started on empiric antibiotics and steroids before frank purulence in the sella was discovered and removed by transsphenoidal endoscopy. Cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. At her 3-month follow-up evaluation, the patient had complete resolution of her symptoms and radiographic findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the fact that patients with pituitary lesions who have foreign material used for surgical closure can present with infections many years after the initial intervention. Furthermore, with appropriate clinical diagnosis and treatment, the reactive inflammation caused by sellar infection is reversible. We review the literature regarding the risk factors and management strategies for delayed postoperative sellar infections.

AB OBJECTIVE: We present an illustrative case of pediatric intracranial anaplastic ganglioglioma and systematically reviewed the current reported data of anaplastic ganglioglioma in the pediatric population.
   METHODS: A comprehensive literature search for our review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and Embase databases. The search terms included "ganglioglioma," "anaplastic," "pediatrics," "children," and "intracranial." We used no limitations for date, type, or language. Reports of pediatric patients (age <19 years) with intracranial anaplastic gangliogliomas were included. Baseline patient demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, imaging characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes data were extracted.
   RESULTS: We included 24 studies involving 34 patients in the quantitative synthesis. The mean patient age was 9.18 +/- 5.46 years (range, 0.16-18). A male predominance was observed (approximate male/female ratio, 1.61:1). Increased intracranial pressure was the most common symptom (n = 19; 55%), followed by seizures (n = 11; 32%). These tumors were most often found in the supratentorial compartment (n = 26; 76%). All 34 patients had undergone surgical removal. The mean follow-up was 22.2 months (range, 2-72). The mean overall survival duration was 43 months (95% confidence interval, 32.45%-55.31%; 1- and 3-year overall survival, 76.6% and 45.5%, respectively). The median event-free survival was 34 months (95% confidence interval, 10.6% -57.3%; 1- and 3-year event-free survival rate, 76.6% and 42.4%, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to our understanding of the characteristics of this rare malignant tumor and show that anaplastic ganglioglioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intracranial tumors in pediatric patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) is a rare, malignant tumor occurring more commonly in children than adults. This case report describes the clinical course of a 3-year-old boy with a rare case of metastatic CPC with a novel TP53 mutation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 3-year-old boy presented with postconcussive symptoms after a fall. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed lesions in the suprasellar cistern, left lateral ventricle, and cauda equina. The tumor was diagnosed as choroid plexus carcinoma with a novel TP53 V216M somatic mutation. The patient underwent resection of the left lateral ventricle lesion.
   CONCLUSION: We describe a case of CPC with highly metastatic characteristics and a novel TP53 mutation. Our report implicates TP53 in the pathogenesis of pediatric CPC, and we emphasize that CPC in children should prompt careful consideration of TP53 status to inform prognosis and clinical treatment.

ID RISK-FACTORS; DISEASE; DSA
AB BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered angiography non-contrast-enhanced (TRANCE) imaging is useful for investigating peripheral vessel diseases; however, its efficacy for access route assessment in cerebral angiography has yet to be reported. Therefore we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TRANCE imaging in the assessment of the access route before diagnostic subtraction angiography for cerebral vascular disorders.
   METHODS: TRANCE imaging was performed in all patients undergoing catheter angiography for disease diagnosis at our institute between April 2014 and March 2015. This study included 31 patients (14 men, 17 women) and investigated potential changes in the planned puncture site before and during the procedure (including the reason for the change) as our main outcome.
   RESULTS: TRANCE was successfully conducted in all of patients recruited. TRANCE images led to an alteration in the approach vessel for 5 cases. The mean procedure time for angiography was <60 minutes. The median total number of catheters and guidewires used during catheter angiography was 1 (range: 1-3) and 1 (range: 1-2), respectively. There were no catheter angiography-related complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: TRANCE imaging before diagnostic angiography useful because it allows detailed assessment of the access route. This practice may reduce procedure time, thus resulting in fewer complications.

AB Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor has recently been included in the World Health Organization classification as a low-grade tumor. It usually occurs in young adults, arising from the fourth ventricular region. The authors describe a rare case of rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor arising from the spinal cord with cerebrospinal fluid dissemination. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cervical spinal cord tumor, which could be easily misdiagnosed as ependyma or astrocytoma.
   Surgical total resection was performed, and histopathologic examination made the diagnosis, showing a biphasic neurocytic and glial tumor with neurocytic rosettes. Six months after surgery, the patient had fully recovered.

AB BACKGROUND: Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), also called sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is an idiopathic, non-neoplastic, lymphoproliferative disorder. Histologically, the disease is characterized by emperipolesis and S-100 immunoreactivity. RDD usually presents with massive painless cervical lymphadenopathy, with only 5% of cases affecting the central nervous system.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 46-year-old woman with isolated RDD of the left cavernous sinus with left facial numbness and weakness of the left masticatory muscle. The patient was successfully treated by total resection without recurrence found at the 65-month follow-up examination.
   CONCLUSIONS: Central nervous system RDD is a diagnostic challenge pre-operatively depending on the radiologic findings. Immunohistochemical confirmation is indispensable for the definite diagnosis. Total resection remains the most effective treatment to date. Adjuvant treatment such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and steroids can be administrated in cases of incomplete resection, recurrence, or multiple foci.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Aneurysm; Clipping; Posterior communicating artery; Unilateral
AB This video (Video 1) demonstrates bilateral posterior communicating artery (PCoA) aneurysms that were treated through a unilateral supraorbital approach. A 53-year-old woman presented with a Hunt-Hess grade I subarachnoid hemorrhage. Computed tomography scan showed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left sylvian fissure and basal cistern. Angiography demonstrated bilateral aneurysms of the PCoA. Considering posteromedial projection of the contralateral aneurysm, a unilateral approach from the side of the ruptured aneurysm was chosen to clip bilateral aneurysms. The patient was positioned supine, and the aneurysm was exposed via the left lateral supraorbital approach. We firstly opened the chiasmatic cistern and left carotid cistern, followed by the proximal part of the sylvian fissure. Coagulation of the dura covering the anterior clinoid process and partial clinoidectomy were performed to expose the proximal aneurysm neck. The anterior choroid artery was separated from the distal aneurysm neck. The aneurysm was clipped with a simple straight clip. The interoptic space and contralateral optic carotid space were further dissected to expose the contralateral carotid artery, PCoA, anterior choroid artery, and neck of the aneurysm. A fenestrated clip was used to occlude the aneurysm with preservation of these critical vessels. The patient recovered well without any complications.

TI Extending Endovascular Embolization to Type A Spinal Perimedullary
   Arteriovenous Fistula Using Liquid Embolic Agent: Technical Nuances,
   Challenges and Initial Outcome
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Liquid embolic device; Type A PMAVF embolization
ID CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS; CORD; ONYX; MANAGEMENT; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: The definitive treatment of perimedullary arteriovenous fistulas (PMAVFs) is warranted in view of the progressive neurologic decline noted with the conservative mode of management. The treatment options include microsurgical excision, endovascular embolization, or a multimodal approach. Because of the relatively larger size of the feeding arteries in type B and C PMAVFs, an endovascular approach is usually feasible. However, the endovascular treatment for type A lesions is technically challenging in view of near normal sized arterial feeders. Endovascular embolization using n-butyl cyanoacrylate is described; however, successful use of liquid embolic agents such as onyx or squid is not previously documented.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The described 3 cases initially presented with insidious onset and gradually progressive paraparesis, paresthesia, and urinary symptoms. The imaging (magnetic resonance and digital subtraction angiography) revealed type A PMAVFs. The microcatheter could be successfully navigated close to the fistulous site, and complete obliteration of the fistula was achieved using ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH)-based liquid embolic agent, squid in all of our cases. The occlusion remained durable, and patients showed steady neurologic improvement in the follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular embolization of type A PMAVF using EVOH-based liquid embolic agent is feasible and could be considered as an effective alternative to surgery.

TI Growth of Thrombosed Cerebral Venous Varix Following Resection of
   Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation: Case Report with Pathologic
   Consideration
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Arteriovenous malformation; Brain edema; Foreign body; Onyx; Thrombosis;
   Venous varix
ID ANEURYSM
AB BACKGROUND: Varix of the drainage route can spontaneously develop thrombosis and disappear after the treatment of the associated cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). We report a rare case in which a thrombosed cerebral venous varix of the drainage route exhibited growth despite complete resection of the associated cerebral AVM.
   DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old man was diagnosed with an AVM in the left temporal lobe. The AVM was accompanied by a large venous varix in the superficial venous drainage route. Transarterial embolization was performed followed by resection of the nidus. The venous varix in the drainage route was not resected, as it was buried in the temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere. The venous varix was ligated using a titanium clip and nylon thread. Postoperative angiography confirmed the disappearance of the AVM, and magnetic resonance imaging showed thrombosis of the venous varix. However, follow-up magnetic resonance imaging performed 5 months after surgery showed the enlargement of the thrombosed venous varix and emergence of perilesional cerebral edema. The venous varix was excised by reoperation to prevent further growth. Histopathologic evaluation showed infiltration of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells and proliferation of capillaries vessels within the walls of the varix, particularly around the embolic and ligation materials.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the growth of a thrombosed cerebral venous varix after the resection of a cerebral AVM. The possible cause of this rare phenomenon is excessive inflammation with neovascularization within the wall of the venous varix during thrombogenesis, enhanced by reaction against embolic and ligation materials.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Intracranial aneurysm; Mechanical thrombectomy; Stroke
AB BACKGROUND: The hybrid operating room (OR) offers new opportunities for management of complex cerebrovascular lesions to the dual-trained neurovascular surgeon. It creates a space for easy accessibility to perform complex endovascular procedures by delivering high-quality images with readily available surgical equipment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we demonstrate how the hybrid OR allowed for identification and near zero-delay distal mechanical thrombectomy of a middle cerebral artery occlusion with favorable outcome after clipping of a complex posterior communicating artery aneurysm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative cerebral angiography after open surgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms gives real-time actionable data that can affect intraoperative decision making. This can be accomplished without a hybrid OR by using fluoroscopic equipment, but suboptimal imaging conditions may lead to unfavorable outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy can be associated with significant morbidity. Dural substitutes during the initial decompression could improve outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of online peer-reviewed databases to determine the effect of dural substitutes during decompressive craniectomy on operative metrics and outcomes after subsequent cranioplasty.
   RESULTS: Nine studies from 2006 to 2018 had reported the results from 922 patients undergoing autologous cranioplasty. Seven types of dural substitute were described, including biologic and synthetic materials. Compared with no graft, the use of dural substitutes was associated with significantly decreased operative times and surgical blood loss during subsequent cranioplasty. One study evaluated dual-layer substitutes and documented superior results compared with single layer. The most commonly reported complications were infection and cerebrospinal fluid leak; however, a significant reduction in complications was seen in only 1 study.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of dural substitutes was associated with superior operative metrics, complication rates, and long-term outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Candida parapsilosis is an incredibly rare cause of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt infections, with only 1 adult case reported in the literature to date.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 45-year-old man admitted for a traumatic fall and subsequently treated with VP shunt placement for obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a cerebellar contusion and intraventricular hemorrhage. Eight months following VP shunt placement, the patient presented with a 2-month history of clear fluid leakage through a dehiscent surgical abdominal wound overlying the distal VP shunt. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures were obtained and grew C. parapsilosis. The patient subsequently underwent VP shunt externalization and began antifungal treatment with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. Cerebrospinal fluid studies continued to redemonstrate C. parapsilosis infection, for which VP shunt removal and external ventricular drain placement was performed. Three days into treatment with amphotericin B, he endured significant nephrotoxicity necessitating a switch to oral fluconazole. Following 3 weeks of oral fluconazole treatment with negative serial cerebrospinal fluid cultures, the patient underwent external ventricular drain removal and VP shunt insertion. Following the procedure and 22 total days of oral fluconazole treatment, our patient recovered well and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in stable condition.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our report, we describe the clinical course of our patient and offer a review and analysis of the most up-to-date literature concerning C. parapsilosis shunt infections, as well as treatment guidelines for central nervous system candidiasis.

AB INTRODUCTION: Occipital-frontal nerve stimulation is an off-label therapy for treating chronic refractory migraine and orofacial pain. Though effective, patients experience a high rate of complications including lead migration and erosion through the overlying skin.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of frontal electrode erosion that was revised via pericranial flap repair. The patient presented with multiple lead migrations, necessitating multiple revision surgeries with eventual frontal wound dehiscence. The choice was made to wrap the electrode in a pericranial flap to prevent recurrent lead migration. Two weeks postoperatively, the wound was well healed and the patient reported that the midline electrode was functioning properly.
   DISCUSSION: Pericranial flap revision confers little additional risk when copared with simple wound closure, and the surgeon can proceed without total electrode removal, additional incisions, or lead tunneling. The flap provides a highly vascular additional layer of stability to the electrode, reducing the likelihood of further lead exposure without compromising the efficacy of the device. These results suggest that endoscopic pericranial flap revision is a viable technique for the repair of occipital nerve stimulation lead erosions.

DE Aneurysm; Basilar fenestration; Comaneci; Embolization; Temporary
   bridging device
ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Fenestration of the basilar artery is a segmental duplication of the vessel due to nonfusion of the embryonal arteries and is the second most common vascular disjunction. Here, we present a single case example demonstrating the utility of the temporary bridging device Comaneci as a new option in the endovascular treatment of ruptured basilar artery aneurysms associated with fenestrations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old female patient presented to our hospital with a 3-month history of frequent multiple sentinel severe headaches. At the time of hospitalization, the patient was neurologically intact with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. There was no evidence of focal neurologic deficits or cranial nerve lesions, but there was discrete neck stiffness and a diagnosed saccular aneurysm associated with a fenestration of the basilar artery. After multidisciplinary discussion involving neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists and taking into consideration the patient's clinical presentation and previous history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as the morphology of the posterior circulation aneurysm, endovascular treatment of the basilar fenestration aneurysm was deemed appropriate or simply use was chosen.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our case results are similar to previously published good results of endovascular coiling and add information regarding the relatively new Comaneci device, which helped to achieve considerable packing density of the aneurysmal sac. Using this device lowers the risk of peri- and postoperative complications. We believe that this technique is safer and better than the balloon-assisted and stent-assisted coiling in ruptured case scenarios of wideneck aneurysms in the posterior circulation.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Cranioplasty; Dead space; Infection; Obliteration; Vascularized tissue
   transfer; Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
AB BACKGROUND: Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt tend to epidural fluid accumulation after cranioplasty and also have a higher frequency of syndrome of the trephined after bone flap removal. Thus treatment of patients with postcranioplasty infection and a VP shunt is often challenging.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We treated 2 patients with postcranioplasty infection and a VP shunt. One patient had undergone decompressive craniectomy for cerebral hemorrhage, and the other patient had a large frontal dead space following resection of a brain tumor. Both patients were treated by immediate cranioplasty with obliteration of the epidural dead space by using a vascularized free latissimus dorsi muscle flap. In both of them, the postoperative course was uneventful without any complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Immediate cranioplasty and obliteration of the epidural dead space with a vascularized free latissimus dorsi muscle flap is an alternative for patients with postcranioplasty infection who are unfavorable candidates for temporary bone flap removal because of the risk of neurologic deterioration.

AB BACKGROUND: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar diskectomy (PELD) has evolved over the last decades and has become an effective treatment for soft disk herniations. However, while its use increases, newer complications have been discovered.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the unique case of a woman who underwent PELD/foraminotomy to treat right-side foraminal disk herniations on L4-5 and L5-S1 in the same procedure. Ten days after surgery, the patient developed fever and severe low back pain radiated down her right leg. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right pseudomeningocele arising from L4-5 and a nerve root herniated through the dural sac at the same lumbar segment. Blood cultures and fluid culture obtained from pseudomeningocele drainage depicted infection. Specific antibiotics were administrated, direct dura repair under the microscope was performed, and the patient improved symptomatically.
   CONCLUSIONS: PELD combined with foraminotomy is a relatively new and skill-demanding surgery which is indicated only in cases where foraminal disk herniation is combined with foraminal stenosis. This surgical strategy requires experience by the endoscopic surgeon to prevent procedure-related complications. Although rare, these complications can lead to increased morbidity.

   Vertebrae
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Postoperative paraplegia; Thoracic ossification of ligamentum flavum;
   Thoracolumbar kyphosis
ID SPINAL-CORD; MYELOPATHY; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a common cause of thoracic myeloradiculopathy. Thoracolumbar kyphosis derived from abnormal embryonic development of the spine vertebrae often progresses continuously and causes neurologic deterioration. These conditions are presented separately in most cases. A diagnosis of both OLF and thoracolumbar kyphosis in the same patient is rare, and no definite principle of surgical strategy for this case could be found in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report a 36-year-old woman who suffered from weakness and numbness of bilateral lower extremities for 2 years and urinary dysfunction for 1 month. On physical examination, the strength of muscles of lower limbs was grade 2 and the sensory system was bilaterally lost below the inguinal groove with numbness in the saddle area. Hyperreflexia was found in both lower limbs, and the Babinski sign was positive bilaterally. Thoracic OLF and thoracolumbar kyphosis were diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation, radiograph, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. We performed 1-stage laminectomy and kyphosis correction by posterior vertebral column resection. The patient experienced postoperative paraplegia, and the strength of muscles of lower limbs recovered to the preoperative level at 1-year follow-up and stopped improving until the 5-year follow-up. However, the urinary dysfunction became normal at 3 months postoperative. Kyphotic deformity was corrected from preoperative 83.5 degrees to 35.0 degrees at the final follow-up, and bone fusion was achieved around the mesh cage without implantation failure.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with thoracic OLF and thoracolumbar kyphosis derived from wedged vertebrae, 1-stage laminectomy and kyphosis correction has a risk that may lead to a negative outcome. Staging operation should be taken into consideration when planning a surgical strategy for the treatment of kyphosis associated with concurrent compressive myelopathy.

ID PRIMARY EWINGS-SARCOMA; INFANT; ENTITY; PNET; DURA
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pPNETs) are rare lesions, accounting for only 1% of all pPNETs, and usually arise from bone and soft tissue. These tumors primarily affect young patients (<30 years old) and rarely affect older patients. The common intracranial locations of these lesions are frontal dura and tentorium. These lesions rarely may involve the cerebellopontine angle, cavernous sinus, and jugular foramen. Involvement of clivus has not been reported to date. Intracranial metastasis from primary intracranial pPNET is a further rare occurrence.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old woman presented with gradually progressive painless diminution of vision in both eyes alongwith headache for 6 months duration. Radiology demonstrated a clival mass as well as a suspected intracranial metastasis. Histopathology was suggestive of pPNET. We also present a brief review of the literature on pPNETs.
   CONCLUSIONS: pPNETs of the clival region are exceptionally rare. In elderly patients with clival mass lesions, the rare possibility of pPNET should be kept in mind.

AB BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a kind L. are neurogenic malignancy, which usually arises from nerve fibers in any tissue and organ that have nerve fiber distributions, especially the trunk and extremities, but it is extremely rare in spinal canal.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 30-year-old woman who had a history of -ision of intraspinal occupying lesions 5 times and the pathologic diagnosis based on histomorphologic and immunohistochemistry was schwannomatosis, which existed in her family history. Unfortunately, she died because her condition deteriorated rapidly and appeared multiple lung metastases. MPNST was confirmed by needle biopsy of lung lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many cases of MPNST usually developed from neurofibromatosis type I However, the incidence of MPNST arising from schwannomatosis was extremely rare. More significantly, using genetic testing on her, we found a splice site mutation (c.1118+1G>A) that occurred between exons 8 and 9 of the SMARCB1 gene, which was first found in this MPNST patient and could lay the foundation for further study of its pathogenesis.

ID SARCOMA; MASS; CLASSIFICATION
AB BACKGROUND: Paraspinal masses are a relatively uncommon but diverse of lesions that can be neoplastic or non-neoplastic. Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the lumbar paraspinal region with diffuse and strong glial differentiation have never been reported before.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a primary paraspinal primitive neuroectodermal tumor with overwhelming glial differentiation in a 23-year-old female patient who presented with intractable right lower extremity pain. The patient underwent a 2-staged operation with gross total resection of the mass followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy and oral temozolomide, a regimen employed for high-grade intracranial gliomas. Serial imaging revealed no evidence of recurrence after 3 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although these lesions appear to be exceptionally rare, an approach similar to that of intracranial high-grade glial tumors was effective in our experience. Our patient had no evidence of recurrence at 3-year follow-up.

LA English
DT Article
DE Arteriovenous fistula; Complication; Onyx; Pipeline embolization device;
   Vertebral artery
ID MECHANICAL REMOVAL; ONYX; SOLITAIRE
AB BACKGROUND: Onyx, a liquid embolic agent, is the mainstay of embolization treatment of arteriovenous malformation or arteriovenous fistula. Microcatheter retention in an embolic cast is a well-known complication. Rupture of catheter with spillage of onyx is a rare phenomenon but can lead to potential occlusion of the parent vessel.
   METHODS: We describe a case in which a patient with ruptured arteriovenous fistula experienced rupture of a microcatheter at the proximal part and spillage of onyx on embolization. A Pipeline embolization device (PED) was successfully deployed, and onyx was jailed between the catheter and vessel wall at the third segment of the vertebral artery (V3 segment). A balloon angioplasty helped to complete the opening of the stent.
   RESULTS: The procedure was uneventful, and the patient recovered well. Follow-up angiogram revealed patency of posterior circulation. The 6-month follow-up angiogram revealed a patent stent.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microcatheter rupture and spillage of onyx during embolization of arteriovenous malformation/arteriovenous fistula is a potential complication, and management should be individualized. The unique close cell design of the PED was successfully used to avoid a potentially life-threatening occlusion of the vertebrobasilar system. To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time this novel use of PED.

DT Article
DE Endoscopic spine surgery; Laminectomy; Minimally invasive spine; SI
   joint fusion
AB BACKGROUND: Sacroiliac (SI) joint fusion is considered for the treatment of degenerative sacroiliitis. The procedure has increased in popularity for patients who have exhausted less invasive treatment options since the development of percutaneous SI joint fusion systems. One possible complication of the procedure is a sacral radiculopathy that can result from compression of the S1 nerve by the SI joint fusion implant. Others have described revising the implant by removing it and replacing it with a shorter implant.
   METHODS: Here we describe a minimally invasive end oscopic S1 nerve root decompression that does not require removing or revising the SI fusion implant.
   RESULTS: The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient's radicular pain improved immediately after surgery. Six months after his endoscopic procedure, the patient had no clinical symptoms related to the S1 nerve root compression and was symptomatically improved from her sacroiliac pain.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technical note is for others to consider as a possible minimally invasive solution for the treatment of lumbar radiculopathy after a minimally invasive SI joint fusion procedure.

AB BACKGROUND: Infectious aneurysm is a rare complication in intracranial aneurysm. Moreover, giant aneurysm is a rare entity in intracranial aneurysm. In the great majority of infectious intracranial aneurysms, vasculitis and/or endocarditis is associated.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we report the case of an 83-year-old man who developed a giant infectious intracranial aneurysm on the anterior communicating artery. This patient had never shown any intracranial bleeding. A surgery was performed, and purulent liquid and aneurysm wall were removed during procedure. The bacteriologic analyses reported Campylobacter fetus.
   CONCLUSIONS: This bacterium seems to be more and more frequent in North America and Europe, according to the current literature. Moreover, cases of mycotic extracranial aneurysm were reported. Here we report the first case of intracranial giant infectious aneurysm in an adult patient, without any endocarditis or vasculitis. This new entity could be the cause of a bacterial graft on an asymptomatic giant preexisting intracranial aneurysm or a consequence of campylobacteriosis.

AB Meningioma, a common primary brain tumor in adults, is graded based on World Health Organization criteria that rely on histology alone. This approach is unable to determine conclusively which tumors, especially benign or atypical, will recur. Molecular characterization of meningioma has identified genetic biomarkers that can predict tumor behavior. Only a few genetic changes are known to classify >85% of all meningioma and clinical trials using targeted therapy to genetic subtypes of meningioma are under way. Immunotherapy is also being trialed in treating high-grade and recurrent meningioma. This review summarizes recent developments characterizing meningioma using genetic and immunologic biomarkers and how these molecular tools may be integrated into existing care together with current World Health Organization grading to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.

TI Spontaneous Spinal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage with Development of an
   Arachnoid Cyst-A Case Report and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Review of the literature; Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage; Thoracic
   arachnoid cyst
ID ANEURYSMS
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is extremely rare and occurs in <1% of all cases of SAH. To the best of our knowledge, only 1 case of spontaneous spinal SAH with later development of a symptomatic spinal arachnoid cyst (SAC) has been described in the literature to date. The objective of the present study was to report the challenging clinical management of SAC based on a literature review.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 51-year-old woman with acute onset of back pain, neck pain, and headaches with an angiogram-negative supratentorial SAH. Further magnetic resonance imaging screening of the spine revealed additional subarachnoid blood at the level of the thoracic spine, without evidence of vascular malformations. Several weeks after the hemorrhage, the patient developed progressive numbness in her trunk and lower extremities and weakness in her lower extremities. A follow-up magnetic resonance imaging study revealed a large arachnoid cyst at level T4-T7 with spinal cord compression. The patient underwent left hemilaminectomy at T4-T6 and fenestration of the SAC. In a second surgery, right-sided hemilaminectomy at T7 was performed with complete marsupialization of the larger cyst and placement of an intradural shunt. At the 6-month clinical follow-up examination, she showed improvement of her clinical symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of secondary SAC is challenging, and surgery of the SAC with or without placement of a shunt is a possible treatment option.

ID CLINICAL ARTICLE; NATURAL-HISTORY; BALL-VALVE; PREVALENCE; PITUITARY;

AB BACKGROUND: Sellar arachnoid cysts are a rare occurrence but may impinge on vital parasellar anatomy and thus are often symptomatic. The etiology of sellar arachnoid cysts is contentious, fueled by heterogeneity in cyst wall structure and contents between cases. The "ball-valve" mechanism is 1 of 2 predominant theories describing their formation, which contends that an aperture in the diaphragm allows cerebrospinal fluid to enter the cyst, propelled by pulsatile flow, but its egress is obscured by the pituitary during the ebb of the pressure wave.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we present a case of a 51-year-old female with a symptomatic sellar arachnoid cyst. She underwent an endoscopic transphenoidal fenestration which alleviated her symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative video evidence during arachnoid cyst fenestration supports the "ball-valve" theory of sellar arachnoid cyst development.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Brain; Cerebellum; Dural defect; Spinal surgery; Superficial siderosis
ID INTRASPINAL HEMORRHAGE; DEFECT
AB BACKGROUND: Superficial siderosis (SS) of the central nervous system is a rare condition caused by hemosiderin deposition in the subpial layers of the brain and spinal cord. Surgical complications are the primary factor for occurrence of secondary SS. We present a case of SS with an identified bleeding origin in the thoracic spine.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old female patient experienced 9 months of continuous progressive dizziness, difficulty with mobilization, drop attacks, and lack of hearing. The patient also had an extensive history of thoracic spinal surgeries. She came to the hospital with gait imbalance. Gradient echo (GE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed hemosiderin deposition along the cerebellar folia and vermis. GE sequences are preferable in this diagnosis, because of higher sensitivity, and for detecting characteristic T2 hypointensity. The dural defect was repaired with an artificial dural patch in thoracal operation area. Clinical findings, imaging studies, intraoperative findings, and literature information are presented.
   CONCLUSIONS: Performance of an open neurosurgical procedure to repair a dural defect in the presence of MRI confirmed that superficial siderosis is an optimal method and a crucial step to ensure the safe resolution of the condition and to break the circle of emergency admissions of a patient with a dural defect and a history of multiple spinal surgeries.

ID TRAUMATIC SPONDYLOLISTHESIS; AXIS; MANAGEMENT; INJURIES; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Nonlethal cervical spine injuries in skydiving are rare due to associated high mortality. Here, we report an unusual pathomechanism leading to a Hangman fracture in a semiprofessional parachute athlete.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The moment of injury was captured on a first-person video and identified as a rough parachute opening deceleration during canopy deployment, caused by failure of the parachute inflation control device. Fractures of the C2 pars interarticularis with C2/C3 instability were treated by anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion, and the patient reached full recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Excessive deceleration during canopy deployment may pose a risk for life-threatening cervical spine injuries in skydiving.

AB BACKGROUND: Thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas (TSHomas) are uncommon, and majority of the patients present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Herein, we report the first case of TSHoma with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) that presented with visual disturbance without any clinical feature of hyperthyroidism.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old man presented with left temporal hemianopsia of his left eye without any sign of hyperthyroidism. A mass lesion in the sellar and suprasellar region compressing the optic nerves was identified via magnetic resonance imaging. Free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels were slightly elevated, whereas the serum level of thyroid-stimulating hormone remained within normal range. Further endocrinologic examination led to the preoperative diagnosis of TSHoma. Ultrasonography and 111In-octreotide scan showed a mass lesion in left lobe of the thyroid gland, and subsequent thyroid aspiration biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. After administration of short-acting octreotide to prevent thyrotoxic crisis in the perioperative period, the tumor was removed via endoscopic transnasal-transsphenoidal surgery, and the pathologic diagnosis of TSHoma was made. His visual acuity improved, and free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine levels normalized. He underwent thyroidectomy 3 months later after endoscopic transnasal-transsphenoidal surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report the first case of TSHoma with DTC that presented with visual disturbance without any clinical feature of hyperthyroidism and reviewed the 13 reported cases of TSHoma coexisting with DTC. The optimal treatment strategy in patients with TSHoma and coexistent DTC has not been established, and individualized therapeutic strategies are needed.

AB Although Tarlov cysts (TC) were first described in 1938, our understanding of these common spinal lesions remains poor. As TCs represent incidental findings in the vast majority of cases, evidence to guide their management is limited to small case series. When they are symptomatic, the presentation can have significant overlap with degenerative spine disease. This is the first report demonstrating growth of TCs. The patient underwent open surgical reduction of the symptomatic TCs, leading to improvement in her symptoms.

   PATIENT; CLASSIFICATION; CHILDHOOD
AB BACKGROUND: Rhabdoid meningiomas are rare World Health Organization grade 3 tumors that tend to follow an aggressive course, with an increased likelihood for local recurrence, remote metastasis, and cerebrospinal fluid dissemination. Genetic testing has found certain genes associated with reduced time to tumor recurrence. BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1) is a tumor suppressor gene that is associated with multiple tumors, including rhabdoid meningiomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a pediatric patient who presented with a rhabdoid meningioma occurring in the right tentorium and invading multiple venous structures, including the right jugular vein. The patient underwent 5 separate operations for management of this tumor. The first surgery was an intracranial tumor debulking with reconstruction of venous structures. Postoperatively, the patient was unable to have the ventricular catheter removed and underwent placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Significant recurrence of the intracranial portion of tumor was found during preoperative imaging for her second stage procedure. She underwent a second craniotomy for resection of the tumor. Her postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed significant residual tumor and the patient therefore underwent a third craniotomy for total tumor resection, which involved reconstruction of the superior sagittal sinus. She did well after this surgery, with no new neurologic deficits. Her final operation involved resection of the residual tumor in the neck and chest by both otolaryngology and cardiothoracic surgery. This surgery involved opening the jugular vein and resecting residual tumor from the intima. Pathologic results from all surgeries were consistent with rhabdoid meningioma; however, the tissue from the biopsy and first craniotomy lacked the high-grade features that were found on subsequent resections. Genetic analysis found loss of both BAP1 tumor suppressor genes. Peripheral blood testing showed that this patient was a germline carrier of a pathogenic BAP1 variant.
   DISCUSSION: Pediatric rhabdoid meningiomas represent a rare disease and are found on recurrent tumors in conjunction with lower-grade meningioma disease. Our patient presented with what was initially believed to be a low-grade meningioma with rhabdoid features, which then transformed into a World Health Organization grade Ill rhabdoid meningioma on recurrence. This tumor was discovered to have a biallelic loss of BAP-1 mutation and the patient was found to have a germline mutation in 1 of her BAP-1 alleles. Germline mutations in BAP-1 are associated with a cancer syndrome that involves uveal and cutaneous melanoma, malignant mesothelioma, atypical Spitz tumors, and clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Patients with this mutation are encouraged to undergo annual eye examinations starting at the age of 11 years. The BAP-1 tumor predisposition syndrome is most commonly an inherited mutation associated with incomplete penetrance and variation with nonoverlapping tumor types.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rhabdoid meningiomas are unlikely to be found in children and have a high rate of local recurrence. Gross total resection has to be balanced with risk of postoperative deficit. Genetic testing of this rare entity should be performed to identify any hereditary germline mutations.

AB Scalp cirsoid aneurysm is an arteriovenous fistula of the scalp that is unconnected by intracranial or cerebral vessels. Variceal dilatation of draining veins can produce cosmetic concerns, masses, local pain, palpable thrills, and audible bruits, headache, tinnitus, and hemorrhage. Its etiopathogenesis is not well understood. Treatment includes surgery (fistula repair by simple surgical ligation until gross total resection), embolization (whether percutaneous or endovascular), or a combination of the two. An updated systematic review of the last 10 years publications was performed. Also, we report an illustrative case of a young boy with posttraumatic cirsoid aneurysm and good documentation on head vascular examinations, treated by multiple routes (percutaneous embolization with coils and endovascular embolization with cyanoacrylate) with a decrease of the pulsatile mass. A plastic surgery team performed gross total resection, and the final esthetic result was extremely satisfactory.

The aim of our study was to describe new techniques to perform EVD using simple improvised materials to check the real-world applicability of the same device in the management of acute hydrocephalus and its effectiveness and safety.
   METHODS: We illustrated 2 techniques for a "do it yourself" improvised EVD device using materials available even in non-neurosurgery-dedicated operating rooms. We performed an observational study in our institution (April 2015 to December 2016). We included all patients presenting with acute hydrocephalus and requiring EVD.
   RESULTS: During a 20-month period, the new EVD device was used as a life-saving solution for 33 patients. Good outcomes were noted in 11 of the 33 patients (33%). The EVD was complicated by fatal meningitis in 4 of the patients (12%). Malfunction occurred in 6 patients. The new EVD device costs less than US$20 for the first technique and less than US$10 for the second technique. In contrast, the cost of a standard EVD set ranges from US$170 to US$380 in Tunisia.
   CONCLUSIONS: The new EVD device has the potential to improve the quality of efficiency of care in difficult economic times that have changed the medical landscape, because it is both easy to make and cost-effective. Because it is an inexpensive technique, it could also be suitable for low-income countries, where neurosurgery is not yet the first and foremost health priority.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) was defined by McAfee et al. in 2010 as a procedural approach that by virtue of surgical technique results in less collateral tissue damage, decreases morbidity, and provides patients with a more rapid recovery relative to traditional procedures.
   METHODS: We reviewed all of our publications and presentations regarding MISS and summarize the main components and guiding principles to perform MISS as routine standard of care.
   RESULTS: The 4 T's of MISS is a concept that references the key elements that determine the success of MISS cases. The 4 T's are target (the patient and patient selection), technology (setting of the operation), technique (the surgeon), and teaching/training.
   CONCLUSIONS: MISS is an advancing field that has rapidly progressed in the past decade, and its role in treating complex spinal pathology will continue to expand. The 4 T's and the 3 technical principles of MISS are requirements for successful MISS. MISS is a dynamic field that is developing in parallel with technology, especially as it impacts imaging and surgical implementation. The ultimate goal of MISS is to achieve spinal health in the least invasive manner while avoiding overtreatment. MISS gives patients the best chance at favorable outcomes and shortest possible recovery course, while minimizing iatrogenic spinal instability.

TI Learning Curve and Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Learning curve; Minimally invasive surgery; MIS TLIF
ID COMPLEX SURGICAL TECHNIQUE
AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery has become popular in recent times and has proved more advantageous than conventional open surgery methods, in terms of maximal preservation of natural anatomy and minimal postoperative complications. However, these advancements require a longer learning curve for inexperienced surgeons.
   OVERVIEW: The learning curve in minimally invasive spine surgery is complex and difficult to measure, and therefore operating times, conversion to open procedures, visual analog scale, and periods of hospital stay are used. In assessing complications as a measure of the learning curve, it was noted that nearly all the complications had been documented previously and became minimum after the 30th consecutive case. As surgical experience increases, perioperative parameters (e.g., operative time and length of hospitalization) improve. The downside of minimally invasive spine surgery is starting unfamiliar procedures without tactile sensation, working in a narrow restricted surgical field, and using endoscopes via two-dimensional imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate instruments, a trained team, and an adept radiographer are important assets for a smooth transition during the learning period. Structured training with cadavers and lots of practice, preferably while working under the guidance of experienced surgeons, is helpful. The learning curve can be shortened when a proficient surgeon gains relevant knowledge, understands three-dimensional anatomy, and has surgical aptitude along with manual dexterity.

AB BACKGROUND: Among spinal surgeons, the safety of endoscopic spinal techniques has been criticized as the result of a prolonged learning curve and divergent surgical technique from traditional microsurgery. In this manuscript, the authors assessed the learning curve of 4 experienced microsurgical neurosurgeons in endoscopic spinal surgery.
   METHODS: Retrospectively, the surgical reports, the endoscopic video recording, and the files of all patients who underwent an endoscopic procedure for the treatment of cervical and lumbar disc herniation from January 2011 to December 2017 were reviewed. The learning process was assessed via several parameters: surgical time, intraoperative complications, dural tear, nerve root injury, conversion to microsurgery, new postoperative neurologic deficits, repeated procedure, and early recurrent disc herniation.
   RESULTS: The learning process of for 4 surgeons was assessed on the basis of 308 procedures. The mean surgical time for the initial procedure ranges from 58 to 97 minutes and improved to 51-85 minutes for the last procedures. A shorter surgical time had no influence on the rate of intraoperative complication and repeated procedure. Increased working space had a significant influence on the surgical time. The number of procedure to reach the asymptote varied from 10 to 20 depending on the endoscopic system and the surgeon.
   CONCLUSIONS: The learning process in endoscopic tubular-assisted spinal surgery is variable, and the asymptote might be reached after 10-20 procedures. The amount of working space and instrument angulation affects the surgical time. The decrease of surgical time had no significant influence on the rate of intraoperative complication and repeated procedures.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI-TLIF) has become an increasingly popular method for lumbar arthrodesis. While having similar long-term outcomes when compared with open TLIF, it decreases the amount of intraoperative blood loss and iatrogenic muscle damage, the intensity of postoperative pain, and the duration of hospital stay. However, uncertainty remains about which factors contribute to outcomes in these patients. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze a cohort of patients submitted to MI-TLIF and to identify factors that can be associated with a worse postoperative outcome.
   METHODS: Clinical records from 283 patients were assessed and, according to Odom's criteria, postoperative clinical outcome at 12 months was classified as excellent, good, fair, and poor. Demographic variables, clinical data, and surgery-related data were analyzed, looking for associations between them and clinical outcome. A binomial logistic regression analysis was then performed to include those associations.
   RESULTS: The main variables associated with worse prognosis ("poor" class according to Odom's criteria) were a period of sick leave longer than 3 months before the surgery, age younger than 50 years, lytic spondylolisthesis, L5-S1 level, and occurrence of complications. These 5 conditions were included in a logistic regression analysis, and 3 of them were independently associated with poor outcome: operative complications, age younger than 50 years, and sick leave longer than 3 months before surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients, those on a sick leave for more than 3 months before surgery, or those who suffered surgical complications tended to have less satisfactory results after MI-TLIF.

ID PELVIC RING
AB OBJECTIVE: It is a novel choice to have reduction and internal fixation for sacral fracture with iliac screws starting around the posterior superior iliac spine and percutaneously interconnected.
   METHODS: This prospective work was performed at Ain Shams University Hospitals, Cairo, Egypt, during the period from January 2013 until January 2016. Fifty consecutive cases of longitudinal fractures of the sacrum were treated surgically using ileoileal fixation via minimal-access surgery.
   RESULTS: According to Pohlemann clinical score, 42 patients (84%) were rated to have excellent clinical result, 6 patients (12%) had a good clinical result, and 2 patients (4%) had a fair clinical result. Regarding social scoring, 34 patients returned back to their jobs with the same level of effort and recreational activities (68%). Ten patients returned to work but with changes in their capabilities and decreases in recreational activities (20%). Six patients changed their profession to another one that required less effort (12%). Regarding radiologic scores, 15 patients (30%) had maximum radiologic scoring (excellent), 30 patients (60%) had good, and 5 patients (10%) had fair reduction. In total, 33 patients (66%) had an excellent final result (10/10); 9 patients (18%) had a good final result (9/10), and 8 patients (16%) had a fair result (7-8/10).
   CONCLUSIONS: Fractures of the sacrum are challenging injuries regarding methods of fixation, choice of surgical approach, and the possibility of postoperative complications. Minimal-access ileoileal fixation provides a safe, rapid, and easy method for the fixation of such fractures. It is suitable for critical patients, as it is fast and performed with minimal blood loss. Also, because it does not require an image intensifier, it can be used in least-equipped situations, such as in war scenarios.

AB BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis found that for internal carotid artery stenosis procedures in elderly patients, the risk of perioperative stroke is significantly greater for carotid artery stenting (CAS) than for carotid endarterectomy. We retrospectively examined characteristics and perioperative results of CAS for patients 80 years and older at a single medical center.
   METHODS: A total of 97 patients with internal carotid artery stenosis underwent CAS using the dual-protection (simultaneous flow reversal and distal filter) and blood-aspiration method. We divided patients into 2 groups, octogenarian and non-octogenarian. We evaluated patient background, captured visible debris, in-stent protrusion, major adverse events (i.e., major stroke and death), and hyperintense spots on diffusion-weighted images after CAS.
   RESULTS: The success rate of the CAS procedure was 100% with no major adverse events within 30 days. We found vulnerable plaque in 50% (15/30 patients) and 26.9% (18/67 patients) of octogenarian and non-octogenarian groups, respectively (P = 0.047). Diffusion-weighted images revealed small hyperintense spots in 20% (6/30 patients) and 18.0% (12/67 patients) of the octogenarian and non-octogenarian groups, respectively (P = 0.785). Visible debris was observed in 43.3% (13/30 patients) and 22.4% (15/67 patients) of the octogenarian and non-octogenarian groups, respectively (P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: The plaque of carotid stenosis in octogenarians is often vulnerable, but using a dual protection and blood aspiration method, we safely performed CAS in octogenarian patients.

TI Assessment of Costs in Open Microsurgery and Stereotactic Radiosurgery

   radiosurgery; Value Driven Outcomes

AB OBJECTIVE: Understanding costs of microsurgical or radiosurgical treatment of intracranial meningioma may offer direction in reducing health care costs and establishing cost-effective algorithms. We used the Value Driven Outcomes database, which identifies cost drivers and tracks changes over time, to evaluate cost drivers for management of intracranial meningioma.
   METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort of patients undergoing microsurgery or radiosurgery of intracranial meningiomas from July 2011 to April 2017 was analyzed. Patient and tumor characteristics, subcategory costs, and potential cost drivers were analyzed within each treatment modality.
   RESULTS: Of 268 intracranial meningiomas, 198 were treated with microsurgery and 70 with stereotactic radiosurgery. Facility costs were the largest contributor to total costs for microsurgery (59.7%), whereas imaging costs were the largest contributor to stereotactic radiosurgery total costs (98.2%). Patients with non-skull base tumors had larger tumors (3.7 + 1.9 cm vs. 2.7 + 1.2 cm, P = 0.0001) and were more likely to undergo microsurgery (81.7% vs. 55.2%) than patients with skull base tumors. Univariate analysis suggested that American Society of Anesthesiologists status, length of stay, discharge disposition, and maximal tumor size impacted cost during microsurgery (P = 0.001), but only length of stay (P = 0.0001) and maximal tumor size (P = 0.01) were drivers of total costs on multivariate analysis. For radiosurgery, age significantly affected cost on univariate (P = 0.001) and multivariate (P = 0.003) analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Implementing protocols to reduce facility usage and imaging would mitigate total costs and improve resource utilization while maintaining high-quality patient care. Additional cost-effectiveness studies evaluating patients with true therapeutic equipoise will provide further guidance in these efforts.

   SURGICAL FINDINGS; CT ANGIOGRAPHY; NEUROSURGERY; DISPLAYS
AB OBJECTIVE: Stereoscopic viewing of computed tomographic angiography (CT-A) or magnetic resonance angiograms might increase the diagnostic potential of these imaging techniques. Our aim was to evaluate the benefits of a novel stereoscopic viewing system for aneurysm detection compared with standard monoscopic viewing.
   METHODS: Retrospective patient data were used for 2 different evaluations. First, monoscopic and stereoscopic CT-A viewing was compared by 14 clinicians in 10 patients with challenging (i.e., small and initially CT-A negative) aneurysms. Second, stereoscopic CT-As and the reference standard, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), were compared in 15 patients with randomly selected aneurysms by 12 clinicians. The study participants rated the presence and location of any aneurysm and its morphological characteristics. The detection rates and interrater reliability were calculated.
   RESULTS: The first evaluation showed superior aneurysm detection in challenging cases using stereoscopic versus monoscopic CT-A viewing (median: monoscopic, 20%; interquartile range DM 10%-32.5%; stereoscopic, 40%; IQR, 27.5%-42.5%). The interrater reliability analysis revealed good to excellent agreement among raters for aneurysm detection in both viewing modalities (monoscopic, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC(2,1)], 0.798; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.549-0.941; stereoscopic viewing, ICC(2,1), 0.895; 95% CI, 0.770-0.968). The second part demonstrated that stereoscopic CT-A viewing is comparable to DSA viewing for aneurysm detection (median: DSA, 80%; IQR, 73%-100%; stereoscopic CT-A, 87%; IQR, 87%-93%). The interrater reliability analysis revealed excellent absolute agreement in aneurysm detection between DSA and stereoscopic CT-A viewing (DSA: ICC(2,1), 0.971; 95% CI, 0.944 -0.989; stereoscopic CTA: ICC(2,1), 0.972; 95% CI, 0.945 -0.989). The aneurysm detection rates correlated significantly with the participants' years of experience.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stereoscopic viewing of CT-As increases the diagnostic accuracy and represents a promising technique to reduce the need for invasive DSA.

ID DYNAMIC STABILIZATION; LUMBAR SPINE; INSTRUMENTATION; FUSION; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Infection follow-up in patients stabilized with the Dynesys system. Infection rates were determined in patients who had >= 5 segments stabilized with the Dynesys system.
   METHODS: Eighty-three patients with various etiologies were stabilized with the Dynesys system. Long-level stabilization patients were separated from the main group as a result of their high rates of infection.
   RESULTS: Long-level stabilizations were performed in 8 of 83 patients. Five patients were determined to have infections including 4 deep infections and 1 superficial infection. In patients with deep infections, 3 of them exhibited chronic infections that lasted for approximately 2 years and the system was removed. A deep infection in 1 patient and a superficial infection in 1 patient were diagnosed after 1 month. The early-diagnosed deep infection patient was treated with wound irrigation and antibiotics. The system was not removed, and the wound was closed with daily dressing after 45 days. One superficial infection patient was only treated with daily dressing, and the infection healed within 2 weeks. The infectious agent was determined in 2 patients. Three patients in the chronic infection group underwent a surgical procedure to remove the system. Specific antibiotic treatments were administered to patients whose infectious agents were identified. The remaining patients were treated with wide-spectrum antibiotics.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report that long-level stabilization with the Dynesys system results in a high infection rate.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes in the surgical management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been shown to vary across different hospital institutions. The effect of the safety-net burden on postoperative mortality, complication rates, and failure to rescue rates is unclear. We evaluated the relationship of the safety-net burden with outcomes in the treatment of patients with severe TBI undergoing neurosurgery.
   METHODS: The hospitals were grouped according to their safety-net burden, defined as the proportion of Medicaid and uninsured patient charges for all hospitalizations during that time. Multivariate analyses were performed to examine significant associations with the degree of safety-net burden while controlling for potential confounders.
   RESULTS: Data from 20,989 encounters in 788 hospitals were included. Compared with low-burden hospitals (LBHs), high-burden hospitals (HBHs; odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.12; P= 0.03) had greater mortality rates. Major complications were more likely to occur at HBHs (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.84; P< 0.01) compared with LBHs. The failure to rescue rates were similar among all safety-net burden hospital groups. Patients at HBHs also had an increased likelihood of an extended length of stay (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.12-3.29; P = 0.02) and receiving a tracheostomy or gastrostomy (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.36-2.89; P < 0.01) compared with patients at LBHs.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that a greater hospital safety-net burden was independently associated with greater rates of mortality and major complications in the treatment of patients with severe TBI undergoing neurosurgery. Further research in evaluating the cause of disparities in mortality outcomes at high safety-burden hospitals is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: We describe and quantitatively assess minimally invasive keyhole retrosigmoid approaches targeted to the upper, middle, and lower cranial nerve (CN) complexes of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA).
   METHODS: Anatomic dissections were performed on 10 sides of 5 fixed, silicone-injected cadaver heads. Surgical views through various trajectories were assessed in endoscopic videos and 3-dimensional (3D) interactive virtual reality microscope views. Surgical freedom and angles of attack to the proximal and distal areas of CN complexes of the CPA were compared among upper and lower keyholes and conventional retrosigmoid craniotomy using neuronavigation.
   RESULTS: Compared with keyholes, the conventional approach had superior surgical freedom to most areas except for the distal CN V, the root of CN VII, and the root of CN IX, where differences were not significant. The conventional retrosigmoid approach provided a larger horizontal angle of attack than either the upper or lower keyholes for all selected areas; however, the vertical angles of attack were not different. Splitting the petrosal fissure resulted in a significant increase in the vertical angle of attack to the root zones of CNs V and VII but not to the distal areas of these nerves or CN IX. Illustrative cases of endoscope-assisted keyhole retrosigmoid approaches for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia are presented.
   CONCLUSIONS: Targeted keyhole retrosigmoid approaches require detailed understanding of the 3D anatomy of the CPA to create appropriate locations of corridors, including skin incisions and keyholes. Endoscope assistance complements the standard microsurgical technique by maximizing the visualization and identification of the delicate neurovascular structures.

AB OBJECTIVE: Type II odontoid fractures of the axis (C2) account for more than 20% of all cervical fractures. If an odontoid screw is contraindicated, the treatment approach for type II C2 fractures typically involves C1-C2 posterior fusion or occipito-cervical (O-C) fusion, each of which has distinct advantages and disadvantages. In this study, postoperative outcomes of C1-C2 fusion and O-C fusion for high cervical fractures were compared.
   METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried to determine 30-day surgical outcomes of posterior C1-C2 fusion versus O-C fusion for adult patients with C2 fractures between 2005 and 2016. Demographics, operative factors, and postoperative events were analyzed, including returns to the operating room, readmission, and death.
   RESULTS: In total, 165 patients were identified. A majority of the patients (142, 86.1%) had independent functional status, although 133 (80.6%) had an American Society of Anesthesiologists classification ranging from 3 to 5, representing poor preoperative health. A significantly greater proportion of O-C (9.1%) versus C1-C2 fusion (1.7%) returned to the operating room (odds ratio 6.465, confidence interval 1.079-38.719, P = 0.041). The length of operation approached statistical significance (P = 0.053) between the 2 groups, with O-C fusion group having a longer average length of operation (196.4 minutes) versus the C1-C2 group (164.0 minutes).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a snapshot of the risk profiles of C1-C2 and O-C fusion for C2 fracture, demonstrating a statistically higher risk of reoperation in O-C fusion versus C1-C2 fusion. Future randomized trials are needed to identify the preferred technique to improve patient outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: This study investigated the outcome of transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for Cushing disease (CD) and the influence of our surgical strategy on remission rates and postoperative pituitary function.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 71 patients with CD who underwent microscope navigation TSS (MN-TSS) in Saint-Luc Hospital between 1996 and 2017. True remission was defined as normal fasting cortisol level, normal 24-hour urinary free cortisol, or continued need for hydrocortisone replacement for 1 year after surgery.
   RESULTS: Overall remission rate after 1 or repeated MN-TSS was 83%. Highest remission rate was found in patients with macroadenomas (92%). Successful first MN-TSS was correlated with a high final remission rate (95%), whereas failed first MN-TSS was correlated with a low final remission rate (36%). Although day 1 cortisol levels were significantly lower in patients with long-term remission, high levels were still observed in a few patients, especially those who had had CD for many years. We found a low rate of postoperative pituitary long-term hypofunction (9.7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: MN-TSS is a safe and effective procedure to treat CD, allowing remission rates of 83%. One-year remission period after first surgery is correlated with a final remission rate of 95%. Although day 1 morning cortisol value is the most significant predictor for long-term remission, some patients with CD for many years may keep high postoperative cortisol levels and be in later remission, likely because of secondary adrenal hyperplasia. Our focused approach with microscope navigation resulted in low rates of postoperative pituitary hypofunction and kept a recurrence rate comparable to that in the literature.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Programs that -dress overall wellbeing early in residency are necessary to prevent physician burnout and promote physician mental health to improve patient outcomes and ensure long and productive careers. A wellness initiative was implemented at our institution 3 years ago. We present feedback from participating residents across all levels of training.
   METHODS: A 17-question survey was administered to resident physicians in the department of neurosurgery at our institution. In addition to the resident survey results, we obtained personal perspective pieces from attendings and residents across all levels of training.
   RESULTS: A total of 8 resident physicians completed a --question survey. 100% of participants felt that health and wellness initiatives are "very important" for resident physicians, that the initiative has been "largely positive" for the department overall, and that is has positively impacted their personal life in addition to their professional life. The majority (75%) of respondents indicated that participation has not affected patient care responsibilities "at all."
   CONCLUSIONS: Participating resident perceptions of the wellness program are highly favorable. The survey results, combined with the perspectives across training levels, provide insight for other programs wishing to implement program of their own.

DT Article
DE Goals of care; Neurocritical care unit; Nonbeneficial care; Prognosis
ID LIFE; END; SCORE; COST
AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether a set of simple criteria can identify patients in the neuroscience intensive care unit (NICU) at high risk of poor outcome and delivery of nonbeneficial care early in the course of their illness. Secondarily, factors affecting limitation of care protocols were assessed.
   METHODS: We prospectively identified patients who were admitted to the NICU with partial loss of brainstem reflexes persisting for >24 hours due to an intrinsic lesion of the brain (trauma, stroke, hemorrhage, etc.).
   RESULTS: The study included 102 patients. Seventy-two of them died after a mean of 16 days (median: 8 days), and 23 remained comatose, locked-in, or in a vegetative state. Four were conscious and following commands, while 3 were minimally conscious, episodically obeying simple commands. Three out of 4 conscious patients were young males with traumatic brain injuries. Patients who remained full code spent a mean of 22.2 days in the NICU, compared with 10.4 for those who had withdrawal of care (P = 0.022) and 11.9 for patients who received a do-notresuscitate order (P = 0.045). Time to death did not differ significantly between the groups. Overall, institution of various limitations of care protocols correlated positively with older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07, P = 0.0008), being treated on the neurology service (OR = 4.4, P = 0.043), and having health insurance (OR = 5.4, P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: We identified simple criteria that can be used to identify patients in the NICU setting for whom continued aggressive care is likely nonbeneficial. Our analysis revealed demographic, social, and economic factors correlating with proxies' willingness to consider limitation of care.

   PREVALENCE; DIAGNOSIS; FUSION; SERIES
AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of the proposed NeuroSpine Surgery Research Group Classification System through a retrospective analysis of patients treated surgically for lumbar facet joint cysts at a single institution.
   METHODS: In a cohort of 166 patients, sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images were used to measure degree of spondylolisthesis, whereas axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance images were used to determine the percentage of vertebral canal occupied by the cyst. Grading was performed by 2 observers. Statistical analysis was conducted to correlate the given grades of each cyst with the treatment performed and the long-term outcomes of cyst and pain recurrence.
   RESULTS: In total, 158 were treated by decompression, whereas 8 underwent decompression with fusion; 25% of patients presented with a grade 1 cyst, 45% with a grade 2, 13% with a grade 3, 13% with a grade 4, and 4% with a grade 5 cyst. Of patients treated by decompression alone, a greater rate of recurrence was seen in grades 4 and 5 (29.4% and 33.3%) when compared with grades 1-3 (8.8%, 8.5%, and 0%, respectively, P < 0.05). There were no cases of a cyst recurrence after a fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: The proposed NeuroSpine Surgery Research Group Classification System for lumbar facet joint cysts is effective in identifying patients most likely to endure a recurrent cyst after decompressive surgery. Patients with grades 4 and 5 cysts should be considered for decompressive surgery with concomitant stabilization of the involved segments on initial presentation.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite the latest developments in microsurgery, electrophysiological monitoring, and neuroimaging, the surgical management of intrinsic brainstem lesions remains challenging. Several safe entry points have been described to access the different surfaces of the brainstem. Knowledge of this entry zone anatomy is critical to performing a safe and less morbid approach. To access the anterior midbrain surface, a well-known entry point is the anterior mesencephalic (AM) zone. Our aim was to quantify surgical AM zone exposure through the orbitozygomatic (OZ) and subtemporal (ST) approaches. We also analyzed the angular exposure along the horizontal and vertical axis angles for the AM zone.
   METHODS: Ten cadaveric heads were dissected using the OZ and ST approaches for anterior midbrain surface exposure. A neuronavigation system was used to determine the 3-dimensional coordinates. The area of surgical exposure, angular exposure, and anatomical limits of each craniotomy were evaluated and determined using software analysis and compared for intersection areas and AM safe zone exposure.
   RESULTS: The median surgical exposure was 164.7 +/- 43.6 mm(2) for OZ and 369.8 1 70.1 mm(2) for ST (P = 0.001). The vertical angular exposure was 37.7 degrees +/- 9.92 degrees for the OZ and 18.4 degrees +/- 2.8 degrees for the ST opening (P < 0.001). The horizontal angular exposure to the AM zone was 37.9 degrees +/- 7.3 degrees for the OZ and 47.0 degrees +/- 3.2 degrees for the ST opening (P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the OZ craniotomy offers reduced surgical exposure, it provides a better trajectory to the AM zone compared with the ST approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: Because the clinical course of spontaneous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) can be compromised by pulmonary complications, we sought to review post-treatment outcomes in aSAH patients with and without pulmonary complications.
   METHODS: Patient demographic, clinical, and outcome data (March 2003-January 2007) were analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent microsurgical or endovascular treatment for aSAH; pulmonary complications were reported. Outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at the 1-year, 3-year, and 6-year follow-up visits.
   RESULTS: The cohort comprised 471 patients (mean age, 53.7 +/- 12.4 years; men, 332/471 [70%]). The mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at presentation was 11.9 1 3.0. Of 471 patients, 47% (n = 223) presented with a Hunt and Hess score of Z3 and 76% (n = 357) with a Fisher grade of 3. Treatment was clipping for 69% (279/407) and coiling for 31% (128/407) of patients. Pulmonary complications occurred in 210 of 471 (45%) patients. Nearly one-half of patients were discharged to home (215/471, 46%), and more than one-half had a good outcome defined as a GOS score of 5 at their 1-year (226/403, 56%), 3-year (217/397, 55%), and 6-year (203/380, 53%) follow-up visits. Logistic regression showed age and GCS scores as outcome predictors at all time points, whereas pulmonary complications predicted poor outcome only at the 1-year follow-up visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary problems represent the most common nonneurologic medical complications after aSAH. Despite advances in critical care, pulmonary complications represented predictors of short-term poor outcome only at the 1-year follow-up visit, whereas the medical history of the patient became more relevant for prognosis in long-term follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although sagittal spinal balance is known to affect the outcome of spinal deformity surgery, its effect on simple decompression surgery is not well understood.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression for lumbar canal stenosis were prospectively enrolled in the study. Before surgery and 6 months after surgery, the following sagittal-alignment parameters were measured: lumbar lordosis ILL), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis (PI-LL), and sagittal vertical axis (SVA). At the same time, short-form 36 (SF-36) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were estimated. The patients were divided into the poor postoperative physical score group (P_poor), good postoperative physical score group (P_good), poor postoperative VAS group (V_poor), or good postoperative VAS group (V_good). The postoperative spinopelvic parameters were compared between the physical score and VAS groups, respectively. Finally, we examined the correlation between the spinopelvic parameters and the outcome scores using scatter plots and linear regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled into the study. Although the spinopelvic parameters (LL, PT, PI-LL) significantly improved after surgery, the absolute values of improvement were relatively small. The postoperative spinopelvic parameters were significantly worse in the P_poor and the V_poor groups compared with the P_good and the V_good groups, respectively. The correlation analyses also showed that worse postoperative spinopelvic parameters correlated to worse outcome in SF-36 and VAS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sagittal spinal balance significantly affected the outcome of patients undergoing decompression surgery for lumbar canal stenosis, the knowledge of which may serve better patient management.

AB BACKGROUND: A ruptured vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm (VADA) with a high clinical grade (Hunt and Hess grade 5) has a devastating prognosis. Because of the high rebleeding rate and location, rapid mortality can occur in patients owing to brainstem compression. Adjuvant decompression of the posterior fossa after securing the aneurysm may improve the outcomes of these patients.
   METHODS: Between January 2011 and December 2016, 22 patients who presented with Hunt and Hess grade 5 ruptured VADA underwent endovascular treatment. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (n = 12) received conventional endovascular treatment of VADA and external ventricular drainage, and group 2 (n = 10) received external ventricular drainage and suboccipital craniectomy for posterior fossa decompression after rapid endovascular trapping of VADA.
   RESULTS: In group 2, the survival rate and good clinical outcome rate (modified Rankin scale score <= 2) were 80% and 60%, respectively, which were favorable to the corresponding rates in group 1 (66.67% and 16.67%). Moreover, 80% of patients (8/10) in group 2 regained consciousness compared with 50% of patients in group 1.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant decompression of the posterior fossa can improve outcomes in patients with Hunt and Hess grade V ruptured VADA.

AB BACKGROUND: The effect of age on adult brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains unclear. The aim of this study is to compare AVM outcomes between elderly (age >= 60 years) and nonelderly adult patients.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pooled data comprising patients who underwent SRS for AVMs between 1987 and 2014 at 8 centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation. Adult (age >= 18 years) patients with >= 12 months follow-up were dichotomized into elderly and nonelderly cohorts, and matched in a 1:1 ratio. Favorable outcome was AVM obliteration without permanent symptomatic radiation-induced changes (RIC) or post-SRS hemorrhage.
   RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 1845 patients (188 elderly vs. 1657 nonelderly) who met the inclusion criteria, and subsequent matching resulted in 181 patients in each cohort. In the matched cohorts, rates of obliteration (54.7% vs. 64.6%; P = 0.054) favorable outcome (51.4% vs. 61.3%; P = 0.056) were no different between the elderly and nonelderly cohorts. The rates of post-SRS hemorrhage (9.9% vs. 5.5%; P = 0.115), RIC (26.5% vs. 30.9%; P = 0.353), symptomatic RIC (9.4% vs. 9.4%; P = 1.000), and permanent symptomatic RIC (3.3% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.750) were also not significantly different between the elderly and nonelderly cohorts. Elderly patients with AVM did have a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality (27.7% vs. 5.5%; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age does not seem to significantly affect obliteration or complication rates after SRS for AVMs. Although the decision to recommend intervention for AVMs in the elderly population is multifactorial, SRS may be a viable modality when treatment is deemed appropriate.

TI A New Optimal Marker to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Endoscopic Third
   Ventriculostomy During Operation: "Folding Sign"

ID CHILDHOOD HYDROCEPHALUS; LILIEQUIST MEMBRANE; SUCCESS SCORE; PRESSURE;
   PREDICTION
AB OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) remains the mainstay of treatment for noncommunicating hydrocephalus these days. However, there has been no adequate clue for the intraoperative assessment of ETV efficacy until now. This time, we propose a newly defined finding, "folding sign," which is visible and enables us to confirm penetration of both the third ventricle floor and the Liliequist membrane (LM) during operation. In this report, we describe consecutive ETV cases and discuss the mechanism of folding sign and its clinical meanings.
   METHODS: A folding sign is a formation of a sequence of folds at the tectal region, which is easily detectable. A total of 30 patients with newly diagnosed hydrocephalus between October 2014 and February 2018 at Tokyo Women's Medical University were enrolled in our case series (age range, 3 months to 74 years). The difference between proportions was analyzed by the chi(2) method.
   RESULTS: In all, 12 patients (40%) showed a folding sign: congenital hydrocephalus including aqueductal stenosis (AS) and isolated fourth ventricle in 4 patients, and brain tumoreassociated noncommunicating hydrocephalus in 8 patients. Statistical analysis showed that the emergence of a folding sign was related to successful ETV, indicating it as an optimal intraoperative sign to assess the effectiveness of this procedure (P = 0.0298).
   CONCLUSION: The folding sign is a newly defined sign to predict the success of ETV during operation. This optimal finding appears only when the LM is sufficiently opened; therefore, it could be a good candidate for an intraoperative assessment tool.

AB BACKGROUND: Indirect revascularization is simple and safe, but it is not commonly used in adult moyamoya disease owing to its unreliable effect. This prospective study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of indirect revascularization in treating adult moyamoya disease after refinement of the surgical technique and perioperative care.
   METHODS: Adult patients who underwent indirect revascularization as the primary treatment for moyamoya disease between November 2013 and January 2017 were studied. The indirect revascularization procedures included encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis and encephalo-myo-synangiosis in the temporal region and encephalo-pericranio-synangiosis in other hypoperfusion areas. The preoperative and postoperative clinical conditions, cerebral angiography findings, and time-to-peak prolongation areas on magnetic resonance perfusion studies were assessed to evaluate the revascularization effect. Refinements of the surgical technique included the selection of surgical area based on perfusion imaging, craniotomy size, and number of affected hemispheres, along with the inclusion of a dural flap in every procedure.
   RESULTS: Nineteen patients (17 females and 2 males), and a total of 31 cerebral hemispheres, were included. The mean patient age was 32.7 +/- 11.4 years. After a mean follow-up of 38.6 +/- 11.5 months, all patients showed clinical improvement or stabilization. Available postoperative angiography demonstrated Matsushima grade A or B in 19 of 21 hemispheres. The mean time-to-peak prolongation index of all 31 hemispheres improved from 24.09 +/- 9.83% preoperatively to 12.82 +/- 6.75% at 3-6 months after surgery (P < 0.001). The complication rate was 12.9%, and all complications were transient.
   CONCLUSIONS: With refinements of surgical techniques and perioperative care, indirect revascularization is more reliable and can be a viable alternative treatment for adult moyamoya disease. In our cohort, outcomes were satisfactory, with mean 38.6-month follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new surgical tool combining suction and monopolar neurostimulation (stimulation sucker) for cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors. The usefulness for continuous (time) and dynamic (space) facial nerve mapping was studied.
   METHODS: Patients operated on with the stimulation sucker for a CPA tumor between April 2016 and May 2017 in a tertiary care center were identified. Clinical charts were retrospectively evaluated. The minimum follow-up time of patients was 12 months.
   RESULTS: The study population included 17 patients with tumor (6 women and 11 men). The age range was from 2 to 77 years (mean age, 45.7 years; standard error of the mean, 22.7 years). Most CPA tumors were large (Koos grade 4) vestibular schwannomas (n = 10); other pathologies included petrous meningioma (n = 1), metastasis (n = 1), medulloblastoma (n = 2), ependymoma (n = 2), and pilocytic astrocytoma (n = 1). One patient with trigeminal neuralgia served as the normal control subject. No complications because of the stimulation sucker were encountered. Clinical and radiologic outcomes compared favorably with institutional experience and literature. The stimulation sucker allowed for continuous (time) mapping of the facial nerve at the site of resection (space). This real-time feedback allowed early identification of the facial nerve. Handling and ergonomy were excellent and workflow improved. The shortcomings compared with a bayonet-shaped bipolar probe were decreased visibility of neurovascular structures and lower spatial discrimination. The new device did not simplify delicate at the brainstem and on the nerve. We think it should be considered as a complementary tool in the surgeon's armamentarium.
   CONCLUSIONS: Until now, nerve damage as assessed by neuromonitoring (e. g., facial nerve electromyography, motor evoked potential) served as surrogate for nerve function. This concept should be challenged. The studied stimulation sucker detected the facial nerve earlier than conventional techniques, preventing harm by surgical trauma. A larger, prospective study is warranted to better define its role in CPA surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: hi the United States, the number of posterior cervical fusions has increased substantially. Perioperative neurologic complications associated with this procedure, such as spinal cord and peripheral nerve injuries, can have significant effects on patient health. We examined the impact of perioperative neurologic deficits on mortality in patients undergoing posterior cervical fusion. The secondary aim was to understand the risk factors for perioperative neurologic complications.
   METHODS: Data were collected from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) Health Cost Utilization Project (HCUP) between 1999 and 2011. Patients younger than 18 years and older than 80 years were excluded, as were patients who underwent posterior cervical fusion caused by trauma. Patient demographics and comorbidities were compiled as well as variables that have been associated with increased risk of perioperative neurologic deficits. We used the van Walraven score, a weighted numeric surrogate for the Elixhauser comorbidity index, as a covariate to assess comorbidities that have been associated with in-hospital mortality and morbidity after posterior cervical fusion. In addition, we performed univariate comparisons between covariates and surgical outcomes. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for many of the covariates, as well as trend analyses.
   RESULTS: An analysis of 33,644 patients yielded an overall rate of perioperative neurologic deficits, morbidity, and mortality of 1.08%, 40.44%, and 1.00%, respectively. Perioperative neurologic deficits were independent risk factors predictors of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 5.270; P < 0.0001) and morbidity (odds ratio, 2.579; P < 0.0001). Other statistically significant predictors of mortality included increasing van Walraven score, myocardial infarction, metastatic cancer, and weight loss. These were also independent predictors of morbidity along with but not limited to age, device complications, congestive heart failure, paralysis, diabetes with chronic complications, deficiency anemias, device complications, and intraspinal abscess.
   CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative neurologic deficits are serious complications of posterior cervical fusion and can independently predict in-hospital mortality and morbidity. As this procedure continues to be used increasingly, attention should be directed toward preventing these complications and intervening earlier in patients who have a neurologic deficit. Future efforts should be geared toward screening for at-risk patients with the initiation of surgical prehabilitation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of a Gamma Knife boost after intensity-modulated radiation therapy in combination with multimodal therapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and sinonasal malignancies with skull base or cavernous sinus involvement.
   METHODS: Nine patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy followed by a Gamma Knife boost. In one case Gamma Knife was given as salvage treatment after resection. Five patients had sinonasal malignancies and 4 had nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The mean radiation therapy dose was 64.3 Gy (range, 54-70 Gy) at 2 Gy per fraction. The median interval from completion of radiation therapy to Gamma Knife boost was 2.2 months (range, 1-4 months). The most common indication for Gamma Knife boost was involvement of the cavernous sinus, which was identified in 7 patients. The median margin Gamma Knife dose delivered was 13 Gy (range, 12-20 Gy), with median prescription isodose of 50%.
   RESULTS: All patients tolerated the procedure well, with minimal toxicity. Local control rates were achieved in all patients and no acute grade 3-5 toxicity was observed. One patient experienced late grade 4 toxicity, which was potentially attributable to treatment. Distant failure occurred in 3 patients (1 patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 2 patients with sinonasal malignancies).
   CONCLUSIONS: Planned Gamma Knife boost followed intensity-modulated radiation therapy is feasible, safe, and provides excellent local control in patients with sinonasal malignancies and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, particularly in cases with cavernous sinus involvement. Further followup will be necessary to determine the long-term effectiveness and complication profile.

AB INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of tranexamic acid to control blood loss from lumbar spinal fusion surgery remains controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the influence of tranexamic acid on blood loss from lumbar spinal fusion surgery.
   METHODS: We searched PuhMed, Embase, Web of Science, EBSCO, and the Cochrane Library databases through March 2018 for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of tranexamic acid on blood loss from lumbar spinal fusion surgery. A meta-analysis was performed using the random-effect model.
   RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials involving 394 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with control group for lumbar spinal fusion surgery, tranexamic acid significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss (standard mean difference [Std. MD] -0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.58 to -0.06; P = 0.02), and drain (Std. MD -1.12; 95% CI -1.59 to -0.64; P < 0.00001) but had no remarkable influence on hemoglobin (Std. MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.56 to 0.37; P = 0.68) and hematocrit (Std. MD -0.34; 95% CI -1.08 to 0.40; P = 0.37) 1 day after surgery and transfusion (risk ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.16-1.19; P = 0.11). Duration of hospitalization was found to be shortened by tranexamic acid (Std. MD -1.00; 95% CI -1.68 to -0.32; P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Tranexamic acid has an important ability to decrease intraoperative blood loss and hospitalization for lumbar spinal fusion surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: In percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy (PETD), surgeons are exposed to intraoperative radiographic radiation over a long-term career, which may he correlated with high risk of iatrogenic radiation hazards. The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to assess the impact of concentric stereotactic technique on radiation exposure to surgeons in PETD.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent conventional PETD were regarded as group A, whereas those undergoing PETD with concentric stereotactic technique were considered as group B. The primary outcomes were cumulative radiation dose to the surgeon's eye, thyroid gland, and breast.
   RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were treated in group A and 30 patients were treated in group B. The cumulative radiation dose of the eye per operation was 0.017 (0.58/34) mSv in group A and 0.010 (0.31/30) mSv in group B, which meant a reduction of 41.18/0. The cumulative radiation dose of the thyroid gland per operation was 0.018 (0.60/34) mSv in group A and 0.011 (0.33/30) mSv in group B, which meant a reduction of 38.89%. The cumulative radiation dose of the chest per operation was 0.039 (1.33/34) mSv in group A and 0.023 (0.70/30) mSv in group B, which meant a reduction of 41.03%. There were no significant differences in hospital stay, visual analog scale score of waist and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index score, MacNab satisfaction, and complications between the 2 groups (P> 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The concentric stereotactic technique can effectively reduce radiation exposure to surgeons by about 40%.

AB OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a devastating neurologic injury and remains a major cause of death in the world. Secondary injury after TBI is associated with long-term disability in patients with TBI. This study evaluated adrenomedullin (AM) on secondary injury and neurologic functional outcome in rats after TBI.
   METHODS: Forty-eight Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned into 3 groups: sham, TBI, and TBI with AM groups. TBI was induced by fluid percussion injury, and AM was intravenously injected. Neurologic function was examined at 2, 3, and 7 days after TBI. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to test tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-8 levels in the brain. Brain edema and bloodebrain barrier (BBB) permeability in brain tissue were tested. Western blot was used to examine the expression of aquaporin-4, phosphorylated myosin lightchain, and cleaved caspase-3. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling was used to test the apoptosis.
   RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 levels, brain edema, BBB permeability, neurologic examination scores, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells, and expression of aquaporin-4, phosphorylated myosin light-chain, and cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased in the TBI group. AM treatment significantly inhibited TBI-induced effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: AM can improve neurologic function and ameliorate brain injury in rats with TBI. AM exerts its neuroprotective effect via its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effect.

AB BACKGROUND: The contralateral anterior interhemispheric approach (CAIA) is considered to provide surgical advantages to access deep midline lesions: wider working angle, gravity enhanced dissection and retraction, more efficient lighting, and ergonomics. Our team has previously published on the merits of using a contralateral trajectory for medial frontoparietal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) compared with the conventional anterior interhemispheric approach (IAIA). In this article, we compare the IAIA and CAIA for the resection of medial frontoparietal AVMs using quantitative surgical and anatomical analysis.
   METHODS: Two models were designed mimicking the most common features of midline AVMs. The CAIA and IAIA were performed bilaterally in 10 specimens. Variables to compare technical feasibility (surgical window [SW] and surgical freedom [SF], target exposure, and angle of attack) were independently assessed using stereotactic navigation. The average SW, SF, and angle of attack were compared with the Student t test. Significance threshold was set at 0.05.
   RESULTS: The CITA and IAIA were similar in terms of SW, target exposure, and SF in the superior aspect of the AVM. In the depth of the interhemispheric fissure, the CAIA was significantly superior to IAIA in both AVM models: 77% wider AA for the inferior aspect of the AVM (P < 0.01) and greater SF for the draining vein (54%, P = 0.01), ipsilateral (98%, P = 0.02), and contralateral ACA (117%, P< 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests technical superiority of the CAIA for the resection of deep midline AVMs. No objective difference was noted in the superficial areas of our models, denoting that IAIA is a safer choice for superficial AVMs. Our results set the foundation for further clinical analysis comparing both approaches.

ID MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; BRAIN; HEMICRANIECTOMY
AB OBJECTIVE: Since 2009, we have performed skin augmentation using a Gore-Tex patch as a last-resort measure to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP) in uncontrollable brain swelling during decompressive craniectomy (DC). Here, we report our experience and outcome in a consecutive series of patients undergoing DC with skin augmentation (DCDS).
   METHODS: In 2009-2015, a prospective database was created registering all patients who underwent DCDS when ICP increased >25 mm Hg while approximating the skin edges after DC (or when closing the skin was impossible because of uncontrollable brain swelling in patients without an ICP monitoring catheter). Patients' baseline characteristics and 1-year outcome were compared with patients undergoing DC without the need of skin augmentation in the same time frame. Outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was dichotomized into favorable (GOS score 4-5) and unfavorable (GOS 1-3).
   RESULTS: Of a total of 180 consecutive patients with DC, 20 (11%) underwent DCDS. Four (20%) survived favorably, 2 (10%) unfavorably, and 14 (70%) died (compared with 36%, 22%, and 42%, respectively, in patients with standard DC). Four of 7 patients in whom DCDS was performed >= 24 hours after injury or at second surgery survived favorably, versus none of the 13 patients in whom DCDS was performed < 24 hours after injury and at first surgery. Two of 10 patients surviving the first week after DCDS had a skinplasty-related infection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive craniectomy with skin augmentation may be used as a last-resort measure in cases of severe brain swelling despite DC.

   PATTERN
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal metastases pose significant morbidity. For many histologies, the spine is a frequent site for bone metastases. This predilection is not fully understood, and there are conflicting reports regarding the distribution within the vertebral body itself. Knowing this distribution will give clues as to the underlying biologic reason for this increased incidence in the spine and lead to a better understanding of tumor dispersion and growth.
   METHODS: We retrospectively examined magnetic resonance imaging scans of patients undergoing radiation to the spine from 2015 to 2017 for spinal metastases. The anatomical distribution of lesions was categorized. Lesions were sorted along the sagittal plane into 5 groups: anterior only, anterior + middle, middle only, posterior + middle, and posterior only. Lesions that covered all groups were discarded. chi(2) and post-hoc analyses were used for statistical analyses.
   RESULTS: Three hundred metastatic lesions were examined in 89 patients; 203 lesions were used for analysis. Sixty-five percent of all lesions were found in posterior only and posterior + middle aspects of the vertebral body (P < 0.0001). This localization was significant regardless of histology: lung (67%, P < 0.0001), kidney (66%, P < 0.0001), sarcoma (67%, P < 0.0001), prostate (63%, P = 0.01), and breast (63%, P = 0.01). This was consistent across thoracic (ii = 96) and lumbar (n = 63) regions (72% and 64%, respectively, P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic lesions of the thoracolumbar spine have a greater propensity to localize to the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. These data support the hypothesis that there may he differences within the vertebral body leading to differential tumor dispersion and growth.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of a staphylococcal decolonization regimen (SDR) and change in antibiotic prophylaxis regimen on postoperative meningitis (bacterial and aseptic) rates in patients undergoing elective cranial surgery.
   METHODS: Data on elective craniotomy (supratentorial and infratentorial) were collected retrospectively for a total of 4 years-2 years before (2011-2012; group A) and 2 years after (2014-2015; group B) initiation of a SDR and a change in the antibiotic prophylaxis regimen (from chloramphenicol to ceftriaxone) in a neurosurgical unit of a tertiary care hospital. The SDR consisted of a 4% chlorhexidine scrub bath once a day and 10% betadine ointment application intranasally twice daily for >= 2 days before surgery.
   RESULTS: A total of 1349 patients (GROUP A, n = 622; group B, n = 727) were included in the present study, of whom 806 (59.7%) were males. Of the 1349 patients, 43 (3.2%) developed postoperative meningitis. Of these 43 patients, 8 (0.6%) had bacterial meningitis (BM) and 35 (2.6%) had aseptic meningitis (AM). A reduction occurred in the incidence of both BM and AM in group B; however, the reduction was statistically significant only for AM (P = 0.48 for BM; P = 0.019 for AM). Multivariate analysis showed that the initiation of an SDR conferred a significant protective effect against developing postoperative AM (relative risk, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.70; P = 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that the incidence of AM can be reduced with an SDR and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. These findings lend support to the suspicion that AM might be a form of low-grade BM possibly due to a staphylococcal infection.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EETS) is a common treatment for patients with pituitary adenomas (PAs). A disadvantage of endoscopic surgery has been the lack of stereoscopic vision and depth perception. Recent developments offer high-definition 3-dimensional (3D-HD) visualization with a higher resolution and better image quality compared with 3D standard endoscopy (3D-SD). In this study, we compared treatment results of surgically treated patients with PAs using 3 different visualization systems: 2-dimensional (2D)-HD, 3D-SD, and 3D-HD.
   METHODS: Data from patients with primary PAs that were surgically treated between December 2008 and December 2017 were analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative tumor size and location, perioperative complications, and ophthalmologic, endocrine, and clinical outcomes were compared.
   RESULTS: A total of 170 patients underwent endoscopic resection of a primary PA (54 patients with 2D-HD, 75 with 3D-SD, and 41 with 3D-HD). Preoperatively, no statistical differences were found for tumor size, extension, and endocrine and ophthalmologic status. Tumor resection was not statistically different among the 3 groups. Complete resection was performed in 33 patients (80%) in the 3D-HD group, 54 patients (72%) in the 3D-SD group, and 39 patients (72%) in the 2D-HD group. The number of complications was not different across the groups (P = 0.436). Ophthalmologic outcomes did not differ based on EETS technique. The rate of new pituitary insufficiency was slightly lower in the 3D-HD group compared with 2D-HD and 3D-SD groups (4.8%, 16.6%, and 12%, respectively; P = 0.290).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the resection rate was higher in the 3D-HD group, and subjective advantages of the 3D-HD endoscopes were noted, there were no significant differences in terms of gross total resection or new hormonal deficits among the 3 groups.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade V subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) mostly have a poor outcome. Correct identification of patients who might benefit from treatment remains challenging. We investigated which disease-related characteristics, present at admission, could identify patients with chance of good outcome.
   METHODS: In total, 146 consecutive patients with WFNS grade V SAH (2002-2013) were included. Demographic and disease-related characteristics were compared between patients with a good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 4 and 5) and a poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 1-3). Subgroups were made of patients with aneurysm treatment according to outcome; 1) good outcome; 2) poor outcome, with optimal general treatment; and 3) poor outcome, general treatment discontinued.
   RESULTS: In total, 34 of the 146 patients had a good outcome (36% of all treated patients); 16 (47%) of these presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, versus 65 (58%) of patients with a poor outcome (P = 0.33). Eleven (33%) patients in the good outcome group presented with pupillary abnormalities; 4 (12%) even had bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils, versus 49 (46%) in patients with a poor outcome (P < 0.01). In 51 patients, the aneurysm was not treated; all died.
   CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of all treated patients with WFNS grade V SAH had a good outcome. All patients in whom the aneurysm was not treated died. Reliable identification of patients who will reach good outcome, on the basis of symptoms on admission, seems impossible, as these symptoms are not discriminating enough.

AB BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment strategy for ruptured intracranial dissecting aneurysms involving essential vessels remains controversial. The aim of this study was to review the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment at our center.
   METHODS: A total of 11 ruptured intracranial dissecting aneurysms involving branching arteries or arising from a major intracranial vessel without tolerance of parental artery occlusion were treated consecutively using endovascular techniques from January 2013 through December 2017. The lesions involved 4 internal carotid arteries, 2 basilar arteries, 3 vertebral arteries, and 2 posterior cerebral arteries. Clinical outcome and complications were evaluated retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Nine patients were initially treated by stent-assisted coiling, whereas 2 underwent initial coil embolization followed by stent-assisted coiling. Five patients required additional treatment because of rebleeding in 2 patients and re-expansion of the aneurysm in 3 patients. Anatomic preservation of parental, branching, and perforating arteries was successful in all patients, but thromboembolic complications related to an involved vessel occurred in 1 patient. After a mean follow-up period of 36 months (range, 10-63 months), the clinical outcome was good (modified Rankin scale score 0-2) in 9 patients, whereas 2 patients had a poor outcome (modified Rankin scale: 3 and 5) because of vasospasm-related delayed cerebral infarction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Careful follow-up is necessary after endovascular coiling for ruptured dissecting aneurysm involving essential vessels. Although additional treatment might be required, stent-assisted coiling could be a less invasive and feasible method for handling these difficult lesions.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence and distribution of abnormal vertebral pedicles in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) in Chinese people.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed AIS patients at a single institution between 2011 and 2017. Transverse pedicle widths from T1 to L5 were measured carefully using computed tomography, including cancellous and cortical channels. Pedicle morphology was classified as: type A, a cancellous channel larger than 4 mm; type B, a cancellous channel measuring 2-4 mm; type C, a cancelIons channel smaller than 2 mm with an entirely cortical channel of 2 mm or greater; or type D, a cortical channel smaller than 2 mm. Types B, C, and D were defined as abnormal. Prevalence and distribution of abnormal pedicles were assessed.
   RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with AIS, with a total of 2958 vertebral pedicles, were carefully measured and classified. The total prevalence of abnormal vertebral pedicles was as high as 65%, with type B comprising 40%, type C comprising 23%, and type D comprising 2%. Pedicles were located between T2 and T10 in 84% of type C and 91% of type D cases. Female sex, proximal thoracic location, major curve greater than 70 degrees, and concave pedicle may be risk factors for type C and D pedicles.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a significantly high prevalence of abnormal pedicles in AIS in Chinese people, with a total prevalence of 65%. Female sex, proximal thoracic location, major curve greater than 70 degrees, and concave pedicle may be risk factors for type C and D pedicles.

AB OBJECTIVE: The optimal surgical treatment for cavernous malformation-related temporal lobe epilepsy (CRTLE) is still controversial because it frequently involves the hippocampus as an epileptogenic zone. Here we describe our unique surgical strategy of performing hippocampal transection (HT) plus tumor resection for CRTLE to solve the question of how to balance postoperative seizure outcomes and neuropsychologic outcomes.
   METHODS: From 2005 to 2016, 7 cases of HT (3 on dominant side) plus tumor resection were performed for patients with CRTLE. We routinely perform intraoperative electrocorticography just before and after the resection of the tumor with hemosiderin rim. In cases with residual spikes from the hippocampus after the resection, we add HT, considering laterality of the lesion, preoperative memory functions, and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in hippocampi. Patient information, including seizure outcomes and preoperative and postoperative (24 months) Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), were collected.
   RESULTS: In the mean follow-up of 62.7 months (range 20-119), the postoperative seizure outcome was as follows: Engel class I in 6 cases (85.7%) and II in 1 case (14.3%). Perioperative changes in WMS-R score were as follows: 93.5 preoperatively versus 99.5 postoperatively (P = 0.408) in verbal memory and 90.7 versus 98.0 (P = 0.351) in delayed recall. Overall, no patient presented with more than 25% decline in any of the WMS-R indices postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small sample size and noncontrolled study design, postoperative seizure outcomes were deemed acceptable with favorable memory outcomes, which rather improved postoperatively with marginal statistical significance. In patients with CRTLE, additional HT is a reasonable treatment option.

AB OBJECTIVES: Dilatation of the superficial temporal artery (STA) and middle meningeal artery (MMA) were occasionally observed after bypass surgery for moyamoya angiopathy. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between angiographic outcomes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically focusing on the postoperative dilatation ratio of the STA (rSTA) and MMA (rMMA).
   METHODS: Fifty-six hemispheres in 36 consecutive patients who underwent revascularization for moyamoya angiopathy were evaluated. All patients underwent angiography and MRI before surgery and during the chronic phase. Angiographic outcomes were classified as good or poor according to the extent of the blood supply through direct or indirect bypass. The rSTA and rMMA was calculated in time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The signal changes of ivy signs and flow voids in basal ganglia were also evaluated.
   RESULTS: Postoperative collaterals through direct and indirect bypass was good in 30 (53.6%) and 33 (58.9%) patients, respectively. The mean rSTA and rMMA were 36.04 +/- 28.79% and 29.15 +/- 22.01%, respectively. Ivy signs and flow voids were decreased in 9 (16.1%) and 26 (46.4%) patients, respectively. Univariate analyses demonstrated no significant correlation between the angiographic outcomes and postoperative signal changes on MRI. However, rSTA was significantly correlated with good collaterals through direct bypass (P = 0.04), whereas rMMA was significantly correlated with good collaterals through indirect bypass (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: MRA may be an alternative to angiography. Both rSTA and rMMA estimated the development of collaterals after bypass surgery for moyamoya angiopathy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis is an established treatment for moyamoya disease. However, hemorrhagic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) leads to poor outcomes. This study aimed to identify predictors of hemorrhagic CHS based on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with moyamoya disease.
   METHODS: The study included 251 hemispheres in 155 patients with moyamoya disease who underwent preoperative and postoperative rCBF measurements and superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery double anastomosis. We used rCBF increase rate for predicting hemorrhagic CHS. rCBF increase rate was calculated by 2 methods. In method 1, the rCBF value on the operated side was compared with the rCBF value on the nonoperated side. In method 2, the postoperative rCBF value on the operated side was compared with the preoperative rCBF value on the operated side. Patients were classified into 4 groups according to rCBF increase rate to predict risk of hemorrhagic CHS.
   RESULTS: Hemorrhagic CHS occurred in 7 (2.8%) hemispheres (no children). Severe hemorrhagic CHS occurred in only 1 (0.4%) hemisphere. Hemorrhagic CHS was observed in patients with >= 30% rCBF increase according to method 1 and >= 50% rCBF increase according to method 2 and was most frequently noted in >= 100% rCBF increase.
   CONCLUSIONS: Predictors for hemorrhagic CHS were >= 30% rCBF increase when using method 1 and >= 50% increase when using method 2.

ID INTRACRANIAL MENINGIOMAS; 30-DAY MORBIDITY; MORTALITY; SCORE; INDEX
AB BACKGROUND: Older patients are increasingly presenting for surgery with intracranial meningioma because of progress with diagnostic imaging and longer life expectancy. However, older patients have many problems, such as comorbidities and reduced physiological capacity reflected in the frailty index. This study examines the factors affecting clinical deterioration after surgery in older patients, particularly factors associated with frailty.
   METHODS: Two hundred sixty-five patients older than 65 years underwent surgical resection of meningioma at Hiroshima University and related hospitals between 2000 and 2016. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scores before and after surgery were evaluated. Factors related to the deterioration of KPS were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression modeling, including body mass index and serum albumin.
   RESULTS: KPS score deteriorated compared with preoperative score in 56 patients at discharge and in 40 patients at 3 months later, and 2 patients died within 1 year after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis in addition to preoperative body mass index and serum albumin indicated skull base tumor location (odds ratio [OR], 4.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.02-10.8) and serum albumin (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.06-5.34) were risk factors for deterioration of KPS score at discharge. Age (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98), skull base tumor location (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.45-12.9), tumor size (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05), and serum albumin (OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.29-9.61) were significant risk factors for perioperative intracranial complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Skull base tumor location and serum albumin correlated with deterioration of clinical status after surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes requires stereotactic imaging. Stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for DBS surgery has become more popular and intraoperative MRI scanners have become more available. We report on our cohort of movement disorder patients who underwent intraoperative stereotactic MRI-only DBS electrode implantation.
   METHODS: A review of our DBS database for eligible patients over a study period of 8 years was performed. Stereotactic accuracy was calculated as a directional error and the Euclidean distance between planned and controlled electrode positions. Number and choice of microelectrodes, procedural times and complications were documented.
   RESULTS: n = 86 surgeries in n = 81 patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), essential tremor and dystonia were performed and n = 167 electrodes were implanted. Mean Euclidean distance between planned and controlled target was 2.1mm (+/- 0.6). The directional error showed that electrodes were implanted more medial (0.3mm +/- 0.9), posterior (0.5mm +/- 1.0) and inferior (0.6mm +/- 1.0) compared to plan. There were no significant differences for stereotactic accuracy between targets, hemispheres or order of implantation. No significant correlations between Euclidean distance and number of microelectrode tracts or volume of intracranial air were observed. N = 539 microelectrodes were applied. In 28.7% non-center trajectories were chosen. Length of tremor (-61 minutes) and PD (-121 minutes) surgeries could be reduced significantly over the course of the study period. N = 1 (1.2%) intracranial hemorrhage occurred. N = 1 (0.6%) electrode had to be repositioned for lack of clinical effect.
   CONCLUSION: Intraoperative stereotactic MRI for DBS surgery is feasible with high stereotactic accuracy and low rates of complication.

ID SURGICAL-TREATMENT; ANATOMY
AB OBJECTIVE: To describe our experiences with microsurgical treatment of unruptured anterior choroidal artery (AchA) aneurysms, and to evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for procedure-related complications.
   METHODS: The study included 110 patients treated between January 2012 and December 2016. All patients met the following criteria: 1) microsurgical treatment of an unruptured AchA aneurysm was performed; and 2) clinical and radiographic follow-up data were available, including findings from preoperative digital subtraction angiography. The incidence of and risk factors for procedure-related complications were retrospectively evaluated. The chi(2) test and Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis, and univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted.
   RESULTS: Procedure-related complications occurred in 5 patients (4.5%), including symptomatic complications in 4 patients (3.6%) and asymptomatic complications in 1 patient (0.9%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the angle between the vertical line to the cranial base and the axis of the communicating segment of the internal carotid artery (MiC angle) (odds ratio [011], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-5.26; P = 0.038) and the angle between the projection line of the aneurysmal dome and the axis of the communicating segment of the internal carotid artery (DC angle) (OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.49-11.7; P = 0.014) were independent risk factors for procedure-related complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: When microsurgical treatment of unruptured AchA aneurysms was performed, the procedure-related complication rate was 4.5%. Patients with AchA aneurysms with a smaller MiC angle and smaller DC angle may be at a higher risk of procedure-related complications when undergoing microsurgical treatment.

ID MOTOR SYSTEM; LANGUAGE; ORGANIZATION; ATTENTION; MODEL
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although many studies have investigated functional localization by electrical stimulation, the threshold to identify each area remains controversial. The present study aimed to elucidate the threshold of a cortical stimulation for functional mapping.
   METHODS: We analyzed data from 17 patients with medically intractable epilepsy who underwent a 50-Hz electrical cortical stimulation for functional mapping between October 2013 and May 2017. The symptoms induced by the stimulation and the thresholds of the stimulation for these responses were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Motor responses were observed after the stimulation of the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, and frontal eye field, and sensory responses after the stimulation of the primary and secondary sensory cortex. Regarding negative responses, language impairment was observed after the stimulation of the anterior, posterior, and basal temporal language areas, negative motor responses after the stimulation of the premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and the pre- supplementary motor area, and an impairment in spatial recognition after the stimulation of the right posterior parietal cortex. Negative or positive auditory symptoms were observed with the stimulation of the posterior superior temporal gyrus. The thresholds for positive phenomena were significantly lower than those for negative phenomena (Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.01), and sensory responses were induced at significantly lower intensities than motor responses (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Positive and sensory effects are induced by lower intensities than negative and motor responses, respectively. The present results provide not only a practical guide for functional mapping, but also a hierarchal concept of processing in the brain.

AB BACKGROUND: Chordomas are locally invasive slow-growing tumors that are difficult to study because of the rarity of the tumors and the lack of significant volumes of patients with longitudinal follow-up. As such, there are currently no machine learning studies in the chordoma literature. The purpose of this study was to develop machine learning models for survival prediction and deploy them as open access web applications as a proof of concept for machine learning in rare nervous system lesions.
   METHODS: The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database was used to identify adult patients diagnosed with spinal chordoma between 1995 and 2010. Four machine learning models were used to predict 5-year survival for spinal chordoma and assessed by discrimination, calibration, and overall performance.
   RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival for 265 patients with spinal chordoma was 67.5%. Variables used for prediction were age at diagnosis, tumor size, tumor location, extent of tumor invasion, and extent of surgery. For 5-year survival prediction, the Bayes Point Machine achieved the best performance with a c statistic of 0.80, calibration slope of 1.01, calibration intercept of 0.03, and Brier score of 0.16. This model for 5-year mortality prediction was incorporated into an open access application and can be found online (https://sorg-apps. shinyapps. io/chordoma/).
   CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of patients with spinal chordoma demonstrated that machine learning models can be developed for survival prediction in rare pathologies and have the potential to serve as the basis for creation of decision support tools in the future.

AB OBJECTIVE: Advanced magnetic resonance imaging I) acquisition methods such as 4D phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D pcMRI) have found widespread applications in assessing hemodynamics in cerebral aneurysms. One of the goals is the identification of a hemodynamic scenario predictive of aneurysm rupture. Because of the technical complexity the 4D pcMRI technology, challenges exist in extracting and communicating the wealth of information contained in the MRI image data, in particular, to a multidisciplinary team of health professionals and basic scientists.
   METHODS: Here we introduce a new resource in the An of a commercially available optical see-through headmounted display, which allows augmenting the real world by computer-generated virtual objects.
   RESULTS: An image processing algorithm was prefor integrating 3D surface models derived from 3D rotational angiography data, 3D time-of-flight MRI data, and 4D pcMRI data into the augmented reality environment This new approach was successfully evaluated on blood flow data acquired before and after flow diverter treatment in 6 patients harboring a cerebral aneurysm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Augmented reality may become an additional means for visualizing complex medical data, in particular complex flows as illustrated here.

AB BACKGROUND: Adamkiewicz arteries vasospasm in spinal cord subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can affect the spinal cord. Although muscle dysfunction of extremities is a common problem after spinal cord ischemia induced by SAH, to our knowledge there are no studies on degenerative changes in peripheral nerves. We studied the histopathologic changes in sciatic nerves after spinal SAH.
   METHODS: This study was carried out on 19 rabbits. Five of them were used as control animals, 5 were in the sham group, and 9 were in the study group. For the procedure, 0.5 cm(3) of serum saline for the sham group and autologous arterial blood for the study group was injected into the lumbar subarachnoid space at the L5 level. After 2 weeks of follow-up, the sciatic nerve roots at the L5-S3 levels with spinal cords and sciatic nerves were bilaterally extracted to the levels of the collum femoris. The specimens were evaluated by stereologic methods, and degenerated sciatic nerve axons were estimated by Cavalieri methods. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for data analysis. Differences of P < 0.005 were evaluated as significant.
   RESULTS: The mean number of degenerated axon density per square millimeter of sciatic nerve at the collum femoris level was 7 +/- 2/mm(2) in the control group, 23 +/- 7/mm(2) in the sham group (P < 0.005), and 125 +/- 32/ mm(2) in the SAH group (P < 0.00005). Statistical analysis showed that spinal SAH may cause axonal degeneration in the peripheral nerves.
   CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that SAHs frequently affect the spinal cord and result in axonal injury to peripheral nerves, of which there is no mention in the literature.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and radiographic outcomes and complications after vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) for osteoporotic vertebral fractures with severe collapse.
   METHODS: Patients >65 years old with single osteoporotic vertebral fracture (T10-L2) with severe collapse (>40%) were prospectively enrolled and allocated to either KP or VP. Visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index were used for clinical assessment. Vertebral height loss (HL) and segmental kyphotic angle were measured radiographically at preoperative; postoperative; and 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month postoperative time points. Procedure-related and postoperative complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: Forty-six patients (27 with VP, 19 with KP) were enrolled. Visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores were similar at all time points in the 2 groups. Complication rates were also similar. HL and kyphotic angle were restored significantly in both groups. KP showed a better result in HL (KP group HL 20.5% +/- 5.6% vs. VP group HL 29.8% +/- 4.6%, P< 0.001). Progressive vertebral HL was observed, and patients with KP showed a greater collapse in height. At 1-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in vertebral height (KP group HL 29.8% +/- 6.3% vs. VP group HL 33.0% +/- 5.2%, P = 0.075).
   CONCLUSIONS: KP and VP showed similar improvements in pain and disability during treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Although vertebral height and segmental kyphotic angle were restored significantly in both groups, progressive vertebral HL was inevitable, especially after KP. This likely resulted from the difference of bone-cement interface as a consequence of balloon tamping in KP. Surgeons must consider the respective features of vertebral augmentations.

TI The Incidence of Hydrocephalus and Shunting in Patients with
   Angiogram-Negative Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: An Updated Meta-Analysis

DT Article

   PATTERNS; OUTCOMES; SERIES
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of hydrocephalus and implanted shunts in angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) according to hemorrhage patterns: perimesencephalic SAH (PMH) versus non-PMH.
   METHODS: The online database literature from January 1990 to November 2017 was systematically reviewed. A fixed-effect model was used when heterogeneity was <50%. A Begg funnel plot was used to assess publication bias. An additional trim and fill method was used to estimate the number of missing studies. A subgroup analysis with studies, which defined angiogram-negative SAH using repeated angiography or computed tomography angiography, was further performed.
   RESULTS: A total of 28 articles including 2577 patients were enrolled. Patients with PMH showed a significantly decreased incidence of hydrocephalus (odds ratio [011], 0.269; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.208-0.348) and shunts (OR, 0.263; 95% CI, 0.169-0.411) than did patients without PMH. A subgroup analysis of 7 studies with 675 patients showed less hydrocephalus in patients with PMH than in patients without PMH (OR, 0.358; 95% CI, 0.161-0.793), with possible publication bias. Shunt procedures were marginally less common in patients with PMH compared with those patients without PMH (OR, 0.490; 95% CI, 0.236-1.018) with possible publication bias. After correction of the forest plot, the adjusted OR was 0.617 (95% CI, 0.251-1.513) for hydrocephalus and 0.618 (95% CI, 0.310-1.232) for shunts, suggesting no significant relationships between PMH and the risk of hydrocephalus or shunting.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hydrocephalus and shunts were more evident in non-PMH than PMH. However, subgroup analyses did not show significant associations between PMH and lower risks of these events after correction for possible publication bias. Further meta-analyses based on individual patient data are necessary.

AB OBJECTIVE: The literature on surgical management of atypical hangman's fracture (AHF) is sparse. The aim of this study was to describe an individual surgical strategy using a lag screw-rod technique for treatment of unstable AHF based on different fracture patterns.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 23 patients with unstable AHF was performed. Fractures were classified into 3 patterns: A, 1 fracture line through 1 side of C2 body obliquely and another through pars interarticularis on the other side; B, 1 fracture line through 1 side of C2 body obliquely and another through contralateral lamina; C, bilateral oblique fracture lines through posterior cortex of C2 on different sides. Posterior C2-C3 pedicle screw fixation and fusion using a lag screw-rod technique with different surgical strategies for each fracture pattern was used for all patients. Complications, neck pain, neurologic status, reduction of anterior translation and angulation between C2 and C3, and fusion rate were evaluated.
   RESULTS: No technique-related complications (e.g., spinal cord or nerve injury caused by malposition of screws) occurred. Mean follow-up time was 37 months. Satisfactory reduction and bony union were demonstrated on postoperative radiographs. Neck pain and neurologic deficits caused by C2 injury improved significantly in all patients after operation. No graft or implant-related complications were observed in patients during the entire follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using individual surgical strategies based on different fracture patterns, the posterior C2-C3 lag screw-rod technique may be an effective and reliable option for unstable AHF.

AB OBJECTIVE: Selecting optimal strategies for improving fixation in osteoporotic lumbar spine is an important issue in clinical research. Cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screws have been proven to enhance screw pull-out strength, but biomechanical efficacy of these screws remains understudied. The aim of this study was to evaluate biomechanical efficacy of CBT screws in osteoporotic lumbar spine.
   METHODS: Thirty-one vertebrae from 14 cadaveric lumbar spines were obtained. All specimens were measured by computed tomography; the diameter of pedicles, excluding those of vertebral bodies with very small pedicle developments, was calculated. After measuring bone mineral density, the CBT screw was randomly inserted into 1 side, and the traditional trajectory (TT) screw was inserted into the contralateral side. Maximum insertional torque was recorded after screw insertion. Of vertebrae, 21 were subjected to pullout testing at a rate of 5 mm/minute, and 10 were subjected to cyclic fatigue testing. Each construct was loaded until exceeding 5 mm.
   RESULTS: Average bone mineral density was 0.567 + 0.101 g/cm(2). CBT screws had higher maximum insertional torque (degrees of freedom = 30, t = 5.78, P< 0.001, 0.333 Nm vs. 0.188 N-m) and higher axial pullout strength (degrees of freedom = 20, t = 7.41, P < 0.001, 394 N vs. 241 N) than TT screws. Increased bone mineral density was not significantly associated with higher pullout load. Compared with TT screws, CBT screws showed better resistance to fatigue testing and required more cycles to exceed 5 mm (degrees of freedom = 9, t = 5.62, P< 0.001, 6161 cycles vs. 3639 cycles). Failure load for displacing screws was also significantly greater for CBT screws than for TT screws (degrees of freedom = 9, t = 5.75, P< 0.001, 4 1 13 N vs. 317 N).
   CONCLUSIONS: CBT screws had better biomechanical fixation in osteoporotic lumbar spine compared with standard pedicle screws.

AB OBJECTIVE: Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) at the petrous apex are rare but may cause subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or severe brainstem edema. This study aimed to summarize their clinical features and discuss the classification.
   METHODS: During a 15-year period, 64 consecutive patients with DAVF at the petrous apex were reviewed. According to their angioarchitecture, these cases were classified as follows: type I, no venous ectasia (48.4%); type II, venous ectasia but with normal vein proximal to the fistula (29.7%); and type III, venous ectasia at the site of the fistula (21.9%).
   RESULTS: There were 53 men and 11 women included. Presented symptoms were SAH in 8 patients (12.5%), nonhemorrhagic neurologic defects (NHNDs) in 53 patients (82.8%), and no symptoms in 3 patients (4.7%). There were 49 patients who received transarterial embolization, 8 patients who received microsurgery, and 7 patients who received embolization and microsurgery. Complications occurred in 9 patients (14.1%), including transient cranial nerve palsy (4.7%), rebleeding (6.3%), and respiratory failure (3.1%). Of the type I patients, 96.77% presented with NHNDs and 77.42% presented with infratentorial drainage. However, SAH occurred more often in type II (21.05%)/type III cases (28.57%), and most patients carried a supratentorial drainage (63.16% and 85.71%, respectively). In different types of DAVFs, the necessity for embolization combined with microsurgery (6.45% in type I, 10.53% in type II, 21.43% in type III) and the occurrence of rebleeding complications (0% in type I, 10.53% in type II, and 14.29% in type III) were varied.
   CONCLUSIONS: Petrous apex DAVFs carried a high risk of embolization-related complications. Based on the vascular architecture, this classification may reflect their clinical features and provide some advice on the treatment of DAVFs at the petrous apex.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the facet joint violation (FJV) impacts clinical outcomes after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
   METHODS: Patients undergoing bilateral PKP were enrolled and divided into FJV and non-FJV groups depending on their postoperative axial computed tomography scans. Radiologic parameters, visual analogue scale (VAS), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were obtained preoperatively and each follow-up time postoperatively (1day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year). Finally, patient satisfaction surveys also were noted.
   RESULTS: A total of 157 patients completed the 1-year follow-up. The incidence of FJV resulting from puncture trocars was 15.9% (25/157). Approximately 5.7% (9/157) and 10.2% (16/157) of patients were considered to have grade 1 and grade 2 violation, respectively. PKP decreased the VAS and ODI scores compared with the preoperative values in both groups. Patients with FJV had much greater VAS and ODI scores than did those without FJV at 1-day, 1-week, and 1-month follow-up. No significant differences were found between groups at 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year follow up. Patients in the FJV group were less satisfied with the surgical outcomes than were those without FJV at the last survey.
   CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 15.9% of patients were diagnosed with FJV by postoperative computed tomography scans. FJV had a negative influence on clinical outcomes after PKP in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, primarily at short-term follow-up. In addition, FJV was also a risk factor in the long-term surgical satisfaction.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the radiologic and clinical outcomes between oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) without laminectomy and minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI-TLIF).
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Between April 2012 and January 2017, 25 patients in each of the MI-TLIF and OLIF groups were recruited as matched pairs. Clinical outcomes included visual analogue scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and satisfaction rates. Radiographic outcomes comprised disc height (DH) and fusion status. Intraoperative data and complications were collected. All patients completed the clinical and radiologic outcomes. Outcomes were compared preoperatively and postoperatively.
   RESULTS: Matched pairs were compared between 2 groups in terms of demographic data and preoperative measurements; less blood loss and shorter operative time were found in OLIF versus MI-TLIF (P < 0.001). The total complication rate was 36% in OLIF and 32% in MI-TLIF (P = 0.77). The outcomes of visual analogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index were significantly improved in both groups, and there was no significant difference between 2 groups. Satisfaction rates of the both groups were more than 90%. OLIF was superior to MI-TLIF with respect its capability to restore DH (P < 0.001). Earlier time of fusion was observed in OLIF (80%) compared with MI-TLIF (52%) at 6 months (P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: OLIF may achieve equivalent clinical and radiologic outcomes compared with MI-TLIF when the stenosis is minimal because the decompression performed is indirect. Furthermore, the OLIF shows less blood loss and shorter operative time, better restoration of DH, and earlier time to fusion than the MI-TLIF.

AB OBJECTIVE: Amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) using O-(2[F-1(8)]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) provides important additional information on the extent of viable tumor tissue of glioblastoma compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Especially after radio-chemotherapy, progression of contrast enhancement in MRI is equivocal and may represent either tumor progression or treatment-related changes. Here, the first case comparing postmortem whole-brain histology of a patient with pretreated glioblastoma with dynamic in vivo FET PET and MRI is presented.
   METHODS: A 61-year-old patient with glioblastoma initially underwent partial tumor resection and died 11 weeks after completion of chemoradiation with concurrent temozolomide. Three days before the patient died, a followup FET PET and MRI scan indicated tumor progression. Autopsy was performed 48 hours after death. After formalin fixation, a 7-cm bihemispherical segment of the brain containing the entire tumor mass was cut into 3500 consecutive 20 mu m coronal sections. Representative sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain, cresyl violet, and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry. An experienced neuropathologist identified areas of dense and diffuse neoplastic infiltration, astrogliosis, and necrosis. In vivo FET PET, MRI datasets, and postmortem histology were co-registered and compared by 3 experienced physicians.
   RESULTS: Increased uptake of FET in the area of equivocal contrast enhancement on MRI correlated very well with dense infiltration by vital tumor cells and showed tracer kinetics typical for malignant gliomas. An area of predominantly reactive astrogliosis showed only moderate uptake of FET and tracer kinetics usually observed in benign lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report impressively documents the correct imaging of a progressive glioblastoma by FET PET.

AB OBJECTIVE: Posterior fossa tumor surgery is associated with a significant risk of complications, and the complications are typically more frequent compared with similar supratentorial surgeries. This study aimed to evaluate 1) the extent of resection and neurologic outcomes and 2) perioperative complications with use of minimally invasive approaches for intra-axial posterior fossa tumors from our case series.
   METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent nonbiopsy surgery of a posterior fossa tumor using tubular retractors and exoscopic visualization from January 2016 to May 2018 were prospectively identified and included.
   RESULTS: During the reviewed period, 15 patients underwent resection of an intra-axial posterior fossa tumor. Eight (53%) patients were men, and the median age was 63.0 years (interquartile range: 45.0-67.5 years). The tumor was located in the cerebellar hemisphere in 11 (73%) cases, vermis in 3 (20%) cases, and middle cerebellar peduncle in 1 (7%) case. The median preoperative and postoperative lesion volumes were 21.6 cm(3) (interquartile range: 10.1-33.0 cm(3)) and 0 cm(3) (interquartile range: 0-1.2 cm(3)), respectively. The percent resection was 100% (92%-100%). Following surgery, 12 (80%) patients had improved and 3 (20%) patients had stable Karnofsky performance scale scores, whereas no patients had a decline in Karnofsky performance scale score postoperatively. No patients incurred other postoperative regional or medical complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the possible efficacy of a minimally invasive approach with the use of tubular retractors and exoscopic visualization for resecting posterior fossa intra-axial tumors with relatively high efficacy and low morbidity.

AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric high-grade brainstem gliomas are aggressive tumors with dismal prognoses. Large-scale studies are needed to further characterize these tumors and determine factors influencing cancer-specific mortality and survival at varying time points.
   METHODS: We used the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database to conduct a population-based study of pediatric patients with histologically confirmed anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma tumors located within the brainstem. Multivariate analyses incorporating patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatments were used to determine predictors of cancer-specific mortality and survival at 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years.
   RESULTS: We included 154 patients from the SEER database: 72 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (47%) and 82 (53%) with glioblastoma. Median survival for the entire cohort was 10.0 months. Glioblastoma histology, developmental stage, and large tumor size were significantly associated with cancer-specific mortality. Six-month, 9-month, 1-year, and 2-year survival was 75%, 57%, 42%, and 20%, respectively. Glioblastoma histology was associated with worsened survival at 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; P = 0.0081), 9 months (OR, 0.18; P < 0.001), 1 year (OR, 0.19; P < 0.001), and 2 years (OR, 0.14; P = 0.0055). Radiation therapy was associated with improved survival at 6 (OR, 8.53; P = 0.0012) and 9 months (OR, 3.58; P = 0.035) but not at 1 or 2 years. Radiation therapy was associated with improved survival in glioblastoma (9.0 vs. 3.0 months; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study showed that glioblastoma histology is associated with a poor prognosis in pediatric patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas. Regardless of histology, radiation therapy improved survival at 6 and 9 months but not long-term.

   BYPASS
AB BACKGROUND: The end-to-side anastomosis is 1 of the most common anastomosis configurations used in cerebrovascular surgery. Although several living practice models have been proposed for this technique, few involve purely arterial vessels. The purpose of the present study was to compare 2 arterial models using common carotid arteries (CCAs) and common iliac arteries (CIAs) in rats.
   METHODS: The CIAs and CCAs were exposed in 10 anesthetized rats, and their lengths and diameters were measured. Also, the mobilization extent of each vessel along its contralateral counterpart was measured after each artery had been transected at its proximal exposure point. We also studied the technical advantages and disadvantages of each model for practicing end-to-side anastomosis.
   RESULTS: The average diameters of the CCA and CIA were 1.1 and 1.3 mm, respectively. The average extent of mobilization along the contralateral vessel was 13.9 mm and 10.3 mm for CCA and CIA, respectively. The CCA model had the advantages of greater arterial redundancy (allowing completion of both suture lines extraluminally) and a minimal risk of venous injury. The main disadvantage of the CCA model was the risk of cerebral ischemia. The CIA model was not limited by the ischemic time and provided the technical challenge of microsurgical dissection of the common iliac vein from the CIA, although it had limited CIA redundancy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both CCA and CIA models could be efficiently used for practicing the end-to-side anastomosis technique. Each model provides the trainee with a specific set of advantages and disadvantages that could help with the optimal selection of the practice model according to trainee's skill level.

AB BACKGROUND: The greater auricular nerve (GAN) may be used as a nerve graft during neurosurgical procedures to repair damaged nerves. There is extensive literature on localization of the GAN at the posterior triangle of the neck, but objective information on localization of the GAN at the anterior triangle of the neck close to cranial neurosurgical fields is lacking. The aim of this study was to introduce simple and reliable landmarks to localize the GAN at the anterior triangle of the neck to facilitate its harvest during neurosurgical procedures.
   METHODS: The GAN was exposed bilaterally in 11 cadaveric specimens at the point of crossing the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (anterior greater auricular point (AGM). Distances from the AGA point to the angle of the mandible and the tip of the mastoid process were measured. Additionally, the location of the crossing point between the GAN and an imaginary line passing through the mastoid tip and the angle of the mandible (M-A line) was found relative to these bony landmarks.
   RESULTS: Mean (+/- SD) distances from the AGA point to and mastoid tip and the angle of the mandible were 29.1 +/- 3.4 mm and 27.5 +/- 4.5 mm, respectively. The GAN was always found to cross the M-A line in its middle third (mean 48.2% +/- 6.9% from the mastoid tip).
   CONCLUSIONS: The AGA point and the M-A line are reliable landmarks for locating the GAN at the anterior triangle of the neck and for helping neurosurgeons expose and harvest the GAN efficiently.

AB BACKGROUND: The subtemporal and orbitozygomatic approaches are the most commonly used surgical approaches for the treatment of basilar artery apex (BAX) aneurysms. Relative advantages and disadvantages are generally reported based on surgeons' experience. This study was performed to provide a detailed comparison between the subtemporal and orbitozygomatic approaches based on cadaveric dissection analysis for the treatment of BAX aneurysms.
   METHODS: Subtemporal and orbitozygomatic approaches were performed on 5 cadaveric heads (10 sides), and the following variables were assessed and compared between the 2 approaches: 1) number of exposed perforators on P-1-posterior cerebral arteries (PCA); 2) lengths of exposure and clipping for bilateral PCA, superior cerebellar arteries (SCA), and basilar trunk; 3) surgical area of exposure; and 4) surgical freedom at the BAX.
   RESULTS: Number of perforators exposed on P-1-PCA was not different between the subtemporal and orbitozygomatic approaches. Exposure and clipping of ipsilateral SCA and PCA were superior using the subtemporal approach, and better for contralateral SCA and PCA using the orbitozygomatic approach, all reaching statistical significance. The orbitozygomatic approach provided greater exposure and clipping length for the proximal basilar trunk. Although the surgical area of exposure was similar between the 2 approaches, the overall surgical freedom was greater in the orbitozygomatic approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: The orbitozygomatic approach provides a greater number of surgical corridors to the BAX and is superior regarding multiple surgically relevant anatomic parameters. Importantly, control over the basilar trunk and over the contralateral SCA and PCA (blind spots) is superior with the orbitozygomatic approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: The orbital cavity is an anatomically complex region and an area of interest of many specialists, each of whom is familiar with specific surgical approaches.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and outcome data of 70 patients who underwent surgery for resection of an orbital tumor with a mean follow-up of 111.9 +/- 79.6 months. The clinical outcome was reported and the role of sex, age, histology, tumor location, tumor size, and surgical approach on the extent of tumor removal was assessed.
   RESULTS: Total removal was achieved in 74.3%, subtotal removal in 20%, and partial removal in 5.7% of patients. A fronto-orbital craniotomy was used in 57.1% of cases, frontal approach in 17.1%, fronto-orbit-zygomatic approach in 10%, and endoscopic endonasal approach in 11.4%. Complications included visual acuity decrease (4.3%), cerebrospinal fluid leak (4.3%), nerve palsy (10%; supraorbital nerve 4.3%; frontal branches of facial nerve 2.9%, third cranial nerve 2.9%), and enophthalmos (1.4%). Lateral orbitotomy, combined fronto-orbital and maxillotomy, and trans-eyelid approaches were used in the remaining cases. The fronto-orbital, frontal, and lateral orbitotomy approaches were associated with greater rates of total resection as compared with the fronto-orbit-zygomatic approach, which was used in difficult cases in which the tumor involved several regions.
   CONCLUSIONS: We recommend, 1) the endoscopic endonasal approach for primary orbital tumors located in the medial or inferior orbital walls without extra-orbital extension; 2) the trans-eyelid approach for tumors of the upper and upper-lateral quadrants extraconally located, and 3) the fronto-orbital approach for intraconally located tumors involving more than one quadrant.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between the reliability of the transcranial or transcortical motor evoked potential (MEP) response and age in pediatric patients aged <= 15 years with brain tumor.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 60 consecutive patients aged <= 15 years who had undergone brain tumor surgery that involved intraoperative MEP monitoring from October 2009 to May 2016.
   RESULTS: A total of 41 patients with reliable signals (MEP response group) and 19 patients without reliable signals (MEP nonresponse group) were included in the present study. The mean age at surgery, body height, and body weight were significantly greater in the MEP response group than in the MEP nonresponse group. When the MEP success rates during surgery of the pediatric population with brain tumors were analyzed in relation to patient age, the transcortical MEP success rate in the 0-5-year age group (10.0%) was significantly lower than that in the 6-10-year age group (71.4%; P = 0.009) and that in the 11-15-year age group (75.0%; P = 0.015).
   CONCLUSIONS: The transcortical MEP response was monitored less successfully during brain tumor surgery in patients aged <= 5 years than in patients aged 6-15 years. Although MEP monitoring techniques can be applied during surgery of pediatric populations with brain tumors similar to that used for adult patients, the limitations of the low transcortical MEP response rate in young patients should be considered.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neurocognitive impairment is a frequent complication of moyamoya disease in adults, but the long-term outcomes of neurocognitive function remain unclear. We evaluated neurocognitive functions in a group of patients with a history of moyamoya disease and assessed the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and neurocognitive functions.
   METHODS: We studied 53 patients with a history of adult moyamoya disease. Neurocognitive functions were evaluated with the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (Cognistat) and the Frontal Assessment Battery. The relationship between rCBF and neurocognitive functions were assessed in patients for whom rCBF was measured using single-photon emission computed tomography with I-123-iodoamphetamine.
   RESULTS: Patients had a history of moyamoya disease for an average of 10.6 years, with 23 patients managed conservatively and 30 managed using revascularization. Attention, memory, conceptualization, mental flexibility, and inhibitory control were impaired but with no significant difference between conservatively and surgically treated patients. Posterior cerebral artery involvement and frontal lobe infarction were not associated with neuro-cognitive examination scores in nonrevascularized or revascularized patients. Orientation, comprehension, calculation, conceptualization, and sensitivity to interference correlated with rCBF in the left ventral middle cerebral artery territory (P < 0.01), whereas memory correlated with rCBF in the right dorsal anterior cerebral artery territory (P < 0.01). Conceptualization also correlated with rCBF in the left dorsal anterior cerebral artery territory (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that long-standing hypoperfusion in specific brain regions can cause related neurocognitive dysfunction even in mild moyamoya disease managed conservatively.

   TREATMENT; MERCI TRIAL; RECANALIZATION; REPERFUSION; METHODOLOGY;
   THERAPY; SCALES; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Within the Thromholysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) classification, TICI 2b has been historically considered successful recanalization. However, TICI 2b may result in worse functional outcomes compared with TICI 3 or a proposed TICI 2c revascularization grade. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in functional independence at 90 days between TICI 2b, 2c, and 3 grades.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 185 consecutive patients with anterior cerebral circulation occlusions was performed; 33 patients who were treated >8 hours after onset were excluded. Patient angiograms were graded by 2 experienced neurointerventional physicians. Baseline demographics and functional independence at 90 days were compared.
   RESULTS: Of 152 patients included in the study, 113 patients achieved TICI grade 2b (n = 37), 2c (n = 34), or 3 (n = 42). A significant difference in functional independence at 90 days was observed between TICI 2b and 2c/3 (P = 0.0008), between 2b and 2c (P = 0.0005), and between 2b and 3 (P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in functional independence between 2c and 3 (P = 0.24).
   CONCLUSIONS: TICI 2c revascularization is associated with significantly improved outcomes compared with TICI 2b revascularization and similar outcomes compared with TICI 3 revascularization. Using a TICI grading system that includes an additional TICI 2c grade or expands the current definition of TICI 3 allows for refined prediction of functional independence. Achieving TICI 2c/3 reperfusion should be considered during stroke thrombectomy.

AB BACKGROUND: Only a few case reports and case series exist reporting on primary chondrosarcomas of the spine. The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of this patient population and surgical techniques used for treatment.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in January 2018 querying several scientific databases, per PRISMA guidelines. Surgery type was categorized into en bloc, piecemeal excision, or non-en bloc or piecemeal excision.
   RESULTS: In total, 34 records and 3 patients were included in the systematic review, yielding 87 patients with primary chondrosarcoma of the spine. The mean age was 41.5 years, with the tumor most commonly arising in adult patients (90.8%, 79/87); most were male (66.7%, 58/87). Those who underwent piecemeal excision had the highest death rate (56.7%, P <= 0.001) and highest rate of recurrence (63.3%, P <= 0.001) compared with en bloc and non-en bloc or piecemeal excision. The calculated reduced relative risk (RR) comparing en bloc with the other surgical techniques for recurrence and mortality was 78.8% (RR, 0.21; P <= 0.001) and 80.7% (RR, 0.19; P <= 0.001), respectively. Survival analysis showed patients with a piecemeal excision had 9.4 times hazards ratio for death compared with en bloc (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: CS is a rare lesion that most commonly presents in adult male patients. En bloc surgical resection was associated with a significant decrease in recurrence, mortality, and increased survival compared with the other surgical techniques. In addition, any surgical technique that involved entering the tumor capsule showed a significantly greater risk for recurrence and death.

TI Endospine Surgery Complications in Lumbar Herniated Disc
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Complications intraoperatively and postoperatively; Endospine surgery;
   Lumbar disc herniation
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Spine surgery is entering a new era of evolution, with minimally invasive spine surgery to decompress the neural structures without affecting the stability of the spine. However, complications may occur. The surgeon must have these in mind in order to prevent them. We report on the main intraoperative and postoperative complications of endospine surgery of lumbar disc herniation.
   METHODS: It was a retrospective study spread over 22 years (January 1993 - December 2015) concerning 10,433 patients who underwent treatment for lumbar disc herniation at the Endospine Surgery Center Bordeaux France. Among them 1189 patients had 1 intraoperative or post-operative complication.
   RESULTS: This study comprised 10,433 patients, among whom 1189 had various complications, which represented 11.39%. The average age of this sample was 46 years, and the eldest were 91 years. A male predominance was noted in 6502 of cases with a sex ratio of 6502/3931 = 1.65. The complications were recurrences (6.77%) followed by dural tears (1.91%), facet resection (1.14%), two-level approach instead of one (1.09%), radicular lesion (0.17%) that remained with motor or pain symptoms, wrong level and infections such as spondylodiscitis and wound infection, respectively (0.08%) each, deep vein thrombosis (0.04%), and gauze (0.03%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-two years of follow-up on endospine treatment for lumbar disc herniation showed a low complication rate. An early and efficient management will nevertheless allow a good outcome in the majority of patients operated.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial-intracranial (IC-IC) bypass surgery involves the use of significant technical bimanual skills. Indications for this procedure are limited, so training in a simulator with brain vessels similarity could maintain microsurgical dexterity. Our goal is to describe the human placenta vascular anatomy to guide IC-IC bypasses apprenticeship.
   METHODS: Human placenta vascular anatomy was reeorted and validated with comparison to brain main vessels after studying the vascular tree of 100 placentas. Five simulated IC-IC bypasses (end to end, end to lateral, lateral to lateral, aneurysm bridge, and aneurysm exiting branch transposition) were developed and construct and concurrent validated. Statistical analysis using the t variance test was performed with a confidence interval of 0.95.
   RESULTS: A total of 1200 placenta vessels were used for test-retest validation with a reliability index of 0.95. All 100 human placentas were suitable to perform the 5 different bypasses. Construct validity showed a P < 0.005. Concurrent validity highlighted the technical differences among simulators.
   CONCLUSIONS: An ex vivo bypass model offers great similarity to main brain vessels with the possibility to practice a variety of IC-IC bypass techniques in a single simulator. Placenta vascular anatomy knowledge can improve laboratory microsurgical training.

AB BACKGROUND: Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) reflects blood flow and capillary condition, which is valuable in assessing brain tumors. We evaluated PCT parameters at the tumor (t) and peritumoral (p) region to differentiate malignant brain tumors.
   METHODS: We performed PCT in 39 patients with supratentorial malignant brain tumors (22 glioblastomas, 6 lymphomas, 11 metastases). Regions of interests were placed manually at tumor, peritumoral region, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter. Cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and permeability surface (PS) were measured. These parameters were divided by those of contralateral normal-appearing white matter to normalize at tumor (relative [r]CBVt, rCBFt, rMTTt, rPSt) and peritumoral regions (rCBVp, rCBFp, rMTTp, rPSp). The parameters were evaluated with Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristics analyses. Stepwise analyses also were performed to select useful PCT parameters for differentiating these tumors.
   RESULTS: The rCBFt and rCBVt of glioblastoma (GBM) were greater than those of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) (P = 0.0005, 0.0002) and brain metastasis (METS) (P = 0.0044, 0.0028). The rMTTp of METS was greater than that of GBM and PCNSL (P = 0.0001, 0.0007). The combination of rCBVt and rPSt could differentiate GBM from other tumors with sensitivity and specificity of 81.8% and 94.1%. The combination of rCBFp and rMTTp could differentiate METS from other tumors with sensitivity and specificity of 90.9% and 82.1%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study introduces and supports the usefulness of PCT parameters for differentiation among GBM, PCNSL, and METS. rCBVt and rPSt may be the best predictors of GBM. rCBFp and rMTTp may be the best predictors of METS.

AB OBJECTIVES: Intraoperative aneurysm rupture (IOAR) is a common complication during intracranial aneurysm (IA) surgery. In light of the paradigm shift regarding IA selected for clipping in the post-International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) era, we aimed to evaluate the risk factors and effects of WAR in an institutional series of clipped ruptured IA (RIA) and unruptured IA (UIA).
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: All IAs treated with microsurgical clipping at our institution between 2003 and 2016 were eligible for this study. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic factors were correlated with occurrence of IOAR in univariate and multivariate analyses. The effect on outcome was analyzed for RIA and UIA separately.
   RESULTS: Nine hundred and three clipped lAs were included in the final analysis (538 UIA and 365 RIA). IOAR occurred in 163 cases (18.1%), mostly during clipping of RIA (37.5% vs. 4.8%) In multivariate analysis, ruptured status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 10.46; P < 0.001), sack size (aOR, 1.05 per mm increase; P = 0.038) and IA location in the anterior communicating artery (aOR, 2.31; P < 0.001) independently predicted IOAR. For RIA cases, IOAR was also independently predicted by rebleeding before therapy (aOR, 3.11; P = 0.033) and clinical severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage (aOR, 1.18 per WFNS grade increase; P = 0.049). IOAR independently predicted poor outcome (aOR, 1.83; P = 0.042) after RIA surgery. In turn, IOAR affected only the risk for cerebral infarct (OR, 3.75; P = 0.003) and incomplete IA occlusion (OR, 3.45; P = 0.003) for UIA cases, but not the outcome (P = 0.263).
   CONCLUSIONS: IOAR was independently predicted by the ruptured status, location, and size of IA and by initial severity of aneurysmal bleeding and pretreatment rebleeding. The influence of IOAR differed between RIA and UIA cases.

AB INTRODUCTION: Thoracic kyphosis can result in neurologic deficits, pain, and cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Vertebral column resection (VCR) is a powerful technique that can be employed for large curves and fixed deformities. This study reports the outcomes of posterior VCR for adult spinal deformity with severe thoracic kyphosis.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients with adult spinal deformity who underwent posterior VCR for severe thoracic kyphosis (defined as segmental kyphosis greater than 80 degrees) was performed. Patients with kyphosis secondary to trauma, tumor, or infection were excluded. Perioperative, radiographic, and minimum 2-year outcomes were assessed.
   RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included. Mean age was 57.1 years and 31.6% were male. Mean preoperative sagittal vertical axis was 57.7 mm and thoracic kyphosis was 92.2 degrees. Among 19 patients, 24 VCR were performed. Mean blood loss was 2188 ml. Perioperative complication rate was 36.8% and mortality rate was 5.3%. Mean post-operative sagittal vertical axis was 42.3 mm and thoracic kyphosis was 58.1 . Incidence of junctional failure at 2-year follow-up was 14.8%: 1 proximal and 2 distal. All patients with junctional disease required reoperation. At mean 35.7-month follow-up, 61.1% of patients reported a significant reduction of hack pain and 50.0% were able to reduce their dose of opioid medications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Single-stage posterior VCR is a powerful technique for the correction of severe thoracic kyphosis. Perioperative morbidity can be high, but a majority of patients fare well at follow-up. Junctional disease occurs both proximal and distal; surgeons should continue to implement strategies to minimize distal junctional disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: Surgical treatment of vertebral artery (VA) and VAeproximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms poses a special challenge to the operating surgeon because of the complex anatomy of the neck and the location of the aneurysm. We report our surgical results of unruptured VA and VA-PICA aneurysms operated on through the transcondylar fossa approach.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 20 patients with unruptured VA and VA-PICA aneurysms who were treated by the transcondylar fossa approach in a single institution from November 2014 to March 2018. Data including clinical profile, radiology, complications, and outcome were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Five patients had VA aneurysms and 15 had VA-PICA aneurysms. All were unruptured aneurysms, and 4 patients were symptomatic. All underwent surgical treatment through the transcondylar fossa approach. Proximal VA occlusion alone for 4 patients along with revascularization for 3 patients was performed. Twelve patients underwent clipping and 1 underwent wrapping of the aneurysm. The transcondylar fossa approach was adequate to expose the aneurysms successfully. There were no intraoperative complications encountered. Only 3 patients had transient postoperative complications. Follow-up imaging showed complete occlusion of all clipped aneurysms and complete thrombosis of the sac in all patients with proximal VA occlusion with or without revascularization.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of rupture of asymptomatic unruptured VA and VA-PICA aneurysms is low, they should be considered for surgical treatment because they carry higher early mortality and morbidity after rupture. The transcondylar fossa approach provides adequate exposure of the aneurysm without permanent lower cranial nerve morbidity.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial hemorrhage, such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), is an extremely rare complication after surgical revascularization for moyamoya disease (MMD). However, the incidence, timing, prognosis, possible mechanism, and prevention are not well known.
   METHODS: Adult patients with MMD who underwent direct bypass or combined bypass and experienced ICH, SAH, or IVH within 7 days postoperatively were enrolled in this study. The medical records and radiologic findings of these patients, together with their intraoperative video recordings, were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Direct superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass or combined bypass was performed for 222 hemispheres in 193 adult patients with MMD between January 2001 and December 2016. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred perioperatively in 8 hemispheres (3.6%) in 8 patients. The hemorrhages developed immediately after STA-MCA direct anastomosis during surgery in 3 patients. Hemorrhage on computed tomography and neurologic deterioration were also observed immediately postoperatively in 2 patients and during the postoperative period in 3 patients. Although 4 patients received medical management, neurosurgical treatment was needed in the other 4 patients. One patient died, and 6 patients were left with moderate or severe disabilities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH, IVH, or SAH) after direct bypass for adult patients with MMD is an extremely rare but fatal complication. Although these hemorrhages can be associated with hyperperfusion syndrome, no effective prevention has been established.

AB BACKGROUND: Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective modality in the treatment of brainstem metastases (BSM), radiation-induced toxicity remains a critical concern. To better understand how severe or lifethreatening toxicity is affected by the location of lesions treated in the brainstem, a review of all available studies reporting SRS treatment for BSM was performed.
   METHODS: Twenty-nine retrospective studies investigating SRS for BSM were reviewed.
   RESULTS: The rates of grade 3 or greater toxicity, based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, varied from 0 to 9.5% (mean 3.4 +/- 2.9%). Overall, the median time to toxicity after SRS was 3 months, with 90% of toxicities occurring before 9 months. A total of 1243 cases had toxicity and location data available. Toxicity rates for lesions located in the medulla were 0.8% (1/131), compared with midbrain and pons, respectively, 2.8% (8/288) and 3.0% (24/811).
   CONCLUSIONS: Current data suggest that brainstem substructure location does not predict for toxicity and lesion volume within this cohort with median tumor volumes 0.04-2.8 cc does not predict for toxicity.

AB OBJECTIVE: To define the role of neuroendoscopy as an adjuvant technique for the management of pediatric complex hydrocephalus.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a series of pediatric patients who had undergone surgery for complex hydrocephalus from January 2002 to March 2017 at 2 pediatric neurosurgery units in Rome, Italy and Mansoura, Egypt. The endoscopic procedures performed included cyst or membrane fenestration, septum pellucidotomy, foraminoplasty, and aqueductoplasty with or without a stent. In selected cases, endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed as a combined procedure. The mean follow-up period was 5 years.
   RESULTS: A total of 68 patients (26 females, 42 males), with a mean age of 2 years (range, 0-18), underwent 109 endoscopic procedures. Of the 68 patients, 39 (57%) were affected by multiloculated hydrocephalus, 17 by isolated lateral ventricle (24.6%), 3 by an excluded lateral ventricle horn (4.3%), 7 by an isolated fourth ventricle (10.1%), and 1 each by an isolated third ventricle and a cavum septi pellucidi cyst. The overall postoperative complications rate was 28% (shunt infection, 16.1%; shunt malfunction, 8.8%; subdural collection, 2.9%). At the latest clinical follow-up visit, 65% of the children had only 1 shunt, 25% (n = 17) had a double ventricular catheter, and 10% (n = 7) were shunt free.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that neuroendoscopy has a main role in the long-term management of complex hydrocephalus, significantly contributing to the reduction of the number of shunts and the shunt revision rate. Neuronavigation should be performed in all cases in which the ideal trajectory should be established.

AB BACKGROUND: Single-level open lumbar microdiscectomy surgery is one of the most straightforward and effective spinal surgeries performed by spinal surgeons today to treat disk herniation. Although a common operation, little in the literature is reported on the exact overall time, cost, and effort associated with the performance of this surgery. The consistency of this operation across institutions and disciplines makes it a good starting point to accurately track the total time and effort of all phases of the surgical intervention.
   METHODS: Eighteen patients undergoing elective single-level open lumbar microdiscectomy surgery were prospectively enrolled in this study. The time spent interacting with each patient by every member of the surgical team was tracked and recorded along will every phone call and e-mail. All perioperative times associated with the surgery were tracked and analyzed. Each patient was followed from their first interaction through surgery and for the first 3 months postoperatively.
   RESULTS: The advanced practice providers spent the most time with the patient both pre- and postoperatively followed by the surgeon and resident. A total of 2.98 hours was spent with the patient preoperatively in clinic and 1.69 hours postoperatively. The total time commitment of an institution treating this condition was 12.56 hours.
   CONCLUSIONS: Comparing our results with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data, a significant discrepancy and underestimation was observed. As such, we hope our results enable health care providers to more accurately allocate resources for the provision of high-quality medical care to patients with this increasingly common condition.

AB OBJECTIVE: Precise morphologic evaluation is important for intracranial aneurysm (IA) management. At present, clinicians manually measure the IA size and neck diameter on 2-dimensional (2D) digital subtraction angiographic (DSA) images and categorize the IA shape as regular or irregular on 3-dimensional (3D)-DSA images, which could result in inconsistency and bias. We investigated whether a computer-assisted 3D analytical approach could improve IA morphology assessment.
   METHODS: Five neurointerventionists evaluated the size, neck diameter, and shape of 39 IAs using current and computer-assisted 3D approaches. In the computer-assisted 3D approach, the size, neck diameter, and undulation index (UI, a shape irregularity metric) were extracted using semiautomated reconstruction of aneurysm geometry using 3D-DSA, followed by IA neck identification and computerized geometry assessment.
   RESULTS: The size and neck diameter measured using the manual 2D approach were smaller than computerassisted 3D measurements by 2.01 mm (P < 0.001) and 1.85 mm (P < 0.001), respectively. Applying the definitions of small IAs (<7 mm) and narrow-necked IAs (<4 mm) from the reported data, interrater variation in manual 2D measurements resulted in inconsistent classification of the size of 14 IAs and the necks of 19 IAs. Visual inspection resulted in an inconsistent shape classification for 23 IAs among the raters. Greater consistency was achieved using the computer-assisted 3D approach for size (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 1.00), neck measurements (ICC, 0.96), and shape quantification (UI; ICC, 0.94).
   CONCLUSIONS: Computer-assisted 3D morphology analysis can improve accuracy and consistency in measurements compared with manual 2D measurements. It can also more reliably quantify shape irregularity using the UI. Future application of computer-assisted analysis tools could help clinicians standardize morphology evaluations, leading to more consistent IA evaluations.

AB BACKGROUND: Hospital readmission is a key surgical quality metric associated with financial penalties and greater healthcare costs. We examined the clinical risk factors and postoperative complications associated with 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions after cranial neurosurgery.
   METHODS: We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2011 to 2016 for adult patients who had undergone a cranial neurosurgical procedure. Multivariable logistic regression with backward model selection was used to determine the predictors associated with 30-day unplanned hospital readmission.
   RESULTS: Of 40,802 cranial neurosurgical cases, 4147 (10.2%) required an unplanned readmission. Postoperative complications were greater in the readmission cohort (18.5% vs. 9.9%; P < 0.001). On adjusted analysis, the clinical factors predictive of unplanned readmission included hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, coagulopathy, chronic steroid use, and preoperative anemia, hyponatremia, and hypoalbuminemia (P <= 0.01 for all). Higher American Society of Anesthesiology class (III to V), operative time >216 minutes, and unplanned reoperation were also associated with an increased likelihood of readmission (P <= 0.001 for all). The postoperative complications predictive of unplanned readmissions were wound infection (odds ratio [OR], 4.90; P < 0.001), pulmonary embolus (OR, 3.94; P < 0.001), myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest (OR, 2.37; P < 0. 001), sepsis (OR, 1.73; P < 0.001), deep venous thrombosis (OR, 1.50; P = 0.002), and urinary tract infection (OR, 1.45; P = 0.002). Female sex, transfer status, and postoperative pulmonary complications were protective of readmission (P < 0.05 for all).
   CONCLUSIONS: Unplanned hospital readmission after cranial neurosurgery is a common event. The identification of high-risk patients who undergo cranial procedures might allow hospitals to reduce unplanned readmissions and their associated healthcare costs.

   COMPLICATIONS; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: Decompressive hemicraniectomy to control medically refractory intracranial hypertension and cerebral edema and evacuate mass lesions in traumatic brain injury is a widely accepted treatment paradigm. However, the critical specifications of the bone flap size necessary to control the intracranial pressure (ICP) and provide improved patient outcomes is unknown. We assessed the effect of craniectomy size on the outcomes in surgical decompression for traumatic brain injury.
   METHODS: From 2003 to 2011, 58 cases of decompressive hemicraniectomy were performed for evacuation of hematoma and treatment of refractory ICP in adult patients with traumatic brain injury. The surface area of the decompressive bone flaps was calculated from the postoperative computed tomography scans and correlated with the ICP and Glasgow Coma Scale scores immediately postoperatively and during long-term follow-up.
   RESULTS: Decompressive craniectomy led to a statistically significant continued reduction in the preoperative ICP values (24.5 mm Hg; range, 5-30 mm Hg) compared with the postoperative ICP (16.7 mm Hg; range, 1-30; P = 0.006). However, no significant improvement in the preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (7.47 mm Hg; range, 3-15; vs. 7.50 mm Hg; range, 3-15; P = 0.96) was observed with hemicraniectomy.
   CONCLUSION: For surface areas of 7000-16,000 mm(2), size was an independent factor in ICP reduction but not for the overall neurologic outcome.

ID HOMOCYSTEINE
AB OBJECTIVE: Homocysteine, an amino acid derived from methionine metabolism, has gained great importance as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases as the result of its thrombogenic properties and endothelial injury association. However, its role in the etiology and screening of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) has not been well studied. We aimed to test the hypothesis of a positive association between hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and IAs.
   METHODS: A case-control study was performed at a vascular neurosurgery unit in Brazil between 2016 and 2017. In total, 180 patients were included: 142 patients with previous IAs (case group) and 38 patients with a previous diagnosis of arteriovenous malformation and no aneurysms on imaging evaluation (control group). HHcy was defined as homocysteine levels greater than 15 mu mol/L. Multivariate models were designed to adjust for potential confounders: age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoker status.
   RESULTS: The case group was older (56.3 + 12.6 years vs. 40.9 +/- 14.0 years, P < 0.001) and had a greater prevalence of women (76.1% vs. 55.3%, P = 0.012), as well as hypertension (45.1% vs. 2.6%, P < 0.001), dyslipidemia (60.6% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.001), and smokers (41.5% vs. 0.0%, P < 0.001). Median homocysteine in the cases was similar to the controls (10.5 mu mol/L [8.3-14.0] vs. 10.7 mu mol/L [8.2-13.3], respectively, P = 0.450). There was a trend toward greater HHcy prevalence in the case group (20.4% vs. 7.9%, P = 0.073). HHcy was associated with greater age, male sex, hypertension, and smoking status. After multivariate adjustment, HHcy had no association with IAs (odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval 0.30-5.97, P = 0.703).
   CONCLUSIONS: No association was found between HHcy and IAs.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative rupture of a cerebral aneurysm during neurosurgery can be a devastating event that increases perioperative morbidity and mortality. Rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) is a technique to obtain flow arrest for short periods of time during dissection or rupture of the aneurysm. The objective of this study was to evaluate the neurological and cardiac effects of repetitive periods of RVP during cerebrovascular surgery.
   METHODS: Data from patients who underwent repetitive RVP during craniotomy for cerebrovascular disorders were retrospectively analyzed from a single-center medical records database (Cegeka Medical Health Care Systems). We compared preoperative and postoperative troponin levels (cTnl) to assess cardiac ischemia. Preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results were screened for RVP-induced infarcts by evaluating diffusion restriction in the hemisphere contralateral to the operated side and the fossa posterior.
   RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were analyzed. An immediate decrease of systolic arterial blood pressure (<60 mm Hg) was achieved after initiation of RVP. Postoperative MRI did not reveal areas of diffusion restriction. RVP tended to be a predictor of postoperative cTnl increase. Preoperative and postoperative cTnl levels were higher in patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage compared to patients without one. After 24 hours cTnl jevels normalized to preoperative values.
   CONCLUSIONS: Systolic arterial blood pressure decreased after RVP but normalized immediately when pacing stopped. MRI of the brain did not show RVP-related ischemia and the limited cTnl level increase normalized to preoperative values. Therefore, RVP during short periods of time seems to be a safe blood pressure-lowering technique for the brain and heart.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the application of functional neuronavigation in surgeries of adult cerebral gliomas.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 375 cases of adult cerebral glioma patients who underwent microsurgical treatment between 2011 and 2017 in our department. Among them, 142 patients underwent surgery using functional neuronavigation (group A), and the other 233 patients were operated on without the help of functional neuronavigation (group B). For both groups, we categorized them into several subgroups according to the lesion locations.
   RESULTS: A significant difference in the gross total resection rate was observed between group A and group B (P = 0.001 for overall; P = 0.036 for EO area; and P = 0.004 for BBT area). The postoperative complication rate of group A was much lower than that of group B (P = 0.003 for overall; and P = 0.016 for BBT area). The postoperative 6-month Karnofsky Performance Scale score of all patients in group A was significantly higher than that of group B. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed significant increases in the median survival time of group A compared with that of group B (P< 0.001 for overall; P = 0.012 for EO area; P = 0.006 for BBT area), and the Cox proportional regression analysis estimated the hazard ratio of the functional neuronavigation to be 0.533, helping reduce the risk of death by 46.7%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the application of neuronavigation in adult glioma surgery can improve postoperative quality of life and lengthen the survival time of patients, especially in cases involving the brainstem and the eloquent area.

AB OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the applicability of the Simpson grading system to estimate the risk of tumor recurrence after microsurgery for recurrent meningiomas.
   METHODS: Correlations between the Simpson grade and the extent of resection (EOR) (gross total resection [Simpson grade I and II] vs. subtotal resection [Simpson grade >= III]) with tumor relapse after microsurgery for meningioma recurrence were investigated compared with the findings in primary diagnosed tumors. Location-specific differences were further elucidated in subgroup analyses.
   RESULTS: A total of 829 individuals (88% in group A) with primary diagnosed meningioma and 109 patients with first postoperative recurrence (12% in group B) who underwent surgery were included. In group A, both Simpson grade (P = 0.003) and EOR (P < 0.001) correlated strongly with recurrence. In group B, Simpson grade correlated with tumor location (P = 0.030), and the risk of subtotal resection was greater in the posterior fossa (odds ratio, 5.26; P = 0.018) and skull base (odds ratio, 6.16; P = 0.002) meningiomas. Older age at tumor relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; P = 0.001), male sex (HR, 2.19; P = 0.02), and grade 2/3 histologic findings (HR, 2.18; P = 0.02). However, neither the Simpson grade nor dichotomized EOR correlated with further tumor recurrence. The frequency of postoperative complications was similar in both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for recurrent meningiomas is not generally associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications compared with resection of primary diagnosed tumors. However, the Simpson grade and EOR in recurrent meningiomas correlated poorly with further tumor relapse. The lower prognostic value of the tumor remnants left behind during microsurgery for recurrent meningiomas should be considered when operating on lesions that can be surgically challenging.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential early risk factors of mild cognitive impairment after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with endovascular coiling during a 5-year period. The demographic characteristics and radiologic and laboratory data were collected. Cognitive assessments were carried out using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment at 6 months after ictus. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors associated with the development of mild cognitive impairment.
   RESULTS: Of 152 patients, 59 patients (39%) developed cognitive impairment 6 months later. Univariate analysis showed that the patients with anterior communicating artery or anterior cerebral artery aneurysms (P < 0.001) with Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 7 or less at ictus (P = 0.002), Hunt and Hess grade of 3 or higher (P = 0.002), and Fisher grade of 3 or higher (P = 0.032) were more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment. The risk of mild cognitive impairment was increased for patients who had delayed cerebral ischemia (P = 0.040) and hydrocephalus (P = 0.002). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, mild cognitive impairment was independently associated with anterior communicating artery or anterior cerebral aneurysms (odds ratio [OR], 11.046; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.371-36.198; P < 0.001), delayed cerebral ischemia (OR, 6.153; 95% CI, 1.587-23.855; P = 0.009), and hydrocephalus (OR, 8.768; 95% CI, 2.115-36.345; P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: The location of the aneurysm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and hydrocephalus were independently associated with the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and can contribute to improved identification of patients at high risk for mild cognitive impairment.

ID HEMATOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic posterior fossa subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is a rare subtype of subdural hemorrhage in head injuries. Existing data on its pathophysiology and outcome are currently limited; therefore, the condition is not yet fully understood. The present study aimed to determine the incidence, outcome, and prognostic factors for traumatic posterior fossa SDH.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the nationwide trauma registry Japan Trauma Data Bank. We identified adult patients (i.e., aged >= 18 years) who had posterior fossa SDH after blunt head trauma from 2004 to 2015. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. We compared patients with and without posterior fossa SDH and adjusted for confounders using a multivariate logistic regression model.
   RESULTS: A total of 75,838 patients had blunt head injuries. Of these, 266 (0.35/0) had posterior fossa SDH, and 177 (median age, 69 years; interquartile range, 55-76) were eligible for analysis. The distribution of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was bimodal, and the median score was 14 (interquartile range, 9-15). The mortality rate was 16.9% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 11.7%-23.3%). A large posterior fossa SDH (>30 cm(3) ; >1 cm thick), low GCS score on arrival, and the presence of a skull fracture were significantly associated with mortality, with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.51 (95% CI, 1.46-13.9), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), and 4.59 (95% CI, 1.52-13.9), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic posterior fossa SDH was extremely rare in our data set. Mortality correlated with the size of the SDH, GCS score on admission, and the presence of a skull fracture.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present the basic topographic and anatomic features of the clivus and adjacent structures with an objective of possible improvements and optimization of the extended endoscopic endonasal posterior (transclival) approach when removing tumors of the clivus and anterior regions of the posterior cranial fossa.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A craniometric study was conducted on 125 human skulls. A topographic anatomic study was conducted on 25 cadaver head specimens with arterial and venous beds stained with colored silicone, according to the method developed by us, to visualize its features and individual variability.
   RESULTS: The most important anatomic features of the external and internal regions of the clivus and the adjacent neural and vascular structures were analyzed. An accessible zone for the most effective transclival approach to the posterior cranial fossa is also specified.
   CONCLUSION: The endoscopic endonasal transclival approach can be used to obtain access to centrally located tumors of the posterior cranial fossa. It is an alternative to transcranial approaches in the surgical treatment of tumors of the clivus.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes and complications of stereotactic radiosurgery treatment for trigeminal schwannoma (TS).
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to describe the presentation and outcomes of patients undergoing Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for TS. Clinical, radiographic, and stereotactic radiosurgery dose plans were reviewed. Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis were performed to identify factors associated with poor tumor control.
   RESULTS: A total of 22 patients with TS were treated with GKRS between 1990 and 2018. One patient had a history of neurofibromatosis type II. Of the study population, 81% underwent GKRS as a first-line treatment. The average tumor volume was 3.3 cm(3) and the average margin treatment dose was 14.1 Gy. The median clinical and radiographic follow-up period were 18.5 and 27 months, respectively. Tumor control was achieved in 17 patients (77.3%). Symptomatic improvement was noted in 8 patients (42.1%). Tumor expansion was observed in 7 patients (31.8%) and was associated with poor tumor control at last follow-up (P < 0.05). Patients who developed transient tumor expansion had higher margin doses (14.9 +/- 1.1 Gy) compared with patients who did not have expansion (13.6 +/- 1.3 Gyk P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS provides effective control for most TS. Increased margin doses are associated with tumor expansion, which was a poor prognostic event associated with progression and clinical decline. Based on these results, combined with analysis of available data from other series of TS treated with GKRS, we believe that margin dose between 13 and 14 Gy offers a high probability of tumor control, yet minimizing risk of adverse radiation effects.

ID POSTERIOR ASPECT; HIDDEN ZONE; SPINE; LOCATION; ROOT
AB BACKGROUND: To prevent risk of iatrogenic instability after surgery for upper lumbar disc herniation, we adapted a microsurgical translaminar approach (keyhole laminotomy), which allows less destructive laminotomy. We compared results of translaminar and interlaminar approaches.
   METHODS: The study enrolled 48 patients who underwent single-level discectomy in the upper lumbar spine (L1-2 or L2-3). Patients were allocated to 2 groups: a translaminar group (n = 20) or an interlaminar group in = 28). Mean patient age was 57.04 +/- 12.77 years, and median follow-up duration was 3.5 years (range, 1.0-7.0 years). Clinical and radiologic data were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, surgical level, and preoperative symptoms, were nonsignificantly different. At 1 year after surgery, improvement in leg pain as determined by visual analog scale was nonsignificantly different. Improvement in visual analog scale for back pain was significantly greater in the translaminar group compared with interlaminar group (mean 4.00 +/- 1.56 vs. 2.45 +/- 2.01, P < 0.001). Surgical outcome was not different between groups. Mean decrease in disc height at operated level was not significantly different between groups. Mean increase in segmental range of motion at surgical levels was significantly greater in the interlaminar group (-3.38 +/- 4.03 degrees vs. 1.10 +/- 3.03 degrees , P = 0.010), and mean recovery of total lumbar lordosis was significantly greater in the translaminar group (9.80 +/- 5.96 degrees vs. 0.43 +/- 8.45 degrees, P = 0.021).
   CONCLUSIONS: The translaminar approach provides a safe and effective alternative to the classic interlaminar approach for upper lumbar disc herniation.

LA English
DT Article
DE Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor; Pseudocapsule; Schwannoma; True
   capsule
ID NEURAL SHEATH TUMORS; RESECTION; SERIES; LIMB
AB BACKGROUND: Using proper surgical technique, schwannomas can be resected safely, with a low recurrence rate and high likelihood of improvement in symptomatology. There are multiple peritumoral tissue layers, and finding the correct plane is critical to safe tumor enucleation. The contents of the pseudocapsule tissue surrounding a schwannoma are not well described, and the consequences of resecting or leaving pseudocapsules are unknown.
   METHODS: An institutional database was searched for any pathology reports that contained both of the words "schwannoma" and "capsule." Charts and histopathologic specimens were reviewed to determine the contents of various tissue layers and determine if there was any correlation between pseudocapsular contents and clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: A pseudocapsule was separately sent for pathology in 36 patients during schwannoma resection. Ten pseudocapsule specimens contained microscopic foci of tumor. In a separate 6 patients, there was evidence of nerve fascicles. There were no correlations between the tumor or nerve in the pseudocapsule and postoperative neurologic deficits. After an average follow-up time of 3.1 years, no patients developed a recurrence either clinically or on follow-up imaging (imaging available in 52.7%). Histopathologically, the pseudocapsule was made of dense hypocellular collagen and occasionally contained arteries, veins, and nerve fascicles.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pseudocapsule surrounding a schwannoma occasionally contained nerve tissue and blood vessels. While a microscopic focus of tumor was often found in this tissue layer, recurrence is exceedingly rare and did not occur in this case series. The risk of undue pseudocapsule dissection likely outweighs any negligible benefit from microscopic cytoreduction.

AB OBJECTIVE: The counseling of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is difficult; there is variability in the diagnostic criteria, and a definitive diagnosis can be made only postoperatively. A patient's clinical response to shunting is also difficult to predict. This study examines the subjective experience of patients treated for iNPH, to identify the challenges patients face and to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.
   METHODS: We reviewed a consecutive series of patients diagnosed with iNPH who underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery between January 2012 and March 2016 at our institution. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 31 patients. Interviews were analyzed using the principles of grounded theory.
   RESULTS: Thirty-one patients who underwent shunt surgery for iNPH were interviewed to reach saturation of themes. Seven themes were identified: 1) long preoperative course causes morbidity; 2) the decision to have shunt surgery is easy to make; 3) patients primarily desire to gain independence; 4) patients show variable levels of anxiety; 5) comorbid conditions interfere with postoperative assessment; 6) patients stand by their decision to have shunt surgery; and 7) outside information is used before surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients often present to the neurosurgeon frustrated and desperate after a long preoperative course. It is important to acknowledge the uncertainty regarding diagnosis and response to shunting when counseling patients. Comorbid conditions interfere with the ability to assess progression of iNPH and the effectiveness of the shunt. Patient caregivers play a large role in decision making and clinical course and should be included when counseling patients.

ID FLEXIBILITY; TRACTION; RADIOGRAPHS; DISC; FILM
AB OBJECTIVE: Segmental flexibility in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is crucial for the development of nonfusion and osteotomy technology. However, only global curve flexibility has been assessed in previous studies. Knowledge about segmental characteristics is absent.
   METHODS: Twenty patients with severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were enrolled in the present study. The vertebral and disc wedge angles were measured, and the segmental flexibility index was assessed by the correction rate of disc wedging on the traction film. Least significant difference analysis was used to compare the distribution of the variable. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the stiffness of the global curves, and their relative wedging was compared.
   RESULTS: Vertebral wedging decreased from the apex toward the end. The apical and adjacent vertebrae accounted for 67.44% +/- 8.05% of the total vertebral wedging deformities. Disc wedging significantly decreased upward and downward from the apex. Disc wedging demonstrated no significant differences between U1 (first above the apex) and U2 or L1 (first below the apex) and L2, and these 4 discs accounted for 75.47% +/- 9.25% of the total disc wedging deformities. The levels close to the apical discs (U2 and L2) had the smallest extent of limited correctability. Segment disc flexibility showed a W-shaped distribution. The disc angle in the non-stiff group was significantly larger than the vertebral angle (40.13 degrees +/- 4.67 degrees vs. 26.62 degrees +/- 6.99 degrees; P< 0.001); however, similar results were not noted in the stiff group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Significant apical tethering in both vertebral body and disc wedging occurred, and the relative wedging changed significantly according to the rigidity of the main thoracic curves.

AB OBJECTIVE: Despite several methods of conservative management, many patients with atlanto-occipital (AO) joint pain complain of persistent pain. In the current study, the authors investigated the clinical efficacy of intra-articular pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy for the management of refractory chronic AO joint pain.
   METHODS: Twenty patients with refractory AO joint pain were recruited, and each received intra-articular AO joint PRF stimulation. Pain reduction after PRF therapy was measured using a numerical rating scale (NRS) before and at 1 and 3 months after treatment. Successful pain relief was defined as >= 50% reduction in the NRS score compared with the pretreatment score. At 3 months after treatment, patient satisfaction levels were also examined. Patients reporting very good (score = 7) or good (score = 6) results were considered to be satisfied with the procedure.
   RESULTS: The NRS scores changed significantly over time. At 1 and 3 months after PRF therapy, the NRS scores were significantly reduced compared with pretreatment scores. Sixteen of the 20 (80%) patients reported pain relief and were satisfied with treatment results 3 months after PRF. No adverse effects were reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intra-articular PRF therapy is a beneficial treatment tool for managing refractory chronic AO joint pain.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the risk factors for 14-day mortality in pediatric patients undergoing early decompressive craniectomy (DC) after traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   METHODS: This retrospective analysis included all pediatric patients (<= 16 years of age) undergoing DC within 12 hours of TBI between August 2011 and July 2017 at the authors' institute. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, surgical information, and laboratory parameters were retrieved from medical records. Risk factors for 14-day mortality were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. First, potentially relevant variables were compared between those who died within 14 days versus those who did not. Variables with P < 0.10 were entered into the final multivariate regression analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 36 patients (23 boys and 13 girls; median age, 7 years) were included in the analysis. Fall (n = 19, 52.8%) was the leading cause of injury. The 14-day mortality was 38.9% (14/36). At the time of admission, the median Glasgow Score Scale (GCS) was 6 (IQR 4-8), and the mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) (+/- standard deviation) was 29.03 +/- 8.54. Preoperative hypoxia, defined as oxyhemoglobin arterial saturation <90% or apnea >20 seconds, was observed in 6 patients (16.7%). Coagulopathy was present in 14 patients (38.9%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested an association between 14-day mortality and younger age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.708, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.513-0.978; P = 0.036) and higher ISS (OR = 1.399; 95% CI: 1.023-1.914; P = 0.035).
   CONCLUSIONS: In children undergoing early DC after TBI, risk factors for 14-day mortality include younger age and higher ISS.

AB BACKGROUND: Hemiparesis is a major symptom of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH). Its severity does not always correlate with hematoma size. The authors analyzed hematoma thickness, pressure, and tension to clarify the mechanism of hemiparesis in CSDH patients.
   METHODS: A burr-hole surgery was performed on 124 CSDHs in 102 patients. Hematoma thickness and midline shift were measured by computed tomography, and hematoma pressure was measured in surgery. According to Laplace law, tension was calculated as follows: (half the hematoma thickness x hematoma pressure)/2. Student t test and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) were applied in statistical analysis of findings.
   RESULTS: Motor weakness was identified in 76.5 degrees k of our cases. Tension was strongly related to hemiparesis (r = - 0.747, P < 0.01), whereas hematoma thickness (r = -0.458, P < 0.01) and pressure (r = -0.596, P < 0.01) were moderately correlated. Mean age of 14 patients (13.7%) with headache was much younger than those without headache (P < 0.01). Stronger midline shift (P < 0.01) and greater ratio of midline shift to hematoma thickness (P< 0.01) were statistically correlated with headache. Recurrence was recognized in 8 patients (7.8%), and stronger midline shift (P < 0.05) and greater ratio of midline shift to hematoma thickness (P < 0.05) were statistically associated with recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tension is the most influencing factor to hemiparesis in CSDH patients. This study also elucidates the mechanism for quick recovery from hemiparesis after surgery in that tension on the motor cortex is decreased immediately by drainage.

ID ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; YOUNGER PATIENTS;
   METAANALYSIS; OUTCOMES; OCTOGENARIANS; DEVICES; TRIALS; VESSEL
AB BACKGROUND: Although elderly patients have generally worse outcomes after acute ischemic stroke, they may derive significant incremental benefit from thrombectomy as compared with medical management. Although several case series for octogenarians have been reported, data for nonagenarians are scarce.
   METHODS: A prospectively maintained institutional mechanical thrombectomy database was reviewed for nonagenarians who underwent thrombectomy between January 2013 and July 2017. Patient demographic data and clinical history data were extracted, and clinical and radiographic outcomes were assessed. Univariate analysis was used to determine correlation between treatment and radiographic data and outcome.
   RESULTS: During the study period, 30 patients >= 90 years old underwent mechanical thrombectomy. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on presentation was 20. Successful reperfusion (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 2b/3) was achieved in 27 patients (90%). One patient (3%) was discharged to home, and 9 patients (30%) were discharged to a rehabilitation facility. The 90-day mortality was 70%. Six patients (21%) returned to living at home. All 6 patients had successful reperfusion after the procedure; average infarct burden on postthrombectomy neuroimaging was 1.5 cm 3 , and infarct volume was <7 cm(3) in all cases. Final infarct volume of <10 cm(3) was a strong predictor of whether a patient returned to live at home (P = 0.002), with a trend toward better outcome as assessed by modified Rankin Scale (P = 0.076).
   CONCLUSIONS: Large vessel thrombectomy in nonagenarians is safe and offers patients a chance at returning to functional baseline. All patients returning home in our cohort had successful recanalization and minimal stroke burden after thrombectomy.

AB OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sufentanil-propofol (SF) versus remifentanil-propofol (RF) as maintenance therapy for anesthesia in patients undergoing craniotomy.
   METHODS: Randomized controlled studies on SF and RF as anesthesia for craniotomy were searched in electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang Data. All studies were published up to December 31, 2017. The primary outcomes were wake-up time, extubation time, and pain score. The secondary outcomes were heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and adverse reactions.
   RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, 14 studies involving 927 patients were investigated. Compared with the SF group, RF could significantly reduce the wake-up time and extubation time after craniotomy (P = 0.02, standardized mean difference [SMD], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-2.18; P = 0.0001; SMD, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.90-2.83, respectively). Meanwhile, SF had better efficacy to alleviate postoperative pain than RF (P - 0.001; SMD, 2.10; 95% CI, -3.37 to -0.82). However, there were no obvious differences in improving heart rate and MAP between the 2 groups (P = 0.46; SMD, 0.17; 95% CI, -0.28 to 0.62; P = 0.43; SMD, 0.16; 95% CI, -0.54 to 0.23, respectively). Moreover, there were no significant differences in the incidents of nausea and vomiting, shivering, fidgeting, and respiratory depression between the SF and RF groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: RF as anesthesia for craniotomy had better effects in reducing the time of postoperative wake-up and extubation and significantly alleviating pain. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse reactions between the 2 groups. The findings will prove beneficial for the rational use of clinical anesthetic drugs in the future.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether radiographic findings associated with thoracolumbar burst fractures could be predictors of failure of short-segment posterior instru-mentation with insertion screw at the fracture level (SSPI-f).
   METHODS: Seventy-five patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture surgically treated by SSPI-f were enrolled in the study and divided into 2 groups: a reduction group (n = 46) and a failed-reduction group (n = 29). Radio-graphic data including local kyphosis, Cobb angle, anterior vertebral height, posterior vertebral height (PVH), anterior/posterior vertebral height ratio, interpedicle distance (IPD), bony compress area, bony fracture area, and compress-fracture area of the fractured vertebra and clinical data including age and neurologic function were also analyzed. t test, Pearson chi(2) test, and binary logistic regression were performed to compare the values.
   RESULTS: The PVH in the failed-reduction group was smaller than that of the reduction group (83.5% +/- 7.2% and 89.1% +/- 5.4%, respectively) (P = 0.001). The IPD differed between the reduction and failed-reduction group (18.0% +/- 4.1% and 25.8% +/- 7.1%, respectively) (P < 0.001). There was a statistical difference between the 2 groups in delayed time before surgery (P = 0.008). There was a significant difference of bony fracture area and compress-fracture area of the fractured vertebra between the failed-reduction and reduction group (both P < 0.001). Binary logistic regression showed that IPD was a risk factor of reduction failure of SSPI-f (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that increased IPD was a risk factor of failed-reduction of SSPI-f in managing thoracolumbar burst fractures, particularly for patients with neurologic deficit, whereas local kyphosis, Cobb angle, anterior vertebral height, PVH, anterior/posterior vertebral height ratio, bony compress area, bony fracture area, and compress-fracture area of the fractured vertebra were not.

AB BACKGROUND: Hemodynamics plays an important role in the natural history of intracranial aneurysms. However, it is difficult to obtain longitudinal aneurysm image data. In this study, we had a rare chance to follow the process of growth and rupture of a middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of hemodynamics for growth and rupture in this particular aneurysm patient.
   METHODS: A 57-year-old woman presented with 2 unruptured MCA aneurysms and 1 ruptured anterior choroidal artery (AchA) aneurysm. The unruptured left MCA aneurysm grew in 7 months and ruptured at 11 months. The rupture region was confirmed during the clipping treatment. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were conducted on the AchA and MCA aneurysms in 3 serial imaging procedures, and calculated hemodynamics was correlated with aneurysm growth and rupture.
   RESULTS: The ruptured right AchA aneurysm had much lower wall shear stress (WSS) and higher oscillatory shear index (OSI) than the unruptured left MCA aneurysm. Comparison of the aneurysm growth region with the WSS distribution showed that growth occurred in a high WSS area. During the progression of the MCA aneurysm, we observed that the high aneurysmal WSS region grew first and then the growing region changed into a low WSS level; eventually, rupture occurred in a low WSS area.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that aneurysm rupture might be associated with low WSS and high OSI, whereas aneurysm growth may be related to high WSS in this particular individual MCA aneurysm patient.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to provide a new classification of the lateral region of the lumbar spinal canal (LLSC) and evaluate the clinical outcomes of surgical treatment of LLSC stenosis guided by the classification.
   METHODS: We developed a new functional classification of the LLSC by dividing the region into 5 zones. Thirty random lumbar imaging studies from patients with single-level LLSC stenosis in our department from January 2015 to June 2015 were evaluated by 3 examiners to validate its reliability. Subsequently, a prospective clinical outcome study of 76 patients with single-level LLSC stenosis from July 2015 to July 2016 with 2-year follow-up available was undertaken. All the patients had undergone either percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal decompression with foraminoplasty or percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar decompression, according to the classification. The dinical outcomes were evaluated using MacNab criteria, and pre- and postoperative leg pain were evaluated using the visual analog scale.
   RESULTS: We observed a 93.3% agreement among examiners. The mean follow-up duration was 15.6 months (range, 3-24). We found good and excellent outcomes in 93.4% of the patients at the last follow-up examination. The mean preoperative visual analog scale score was 5.72 +/- 1.18 (range, 4-9), which had decreased to 1.26 +/- 0.81 (range, 0-3) at the third month postoperatively and to 0.78 +/- 0.62 (range, 0-1) by the last follow-up visit. Dural tears appeared in 2 patients, and migrated bone had moved into the spinal canal after the surgery in 1 patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: The new classification of LLSC can provide objective criteria for full-endoscopic surgery that could lead to better clinical outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between functional connectivity (FC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurological impairment in patients with cervical spondylosis and healthy controls.
   METHODS: A total of 24 patients with cervical spondylosis with or without myelopathy and 17 neurologically intact, healthy volunteer subjects were prospectively enrolled in a cross-sectional study involving observational MRI and evaluation of neurological function using the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score. Seed-to-seed connectivity and seed-to-voxel connectivity on functional MRI data were performed using a general linear model of connectivity with respect to age and mJOA score.
   RESULTS: Increased FC was observed with increasing neurological impairment in patients with cervical stenosis within sensorimotor areas, including precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and supplemental motor regions, using both seed-to-seed and seed-to-voxel analyses. The anterior cingulate showed increasing connectivity with the supplemental motor area, thalamus, and cerebellum with increasing neurological function. Similarly, the thalamus, cerebellum, and putamen presented with increasing connectivity to both the bilateral precuneus and the posterior cingulate with an increasing mJOA score.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cervical spondylosis exhibiting neurological impairment experience changes in brain connectivity similar to that of patients with chronic traumatic spinal cord injury. These results suggest an increase in FC within sensorimotor regions with increasing neurological impairment and decreased connectivity between the cerebellum, putamen, and thalamus to the anterior and posterior cingulate and frontal lobe regions.

AB OBJECTIVE: The hi-needle technique is a new technique for percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy. This technique combines the advantages of Yeung endoscopic spine system (YESS) and transforaminal endoscopic spine system (TESSYS) techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of the bi-needle technique for percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy and compare it with the TESSYS technique.
   METHODS: We reviewed 86 patients with single-level lumbar disc herniation treated by percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy in our hospital from June 2013 to December 2015. Bi-needle technique was used in 49 patients (30 men, 19 women; average age 40.4 +/- 5.2 years). TESSYS technique was used in 37 patients (19 men, 18 women; average age 42.8 +/- 6.4 years). Clinical results were evaluated and compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Symptoms in both groups were significantly improved at the last follow-up (P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in visual analog scale and lumbar Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores between bi-needle and TESSYS groups at last follow-up (P = 0.69 and P = 0.33, respectively). Operative time was shorter in the bi-needle group (P < 0.01). Recurrence rate and reoperation rate were lower in the bi-needle group (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively). Discitis was diagnosed in 2 patients in the TESSYS group. There were no patients with postoperative discitis in the bi-needle group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The bi-needle technique is safe and effective for treatment of lumbar disc herniation. Compared with TESSYS technique, operative time is shorter, and recurrence and reoperation rates are lower.

   FUSION; ALIGNMENT; OUTCOMES; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) is a common phenomenon after long segmental fusion surgery of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. However, the inability to reliably identify vertebral endplates on lateral upright radiographs has made an accurate measurement of proximal junctional angle (PJA) technically impossible in many patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether a grayscale inversion view is more reliable to measure PJA and to assess PJK accurately.
   METHODS: A total of 162 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis who underwent posterior spinal fusion surgeries were included in this study. PJA was measured on preoperative lateral standing films using 3 methods (upper-instrumented vertebrae [UIV] + 1, UIV + 2, and UIV to T2) on both standard view and grayscale inversion view. Two physicians independently measured the PJA twice at a 1-month interval. Intra- and interobserver reliabilities were compared between the 2 radiographic views. Forty patients with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were randomly selected. PJA was measured for these patients on both views of lateral standing films and MRI images. The correlation coefficients between PJA obtained on MRI and PJA obtained on radiographs with different views were calculated respectively.
   RESULTS: The intraclass correlation coefficients were greater in a grayscale inversion view than in a standard view in all 3 methods for both observers, and the intraclass correlation coefficients of interobserver reliabilities also were greater in a grayscale inversion view. The correlation coefficient between PJA obtained on grayscale inversion view and preoperative MRI was greater in all methods compared with standard view.
   CONCLUSIONS: Grayscale inversion view can be a more reliable tool for the evaluation of PJK as compared with the conventional measurement. We recommend the application of a grayscale inversion view to measure PJA and assess PJK in clinical practice, particularly for patients instrumented to the upper thoracic spine.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features, surgical complications, and functional outcomes of the surgical treatment of patients with cavernous malformations (CMs) involving the medulla oblongata.
   METHODS: The charts of 69 patients undergoing surgical treatment of CMs in the medulla oblongata, pontomedullary, and cervicomedullary junctions between 2011 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, lesion characteristics, operative documents, and patient outcomes were examined.
   RESULTS: Of the 69 patients, the male-to-female ratio was 1.3. The mean patient age was 32.6 years, and the mean mRS score was 2.7 on admission. Postoperatively, 21 patients (30.4%) had deficits of cough reflexes, and 6 patients (8.7%) experienced respiratory rhythm disorder and dyspnea. The mean follow-up duration was 35.3 months. At the last follow-up evaluation, the mean mRS score was 1.8, and 53 patients (80.3%) had favorable outcomes, with mRS scores <= 2. The conditions of the patients improved in 45 cases (68.2%), remained unchanged in 11 cases (16.7%), and worsened in 10 cases (15.1%) relative to their preoperative baseline. The independent adverse factors for longterm functional outcome were increased age, multiple hemorrhages, presence of developmental venous anomalies, and lack of perilesional edema.
   CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory dysfunction and deficits of cough reflexes can commonly occur during the early postoperative period for surgical resection of CMs involving the medulla oblongata. Favorable functional outcomes can be achieved by surgery, especially for younger patients who experience fewer hemorrhages and have lesions with perilesional edema and the absence of developmental venous anomalies.

AB OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic value of 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance 3-dimensional sampling perfection with application-optimized contrast using different flip angle evolution (3D-SPACE) in the detection of sinus wall invasion and sinus patency in parasinus meningiomas.
   METHODS: In this study, 28 patients with suspected meningiomas adjacent to the venous sinus underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography, and 3D-SPACE scans. We collected patient charts and surgical reports for demographic details, histologic analysis, and neurologic performance preoperatively and postoperatively. Images obtained by each technique were assessed independently by 2 neurosurgeons for characteristics of sinus infiltration, wall invasion, lumen patency, and collateral veins.
   RESULTS: The blood flow signal inside the lumen and collateral veins were depressed and presented as black, contrasting well with the sinus wall on 3D-SPACE imaging. When the curved-planar reconstruction images were combined, it was intuitive and accurate to detect the extent of sinus wall invasion by meningioma and also to detect lumen patency. An intratumoral "false lumen" was shown to maintain the blood flow inside the sinus at a totally invaded lesion. Moreover, collateral veins enveloped in a meningioma with their confluence points of the venous sinus were easily observed on 3D-SPACE images.
   CONCLUSION: With an integrative presentation of parasinus meningioma, wall invasion, lumen patency, and collateral veins, high-resolution 3D-SPACE imaging provides a reliable technique to accurately assess venous sinus invasion preoperatively.

AB OBJECTIVE: To introduce a modified percutaneous endoscopic lumbar diskectomy (PELD) technique to remove extraforaminal disk herniation at the L5-S1 segment, including the technical essentials and preliminary results.
   METHODS: The geometric parameters of the transverse process, facet joint, and sacrum (IFS) space based on imaging examination were measured in 100 common patients. The technical essentials, including working cannula placement and disk removal involved in the technique, were described. Ten cases (7 men and 3 women) with extraforaminal disk herniation at L5-S1 were surgically treated with the PELD technique through the TFS space from June 2015 to March 2017.
   RESULTS: The maximum diameter of the TFS space varied from 2.73 to 11.81 mm (6.84 +/- 2.01 mm) on the left and 3.00 to 10.47 mm (7.02 +/- 2.05 mm) on the right. The distance of possible skin entry points from midline varied from 33.28 to 84.18 mm, and the distance of external iliac vessels to skin varied from 70.05 to 119.14 mm. All 10 patients who underwent the modified PELD technique were back to previous activities in 1 month. Visual analog scale (VAS) or Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores reduced to 2.5 +/- 2.0 or 25.4 +/- 10.8 from 7.5 +/- 1.3 or 75.2 +/- 13.3, respectively, 1 day after operation. At 30 days after the operation, the VAS score was 1.0 +/- 0.6 and ODI score was 10.2 +/- 3.2. No neurologic deficit or surgical site infection occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: We introduced a modified PELD technique to remove extraforaminal disk herniation at the L5-S1 segment. This technique was less invasive, effective, and safe. We also summarized a detailed protocol to identify and remove the herniated disk for nerve protection.

AB OBJECTIVES: Dizziness often happens in patients with chronic neck pain with only cervical disc degeneration but without cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy. We prospectively selected a series of patients who showed cervical disc degeneration with concomitant chronic neck pain and intractable dizziness who did not respond to conservative treatment to test a new diagnostic method for this dizziness, to analyze the results of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery based on the test, and to explore its pathogenesis.
   METHODS: Seventy-seven patients who had a transient neck pain and dizziness relief after injection of bupivacaine into a suspected disc were included in the study. In total, 52 underwent ACDF as surgery group, and 25 refused surgery and accepted conservative treatments as conservative group from June, 2015 to October, 2016 with subsequent follow-up to 1 year. The outcomes were visual analogue scale for neck pain, Neck Disability Index, and intensity and frequency of dizziness. During ACDF, the 72 specimens of degenerative cervical discs were collected to determine the innervation in degenerative cervical discs immunohistochemically.
   RESULTS: After surgery, the patients experienced a significant reduction in neck pain and dizziness. Symptomatic relief in surgery group was obviously better than conservative group at each time point of follow-up (P = 0.001). Ruffini corpuscles and substance P-positive free nerve fibers were obviously increased in the number and deeply ingrown into the inner degenerative cervical discs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical and immunohistochemical studies strongly suggest that chronic neck pain and intractable dizziness in this series of patients stem from the degenerative cervical discs.

AB PURPOSE: We have introduced a method of modified posterior short-segment pedicle screw fixation and evaluated its clinical effects in treating lumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurological deficits.
   METHODS: The data from 22 patients with lumbar burst fracture and incomplete neurological deficits who had undergone modified posterior short-segment instrumentation with Schanz screw fixation from January 2012 to February 2018 in our clinic were evaluated in the present retrospective study. All Schanz screws were implanted in an oblique downward direction into the vertebrae above and below the injured vertebra (insertion depth, 90%-100%). The implants were removed similar to 1 year after surgery. Neurological function, back pain, anterior and posterior body height ratio, kyphosis angle, percentage of canal compromise, fracture severity, and treatment-related complications were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all 22 patients. No infection, instrument loosening or failure, or breakage was observed. Statistically significant improvements with regard to the anterior body height (P < 0.05) and posterior body height (P < 0.05) ratios, kyphosis angle, and percentage of canal compromise (P < 0.05) were observed at 1 week postoperatively or the final follow-up visit. No correction loss had occurred at the final follow-up examination. Postoperatively, all patients with neurological deficits had functional improvement equivalent to grade on the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale and fracture union. Back pain was greatly improved postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment Schanz screw fixation implanted in an oblique downward direction seems to be a promising method for lumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurological deficits because it provided good clinical and radiographic outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors that are predictive of nonhome discharge after elective posterior cervical fusion.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who underwent elective posterior cervical fusion using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2010 to 2014. Patients were divided into 2 groups: home discharge and nonhome discharge. Univariate analysis was performed to compare incidence of 30-day postoperative complications between groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify complications that were predictive of nonhome discharge.
   RESULTS: The cohort included 2875 patients; 24.1% were discharged to a nonhome facility, including skilled and nonskilled care facilities, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and rehabilitation facilities. Nonhome discharge was associated with higher rates of 30-day pulmonary complication, cardiac complication, venous thromboembolism, urinary tract infection, blood transfusion, sepsis, and reoperation. Significant predictors of nonhome discharge were wound complication (odds ratio [OR] = 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.80; P = 0.024), pulmonary complication (OR = 3.61; 95% CI, 1.96-6.63; P < 0.001), cardiac complication (OR = 6.13; 95% CI, 1.61-23.4; P = 0.008), venous thromboembolism (OR = 2.97; 95% CI, 1.43-6.19; P = 0.004), urinary tract infection (OR = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.50-4.82; P < 0.001), blood transfusion (OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.20-2.39; P = 0.003), sepsis (OR = 2.75; 95% CI, 1.25-6.02; P = 0.012), and prolonged length of stay (OR = 4.07; 95% CI, 3.34-4.95; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of patients who are at high risk for nonhome discharge is important to implement early comprehensive discharge planning protocols and minimize hospital-acquired conditions related to prolonged length of stay and associated health care costs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report on our experience with the Elekta Extend system, a relocatable frame system used in patients with brain metastases for single-session, hypofractionated, or staged hypofractionated Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS); and the evaluation of its efficacy.
   METHODS: From March 2014 to September 2016, 856 patients with brain metastases underwent GKRS at our hospital. Of them, 35 patients who were retrospectively investigated, were selected for treatment with GKRS using the relocatable frame system. Individualized treatment strategy was chosen according to prior treatment history, number, size and location of tumor, or tumor harboring gene mutation.
   RESULTS: Thirty-two (91.4%) patients underwent treatment with hypofractionated GKRS or staged hypofractionated GKRS, whereas 3 (8.6%) patients underwent single session GKRS. The mean radial setup difference from the reference measurements was 0.50 +/- 0.16 mm. The median follow-up time after GKRS with the Extend system was 12 months (range, 1-45 months). The median overall survival time was 12 months (95% confidence interval 6.43-17.57). On multivariable analysis, performance status and extracranial metastases were independently prognostic factors for overall survival. Radiation necrosis developed in 4 cases (11.4%) during the follow-up period (2 with common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2 and 2 with its grade 3).
   CONCLUSIONS: The relocatable frame system can maintain submillimetric accuracy and provide tailored treatment option with reasonable tumor control and good survival benefits in selected patients with brain metastases. Especially, hypofractionated GKRS or staged hypofractionated GKRS with noninvasive frame is a safe and effective treatment option for large brain metastases or tumor adjacent to eloquent structures.

AB BACKGROUND: Pulling a retriever stent after several minutes of waiting time is a popular technique in mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever, but little data exist on the actual effects of waiting after stent deployment.
   METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of consecutive 210 patients separated into 2 groups, a waiting after stent deployment group and a nonwaiting group. A comparative analysis was performed in terms of clinical and radiologic outcomes and complications with respect to multiple categories.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes between the 2 groups. However, compared with the nonwaiting group, the waiting group had a higher rate of one-pass procedures, a lower mean number of stent passages, and a shorter procedure time (P = 0.021, 0.014, and 0.004, respectively). The proportion of patients with successful recanalization was also higher in the waiting group (P = 0.038). In multivariate analysis, waiting after stent deployment was a predictive factor for successful recanalization (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.110-2.090; P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Waiting after stent deployment can lead to a more successful recanalization with a smaller number of stent passages and less distal emboli. More randomized controlled trials are needed to support these findings.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine role of lordosis in cervical spine injuries using a novel competing risk analysis model.
   METHODS: The first subgroup of published experiments (n = 20) subjected upright human cadaver head-neck specimens to impact loading. The natural lordosis was removed. The second (n= 21) and third (n =10) subgroups of published tests subjected inverted specimens to head impact loading. Lordosis was preserved in these 2 subgroups. Using axial force and age as variables, competing risks analysis techniques were used to determine the role of lordosis in the risk of bone-only, ligament-only, and bone and ligament injuries.
   RESULTS: Bony injuries were focused more at 1 level to a straightened spine, and ligament injuries were spread around multiple levels. Age was not a significant (P < 0.05) covariate. A straightened spine had 3.23 times higher risk of bony injuries than a lordotic spine. The spine with maintained lordosis had 1.14 times higher risk of ligament injuries, and 2.67 times higher risk of bone and ligament injuries than a spine without lordosis (i.e., preflexed column).
   CONCLUSIONS: Increased risk of bony injuries in a preflexed spine and ligament injuries in a lordotic spine may have implications for military personnel, as continuous use of helmets in the line of duty affects the natural curvature; astronauts, as curvatures are less lordotic after missions; and civilian patients with spondylotic myelopathy who use head protective devices, as curvatures may change over time in addition to the natural aging process.

DT Article
DE Complication; Cranioplasty; Implant exposure; Mechanism; Pressure
   gradient; Titanium mesh exposure
ID DEFECT RECONSTRUCTION; CRANIOPLASTY; CRANIECTOMY
AB OBJECTIVE: Titanium mesh implants (TMIs) are used for various purposes in craniotomy. Although delayed implant exposure and thinning of the overlying skin are well-known complications, the mechanism has not yet been elucidated. We reviewed our cases and propose a mechanism for TMI exposure.
   METHODS: From 2009 to 2018, we treated 14 patients with delayed titanium implant exposure after craniotomy. The exposed titanium implant was a TMI in 4 patients, a titanium mesh plate in 6 patients, and a titanium fixation plate with holes in 4 patients. We reviewed the preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and operative findings.
   RESULTS: The interval between craniotomy and implant exposure was 13 years (range, 5-27). Implant exposure occurred at the temporal region in 7 patients, frontal region in 6 patients, and parietal region in 1 patient. The skin ulcer size ranged from 025 to 10 cm(2) (mean, 1.95). In the patients with TMI exposure, the dura was expanded, and no residual epidural space was identified on the CT scans; however, epidural dead space was revealed on the CT scan in the patients with titanium mesh plate or titanium fixation plate exposure.
   CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the key factor resulting in delayed titanium mesh exposure is the pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the intracranial space. Fluctuation of this gradient exerts dynamic stress on the tissue in the mesh holes and the adjacent tissue, resulting in tissue damage and implant exposure.

AB BACKGROUND: In academic specialties such as neurosurgery, bibliometrics are often used to guide readers, academic institutes, and researchers to make objective assessment of journals. Recently, new indices have been developed to overcome the shortcomings of the widely used Impact Factor. The objective of our study was to investigate the correlations among 6 of the commonly used bibliometric indices (Impact Factor, SCImago Journal indicator, SCOPUS h-index, Google h-index, Eigenfactor, Article Influence Score) in neurosurgical and spinal surgical journals.
   METHODS: A list of all neurosurgical and spinal surgical journals was compiled using the databases of SCOPUS, Clarivate Analytics (Thomson Reuters), and National Library of Medicine Catalog. Journals that are not surgically oriented, non-English journals, and nursing journals were excluded. Bivariate Spearman ranking correlation tests were performed.
   RESULTS: Fifty-four journals were included, of which 14 were spine themed. High positive correlations were obtained among the bibliometric indices of neurosurgical (nonspinal) journals (P < 0.05 in all pairs). Median values were 1.54, 0.66, 53, 25, 0.0035, and 0.46 for Impact Factor, SCImago Journal rank indicator, SCOPUS h-index, Google h-index, Eigenfactor, and Article Influence Score, respectively. However, the correlations for spinal surgical journals were more variable, likely because of the small sample size.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the different mathematical basis among the citation-based bibliometric indices studied, they have strong correlations in ranking neurosurgical journals. This study provides evidence that the newer indices may be used interchangeably with the Impact Factor in this context, and they may, theoretically, mitigate some the shortcomings of the Impact Factor.

AB BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response plays a vital role in the pathologic mechanism of intracerebral hemorrhage. It recently has been reported that neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could represent a novel composite inflammatory marker for predicting the prognosis of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). However, in considering the effects of surgical evacuation on the initiation of inflammatory responses, the relationship between NLR and functional outcome of patients with ICH after surgical treatment is still controversial. Here, we aimed to assess the predictive value of admission NLR and other available laboratory parameters for 90-day outcome of patients with ICH undergoing neurosurgical treatment.
   METHODS: In total, 104 patients with acute ICH admitted to West China Hospital from October 2016 to January 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Admission absolute neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and white blood count were extracted from electronic medical records of patents with ICH. The associations between outcome and laboratory biomarkers were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The comparison of predictive power of independent predictors was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves.
   RESULTS: In total, 59 patients with ICH who underwent surgical treatment exhibited unfavorable outcomes, which was associated with greater admission NLR (odds ratio [OR] 0.692, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.518-0.925, P = 0.01; OR 1.148, 95% CI 1.078-1.222, P < 0.01; OR 1.215, 95% CI 1.015-1.454, P = 0.03), lower Glasgow Coma Scale score, and larger hematoma. NLR showed the best predictive power by comparing with other laboratorial variables (area under the curve 0.668, 95% CI 0.569-0.757, P < 0.01) and also was found to linearly correlate with Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission, hematoma volume, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, and hydrocephalus. Meanwhile, the best predictive cutoff point of 6.46 for NLR also was identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: Other than the association of prognosis of patients with ICH, NLR exhibited potential independent predictive ability for 90-day functional outcomes of patients with ICH after surgery.

ID HEMATOMA EXPANSION; GLUCOSE; INTERLEUKIN-1-BETA; SECRETION; CELLS
AB OBJECTIVES: The prognostic value of admission serum glucose for early hematoma growth in patients with intracranial hemorrhage remains controversial. Island sign is a novel imaging predictor for early hematoma growth, implying multifocal active bleeding. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential associations between hyperglycemia and early hematoma expansion in patients with intracranial hemorrhage with or without island sign.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical characteristics and radiologic parameters were retrospectively obtained from the electronic medical record. Admission blood glucose was measured within 24 hours from disease onset. Hematoma expansion and island sign were estimated by 2 experienced reviewers from initial and follow-up computed tomography scans. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations of hematoma expansion and island sign on other clinical variables.
   RESULTS: In total, 187 patients were enrolled in current study; 61 patients were presented to have early hematoma expansion, whereas 32 exhibited island sign. The average blood glucose level was 7.64 mmol/L among all patients. The multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the time from ictus to initial computed tomography scan, Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission, hematoma volume, island sign, and hyperglycemia were associated with hematoma expansion, whereas only admission serum glucose and hematoma size were associated with island sign.
   CONCLUSIONS: Admission serum glucose is associated with hematoma growth and prevalence of island sign, respectively. These results indicated that elevated blood glucose level plays a pathological role in active bleeding. Further studies concerning exact molecular signal pathway are urgently required.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report our single-center experience in the treatment of dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar aneurysms.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data, including clinical features, strategies of managing aneurysms, and follow-up results, of 12 patients who were treated at the Tainjin Huanhu Hospital.
   RESULTS: Of the 12 patients, 1 patient was treated with medication, 4 patients were treated using stent reconstruction, and 7 patients were treated via revascularization (open surgery). The clinical symptoms of the patients who were treated with medication and stent reconstruction were stable. The patients who were treated with revascularization suffered from pneumonia, and 1 patient who presented with intracranial hematoma was treated via a second craniotomy. One patient suffered from new cerebral infraction. Postoperative follow-up from 5 to 67 months indicated that 2 patients (16.7%) had died (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 6), and both were treated with revascularization. Seven patients had mRS scores of 0-2, and the other 3 patients had mRS scores of 4-5.
   CONCLUSIONS: If the condition of the patients is stable and benign, they can be treated with medication or stent reconstruction. Given the serious complications that can be caused by open surgery, care must be taken when selecting the patients to be treated using open surgery, but more studies are needed to support this conclusion. The key points are to avoid aneurysm thrombosis and maintain patency of the perforators.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term functional and survival outcomes of patients with glioma after intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) application.
   METHODS: A total of 856 patients with glioma, who underwent tumor resection between October 2010 and March 2016, were included in this retrospective cohort study. All patients were stratified into IONM (439 patients) and non-IONM groups (417 patients). The primary outcome measured was overall survival (OS), and the secondary outcome measured was rate of late neurologic deficits. Analyses were performed using univariate tests and multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model.
   RESULTS: The 2 cohorts were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics. Univariate survival analysis showed longer OS in the IONM group than that in the non-IONM group (P = 0.036), especially in patients with high-grade astrocytic tumor (P = 0.034). The IONM group showed a lower rate of neurologic deficits than did the non-IONM group. Multivariate analysis showed that IONM was a favorable factor of OS (odds ratio, 0.776; P = 0.046) and late neurologic function (odds ratio, 0.583; P = 0.039). Dominant hemispheric and eloquent location of glioma had no association with OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Application of IONM is beneficial to long-term functional and oncologic outcomes of patients with glioma.

ID INTERNAL CAROTID-ARTERY; DEVICE
AB OBJECTIVE: To explore whether computed morphologic features can be used as independent predictors of incomplete occlusion of aneurysms treated with the Pipeline embolization device.
   METHODS: From January 2016 to September 2017, 58 patients with 58 aneurysms were treated with the Pipeline embolization device. Aneurysms were manually segmented from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine file, and we calculated 16 shape features voxel by voxel on the segmented aneurysm image. Along with 13 other clinical and radiographic variables, we performed univariate and multivariate analysis to explore predictors of incomplete occlusion.
   RESULTS: At last angiographic follow-up (median 6.2 months), complete occlusion was achieved in 41 aneurysms (70.7%). In multivariate analysis, malapposition of stent (odds ratio = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.32; P = 0.004) and higher elongation value (odds ratio = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.17; P < 0.001) were independently associated with incomplete occlusion of aneurysms. Compared with aneurysms with complete occlusion, incompletely occluded aneurysms had higher elongation values (median 0.890 vs. 0.766; P < 0.001); the optimal cutoff value of elongation for occlusion status classification was 0.862. Predicting accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the curve of the logistic regression model were 0.879, 0.902, 0.824, 0.925, 0.778, and 0.872.
   CONCLUSIONS: Malapposition of stent and higher elongation value were independent negative predictors of aneurysm occlusion following flow diversion.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clarify the relationship between histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) expression and the prognosis as well as the grade of patients with glioma.
   METHODS: The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was profiled to examine the HDAC3 expression in glioma and normal glial cell lines. An Oncomine database analysis and prognosis analysis were performed. The correlation between World Health Organization (WHO) grade and HDAC3 was analyzed by Spearman rank correlation test. A meta-analysis was performed to confirm the conclusion.
   RESULTS: HDAC3 RNA overexpression in glioma cell lines was detected (P < 0.05). Four data sets were screened from the Oncomine database and showed that the expression level of HDAC3 was consistently higher in glioma than in normal tissue (P < 0.001). The prognostic analysis of 325 glioma samples from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas showed that patients with low HDAC3 expression had significantly better overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) than did patients with high HDAC3 expression [hazard ratio [HR], 1.992; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.490e2.662; P < 0.0001 and HR, 1.874; 95% CI, 1.412e2.487; P < 0.0001, respectively]. Both the WHO grade III group and the WHO grade IV group expressed significantly higher messenger RNA (mRNA) level than did the WHO grade II group (P < 0.05). Four cohort studies consisting of 490 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled data of subgroup analysis showed significantly longer OS in low HDAC3 mRNA level [HR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.80e6.37; P [0.0002].
   CONCLUSIONS: HDAC3 mRNA was expressed more in glioma than in the normal glial cell line. Low HDAC3 mRNA expression levels predicted better OS. HDAC3 expression could be a biomarker to discriminate glioma grade.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken primarily to research transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) for the prediction of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPAs) invasion and recurrence of tumor samples and the relations between quantitatively determined markers and clinical characters.
   METHODS: We studied 104 patients, including 59 patients without recurrence and 45 patients with recurrence (9 patients with one surgery and 36 patients operated twice, both tumors being studied). All tissues were immunostained for TGF-beta 1 and WIF1 using tissue microarrays and confirmed with real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot.
   RESULTS: We found that invasion, TGF-beta 1, and WIF1 were significantly associated with recurrence and that age was associated with low expression of TGF-beta 1 and WIF1 (P < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the expression of the 2 proteins between the noninvasive and the invasive groups. The expression of TGF-beta 1 and WIFI in primary tumors in the recurrence group was lower than in the nonrecurrence group (P < 0.001). In the 36 paired primary or recurrent tumors, the expression of TGF-beta 1 and WIF1 in recurrent tumors was higher than the expression of primary tumors, which was confirmed with qRT-PCR and Western blot. Therefore, TGF-beta 1 and WIF1 seem to be related to recurrence or progression of pituitary adenomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: The expression of TGF-beta 1 and WIF1 in NFPAs correlated with cell proliferation and recurrence potential. They may be good markers of progressive behavior in NFPAs; however, the biologic mechanism needs further study.

   PATTERNS; VELOCITY
AB Background: Long-term follow-up of children treated for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is limited, as the examination of factors potentially contributing to recovery is also limited. This study aimed to examine whether the recovery of neurocognitive function is achieved at four years post-adenotonsillectomy for SDB in children and whether body mass status influences the outcome.
   Methods: This prospective longitudinal study of 3- to 12-year-old children recruited from an otolaryngology clinic compared cognitive performance, sleep, ventilation, and body mass before and at four years post-adenotonsillectomy in children with SDB and compared these parameters to those of untreated healthy controls during the same time points.
   Results: Children were categorised as normal-weight control (n = 33), normal-weight SDB (n = 18), or overweight/obese SDB (n = 11). Body mass did not significantly differ at four year follow-up compared to the baseline in any subgroup (p > 0.05), and groups were matched on the basis of age and gender. Despite improved sleep and nocturnal ventilation at four years post-adenotonsillectomy, little gain was observed in neurocognitive performance in either nonobese or overweight/obese children with SDB. Overweight/obese children with SDB displayed worse neurocognitive performance than all other children.
   Conclusion: Adenotonsillectomy improves nocturnal ventilation and sleep quality but not neurocognitive performance in the long term. Excess body mass may place children with SDB at increased risk of neurocognitive performance deficits. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objectives: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) contributes to all-cause mortality. An American Academy of Sleep Medicine task force is focusing on improving detection and categorization of OSA symptoms and severity to promote screening, assessment, and diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to psychometrically compare measures used in OSA screening (Berlin, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), STOP Bang) and a portable sleep monitor (PSM) to apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and levels from polysomnogram (PSG).
   Methods: An observational, cross-sectional design was used. Patients referred to a sleep specialist were enrolled at initial sleep evaluation. Participants completed measures used in OSA screening, then sent home for one night using PSM. PSGs were ordered by the physician and AHI results were obtained from the medical record.
   Results: Participants (N = 170) were enrolled in the study. Almost all participants completed the OSA measures, approximately half-completed PSM measurement, and the majority completed laboratory PSG. The STOP Bang had the highest levels of sensitivity; the ESS had the lowest. The ESS had the highest specificity and reliability levels; the STOP Bang had the lowest. The PSM measure had the highest positive predictive value (PPV) and the strongest psychometric properties of the screening measures.
   Conclusions: The STOP Bang was the preferred self-report OSA screening measure because of high levels of sensitivity. The ESS was the least desirable measure. PSM measurement consistently predicted the presence of OSA but at the expense of low sensitivity at AHI levels >= 30. This expands the knowledge of validity testing of screening measures used for OSA. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rationale: Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, both recognition of OSA and acceptance of treatment are suboptimal. Current data on CPAP initiation at a population level is lacking.
   Objectives: The objectives were to determine the rate of CPAP initiations in Ontario, Canada (population similar to 13,000,000), and to profile these individuals over time.
   Methods: We conducted a population based cohort study between 2006 and 2013. All adults who initiated CPAP for OSA were included. Patient characteristics, comorbidities and health care utilization at the time of CPAP initiation were derived from provincial health administrative data. Changes in patient characteristics over time were assessed.
   Results: Over eight years, 216,514 individuals initiated CPAP therapy in comparison to 802,188 individuals who underwent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) during that time. The rate of new CPAP initiations increased from 18.6/10,000 in 2006 to 28.7/10,000 in 2008 and then plateaued with an annual increase of less than 1/10,000 from 2008 to 2013. More women and middle aged (50+) individuals initiated CPAP as did more low income Ontarians. Comorbidities were common and the frequency of congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and cancer increased during the study period.
   Conclusions: Over an eight year period CPAP initiation appears to have plateaued in spite of increasing PSG testing; however, those receiving treatment with CPAP are increasingly complex and a greater proportion are women. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is currently considered as a unique condition, but it has been suggested that the prevalence, clinical presentation, and associated conditions may differ by sex or by menopausal status in women. We aimed to assess the prevalence of SDB and associated comorbidities in pre- and postmenopausal women compared with men.
   Methods: Participants of the population-based HypnoLaus Sleep Cohort study underwent polysomnography in their home environment and had extensive phenotyping for diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and depression.
   Results: A total of 2121 subjects (age 40-85 [59 +/- 11] years, body mass index 25.6 +/- 4.1 kg/m(2), 1024 men and 1097 women [769 postmenopausal]) were included. SDB prevalence based on an apnea-hypopnea index of >5/h, >15/11, >20/11, and >= 30/h, respectively, was 83.8%, 49.7%, 37.5%, and 22.0% in men; 35.1%, 8.6%, 3.3%, and 1.3% in premenopausal women; and 71.6%, 29.4%, 20.7%, and 10.1% in postmenopausal women. In multivariable models, SDB severity was significantly associated with hypertension in women (p = 0.007) (mainly in postmenopausal women) but not in men (p = 0.065), with diabetes in men (p = 0.021) but not in women overall (p = 0.853) or in postmenopausal women (p = 0.725), with metabolic syndrome in men (p = 0.002) and women (p < 0.001), and with depression in women (p = 0.007) but not in men (p = 0.853).
   Conclusion: SDB prevalence in this middle-aged to-older population was high, particularly in men and postmenopausal women. SDB was associated with hypertension and depression exclusively in women, whereas an association with diabetes was present only in men. These findings suggest that the SDB definition and management recommendations may need to be adapted to these groups' specificities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Social jetlag, ie, the mismatch between biological and social timing, has been suggested to induce obesity and cardiometabolic abnormalities. Yet, no study has currently linked social jetlag to metabolic syndrome (MetS) among Asians. The aim of this study was to investigate the cross-sectional association of social jetlag with MetS in a Japanese working population.
   Methods: Participants were 1164 employees, aged 18-78 years, who completed a health survey at a periodic checkup. Social jetlag was calculated as the difference in hours of midpoint of sleep times between weekdays and weekends. MetS was defined according to the Joint Interim Statement criteria. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between social jetlag and MetS with adjustment for potential confounding variables.
   Results: Greater social jetlag was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of having MetS. The multivariable adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) for >= 2 h of social jetlag was 1.92 (1.01-3.67) compared to those with <1 h of social jetlag. Of the components of MetS, greater social jetlag was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of having high waist circumference; the multivariable adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) for >= 2 h of social jetlag was 2.26 (1.33-3.84) compared to those with <1 h of social jetlag.
   Conclusion: Social jetlag may be associated with an increased likelihood of having MetS among non-shift workers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Sleep disorders, chronic pain, and fatigue have been long-standing torments in most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this review, we attempted to explore whether these nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased mortality in patients with CKD.
   Method: Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE (PubMed, 1966-2018), EMBASE (1974-2018), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. All prospective or retrospective studies were considered eligible if they were cohort or observational studies and the final outcome was all-cause death or mortality.
   Results: We ultimately included 18 studies (12 studies on sleep disorders, three studies on chronic pain, and three studies on fatigue) in our review. Pooled analysis of all studies indicated that patients with sleep disorders, chronic pain, and fatigue had increased risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30-1.66, p < 0.0001; RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.27-1.31, p < 0.0001; RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.23-1.70, p < 0.0001, respectively). Pooled results from four studies indicated that dialysis patients with sleep-disordered breathing had increased cardiovascular disease outcomes (RR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.74-3.44, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Sleep disorders, chronic pain, and fatigue are remarkably associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. Large clinical randomized controlled trials are required to further confirm the results of our meta-analysis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objective: In this exploratory, double-blind, longitudinal sham-controlled trial of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) for military personnel with post concussive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), self-reports and objective measures of sleep-wake disturbances were assessed and compared to normals.
   Methods: Self-reports consisting of Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), sleep diary, screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) risk, restless legs syndrome (RLS), cataplexy, and objective actigraphic measures of sleep-wake were obtained on 71 military personnel with mTBI [baseline, 13 weeks and six months post-randomization (post-intervention)], of which 35 met post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) criteria, and 75 healthy volunteers (baseline). Baseline between-group and follow-up changes from baseline overall and within subgroups were evaluated. Mild TBI was defined as consisting of head injury associated loss of consciousness (<24 h), post-traumatic amnesia, and neurological deficits.
   Results: Sleep quality by self-reports was markedly degraded in the mTBI group at baseline compared to a normative cohort; insomnia 87.3 versus 2.8%, OSA risk 70% versus 1.3%, RLS 32.4% versus and 2.7%. (all p-values <0.001), but actigraphy measures did not differentiate between groups. HBO2 compared to sham treatment improved self-reports of PSQI sleep measures, reports (five out of eight at 13-weeks and two out of eight at six-months). However, other sleep-wake measures were not different.
   Conclusions: Perceived sleep quality was markedly disrupted in mTBI military personnel and sleep-wake disturbances were prevalent compared to a normative cohort. HBO2 relative to sham improved some measures of sleep quality on the PSQI, but other measures of sleep were not significantly different. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Combined insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea has been the focus of considerable research with respect to its health effects. A related issue is whether sleep disturbances in combination with snoring might exert effects on objective sleep variables in the non-clinical general population. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the polysomnographical characteristics of individuals who had sought medical help for both disturbed sleep and for snoring. No previous work of this type has been carried out.
   Method: For this study we used a representative set of data of 384 women with one night of in-home PSG. We identified those individuals who had sought medical help for sleep problems (SL), individuals that had sought help for snoring (SN), as well as those that had sought help for either both (Combined), or for neither (Control).
   Results: Our results yielded an N of 46, 16, 21, and 301 individuals, respectively. A one-factor analysis of variance showed significant main effects on N1% (F = 10.2, p < 0.001), N3% (F = 2.7, p < 0.05), AHI/h (F = 5.5, p < 0.001), and a delta power measure (F = 3.8, p < 0.05). The combined group showed significantly higher levels than the other groups for N1% (29% vs < 21%), AHI/h (19/h vs < 10/h) and lower levels for N3%, and a measure of delta power. Reported sleep quality measures did not show the same pattern, since the highest/lowest value were found for either the group presenting snoring alone or sleep problems alone.
   Conclusion: We concluded that individuals who had sought help for both insomnia and snoring showed impaired sleep in terms of PSG and that this was not reflected in ratings of sleep or health. This suggests that simultaneous sleep disturbances and snoring may potentiate each other to cause impaired sleep, yet the mechanism still needs to be elucidated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Study objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate circadian rhythm and sleep complaints in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) as determined by diurnal saliva melatonin and cortisol as well as activity measurements and subjective sleep quality.
   Methods: Fourteen patients with cervical SCI (cSCI), six patients with thoracic SCI (tSCI) and eight able-bodied controls all underwent two consecutive weeks wearing a wrist actigraph in addition to filling out a sleep diary. During one 24-h period, cortisol and melatonin were measured at 4-h intervals. Furthermore, participants' sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and their overall daytime sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).
   Results: The cSCI group demonstrated lower melatonin levels compared with the tSCI group and the controls at the 24:00 and 04:00 time points. Moreover, at one time point the tSCI group had a higher cortisol level than the cSCI group and the controls. In addition, baseline systolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation were significantly lower in the cSCI group. No differences were found in activity measurements or self-reported sleep quality.
   Conclusions: Individuals with cSCI demonstrate reduced melatonin secretion compared with tSCI individuals, but not in other circadian measures. This supports an involvement of melatonergic cervical fibers associated with the cervical lesion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the psychological status of patients with bruxism and to explore the potential relationship between psychological status and rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA), since the basic manifestation of sleep bruxism is RMMA.
   Methods: Twenty-five patients (nine males, 16 females, and mean age 27.84 +/- 5.60) who self-reported having SB and 25 normal subjects were randomly recruited. Fifty subjects filled out the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) to assess their psychopathological status. SB was diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG), and RMMA was recorded based on the results of PSG.
   Results: In this study we detected 15.89 +/- 4.23 RMMA episodes per hour in normal subjects, whereas 41.23 +/- 16.78 RMMA episodes per hour were recorded in patients with SB, which was nearly three times of the former group with statistical significance (P = 0.001). Paired t-test revealed significant differences between SB patients and normal subjects in any of the SCL-90 subscales (P = 0.001). Regarding total psychopathological scores, 10 of the 25 SB patients endorsed scores higher than 160, and the positive rate was 40%. In addition, obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, paranoid ideation and psychoticism were all statistically associated with RMMA (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Within the limitations of the study, we found that patients with sleep bruxism tend to have poor psychological status, and obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, paranoid ideation and psychoticism are related to onset of SB.

AB Several hypnotic agents commonly recommended for improving sleep at sea level are discouraged at high altitude. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs prescribed for improving sleep quality in patients with acute exposure to high altitudes by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. An electronic search was executed for randomized controlled trials comparing drug treatments with placebo and no-treatment conditions, which used objective sleep parameters or subjective sleep quality evaluations. Eight studies (152 participants) were included in the meta-analysis and involved trials using acetazolamide, temazepam, zolpidem, zaleplon, and theophylline. Generally, the nonbenzodiazepines were reported to be superior and safe in improving sleep quality. Participants who were administered zaleplon or zolpidem reported a significant improvement in subjective sleep quality. As measured by polysomnography, both zaleplon and zolpidem improved the total sleep time, sleep efficiency index, and stage 4 sleep duration, whereas they decreased the wake-after-sleep onset without impairing ventilation. In contrast, temazepam was not superior to placebo in terms of quicker onset of sleep and better sleep quality. On the other hand, acetazolamide and theophylline both reduced the sleep efficiency index. The present results favored zaleplon and zolpidem in improving both the objective and subjective quality of sleep without impairing ventilation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To address the question of how representative subjects studied in hypnotic clinical trials are of the broader insomnia population, this study assessed initial contact rates and reasons for inclusion and exclusion during recruitment to an efficacy trial and to a safety trial of Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved hypnotics.
   Methods: Otherwise heathy persons meeting Diagnostic Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, Revised (DSM-IVR) criteria for insomnia were recruited. In one study, persons 32-65 yrs, were invited to a 12 month trial of nightly use of zolpidem or placebo. In the other, persons 21-64 yrs with driver's licenses were recruited to test the effects of a hypnotic on live on-the-road driving ability. In both studies screening was conducted through an initial telephone interview followed by a clinic visit.
   Results: In the United States (US) study 13% (n = 410) of 3180 initial contacts and in the Netherlands (NL) study 67% (n = 53) of the 79 initial contacts proceeded to the clinic visit. Of those at clinic 25% of US and 37% of NL participants failed to meet additional insomnia criteria. Mental health exclusions accounted for 24% of US and 23% of NL participants and medical problems accounted for 23% of US and 9% NL exclusions. Finally 20% of US and 26% of NL participants were excluded for drug use/abuse histories. After all screening 4% of the initial US contacts and 0% of the NL contacts entered the study.
   Conclusions: These data suggest persons entering insomnia hypnotic clinical trials are a highly selected sample that is unlikely to be representative of the broad insomnia population or the population of potential medication users. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   DISORDERS; INSOMNIA; APNEA; SPECTROSCOPY; DEPRESSION; DURATION
AB Objective: Hemodialysis (HD) patients are exposed to dysregulated fluid balance which can lead to overhydration. Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness are particularly common in these patients, however the relationship between fluid status and sleep quality and daytime sleepiness has not yet been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the correlations between fluid status and sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in HD patients.
   Method: This cross-sectional study included 115 HD patients and 30 healthy control subjects from the HD center of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital. Fluid compartments [total body water (TBW)], extracellular water (ECW)] and overhydration index (OH) were analyzed by multifrequency bio-impedance (BCM). Overhydration was defined as OH/ECW >= 7%. HD patients were divided into an overhydration group and non overhydration group according to OH/ECW. Sleep quality was assessed by the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and excessive daytime sleepiness was evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).
   Results: The prevalence rate of fluid overload in HD patients was 65.2%. Poor sleep quality (PSQI >= 5) and excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS >= 11) were significantly higher in HD patients compared with the healthy controls [6 (3, 10) vs.2.11 +/- 1.59, p = 0.000; 3 (0, 6) vs.1.68 +/- 1.07, p = 0.045]. Furthermore, the PSQI scores were higher in HD patients with overhydration (7.8 +/- 4.5 vs. 4.8 +/- 3.2, p = 0.000). The component scores 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the PSQI showed significant differences between the overhydration and non overhydration groups. The ESS scores did not show differences between the two groups (3.9 +/- 4.1 vs. 3.3 +/- 3.5, p = 0.508). OH was correlated with Systolic BP and Diastolic BP, and additionally was an independent predictor of poor sleep quality.
   Conclusion: Fluid overload is significantly linked with poor quality of sleep in HD patients, however there is no association with excessive daytime sleepiness. Our study provides new insight into possible treatment strategies. Future studies should examine the effects of optimizing fluid status on quality of sleep. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: To study different factors that are associated with fatal sleepiness-related motor vehicle accidents (FSMVA) and in other types of fatal motor vehicle accidents (FMVA) in Finland.
   Methods: All FMVA that were caused by falling asleep at the wheel (FSMVA) during the years 2005-2014 were investigated using OTI (Finnish Crash Data Institute) data. The control group consisted of 136 drivers who died in other types of FMVA in 2013. A total of 258 accidents were investigated.
   Results: The mean age of the 122 drivers in the FSMVA group was 44 (standard deviation 19) years; there were 100 men (82%) and 22 women. The mean age of the 136 control drivers was 45 (standard deviation 19) years; there were 116 men (85%) and 20 women. Short sleep time (<6 h) during the previous night before the accident was the most prominent independent risk factor for FSMVA compared to other FMVA (p < 0.05). None of the other driver-related factors (diseases, blood alcohol level, illegal drugs, body mass index, medications, age, sex) differed significantly between the two groups.
   Conclusion: Short sleep is a major cause of fatal sleepiness-related motor vehicle accidents. Driver health factors such as sleep apnea or acute/chronic diseases as well as use of sedative medications and drugs are known risk factors for FSMVA, but these factors are associated also with other types of accidents. Healthy individuals are at risk for falling asleep while driving if they are sleep deprived. All drivers should be aware of the importance of adequate sleep. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by reduced muscle endurance and often leads to respiratory complications.
   Objective: A long-term respiratory muscle endurance training (RMET) based on normocapnic hyperpnea was introduced for the first time in MG patients. We investigated RMET effects on respiratory endurance (RE), MG symptoms, lung function and physical fitness and compared the results with a control group (CG).
   Methods: The training period consisted of four weeks intensive training (IT; five 30-min training sessions per week) followed by twelve months maintenance training (MT; five 30-min training sessions over two weeks). Eighteen patients with mild to moderate MG participated as the training group (TG), six patients served as CG. RE, lung function, MG score and physical fitness were tested before and after IT and after three to twelve months of MT.
   Results: Only 12 TG patients completed the entire training period. Thirteen months of training significantly increased RE measured as time until exhaustion (Tlim) to 412% of baseline (P < 0.001). The MG score improved from 0.67 +/- 0.09 to 0.41 +/- 0.1 (p = 0.004), and the number of squats per minute as a measure of physical fitness increased in the TG to 160% of baseline (p = 0.015). While lung function did not change during the training period, we observed a modulation in the breathing pattern at rest with prolonged expiration (122% of baseline, p= 0.028). In addition, TG reported subjective improvements in MG symptoms, respiratory symptoms and physical fitness by 49%, 58% and 64%, respectively (P < 0.001). No significant changes were observed in the CG.
   Conclusion and significance: This is the first controlled long-term RMET study in MG patients. The results demonstrated that this normocapnic hyperpnea training is feasible and beneficial for patients with mild to moderate MG and is a valuable supplement to conventional drug treatment.

   INFLAMMATION; MANNITOL; FRACTION; ADULTS
AB Background: The American Thoracic society (ATS) has suggested using fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) to monitor the level of eosinophilic (EOS) airway inflammation in asthma, but validation of the proposed cut-points is required in real-life populations.
   Objective: To validate FeNO cut-points suggested by ATS in relation to sputum EOS count in a real life population of asthma patients.
   Methods: All patients referred consecutively over a 12-months period for specialist assessment of asthma, were examined with FeNO and induced sputum, and re-examined 12 months later. The predicted values of a positive and a negative test (PPV and NPV) for a cut off >= 3% EOS in sputum were calculated. Change in FeNO was defined in accordance with ATS (> 20% or 10 ppb if FeNO was < 50 ppb).
   Results: 144 adult asthma patients were examined (59% female). Low FeNO (< 25 ppb) at baseline was found in 94 (65%), FeNO between 25 and 50 ppb in 34 (24%) subjects and high FeNO > 50 ppb in 16 (11%) subjects. The PPV for FeNO > 25 ppb and > 50 ppb to predict EOS >= 3% was 45% and 77%, NPV was 88% and 83%. The sensitivity decreased from 70% to 37% at the> 50 ppb cut-off. A significant reduction in FeNO was associated with a reduction in sputum EOS (p = 0.01).
   Conclusion: The findings support the validity of the FeNO cut-points suggested by ATS to monitor eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma. However, in this real-life population, a large proportion of patients had intermediate FeNO values, which may limit the clinical usefulness of the ATS FeNO cut-points.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test panel for nocturnal hypoventilation (NH) and other sleep related respiratory events during monitoring of patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CRF) treated with NIV.
   Methods: We performed a prospective study at Oslo University Hospital. Eligible for inclusion were consecutive adults with CRF due to neuromuscular diseases or chest wall disorders treated with NIV scheduled for a follow-up visit. All patients underwent the screening test panel (clinical evaluation, daytime arterial blood gas (ABG), nocturnal pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) and data from ventilator software) and the reference tests; sleep polygraphy and nocturnal transcutaneous CO2.
   Results: Of 67 patients included, NH was confirmed in 23-50 according to the 3 definitions used for NH, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI(polygraphy)) >= 10 was confirmed in 16 and patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) >= 10% of total recording time in 14. Sensitivity of the combined screening test panel for NH was 87% (95% confidence interval 66-97), 84% (66-95) and 80% (66-90), for abnormal AHI(polygraphy) 91% (59-100) and for PVA 71% (42-92). Sensitivity for NH of SpO(2) was 48% (27-69), 39% (22-58) and 38% (24-53) and of daytime ABG 74% (52-90), 74% (55-88) and 68% (53-80). Sensitivity and specificity of AHI(software) for AHI(polygraphy) > 10 was 93% (68-100) and 92% (81-98) respectively.
   Discussion: In patients treated with long term NIV, screening test panel, nocturnal SpO(2) and daytime ABG all failed to accurately detect NH, underlining the importance of nocturnal monitoring of CO2. AHI(software) accurately identified obstructive events and can be used to modify NIV settings.

AB Background: There is controversy as to whether airflow limitation should be defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/vital capacity (VC) < 0.7 or as FEV1/VC < the lower limit of normal (LLN). The aim was to examine whether different definitions of airflow limitation differ in predicting mortality.
   Methods: Longitudinal prospective study of a national cohort of Swedish workers (199,408 men; 7988 women), aged 20-64 years with spirometry without bronchodilation at baseline followed from 1979 until death, or censorship at 2010.
   Airflow limitation (AL) by Global Obstructive Lung Disease criteria, AL(GOLD), was defined as FEV1/VC < 0.7; AL(LLN) as FEV1/VC < LLN. All all-cause, COPD and cardiovascular disease mortality was analyzed among men and women in relation to ALGOLD and ALLLN, adjusted for age and smoking.
   Results: Among men, all-cause mortality risks were similar by airflow limitation criteria: AL(GOLD) RR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.26-1.38; AL(LLN), RR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.31-1.44. The risk estimates were also similar by airflow limitation definition for cardiovascular mortality and for COPD mortality. Among women, all-cause mortality was also similar by airflow limitation criteria, but significantly higher as compared to men: AL(GOLD) RR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.66-2.66; AL(LLN), RR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.66-2.62. Also cardiovascular and COPD mortality by airflow limitation criteria was significantly higher among women as compared to men.
   Conclusions: Defined either as FEV1/VC < 0.7 or as FEV1/VC < LLN, airflow limitation predicted excess mortality risk of similar magnitude. Mortality in relation to airflow limitation was higher among women compared to men.

AB Objective: Community pharmacists can make significant contributions and be an indispensable member in the asthma therapy chain. The present study aimed to investigate the current knowledge level of Vietnamese community pharmacists in asthma counselling and the impact of a short training program on asthma knowledge and practice.
   Method: 300 community pharmacists participated in the study. A knowledge questionnaire about asthma medications and a standardized inhaler checklist were designed to evaluate their knowledge before and after a 4h training program. Six to eight weeks later, 10 simulated patients were sent to the community pharmacies to evaluate the pharmacists' knowledge and practice.
   Results: The training program significantly improved the asthma knowledge score of pharmacists from 5.3 to 17.2 out of a maximum score of 20 (p < 0.001). After the training, the percentage of pharmacists performing correctly inhaler devices increased significantly (0% vs. similar to 50%, p < 0.001). In the simulated patient study, pharmacists who attended the training demonstrated better asthma knowledge with higher scores (5.4 vs 1.7 out of a maximum score of 7.0, p < 0.001), as well as much better inhaler technique scores (6.1 vs 4.3, out of a maximum score of 8, p < 0.001). These pharmacists achieved higher scores in all aspects encompassing distinguishing controllers and relievers, counselling correctly about adherence, and common side effects.
   Conclusion: Our results revealed significant knowledge deficiency about asthma among Vietnamese community pharmacists. However, a short training program was effective in upskilling the pharmacists to effectively counsel asthmatic patients about the management of their condition and medications.

AB The INHALATOR study was a randomized, multicentre, open label, two-period of 7 days each, crossover study, with 7 days of washout in-between, aiming to evaluate the correct use, satisfaction and preference between Breezhaler (R) and Respimat (R) devices in patients under daily use of open Spiriva (R) or open Onbrize (R), as monotherapy for treatment of mild or moderate COPD. Patients aged >= 40 years with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-year were included in the study. Primary endpoint was the rate of correct use of each device at the first day of treatment after reading the drug leaflet information and was evaluated under the supervision of a trained evaluator. At the end of each treatment phase, the inhaler use was re-evaluated and a satisfaction questionnaire was completed. The patients' preference for the inhaler devices was assessed at the end of the study. After exclusions due to screening failures, 140 patients were randomized: 136 received at least one dose of Breezhaler (R) and 135 of Respimat (R). At treatment start, the rate of correct inhaler use was 40.4% (95% CI: 32.2%-48.7%) for Breezhaler (R) and 36.3% (95% CI: 28.2%-44.4%) for Respimat (R) (p = 0.451). After 7 days, the rates were 68.9% (95% CI: 61.1%-76.7%) and 60.4% (95% CI: 52.2%-68.7%), respectively (p = 0.077). According to the Feeling of Satisfaction with Inhaler Questionnaire - FSI 10 patients were more satisfied using Breezhaler (R) than Respimat (R) and 57.1% preferred using Breezhaler (R) (p= 0.001) while 30.1% preferred Respimat (R) (p < 0.001).

AB Background: Although reduced lung function is associated with both COPD and coronary events (CE), the pattern of lung function impairment could be different for the two outcomes. We examined different measures of lung function in relation to incident COPD events and CE in a population-based cohort.
   Methods: Baseline spirometry and lung clearance index (LCI) were assessed in 672 men aged 55 years. Outcomes included incident COPD events and CE (hospitalisation or mortality). Cox regression was used to obtain HRs per 1-standard deviation (SD) decrement in baseline lung function. The Lunn-McNeil competing risks approach was used to assess if differences in risks for incident COPD events and CE were significant.
   Results: Over 44 years follow-up there were 85 incident COPD events and 266 incident CE. Low FEV1 and FEV1/VC and high LCI showed significantly stronger relationships with COPD events than CE (adjusted HRs per 1SD decrement and p-value for equal associations: FEV1; HRCOPD: 2.11 (1.66-2.68), HRCE: 1.30 (1.13-1.49) p < 0.001, FEV1/VC; HRCOPD 1.95 (1.60-2.36), HRCE 1.11 (0.98-1.26) p < 0.0001, LCI; HRCOPD: 1.58 (1.26-1.98), HRCE: 1.14 (1.00-1.31) p = 0.015. Low VC was significantly associated with both COPD and CE, but HRs were not significantly different between the outcomes (p-value for equal associations = 0.706).
   Conclusions: Low FEV1 and FEV1/VC and high LCI at baseline show significantly stronger relationships with future COPD events than CE. Low VC at baseline is similarly associated with future COPD events and CE. This indicates differences but also an important similarity in the "lung function profile" for developing incident COPD events or incident CE later in life.

TI Improvement of thermal stability of InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well by
   reducing the density of threading dislocations
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS
LA English
DT Article
ID DEFECTS
AB Three InGaN/GaN multi-quantum well (MQW) samples are grown on c-plane sapphire substrate and free standing GaN substrate, respectively. The emission and structural sproperties of these samples are studied in detail. It is found that the thermal stability and emission homogeneity of InGaN/GaN MQWs grown on GaN substrate is much better than that grown on sapphire substrate. This may be attributed to the lower density of threading dislocations in InGaN/GaN MQW regions grown on GaN substrate. Threading dislocations often end with V-pits at InGaN surface, and often contain In-rich clusters around them. These In-rich regions are easy to segregate during high temperature p-type layer growth, leading to the degradation of InGaN/GaN MQWs ultimately.

AB The dynamic modulation of effective electro-optic (EO) coefficient in pulsed laser deposited SBN thin film was investigated using Senarmont Compensation method. Prism coupling technique was used to realize a waveguide to guide the light in SBN thin film. The dynamic variation of effective electro-optic coefficient over a wide frequency range (10 Hz-20 MHz) was investigated with the maximum value of 198 pm/V. This wide frequency bandwidth obtained in the present article opens up avenues to design an EO modulator using ferroelectric SBN thin film. A lower value of half wave voltage (38 V) along with high figure of merit (0.9 x 10(6) V-2) were obtained for the fabricated SBN60 thin film based EO modulator.

AB Eu-doped calcium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics have been successfully prepared from the initial calcium aluminosilicate glass, containing 50 wt% of silica, under heat-treatment. Structural and optical properties of glass and obtained glass-ceramics were investigated. Control of crystallization using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy allowed to identify two main crystalline phases: anorthite [CaAl2Si2O8] as the major phase and melilite [Ca2Mg0.75Al0.5Si1.75O7] as the minor phase. Luminescent properties were investigated by emission spectra, lifetime measurements and color point analysis. The Eu3+ ion emission was used as an environment probe in the initial glass and glass-ceramics. Additionally, the broad band emission due to 4f(6)5d(1)-> 4f(7) showed that Eu2+ is incorporated into the crystalline phases after reduction of Eu3+ during annealing. This incorporation, increasing with time of heat-treatment, enhanced Eu2+ luminescence.

AB The two photon absorption (TPA) coefficient (beta), the nonlinear refractive index (n(2)), and the third order nonlinear optical susceptibility (x (< 3 >)) of tellurium dioxide glasses were investigated using the absorption spectra, normalized transmission, and Z-scan methods. We studied the influence of different transition metals, with and without the rare earth ion Er3+, on the nonlinear properties of these glasses. The experimental results show that (n(2)) and (beta) are the highest for the glass consisting of cadmium oxide doped with rare earth ions. Consequently, the real and imaginary part of the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (x (< 3 >)) is the highest for these materials. Moreover, the presence of Er3+ increased the NLO coefficients the all the examined samples. The Z-scan result confirms, the glasses exhibit self-focusing effects and the sign of the refractive nonlinearity is positive.

AB In this work, we synthesized highly uniform and well-dispersed hexagonal phase GdPO4 nanorods by hydro thermal method at 180 degrees C, which were transformed to GdPO4 nanocrystals with the monoclinic phase upon heating above 800 degrees C. The phase transformation process and photoluminescence properties of as-prepared samples were investigated via XRD, FE-SEM, and PL spectroscopy. The integrated emission intensity of GdPO4:0.07 Tb3+ (monoclinic) is almost 2.62 times stronger than that of GdPO4 center dot H2O:0.07 Tb3+ (hexagonal). By codoping the Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions into the GdPO4 host, the emitting colors could be adjusted from the green to warm white due to the efficient energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ at 368 nm excitation. Moreover, the energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ was revealed to be resonant type by quadrupole-quadrupole mechanism, and the energy transfer efficiency of GdPO4:Tb3+, y Eu3+ reached about 96.1% when the concentration unit of Eu3+ was 12 mol%. These merits demonstrate that this material may find potential application in warm-white display fields.

AB The aim of this study is to prepare novel pyrazole-based oligoamide (oligo-pyrazole) film and to investigate its optical properties. The oligo-pyrazole was obtained by reacting pyrazole-3,4-dicarbonyl dichloride and 2,3-diaminopyridine in a single step reaction. The synthesized oligo-pyrazole was characterized by H-1, C-13 NMR, FT-IR, Elemental Analysis and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The novel oligo-pyrazole film was prepared using synthesized oligo-pyrazole with 94 pm thickness. The optical properties of the prepared film such as absorbance, transmittance and optical band gap were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy. The E-g value of the oligo-pyrazole film was found to be 1856 eV. The surface morphology of the sample was investigated by an Atomic force microscopy (AFM) tool. It was found that average roughness of the film was 15.55 nm with the homogeneous grain distribution on the surfaces. The oligo-pyrazole film may be a good device in optoelectronic applications due to optical and morphological properties.

AB A tunable and angle-independent thermal emitter which consists of silicon carbide (SiC) gratings incorporated with Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) phase change materials (PCMs) in the mid-infrared (MIR) range has been proposed and investigated. The reflectivity under different conditions is simulated by the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) method. It is shown that a large shift of reflection dip is attainable within the Reststrahlen band of SiC (10.288 mu m-12.563 mu m) for transverse magnetic (TM) polarization light, when GST is changed between the crystalline and amorphous states. The deep reflection dips appeared for the two states of GST are attributed to the excitation of surface phonon plaritions (SPhPs). In addition, the incident angle independence of wavelength for both states of GST is obtained, which is a major feature of the tunable thermal emitter.

AB Considering the biomedical and biocatalytic effectiveness of cinnamon nanoparticles (CNPs), we prepared them in methanol media using green pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) technique. A Q-switched pulsed Nd:YAG laser of wavelength 532 nm was used. These colloidal CNPs were characterized at room temperature using TEM, EDX, UV-Vis absorption, PL emission and FTIR-ATR measurements. The influence of varying laser ablation energy (LAE) on the structure, morphology and optical properties were determined. TEM images manifested the nucleation of highly spherical (mean diameter 19.43 nm), stable and pure CNPs with excellent absorption and emission behavior. EDX spectra divulged the appropriate elemental traces in the CNPs. Absorption spectra of CNPs revealed an intense UV peak centered at 321 nm. FTIR-ATR spectra disclosed the covering of CNPs by plant secondary metabolites and released protein molecule. PL emission spectra of as-synthesized CNPs under 350 nm excitations displayed a prominent peak in the range of 436-431 nm accompanied by a blue shift with increasing LAE. Furthermore, the PL intensity was gradually enhanced with the increase in LAE, demonstrating the formation of large number of luminescent centers by CNPs. Such distinctive features of CNPs were attributed to the synergy between methanol as liquid growth media and fundamental wavelength of laser. It was established that the achieved spherical CNPs in methanol suspension could be beneficial for antioxidant purposes.

AB We report the experimental study of changes in optical properties of oxidised porous silicon induced by pore filling with salts from aqueous solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that pore filling is a simple and effective method for tuning the refractive index of porous silicon, which can be applied locally. This method can be used for creation of waveguides and other planar optical components. Our results correlate with previously reported works on the subject and provide information, which can be useful for the future investigation of porous materials.
   Our samples were thin porous layers on top of Si wafers. We used aqueous solutions of several phosphate salts with various concentrations for filling the pores. After the pore filling, the dry samples were examined using optical spectrometry, microscopy (optical and electron) and EDS methods.
   The paper provides description of the experimental procedures, data analysis and comparison with theoretical calculations.

AB Cerium doped lutetium aluminum garnet single crystal has been drawing great research interest of scientists due to its superior performance in scintillation material for high energy particle detection. However, the problem about slow components in the scintillation response restricts the further improving. Here, we utilize the "band-gap engineering" strategy that the admixture of Ga3+ in Lu3Al5O12 can lower the conduction band edge and bury shallow traps, and get the Ce3+ doped Lu3Ga3Al2O12 scintillation ceramics sintered in the oxygen atmosphere and hot isostatic pressing post-treated. The luminescence and scintillation properties are investigated. A shortened dominant decay time and the presence of some second slower components in the photoluminescence decays prove that the admixture of Ga3+ in Lu3Al5O12 can lower the conduction band edge and consequently also the ionization barrier for Ce3+ emission from 5d(1) level. Meanwhile, the Ce:Lu3Ga3Al2O12 ceramic sample shows good steady-state scintillation efficiency under the X-ray excitation. Furthermore, it performs excellent in terms of the fast-to-slow emission ratio in scintillation response with a LY0.5 mu s/LV6 mu s values ratio up to 92%.

The third order nonlinear refractive index and nonlinear absorption coefficient of the grown crystal were measured by Z-scan studies. The third order nonlinear susceptibility was found to be 1.8792 x 10(-4) esu which is fairly higher than the other compounds. The Photoluminescence spectra reveal the emission bands for LPLPB crystals. The Photoconductivity studies were employed to determine the dependence of photocurrent on the applied electric field. Negative photoconductivity was exhibited by the sample. The d. c. conductivity of the grown crystal was measured by the complex impedance analysis wherein the obtained plot in the form of semicircle finds application in Debye relaxation for materials having large dc conductivity.

AB In this manuscript, we report the design, manufacturing and characterization of silicon oxynitride (SiON) based optical waveguide ring resonators (OWRR) which achieve higher quality factors with respect to the state-of-the-art waveguide ring resonators. To improve the coupling efficiency, Bragg grating couplers are used at both ends of the designed resonators instead of the conventional directional couplers. In the proposed design, the core of OWRR structure was realized in the optimized refractive silicon oxynitride films deposited by liquid source chemical vapor deposition (LSCVD), under controllable composition ratio, time slot duration, and deposition temperature. The SiON based resonators have achieved a measured waveguide loss of 4.07 dB/cm and a quality factor of 0.93 x 10(5) in the transverse electric (TE) mode, and this by the way outperforms the results fulfilled with the state-of-the-art waveguide ring resonators.

AB A first demonstration and complete characterization of mid-infrared waveguides in single crystal diamond are reported. Waveguides were designed for 2.4 pm and 8.6 mu m waveguiding, with their group velocity dispersion analyzed using femtosecond pulses at 2.4 mu m wavelength propagated through the waveguide and the bulk substrate. The total dispersion was found to be dominated by the bulk material rather than the waveguide, and was on the range of 275 fs(2)/mm, demonstrating that femtosecond laser written modifications in diamond introduce negligible perturbations to the pristine material.

AB Novel organic-inorganic mesoporous luminescent polymeric composite materials containing lanthanide (Eu3+, Tb3+) complexes covalently bonded to mesoporous silica have been prepared in situ, followed by the polymerization reaction of the monomer 4-vinylphenylboronic acid (VPBA) extending along the mesoporous SBA-15 channels. The obtained materials were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Ultraviolet absorption spectra (UV), X-ray diffraction (SAXRD), N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetry (TG), and luminescence spectroscopy in detail. These characterizations have proved that composite materials possess high surface area, uniform mesoporous structure, good crystallization and relatively excellent luminescence properties. The terminal ligand phen was used to investigate the difference of photo physical and luminescent properties between binary and ternary composite materials. Furthermore, the results have revealed that the composite material Eu(PVPBA-S15)(3)phen showed more efficient intramolecular energy transfer between the europium ion and the ligands, and more excellent characteristic emission of the europium ion under UV irradiation with higher D-5(0) luminescence quantum efficiency than the composite materials Eu(PVPBA-S15)(3) without phen. The excellent luminescence properties and ordered mesoporous structures could give rise to many potential applications in optical and electronic areas.

AB The paper focuses on the first attempt at investigating the effect of high-temperature modification with SiO2 nanoparticles on the diffuse reflectance spectra within 0.2-2.2 mu m and on the particle-size distribution of barium sulphate powders. It has been found that there exists the correlation between changes in diffuse reflectance spectra and particle size distribution during heating and modifying BaSO4 micropowders with SiO2 nano particles. By high-temperature heating (800 degrees C) of BaSO4 micropowder and by deposition of SiO2 nanoparticles (C = 1 wt%), one can increase the reflectance capacity of BaSO4 powder. Additionally, it is shown that SiO2 nanoparticles deposited onto the surface block the formation of BaSO4 micropowder granules.

AB The impact of thermal annealing on the properties of LuAG:Ce and LuAG:Pr ceramics has been investigated. The results of measurements of pulse height spectra, scintillation time profiles, absorption spectra, radioluminescence as a function of temperature, absorption spectra, as well as low temperature thermally stimulated luminescence, performed before and after annealing of the samples in air, are compared. Pulse height spectra are used to estimate the light outputs of the samples, while scintillation time profiles to find the decay time constants. Absorption spectra are analyzed to identify the observed lines and/or bands. Radioluminescence spectra examine the changes of particular emissions as a function of temperature. Finally, parameters of traps detected in thermally stimulated luminescence are determined by decompositions of the recorded glow curves.

AB Luminescence properties of the Er-doped and Er-Ag co-doped glasses with Li2B4O7 (Li2O-2B(2)O(3)) basic composition are investigated and analysed. The Li2B4O7 glasses of high chemical purity and optical quality, doped with Er and co-doped with Er and Ag were obtained in the air using standard glass technology. Spectroscopic properties of the Li2B4O7:Er and Li2B4O7:Er,Ag glasses were studied using optical absorption and photoluminescence (excitation, emission, decay kinetics) experimental techniques as well as Judd-Ofelt analysis. The theoretical and experimental oscillator strengths for observed absorption transitions as well as Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters (Omega(2), Omega(4), Omega(6)) have been calculated. Photoluminescence spectra of the Li2B4O7 :Er and Li2B4O7:Er,Ag glasses reveal intense infrared (I-4(13/2 )-> I-4(1)5/2 transition, lambda(max) = 1530 nm) and green (S-4(3/)2 -> I-4(15/2) transition, lambda(max) = 546 nm) emission bands. Radiative properties such as transition probabilities (A(rad)), luminescence branching ratios (beta), stimulated emission cross-sections (sigma(em)), and radiative lifetimes (tau(rad)) are estimated. Experimental and radiative lifetimes were compared and quantum efficiency (eta) has been evaluated. Considerable enhancement of the Er3+ green luminescence in the Li2B4O7 :Er,Ag glasses has been observed. The observed enhancement is attributed to energy transfer from Ag+ to Er3+ ions as well as local field effects induced by surface plasmon resonance of the silver metallic nanoparticles.

AB The complex dielectric function, the Er3+ Stokes emission at approximate to 1540 nm and the upconversion photoluminescence at approximate to 990 nm of pulsed-laser deposited thin-film GeGaSbS:Er3+ are studied. The linear-refractiveindex dispersion is obtained by fitting spectroscopic ellipsometry data to the Sellmeier and the Cody-Lorentz parametrizations. The former model is used to calculate nonlinear refractive index. The Stokes emission intensity at approximate to 1540 nm, originating from the Er3+: I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/2) transition under a 980 nm pumping, diminishes with increasing refractive index and decreasing optical-bandgap energy of the films. An attempt to relate differences in the optical and photoluminescence properties to the atomic structure elucidated from Raman spectra analysis is presented. The emission probability is highest for the structure with the lowest fraction of (semi)metallic bonds, the highest content of homonuclear S-S bonds and the lowest Ge/S ratio. In such a film, the clustering of Er3+ ions, which is responsible for the intensity weakening, is suppressed. The film shows approximate to 990nm upconversion photoluminescence originating from the Er3+: I-4(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) transition under a 1550 nm excitation. The upconversion peak shape resembles that of the compositionally and structurally similar bulk glass.

AB In this paper, Co doped TiO2 powders were prepared through solid-state reaction. The effects of sintering temperature on microstructures, morphologies, variable color and emissivity properties of the Co doped TiO2 powders were investigated in detail. The results show that Co2+ ions substitute for Ti4+ ions effectively in rutile TiO2 after heat-treating at 900 degrees C-1200 degrees C. Increasing sintering temperature from 900 degrees C to 1200 degrees C improves crystalline quality, substitution amount of Co2+ for Ti4+ and oxygen concentration of the Co doped TiO2 powders. All the Co doped TiO2 powders show reversible thermochromism, which are green at room temperature and yellow at testing temperature of similar to 800 degrees C. Simultaneously, the maximum variation of infrared emissivity reaches to 0.332 with testing temperature changing from room temperature to 800 degrees C in the powders sintered at 1100 degrees C. The Co doped TiO2 powders are competitive materials for smart stealth compatible visible light and infrared wavebands.

AB Luminescence thermometry on europium doped TiO2 films, prepared by the plasma electrolytic oxidation, was investigated by the Luminescence Intensity Ratio method. The performance of the material for temperature sensing was tested from room temperature to 260 degrees C. The theoretical fit of the emission intensity ratio of Eu3+ D-5(1) -> F-7(1) and D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transitions revealed the energy difference between D-5(1) and D-5(0) levels of 1777 cm(-1). Temperature sensitivity was calculated on the entire temperature range, with maximum value of 3.43 %K-1 at 293 K. The relationship between Judd-Ofelt and thermometric parameters was demonstrated, and further utilized for the calculation of the radiative transition probability, dipole strength and radiative lifetime of the D-5(1) -> F-7(1) transition.

AB Herein, we report a facile, low-cost and one-step hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of MnCo2O4 (MCO) nanoparticles without any post annealing treatment. The crystalline phase, the morphology, and the valences of the elements in the obtained samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and Energy dispersive spectra (EDS) analysis, respectively. XRD and TEM results suggest that as synthesized MnCo2O4 have spinel cubic structure with spherical shaped morphology. The Nitrogen adsorption desorption analysis indicates that the BET surface area is calculated to be 65.3 m(2)/g and the pore size distribution is mostly centered at 28 nm, which is in good agreement with the grain size calculated from XRD results. Gas sensing properties of nanocrystalline MnCo2O4 clad modified fiber optic sensor is reported for ethanol and acetone gasses, at room temperature. The results showed that MnCo2O4 has high sensitivity to ethanol gas, fast response and recovery time than compared to acetone gas. The possible gas sensing mechanism is also proposed in detail.

AB This work aims at demonstrating the fabrication of a new composite material based on the micron-sized powder of the alexandrite mineral (BeAl2O4:Cr3+) dispersed in a fluorinated polymer for OSL dosimetric applications. Composites with 50 wt% alexandrite powders were obtained and characterized in their chemical composition, mechanical, and luminescent properties. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping measurements of the pellets revealed a homogeneous distribution of alexandrite particles throughout the organic matrix. PL measurements showed the signal related to Cr3+ ions in alexandrite remained active besides all fabrication steps, and tensile tests showed the pellets to have good ductility and tensile strength. The OSL results showed the integrated intensity signal varied linearly with the beta irradiation dose and that the pellets were stable at room temperature over time of 28 days. Nevertheless, improvements in the fabrication process are necessary toward obtaining the same OSL intensity from different pellets.

AB Hybrid organic-inorganic double-layered structures are fabricated from Zinc Phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs). The inclusion of GaAs interlayer widens the absorption spectrum of ZnPc. Photoluminescence (PL) shows that GaAs quenches emission from the ZnPc suggesting carriers transfer to GaAs. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy shows the molecular orientation of ZnPc tunes fast charge transport. The ZnPc/GaAs/ZnPc hybrid structure possess the ability to a wide range of absorption as evident in ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) absorption studies and charge carrier extraction from PL analysis are suitable for solar cell application.

ID DISSOCIATION
AB Dynamic optical behavior of CeO2 thin film has been investigated using Terahertz spectroscopy at room temperature by exciting with different amplitude pulses. The CeO2 thin films have been deposited on Si (100) substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. It has been observed that the optical density increases at 0.75 THz on the incident of pulse >= 100 kV/cm indicating that it is possible to induce extremely large amplitude motions in the harmonic potential of the material by direct excitation of CeO2 vibrations with intense THz pulse. This study further shows that it is possible to control the large amplitude motions in the materials using different high power THz pulses, and in turn can control the optical properties, establishing the nonlinear spectroscopy technique for such studies.

AB We demonstrated a homeotropic liquid crystal (LC) alignment state on fluorinated self-assembled monolayers (FSAMs) deposited by gas-phase method as a function of deposition time. The gas-phase method to deposit FSAMs was simple process and cost-effective. Contact angle data and surface energy analyses of the FSAMs showed that film formation occurs, and showed a correlation with the homeotropic alignment of LC molecules on the FSAMs. Stable LC alignments on FSAMs were achieved at deposition time over 60 min. In addition, high transparency and thermal stability of FSAM further enhanced its possibility as a LC alignment layer.

AB Two novel conjugated pyrene derivatives (C1 and C2) with D-pi-A structures were synthesized to realize broadband reverse saturable absorption (RSA) under femtosecond laser excitation (ranging from 515 to 700 nm) resulting from two-photon absorption (WA) and WA-induced excited-state absorption. Furthermore, these two derivatives showed RSA on the picosecond and nanosecond time regions (532 nm). Quantum chemical calculations indicated that two mechanisms for the HOMO-LUMO excitation of the two molecules exist simultaneously: intramolecular charge transfer (which is considered to trigger the nonlinear optical response) and pi-pi* transition. It was found that the pi-pi* transition localized in the pyrene group can contribute to the increase in the nonlinear absorption of pyrene derivatives. Femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectrum provided information on the dynamics of the locally excited singlet state ((LE)-L-1) and the charge-transfer state ((CT)-C-1) for both compounds. The results show that these pyrene derivatives are promising candidates for future optoelectronic and RSA applications.

AB Un-doped and Eu3+ doped Sr2SiO4 nanophosphors were synthesized by self-propagating solution combustion synthesis and are characterised with different material and optical characterisations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed orthorhombic phase, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the nanophosphors with irregular shape but crystalline in nature. The photoluminescence (PL) excitation, emission spectra and lifetime are thoroughly discussed. The emission spectra due to the excitation under 393 nm showed better asymmetric ratios than the 260 nm excitation ensuring better color purity of 97%. The comparative investigations using commission international del'Eclirage (CIE) diagram also established that the color purity of 393 nm excitation is superior with CIE co-ordinates (0.66, 0.34) and is close to NTSC standards. The Judd Ofelt (JO) intensity parameters (Omega(2) and Omega(4)) were obtained from PL emission spectrum and the JO parameters followed the trend Omega(2) > Omega(4) for all Eu3+ concentration. Asymmetric ratios and JO analysis both indicated that the crystal field is non-centrosymmetric in nature. The radiative properties such as branching ratios, emission cross section, optical gain and gain bandwidth of optimised concentration are calculated. Photoluminescence lifetimes exhibited biexponential nature and showed higher lifetime for 393 nm excitation. Furthermore, the quenching due to non radiative energy transfer mechanism is dominated by multipole-multipole interaction. All these optical characterisations supported the fact that the nanophosphors excited at 393 nm have better pertinence towards display, laser and lighting application. Thermoluminescence (TL) studies of the nanophosphors were carried out. The kinetic parameters are calculated using general order kinetics and are verified by computerised glow curve de-convolution (CGCD). TL emission spectra and contour plots were analysed that further confirmed that the emission resembled the same as PL emission spectra.

Both glasses were prepared by melt and quenching technique. The FTIR spectra show weaker vibration of OH group in Dy3+ doped oxyfluoride glass than oxide glass due to fluoride existence. It results to stronger 4f-4f transition of oxyfluoride than oxide glass. The highest absorption band centered at 1269 nm of both glasses corresponds to E-6(15/2) -> F-6(11/2) transition of Dy3+. The prepared glasses were excited by photon with 388 nm and emitted white light due to the integration of strong yellow 575 nm (F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2)) and blue 482 nm (F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2)) emission. X-ray luminescence also were affeted from less vibration of OH group in oxyfluoride glass and showed similar strong emission pattern to the photoluminescence spectra. The calculations of radiative properties were done by Judd-Ofelt theory. The oxyfluoride glass showed more asymmetry of Dy3+ environment with higher J-O parameter (Omega(2)) value than oxide glass. The radiative transition probability (A(R)), stimulated emission cross-sections (sigma) and branching ratios (beta(R)) of oxyfluoride glass were higher than oxide glass which perform lower laser threshold and higher gain laser application. Both glasses in this work performed the high potential for photonic applications, but addition of fluoride made barium zinc oxyfluoride borotellurite glass more suitable than barium zinc oxide borotellurite glass for usage as a scintillation, laser medium and other white-light photonic material.

AB In this paper, we show that the optical properties such as extinction coefficient, refractive index, optical conductivity and optical energy band gap of aminoazobenzene and pseudostilbene-type azobenzene polymers can be effectively manipulated by changing or adding various substituents in their polymeric system.
   We found that the absorption spectrum of aminoazobenzene polymer thin film is shifted to blue compared to pseudostilbene-type azobenzene polymer thin films. Therefore, the optical energy band gap for aminoazobenzene polymer thin film is higher than for pseudostilbene-type azobenzene polymers. We also noticed that the studied azo dyes polymer thin films exhibit high photoresponse proper for use in the optoelectronic applications.

AB Co(II), Cu(II) and UO2(II)-complexes of 2-Benzylidene-1-(5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)hydrazine (HBDHT) have been synthesized and well characterized by elemental analyses, molar conductance, electronic and FT-IR, SEM and XRD techniques. Spectral data confirmed the molecular structure of the proposed complexes. Structural parameters of the present compounds were obtained using a density function (DFT) molecular orbital calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level implemented by the Gaussian 09 program. All the synthesized compounds may attend as potential photoactive provisions as indicated from their distinctive fluorescence. Moreover, the fluorescence studies showed that the order of emission wavelengths and Stokes shifts are HBDHT-complex > Co(II)-complex > UO2(II)-complex. Investigation of the absorption coefficient close to the absorption edge implies that the type of band gap is direct allowed and has a value of 3.75 eV. The heterojunction of Cu-BDHT films/p-Si showed remarkable rectifying behavior in dark as well as demonstrated distinguished photovoltaic characteristics under illumination of 100 mW/cm(2). Furthermore, the time-dependent photocurrent investigation demonstrated an acceptable response time to the influence of light. This responsivity characteristic specifies a recommendation for the prepared heterojunction for opening another point of view in photodetector applications.

AB Effects of irradiation on structure peculiarities and viscoelastic properties of the polyurethanes, synthesized by a polycondensation method with a use of different diisocyanate and glycol components have been investigated. Photooxydation processes are shown to change elasticity of the materials, glass transition temperature and average molecular mass for the chain segments between polymer cross-linked points, and also induce accumulation of hydroxyls in the system due to the formation of alcohol and hydroperoxide groups. Beam strength of the polyurethanes is found out to be dependent on the polymer chemical structure, in particular, on a length of the aliphatic block and density of the cross-linking network. Good agreement between the results obtained by the dynamic mechanical analysis, IR-spectroscopy, EPR methods and the data for the single-pulse laser destruction thresholds allows to predict photooxidation susceptibility for the further developed polyurethane materials.

AB Relationships between molecular structures of aromatic- and aliphatic-substituted diphosphine dioxide ligands and properties of Eu(III) complexes were investigated. Substitution of CF3 groups in phenyl groups of diphosphine dioxide ligands has an outstanding effect in terms of both reducing the sum of the enthalpy of fusion and phase transition (Delta H-sum) and enlarging solubility. Large photoluminescence intensity and solubility were realized when the number of methylene units between two P=O groups of diphosphine dioxide ligands (n) was 3.
   Eu(III) complex 6 with the diphosphine dioxide ligand that satisfies both conditions (substitution of CF3 groups and n = 3) is highly soluble in a fluorinated solvent and has relatively large photoluminescence intensity. It is a promising candidate for LED devices, security media and sensing applications.

AB We have obtained the mixed crystals ammonium nickel-copper sulfate hexahydrate compounds which exhibits 98% transmittance in the ultraviolet region, a promising material for UV light filters and UV sensors for solar-blind technology. These crystals belong to the family of Tutton's salt having empirical formula (NH4)(2)NixCu(1-x) (SO4)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and they were synthesized by employing growth from the slow evaporation of aqueous solution technique. The crystallographic parameters, three-dimensional Hirshfeld surface analysis and the calculation of two-dimensional fingerprint plots of the sample crystal (NH4)(2)Cu(SO4)(2)center dot 6H(2)O were determined with the help of single crystal X-Ray diffraction. The X-ray powder diffraction of the pulverized samples were carried out at ambient temperature, 200 degrees C and 350 degrees C with the purpose to observe the change in the crystalline structure when subjected to higher temperatures. The thermal analysis of the samples was conducted in the temperature range 30-900 degrees C with the help of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which provides the information about the thermal stability and decomposition process during the heat treatment. Some of our sample crystals demonstrated high dehydration temperature up to 108 degrees C and they can be considered as an excellent candidate for UV light filters for high temperature applications. The direct and indirect band gaps of the samples were determined from UV-Vis spectra with the help of Tauc's equation. The overtones and combinations of fundamental vibrations of the functional groups our sample crystals were investigated by utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy in the wavelength range 830-2500 nm.

AB The photoluminescence properties of NaTaOGeO4:Mn2+, Pr3+ are investigated in this paper. Their luminescent properties were characterized by means of diffuse reflection, photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra, lifetime and temperature-dependent emission spectra in the temperature range of 295-495 K. The phosphors NaTaOGeO4:Mn2+ show a strong broad absorption band centered at about 248 nm. The emission spectrum of NaTaOGeO4:Mn2+ shows orange-red emissions at 576 nm, owing to the T-4(1) -> (6)A(1) transition of Mn2+. With the introduction of Pr3+ ions into NaTaOGeO4:Mn2+, the emission spectra exhibit both the T-4(1) -> (6)A(3) transition of Mn2+ and the P-3(0 ->) H-3(4) transition of Pr3+ with the excited wavelength at 248 nm. The emission color of NaTaOGeO4:Mn2+, Pr3+ can be tuned by adjusting the relative concentration of Mn2+ and Pr3+ in a single component. The energy transfers from Mn2+ to Pr3+.

AB A proximity coupled wideband graphene patch antenna is proposed for THz applications. Antenna resonates with the closely placed higher order TM1 delta modes (4 <= delta <= 12 or more). The generation of the large number of modes with resonant frequencies close to each other provides the wideband response. The wideband graphene antenna is modeled to obtain the optimum values of physical parameters. The antenna parameters are defined for the impedance matching and tuning of the frequency response. Varying the physical parameters, the antenna response can also be tuned to obtain the multiband response. The proposed antenna enables to achieve 109.25% impedance bandwidth.

AB The Sr1.99-xBi0.01CeO4:xRE(3+) (RE3+ = Dy3+, Sm3+ and Eu3+, x = 0 and 0.03) single, co-doped and tri-doped phosphors synthesized by solid state reaction technique and their structure analysed by X-ray powder diffraction technique (XRD). The results shows that the Dy3+,Sm3+, Eu3+, Dy3+/Sm3+, Sm3+/Eu3+, Dy3+/Eu3+, and Dy3+/Sm3+/Eu3+ ions are effectively studded into the host lattice site without changing the structure of the host. The luminescence and energy transfer properties of the Sr1.99-xBi0.01CeO4:xRE(3+) have been investigated for single, co-doped and tri-doped phosphors under each of the 387 nm (Dy3+: H-6(15/2)-> I-4(13)/2), 409 nm (Sm3+: H-6(5/)2 -> P-6(3/2)) and 466 nm (Eu3+: F-7(0)-> L-S(6)) excitation levels wherein the mean emission values reportedly seem to be 572, 651 and 615 nm respectively. The chromaticity coordinates and decay time of the synthesized materials are also examined.

AB In this paper, hybrid Silicon-Barium Titanate (Si-BTO) based Two Dimensional Photonic Crystal (2DPC) platform is proposed for electric field sensing based on the effective refractive index modulation of electro-optic material. The nano-sensing platform is composed of the PC based resonator and inline quasi-waveguides in a 2D triangular lattice with circular rods that are arranged in the air medium. The BTO based nano-cavity resonator is playing a very important role in sensing the different electric field over a wide wavelength range. The operating wavelength range of the proposed sensor is investigated via Photonic Band Gap (PBG) which is obtained by the Plane Wave Expansion (PWE) method. The transmission efficiency, quality factor, electric field sensitivity and change in refractive index are analyzed by using Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD). The simulation results reveal that the resonant wavelength of the electric field sensor is linearly shifted to the higher wavelength region while increasing the electric field from 0 kV/mm to 25 kV/mm. The proposed sensing platform provides high transmission efficiency and very high refractive index sensitivity with an ultra-compact size. Hence, it is highly suitable for nano-chip based sensing applications.

AB In this work, nonlinear optical properties of bisdemethoxycurcumin solution were studied using diffraction ring patterns method. Multiple diffraction rings observed as a continuous wave (CW) laser beam passes through a bisdemethoxycurcumin solution. The nonlinear refractive index, n(2), and change in refractive index, An, for sample were determined from the number of observed rings, and are found to be 0.8327 x 10(-6) cm(2)/W and 0.00946 respectively. The evolution of the diffraction ring patterns are numerically studied using the Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction integral theory. The experimental findings are in good agreement with theoretical analysis. Also the optical limiting properties of the sample were measured at 473 nm. The obtained results proved that the sample bear good optical limiting property.

AB In this work, different concentrations of lithium iodide (LiI) have been added to the gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) containing PEO and PVA in equal ratio, tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and iodine crystals (I-2). The effect of introducing lithium iodide (LiI) into PEO-PVA blended GPE system having TBAI has been investigated in terms of optical, electrical, thermal and electrochemical characteristics. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been carried out to study the interaction of LiI with the GPEs. The GPE without LiI showed the highest conductivity of 5.50 mS cm(-1) at room temperature. With the incorporation of LiI, decrement in conductivity was observed. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with configuration FTO/TiO2/N3-dye/GPE/Pt/FTO have been fabricated and tested under white light of intensity 100 mW cm(-2). The DSSC made of GPE with 1.34 wt% LiI exhibited highest efficiency, eta of 6.26%.

AB The present research aims to suggest a three-step guideline towards selecting a proper Nanofluid regarding the heat transfer effectiveness. To do so, employing two-step technique, the nanofluid's samples were prepared in various nanoparticles' concentrations (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1%) of MWCNT-ZnO hybrid nanoparticle in a thermal oil. The samples' stability has been examined employing the Zeta potential analysis. The samples' thermal conductivity has been experimentally measured at various temperatures (15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 degrees C) and solid concentrations. After that, a three-step guideline to select a proper nanofluid as a heat transfer fluid has been proposed. Then, for both the internal laminar and turbulent regimes, variations of pumping power due to adding hybrid nanoparticle has been theoretically studied. Furthermore, the possible effects of adding nano particles on the convective heat transfer coefficient in a microchannel heat sink have been investigated. The results declared that the convective heat transfer coefficient had been enhanced by 42%. It is concluded that the produced nanofluid, as coolant fluid, would bring a certain benefit in heat transfer applications. These pre-assessment process would ease the decision-making process in selecting a new coolant which possesses superior heat transfer properties in comparison to the conventional coolants (Le., water and oil).

AB In this work, a novel solar thermoelectric generator (TEG) design is proposed to enhance its output power and conversion efficiency. It combines segmented thermoelectric materials and asymmetrical legs with variable cross-sectional area along the leg length. A three-dimensional multiphysics thermoelectric model is employed to examine the performance of the new design. The optimal leg length ratio of two segmented materials (P1 and P2 materials) and the optimal cross-sectional area ratio of cold end to hot end are determined. In comparison with using P1 and P2 materials, the results show that the segmented design increases the output power by 14.9% and 16.6%, respectively, when the leg length ratio is optimized. When the asymmetrical legs are introduced to the segmented design, the output power can be additionally increased by 4.21%, as compared with the optimal segmented design. Moreover, a simple analytical model is proposed to predict the optimal leg length ratio of two thermoelectric materials for the present new design. The proposed model can be reduced to the existing models when the leg cross-sectional area ratio of cold end to hot end is equal to 1. Thus, the model can be considered as a generalized model, which can evaluate the optimal leg length ratio for the segmented design with any leg shape. Based on the model, the optimal leg length ratio should make the interface temperature between the two materials equal to the temperature of intersection point of their ZT (figure of merit) curves. Theoretically, this conclusion can be extended to any leg shape with a constant or variable cross-sectional area. The present simulations verify the theoretical prediction of the optimal leg length ratio.

AB The present paper describes an experimental characterisation of a biomass powered micro-cogeneration system based on the coupling between a gasifier and an internal combustion engine. The EGO 20 unit is sized to deliver a maximum electrical and thermal power of 20 kW(e) and 40 kW(th) respectively. In order to highlight possible inefficiencies along the biomass-to-energy conversion chain, the global energy balance of the system under real working conditions is derived. Ultimate and proximate analyses of the processed biomass are performed, accompanied by temperature and mass flow rate measurements and gas chromatograph characterization of collected samples of the produced syngas. The greatest inefficiency is found in the gasification section with a value of the cold gas efficiency in the range of 57-60%. The low quality of the syngas (lower heating value equal to 3731 kJ/Nm(3)) affects the engine combustion efficiency, hence its electrical efficiency that does not exceed 22.5%. The global electrical efficiency of the plant is equal to about 13.5%. As a further analysis, waste heat recovery is considered under different conditions by decreasing the temperature of the water flowing in the secondary circuit from 68.35 degrees C to 20.50 degrees C for the use of the provided thermal energy. This determines an increase of the thermal efficiency of the engine from 11.3% to 56.2%, while the global thermal efficiency increases from 6.46% to 33.72%. A feature of the ECO 20 system is the cooling of the syngas delivered to the engine by its same cooling water, for a considerable advantage on volumetric efficiency with respect to other analogous systems, also in the cases the thermal power is not utilised.

AB We investigate solar combined heat and power (S-CHP) systems based on hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collectors for the simultaneous provision of domestic hot water (DHW), space heating (SH) and power to single-family homes. The systems include PVT collectors with a polycarbonate flat-box structure design, a water storage tank, an auxiliary heater and a battery storage subsystem. A methodology is developed for modelling the energetic and economic performance of such PVT-based S-CHP systems, which is used to optimally size and operate systems for covering the energy demands of single-family reference households at three selected locations: Athens (Greece), London (CV and Zaragoza (Spain). The results show that optimised systems are capable of covering similar to 65% of the annual household electricity demands in Athens, London and Zaragoza when employing 14.0, 17.0 and 12.4 m(2) collector array areas respectively, while also covering a significant fraction of the thermal energy demands in Athens (similar to 60%) and Zaragoza (similar to 45%); even in London, almost 30% of the reference household's thermal demand is covered by such a system. A corresponding economic analysis reveals that, despite the suitability of Athens' weather conditions for implementing such solar-energy systems, the payback time (PBT) of the optimised S-CHP system in Athens is 15.6 years in contrast to the 11.6 years predicted for Zaragoza, due to the lower electricity prices in Greece. On the other hand, the high carbon emission factor of the electricity grid in Greece makes these systems particularly promising at this location. Specifically, the investigated systems have the potential to displace 3.87, 1.65 and 1.54 tons of CO2 per year in Athens, London and Zaragoza, when substituting the conventional means for household energy provision (i.e. grid electricity and gas fired boilers). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the optimised systems outperform benchmark equivalent systems comprising conventional sheet-and-tube PVT collectors in all studied cases, by covering similar or slightly (up to 3%) higher fractions of the household electrical and thermal demands with 9-11% lower PBTs, and that PV-only solutions displace 3.56, 1.21, 1.22 tCO(2)/year (up to similar to 20-25% lower) for the same area. Overall, the results suggest that the newly proposed polymeric flat-box PVT collector designs are an improved economic proposition over their conventional equivalents, but that the cost of this technology still remains high relative to PV and that if decarbonisation is a desirable goal, especially in high population-density regions with space restrictions, it is important to consider how to promote this technology.

AB A thermal network model is developed to study the performance of a solar thermal-powered heating, cooling and hot water system comprised of evacuated tube collectors, a latent heat thermal energy storage unit and related heat exchangers, and an absorption chiller/heat pump. The system performance is studied for a residential building in a hot climate zone (Phoenix, Arizona) on two typical solar days representative of a relatively cold day and a relatively hot day. A systematic sizing methodology is presented to minimize the phase change material mass and the output temperature fluctuations. An exergy analysis is also performed to quantify the second law efficiency of the system. Analysis of the energy performance of the system shows that more than 80% annual energy saving can be achieved by using a solar collector area of 10 m(2) coupled with a 29 kWh latent heat thermal energy storage system. The effect of the heat transfer design of the thermal energy storage system, in particular the number of condenser pipes of the input heat pipe and evaporator sections of the output heat pipes embedded within the phase change material, on the thermal and exergetic performance of the system is also investigated. It is shown that increasing the number of pipes decreases the temperature fluctuations and increases the exergy efficiency due to minimized temperature drops. Quantitatively, increasing the number of pipes from 60 to 112, decreases the maximum temperature drops across the latent heat thermal energy storage system from about 30 degrees C to 15 degrees C, and increases the exergy efficiency from about 75% to 90%. This study demonstrates the capability of a solar thermal-powered heating, cooling and hot water system integrated with latent heat thermal energy storage to significantly reduce the auxiliary energy input needed to meet the demands of a residential building located in a hot climate zone.
