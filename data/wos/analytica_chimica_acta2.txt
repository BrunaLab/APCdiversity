AB The development of cost-effective methods for early detection and identification of prognostic markers still remains a significant challenge to improve diagnosis and reduce the mortality of cancer. Herein, on the basis of rolling circle amplification (RCA) coupled with nicking endonuclease-assisted signal amplification (NESA), a simple, sensitive and portable biosensor was developed for the determination of p53 DNA by using the personal glucose meter (PGM) as readout. Initially, biotin-modified hairpin probe (HP) was immobilized onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (MBs). The target DNA hybridized with the loop region of the HP, which triggered target recycling process and produced the complementary sequences for the padlock probes. Next, the liberated complementary sequences hybridized with the padlock probes to form a circular template, inducing the subsequent RCA reaction and replicating a long tandem repeated sequences. Then, numerous DNA-invertase conjugation were tagged on the resulted RCA products on the surface of MBs. The DNA-invertase efficiently catalyzed the hydrolysis of sucrose to generate abundant glucose, leading to an amplified response of glucometer. By virtue of the multiple signal amplification strategy, the proposed biosensor toward p53 DNA could achieve a low detection limit of 0.36 pM with a linear calibration range from 0.5 to 10 pM and exhibited excellent sequence selectivity. In addition, the resulting biosensor was also applied to detect the p53 DNA sequence in spiked human serum samples with satisfactory results, which possessed enormous potential to be applied in clinical diagnostics and biomedical research.

AB In this work, an electrochemical aptasensor with a high signal response was constructed for zearalenone (ZEN) detection. Firstly, the polyethyleneimine (PEI) functionalized molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PEI-MoS2-MWCNTs) nanohybrid was designed and prepared as sensing platform and the bioactive molecule of toluidine blue (Tb) as the signal probe. Then the synthesized platinum/gold core/shell (Pt@Au) nanoparticle was dropped on the modified electrodes to load a large amount of ZEN binding aptamer (ZBA). The variation of the electrochemical signal responses which originated from Tb was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) after ZEN binding to ZBA with high affinity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to characterize the nanomaterial. Upon the optimal conditions, the proposed aptasensor showed excellent detection performances for ZEN with a wide concentration range from 0.5 pg mL(-1) to 50 ng mL(-1 )and the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.17 pg mL(-1). Furthermore, this presented method could be feasible for determining ZEN in the real beer samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed a novel amplification strategy termed Endo IV-assisted feedback amplification (EFA) taking advantages of rolling circular amplification (RCA) and Endo IV-assisted signal amplification (ESA) biosensing platform for detecting of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Two kinds of specially programmed DNA complexes were employed into EFA system, one composed of a split aptamer fragment and a circular template, and the other composed of AP probe and the same circular template. Hence, ATP as a target induced the self-assembly of spilt aptamer fragments and initiated RCA reaction generating a linear DNA, which consists of hybridization elements with Complex II and formation elements of G-quadruplex. More importantly, the addition of endonuclease IV can cut the Complex II into two parts, and one of which can be trimming by phi29 DNA polymerase initiating the new round of RCA reaction producing more RCA products. Thus significantly enhanced fluorescent signal can be measured for ATP as expected, and our proposed strategy exhibits improved performances toward ATP ultrasensitive detection with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.09 nM. Additionally, our developed biosensor demonstrates high selectivity and the superiority of simplicity towards ATP. Above these significant aspects, our proximity binding-induced RCA reaction-based fluorescent assay and Endo IV-fueled feedback signal amplification strategy presents an optimal detection performance towards ATP for potential application in related research and clinical diagnosis.

AB Using the internal chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (Inter-CRET) of luminescent dye and the high-energy intermediate formed in 1,1'-oxalyldiimidazole chemiluminescence (ODI-CL) reaction, we developed for the first time dual-enzyme immunoassays operated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for the simultaneous quantifications of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA) in a sample. Fluorescein formed from the ALP enzyme immunoassay emits green light in ODI-CL reaction, while resorufin formed from the HRP enzyme immunoassay emits red light. Green and red CL lights emitted in a detection cell were measured individually with two photomultiplier tubes with an optical filter capable of sensing green or red emission without interferences. The limits of detection for CA 19-9 (0.09 U/ml) and CEA (0.11 ng/ml) determined using the accurate and reproducible dual-enzyme immunoassays were as low as those calculated using the conventional single-enzyme immunoassays capable of sensing CA 19-9 or CEA in a sample. In conclusion, we confirmed that the highly selective dual enzyme immunoassays can be applied as a new analytical method capable of early diagnosing and monitoring colon and pancreatic cancers with the simultaneous analyses of CA 19-9 and CEA.

AB A portable and user-friendly method using personal glucose meters for on-site quantitative detection of organophosphorus pesticide (OP) was developed. The inhibition of organophosphorus compounds on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) leads to reduced yields of thiocholine formed by the enzymatic hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine chloride. Ferricyanide ([Fe(CN)(6)](3-)), the mediator used in glucose test strips for electron transfer to the electrode, can be rapidly reduced to ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)(6)](4-)) by thiocholine. This reaction enables direct measurement of thiocholine by personal glucose meters in the same way as measuring the glucose in blood, offering an interesting choice to quantify OP. After incubation of AChE for 30 min and enzymatic reaction of 10 min, the yield of thiocholine was measured by a personal glucose meter, achieving detection limit of 5 mu g L-1 for paraoxon. The proposed method was successfully applied to the detection in apples and cucumbers, presenting promising potential for on-site OP detection in food samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the field of biosensing, suitable procedures for efficient probes immobilization are of outmost importance. Here we present different light-based strategies to promote the covalent attachment of thiolated capture probes (oligonucleotides and proteins) on different materials and working formats. One strategy employs epoxylated surfaces and uses the light to accomplish the ring opening by a thiol moiety present in a probe. However, most of this work lies on the use of thiol-ene photocoupling chemistry to covalently attach probes to the supports. And thus, both alkenyl and thiol derivatized surfaces are assayed to immobilize thiol or alkene ended probes, respectively, and their performances are compared. Also, the effect of the number of thiols carried by the probe is analyzed comparing single-point and multi-point attachment. The performance of the analogous tethering, but onto alkynylated surfaces is also carried out, and the sensing response is related to the surfaces hydrophobicity. A newly developed reaction is also discussed where a fluorinated surface undergoes the covalent immobilization of thiolated probes activated by light, creating small hydrophilic areas where the probes are attached, and leaving the rest of the surface highly hydrophobic and repellent against protein unspecific adsorption. These mixed surfaces confine the sample (aqueous) uniquely on the hydrophilic spots lowering the background signal and thus increasing the sensitivity. These probe immobilization approaches are applied to fluorescence microarray and label-free nanophotonic biosensing. All the exposed reactions have in common the photoactivation of the thiol moieties, and give rise to quick, clean, versatile, orthogonal and biocompatible reactions. Water is the only solvent used, and light the only catalyzer applied. Thus, all of them can be considered as having the attributes of click-chemistry reactions. For these reasons we named them as thiol-click photochemistry, being a very interesting pool of possibilities when building a biosensor. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Time weighted average (TWA) concentrations can improve the assessment of water quality. DGT (Diffusive Gradients in Thin films) devices have been suggested as simple tools to measure TWA metal concentrations, but the connection of TWA with C-DGT has not been rigorously discussed. It is shown here that C-DGT is the average DGT-labile concentration along the deployment, which suggests that it is well suited to correlate with toxicity effects. In terms of real species, C-DGT is a good estimator of the TWA concentration for simple metal solutions (no ligands are present) when the accumulation takes place under perfect sink conditions. Differences between CDGT and the TWA concentration for short pulses (<40 min), when the transient regime becomes relevant, are reported. In the presence of complexes, C-DGT contains the TWA of the product of the labile fraction times the diffusivity of the complex (relative to that of the free metal). This means that C-DGT can underestimate the TWA of the total metal concentration due to the presence of complexes less mobile than the free metal or not fully labile. These findings are illustrated with Cd, Ni, Mg or Ni + nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) solutions. When only one complex is relevant, as in the Ni + NTA system, a simple correction factor can yield the TWA concentration from C-DGT. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This structural heterogeneity impairs their comprehensive characterization and requires the use of analytical techniques with high resolving power and sensitivity. The use of chromatographic techniques, especially liquid chromatography (LC), has been extremely helpful for the analysis of carbohydrates. However, in many cases, the use of monodimensional LC is not enough to resolve these complex mixtures; then, the use of techniques with a higher resolving power, as multidimensional LC, could be a good alternative. To the best of our knowledge, our findings are pioneer in applying online LC x LC for the analysis of carbohydrate mixtures. For this purpose, different conditions such as stationary phases (BEH amide, C-18 and PGC columns) and chromatographic conditions for the separation of di- and trisaccharide mixtures were optimized. The BEH amide x C-18 combination was selected for the LC x LC analysis of carbohydrate standards with different degrees of polymerization, linkages and monomeric units. In order to allow their proper UV detection, carbohydrates were previously derivatized using p-aminobenzoic ethyl ester. This method also resulted to be successful for the separation of commercial prebiotic mixtures of galacto-oligosaccharides and gentio-oligosaccharides. This is the first time that LC x LC has been applied for the separation of bioactive carbohydrate mixtures and it could be considered as a powerful analytical technique for the characterization of other oligosaccharide complex mixtures.

AB This report demonstrates that a microfluidic device with integrated silicon filter exhibits outstanding capture efficiency and superior enrichment purity when employed to separate tumor cells from whole blood samples. We fabricate the silicon filter with pyramidal microcavity array (MCA) by micro-fabrication. We design the structure of the cavity to efficiently enrich tumor cells, while allowing hematologic cells to deform and pass through. The capture efficiency of MCF-7, SW620 and Hela cells spiked in 1 mL of whole blood are approximately 80%. Unwanted white blood cells (WBCs) trapped on the MCA are below 0.003%. In addition, this microfluidic device successfully identifies circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in 5 of 6 patients' blood samples, with a range of 5-86 CTCs per mL. These results reveal that the disposable microfluidic device can effectively enrich tumor cells with different sizes and various morphologies, while maintaining high capture efficiency and purity. Therefore, this label-free technique can serve as a versatile platform to facilitate CTCs analysis in diverse biochemical applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanoscience and nanotechnology have emerged in recent years as revolutionary trends in almost all fields of activity. Their impact has taken place in the analytical science, too. Firstly, because the use of nanomaterials as analytical tools is more and more frequent and secondly, because the analytical control of nanomaterials in a wide variety of samples is required. In both aspects, analytical metrology for nanomaterials is involved as the scientific discipline responsible for providing reliable information (based on experimental measurements) to end users. This review presents a general view of the present achievements and the future challenges of analytical metrology for nanomaterials. Selected references and a critical discussion are reported for illustrating this important role of the metrology applied to nano-world. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Instrumental signals of samples cannot be compared and/or analysed directly if their concentrations are unknown. Differences in overall concentration need to be removed at the data normalization step. The choice of normalization method has a profound effect on the final results of data analysis, and especially on biomarker identification. One of the possible approaches to deal with the 'size effect' is to work with size-irrelevant (log) ratios instead of the original variables. In the presented study, the performance of log-ratio methods, namely pairwise log-ratio (plr) and centered log-ratio (clr), is discussed for real and simulated data sets with different characteristics. It was found that the clr method can lead to distribution of local differences along an entire signal and as such, it should be avoided in all studies aiming to identify biomarkers.

ID QUANTIFICATION; CALIBRATION
AB The cumulative standard addition method allows the calibration of an instrument affected by matrix effects when a small sample volume is available. Recently, it was developed and validated a metrologically sound procedure to estimate the uncertainty of these measurements based on the modelling of the uncertainty of the extrapolation of the calibration curve by the linear least squares regression model. However, this procedure is only applicable when the uncertainty of cumulative sample dilutions and analyte mass additions are negligible given the uncertainty of the total solution volume (v) times the instrumental signal (1) (i.e. v.I). This work developed a measurement uncertainty model, not limited by this assumption of the quality of calibrators preparation, based on Monte Carlo simulations. This method was successfully applied to the voltammetric measurements of uric acid in human serum, using a working nanocarbon electrode modified with Cu-nanocarbon-lignin, since the uncertainty model adapts to the uncertainty of cumulative volume additions. The validated procedure was checked through the analysis of spiked physiological serum samples and human serum samples, by assessing the metrological compatibility between estimated and reference values. The measurements are reported with an expanded uncertainty not larger than a target value of 0.56 mg dL(-1). The used spreadsheet is made available as supplementary material. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Graphite from the University of Idaho Thermolyzed Asphalt Reaction (GUITAR) electrode was employed for EIS data collection to achieve enhanced resolution. The obtained EIS Nyquist plots were simulated with the corresponding equivalent circuit to extract the numerical values of parameters which characterize the physicochemical properties of aged Baijiu. The curve fitting data were dimensionally reduced with principle components analysis (PCA). PCA score image originated from GUITAR electrode EIS measurement showed a more defined clustered profile in comparison to glassy carbon electrode. These results implicate GUITAR electrode based EIS is potentially available to develop a household device for aged Baijiu classification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Captavidin, a nitrated avidin with moderate affinity with biotin, irreversibly adsorbs on carboxymethylcellulose to form a regenerable biorecognition element for biotin. This layer was retained and stabilized on a boron-doped diamond electrode by a Nafion film for repeated impedance analyses of biotin down to below 1 nM. The labeless electrochemical sensing scheme was then demonstrated for the analysis of biotin in blood plasma. The incorporation of captavidin confers detection specificity and regenerability, whereas the Nafion and carboxymethylcellulose layers circumvent the diffusion of endogenous electroactive species. The biosensing layer is simply regenerated by applying oxidation of +2 V for 1 min instead of its submersion in carbonate buffer for 10 min. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For fabrication of composite electrode, one-pot strategy is highly attractive for convenience and efficiency. Here, a self-supporting Co3O4/nanoporous gold (NPG) composite electrode was one-pot prepared via one-step in situ anodization of a smooth gold electrode in a CoCl2 solution within 100 s. It worked as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for glucose oxidation and H2O2 reduction in NaOH solution. Under optimized conditions, the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose exhibits a wide linear range from 2 mu M to 2.11 mM with a limit of detection as low as 0.085 mu M (SIN = 3) and an ultrahigh sensitivity of 4470.4 mu A mM(-1)cm(-2). Detection of glucose in human serum samples are also realized with results comparable to those from local hospital. The electrocatalytic reduction of H2O2 shows a linear response range from 20 mu M to 19.1 mM and a high sensitivity of 1338.7 mu A mM(-1)cm (-2). The present results demonstrate that the facilely prepared Co3O4/NPG is a promising nonenzymatic sensor for rapid amperometric detection of glucose and H2O2 with ultrasensitivity, high selectivity, satisfactory reproducibility, good stability and long duration.

AB The dielectric properties of cells are directly related to their morphological and physiological properties and can be used to monitor their status when exposed to stress conditions. In this work, dual-frequency dielectrophoresis (DEP) cytometry was employed to measure changes in the membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity of single Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells during the progression of starvation-induced apoptosis. Our dual-frequency DEP cytometer enables simultaneous measurement of multiple dielectric properties of single cells and identification of their state (viable or apoptotic) within a heterogeneous sample. We employed one frequency to determine each cell's viability state and the other frequency to characterize the change in membrane capacitance or cytoplasm conductivity. Cells were starved by incubation in a medium lacking glucose and glutamine and monitored every 12 h over a 64 h period. Our results showed a subpopulation of early apoptotic cells emerged after 40 h in the starvation medium, which rapidly increased during the next 12 h. After 52 h, a complete transition from viable to apoptotic state was observed. Analyzing the subpopulation of viable cells over the first 52 h showed that the membrane capacitance gradually declined from an initial value of 2.0 to 1.2 mu F/cm(2), and was 0.9 mu F/cm(2) for apoptotic cells. The cytoplasm conductivity of viable cells initially remained constant and then declined from 0.40 to 0.27 S/m after 40 h, coinciding with onset of apoptotic processes. A dramatic decrease in cytoplasm conductivity from 0.27 to 0.07 S/m was observed after 52 h, corresponding to apoptotic cells. As membrane capacitance is related to membrane morphology and cytoplasm conductivity is related to intracellular ion concentrations, the results indicate that during controlled starvation the cell membrane smooths gradually whereas intracellular ion concentrations are initially maintained near homeostatic levels until a later dramatic decline occurs.

AB Electroosmotic flow (EOF) in nanochannels as small as 85 nm and in small microchannels is systematically investigated by using the current-slope method. The effects of ion size, ion valence and pH of electrolyte solutions on the velocity of electroosmotic flow are experimentally studied. The results show that the large size of hydrated ions leads to higher EOF velocity in large nanochannels and microchannels, and, however, lower EOF velocity in small nanochannels with an overlapped electric double layer (EDL). Furthermore, the EOF velocity is proportional to the pH of the electrolyte solution and contrariwise proportional to the valence of counter-ions. It is also observed that the EOF velocity depends on the channel size in nanochannels, even without overlapped EDL. Several models of electric double layer (EDL) are proposed to explain the experimental results and provide an improved understanding of the effects of ion size, ion valence and pH of electrolyte solutions on the EOF velocity in nanochannels in terms of EDL structure.

AB We herein describe a novel method for the detection of target protein based on the target-responsive DNA polymerase activity. In the sensor, two different types of DNA aptamers with the respective functions: one binds to the target protein and the other binds to DNA polymerase, are rationally engineered and combined to form the detection probe that regulates DNA polymerase activity in response to the target protein. In the presence of target protein, the detection probe becomes destabilized and stops the inhibition of DNA polymerase activity. Consequently, the active DNA polymerase initiates the primer extension reaction on the target-specific DNA aptamer, which recycles the target protein to promote another activation cycle of DNA polymerase. In addition, DNA polymerase also catalyzes the primer extension reaction on the primer/template complex in conjugation with TaqMan probe, leading to the significantly enhanced fluorescence intensities. With this novel strategy, we detected a model target protein, lysozyme with a limit of detection as low as 0.80 nM. In addition, the practical applicability of this system was successfully demonstrated by determining lysozyme in human serum. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel, simple, and label-free amplification electrochemical impedance method for quantitative detection of Human T-lymphotropic virus types II(HTLV-II) via click chemistry-mediated of hairpin DNA probes (hairpins) with polymers was developed. The hairpins were firstly attached to the gold electrode surface by an S-Au bond, the azido terminals of hairpins were close to the electrode surface, which make it difficult to be approached. After hybridizing with HTLV-II, the hairpins were unfolded and experienced a big configuration change, which made the azido terminals of the hairpins available to conjugate with alkynyl-containing polymer, called P(DEB-DSDA), formed by 1,4-diacetylenebenzene (DEB) and 4,4'-Diazido-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid disodium salt tetrahydrate (DSDA) via Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). With amount of P(DEB-DSDA) conjugated with the hairpin probes via click polymerization, its electrochemical signal can have a great amplification. Under optimized experimental conditions, this new probe showed a low detection limit of 0.171 pM with a good liner in the range of 1 pM-1 nM. Meanwhile, the biosensor also exhibited good selectivity and reliability in detection of real serum samples, indicating that it has great application potential in clinical DNA diagnosis and detection.

AB In this study, a molecularly imprinted polymer photoelectrochemcal (MIP-PEC) sensor based on semiconducting organic polymer dots (Pdots) and inorganic CdS quantum dots (QDs) has been established for the determination of alpha-Solanine. Specifically, p-type Pdots (p-Pdots) and n-type CdS QDs (n-CdS) were utilized to form organic-inorganic nanoparticles p-n heterojunction to enhance signal response, and their specific energy levels (VB/CB or HOMO/LUMO) were calculated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioanalysis application. At the same time, the combination of molecular imprinting technology and photoelectrochemistry overcomes the defeats of photoelectrochemistry which is the absence of selectivity, offers a new MIP-PEC sensor with high sensitivity and excellent selectivity based heterojunction enhanced strategy. In short, this study proposes the semiconducting organic-inorganic nanoparticles p-n heterojunction for molecularly imprinted polymer photoelectrochemcal bioanalysis application, and the MIP-PEC sensor was successfully fabricated based on these materials and methods. In the phosphate buffer solution (PBS), it was clearly observed that the photocurrent has a significant change between elution in acetic acid-ethanol mixture and incubation in template molecular solution because of the faster electron transfer speed, this phenomenon fully showed that the MIP-PEC sensor can specifically detect the target. Thus, the work typically offers a linear range from 0.01 to 1000 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 6.5 pg mL(-1) for alpha-Solanine. Furthermore, the fabricated MIP-PEC sensor will confirm the actual application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although interactions between lipids and membrane proteins (MPs) have been considered crucially important for understanding the functions of lipids, lack of useful and convincing experimental methods has hampered the analysis of the interactions. Here, we developed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based concise method for quantitative analysis of lipid-MP interactions, coating the sensor chip surface with self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with C-6-chain. To develop this method, we used bacteriorhodopsin (bR) as an MP, and examined its interaction with various types of lipids. The merits of using C-6-SAM-modified sensor chip are as follows: (1) alkyl-chains of SAM confer a better immobilization of MPs because of the efficient preconcentration due to hydrophobic contacts; (2) SAM provides immobilized MPs with a partial membranous environment, which is important for the stabilization of MPs; and (3) a thinner C-6-SAM layer (1 nm) compared with MP size forces the MP to bulge outward from the SAM surface, allowing extraneously injected lipids to be accessible to the hydrophobic transmembrane regions. Actually, the amount of bR immobilized on C-6 -SAM is 10 times higher than that on a hydrophilic CM5 sensor chip, and AFM observations confirmed that bR molecules are exposed on the SAM surface. Of the lipids tested, S-TGA-1, a halobacterium-derived glycolipid, had the highest specificity to bR with a nanomolar dissociation constant. This is consistent with the reported co-crystal structure that indicates the formation of several intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Therefore, we not only reproduced the specific lipid-bR recognition, but also succeeded in its quantitative evaluation, demonstrating the validity and utility of this method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one of the main source of oxidative stress and a typical marker of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated diseases. Therefore, selective detection and scavenging of overproduced H2O2 provide enormous benefits to the successful treatment of ROS-related diseases. The authors took advantage of this property to detect cancer cells using chemiluminescent peroxyoxalate reaction. Here, a new contrast agent presented for hydrogen peroxide, termed peroxyoxalate liposomes, which detect hydrogen peroxide through chemiluminescence reaction, and have the physical/chemical properties needed for imaging applications. The peroxyoxalate liposomes are composed of Bis (2, 4, 6-trichlorphenyl) oxalate (TCPO) and curcumin as fluorophore. Experimental factors such as TCPO, imidazole, hydrogen peroxide and curcumin concentration were optimized. Moreover, application of curcumin makes it possible to design a system for selective tumor destruction. In the reaction of peroxyoxalate, it acts as an oxalate activator with intracellular hydrogen peroxide and experiences excitation as a result of the reaction. In addition, curcumin also acts as a photosensitizer (PS) causing cell damage. In the optimum conditions, the measurable concentration range of 0.86-220 mu M of hydrogen peroxide were evaluated from the linear calibration curve with satisfactory RSD% and corresponding detection limits of 650 nM. Therefore, it has the sensitivity needed to detect physiological concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, cellular uptake experiments showed that the liposomes enhance extravasation into permeable membranes and significantly increased the bioavailability of curcumin. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study describes the high sensitivity and the reduced ion suppression and matrix effect that can be achieved by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) in the analysis of dried spices as complex matrices. Samples selected for the evaluation were cayenne and black pepper, which are representative of complex dried spices. To carry out the evaluation of this technique, blank samples were fortified with a solution containing 162 pesticides at two concentration levels (50 and 200 mu g kg(-1)). During the modified QuEChERS method, EMR sorbent was used as dispersive SPE in the clean-up step. The samples were analysed by supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The validation parameters studied were recovery, inter and intraday precision, linearity and matrix effect. Recoveries for the majority of compounds were in the 70-120% range recommended by DG-SANTE guidelines and showed a precision lower than 20% in terms of RSD. Matrix effect was low (0-20% signal suppression) for 132 pesticides in cayenne and 91 in black pepper. The method was used to analyse 47 real samples of spices from different countries. A high number of these samples presented one or more pesticides (81%). Some of these detected pesticides are not approved in the European Union and, in many cases, the positive findings exposed concentrations that exceed the EU MRLs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The problems of contamination of many products by nitroso compounds have been discussed since 1970's and have been partially solved, namely, the contamination by carcinogenic volatile N-nitrosamines. However, there is still a gap in knowing non-volatile nitroso compounds in terms of both the determination of these compounds and the description of their toxicity. Therefore, a procedure for their detailed non-targeted study is necessary to be developed. Based on these facts, a new method permitting the detection and the classification of nitroso compound groups, such as N-nitroso, C-nitroso, and interfering substances in the nitrosamine specific chemiluminescence detection after previous gas chromatographic separation, was developed. The method is based on signal profiling of chromatographic peaks recorded by a chemiluminescence detector at different pyrolytic temperatures and subsequent multivariate chemometric classification. The resulting classification function by linear discriminant analysis shows good performance with total accuracy of 96.12% after the method validation. The method was successfully applied and demonstrated on a non-targeted beer sample analysis. Nitroso compounds detected by the method were selected for detailed structural analysis by GC-MS/MS. The combination of the presented method with the MS/MS instrumentation provides a really powerful analytical tool for the identification of unknown nitroso compounds in complex samples. This study represents a valuable contribution to the protocols of identification of organic compounds with the nitrogen functional groups - toxicologically and analytically important nitroso compounds.

AB Most of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioassays need to immobilize biomolecules on electrodes, which lead to tedious modification processes, damaged biomolecules, as well as crippled sensitivity/accuracy and low throughput of the performances. To overcome these drawbacks, we now introduce an exquisitely split-mode (which separates the bioreaction (performed in microplates) from the PEC detection (conducted in PEC cell)) cathodic photoelectrochemistry for probing versatile biocatalytic events with high throughput. Specifically, the enzymatically in situ generated 1,2-bezoquinone was covalently attached onto the PbSe quantum dots (QDs) modified indium tin oxide (ITO) (ITO/PbSe) photocathode through the connector of chitosan (CS). And the attached 1,2-bezoquinone acted as an efficient electron acceptor to promote the cathodic photocurrent of the ITO/PbSe electrode, enabling us to probe quinones-generating oxidoreductase (by taking horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a model) coupled biocatalytic cascades including the alkaline phosphatase (ALP)/HRP and the glucose oxidase (GOx)/HRP cascades. Quantitative probing for ALP activity in a wide linear range of 5.0 x 10(-3) to 10 U/L with the detection limit of 1.2 x 10(-3) U/L was realized. While a wide linear range of 5.0 x 10(-8) to 1.0 x 10(-4) moL/L with a quite low detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-8) moL/L was obtained for the glucose assay. In addition, this testing protocol was also extended to an immunoassay (taking carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as an example) using HRP as a catalytic tracer. The developed bioassays show high sensitivity and good selectivity for CEA detection in the linear range from 0.1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.02 pg/mL. Moreover, the proposed detection has distinctive merits because it not only avoids the adverse effects of the surface confined biomolecules for crippling the signal transduction, but also it has enhanced throughput.

AB The present tutorial paper is aimed to analyse and critically discuss the consequences of row pre-processing (conversion of measurement units, derivatives, and standard normal variate transform) on the evaluation of final outcomes of chemometric data analysis. An in-depth focus on pre-processing effects both on the signal shape and on misinterpretation of results - a crucial and disregarded issue in the analytical field - is presented. It is shown how this preliminary step of data processing may lead, in many cases, to draw incongruous conclusions, not actually based on real information embodied within data, but on artefacts arising from the mathematical transforms. This tutorial is not limited to a description of the problem, it also introduces strategies and tools for overcoming such unwanted effects, allowing a direct interpretation of the importance of original variables to be performed, explaining the chemical information that actually characterises samples. The dangerous implications of row preprocessing on instrumental signals is demonstrated on real datasets coming from different analytical techniques: transmission and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Hence, the impact of this widespread problem in most of the branches of analytical chemistry is illustrated. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of the computer language Forth for controlling experimental analytical instruments built in laboratories is described. Forth runs on a microcontroller and as it is an interpreted language the user can directly communicate with it by employing a terminal emulator program running on a personal computer. Thus the user can test attached hardware, such as pumps, valves, electronic pressure regulators, detectors and chemical sensors, directly from the keyboard. This overcomes the lack of interactivity, a significant shortcoming, of the computer languages C and C++, the default on such microcontroller platforms as the Arduinos, which have become very popular in recent years for laboratory applications. Common examples of purpose built experimental analytical laboratory instruments are sequential injection analysis systems, microfluidic devices, or automated sample extraction systems. Application examples from our laboratory are given, namely the regulation of mass-flow controllers for gases, the sequencing of an experimental capillary electrophoresis instrument and the acquisition of a signal from an alcohol sensor.

AB The presence of asbestos in the environment has caused concern because exposure to asbestos can cause diseases such as stomach and pancreatic cancer. However, suitable up-to-date methods for quantitatively analyzing asbestos and assessing the toxicity of asbestos have not been developed. In this study, asbestos in drinking water was characterized using a stepwise multiple differential infra-red spectra method and a partial least squares method. The in vivo migration of ingested asbestos in mice was then investigated using the technique. The quantification limit of six kinds of asbestos by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in water are respectively from 0.0468 to 0.0705 mg/L, from 0.0039 to 0.0064 mg/L. The relative standard deviations were respectively less than 2.85% and 3.81%. The recoveries of the test asbestos were respectively more than 95.10% and 95.38%. Asbestos was found mainly to accumulate in the livers of mice. The Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry method can be used to detect and precisely quantify asbestos in water samples and in animal tissues.

AB The self-absorption effect due to optically thick property greatly influences the measured line intensities as well as the performance of quantification for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) especially for calibration-free LIBS which requires proper correction. In this paper, a new self-absorption correction method for Calibration-Free LIBS (CF-LIBS), called blackbody radiation referenced self-absorption correction (BRR-SAC) is proposed. An iterative algorithm was designed to calculate the plasma temperature and normally hard-to-obtain collection efficiency of the optical collection system by directly comparing the measured spectrum with the corresponding theoretical blackbody radiation for self-absorption correction. Compared with generally applied self-absorption correction methods based on the principle of curve of growth, the proposed method has obvious advantages of simpler programming, higher computation efficiency, and its independency of the availability or accuracy of line broadening coefficients. Experiments were conducted on titanium alloy samples. The experimental results showed that the self-absorption was corrected with increased linearity of the Boltzmann plots and the measurement accuracy of the elemental concentration was significantly improved through BRR-SAC. Compared with the traditional CF-LIBS with self-absorption correction, the proposed method also showed better performance. In addition, BRR-SAC provides a simple way to obtain the collection efficiency of the experimental setup, which benefits the plasma diagnostics and quantitative analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Learning patterns from spectra is critical for the development of chemometric analysis of spectroscopic data. Conventional two-stage calibration approaches consist of data preprocessing and modeling analysis. Misuse of preprocessing may introduce artifacts or remove useful patterns and result in worse model performance. An end-to-end deep learning approach incorporated Inception module, named DeepSpectra, is presented to learn patterns from raw data to improve the model performance. DeepSpectra model is compared to three CNN models on the raw data, and 16 preprocessing approaches are included to evaluate the preprocessing impact by testing four open accessed visible and near infrared spectroscopic datasets (corn, tablets, wheat, and soil). DeepSpectra model outperforms the other three convolutional neural network models on four datasets and obtains better results on raw data than in preprocessed data for most scenarios. The model is compared with linear partial least square (PLS) and nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) methods and support vector machine (SVR) on raw and preprocessed data. The results show that DeepSpectra approach provides improved results than conventional linear and nonlinear calibration approaches in most scenarios. The increased training samples can improve the model repeatability and accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB When analyzing high-dimensional near-infrared (NIR) spectral datasets, variable selection is critical to improving models' predictive abilities. However, some methods have many limitations, such as a high risk of overfitting, time-intensiveness, or large computation demands, when dealing with a high number of variables. In this study, we propose a hybrid variable selection strategy based on the continuous shrinkage of variable space which is the core idea of variable combination population analysis (VCPA). The VCPA-based hybrid strategy continuously shrinks the variable space from big to small and optimizes it based on modified VCPA in the first step. It then employs iteratively retaining informative variables (IRIV) and a genetic algorithm (GA) to carry out further optimization in the second step. It takes full advantage of VCPA, GA, and IRIV, and makes up for their drawbacks in the face of high numbers of variables. Three NIR datasets and three variable selection methods including two widely-used methods (competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, CARS and genetic algorithm-interval partial least squares, GA-iPLS) and one hybrid method (variable importance in projection coupled with genetic algorithm, VIP -GA) were used to investigate the improvement of VCPA-based hybrid strategy. The results show that VCPA-GA and VCPA-IRIV significantly improve model's prediction performance when compared with other methods, indicating that the modified VCPA step is a very efficient way to filter the uninformative variables and VCPA-based hybrid strategy is a good and promising strategy for variable selection in NIR.

AB In this work, a high integrated water detection system comprised a miniaturized and high precision homemade colorimeter, a microfluidic analysis module and a wireless module was reported. A reagent reaction based on the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method was recorded for the estimation of phosphate in natural water. A laser self-modulating module of 880 nm was used as the radiation source. A microfluidic chip was employed to fit the colorimeter with an optimized micro flow path for low liquid consumption and high precision detection. The wireless module consisted of two parts, using ZigBee and GSM modules to realize short and remote displaying and controlling. Applying a novel optimized algorithm, a wide linear response was obtained ranging from 0.02 up to 9.5 mgL(-1). The optimization of colorimeterare mainly in the core detection part, allowing an improvement of the detection limit, achieving a result of 0.009 mgL(-1). A low reagent consumption of 0.004 mg ascorbic acid and 0.011 mg ammonium molybdate for per determination was attained. Experimental results have also shown that the system could maintain good stability among broad room temperature changing from 17 degrees C to 35 degrees C with less energy consumption. The miniaturized colorimeter-based water detection system opens new avenue for operating in remote distance to get high precision measurements of phosphate in natural water. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, graphite nanosheets (GN) were first prepared through simple liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite powder in N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC). After then, ultrasmall Cu-based metal organic frame (HKUST-1) nanoparticles (less than 5 nm) were in-situ anchored on the surface of graphite nanosheets with high degree of dispersion. Due to the intrinsic structural advantages of the as-synthesized HKUST-1 nanoparticles decorated graphite nanosheets (HKUST-1/GN) hybrids, including superior electron transfer ability and the greatly enhanced adsorption property, HKUST-1/GN shows excellent electrochemical sensing performance toward DNA damage biomarker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine with fast detection speed (similar to 240 s), wide linear window (10 nM-1 mu M), high sensitivity (346857 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)), low detection limit (similar to 2.5 nM), and good reproducibility. As a result, a highly sensitive electrochemical sensing platform for the detection of DNA damage biomarker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine was fabricated basing the as-prepared HKUST-1/GN hybrids. What is more, the developed electrochemical method was successfully used for the detection of real samples and exhibited satisfied result. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Paper based biosensor devices have the benefit of easy-use, low-cost and environmental friendly for point-of-care diagnostic application. In this research, we report a novel form of paper based biosensor with hierarchical assembled nanomaterials and MOF enhanced bio-probes for the simultaneous detection of microRNA-141 (miR-141) and microRNA-21 (miR-21) which have the potential for early cancer detection. The combination of multi-dimensional nanomaterial allows low impedance and high sensing area on typical poorly defined paper substrate. MOF conjugated bio-probe, methylene blue (MB) and ferrocene (Fc) with distinguishable electrochemical signal, further contributed to the high selectivity and sensitivity. Simultaneously detection of miR-141 and miR-21 with a detection limit of 0.1 fM was demonstrated under optimal conditions. All these features enable accurately target detection in serum samples. Therefore, this strategy is of promising as an inexpensive, easy access diagnosis platform for cancers by means of simultaneously detection of a variety of miRNA biomarkers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Owing to their multiscale pore size regimes and unique properties, the materials with hierarchically porous structures have become an important family of functional materials in recent years. They have been applied from energy conversion and storage, catalysis, separation to drug delivery, etc. The synthesis of them is difficult by the need to employ multiple templates and take complicated steps. Herein, we successfully prepared epoxy-functionalized hierarchically porous hybrid monoliths (HPHMs) with micro/meso/macro-structures in an easy way. Firstly, a bulk monolithic material was formed via free radical polymerization between polyhedral oligomeric vinylsilsesquioxanes (vinylPOSS) and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) in the presence of polycaprolactone (PCL). Then PCL was degraded with hydrochloric acid solution, and the epoxy-functionalized HPHM was obtained. This approach was very simple and suitable for large-scale preparation. Hybrid monoliths with different specific surface area (from 5.4 to 636.7 m(2)/g) were prepared by adjusting the mole ratio of vinylPOSS to AGE and the content of PCL. The results of several characterization methods, including nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), showed that these materials contained not only micropores and mesopores but also macropores. The materials were further modified with penicillamine to be used as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) adsorbents for enriching N-glycopeptides in IgG and serum protein tryptic digests. Up to 23 N-glycopeptides were identified from IgG digest, and 385 N-glycopeptides and 283 N-glycosylation sites were identified from human serum digest. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing researches proved that abnormal glycosylation is strongly correlated with many diseases. Specially, site-specific glycosylation and its associated heterogeneity are closely related to the function and activity of the glycoprotein. However, intact N-glycopeptide analysis still faces great challenges because the presence of highly abundant non-glycosylated peptides would suppress the ionization of lowly abundant glycopeptides. In the present study, we developed a practical intact tryptic N-glycopeptide enrichment method using acrylamide-agarose composite gel that combined the size exclusion chromatography and hydrophilic (named SELIC) effects, aimed to remove the detergent rapidly and effectively, as well as enrich intact N-glycopeptides while extracting peptides. This is a useful tool to facilitate the intact N-glycopeptides analysis of complex protein mixtures, particularly for samples that extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues by SDS. Using this method, we successfully identified 700 site-specific intact tryptic N-glycopeptides corresponding to 261 glycosylation sites on 191 glycoproteins from FFPE thymoma tissues.

AB Materials in direct contact with food should be monitored for the presence of species able to migrate into food. A direct method based on liquid extraction surface analysis nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (LESA-nanoESl-MS) was developed for the analysis of the migrating species from a polymer film. Different types of molecules: post-polymerization residues, degradation products (oligomers resulting from polymer recycling, products of polymer oxidative degradation) and anti-oxidant additives (vitamin E) were demonstrated to be detected and identified, and determined quantitatively if relevant calibration standards are available. The method was validated by a comparison a standard method based on with bulk extraction mass spectrometry. It offers considerable advantages over the latter in terms of drastically reduced analysis time and solvent consumption. Also, LESA-nanoESl-MS produced simpler spectra (limited to compounds able to migrate into food) than Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The analysis of persistent organic pollutants, such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) including perfluorooctanoic acid (C2F15COOH, PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (C8F17SO3-, PFOS) by hyphenated chromatography-mass spectrometry methods is crucial in ensuring water quality. One of the challenges in PFOA and PFOS analysis is the separation of linear and branched isomers that have the same mass-to-charge ratio but can have different toxicological properties. Current methods that are used for separating isomeric PFAS require relatively long analysis times (min to h) that can limit throughput. An emerging technique for the direct analysis of isomeric compounds is differential mobility spectrometry (DMS), which can rapidly separate gas phase ions prior to detection by mass spectrometry (MS). However, an ion mobility-based method for the analysis of PFAS has not been reported in the literature. Herein, high-resolution DMS-MS is used to separate and detect isomeric PFAS compounds for the first time in a separation process that occurs in milliseconds. The resolution of isomeric peaks increased by over 200% and 500% for PFOA and PFOS isomers, respectively, using a DMS carrier gas composed of 50:50% He:N-2 by volume compared to 100% N-2, which was crucial in the separation of PFAS isomers under these conditions. Linear, secondary-branched, and tertiary-branched isomers of PFOA and PFOS including those that differ by the position of a single perfluoromethyl group can be resolved by DMS-MS. The DMS compensation field required to transmit different isomers increases as the extent of branching increases. For isomeric PFASs with a single branching point, the compensation field for optimal transmission also increases as the perfluoromethyl group is positioned closer to the carboxylate and sulfonate groups under these conditions. These results indicate that high-resolution DMS-MS should be a useful approach for the rapid analysis of isomeric PFAS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on conjugate addition-cyclization reaction of Cys with acrylate and subsequent 1,6-elimination of p-hydroxybenzyl moiety, a novel colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent probe 1 was designed and synthesized. Upon addition of Cys to the solution of 1, the absorption spectra changed from 508 nm to 452 nm (Delta 56 nm) and afforded visible color change from pink to yellow. Meanwhile, the emission spectra shifted from 644 nm to 539 nm (Delta 105 nm) with remarkable changes in the emission ratio of F-539 nm/F-644 nm (R/R-0 up to 760-fold), accompanying with an obvious fluorescence change from orange to green under illumination with a 365 nm UV lamp. In addition, 1 exhibited a large Stokes shift (136 nm), high sensitivity (detection limit of 46.7 nM), and excellent selectivity to Cys over Hcy and GSH. Moreover, 1 can discriminate Cys from Hcy and GSH by fluorescence spectra, even obvious visible and fluorescence color changes. Importantly, 1 can be used to image Cys in living cells by dual emission channels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple fluorescence turn on sensor for the detection of fluoride ion in totally aqueous medium has been developed by integrating boronic acid functionalized carbon quantum dot (BNSCQD) and dopamine. The intense emission of BNSCQD is quenched due to photoelectron transfer (PET) from BNSCQD to dopamine. A remarkable enhancement of emission intensity in presence of F- is achieved due to high reactivity of F- towards boron centre of the BNSCQD-dopamine complex and hence restricting PET between BNSCQD and dopamine. The LOD of our sensor is 0.7 pM. The sensor is not cytotoxic and could be utilised to trace fluoride level changes in human serum as well as in living cells. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione (GSH) play many crucial physiological roles in organisms. Their abnormal levels can cause and indicate various diseases. In the present study, a small-molecule fluorescent probe 2-(imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-2-yl)phenyl acrylate (IPPA) was designed, synthesized and characterized by NMR, FT-IR and HRMS. IPPA can selectively detect Cys over other analytes because of an approximately 76 times enhancement in fluorescence intensity. The limit of detection of IPPA for Cys was 0.33 mu M. The pseudo-first-order rate constant of the reaction between IPPA and Cys was approximately 10 times that of the reaction between IPPA and Hcy (K-cys 3.18 x 10(-3)S(-1) vs K-H(cy) 4.92 x 10(-4)S(-1)), indicating that Cys can be distinguished from Hcy. In addition, IPPA exhibits strong anti-interference ability, small molecular weight, high efficiency, low toxicity and good cell permeability. It was successfully used in imaging HepG2 cells and zebrafish. The fluorescence response of IPPA for calf serum are powerful proofs for practical application. Therefore, IPPA has high potential for bioassay applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We prepared an ultrathin porous silica shell-coated Au-Ag alloy nanoparticle (AuAg@p-SiO2NP) and developed it as a novel alkyne-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe for the ratiometric Raman imaging of exogenous and endogenous H2O2 in live cells. The AuAg@p-SiO(2)NPs functionalized with 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) and 4-mercaptophenylacetylene (MPAE, 1986 cm(-1)) as internal standard were first incubated with dopamine (DA) to incorporate the bridging molecules through the formation of borate bond between DA and MPBA on the surface of nanoparticle. Then, the signaling alkyne molecules of 3-(4-(phenylethynyl) benzylthio) propanoic acid (PEB, 2214 cm(-1)) were conjugated to the surface of nanoparticle through the formation of amide bond between the carboxyl group on the PEB and the amino group on the DA, forming the ratiometric SERS nanoprobe. In the presence of H2O2, the alkynyl on the PEB is released from the surface of the Au-Ag alloy nanoparticle due to the boronate-to-phenol switch, decreasing the Raman signal at 2214 cm(-1) significantly. Since the Raman signal of MPAE at 1986 cm(-1) remains unchanged, quantitative analysis of H2O2 concentration can be achieved based on the ratiometric value of I-1986/I-2214. Under the optimized conditions, the plot of the ratiometric value of I-1986/I-2214 versus the H2O2 concentration in the range from 0.12 to 8 mu M revealed a good linear response with a detection limit of 52 nM based on a signal-to-noise ratio of S/N = 3. The porous SiO2-coated Au-Ag alloy nanoparticle provides a novel SERS substrate with excellent biocompatibility, high stability, and effective anti-interference ability. Together with the alkynyl derivatives as internal standard, the SERS nanoprobe reported here allows the ratiometric detection of H2O2 in live cells and can be further applied to quantify many other biomolecules by using different signaling agents.

AB All substances migrating from food contact materials (FCMs), such as packagings, into food must be safe. This presupposes comprehensive analysis of all constituents potentially reaching a concentration in food that may be of toxicological concern. There is no single technique meeting this task and usually several need to be combined. In many cases, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) is the best technique available to start with. It provides high resolution and an overview in well-structured plots, grouping similar substances in a manner facilitating identifications. Further, flame ionization detection (FID) enables approximate quantitation without standards, and electron impact (EI) fragmentation in mass spectrometry (MS) provides access to large libraries for identification. GC is limited in amenable molecular mass, but the characterization of the lower mass constituents is usually helpful also for the identification of higher mass ones by techniques like HPLC-MS. The scope of this paper is to advocate the use of GCxGC for comprehensive migrate analysis, based on advantages illustrated by examples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For the identification and quantification of analytes in complex samples, highly selective analytical strategies are required. The selectivity of single separation techniques such as gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), or capillary electrophoresis (CE) with common detection principles can be enhanced by hyphenating orthogonal separation techniques but also by using complementary detection systems. In this review, two-dimensional systems containing CE in at least one dimension are reviewed, namely LC-CE or 2D CE systems. Particular attention is paid to the aspect of selectivity enhancement due to the orthogonality of the different separation mechanisms. As an alternative concept, dual detection approaches are reviewed using the common detectors of CE such as UV/VIS, laser-induced fluorescence, capacitively coupled contactless conductivity ((CD)-D-4), electrochemical detection, and mass spectrometry. Special emphasis is given to dual detection systems implementing the highly flexible (CD)-D-4 as one detection component. Selectivity enhancement can be achieved in case of complementarity of the different detection techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carboxypeptidase B (CPB) is a protease that specifically hydrolyzes C-terminal alkaline amino acid of a peptide, which plays an important role in biological analysis. The activity and inhibition of CPB are significant for peptide sequencing and protein engineering. In this paper, a sensitive and easily-prepared nanochannel system was used to detect the activity of CPB. We assembled the peptides composing of alkaline amino acids into the nanochannels to detect the activity of CPB based on its hydrolysis characteristic. With CPB, the peptides would be cleaved, causing less blocking-effect on the ionic current through nanochannels. This system exhibited high sensitivity (detection limit of 0.01 U mL(-1)), wide linear range (0.01-10 U mL(-1)), and fast response (less than 10 s) for specific CPB detection. We also used the system to detect the effect of CPB inhibitors and detect in complex actual samples. The strategy exhibits effective analytical characteristics and it can be regarded as a hopeful prospect for the rapid diagnosis of patients with pancreatitis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, an immunosensor using CdTe@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles as labels was constructed for highly sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In this approach, CdTe@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized using the sol-gel method. The additional Cd ions and sulfur source in SiO2 shell can greatly enhance the fluorescence intensity of CdTe nanocrystals. The reason is the formation of CdS-like cluster in SiO2 shell, which reduced the quantum size effect. The obtained CdTe@SiO2 nanoparticles also exhibited excellent biocompatibility, which was ideal for applying in biomarker detection. Furthermore, PSA capture antibodies functionalized magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-Ab1) were utilized in the proposed immunosensor to capture and enrich the PSA. The captured PSA was then immuno-recognized by CdTe@SiO2 labeled with PSA detection antibodies (CdTe@SiO2-Ab(2)) by forming the sandwich complex Fe3O4-Ab(1)/PSA/Ab(2)-CdTe@SiO2. The construction of this immunosensor was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The proposed immunosensor showed a good linear relationship between the fluorescent intensity and the target PSA concentration ranging from 0.01 to 5 ng/mL, and a detection limit as low as 0.003 ng/mL was achieved. The sensor also exhibited good specificity to PSA. This highly sensitive and specific immunosensor has great potential to be used in other biological detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sensing of pyrophosphate anion (PPi) in the presence of nucleotide triphosphates allows the real time monitoring of the polymerase chain reaction. To get a deeper understanding of the factors involved in PPi/nucleotide triphosphate discrimination, a detailed study on the performance of a dimethyltin (IV)-catecholate complex capable of both separate fluorimetric or electrochemical detection of PPi in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has been undertaken. Dimethyltin (IV) tightly binds PPi or ATP, and forms a stable 1:1 complex with tiron (4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid) in water. The complexation equilibria with all components are characterized quantitatively by potentiometric and spectroscopic titrations. Pyrophosphate anion can be detected owing to its ability to release free tiron from the complex by measuring either a fluorimetric or an electrochemical signal. On the contrary, ATP does not displace tiron but causes an interference with PPi in the fluorimetric detection method due to the formation of a ternary Me2Sn(IV)-tiron-ATP complex with optical properties intermediate between those of free and bound tiron. In the electrochemical (square wave voltammetry) method, the ternary ATP complex shows a separate peak which does not coincide with the peaks of neither free nor bound tiron, thus making possible the simultaneous detection of ATP in addition to PPi.

AB Mass spectrometry allows the relative quantification of the regioisomers of triacylglycerides by the calibration of their fragmentation patterns. However, due to the plethora of regioisomers of triacylglycerides, calibration with every standard is not feasible. An analytical challenge in the field is the prediction of the fragmentation patterns of triacylglycerides to quantify their regioisomers. Thus, we aimed to model these fragmentation patterns to quantify the regioisomeric composition, even for those without commercially available standards. In a first step, we modeled the fragmentation patterns of the regioisomers of triacylglycerides obtained from different published datasets. We found the same qualitative trends of fragmentation beyond differences in the type of adduct in these datasets (both [M+NH4](+) and [M+H](+)), and the type of instrument (orbitrap, Q-ToF, ion-trap, single quadrupole, and triple quadrupole). However, the quantitative trends of fragmentation were adduct and instrument specific. From these observations, we modeled quantitatively the common trends of fragmentation of triacylglycerides in every dataset. In a second step, we applied this methodology on a Synapt G2S Q-ToF to quantify the regioisomers of triacylglycerides in sunflower and olive oils. The results of our quantification were in good agreement with previous published quantifications of triacylglycerides, even for regioisomers that were not present in the training dataset. The species with more than two highly unsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids) showed a complex behavior and lower predictability of their fragmentation patterns. However, this framework presents the capacity to model this behavior when more data are available. It would be also applicable to standardize the quantification of the regioisomers of triacylglycerides in an inter-laboratory ring study. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple, rapid and high throughput analytical approach with combination of mechanochemical extraction (MCE) and direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) analysis was developed for the simultaneous determination of multiple chemical components in cigarette fillers. Different kinds of substances including nicotine, cigarette alkaloids, carbohydrates, organic acids, humectants and other additives were successfully extracted using MCE and detected by high resolution DART-MS. Six solvents of various polarities were compared during MCE process and significant differences were observed. Different brands of cigarettes as well as standard research cigarette exhibited distinctive chemical features and DART-MS fingerprints. Principle component analysis showed clear differentiation among different cigarettes extracted with the same solvent and different solvent extracts of the same type of cigarette. The putative chemical formulas were proposed based on accurate m/z values with <10 ppm mass errors. The relative contents of nicotine and other identified substances were compared and significant differences were observed among cigarettes of different locations. The whole procedure of MCE combined with DART-MS only takes minutes from raw cigarette fillers to obtaining the semi-quantitative results. The operation is simple and high throughput, providing an efficient method to analyze cigarette composition, and to establish a methodology to acquire the rapid cigarette fingerprints for quality control.

AB A wide range of methods are used to estimate the plant-availability of soil phosphorus (P). Published research has shown that the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique has a superior correlation to plant-available P in soils compared to standard chemical extraction tests. In order to identify the plant-available soil P species, we combined DGT with infrared and P K- and L-2,L-3-edge X-ray adsorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. This was achieved by spectroscopically investigating the dried binding layer of DGT devices after soil deployment. All three spectroscopic methods were able to distinguish between different kinds of phosphates (poly-, trimeta-, pyro- and orthophosphate) on the DGT binding layer. However, infrared spectroscopy was most sensitive to distinguish between different types of adsorbed inorganic and organic phosphates. Furthermore, intermediates of the time-resolved hydrolysis of trimetaphosphate in soil could be analyzed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metal-free fluorescent covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized initially with Q-Graphene (QG) scaffolds by the one-step covalent reactions of melamine-aldehyde and phenol-aldehyde poly-condensations using paraformaldehyde. It was discovered that onion-like hollow QG, which consists of multi-layer graphene and different carbon allotropes having a high proportion of folded edges and surface defects, could endow the scaffolded COFs with enhanced green fluorescence and environmental stability. Unexpectedly, they could exhibit the powerful absorption for Cu2+ ions resulting in the specific quenching of fluorescence. A fluorimetric strategy with QG-scaffolded COFs was thereby developed to probe Cu2+ ions separately in blood and wastewater with the linear concentration ranges of 0.0010 -10.0 mu M (limit of detection of 0.50 nM) and 0.0032-32.0 mu M (limit of detection of 2.4 nM), respectively, promising the potential applications for the field-applicable monitoring of Cu2+ ions in the clinical and environmental analysis fields. In addition, the prepared COFs sorbents were employed to absorb Cu2+ ions in wastewater showing high removal efficiency. More importantly, such an one-pot fabrication route with hollow QG scaffolds may be tailorable extensively for the preparation of a variety of metal-free multifunctional COFs with enhanced fluorescence, water solubility, environmental stability, and metal removal capability.

AB In this work, a novel sensor based on immobilised copper phthalocyanine, 2,9,16,23-tetracarboxylic acid-polyacrylamide (Cu(II)TC Pc-PAA) was developed for determination of acid phosphatase (ACP) levels in nanomolar quantities. Detection was based on the measurement of enzymatically generated phosphate, with initial studies focused on phosphate detection at a Cu(II)TC Pc-PAA modified screen-printed gold transducer. The sensor was characterised in relation to operational performance (pH, response time, stability, linearity, and sensitivity) and common anionic interferents (nitrate, sulphate, chloride, and perchlorate). The functionalised surface also facilitated rapid detection of the enzyme bi-product 2-naphthol over the range 5-3000 mu M. Quantitation of ACP was demonstrated, realising a linear response range of 0.5-20 nM and LOD of 0.5 nM, which is within the clinical range for this prostate cancer biomarker. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lead identification and optimization are essential steps in the development of a new drug. It requires cost-effective, selective and sensitive chemical tools. Here, we report a novel method using nanobodies that allows the efficient screening for potent ligands. The method is illustrated with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator inhibitory factor (Cif), a virulence factor secreted by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 18 nanobodies selective to Cif were isolated by bio-panning from nanobody-phage library constructed from immunized llama. 8 out of 18 nanobodies were identified as potent inhibitors of Cif enzymatic activity with IC(50)s in the range of 0.3-6.4 mu M. A nanobody VHH219 showed high affinity (K-D = 0.08 nM) to Cif and the highest inhibitory potency, IC50 = 0.3 mu M. A displacement sandwich ELISA (dsELISA) with VHH219 was then developed for classification of synthetic small molecule inhibitors according their inhibitory potency. The developed assay allowed identification of new inhibitor with highest potency reported so far (0.16 +/- 0.02 mu M). The results from dsELISA assay correlates strongly with a conventional fluorogenic assay (R = 0.9998) in predicting the inhibitory potency of the tested compounds. However, the novel dsELISA is an order of magnitude more sensitive and allows the identification and ranking of potent inhibitors missed by the classic fluorogenic assay method. These data were supported with Octet biolayer interferometry measurements. The novel method described herein relies solely on the binding properties of the specific neutralizing nanobody, and thus is applicable to any pharmacological target for which such a nanobody can be found, independent of any requirement for catalytic activity.

AB Organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterial has gained much attention due to its excellent performances in bioanalysis and biomedicine. However, the preparation of DNA-inorganic hybrid nanomaterial with suitable size for cell uptake remains a huge challenge. Herein, a moderate biomineralization strategy for synthesis of Y-DNA@Cu-3(PO4)(2) (Y-DNA@CuP) hybrid nanoflowers is reported. Y-DNA with a loop structure is used as both the biomineralization template and the recognition unit for thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) mRNA. The Y-DNA probe can linearly response to TK1 mRNA target sequence in a range from 2 nM to 150 nM with the limit of detection as low as 0.56 nM. Interestingly, the presence of Y-DNA significantly decreases the size of Cu-3(PO4)(2) (CuP) particles, which allows them suitable for intracellular applications as gene nanocarriers. Once inside the cells, the hybrid nanoflowers dissolve and release the Y-DNA probes. Then, the intracellular TK1 mRNA hybridizes with the loop region of Y-DNA, which dissociates the Cy3-labeled loop strand and turns on the red fluorescence. Through the real-time imaging of the intracellular TK1 mRNA, the assessment of tumor cells before and after the treatment of drugs including beta-estradiol and tamoxifen is achieved.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless toxic gas which can be found as HS- in rivers and waste waters especially in the occupational susceptible environment. Herein we synthesized a lophine analogue, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-di(2-pyridyl)imidazole (HPI), which fluoresces at 410 nm after excitation at 280 nm. HPI has an imidazole ring and a pyridine ring which are capable of forming coordinate bonds with copper (Cu(II)) that cause quenching of HPI fluorescence. We found that HS- can selectively liberate HPI from the complex via formation of CuS, thus, HPI regains its fluorescence properties. Interestingly, the probe was proved to be regenerable. This reaction was used for the development of a fluorescence microplate assay for the determination of HS- in environmental samples. The method was applied to river water samples and was able to detect HS- in concentrations down to 5 ppb with acceptable accuracy (90.3-103.0%) and good precision (%RSD <= 4.1). The method showed many advantages over the previously reported ones including instantaneous reaction, simple probe synthesis, high-throughput, high selectivity toward hydrogen sulfide over other ions and sulfur or thiol containing compounds and at last, it complies with the green chemistry rules through using a regenerable probe, aqueous solvents, and miniaturized measurement system.

AB A nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped carbon nanodots (N,S-CNDs) sample was fabricated by an one-step hydrothermal treatment of acid fuchsin. The obtained N,S-CNDs possess yellow fluorescent, excellent water solubility, high fluorescence stability and religious biocompatibility, which can be used as a difunctional and label-free chem-nanosensor for the determination of pH and curcumin (Cur). When the pH is decreased from 8.0 to 4.4, the N,S-CNDs reveals an extraordinary emission escalation at emission wavelength (lambda(em)) of 543 nm, and the pK(a) value of the N,S-CNDs was calculated as 6.06. The N,S-CNDs displays a favourable linear relationship in the physiological pH range of 5.0-7.4, which is meaningful for the research of near-neutral cytosolic pH. Furthermore, the laser scanning confocal microscopic images of intracellular distribution and the determination of pH in HeLa cells were successfully carried out, implying that the N,S-CNDs possess excellent cell membrane permeability and are capable of being further applied to real-time pH fluctuations monitoring in live cells with negligible autofluorescence. More importantly, the fluorescence of N,S-CNDs may be dramatically quenched by Cur via a combination of electrostatic and hydrogen-bond interaction and fluorescence inner filter effect (FIFE). The limit of detection is as low as 81 nmol/L Cur, and the linearity range is 0.5-20 mu mol/L Cur. Ultimately, a satisfactory result was obtained when applying the as-constructed fluorescent chem-nanosensing system for the analyses of Cur in practical samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography is a significant strategy for the separation and enrichment of glycoproteins and glycopeptides. A layered imine-based covalent organic polymer with mesopores (denoted as p-TpBDH) was successfully fabricated by a facile solvothermal method. Then p-TpBDH-OH with abundant hydrophilic groups was evolved from p-TpBDH by the direct reduction. 36 and 40 glycopeptides were identified from IgG digests respectively by p-TpBDH and p-TpBDH-OH. Furthermore, the p-TpBDH-OH exhibits superior selectivity (IgG: BSA = 1: 250) for glycopeptides compared with the p-TpBDH. Encouragingly, a total of 463 glycopeptides assigned to 173 glycoproteins were finally identified from only 2 mu L human serum by the p-TpBDH-OH. Compared with p-TpBDH, abundant hydrophilic and nitrogen-containing affinity sites of p-TpBDH-OH facilitate effective hydrophilic interaction between the polymeric material and glycopeptides. All the results demonstrate the functionalized hydrophilic covalent organic polymer has great potential in large-scale N-glycoproteomic research. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Successive multiple ionic-polymer layers (SMIL) coatings have been often used in capillary electrophoresis due to their simplicity to implement and regenerate. However, the performances of the separation are strongly dependent on the nature of the polyelectrolyte partners used to build the SMIL coating. In this work, we investigate new couples of polyelectrolytes that were not tested before: namely, polybrene (PB), quaternized diethylaminoethyl dextran (DEAEDq) and epsilon-poly(lysine) (epsilon-PLL), as polycations, in combination with poly(acrylic acid), dextran sulfate, poly(styrenesulfonate), poly(methacrylic acid) and poly(L-lysine citramide), as polyanions. Systematic study of intra- and inter-capillaries repeatabilities/reproducibilities was performed based on the determination of migration time, separation efficiency and electroosmotic mobility. Interestingly, the electroosmotic flow was found to vary with the nature of the polycation on a broad range of electroosmotic mobility decreasing in magnitude in the order of PB>epsilon-PLL > DEAEDq, whatever the polyanion associated. Application of the coatings to the separation of proteins is illustrated in a 0.5M acetic acid BGE, including CE-MS separation of ribonuclease B-glycoforms of the same mass (positional or structural isomers).

AB Accurate and facile differentiation of cell types is essential for accurate diagnosis and therapy of diseases. However, it remains challenging due to low specificity, requirement of sophisticated instruments, and tedious operation steps. Herein, a simple, washing-and label-free chemical tongue was constructed for differentiation of cell types. In the array-based sensing platform, DNA-ligand ensembles adsorbed on the surface of MnO2 nanosheets were used as sensing probes. Instead of aptamers from cell-SELEX, the randomly designed DNA strands were used, offering versatile interactions with cells. The property that MnO2 nanosheets can be degraded by intracellular glutathione makes the platform avoid the washing step. Eight types of cell lines were distinguished from each other after the data were treated with principal component analysis (PCA). In addition, a 95% of identification accuracy for the randomly selected unknown samples was achieved. The strategy shows an excellent performance not only in distinguishing cell lines but also in the identification of unknown cell samples. (c) 2019 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, an approach for the detection of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) free-acidity, based on combination of voltammetric profiles (Voltammetry) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) multivariate regression, is described. Voltammetric measurements are performed with a 12.5 mm radius platinum microdisk, directly in the oil samples mixed with 0.5M of the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) tri-hexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, which acted as a supporting electrolyte, and allows achieving a suitable conductivity in the matrices. Multivariate regression is performed directly on full voltammetric responses recorded over a properly chosen negative potential range and scan rate, where essentially all free fatty acids, characterizing EVOOs, can be reproducibly reduced. PLS regression models are built by employing Italian EVOO samples training sets at different acidity levels (over the range 0.2% w/w-1.5% w/w; (% w/w) represents mass percentage) and optimized by choosing the optimal complexity, in terms of number of latent variables (LVs). The free-acidity prediction is made through a multivariate model, constructed by using standards of known acidity (determined by the official volumetric titration method) and validated on an external sample set. To show the validity of the proposed method, the PLS/ Voltammetry predictions of the free-acidity of a series of commercially available Italian EVOOs, ranging from 0.2 to 0.41 % w/w, are obtained and the values compared with those determined by the official titration approach. Differences found between the two methods are within 5% RSD. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, immobilized nanoraspberry-like copper on the reduced graphene oxide (NRCu-rGO) was synthesized and used for modification of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for selective and sensitive simultaneous determination of benzenediols isomers; hydroquinone (HQ), catechol (CC), resorcinol (RS) as well as nitrite (NO2). A detailed investigation such as field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and X-ray diffraction as well as electrochemistry methods such as cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, differential pulse voltammetry (DPVs) and chronoamperometry are performed in order to elucidate the preparation process and properties of the NRCu-rGO/GCE. DPVs peak currents increased linearly with the analytes concentrations within the ranges of 0.13-131.5 mM for HQ, CC, RS and 0.3-131.5 mM for NO2 with a detection limits 49, 52, 60 and 100 nM for HQ, CC, RS and NO2, respectively. The proposed modified electrode was successfully used for simultaneous determination of HQ, CC, RS and NO2 in real samples. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An electrochemical immunoelectrode is fabricated and investigated for quantification of the Procalcitonin (PCT), a protein over expressed in urinary tract infection (UTI). The sensor electrode is prepared by self assembling the conjugate of Zinc sulfide capped Cadmium selenide quantum dots (QD) and PCT specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) over the indium- tin- oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. The presence of QD in the conjugate is found to provide more electroactive surface area and improved electron transfer kinetics and diffusion coefficient to the immunoelectrode. The electrochemical characteristics of this immunoelectrode towards synthetic PCT sample reveal specificity among the pool of various analytes. The sensing characteristics reveal that the sensor can potentially detect PCT over a concentration of 0.21 ng/mL which is above pathological range in healthy person. However, in absence of QD, the detection range lies in between 0.1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL, which is far above the expressed concentration of PCT in UTI. Under optimal conditions, the QD based immunoelectrode exhibited good calibration range from 1 ng/ml to 10 mg/mL. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the development and validation of a fully automated, high-throughput multiclass, multiresidue method for quantitative analysis of 77 veterinary drugs in chicken muscle via direct immersion solid phase microextraction (DI-SPME) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographyelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The selected drugs represent more than 12 different classes of drugs characterized by varying physical and chemical properties. A Hydrophilicelipophilic balance (HLB)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) extraction phase, prepared using HLB particles synthesized in-house, yielded the best extraction/desorption performance among four different SPME extraction phases evaluated in the current work. The developed SPME method was optimized in terms of SPME coating and geometry, desorption solvent, extraction and rinsing conditions, and extraction and desorption times. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the optimal desorption solvent for the proposed application. The developed method was validated according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, taking into account Canadian maximum residue limits (MRLs) and US maximum tolerance levels for veterinary drugs in meat. Method accuracy ranged from 80 to 120% for at least 73 compounds, with relative standard deviation of 1e15%. Inter-day precision ranged from 4 to 15% for 70 compounds. Determination coefficients values were higher than 0.991 for all compounds under study with no significant lack of fit (p > 0.05) at the 5% level. In terms of limits of quantitation, the method was able to meet both Canadian and US regulatory levels for all compounds under study. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel polymeric deep eutectic solvents (PDES) based on 3-acrylamidopropyl trimethylammonium chloride/D-sorbitol functionalized amino-magnetic (Fe3O4-NH2) metal-organic framework (HKUST-1-MOF) composites (Fe3O4-NH2@ HKUST-1@ PDES) were synthesized and characterized by field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and zeta potentials. Then the composites were firstly utilized to selectively separate malachite green (MG) and crystal violet (CV) coupled with magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE). A response surface methodology (RSM) based on Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was selected to analytically optimize the extraction parameters including initial concentration of dyes, extraction time, pH value and extraction temperature. The maximum extraction amount and optimal extraction conditions predicted by the RSM model matched well with the actual experimental results, and the extraction amount was 966.93mg g(-1) for MG and 788.90mg g(-1) for CV, respectively. The results indicated that the model possessed higher calculation accuracy through analyzing fewer sample points, thereby achieving theoretical prediction of extraction amount and conditions and being a prefect supplementary to actual experiments. The electrostatic interaction between the composites and cationic dyes played the main roll in the extraction process. The proposed extraction method exhibited lower limit of detection (98.19 ng mL(-1) for MG and 23.97 ng mL(-1) for CV) and preeminent precision (RSD. 0.4%). Spiked recoveries of fish samples at three spiking levers ranged from 89.43% to 100.65% for MG and 95.29%-98.03% for CV. All results highlighted the excellent potential of Fe3O4-NH2@HKUST-1@PDES-MSPE strategy in selective separation of cationic dyes in complex medium. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The traditional Chinese medicine Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP) was mainly originated from the dried pericarp of Citrus reticulata 'Chachi' (Crc), Citrus reticulata 'Dahongpao' (Crd), Citrus reticulata 'Unshiu' (Cru) and Citrus reticulata 'Tangerina' (Crt) in China. Since these four cultivars have great similarities in morphology, reliable methods to differentiate CRP cultivars have rarely been reported. To discriminate the differences of these CRP cultivars, herein an efficient and reliable method by combining metabolomics, DNA barcoding and electronic nose was first established. The hierarchical three-step filtering metabolomics analysis based on liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) indicated that 9 species-specific chemical markers including 6 flavanone glycosides and 3 polymethoxyflavones could be considered as marker metabolites for discrimination of the geoherb Crc from other cultivars. A total of 19 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were found in nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of CRP, and three stable SNP sites (33, 128 and 174) in the ITS2 region can distinguish the four CRP cultivars. The electronic nose coupled with chemometrics could also be used to effectively distinguish Crc from other CRP cultivars. Therefore, our results indicated that the integrated method will be an effective strategy for discrimination of similar herbal medicines. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) are powerful, complementary techniques for the analysis of environmental toxicants. Currently, most GC-MS instruments employ electron ionization under vacuum, but the concept of coupling GC to atmospheric pressure ionization (API) is attracting revitalized interest. API conditions are inherently compatible with a wide range of ionization techniques as well high carrier gas flows that enable fast GC separations. This study reports on the application of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and a custom-built photoionization (APPI) source for the GC-MS analysis of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a ubiquitous class of flame retardants. Photoionization of PBDEs resulted in the abundant formation of molecular ions M center dot + with very little fragmentation. Some photo-oxidation was observed, which differentiated critical BDE isomers. Formation of protonated molecules [M+H](+) did not occur in GC-APPI because the ionization energy of H2O (clusters) exceeds the energy of the ionizing photons. Avoiding mixed-mode ionization is a major advantage of APPI over APCI, which requires careful control of the source conditions. A fast GC-API-MS method was developed using helium and nitrogen carrier gases that provides good separation of critical isomers (BDE-49/71) and elution of BDE 209 in less than 7min (with He) and 15 min (with N-2). It will be shown that the GC-APPI and GC-APCI methods match the sensitivity and improve upon the selectivity and throughput of established methods for the analysis of PBDEs using standard reference materials (NIST SRM 1944 and SRM 2585) and selected environmental samples.

AB Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimens are recommended for HIV patients to better achieve and maintain plasma viral suppression. Despite adequate plasma viral suppression, HIV persists inside the brain, which is, in part thought to result from poor brain penetration of antiretroviral drugs. In this study, a simple and ultra-sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous determination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir in cell lysates of an immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) was developed and validated. Analytes were separated on a reverse phase C-18 column using water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phases. The analytes were detected using positive electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The assay was linear in the concentration range of 0.1-100 ngmL(-1) for all analytes. Intra-and inter-assay precision and accuracy were within +/- 13.33% and +/- 10.53%, respectively. This approach described herein was used to determine the intracellular accumulation of tenofovir, emtricitabine, dolutegravir simultaneously in hCMEC/D3 cells samples. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The simultaneous detection of multiple analytes from a single sample is a critical tool for the analysis of real world samples. However, this is challenging to accomplish in the field by current electroanalytical techniques, where tuning assay conditions towards a target analyte often results in poor selectivity and sensitivity for other species in the mixture. In this work, an electrochemical paper-based analytical device (ePAD) capable of performing simultaneous electrochemical experiments in different solution conditions on a single sample was developed for the first time. We refer to the system as a Janus-ePAD after the two-faced Greek god because of the ability of the device to perform electrochemistry on the same sample under differing solution conditions at the same time with a single potentiostat. In a JanusePAD, a sample wicks down two channels from a single inlet towards two discreet reagent zones that adjust solution conditions, such as pH, before flow termination in two electrochemical detection zones. These zones feature independent working electrodes and shared reference and counter electrodes, facilitating simultaneous detection of multiple species at each species' optimal solution condition. The device utility and applicability are demonstrated through the simultaneous detection of two biologically relevant species (norepinephrine and serotonin) and a common enzymatic assay product (p-amino-phenol) at two different solution pH conditions. Janus-ePADs show great promise as an inexpensive and broadly applicable platform which can reduce the complexity and/or number of steps required in multiplexed analysis, while also operating under the optimized conditions of each species present in a mixture.

AB A microfluidic system that incorporates both dendrimers and aptamers to detect E. coli O157:H7 is developed. To achieve this, generation 7-polyamidoamine dendrimers were immobilized onto the detection surfaces of PDMS microfluidic channels; subsequently aptamers against E. coli O157: H7 were conjugated onto the microchannel surfaces via the immobilized dendrimers as templates. Surface modifications were characterized by FTIR, XPS, water contact angles, fluorescence microscopy and AFM to confirm the success of each surface modification steps. The efficacy of this simple microchannel in detection was investigated using E. coli O157:H7 spiked samples. Our results showed that this interesting approach significantly increased the amount of aptamers available on the microfluidic channel surfaces to capture E. coli O157:H7 cells to allow sensitive detection, which in turn resulted in detections of E. coli O157:H7 cells at a low limit of detection of 102 cells mL(-1). The results also demonstrated that in comparison with the generation 4-polyamidoamine dendrimers (G4) modified microchannels, those modified with G7 showed enhanced detection signals, improved target capturing efficiencies, and at higher throughput. This simple whole cell detection design has not been reported in the literature and it is an interesting and effective approach to developing a sensitive and rapid detection platform for foodborne pathogenic bacteria.

AB The excellent anticancer effect of combined differential cancer therapies has been observed in the last few decades. Efficient theragnostic nanoparticles (NPs) for malignancy treatment have received considerable research attention and widely investigated today. This study presents our results on the development of aptamer-functionalized Fe3O4@carbon@doxorubicin NPs (Apt-Fe3O4@C@DOX) and their application in the synergetic chemo-photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer. The Apt-Fe3O4@C@DOX NPs displayed high photothermal conversion efficiency and extensive pH/heat-induced drug release. In vitro (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium) bromide experiments indicated that the combined chemo-PTT is much more toxic toward lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) than PTT or chemotherapy alone. In addition, the Apt-Fe3O4@C@DOX NPs demonstrated decreasing contrast enhancement of magnetic resonance (MR) signals, which means they may be potentially applied as a contrast agent and serve as a critical component of T-2-weighted MR imaging of tumor tissues. Taking the results together, the Apt-Fe3O4@C@DOX NPs show great potential for cancer therapy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn, n > 1) influence a variety of important biological functions and activities associated with hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The development of probes for rapid, selective, and sensitive detection of H2Sn still remains a great challenge. Lysosome plays crucial roles in various physiological processes among living cells, which arouse high interest in detecting endogenous lysosome-targetable H2Sn. To the best of our knowledge, there is no lysosome-targetable probe for H2Sn has been reported. In this work, a new lysosome-targetable probe NIPY-NF, based on the scaffold of imidazo [1,5-]pyridine, with a large Stokes shift (215 nm), low detection limit (84 nM), fast response time (6 min) and low cytotoxicity was designed and synthesized. Furthermore, NIPY-NF was successfully applied into the cell imaging for detection of endogenous lysosome-targetable H2Sn. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Controllable fabrication of novel and uniform noble metal nanoparticles on a specific support with a superior catalytic or electrocatalytic performance is of significantly importance for practical applications. In this report, we demonstrated an effective way to fabricate uniform thin-walled Pd/polypyrrole (PPy) hollow nanotubes. The prepared Pd/PPy hybrid nanotubes exhibited an excellent peroxidase-like activity to oxidize a typical peroxidase substrate such as 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine in comparison with traditional Pd/C and Pd black catalysts. The outstanding catalytic activity of the Pd/PPy hybrid nanotubes for peroxidase mimicking could be resulting from their unique hollow characteristic and an interfacial effect between PPy and Pd components. Based on the favorable catalytic property of the Pd/PPy hybrid nanotubes, a convenient and rapid colorimetric way to sensitively determine ascorbic acid has been presented. The detection limit was around 0.062 mu M and an excellent selectivity was also achieved. The developed detection system in this study could be extended to the fields of bioscience and biotechnology with promising prospects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report results of the studies relating to the fabrication of a label-free, flexible, light weight and disposable conducting paper based immunosensing platform comprising of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) and nanostructured iron oxide (nFe(2)O(3)@PEDOT:PSS) nanocomposite for detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a cancer biomarker. The effect of various solvents such as sorbitol, ethanol, propanol, n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the electrical conductivity of Whatman filter paper (WP) modified with nFe(2)O(3)@PEDOT:PSS/WP was investigated. The electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS/WP electrode was found to be enhanced by two orders of magnitude (from 6.8 x 10(-4) to 1.92 x 10(-2) Scm(-1)) after its treatment with DMSO. Further, nFe(2)O(3) doped PEDOT:PSS/WP electrode exhibited the electrical conductivity as 2.4 x 10(-2) Scm(-1). Besides this, the incorporation of iron oxide nanoparticles (nFe(2)O(3)) into PEDOT:PSS/ WP resulted in improved electrochemical performance and signal stability. This nFe(2)O(3)@ PEDOT:PSS/WP based platform was used for immobilization of the anti-carcinoembronic antigen (anti-CEA) protein for quantitative estimation of cancer biomarker (CEA). The results of electrochemical response studies revealed that this conducting paper based immunoelectrode had a sensitivity of 10.2 mu Ang(-1) mLcm(-2) in the physiological range (4-25 ngmL(-1)) and shelf life of 34 days. Further, the proposed immunoelectrode was validated with conventional ELISA for the detection of CEA in serum samples of cancer patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple and effective colorimetric method for the detection of normetanephrine (NMN), an O-methylated metabolite of norepinephrine, using functionalised gold nanoparticles is described. This metabolite is an important biomarker in the diagnosis of adrenal tumours such as pheocromocytoma or paraganglioma. The colorimetric probe consists of spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalised with two different ligands, which specifically recognize different functional groups in normetanephrine. Thus, a benzaldehyde-terminated ligand was used for the recognition of the amino alcohol moiety in NMN, by forming the corresponding oxazolidine. On the other hand, N-acetyl-cysteine was chosen for the recognition of the phenolic hydroxyl group through the formation of hydrogen bonds. The selective double molecular recognition between the probe and the hydroxyl and the amino-alcohol moieties of normetanephrine led to interparticle-crosslinking aggregation resulting in a change in the color of the solution, from red to blue, which could be observed by naked eye. The probe was highly selective towards normetanephrine and no color changes were observed in the presence of other neurotransmitter metabolites such as homovanillic acid (HVA) (dopamine metabolite), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (serotonin metabolite), or other biomolecules present in urine such as glucose (Glc), uric acid (U.A), and urea. Finally, the probe was evaluated in synthetic urine with constituents that mimic human urine, where a limit of detection of 0.5 mu M was achieved. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As an important biomarker, cytochrome c (Cyt c) plays a crucial role in mitochondrial electron transport chain and cell apoptosis. Herein, a label-free near-infrared (NIR) Ag2S quantum dots (QDs)-based fluorescent strategy was constructed for the sensitive and selective detection of Cyt c. In this system, Cyt c was hydrolyzed by trypsin, and the resulting heme-peptide fragment exhibited peroxidase-like activity for catalytic decomposition of H2O2 into hydroxyl radical (.OH). The presence of caffeic acid in this system resulted into the formation of caffeic acid-quinone due to the strong oxidizing ability of .OH. The production of caffeic acid-quinone led to the fluorescence quenching of Ag2S QDs through electron transfer mechanism. Based on the cascade reaction, we successfully developed a label-free approach to detect Cyt c using Ag2S QDs as nanoprobes. Under the optimized conditions, the fluorescence intensity of Ag2S QDs was linearly relative to the concentration of Cyt c over the range from 2.0 to 150 nM with a detection limit of 1.7 nM. In addition, this strategy was successfully applied for quantitative detection of Cyt c in cell lysates of H2O2 or etoposide (anticancer drug)-induced apoptotic cells, providing great potential application for cell-based oxidation pressure determination and screening of anticancer drugs.

AB The development of sensitive and specific analytical methods is critical for the discovery of molecular biomarkers, which assists disease diagnosis and understanding biological processes. Herein, a highly sensitive method is developed using antibody-conjugated plasmonic metal nanoparticles for the detection of targeted biomarkers down to low attomole level via coupling of immunoassay techniques with laser ionization mass spectrometry (LI-MS). The conjugated antibodies target specific antigens, while the metal nanoparticles act as mass tags and ion reservoirs for the signal amplification. With the characteristic localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties, gold (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) undergo explosive ionization upon laser irradiation to generate abundant characteristic mass reporter ions for strong MS signal amplification. With the antibody-conjugated NPs, detection of trace proteins in various biological samples with complex matrix environment, including urine, cell lysates, and animal tissues was demonstrated.

AB This study introduces a signal amplification strategy rely on incorporating a specific polymer film between two typical nanostructured layers, aiming to improve the electrical properties of the platform to be able to transduce small binding event through sub-femtomolar detection of HIV-1 gene at the surface of the constructed biosensing device. The proposed composite was arrayed based on a conductive layer consist of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) sandwiched between the electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) as the sub-layer, and the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as the interfacial layer. We computationally explored that how the use of such design enables the platform to transduce small changes in the interfacial properties of the biosensor, caused by low concentrations of HIV-1 gene, without needing any amplification strategy. Furthermore, it was found that the loin PABA conductive polymer sandwiched between two nanostructure layers play an artwork-ensemble role, which resulted in a good signal repeatability and stability during the relatively long successive incubation and detection procedures. The justification of using such an array of conductive layers was established on the attaining extra low-level of detection limit. The observed performance for probe-DNA immobilized on glassy carbon electrode (GC) modified with ERGO/PABA/AuNPs compared to the GC electrode modified with ERGO/AuNPs inspired us to perform computational calculations, a hybrid of ab-initio and semi-empirical quantum mechanics methods, to discover its probable molecular-scale reasons. A rapid single frequency impedance measurement (SFIM) was also employed to remarkably reduce the measurement time and diminish the probable nonspecific impedance changes. The proposed biosensor was used to evaluate the DNA target over an extremely wide concentration range from 0.1 fM to 10 nM, with a detection limit of 37 aM (S/N = 3). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Composite nanomaterials are particularly useful and offer many excellent opportunities for electro-chemical sensing application. Depending on the high catalytic activity of bimetallic nanoparticles, the large specific surface area, abundant active edges and co-catalytic function of MoS2 nanosheets, we, for the first time, prepared a novel PtNi bimetallic nanoparticles loaded MoS2 nanosheets (PtNi@MoS2) hybrid material by a co-reduction method for the electrochemical sensing application. The nanocomposite is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and then casted on a bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to fabricate an electrochemical sensor (PtNi@MoS2/GCE). The electrochemical investigation showed that the sensor performed good selectivity and wide linear ranges for the simultaneous detection of dopamine (0.5-150 mu M) and uric acid (0.5-600 mu M). And the detection limits were down to 0.1 mu M(S/N = 3) for both analytes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, polyaniline nanospindles have been synthesized using iron oxide as sacrificial template. These nanospindles were utilized for the fabrication of PANI-MoS2 nanoflower architectures via hydrothermal route. The electrostatic interaction between PANI and MoS2 improves the conductivity and provides more direct paths for charge transportation. SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy techniques were employed to explore the crystal structure, and morphological properties of the PANI-MoS2 nanocomposite. Furthermore, an electrochemical biosensing platform based on PANI-MoS2 nanocomposite was fabricated for the specific detection of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique. The binding interactions between the pDNA/PANI-MoS2/ITO bioelectrode and target DNA sequence were also studied. The biosensor exhibits high sensitivity and wide detection range (10(-6) M to 10(-17) M) of target DNA with low detection limit (3-10(-18) M). Additionally, the specificity studies of the genosensor with various target DNA sequences (complementary, noncomplementary and one base mismatch) and real samples analysis of CML shows its potential for clinical diagnostics.

AB In this study, a novel analytical method was developed for online profiling of living rat brain extracellular pH. It involved microdialysis (MD) sampling, introduction of metal ions (e.g., Mn, Co, Ni, Cd) as acid/base indicators, and a pH-dependent solid phase extraction (SPE) based on polymer-metal ion interactions as a sample pretreatment scheme prior to analysis through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). With a 10-mu L microdialysate, optimization of the system provided a working pH range from 5.8 to 8.2 and allowed differentiation of tiny changes in pH, down to a resolution of 0.015 pH units. Standard deviations of measured pH for 6 h of continuous measurement were below 0.05, which was sufficient for evaluating the homeostatic status and the dynamic fluctuations in living rat brain extracellular pH. The method's applicability was verified through measurement of the basal extracellular pH in living rat brains and through monitoring of its changes in response to perfusion of a high-K thorn medium. By applying metal ions as acid/base indicators and coupling a pH-dependent SPE scheme with MD sampling and ICP-MS, this method presents an alternative strategy for reliable online profiling of the living rat brain extracellular pH.

AB Chemical isotope labelling in combination with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (CIL-HPLC-MS/MS) is a powerful method for quantitative profiling of targeted molecules. In the current work, we successfully developed a novel CIL-HPLC-MS/MS method for quantitative profiling of residual organophosphorus thioester pesticides (OPTPs) in agricultural products through the determination of the cleavage products of thiol (CP-thiol) compounds. In this method, we synthesized a novel pair of CIL reagents, i. e., N-(4-(carbazole-9-yl)-phenyl)-N-maleimide (NCPM-d(0)) and its deuterated analogue NCPM-d(2), both of which contain a maleimide moiety as the reactive group and an isotope tag to sensitively label CP-thiol compounds. NCPM-d(0) was used to label CP-thiol compounds cleaved from OPTPs in the investigated agricultural product samples, and NCPM-d(2) was used to label CP-thiol compounds cleaved from OPTPs in the standard substance-spiked organic agricultural product samples. The heavily labelled derivatives were used as the internal standards (ISs) to compensate for the matrix effects during MS analysis. The NCPM-d(0)-and NCPM-d(2)-labelled derivatives generated two characteristic product ions (PIs) at m/z 372.5 and 374.5 under collision induced dissociation, respectively, which are used to establish the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode-based detection. The precursor ions of NCPM-d(0) and NCPM-d(2) labelled derivatives of CP-thiol compounds were deduced according to the structures of the OPTPs. The peak pairs with a fixed mass difference and similar retention times were assigned as potential CP-thiol candidates for the identification of the corresponding OPTPs. Using the proposed method, we successfully determined seven residual OPTPs in agricultural product samples. Taken together, the presented method was demonstrated to be a promising new technique in the quantitation of OPTPs in agricultural product samples with high reliability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB In recent years, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) became more and more popular in industrial and consumer electronics applications. Unevenly distributed liquid crystals (LC) and the presence of organic contaminations in the LC layer, for example from the display sealant, can cause display defects and therefore lower the display quality. This work describes the development of a fast and easy screening method for display samples by laser ablation coupled to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (LA-APCI-MS). With this ambient technique, LC components as well as sealant materials, which are one of the main sources for display contaminations, can be detected simultaneously using spatial resolutions down to 100 mu m. Minimal sample preparation is needed for this method and exact masses can be acquired by using an Orbitrap mass analyzer. By LA-APCI-MS, nineteen different LCs and five different sealant materials were detected as pure substances as well as on commercially available LCDs. In addition, a principle component analysis (PCA) was used to differentiate between LCs and sealant ions in the complex data matrix. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a self-discretization and zero-water-loss microfluidic digital PCR (dPCR) device to enable low-cost and robust quantitative nucleic acid assays. In this device, a thin void is integrated beneath the reaction chamber array. By utilizing the permeability of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, the integrated void serves a dual function: vacuum "accumulator" and hydration "reservoir". The combination of pre-stored pumping energy and water compensation for evaporation loss enables simple, robust and reliable single-DNA-molecule amplification and detection in 10,000 reactors of picoliter volume. Compared to the conventional degassing PDMS pumps, the vacuum accumulator exhibits superior performance due to more vacuum storage and shorter diffusion distance. We also evaluated the performance of the embedded hydration layer in suppressing evaporation loss at elevated temperatures, and verified that zero-water-loss could be achieved for all reaction chambers in our dPCR chip during thermal cycling. By performing quantitative detection of T790M DNA from 10 to 10(4) copies/mL, the proposed dPCR chip demonstrated high accuracy and excellent performance for the absolute quantification of the target gene with a dynamic range of 10(4). The simplicity and robustness of our dPCR chip make it well suited for low-cost molecular diagnostic assays under resource-limited settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the development of two microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs), one well-based and the other based on a lateral flow assay (LFA) configuration, to detect glucose via a colorimetric assay using the solid metal-organic framework (MOF) Zr-PCN-222(Fe), to encapsulate glucose oxidase (GOx). The well-based platform consisted of laminate sheets and multiple layers of waxprinted chromatography paper. Solutions of KI and glucose placed into the well flowed through the device and reacted with the GOx@MOF species sandwiched between the paper layers realizing a yellow-brown color. The LFA platform consisted of chromatography paper between parafilm and polyvinyl acetate (PVA) layers. GOx@MOFs spotted on the paper subjected to solutions of KI and glucose yielded a brown color. The devices were then dried, scanned, and analyzed yielding a correlation between average inverse yellow intensity and glucose concentrations. The development of these devices employing MOFs as biomimetic catalysts should further expand the applications of microfluidic technologies for sensors a variety of analytes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ratiometric sensing suffers from less interference and can obtain more accurate results than single-signal assay. Here, a new ratiometric optical sensing strategy for H2O2 detection is developed by etching silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to deactivate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and reduce Rayleigh scattering based on a hyphenated technique of fluorescence and second-order Rayleigh scattering (SRS). The ratiometric detection of H2O2 is achieved through exploiting a hybrid system fabricated by fluorescent carbon dots and silver nanoparticles (CDs/AgNPs). In the CDs/AgNPs system, the fluorescence of CDs is quenched because of FRET, and the scattering is strong due to the intrinsic high light-scattering power of AgNPs. With the introduction of H2O2, the AgNPs are etched and the CDs are released from the AgNP surface, resulting in the fluorescence enhancement and scattering decline. As a result, ratiometric sensing of H2O2 can be achieved based on the CDs/AgNPs system by simultaneous collection of fluorescence and SRS signals. The sensing system is further used for H2O2-generation bioanalysis, and as a proof-of-concept, ratiometric assay of glucose and evaluation of glucose oxidase activity are performed successfully. This work provides a new perspective for sensing applications of plasmonic nanoparticles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here we report an electrochemical DNA (E-DNA) sensor to detect a variety of analytes by using a novel interfacial probe that rationally integrates triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) into a tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN). In the presence of analyte, the blocked TFO is released and subsequently binds the edge of TDN to form a triplex DNA structure, which confines the redox reporter to be in close proximity to the underlying electrode and enhances the electrochemical signal. Thanks to the unique design and property of the probe, the proposed sensor could efficiently suppress the background signal (from 0.69 mu A to 0.092 mu A) and thus enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in improved sensing performance. Furthermore, the sensor displays new merits such as rapid response (similar to 35 min), one-step operation, easy regeneration (buffer change) and good generality (changing recognition element) compared with traditional TDN-based E-DNA sensor using enzyme displays signal transducer. In addition, to demonstrate real-world applicability of this new sensor, we have successfully detected different analytes (e.g., DNA, protein, and metal ion) in the complex media (e.g., serum, blood, and lake water), implying its considerable potential for precise bioanalysis in the future.

AB Carboxylic acids have been efficiently used to activate H2O2 to form even more potent oxidant-peroxy acids through enzyme-catalyzed processes. By employing acetic acid as the activator, herein we report for the first time that cofactor-free DNA displays unexpected activity in H2O2-mediated oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) under mild conditions. A series of 10-nt oligonucleotides were rationally designed with various combinations of double nucleotides including TG, AG, CG, TA and AC respectively, which demonstrates that the catalytic performance of DNA is highly dependent upon the sequence composition, strand length and continuous nucleotides. Inspired by phosphate-induced inhibition effects on the formation of peracetic acid, an ultrasensitive assay was well-established for monitoring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on the basis of double terminal-phosphorylated G-rich oligonucleotides. Phosphorylated DNA not only serves as the substrate for ALP-catalyzed hydrolysis, but also acts as the enzyme-like catalyst for signal amplification. Quantitative determination of ALP is realized in a linear range from 0.05 to 15 mU/mL, resulting in the limit of detection of 0.01 mU/mL. The rapid and reliable test also has great potential in analyzing serum samples for practical disease diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS) are diagnosed by detection of autoantibodies against Ro and La protein autoantigens, respectively. In this work, the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases SLE and SS was demonstrated using thermophoresis of Escherichia coli with the autodisplayed autoantigens. Ro and La protein autoantigens were autodisplayed by constitutive expression together with a fluorescent protein called tdTomato in the cytosol. The binding affinity of the autodisplayed autoantigens was tested against positive and control sera by using FACS as a reference method. The factors influencing interactions between E. coli with autodisplayed autoantigens and autoantibodies in sera during thermophoresis were analyzed by measurement of cell surface charge and size before and after interaction. Finally, the thermophoretic diagnosis of autoimmune diseases SLE and SS was demonstrated using sera from patients afflicted with the respective diseases by estimating sensitivity and selectivity from ROC plots.

AB Owing to the pivotal function in post transcriptional gene modification, miRNA biomarkers are playing crucial role in tracking and diagnosing various forms of tumors in a short time period. Hence, the need to develop simple, sensitive and specific detection of miRNAs for precise diagnosis arises. This current study is aimed to develop a detecting platform by combining rolling circle amplification with AuNps-based lateral flow strip (LFS-RCA) for simultaneous detection of miRNA 21 and miRNA let-7a. The current methodology is simple, sensitive, specific and selective for miRNA let-7a and miRNA 21 with the limits of detection (LOD) as low as 20 pM and 40 pM, respectively. In this technique, rolling circle amplification is playing an essential role in increasing sensitivity and reducing experimental cost. Moreover, the padlock probe with high specificity can immediately identify the simultaneous amplification of multiple miRNAs targets, which may contribute in saving sample volume and detection time. Hopefully, in future with further development, this developed technique can be chosen as a potential tool for detection of miRNAs in clinical diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed a rapid and sensitive universal peptide-based time-resolved luminescence assay for detection of enzymatic post-translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs play essential roles in intracellular signaling and cell regulation, thus providing functional protein diversity in cell. Due this, impaired PTM patterns have been linked to multiple disease states. Clear link between PTMs and pathological conditions have also driven assay development further, but still today most of the methodologies are based on single-specificity or group-specific PTM-recognition. We have previously introduced leuzine-zipper based peptide-break technology as a viable option for universal PTM detection. Here, we introduce peptide-break technology utilizing single-label homogeneous quenching resonance energy transfer (QRET) and charge-based peptide-peptide interaction. We demonstrate the functionality of the new assay concept in phosphorylation, deacetylation, and citrullination. In a comparable study between previously introduced leucine-zipper and the novel charge-based approach, we found equal PTM detection performance and sensitivity, but the peptide design for new targets is simplified with the charged peptides. The new concept allows the use of short <20 amino acid peptides without limitations rising from the leucine-zipper coiled-coil structure. Introduced methodology enables wash-free PTM detection in a 384-well plate format, using low nanomolar enzyme concentrations. Potentially, the peptide-break technique using charged peptides may be applicable for natural peptide sequences directly obtained from the target protein. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Simple, inexpensive, and rapid diagnostic tests in low-resource settings with limited laboratory equipment and technical expertise are instrumental in reducing morbidity and mortality from epidemic infectious diseases. We developed a smartphone-based fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) platform for the highly sensitive point-of-care detection of Zika virus nonstructural protein 1 (ZIKV NS1). An attachment was designed and 3D-printed to integrate the smartphone with external optical and electrical components, enabling the miniaturization of the instrument and reduction in cost and complexity. Quantum dot microspheres were utilized as probes in fluorescent LFIA because of their extremely bright fluorescence signal. This approach can achieve quantitative point-of-care detection of ZIKV NS1 within 20 min. Limits of detection (LODs) in buffer and serum were 0.045 and 0.15 ng mL(-1), respectively. Despite the high structural similarity, a high-level Dengue virus NS1 as interferent showed limited cross-reactivity. Furthermore, this assay was successfully applied to detecte ZIKV NS1 and virions spiked in complex biological samples, indicating its practical application capability. Given its low cost, compact size, and excellent analytical performance, the proposed smartphone-based fluorescent LFIA platform holds considerable potential in rapid and accurate point-of-care detection of ZIKV NS1 and provides new insight into the design and application of molecular diagnostic methods in low-resource settings.

AB Ionic liquids with their unique properties found so far numerous analytical applications. Among them ionic liquids immobilized on the surface or within the pores of a solid support were successfully utilized in extraction techniques dedicated to preconcentration of the analytes from food, environmental and biological samples. In this review we focus on comprehensive summarizing of available literature data on the examples of ionic liquid-based hybrid materials implementation in selected analytical extraction techniques, namely solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, hollow-fiber solid-phase microextraction, stir-bar sorptive extraction and biosensors. Additionally, this work is supported by concise discussion on strategies of ionic liquids immobilization in order to form hybrid materials (both chemical and physical) and the effects of confinement on structures along with ionic liquids physicochemical properties. This work allows for identifying the opportunities, challenges and shortcomings of this powerful and convenient, yet still not fully discovered analytical approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The exploitation of desired materials with specific properties for water remediation has become an irresistible trend. Generally, materials favorable to the elimination of hazardous contaminants are always beneficial to the detection of these compounds. Nevertheless, few researches combined these two procedures into a treating line. Therefore, a Prussian blue nanoparticles-doped graphene oxide (PBGO) composite was successfully synthesized and prepared as a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coating for pollutant detection and a three-dimensional (3D) aerogel for contaminant removal in this study. Owing to its highly conjugated structure, abundant oxygen sites and periodical cyano groups, the composite achieved satisfactory enrichment capacity towards specific pollutants. The combination of elimination and determination of organic contaminants by using the PBGO composite not only possessed satisfactory performance but also avoided the separation process and secondary pollution. Finally, the PBGO SPME coating was utilized for the sensitive detection of several hazardous contaminants in environmental water samples with satisfactory recoveries. We think the combination of a PBGO composite with the green sample pretreatment technique (SPME) and pollutant elimination will not only help to facilitate the improvement in analytical fields, but also provide a secondary pollution-free way to explore the adsorption properties of adsorptive materials for environmental contaminants.

AB The extensive use of pesticides promotes environmental contamination, mainly in surface and ground waters. However, they remain at very low concentration and present wide degradation level requiring the use of efficient devices for pesticides passive sampling. In this study, a new in situ passive sampling device was developed for monitoring and estimating time-weighted average (TWA) of pesticides in waters. The device was made with simple, recyclable and cheap materials. The sampling system involves the liquid phase microextraction technique with hollow fiber in two-phases mode. Pesticides determination was done by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The method was optimized and validated for the determination of 29 pesticides in water, showing good linearity in the range between 0.012 and 40.00 mu g L-1 with determination coefficients of R-2 > 0,9649. Limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.009 to 0.557 mu g L-1 and limit of quantification (LOQ) from 0.012 to 0.802 mu g L-1. The recoveries of spiked pesticides in water samples were in the range from 96 to 130%. The method was applied to forty environmental water samples collected at Sao Francisco river basin, Brazil. The highest detection frequency was found for the pesticides 4,4-DDE, 4,4-DDD and propazine. They were detected in more than 20 percent of the samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microcystins (MCs), which are produced by eruptive cyanobacteria, seriously threaten the health of humans for their poisonousness. Herein, a facile strategy was introduced to synthesize the magnetic gamma-cyclodextrin polymer (Fe3O4@PDA@gamma-CDP) composite and set it as a novel adsorbent with excellent properties for the magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) of MCs. The prepared Fe3O4@PDA@gamma-CDP microspheres exhibit good aqueous dispersibility and highly affinity for MCs, thus contribute to an excellent extraction performance for trace MCs in water samples. Combined with HPLC-MS/MS, a handy, sensitive and efficient method was developed for detection of MCs in water samples, which shows good linearity (R-2 >= 0.9992) in the range of 1.0-1000 pg mL(-1), low limits of detection (0.8-2.0 pg mL(-1), S/N = 3), satisfactory repeatability with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 6.2% (n = 5). At last, the proposed method was successfully applied for the extraction and detection of MCs in fresh water and sea water samples, which provides great potential of trace-level MCs determination in lake and sea water.

AB A novel ionic liquid (IL) modified magnetic nanocomposite (mag-MoS2-RGO), which was composed of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), was firstly synthesized and characterized (mag-MoS2-RGO-IL). Compared with mag-MoS2-RGO, the mag-MoS2-RGO-IL exhibited the higher adsorption capacity of 143.9 mg/g for methylene blue (MB) under optimum conditions. Experimental results were imitated by adsorption isotherms and kinetic models, revealing a monolayer adsorption on the homogeneous surface governed by chemisorption. The removal rate was maintained 78% after 5 cycles of regeneration, indicating its good reutilization. Methodological study suggested that the method possessed excellent repeatability, precision and stability. The recoveries from the real samples were in the range of 87.0-98.8% with relative standard deviation of <= 5.2%. Benefiting from composite structure and magnetic Fe3O4, the stable magnetic adsorbent can be quickly separated from aqueous solution. All of above proves that the prepared mag-MoS2-RGO-IL has great application potential in dye separation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new, relatively simple sample processing and detection workflow has been developed for the quantification and confirmation of banned growth-promoting substances in a wide variety of animal-based food products. The method covers all required compounds (belonging to the so-called A1, A3, A4 and B2f groups as termed by the relevant EU legislation) which are currently monitored by the official European community surveillance programs. The sample processing includes a thermal sample denaturation step, intended to prevent undesirable side-reactions during the following enzymatic deconjugation of covalently bound analytes. A pH-adjusted dual liquid/liquid-extraction produces sufficient clean extracts for a wide range of matrices (urine, muscle, liver, serum, full blood). The method has been validated using two hybrid quadrupole high-resolution mass spectrometers (Orbitrap and time-of-flight technology-based instruments). Full-scan data acquisition, interlaced with targeted modes (unit mass isolation of the precursors, followed by collision-induced fragmentation), produces sufficiently sensitive and selective detection of the analytes within all the validated matrices. The proposed method is an alternative to currently used methods that are restricted to a limited set of analytes and matrices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quinones are key reactive electrophilic intermediates that are formed in abundance during wine oxidation and have a significant impact on wine character, altering color and flavor. They readily react with nucleophiles, such as SO2 and glutathione. Some nucleophiles have been reported to react with quinones in model wines, but many of the corresponding products have not been confirmed in real wines. Here, a stable isotope labeling approach employing C-13(6) labeled ortho-quinone was evaluated in combination with an exact-mass list of putative products. The measurements were taken using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Fourteen compounds were detected based on a match in the table plus an M+6 mass isotope pattern derived from the labeled quinone mixture. The presence of the mass label also establishes reaction pathways for the formation of these compounds, and suggests how wine catechols could react during wine oxidation, demonstrating the insight provided by this analytical technique.

AB Estrogens regulate many diverse biological processes in health and disease. They circulate at a wide range of concentrations in females generating several active metabolites (hydroxy and methoxyestrogens). The metabolites are assumed to be present in much lower levels and are thought to contribute to diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Estrogen metabolites are challenging to quantify in plasma and currently available immunoassays are non-specific. Here we have developed and validated a novel assay to simultaneously quantify parent estrogens and their metabolites by mass spectrometry (MS).
   Estrogens were extracted from human plasma using solid phase extraction and derivatized using 1-(5-fluoro-2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-4-methylpiperazine (PPZ) before quaternization by methylation ("MPPZ"). MPPZ derivatives were separated and quantified by liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) in positive electrospray ionization mode, using a QTrap 6500 + coupled to a Shimadzu Nexera X2. Separation was achieved using an ACE Excel 2 C18-PFP column (2 mm, 2.1 mm x 150 mm). The limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.43-2.17 pg on column with a linear range from 2 or 10 - 2000 pg mL(-1). Intra and inter-day precision and accuracy were acceptable (< 20% at LOQ and < 15% above). These derivatives demonstrated minimal degradation upon short-term storage at 15 degrees C (< 20%) and longer term at -20 degrees C (< 20%). Using this approach, estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) were detected in plasma (0.5 mL) from healthy women and those with PAH but downstream metabolites 16-hydroxy-E1, 16-hydroxy-E2, 2-methoxy-E1 and 4-methoxy-E1 were only detected in plasma from diseased patients. These findings will next be tested robustly in large patient cohorts.
   This novel LC-MS/MS analysis of estrogens and their bioactive metabolites, using MPPZ derivatization, opens doors for the simultaneous analysis of a panel of estrogens in human plasma, across the endogenous range of concentrations encountered in health and disease.

AB The precise quantification of mercury (Hg) stable isotope compositions in low concentration or dilute samples poses analytical challenges due to Hg mass limitations. Common Hg pre-concentration procedures require extended processing times, making rapid Hg stable isotope measurements challenging. Here we present a modified pre-concentration method that combines commonly used Hg reduction and gold trap amalgamation followed by semi-rapid thermal desorption (less than 1 h) and chemical trapping. This custom designed system was demonstrated to perform adequately on multiple trapping matrices including a new bromine monochloride (BrCl) wet oxidant trap (40% 3HNO(3):BrCl), capable of trapping consistently in 2 mL volume over a wide range of Hg masses (5-200 ng). The procedure was also shown to work effectively on natural matrices, waters and sediments, producing comparable isotope results to the direct digestion analyses. Here, we present a method that can effectively triple sample throughput in comparison to traditional procedures, and also access lower concentration matrices without compromising the accuracy or precision of Hg isotope measurements.

AB Organochlorines are highly persistent and toxic contaminants that are widely distributed and accumulated in various aquatic or soil environments as well as food chains. Heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of such pollutants by using semiconductor nanoparticles has been recognized as one of the effective purification ways. Understanding of degradation mechanisms and designing of highly efficient semiconductor nanoparticles require structural identification of various degradation intermediates that are difficult to achieve with current spectroscopic techniques. Herein a mass spectrometric approach was developed to tackle interfacial photoelectron transfer and hydroxyl radical abstraction on different semiconductor nanoparticles. Chlorobenzenes (including hexachlorobenzene and chlorothalonil) adsorbed on the surfaces of nanoparticles were found to instantly undergo dechlorination and ring dissociation through photoelectron capture dissociation and abstraction of a chlorine atom from aromatic C-Cl bond by hydroxyl radicals. Different intermediates have been unambiguously identified with experimental evidences provided by a Q-TOF mass spectrometer. It has been demonstrated that both electron density around atoms and steric effects of side chains contribute to the site selectivity for photoelectron capture and hydroxyl radical abstraction. But the energies needed for chemical bond cleavages and the stabilization of acquired charges play important roles in degradation efficiency. By using mass spectrometric imaging, photocatalytic differences of different semiconductor nanoparticles have been revealed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biological therapeutics are established as major contributors to the pharmaceutical pipeline. Many of these biological drugs are lyophilized to preserve their conformation and reduce decomposition during storage and shipping. Therefore, understanding and controlling the effects of lyophilization on protein higher order structure is critical for commercialization of biologics. Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a well-established technique for studying protein higher order structure. Previous publications have demonstrated a solid state HDX (ssHDX) method for labeling formulated, lyophilized proteins to assess their physical stability during, but this process still suffered from low throughput and undesired back exchange. Recently, our group described a method combining HDX-MS with MALDI to greatly reduce the time of analysis and nearly eliminate H/D back-exchange, but that method was not suited for interrogating solid samples. This work integrates the two techniques to assess and predict the stability of peptides and proteins following mixing and lyophilization with various excipient formulations. Sample mixing and handling were performed through the use of a bench-top robotics and programmed data MALDI-MS acquisition allowed for monitoring deuterium incorporation for dried peptides and protein samples following continuous labeling with D2O vapor. Effects of excipients upon peptide stability were also tracked and compared to a control for a three day labeling time course. This workflow is automated and free from back-exchange. As demonstrated by deuterium retention of bradykinin, these features serve to reduce experimental error normally associated with conventional deuterium exchange experiments. The proposed union of MALDI-MS and ssHDX can be applied to study higher order structure of proteins and peptides and the effects of added excipients in an environment that closely resembles the storage and shipping conditions of biopharmaceuticals and may be beneficial in giving insights studying protein structural dynamics in solids.

AB Luminescence lifetime detection plays an important role in time-resolved detection and research. However, the traditional instruments always require expensive detectors such as time-correlated single photon counter or streak camera. Herein, a low-cost and miniaturized apparatus for measuring upconversion luminescence lifetimes was developed by using a smartphone equipped with a 980 nm CW laser and a motor. When the motor was driving the sample circling at a high linear velocity, the excited sample would emit a luminescence arc, which could be photographed by the phone camera. The rotating rate could be measured by a tuner APP and then used for transferring arc length to delay times. By analyzing the grayscale distribution of the luminescence arc, the luminescence decay curve was obtained, which was then used for exponential fit and calculating lifetimes. The images captured by different smartphones revealed similar lifetime values, suggesting a wide universality of this method. The whole system was not only remarkably cheaper but also more miniaturized than traditional instruments for measuring luminescence lifetimes, indicating the promising applications in point of care testing for time-resolved luminescence detection for bioanalysis and disease diagnosis.

AB Recently, mimic enzymes have obtained particular interest by their high activity, stability, and biocompatibility. In this work, by coupling copper hydroxide nanozyme and G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme to form a double-integrated mimic enzyme, a visual, sensitive and selective immunosensor was established to detect microcystin-LR (MC-LR). In this immunoassay, the microplates were modified with core-shell silica/nickel silicate as the substrate to capture MC-LR antigens. Then, Cu(OH)(2) nanocages with fine regulation were used as the label to capture the secondary antibody for immunoreaction and the DNA primer for propagation, followed by using hybridization chain reaction to amplify the DNA primer, thus numerous DNAzymes (G-quadruplex/hemin) can be formed on the surface of Cu(OH)(2) nanocages with the aid of hemin. Such double-integrated mimic enzyme including Cu(OH)(2) nanozymes and DNAzymes showed excellent peroxidase activity for the chromogenic reaction of 2,20-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline- 6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), which realized the visual detection of MC-LR in the range from 0.007 to 75 mu g/L with the detection limit of 6 ng/mL, and thus provided the probability for the portable assessment of MC-LR in real sample.

AB In this study, a coumarin-semirhodamine hybrid based dual-channel fluorescent probe was developed for detection of peroxynitrite. This probe works well in nearly pure aqueous solution and displays a rapid, highly sensitive and selective response for peroxynitrite at two different emission wavelengths (700 and 515 nm, respectively), along with distinct color and green to near-infrared fluorescence changes. The fluorescent intensity ratio at 700 and 515 nm increases linearly with the concentration of peroxynitrite from 0 to 50 mu M, and the detection limit is estimated to be 59 nM. Moreover, bioimaging of exogenous and endogenous peroxynitrite in living cells and in vivo detection of peroxynitrite with this probe at dual fluorescence channels were all successfully applied. The results suggest that this new probe can be used as a useful imaging tool for studying peroxynitrite in vitro and in vivo. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we were synthesized fluorescent carbon quantum dots via facile one-step hydrothermal treatment of mustard seeds (M-CQDs). It showed excellent optical property with fluorescent quantum yield 4.6%. The as-prepared M-CQDs exhibited peroxidase-like mimetic activity and catalyzed the oxidation of chromogenic substrate 3,3', 5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2 to produce a blue color reaction mixture with the prominent peak at 652 nm. Furthermore, the peroxidase-like catalytic performance of M-CQDs followed the steady-state kinetics behavior and exhibited similar catalytic activity as that of natural enzyme Horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In addition to this, the double reciprocal plot showed a parallel line which suggested the occurrence of Ping-Pong type of mechanism. The H2O2 dependent oxidation of TMB was helpful for the colorimetric detection of H2O2 in the linear range of 0.02-0.20 mM with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.015 mM. Interestingly, the oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) was further reduced to native TMB by the reducing agent ascorbic acid. Hence M-CQDs showed its potential towards the selective and sensitive detection of ascorbic acid in the linear range of 10-70 mu M having a correlation coefficient of 0.998 with LOD of 3.26 mu M. The practical feasibility of the proposed detection method of AA was also investigated in common fresh fruits. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Salmonella is a leading source of bacterial foodborne illness in humans, causing gastroenteritis outbreaks with bacteraemia occurrences that can lead to clinical complications and death. Eggs, poultry and pig products are considered as the main carriers of the pathogenic Salmonella for humans. To prevent this relevant zoonosis, key changes in food safety regulations were undertaken to improve controls in the food production chain. Despite these measures, large outbreaks of salmonellosis were reported worldwide in the last decade. Thus, new strategies for Salmonella detection are a priority for both, food safety and public health authorities. Such detection systems should provide significant reduction in diagnostic time (hours) compared to the currently available methods (days). Herein, we report on the discovery and characterization of nucleic acid probes for the sensitive and specific detection of live Salmonella within less than 8 h of incubation. We are the first to postulate the nuclease activity derived from Salmonella as biomarker of infection and its utility to develop innovative detection strategies. Our results have shown the screening and identification of two oligonucleotide sequences (substrates) as the most promising probes for detecting Salmonella - Sal-3 and Sal-5. The detection limits for both probes were determined with the reference Salmonella Typhimurium (STM 1) and Salmonella Enteritidis (SE 1) cultures. Sal-3 has reported LOD values around 10(5) CFU mL(-1) for STM 1 and 10(4) CFU mL(-1) for SE 1, while Sal-5 proves to be a slightly better probe, with LODs of 10(4) CFU mL(-1) for STM 1 and 10(4) CFU mL(-1) for SE 1. Both selected probes have shown the capability to recognize 49 out of 51 different Salmonella serotypes tested in vitro and the most frequent serotypes in porcine mesenteric lymph nodes as a standard sample used in fattening-pig salmonellosis baseline studies. Notably, our results showed 100% correlation between nuclease detection and the PCR-InvA or ISO-6579 standard method, underlining the great potential of this innovative nucleic acids technology to be implemented as a rapid method for food safety testing.

AB A simple and label-free fluorescence turn-on method is proposed for the discrimination and detection of epinephrine (Ep) and dopamine (DA) via polyethyleneimine (PEI)-initiated in situ copolymerization and excitation wavelength switch. The PEI solution in the presence of Ep, DA and the mixture of Ep and DA are denoted as PEp-PEI, PDA-PEI and MEp+DA, respectively. In this study, PEI aqueous solution medium initiates the auto-oxidization of Ep and DA and the bioinspired copolymerization. These resultant copolymers emit yellow-green fluorescence color with a fluorescence emission maximum at 515 nm. Interestingly, these fluorescent copolymers exhibit distinct different excitation spectra, although Ep and DA are structurally very similar. PDA-PEI exhibits only one excitation peak at 385 nm, and PEp-PEI shows dual-excitation mode with two significant excitation peaks at 328 nm and 405 nm, respectively. MEp+DA also shows dual-excitation mode with two excitation peaks at 330 nm and 395 nm, respectively. Thus, individual Ep, DA, and their mixture can be discriminated based on the different excitation spectral shapes and peak locations of PEp-PEI, PDA-PEI and MEp+DA. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of Ep and DA in mixture can also be achieved by switching excitation wavelength between 330 and 395 nm and monitoring the fluorescence emission intensity of MEp+DA at 515 nm. The fluorescence intensity of MEp+DA only related to the concentration of Ep when excited at 330 nm. Moreover, the concentration of DA can also be calculated by subtracting the fluorescence intensity of PEp-PEI from the total fluorescence intensity when excited at 395 nm. The resultant method has been used to simultaneously detect Ep and DA in human urine samples. The proposed fluorescence system is facile, eco-friendly, low-cost, and time-saving, and also provides a new and simple path for discriminating analogues. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A three-dimensional (3D) magnetic porous N-Co@carbon dodecahedron/hierarchical carbon framework (3D N-Co@C/HCF) hybrid has been successfully synthesized by integration of the ZIF-67 into HCF and then calcination under an inert gas (N-2). 3D N-Co@C/HCF as magnetic sorbent show good extraction ability for phthalate esters (PAEs: dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), diethyl phthalate (DEP)). This is attributed not only to the abundant adsorption sites (due to the presence of large specific surface area) and the extremely strong p-conjugated system of 3D N-Co@C/HCF, but also to sufficient contact spaces and facile transport channels (ascribe to the interconnected hierarchical 3D porous structure) between targets and the material. Furthermore, 3D N-Co@C/HCF possesses excellent magnetism and structure stability for maximizing reuse of sorbent, which is applied as sorbent for disperse magnetic solid-phase extraction (d-MSPE) of five PAEs in the real samples. Under optimized condition, a facile d-MSPE coupled to HPLC-UV detection was developed for the extraction and determination of trace PAEs in real samples. This method revealed a high enhancement factor (230-281), wide linear range (0.2-100 ng mL(-1)), lower the limits of detection (0.023-0.113 ng mL(-1)) and satisfactory recoveries (87.1-107.2%) with the relative standard deviation (RSD) (n = 5) less than 6% for the determination of PAEs in real samples.

AB A thorough understanding of particle formation and polymer growth during emulsion polymerization is indispensable for the development of particles and products with very specific properties. This has created a demand for the detailed characterization of various properties and property distributions - and the relation between these. A method is described that enables comprehensive, simultaneous determination of the size distribution of nanoparticles and the molecular-weight distribution of the constituting polymers as a function of the particle size. The result is a complete two-dimensional distribution that details the interdependence of the two parameters. The approach comprehensively combines hydrodynamic chromatography with size-exclusion chromatography. An automated band-roadening filter has been developed to improve the accuracy of the measured distributions. The algorithm utilizes automated curve-fitting approaches to describe detected particle distributions for each horizontal slice of the 2D-LC chromatogram, and filters band broadening using calibration curves. The method has been applied to samples of complex nanoparticles comprising hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged moieties, viz. stabilized dispersions of poly[(methyl methacrylate)-co-(butyl acrylate)-co-(methacrylic acid)]-nanoparticles in water. We consistently found that, within a single population of particles, the weight-average molecular weight increases with particle size. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microencapsulation of living cells is a field that has been heavily investigated by many researchers over the past two decades. Numerous experimental setups have been developed to encapsulate living cells in microbeads using different microfluidic devices and materials. Previous studies have investigated different microfluidic devices and materials for use in cancer treatment, drug delivery, environmental remediation, food production, and cell culture contexts. Some of the current challenges to these setups are maintaining reasonable levels of cell viability, cell leaching, nutrient and oxygen diffusion, and ensuring uniform microbead shape and size distribution. Addressing these issues and identifying the most reproducible and convenient setup enables researchers to efficiently encapsulate living cells and further advance the biomedical field. The efficiency of microencapsulation in terms of cell viability and uniform microbead shape and size distribution are directly related to the type of device used and the cross-linking method applied. Hence, the focus of this review is to assess the effects of using T-junction, flow-focusing, and co-flow microfluidic devices as well as thermal, ionic, and photo cross-linking methods for the microencapsulation of living cells. Recent applications of bacteria microencapsulation using microfluidic systems since 2017 are presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have been phased out, there is a plethora of per-or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) generated and only a small number of these compounds are currently being monitored in environmental and biological sample using molecular mass spectrometry (MS). Total fluorine determination has revealed that a substantial amount of fluorinated organic compounds has not been identified. Due to the small mass deficiency of fluorine, it is not an easy task to screen successfully all fluorinated compounds including those which are not easy ionisable, hence a novel fluorine-specific detector is needed. Here, inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) was used for the first time for the detection of PFAS, by using the novel approach to transfer F- into a detectable [BaF](+) in the argon plasma. A reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and then online coupled to ICPMS/MS for the fluorine-specific detection and simultaneously to electrospray MS (ESI-MS) to separate perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). The calibration was linear and was element-specific with detection limits of 0.49mg F L-1 under gradient elution method. As a proof of concept, PFCA standards in methanol were not fully neutralised to force the esterification and those solutions were measured using HPLC-ICPMS/MS-ESI-MS. The methyl esters were not detectable by ESIMS but by ICPMS/MS. This illustrates that the undetectable fluorine-containing compounds were detected and quantified by the element-specific detection of ICPMS/MS. The analysis of spiked river water at sub-ppb level gave an acceptable recovery using a SPE-based preconcentration method. Since ICPMS/MS method is an element-specific detection, all non-fluorinated compounds interfering in ESI-MS were eliminated. Hence, HPLC-ICPMS/MS can be used as a non-targeted method of fluorinated compounds which helps the identification of novel fluorinated compounds in environmental and biological samples and helps with mining the ESI-MS data.

ID ALTERNATING LEAST-SQUARES; DATA FUSION; DIARYLETHENE
AB We propose a multivariate curve resolution approach for the investigation of photochromic systems using UV-Visible spectroscopy. The incorporation of photochemical hard-models as constraints in multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) allows extracting reaction quantum yields in situations where a complete knowledge of the system is not available. We apply this approach to the study of the photochromism of CMTE (cis-1,2-dicyano-1,2-bis(2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thienyl) ethene) under continuous monochromatic irradiation. The mechanism, involving 3 species and 2 reversible reactions, is written and translated into a kinetic constraint that can be applied to the concentration profiles within ALS. First, ambiguity of the solution obtained for photochemical model(s) is calculated and discussed for single set analysis. Multiset analysis is then proposed combining data obtained under different irradiation wavelengths to provide more reliable results. Finally, the photochemical reactivity of CMTE is widely unraveled, and some description of the mechanism observed under irradiation at 365 nm is given. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) utilizing zwitterion-modified material as solid phase has attracted extensive attention for selective enrichment of glycopeptides. However, a tedious synthesis and low specificity for glycopeptides have restricted its application. Herein, a facile and effective approach was developed to synthesize a zwitterionic (ZIC) polymer-coated magnetic composites (denoted as Fe3O4@PMSA) with a zwitterion ((2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl)-dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide, MSA) via one-step distillation-precipitation polymerization (DPP). The well-designed composites presented clearly ZIC-polymer shell and superior hydrophilicity (water contact angle 30.2), and the performance for selective enrichment of glycopeptides were investigated with standard and real samples, respectively. Owning to the abundant of ZIC molecules with multi-charge and polar groups on the surface of resulting polymer coating, the Fe3O4@PMSA demonstrated high selectivity for glycopeptides enrichment with IgG digest (twenty glycopeptides identified, S/N >= 20) and a mixture of IgG and BSA at the mass ratio of 1:230 (sixteen glycopeptides identified, S/N >= 20). Besides, the detection limit as low as 0.67 fmol for IgG (S/N >= 10) and satisfied recovery yield more than 74% were achieved by the proposed sorbents. Finally, the Fe3O4@PMSA was applied for enriching N-linked glycopeptides from human serum, and 348 unique N-glycosylation sites and 419 glycopeptides from 158 glycoproteins were strictly identified from 1 mL human serum. The results demonstrated that the proposed Fe3O4@PMSA showed a promising potential in glycoproteomics analysis of real biological samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A sensitive spectrophotometric method for the determination of dissolved titanium (Ti) in seawater is developed. It involves in-line preconcentration and a long path length liquid waveguide capillary cell (LWCC). Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin is used to preconcentrate Ti from similar to 25 mL seawater sample at pH 1.7, and elution is accomplished with 0.8 mol L-1 hydrochloride acid. The eluted Ti solution is buffered to pH 6.0 with 1.0 mol L-1 ammonium acetate and mixed with 1.5 mmol L-1 Tiron solution. The mixture is then injected into LWCC and measured by spectrophotometry at 420 nm. Before the preconcentration step, the sample is treated with 7 mmol L-1 ascorbic acid to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II), in order to eliminate the Fe interference. The method is not interfered by Fe(III) and Cu(II) present in seawater samples at concentrations 50-fold higher in relation to Ti, and by Cd(II), Pb(II), Cr(VI), Mn(II), Al(III), Zn(II), and Ni(II) at concentrations 100-fold higher in relation to Ti. It is time efficient (7.5 minutes per sample), sensitive (0.10 nmol L-1 detection limit), precise (1.40% measurement RSD at 1.00 nmol L-1 Ti) and is characterized by a linear range of 0.50-5.00 nmol L-1 Ti. The method was applied to analysis of natural water samples collected from the Jiulongjiang Estuary, Fujian, China. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biodegradable polymeric materials may eventually replace biostable materials for medical applications, including therapeutic devices, scaffolds for tissue engineering, and drug-delivery vehicles. To further develop such materials, a more fundamental understanding is necessary to correlate parameters including chemical-composition distribution within a macromolecular structure with the final properties of the material, including particle-size. A wide variety of analytical techniques have been applied for the characterization of polymer materials, including hyphenated techniques such as comprehensive twodimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC). In this context, we have investigated enzymatic degradation of polyester-based nanoparticles, both in-solution and by the use of an immobilized-enzyme reactor (IMER). We have demonstrated for the first time the implementation of such an IMER in a size-exclusion chromatography system for on-line degradation and subsequent analysis of the polymer degradation products. The effect of residence times ranging from 12 s to 4 min on polymer degradation was assessed. IMER-assisted degradation is much faster compared to in-solution degradation, which requires several hours to days, and opens the possibility to use such reactors in LC x LC modulation interfaces.

AB Aptamers represent interesting bioreceptor alternatives to antibodies when developing a bioassay and are selected by the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) process. After selection, an extensive characterization process is essential to verify the binding affinity and specificity of aptamer candidates, which is the most time-consuming and costly step. In this study, we assessed a new microfluidic platform, namely Evalution (TM), as a rapid and high throughput aptamer characterization platform. To do this, we first selected aptamers against influenza A nucleoprotein (infA NP) by performing magnetic bead-based SELEX. The selected aptamer candidates were subsequently screened using Evalution T for their binding kinetics and specificity towards infA NP. All aptamers showed dissociation constants (K-D) in the low nanomolar range (from 13 to 41 nM), and differential binding behavior towards control proteins, such as BSA and influenza B nucleoprotein (infB NP). Among 5 selected candidates, one aptamer (NP5) exhibited a significant discrimination between infA NP and infB NP and was further used to benchmark the kinetic analysis of Evalution (TM) (K-D = 41 nM) with an SPR platform (K-D = 17 nM). These results suggested that NP5 has the potential to be used for developing sensitive and infA NP specific aptamer-based assay. Moreover, the presented platform proved to be an efficient aptamer characterization tool for performing typical aptamer characterization experiments like binding kinetics (due to the real-time monitoring feature) and specificity assessment in a highthroughput manner due to the multiplexing capacity.

AB Hydrogen sulfide as a gas indicator molecule plays an important role in various human physiological processes. However, due to the high volatility and diffusivity of H2S in biological systems, it is very difficult to implement a precise assay for H2S detection. Compared with the destructive instrumental methods, assays based on fluorescence probes provide noninvasive and real-time detections of H2S in living cells. In this work, we presented a fluorescent nanoprobe based on dye-functionalized Au nanorods (NRs)@silica for sensitive and selective detection of H2S in vitro and living cells. With the metal enhanced fluorescence effect, the fluorescence turn-on and turn-off were controlled by the formation and disassembly of coordination compound between dyes and copper ions. Silica matrix was used to coat the Au NRs to prevent them from the biological cytotoxicity. The effects of the different distances between Au NRs and fluorophores on fluorescent enhancement were explored and approximately 5-fold fluorescence enhancement was obtained with a distance of 22 nm. A detection of limit of 17 nM was achieved. In addition, visualization of exogenous and endogenous H2S in living cells was validated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As pyrophosphate ion (PPi) and pyrophosphatase (PPase) play crucial roles in the pathological process of arthritis, determination of PPi and PPase in biological fluids turns to be of great importance for clinical diagnosis and therapy of arthritic diseases. In this work, we proposed a new fluorescent assay for PPi and PPase activity detection based on the competitive coordination chemistry of Fe3+ between PPi and an in situ formed fluorescent polydopamine (PDA). FeCo layered double hydroxide (FeCo-LDH) was explored as a peroxidase mimic to facilitate the in situ formation of fluorescent PDA from dopamine mediated by low-concentration H2O2 within 30 min; The formed fluorescent PDA could be significantly quenched by Fe3+ through forming a PDA-Fe3+ complex structure; When PPi existed, it coordinated Fe3+ competitively against PDA and inhibited the fluorescence quenching of PDA by Fe3+; When PPi was hydrolyzed under the catalysis of PPase, the Fe3+ ion could quench the fluorescence of the formed PDA again. With these principles, our fluorescent assay was able to detect PPi and PPase activity specifically, providing detection limits down to 54 mM and 0.13 U/L, respectively. Furthermore, accurate determination of PPi and PPase activity in spiked human serum was also demonstrated using the developed assay. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a labile molecule that exists in four different forms: active, latent, cleaved and target bound form. Although there have been many methods to measure the total PAI-1, the measurement of active form of PAI-1 antigen is still challenging. Here we developed a novel ELISA to detect the active form of PAI-1 based on a highly specific PAI-1 capturing agent which binds to active PAI-1 with high affinity. We also used a highly stable PAI-1 mutant as an assay calibrator to enhance the method's reproducibility. This ELISA has the advantage of measuring both the antigen level and activity of PAI-1 at the same time. The assay had a sensitivity of 0.167 ng/ml and aworking range of 0.195-25 ng/ml. The intraand inter-assay variations were 6.7% and 11.3% respectively. The mean recovery of spiked standard was 102%. We used this strategy to measure the active PAI-1 level in plasma of healthy donors, and had an interesting observation: the PAI-1 level reduced by half after plasma storage for 6 h at room temperature. This finding represents the first observation of activity loss in plasma PAI-1 samples, and may explain large variations in PAI-1 levels (0-100 ng/ml) observed in human samples using commercial assays.

AB A rapid, label-free, and multifunctional fluorescent probe for simultaneous detection of multiple targets was fabricated based on G-quadruplexes and DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (AgNCs). In this work, a probe with two capitated recognized regions was coupled with a locked G-quadruplex at the 5'-terminus and dark AgNC at the 3'-terminus. Upon the addition of the virus subtype H5N1 gene or microRNA-141, only the sequence of the G-quadruplex was released and bound with Thioflavin T (ThT) for a specific fluorescent response. On the contrary, with the presence of the influenza virus subtype H1N1 gene or microRNA-21, the fluorescence intensity was enhanced because of two split AgNCs approaching closely to produce a nanocluster dimer. Subsequently, with multiple target addition, fluorescence signals were produced for both G-quadruplexes and AgNCs. Moreover, this single and duplex detection for virus DNAs and microRNAs, which provides a versatile platform for different targets, was sufficiently sensitive for the expected detection limit, and still possessed unique selectivity with similar oligonucleotides. The simultaneous detection of targets in biological fluids indicated that there is great opportunity for this strategy to be further applied in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis.

AB Ideal methods for miRNA detection should be rapid and amplification-free in the mix-and-measure format. Here we report a novel FRET strategy based on fluorescence-enhanced p19 proteins-conjugated single quantum dot (QD) with multiplex antenna for one-step, specific and sensitive miRNAs quantitative analysis. It is simple in design and operation, and possesses high sensitivity and selectivity. In the strategy, RNA-binding viral p19 proteins-conjugated quantum dot (p19-QD) with high fluorescence and multiplex antenna was designed, and exploited for the capture recognition element and the donor. In the presence of target miRNAs, the p19-QD would tightly capture the miRNA-21-antimiRNA-21 duplex (dsRNA) formed in solution by hybridization of the specific antimiRNA-21-Cy3 probe (receptor) to the single-stranded miRNA-21 target. The FRET detection system between QD and Cy3 was constructed, and the signal read-out was measured. Conversely, in the absence of target miRNA-21, the p19-QD refuse to capture the free single-stranded antimiRNA-21-Cy3 probe (receptor), the FRET between quantum dot and Cy3 is deterred, thereby providing a low-background signal to improve sensitivity. Benefiting from the high affinity and specificity of p19 protein for duplex RNA and the fluorescence enhancement of donor p19-QD by the passivation and protection from p19 protein, a detection limit as low as 0.6 fM was achieved without employing any amplification techniques and pre-concentration or purification steps. The performance can be achieved by only one-step incubation without additional reagents and washing steps, thus greatly reducing the operating difficulty and saving time. Moreover, the fluorescence-enhanced p19-QD conjugate-based FRET strategy avoids the specific design in the number of the bases for interval in the DNA-QD conjugate-based FRET system using DNA strands as the FRET linker, and improves the FRET efficiency. Furthermore, it has been successfully applied to analyze the content of miRNA-21 in breast cancer cell. The results indicated that, the strategy will become a sensitive and reliable miRNAs quantification method in biomedical research and early clinical diagnostics. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Telomerase is an important biomarker for cancer diagnosis and a valuable target for cancer therapy. Most of the reported telomerase assays suffer from the repeating thermal cycles, laborious protocols, expensive instruments and the limited sensitivity. To solve these issues, we develop a new telomerase assay based on telomerization-driven release of fluorescent 2-aminopurine. We designed a 2-aminopurine molecular beacon in which the fluorescence of 2-aminopurine is quenched due to stacking interaction effect without the use of extra quenchers. The presence of target telomerase can open the 2-aminopurine molecular beacon, triggering a quadratic signal amplification reaction to digest abundant 2-aminopurine molecular beacons, releasing large amounts of free 2-aminopurine molecules with strong fluorescence emission. Due to the inherent low background signal of 2-aminopurine molecular beacon and the highly efficient telomerization-driven quadratic signal amplification, this method exhibits high sensitivity with a limit of detection equivalent to 1 human lung cancer A549 cell and a large dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude from 1 to 10000 cells. Moreover, this method can be further applied for telomerase inhibition assay and the discrimination of cancer cells from normal cells, holding great potential in telomerase-related clinical diagnosis and drug discovery.

AB Despite that microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs) provide effective analytical platforms for point-of-care diagnosis in resource-limited areas, it remains challenging to achieve simple and low-cost fabrication of mu PADs. A novel method for fabrication of mu PADs is developed in this study using a folded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated paper mask with a specific pattern to form a sandwich structure with inserted chromatographic paper. PDMS penetrates the target paper from the front and the back sides, and then is cured in the target paper to form legible channels. This method for prototyping mu PADs has many favorable merits including simple operation without the need of trained personnel, fast fabrication and low cost. We further investigated colorimetric detection of melamine in the mu PADs, and it showed a remarkable measurement with a detection limit of 0.1 ppm in aqueous solutions and liquid milk discriminated by the naked eye, which meets the detection limit required by USA and China. The fabricating strategy developed in this study is very promising and attractive for the development of simple mu PADs for point-of-care applications, including diagnostic testing, food safety control and environmental monitoring.

AB The development of biosensors that are portable, low-cost, and quantitative has long been sought for rapid, on-site, and timely detection of avian influenza virus (AIV). In this study, an antibody-based Raman lateral flow immunoassay strip was developed to detect AIV H7N9. This LFIA strip used a novel core-shell structure material, AuAg4-ATP@AgNPs, as a Raman probe. An antibody specific for AIV and goat anti-mouse IgG antibody were immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane as the test and control lines, respectively. Accumulation of antibody-virus-antibody-Raman probe complex at the test line could be visualized by the naked eye, and the Raman signal could be quantified using a portable Raman instrument. The testing process for the SERS-based LFIA strips could be completed in 20 min, which avoided the time-cost of current methods for AIV analysis. In our SERS-based biosensor, we estimated the limit of detection (LOD) for H7N9 to be 0.0018 HAU. This value is approximately three orders of magnitude more sensitive than the corresponding HA assays. When testing real sample, the results of the strip test were in accordance with those from real-time PCR testing. In conclusion, the SERS-based LFIA strip proposed in this study shows tremendous potential to detect targets quickly and sensitively using an elegantly simple method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A S-nitrosothiol (RSNO) is used for highly selective and sensitive copper ion sensing for the first time. Cu(II) in the sample is reduced to Cu(I) by a low amount of thiols generated from hydrolysis of RSNO molecules or added thiols such as L-glutathione or L-cysteine. Cu(I) is able to trigger cleavage of the S-NO bond, which converts colored RSNOs to colorless products. The dark green S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicill-amine is used as an exemplary RSNO in this report. In the spectrophotometric test, the detection limit toward Cu(II) is 0.23 mu M without added thiol reductants, and 0.08 and 0.06 mu M in the presence of L-glutathione and L-cysteine, respectively. Furthermore, we prepared fully inkjet printed paper-based sensors by deposition of all reaction reagents and buffers on the same piece of cellulose paper. A smartphone equipped with a color analysis app enables quantification of the color change of the paper-based Cu(II) sensors. In this method, a detection limit of 1.2 mu M and a linear range of 0-10 mu M were obtained. Finally, we successfully applied this instrumentation-free and reagent-free senor for Cu(II) analysis in real drinking water and river water samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amphotericin B (AmB) is still, despite its severe nephrotoxicity, the first-line agent in the management of serious systemic fungal infections. A sensitive and reliable method is therefore required to control AmB concentration in body fluids of a patient. This study demonstrates the potential of the off-line combination of preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF) with capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) or capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) in the determination of AmB in human blood serum. The required value of the isoelectric point of AmB was determined to be 6.1 using the CIEF technique. Preparative IEF served as a pre-separation and concentration technique. The pH gradient was traced by colored low molecular pI markers. The collected fraction with AmB was easily processed and then analyzed by CIEF and CZE. Tens of picograms of AmB in human blood serum sample can be determined by a combination of preparative IEF with CZE. The method was linear in the AmB concentration range of 0.3-600 ng mL(-1). The recovery ranged from 93% to 98%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Qualitative and quantitative determination of fatty acids in plasma is of extreme importance as these are indicators of metabolic diseases. In this work, a sensitive and rugged method for detecting and quantifying fatty acids (as fatty acid methyl ester derivatives, FAMEs) in blood plasma was developed. The use of large-volume injection (LVI) gas chromatography-vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy (GC-VUV) for analysis of fatty acids in blood plasma allowed the injection of higher sample volumes to accommodate sufficient analyte on-column for necessary detection ranges with a run time of 45 min. Calibration curves exhibited consistent linearity and reproducibility and were used along with internal standards for the quantification of 11 saturated and 21 unsaturated fatty acids. Intra-day and inter-day (n = 6) CVs had an average of 5 and 6%, respectively, and recoveries an average of 105%. The concentrations of EPA, DHA, and AA, as well as the omega-3 index and omega-6/omega-3 ratio, were calculated and compared with clinically actionable measurement ranges. Due to the use of LVI, the more volatile analyte (C8:0) was lost and therefore impossible to quantify. The volatility cutoff was determined to be the C10:0 analyte with a molecular weight of 186.295 g/mol. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An analytical methodology based on asymmetric flow field flow fractionation (AF4) hyphenated to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has been developed to study gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in cell culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, DMEM, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, FBS, and antibiotics) used for in vitro toxicological studies. AF4-ICP-MS separation of AuNPs was performed using a regenerated cellulose membrane (molecular weight cut-off, MWCO, of 10 kDa). The carrier composition and the AF4 separation program were optimized. Under the optimum conditions, AuNPs of different types, i.e. phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and citrate stabilized, and sizes (10, 30 and 40 nm), without and with cell culture medium could be separated. The developed method allowed to detect transformations in AuNPs and dissolved gold species (Au3+) induced by this medium, such as an increase in the hydrodynamic volume and oxidation. Centrifugal ultrafiltration (CU), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Ultraviol-tevisible (UV-vis) absorption spectrophotometry have been used as complementary techniques to study these processes. This information is of major interest to have a correct interpretation of the in vitro toxicological studies of NPs, which are more and more demanded due to the increasing concerns about the safe use of these materials and their impacts. This work demonstrates the potential of hyphenated techniques based on AF4 to achieve this relevant information. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Absolute molar mass determination in mixed solvents. 1. Solving for the
   SEC/MALS/DRI "trivial" case

AB Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with on-line static light scattering, specifically multi-angle static light scattering (MALS), and differential refractometry (DRI) detection remains the premier method by which to determine absolute, calibrant-independent molar masses of polymers. The method is restricted to the use of either neat solvents or solvents with a small amount of additive. In mixed solvents, preferential solvation (i.e., the enrichment, within the solvated volume of the polymer in solution, of one solvent over the other as compared to the solvent ratio outside said volume) leads to errors in the areas of the MALS and DRI chromatograms, as the solvent baseline does not accurately represent the solvent contribution to these detectors' peaks. A seemingly trivial way by which to overcome this problem is through the use of an isorefractive solvent pair. This "trivial" solution is complicated by the fact that the solvents in the pair must be miscible with each other in all proportions; the individual solvents as well as the mix must be able to fully dissolve the analyte; the solvents must possess sufficient optical contrast with the solution so as to generate an adequate detector signal; the solvent mix must be compatible with the chromatographic stationary phase, such that enthalpic contributions to the separation are minimal and analyte recovery from the columns is quantitative; and the difference in the Rayleigh factors of the solvents can be ignored. Herein, we present the analysis of narrow dispersity polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) samples, across a four-fold range in molar mass, using SEC/MALS/DRI in a mix of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and methyl isoamyl ketone (MIAK), solvents which are shown to be isorefractive with each other at the temperature and wavelength of the experiments. Molar mass averages and dispersities are demonstrated to be statistically independent of solvent composition and to correspond well to the values in neat THF. The experiments were augmented by the use of on- and off-line quasi-elastic light scattering and of off-line MALS and DRI, to study the effect of solvent composition on polymer size in solution and on dilute solution thermodynamics. Additionally, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to study the effect of tacticity on the insolubility of PMMA100 in 100% MIAK. We believe this constitutes the first example of obtaining accurate molar masses of polymers by SEC/MALS/DRI employing mixed solvents. The value of these experiments to other forms of macromolecular liquid chromatographic separations is also noted. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Interactions of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with live cells are known to exert a great impact on their functions, including cell signalling, genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic processes. Modern analytical techniques applied to studying nanoparticle-cell interactions are to improve our understanding of the mode of action of AuNPs, which is essential for their approval in disease therapeutics. Such methods may vary depending on what step of particle internalization is in question, i.e., cellular uptake, intracellular transport (accompanying by changes in the chemical state), translocation to different cell compartments, interaction with relevant subcellular structures and localization. This review focuses on the implementation and critical assessment of advanced analytical methodologies to investigate the cellular processing of AuNPs. Also addressed is a sought-after issue of accounting in in-vitro studies for a chemical form in which the AuNPs enter the cell in vivo. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemical (EC) detection techniques in flow-based analytical systems such as flow injection analysis (FIA), capillary electrophoresis (CE), and liquid chromatography (LC) have attracted continuous interest over the last three decades, leading to significant advances in EC detection of a wide range of analytes in the liquid phase. In this context, the unique advantages of pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) in terms of high sensitivity and selectivity, and electrode cleaning through the application of pulsed potential for noble metal electrodes (e.g. Au, Pt), have established PAD as an important detection technique for a variety of electrochemically active compounds. PAD is especially valuable for analytes not detectable by ultraviolet (UV) photometric detection, such as organic aliphatic compounds and carbohydrates, especially when used with miniaturised capillary and chip-based separation methods. These applications have been accomplished through advances in PAD potential waveform design, as well as through the incorporation of nanomaterials (NMs) employed as microelectrodes in PAD. PAD allows online pulsed potential cleaning and coupling with capillary or standard separation techniques. The NMs are largely employed in microelectrodes to speed up mass and electron transfer between electrode surfaces and to perform as reactants in EC analysis. These advances in PAD have improved the sensitive and selective EC detection of analytes, especially in biological samples with complex sample matrices, and detection of electro-inactive compounds such as aliphatic organic compounds (i.e., formic acid, acetic acid, maleic acids, and beta-cyclodextrin complexes). This review addresses the fundamentals of PAD, the role of pulsed sequences in AD, the utilisation of different EC detectors for PAD, technological advancements in PAD waveforms, utilisation of microelectrodes in PAD techniques, advances in the use of NMs in PAD, the applications of PAD, and prospects for EC detection, with emphasis on PAD in flow-based systems.

AB Hyperspectral imaging is a way to explore the spatial and spectral information of the different compounds in chemical or biological samples. In addition, multivariate curve resolution - alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) can be used to extract this information based on the bilinearity assumption. However, it is well-known that using proper constraints can reduce the amount of uncertainty in the results of MCR, which is called rotational ambiguity. In MCR-ALS analysis of hyperspectral images, different image processing techniques, such as model fitting, image segmentation or sparse image recovery can be applied as spatial constraints. In this contribution, we aim to investigate how the use of these spatial constraints limits the extent of rotational ambiguity of MCR-ALS solutions. For this purpose, we evaluate the extent of rotational ambiguity and use Borgen plots to visualize it. We show on simulations and real hyperspectral imaging data that accuracy of the results is improved when spatial constraints are applied. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last four decades, there has been a pursuit for a non-invasive solution for glucose measurement, but there is not yet any viable product released. Of the many sensor modalities tried, the combination of electrical and optical measurement is among the most promising for continuous measurements. Although non-invasive prediction of exact glucose levels may seem futile, prediction of their trends may be useful for certain applications. Hypoglycemia is the most serious of the acute complications in type-1 diabetes highlighting the need for a reliable alarm, but little is known about the performance of this technology in predicting hypoglycemic glucose levels and associated trends. We aimed to assess such performance on the way to develop a multisensor system for detection of hypoglycemia, based on near-infrared (NIR), bioimpedance and skin temperature measurements taken during hypoglycemic and euglycemic glucose clamps in 20 subjects with type-1 diabetes. Performance of blood glucose prediction was assessed by global partial least squares and neural network regression models using repeated double cross-validation. Best trend prediction was obtained by including all measurements in a neural network model. Prediction of glucose level was inaccurate for threshold-based detection of hypoglycemia, but the trend predictions may provide useful information in a multisensor system. Comparing NIR and bioimpedance measurements, NIR seems to be the main predictor of blood glucose while bioimpedance may act as correction for individual confounding properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A new split-type photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensing platform was designed for sensitive detection of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) in foodstuffs, coupling with enzymatic hydrolysate-triggered etching reaction of cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) on cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles-functionalized interface. Initially, the photosensitive electrode was prepared by coating CoOOH nanosheets on the surface of CdS nanoparticles to quench the photocurrent. Thereafter, a competitive- type enzyme immunoreaction was carried out on monoclonal anti-AFB(1) antibody-conjugated magnetic bead by using alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-labeled bovine serum albumin-AFB(1) (AFB(1)-BSA) conjugate as the competitor. With the formation of immunocomplex, the carried ALP hydrolyzed ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) into ascorbic acid (AA) and phosphate. The former ascorbic acid produced etched or dissolved CoOOH nanosheets into Co2+ ions, thus resulting in the exposure of CdS nanoparticles on the surface to enhance the photocurrent of the modified electrode. Under optimum conditions, the photocurrent decreased linearly with the increasing AFB(1) concentration in the dynamic range of 0.01-10 ng mL(-1), and the limit of detection was 2.6 pg mL(-1). The precision of this method (expressed as RSD) was +/- 8.6%. In addition, the accuracy was monitored by analyzing spiked food samples, and gave the well-matched results with the referenced ELISA method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The geochemical fate of indium in natural waters is still poorly understood, while recent studies have pointed out a growing input of this trivalent element in the environment as a result of its utilisation in the manufacturing of high-technology products. Reliable and easy-handling analytical tools for indium speciation analysis are, then, required. In this work, we report the possibility of measuring the total and free indium concentrations in solution using two complementary electroanalytical techniques, SCP (Stripping chronopotentiometry) and AGNES (Absence of Gradients and Nernstian Equilibrium Stripping) implemented with the TMF/RDE (Thin Mercury Film/Rotating Disk Electrode). Nanomolar limits of detection, i.e. 0.5 nM for SCP and 0.1 nM for AGNES, were obtained for both techniques in the experimental conditions used in this work and can be further improved enduring longer experiment times. We also verified that AGNES was able (i) to provide robust speciation data with the known In-oxalate systems and (ii) to elaborate indium binding isotherms in presence of humic acids extending over 4 decades of free indium concentrations.
   The development of electroanalytical techniques for indium speciation opens up new routes for using indium as a potential tracer for biogeochemical processes of trivalent elements in aquifers, e.g. metal binding to colloidal phases, adsorption onto (bio) surfaces, etc. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) method using a new high-capacity cerium oxide (CeO2) binding gel, for the first time, was developed for measuring dissolved inorganic arsenic in freshwater and seawater. The capacities of the new CeO2 binding gel were 682 mu g and 375 mu g for As-III and As-V, respectively. The masses of As-III and As-V accumulated by CeO2-DGT device increased linearly with time and agreed well with the theoretical value calculated by DGT equation. The arsenic accumulation by CeO2-DGT was independent of pH (4.05-9.04) and ionic strength (0.1-750 mM), and common anions including CO32-, SO42-, Cl- and PO43- had no obvious interference. CeO2-DGT showed excellent long-term deployment performance in freshwater and synthetic seawater. Field trials with CeO2-DGT achieved successfully the time-weighted-average concentrations of total inorganic arsenic in reservoir water (1.38 +/- 0.09 mu g/L) and coastal seawater (0.45 +/- 0.06 mu g/L). The results were comparable to those measured by grab sampling. The proposed method was reliable and robust for in-situ measurements of dissolved inorganic arsenic in environmental waters.

AB A methamphetamine-based molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) has been prepared by bulk polymerization to recognize new psychoactive substances (NPS) of the amphetamine, cathinones and 2C families in oral fluid samples, being the first precedent of a synthetized MIP for the extraction and preconcentration 32 NPS including amphetamine type substances and synthetic cathinones from oral fluids. Pre-polymerization complex and resulting materials were appropriately characterized by infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. Appropriateness of the material for the specific recognition of the target analytes was also evaluated through computational calculations and experimentally assessed by solid phase extraction (SPE). The most appropriate SPE conditions were evaluated and recoveries of 32 different NPS were obtained, ranging from 80 to 120% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) in all cases lower than 12%. Amphetamine-related NPS were analyzed by a fast and portable methodology based on ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and a rearguard procedure based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) providing limit of detection values from 10 to 80 mu g L-1 and from 0.03 to 1.3 mu g L-1, respectively. Oral fluid samples, containing different interferents like caffeine, fluticasone and cetirizine, were spiked with 300 mu g L-1 amphetamine and subsequently analyzed, showing recoveries ranging from 81 to 115% using both methodologies. Thus, this paper shows preliminary results to demonstrate the applicability of the developed procedure which could be used with minor modifications as screening technique in on-road drug analysis.

AB Urine and hair are used for assessing human exposure to toxicants. Urine tests can show acute toxicant exposure. Hair analysis can be used to determine chronic toxicant exposure after months to years; however, compared to urine, hair analysis in exposure assessments is much less frequently investigated. Urine and hair are different matrices, and their mechanisms of toxicant metabolite incorporation are different. The toxicant metabolites present in urine and hair may also be different. To clarify this issue, a procedure was developed to identify toxicant metabolites in rat samples using a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic data processing method. Di-(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP), an industrial plasticizer, was used as the model toxicant. The developed procedure identified not only known DPHP metabolites (mono-(propyl-6-oxo-heptyl) phthalate, mono-(propyl-6-hydroxyheptyl) phthalate, and mono-(propyl-6-carboxyhexyl) phthalate) but also novel metabolites that were structurally related to DPHP in the rat samples, indicating that the developed procedure successfully identified toxicant metabolites in in vivosamples. Among the 62 tentative metabolites identified from the 7th-day urine and the 28th-day hair samples, 33 were detected in only the urine samples, 19 were detected in only the hair samples, and 10 were identified in both the urine and hair samples. A total of 15 out of the 62 metabolites were confirmed as DPHP structure-related metabolites based on MS/MS analysis. Among the 15 DPHP structure-related metabolites, only 2 metabolites were present in both the urine and hair samples. These results suggested that the metabolites identified in urine could not be applied to exposure assessments based on hair analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ion shutter is one of the key components of the drift-tube types of ion mobility spectrometer, which affects both the resolving power and sensitivity of an ion mobility spectrometer. In this work, a spatiotemporal model was built to understand the behaviors of the ion swarms around the ion shutter. For simplicity, a Tyndall-Powell gate (TPG) was chosen as the gating disturbance to the field on the two sides of ion shutter could be separated. It can be inferred from the spatiotemporal model that the ion swarm could be diluted in front of the TPG when the gate closing voltage (GCV) was superposed on the grid facing the ionization region, while it could be compressed behind the TPG when the GCV was superposed on the other grid. These inferences conformed to the narrower and higher ion peaks obtained at GCV superposed on the latter grid and were further verified by the ion distribution profiles obtained at a wide gate opening pulse width. Finally, the product of the resolving power and the gating efficiency was proposed to evaluate the gating performance of an ion shutter. At GCV superposed on the grid facing the drift region, the best gating performance of 42 was obtained with peak height of 1.63 nA and resolving power of 57.2, and was almost twice as high as the optimal gating performance at GCV superposed on the other grid.

AB A smartphone-assisted microfluidic chemistry analyzer using an image-based colorimetric detection method was successfully developed for the simultaneous analysis of three diabetes-and hyperlipidemia-related indexes, glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC). A fan-shaped microfluidic chip was designed and optimized to reliably allocate a premixed serum sample into four reaction chambers by a simple pipetting. The color changes of the peroxidase-H2O2 enzymatic reactions in the chambers were captured and analyzed using a smartphone-controlled analyzer with a LED light source and a CCD camera. The highly quantitative relationships between the analyte concentrations and the color characteristic values of the green channel of the captured images were successfully established, enabling accurate and reproducible detections of GLU, TG, and TC simultaneously at a low cost. The parallel analyses of 111 serum samples using our system and a conventional chemistry analyzer were conducted, yielding an excellent correlation and consistency between these two systems. This study proved the feasibility of performing the multi-index monitoring of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and other chronic diseases on a point-of-care platform at a high fidelity, but a low cost.

AB Traditionally, a resistive pulse sensor (also known as Coulter counter) works by letting a particle pass through a small orifice in an electrolyte solution. The detection sensitivity mainly relies on the volume ratio of the particle to the orifice. This paper presents a novel resistive pulse sensor which has a sensing orifice located on the side wall of a microchannel. In this way, the sensor can detect and count particles (or cells) without requiring particles (or cells) passing through the sensing gate. An equation was derived to relate the magnitudes of the detected signals and the electrical resistances. Results show that the magnitudes of the detected signals can be increased by applying voltages from more than one voltage input channels simultaneously. Under the same conditions, the magnitudes of the detected signals become larger when the diameters of particles are larger. Higher detection sensitivity can be obtained simply by increasing either the magnitudes of the applied voltages or the number of the voltage input channels, or reducing the opening of the side sensing gate to a size that is even smaller than the diameter of the particle. Due to the high detection sensitivity, detection of 1 mu m particles by a relatively large sensing gate of 5 x 10 x 10 mu m (width x length x height) was successfully demonstrated with a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of approximately 3. This sensor was also applied to detect and count human red blood cells and lymphocyte cells. Results show that this method can clearly distinguish the cells with different sizes based on the pre-determined-thresholds. Because this sensor does not require cells to pass through the sensing gate, the channel clogging problem can be avoided. More importantly, the detection sensitivity can be tuned by applying different voltages without fabricating a smaller sensing gate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we synthesized a ratiometric fluorescence probe (IRh-Ly) for lysosomal hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by adopting a through-bond energy transfer (TBET) strategy on rhodamine-imidazo[1,5-alpha]pyridine platform. IRh-Ly showed brilliant selectivity, rapid response for HOCl. The probe also exhibited high sensitivity with the detection limit calculated to be 10.2 nM. Moreover, we demonstrated its successful application of detecting lysosomal HOCl in living RAW264.7 cells. Notably, the morpholine was integrated into the fluorescent probe IRh-Ly and the results revealed that IRh-Ly could target lysosome and detect the lysosomal HOCl. All the unique features made IRh-Ly particularly suitable for ratiometric HOCl detection and bio-imaging applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is very important to detect native hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the complex biosystems owing to the important roles of HOCl in the immune defense and the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. In this paper, a new p-aminophenylether-based fluorescent probe PAPE-HA was developed for specific detection of HOCl. Probe PAPE-HA could implement the quantitative detection of HOCl ranging from 0 to 1 mu M and the detection limit was obtained as low as 1.37 nM. Additionally, probe PAPE-HA could reach a rapid response for HOCl (<2 min). Importantly, probe PAPE-HA with preeminent specificity and ultra-sensitivity was proven to possess powerful capability of tracking native HOCl in live cells and zebrafish, and we thus anticipate that probe PAPE-HA could be used as a novel promising tool for revealing diverse cellular functions of HOCl.

AB Among organic small molecules, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrazine (NH2NH2) often cause concern because they are widely used in biological and chemical industries. Here, we present a novel probe RH-1 for colorimetric detection of NH2NH2 and fluorescent imaging of H2O2. In this probe, rhodamine was used as the main skeleton due to its favorable spectroscopic performance and stable absorption. Importantly, a benzoic acid group is present in the rhodamine skeleton, which can react with NH2NH2 by amidation. The rhodamine skeleton can also be modified with chromogens to detect H2O2. Results showed that RH-1 can be used for colorimetric detection of NH2NH2 and fluorescent monitoring of H2O2 with high selectivity and sensitivity. The detection limits for NH2NH2 and H2O2 were 0.27 and 0.16 mu M, respectively. Moreover, RH-1 can fluorescently image H2O2 in living cells with low cytotoxicity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were reported to be potential tumor markers for early diagnosis of cancer. Due to its short sequence, low expression level and high susceptibility to degradation, the stable and sensitive detection method of miRNAs is arduous to establish. In this work, we designed a metal chelator (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt, EDTA center dot 2Na) labeled oligonucleotides as the plasmonic signal supraregulator probe to control the generation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Based on another complementary oligonucleotides of target miRNA labeling SiO2 microparticles (SiO(2)MPs) as the detecting platform, EDTA center dot 2Na labeled oligonucleotide probes were immobilized on the SiO2 platform through the sandwich structure in the presence of target miRNA. The sandwich chelating device could further chelate Au3+ to regulate the generation of AuNPs, resulting in colorimetric signal to qualitatively and quantitatively detect the concentration of microRNA-21 (miR-21). The results indicate that the proposed metal chelator-labeled signal amplification method has outstanding sensitivity (LOD = 8.9 fM) and excellent stability, which will be benefit for the early accurate diagnosis of miRNAs.

AB Cell-SELEX is a powerful tool to screen aptamers binding to living cellular organisms such as bacteria, fungi and even oncocytes. Here, we developed an advanced cell-SELEX strategy featuring functionalized graphene oxide (GO) and isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) to select aptamers against a prevailing foodborne pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and chitosan (CTS) were grafted onto the sheet-like GO molecules to synthesize a PC-GO material. TEM and FT-IR characterization demonstrated that the PC-GO composites were near-nanometric scale and tethered with PEG and CTS moieties, a property that significantly improved its solubility in biological buffer solutions used in cell-SELEX process. PC-GO could bind with ssDNAs with lower affinities to target cells, therefore the selection efficiency is greatly enhanced. The cell-binding aptamer candidates (CACs) were amplified by 10(7) fold using complementary ring mediated (CRM-RCA), a created amplification method that generate single-stranded products, which could be directly used in the next round selection. As fueled by PC-GO and CRM-RCA, four highly specific aptamers with lowest K-d value of 10.3 +/- 2.5 nM were obtained. Flow cytometry analysis showed that all the four aptamers exhibited more than 75% binding affinity to V. parahaemolyticus than to other foodborne bacteria (less than 18%). Simple procedure, high efficiency, and free from expensive thermal cycler (required by PCR amplification) will enable the established strategy to find its applications in aptamer selecting against fungi, stem and cancerous cells as well.

AB Immunochemical detection of food allergens is usually based on the use of polyclonal or monoclonal immunoglobulins G (IgG) antibodies. However, due to differences in epitopes recognition between IgG and IgE, an epitope modification during food processing can potentially alter allergenicity and detection in such different way. For that reason, the use of traditional immunological methods to anticipate or study the protein allergenicity is not recommended.
   The objective of this work was to develop a standardized competitive ELISA, based on recombinant IgE antibodies to beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg), to reveal and to measure changes in beta-lg immunoreactivity provoked by technological processes in foods containing this milk protein.
   As a result, a sensitive immunochemical method (Limit of Detection, LOD < 0.2 mu g mL(-1)) has been developed for beta-lg recognition. Also, this technique has been confirmed to detect modifications in beta-lg-IgE binding after food processing (thermal treatment) in a similar way to those results obtained with allergic patients in previous works. Consequently, data obtained with this assay could be used as a preliminary test to predict in vitro beta-lg allergenic behavior in allergenicity studies in processed foods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A new method, pressure assisted partial filling affinity capillary electrophoresis, has been developed to study noncovalent molecular interactions of the hexamer of human insulin (HI) with biologically relevant ligands, basic phenolic neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, basic amino acid arginine, and very weakly acidic phenol, in alkaline aqueous media. The apparent binding constants, K-b, of the HI-ligand complexes were determined from the dependence of the effective migration time changes of the above ligands on the variable zone lengths of HI hexamer dissolved in the background electrolyte (BGE) and hydrodynamically introduced into the bare fused silica capillary close to the UV detector. The strong cationic electroosmotic flow (EOF) in alkaline BGEs, 40/40 mM Tris/tricine, pH 8.1, and 25/34 mM NaOH/tricine, pH 8.5, with EOF mobilities 52.0 x 10(-9) and 58.0 x 10(-9) m(2)V(-1)s(-1), respectively, was reduced by the hydrodynamic counter flow induced by external pressure at the outlet capillary end to avoid expulsion of HI zone out of the capillary and to allow HI interaction with both cationic and anionic ligands inside the capillary. The HI hexamer interactions with the above ligands were found to be weak to moderately strong, with K-b values in the range 385-1314 L mol(-1), and decreasing in the order HIphenol > HI-dopamine > HI-serotonin > HI-arginine.

AB The characterization of wine via MS-based metabolic fingerprinting techniques remains a challenging undertaking due to the large number of phenolic compounds that cannot be confidently annotated and identified within analytical workflows. The combination of high performance liquid chromatography with low-field drift tube ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC x IMS-TOFMS) offers potential for the confident characterization and fingerprinting of wine using a metabolomics-type workflow. In particular, the use of collision cross section values from low-field drift tube IMS using nitrogen as drift gas ((CCSN2)-C-DT) in addition to retention time and a high resolution mass spectrum for putative compounds allows rugged statistical assessment and identity confirmation using CCS libraries (<0.5% error) to be performed. In the present work, an HPLC x IMS-TOFMS platform has been utilized for the fingerprinting of 42 traditionally produced red wines emanating from the Republic of Macedonia. After establishing the reliability of (CCSN2)-C-DT as an identification point for wine metabolomics in both ionization modes, fingerprinting of wines according to grape variety was undertaken and a full dataset containing retention, accurate mass and (CCSN2)-C-DT values used to derive lists of compounds found to be statistically characteristic for each variety. Putative compounds were further assessed by assignment of in-source and post-drift mass fragments aligned according to retention time, drift time, and accurate mass providing up to seven identification points for a single compound when data from both positive and negative mode measurements are combined.

AB This paper focuses on several methodological aspects in the quantitation of volatiles in solid samples by headspace solid phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography and parallel detection by flame ionization detector and mass spectrometry (GC-FID/MS). Informative volatiles, including key odorants and process markers, from single-origin cocoa samples (Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Sao Tome,and Venezuela) were captured at two processing stages along the chocolate production chain (nibs and cocoa mass). Accurate quantitation was achieved by multiple headspace extraction (MHE) in headspace linearity conditions and by external calibration. Quantitative results on selected analytes (3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-heptanol, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethylpyrazine, ethyl octanoate, benzaldehyde, 2-methylpropionic acid, 3-methylbutyric acid, ethyl phenylacetate, 2-phenylethyl acetate, guaiacol, 2-phenylethanol, and (E)-2-phenyl-2-butenal) provided reliable information about the key sensory notes of cocoa intermediates (odor activity values) and their origin specificities. Additional information about analytes release by the solid environment (cocoa nibs, mass, and powders) was achieved by modeling decay curves. Parallel detection by MS and FID enabled quantitative cross-validation, and FID-predicted relative response factors (RRFs) extended method quantitation capabilities to additional compounds that were not subjected to an external calibration procedure: 3-methylbutyl acetate (isoamyl acetate), 2-heptanone, heptanal, 2-nonanone, gamma-butyrolactone, octanoic acid, 2-ethyl-5(6)-methylpyrazine, phenylacetic acid, phenol, 2-acetyl pyrrole, and 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl(4H)-pyran-4-one. This procedure extends method capabilities and information potential with great consistency. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Global food and water safety issues have prompted the development of highly sensitive, specific, and fast analytical techniques for food and water analysis. The electrochemical aptamer-based detection platform (E-aptasensor) is one of the more promising detection techniques because of its unique combination of advantages that renders these sensors ideal for detection of a wide range of target analytes. Recent research results have further demonstrated that this technique has potential for real world analysis of food and water contaminants. This review summaries the recently developed E-aptasensors for detection of analytes related to food and water safety, including bacteria, mycotoxins, algal toxins, viruses, drugs, pesticides, and metal ions. Ten different electroanalytical techniques and one opto-electroanalytical technique commonly employed with these sensors are also described. In addition to highlighting several novel sensor designs, this review also describes the strengths, limitations, and current challenges this technology faces, and future development trend.

AB Currently, there is great interest in bringing the application of IR spectroscopy into the clinic. This however will require a significant reduction in measurement time as Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) imaging takes hours to days to scan a clinically relevant specimen. A potential remedy for this issue is the use of Quantum Cascade Laser Infrared (QCL IR) microscopy performed in Discrete Frequency (DF) mode for maximum speed gain. This gain could be furthermore improved by applying a proper denoising algorithm that takes into account the specific data structure. We have recently compared spectral and spatial denoising techniques in the context of Fourier Transform IR (FT-IR) imaging and showed that the optimal methods depend heavily on the exact data structure. In general multivariate denoising methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) are the most effective for a dataset containing multiple bands. Histologic classification of QCL IR images of pancreatic tissue using Random Forest was therefore performed to investigate which denoising schemes are the most optimal for such experimental data structure. This work is the first to show the effects of denoising on classification accuracy of QCL data and is likely to be transferable to other QCL microscopes and other modalities using DF imaging, e.g. AFM-IR or CARS/SRS imaging.

AB Visual-Near-Infra-Red (VIS/NIR) spectroscopy has led the revolution in high-throughput phenotyping methods used to determine chemical and structural elements of organic materials. In the current state of the art, spectrophotometers used for imaging techniques are either very expensive or too large to be used as a field-operable device. In this study we developed a Sparse NIR Optimization method (SNIRO) that selects a pre-determined number of wavelengths that enable quantification of analytes in a given sample using linear regression. We compared the computed complexity time and the accuracy of SNIRO to Marten's test, to forward selection test and to LASSO all applied to the determination of protein content in corn flour and meat and octane number in diesel using publicly available datasets. In addition, for the first time, we determined the glucose content in the green seaweed Ulva sp., an important feedstock for marine biorefinery. The SNIRO approach can be used as a first step in designing a spectrophotometer that can scan a small number of specific spectral regions, thus decreasing, potentially, production costs and scanner size and enabling the development of field-operable devices for content analysis of complex organic materials.

AB In this study, the separation of inorganic mono and divalent cations using multi-lumen silica capillaries (MLCs) of 126 channels, each with either 4 or 8 mm inner diameter, was investigated using capillary electrophoresis and on-capillary capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-(CD)-D-4). MLCs provided sufficiently high surface area-to-volume ratios to generate significant wall ion-exchange interactions for the divalent cations, which significantly affected resultant selectivity, whereas monovalent cations were predominantly separated by simple electrophoresis. The resultant hybrid selectivity was seen for both 4 and 8 mm channel multi-lumen capillaries, without any preconditioning or capillary wall modification. Remarkably, the electrophoretic mobilities for the divalent cations Mg2+ and Ca2+ were reduced 7.5 times compared to those determined using a single channel open tubular capillary of 50 mm i.d., providing much improved selectivity. Apparent electrophoretic mobilities of divalent cations increased as the concentration of BGE increased, while those of monovalent cations decreased parallel to electroosmotic mobility. These results show the electrostatic interaction between the divalent cations and the silica wall. At least, this specific separation of mono-and divalent cations were clearly observed with a mixture standards solution of less than 200 mu molL(-1). Using a MLC with 126 x 8 mm i.d. channels and 49.1 cm in length, together with a 20 mmolL(-1) MES/His BGE, containing 2 mmolL(-1) 18-crown-6, monovalent cations (NH4+, K+ Na+ and Li+) and divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) could be completely separated within 4 min. For monovalent cations, on-capillary detection using (CD)-D-4 provided calibration curve (0-200 mu molL(-1)) correlation coefficients in the range R-2 = 0.995-0.999, and limits of detection of 2.2-6.6 mu molL(-1). Relative standard deviations for migration times were less than 0.6%, and recoveries ranged from the 93.8%-105.4%. The new method was applied to the separation and quantitative determination of monovalent and divalent cations in drinking waters and soil extracts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electroanalytical methodology by boron-doped diamond electrode (BDDE) associated to the square-wave voltammetry (SWV) for the determination of hydrolyzed dipyrone (DIP) in commercial formulations, raw natural waters and in human urine was developed. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV), it was shown that the oxidation of the DIP on the BDDE was irreversible with diffusional control. Computational studies suggested that the oxidation mechanism of DIP occurred with participation of two electrons and one proton. The analytical curves were obtained for concentrations of DIP ranging from 1.0 x 10(-6) to 6.5 x 10(-5) mol L-1 (r = 0.9994). The values of detection limit (LOD) and quantification limit (LOQ) of DIP were calculated from SWV and found to be 2.6 x 10(-7) mol L-1 and 8.8 x 10(-7) mol L-1. The methodology was effectively applied to real samples with the values of calculated recoveries varying between 91.0% and 117.3% and validated by iodometric titration experiments whose values were between 93.3% and 106.9%. The proposed methodology with BDDE represents an alternative tool and it has advantageous, such as very easy handling, low cost, no need for modification, low detection limit. Furthermore, it can be used for the routine analysis of DIP in different real samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent advances to utilize two or more nanoparticles for developing novel sensors with superior sensitivity have spurred advanced detection limits even at low concentrations. In this research, a blend of rutheniumdoped TiO2 (Ru-TiO2) nanoparticles and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) loaded into carbon paste matrix to fabricate a novel Ru-TiO2/MWCNTs-CPE sensor was used for the detection and quantification of flufenamic acid (FFA) and mefenamic acid (MFA) drugs. The surface morphology of Ru-TiO2 was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Sensitivity and selectivity of the electrode was improved at the Ru-TiO2/MWCNTs modified CPE compared to nascent CPE due to the amazing surface distinctive characteristics of the modifier at pH 5.0. The effect of concentration of the modifier, pH, pre-concentration time, sweep rate and concentration on signal enhancement of FFA and MFA was studied. The square wave voltammetry (SWV) currents are linearly related in the concentration range of 0.01 mu M-0.9 mu M with the detection limit values of 0.68 nM for FFA and 0.45 nM for MFA, respectively. The developed electrode assembly was used for the quantification of both the drug analytes in human urine samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Synchronous measurement of brain neurotransmitters and blood drug metabolism by dual sites in vivo microdialysis can provide very important information for several neurological disorders such as post-stroke depression (PSD). In this work, d(0)/d(3)-6-N-methyl-rhodamine 6G-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl formate (d(0)/d(3)-MRSF) were firstly designed, synthesized and used as stable isotope labeling derivatization reagents for the determination of multiple neurotransmitters by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The light d(0)-MRSF was used to label neurotransmitters in real samples and the heavy d(3)-MRSF was used to label standards, which served as internal standards for quantification to minimize matrix effect. The d(0)/d(3)-MRSF-neurotransmitter derivatives were easily adsorbed onto the surface of Fe3O4@graphene oxide. Magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction followed with stable isotope labeling derivatization was developed for efficient sample pretreatment. The permanent positively charged moiety of d(0)/d(3)-MRSF significantly enhanced the ionization efficiency of neurotransmitters. The comparison results indicated that the synthesized MRSF derivatization method can bring better detection sensitivity than the commercial dansyl chloride method about tens to hundreds of times on the same instrumentation. Specific and regular product ions of m/z 413.3 and 416.3, m/z 429.4 and 432.4 were observed for d(0)-and d(3)-MRSF labeled neurotransmitters, respectively. The limits of detection were in the range of 2.0-40.0 pM. The accuracies ranged from 92.3% to 108.2% with the intra- and inter-day precisions in the range of 2.2-12.8%. Synchronous and dynamic determination of concentrations changes of brain neurotransmitters and blood gastrodin of PSD rats was achieved. The results indicated that gastrodin had analogous regulating effect of brain neurotransmitter, which like the clinical medicine fluoxetine of PSD. Taken together, the developed method was demonstrated to be promising for sensitive, accurate and simultaneous determination of multiple neurotransmitters in trace biofluids. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Various protocols are currently used to study marine lipids, but there is a growing interest in working on dry samples that are easier to transport. However, reference protocols are still lacking for dry samples. In order to make recommendations on this use, lipid classes and fatty acids (FA) obtained from six analytical protocols using two different tissue states (dry vs wet) and three extraction methods (automat vs manual potter vs leaving the solvent to work on tissue) were compared. Three dry storage modes of tissue (freezer vs gas nitrogen vs dry room) during one and three months were also compared. These comparisons were made on seven marine species with different lipid profiles, including fishes, crustaceans and mollusks. Lipid classes and FA obtained from wet and dry tissues were similar, but they were affected by the extraction methods. Regardless of tissue state, "Leave to work" methods obtained the highest lipid quantities, followed by manual potter and automat methods (ca. 90% and 80% of "Leave to work" methods, respectively). Linear relationships allowed correction for lipid classes and FA concentrations obtained from different protocols. The repeatability of all protocols still needs to be improved, especially for fish species. Increasing the replicate number for each sample might be an indirect way to improve lipid quantification. Our results show that storing dry tissues in the freezer for more than one month was associated with a decrease in lipids, which is also observed for other storage methods. For qualitative studies of FA (expressed in %), a three-month storage of dry tissue in freezer did not affect the relative composition of species/tissues with a lipid content below 20% of dry weight.

AB Particle-based assays are widely used in many biomedical applications. However, the performance of particle-based systems is often compromised by the carry-over contamination caused by the residual reagents during the liquid-exchange process. We have developed a sieve-through platform that utilizes a porous membrane to sieve out the particles, and an absorbent pad to remove the waste liquid by capillary force. The porous membrane is able to contain the liquid in the reaction chamber, and allows the waste liquid to flow through when it is brought into contact with the absorbent pad. The sieve-through platform is able to effectively remove the waste liquid, thereby achieving a more efficient liquid exchange as compared to the conventional process, and minimizing the carry-over contamination. In this study, we have determined the factors that affect the flow characteristics through the porous membrane on the sieve-through platform. We have shown that the sieve-through platform effectively reduces the carry-over contamination. In addition, we have shown particle-based ELISA on the sieve-through platform for the analysis of proteins and cells. We have further demonstrated the potential of the sieve-through platform for high-throughput analysis by presenting a sieve-array, which allows concurrent analysis of multiple samples in parallel. The sieve-through platform can significantly improve the performance of particle-based systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gas chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass analyzer (QTOF) with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source has been tested to study the ionization and mass spectrometric behavior of long-chain and very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs, C18-24; VLC-PUFAs, >C-24). The protonated molecule ([M+H](+)), measured at accurate mass, became the base peak of the spectrum for all the studied compounds and was promoted by the addition of water into the source. This fact overcame the existing difficulties for the identification of VLC-PUFAs when using an electron ionization source (EI). The extensive fragmentation of PUFAs in this source is the main drawback due to the fact that since reference standards are not commercially available, final identification relies on retention time estimation. The application of GC-APCI-QTOF to the screening of lipid extracts from the eyes of different fish species added confidence to the identification of several VLC-PUFAs. Further investigation of ion ratios allowed to predict the position of key double bonds enabling the classification of VLC-PUFAs as omega 3 or omega 6 compounds. VLC-PUFAs spectra found in biological samples were compared to those obtained from corresponding peaks found in heterologous expression experiments of fish's Elovl4. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) at atmospheric pressure (AP) is, with a few notable exceptions, overshadowed by its vacuum based forms and AP transmission mode (TM) MALDI-MS lacks the up-take its potential benefits might suggest. The reasons for this are not fully understood and it is clear further development is required to realise the flexibility and power of this ionisation method and geometry. Here we report the build of a new AP-TM-MALDI-MSI ion source with plasma ionisation enhancement. This novel ion source is used to analyse a selection of increasingly complex systems from molecular standards to murine brain tissue sections. Significant enhancement of detected ion intensity is observed in both positive and negative ion mode in all systems, with up to 2000 fold increases observed for a range of tissue endogenous species. The substantial improvements conferred by the plasma enhancement are then employed to demonstrate the acquisition of proof of concept tissue images, with high quality spectra obtained down to 10 x 10 mu m pixel size.

Different techniques of analysis such as XRD, FE-SEM, TGA, XPS, HRTEM and BET were applied for morphological and spectroscopic characterization of the ZnWO3/rGO HNC. The sensing evaluation of the constructed sensor showed high selectivity, sensitivity and a linear correlation between achieved responses and concentration of target gas (1-10 ppm) with R-2 = 0.993 at temperature of 95 degrees C. The determination of FA was validated and performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry combined by solid phase micro-extraction after derivatization with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoro-benzyl)-hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Validation was carried out in terms of limit of detection linearity, precision, and recovery. The mechanistic evaluation of sensing behavior of the ZnWO3/rGO HNC was interpreted based on large specific surface area (SSA) to volume, mesoporous structure and the heterojunction between rGO and ZnWO3 at the interface between the rGO and ZnWO3.

AB A simple colorimetric assay for sugars (monosaccharides, polyols and disaccharides) quantification based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) formation is proposed. Sugars are able to form AgNPs reducing Ag+ and stabilizing the suspension. Since the driving force is not only chemical reduction, the optimized assay allows the determination of both "reducing" and "non-reducing" sugars with similar reactivity. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption band with maximum wavelength centered at approximate to 430 nm (A(430)) is used for the detection. Monosaccharides, disaccharides and polyols with different functional groups and structure have been investigated: D-(+)-glucose, D-(+)-galactose, D-(-)-fructose, sucrose, D-(+)-raffinose D-(+)-maltose, D-(+)-trehalose, D-mannitol, D-sorbitol, i-inositol, xylitol and D-( +)-xylose. The resulting AgNPs have been characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The reactivity of monomers and polyols was found higher than the disaccharides. The AgNPs-based method was applied to the determination of the sugars content in soft drinks (n = 6) and apple extracts (n = 5). Sugars content (expressed as glucose equivalents) determined by the proposed assay resulted comparable to results obtained by ion chromatography (R = 0.994). Reproducibility (RSD <= 9.4%) and recovery values (from 86.1% to 117.7%) in food matrices were satisfactory. Moreover, the assay is selective vs. potentially interfering compounds found in food. Considering the assay time (10 min), the low cost of reagents, limited volumes of sample (5 -100 mu L), no use of organic solvents and low waste generation, this assay appears very promising for sugars content determination.

AB During the past decade, accumulating studies have been conducted on the mesoporous silica materials as the matrix of controlled drug-delivery, in which the complicated post-synthesis procedures are often involved with the molecular design to achieve the efficacy. In this study, a simplified drug delivery system of anti-cancer drug of doxorubicin (DOX) based on mesoporous SBA-15 functionalized with ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FCA) was constructed. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, the presence of FCA that was anchored inside the pore wall of amine groups grafted SBA-15 exhibits electron-accessible behavior without affecting the intactness of composite material. The pH-responsive release of drug molecules was achieved through the conjugation of DOX with FCA in the interior channels of mesoporous composites, which also favors the more coverage of DOX. Furthermore, the real-time cell analysis was performed to monitor the release of DOX from the mesopores and resulting cytotoxicity of cancer cell of A549 was evaluated, which results in a calculated IC50 of 43.8 mu g/ml (24 h). The constructed mesoporous FCA-SBA-15 composite material provides an integrated nanoplatform to exert controlled-delivery of anti-cancer drug molecules. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In medicine, the detection and identification of biothiols have received increasing attention due to their crucial roles in life activities. Hence, we present a facile, rapid, and effective method for identification of five kinds of biothiols including glutathione (GSH), L-cysteine (Cys), dithiothreitol (DTT), 2-mercaptoethanol (MCE), and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). The proposed sensor array is fabricated based on single-stranded poly (thymine/cytosine)-templated fluorescent copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), which are controlled through thymine-Hg2+-thymine (T-Hg2+-T) and cytosine-Ag+-cytosine (Ce-Ag+-C) coordination. The results show that single-stranded poly T and poly C are used as a highly efficient template, and ascorbic acid acts as a reductant to form CuNPs. Owing to the different thiol binding affinity between Hg2+ (pK(d) = 3.90) and Ag+ (pK(d) = 5.50), the sensor array produces a unique pattern of fluorescence variations when it interacts with the five biothiols. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied to analyze the fluorescence pattern and generated a clustering map for a clear identification of the five biothiols. By employing this "turn-on" sensor array, five thiols were successfully discirminated at the 50 nM level in buffer solution and serum samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A phenanthroline (phen) tethered berberine dimer 1 is synthesized and further conjugated with carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled single-stranded probe DNA (P-DNA) to give P-DNA@1. The mutual interaction of these two components triggers the fluorescence quenching of FAM, and the non-emissive P-DNA@1, in turn, functions as a sensor to detect cancer-associated microRNA-185 (miRNA-185), characterized by the FAM fluorescence recovery. The results show that P-DNA@1 is capable of detecting miRNA-185 in 2 min with the detection limit of 0.2 nM. The detection mechanism was supported by fluorescence anisotropy, binding constant and molecular docking study. Competing experiments further indicate that P-DNA@1 exhibits a high selectivity for miRNA-185 thus has a good potential in the diagnosis of related cancer at the early stage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, molecular structure regulation and enzyme cascade signals amplification (MRECAmp) strategy was proposed to construct a novel upconversion ratiometric fluorescence and colorimetric dual-readout assay platform for highly sensitive and selective detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The detection strategy is divided into three aspects. Firstly, Ag+ oxidates o-phenylenediamine (OPD) to 2,3-diaminophennazine (OPDox), which can significantly quench upconversion fluorescence at 487 nm based on inner filter effects (IFE) while the upconversion emission at 668 nm was essentially unchanged for Zn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) probes under the nearinfrared (NIR) irradiation. Secondly, ALP catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) to ascorbic acid (AA) which can consume part of Ag+ to inhibit the generation of OPDox and the AA was oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA). The specific performance of DHAA molecular structure regulation, due to the condensation reaction between dicarbonyl group of DHAA and diamine group of OPD, that is confirmed by ESI-MS and H-1 NMR spectra analysis, can remarkably enhance the selectivity of ALP detection, which is conceptually different from the previously reported ALP fluorescent assays. Thirdly, the generated DHAA reacts with OPD to form 3-(dihydroxyethyl) furo [3,4-b]quinoxaline-1-one (DFQ) that further inhibits the generation of OPDox, which makes the enzyme-controlled cascade signal amplification (ECAmp) can be realized with a great fluorescence recovery (60.04%) at 487 nm. Therefore, the fluorescence response signal ((I-487/I-668)(0)/(I-487/I-668)) is amplified by ECAmp strategy, allowing the quantitative analysis of ALP with a detection limit of 0.03 mU/mL. The detection of ALP activity in human serum samples over the conventional methods demonstrates that the MRECAmp method provides a sensing platform for probing ALP activity and shows promising outlook in biomedical studies.

AB In this study, a novel biocompatible fluorescent probe (DN) capable of detecting ClO- in physiological medium was rationally designed and synthesized from natural and renewable isolongifolanone. This probe underwent a highly specific and sensitive oxidation reaction with ClO- and liberated an isolongifolanone derivative (PA) emitting intensive blue fluorescence. In response to ClO-, the fluorescence emission of DN was obviously enhanced within a short time. The detection limit of DN toward ClO- was found to be as low as 5.86 x 10(-9) M. IR, MS and DFT calculation were employed to further confirm the sensing mechanism. Moreover, the test strips coated with DN could easily recognize ClO- from other relevant species through the changes of fluorescence color under 365 nm UV lamp. More importantly, we also successfully demonstrated the potential application of DN for the detection of intracellular hypochloritein living cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mutation of p53 tumor suppressor gene represents one of the early molecular events in tumor initiation and progression. Although molecular computing holds tremendous potential with important applications in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of human diseases at the molecular level, designing molecular logic gates to implement cascade amplification via operating autonomously for the detection of point mutations still remains challenging. In this contribution, we developed a three concatenated logic gates (TCLG) to perform multiple strand displacement amplification (m-SDA) for screening the cancer-related point mutations only via designing an innovative molecular beacon (MB). Specifically, using p53 gene as model target, extending the two ends of a MB via adding two fragments with the same sequence achieves two unique terminal single-stranded (ss) overhangs. After self-folding of MB into hairpin structure, the two overhangs exhibit a near inverted mirror image (IM) relationship if taking the base nature and direction into account. For this, the probe is called IM-MB. Because cascade SDAs can occur on IM-MB and promote each other, the target gene can be detected down to 10 pM. Along this line, the TCLG circuit was proposed, and two primers and target gene serve as the indispensable input signals. Utilizing this logic circuit, the point mutation or absence of target gene can be sensitively screened. Moreover, its potential application in the recognition of point mutations in complex biomatrix has been demonstrated via blind test. The proof-of-concept scheme is expected to provide new insight into the development of DNA-based molecular logic gates and their applications in basic research, medical diagnosis and precise treatment and treatment of genetic diseases.

AB Nucleic acid isothermal amplification detection technologies have undergone rapid development in the field of molecular diagnosis due to their freedom from the limitations of complex temperature control equipment. In recent years, with the use of newly discovered nicking endonucleases, a novel isothermal amplification technique, -nicking enzyme-assisted amplification (NEAA), has been developed. NEAA reactions offer high levels of amplification efficiency and can exponentially amplify a target nucleic acid over a very short period of time. NEAA has been widely used in many fields, including those of molecular diagnosis, disease detection, biochemical identification, and many more. NEAA reactions also present some drawbacks, (e.g., severe non-specific amplification and strong background signals.) The principle, advantages and disadvantages of NEAA technologies are discussed. Applications and comparisons of NEAA to similar methods are described in this review. We hope that this review will serve as inspiration for further NEAA research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In LC-MS based untargeted analysis, data is collected at the peak or ion level, although the investigated biochemistry processes occur at the compound or reaction level. To this end, the presence of redundancy peaks such as co-eluted peaks, multi-chargers, adducts, neutral loss, isotopologues, and fragments ions often muddle subsequent statistical data analysis. In order to fill this gap, between peaks and compounds/reactions, independent components must first be found at the peak level, then evaluated at the compound or reaction levels. Based on paired mass distances (PMD), the algorithm GlobalStd, based on retention time hierarchical cluster analysis and global analysis of PMDs within clusters, is here proposed to extract independent peaks from raw LC-MS data. Following its application, a structure/reaction directed analysis can then be used to evaluate compounds at the structure or biochemistry reaction level, based on similar PMDs among different retention times clusters. As a proof-of-concept, the developed statistical method was applied to data obtained for in vivo SPME sampling on fish. In total, 277 independent peaks were demonstrated to stand for most of the variances found for the total 1459 ions detected via LC-MS. Following, both known homologous series or biological reactions along with unknown bio-processes, which may involve oxidation/reduction reactions or homologous series, were analyzed via a structure/reaction directed analysis. The findings of this analysis yielded interesting information regarding the data, for instance denoting the possible occurrence of a biosynthesis process involving L-Carnitine and its precursor 4-Trimethylammoniobutanoic acid. Such PMD relationships could also aid in the screening of annotation results. To this end, semi-quantitative analysis based on structure/reaction directed analysis is also here proposed for further investigation of unknown patterns or for removal of contaminants in metabolomics studies. The developed data-driven algorithm has been included in a PMD package with a GUI interactive document, and is freely available online (https://github.com/yufree/pmd). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Standardization of near infrared (NIR) spectra is indispensable in practical applications because the spectra measured on different instruments are commonly used and the difference between the instruments must be corrected. A two-level standardization method is proposed in this study based on multi-level simultaneous component analysis (MSCA) algorithm for correcting the spectral difference between instruments. A two-level MSCA model is used to model the difference between instruments (the first level) and samples (the second level). With the two models, the spectral difference due to instruments and measurement operation can be corrected, respectively. Three NIR spectral datasets of pharmaceutical tablet, corn and plant leaf are used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the score of the first level model describes the overall spectral difference between instruments, and the score of the second level model depictures the spectral difference of the same sample between the measurements. The latter difference may include the spectral variations caused by instrument, operation and the measurement conditions. Therefore, both the spectral difference due to the instrument and measurement can be corrected by adjusting the coefficients in the scores of the two level models, respectively. The proposed method provides a good way for standardizing the spectra measured on different instruments when the measurement is not reproducible. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vibrational micro-spectroscopy is a powerful optical tool, providing a non-invasive label-free chemically specific imaging for many chemical and biomedical applications. However, hyperspectral image produced by Raman micro-spectroscopy typically consists of thousands discrete pixel points, each having individual Raman spectrum at thousand wavenumbers, and therefore requires appropriate image unmixing computational methods to retrieve non-negative spatial concentration and corresponding non-negative spectra of the image biochemical constituents. Here, we present a new efficient Quantitative Hyperspectral Image Unmixing (Q-HIU) method for large-scale Raman micro-spectroscopy data analysis. This method enables to simultaneously analyse multi-set Raman hyperspectral images in three steps: (i) Singular Value Decomposition with innovative Automatic Divisive Correlation which autonomously filters spatially and spectrally uncorrelated noise from data; (ii) a robust subtraction of fluorescent background from the data using a newly developed algorithm called Bottom Gaussian Fitting; (iii) an efficient Quantitative Unsupervised/Partially Supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization method, which rigorously retrieves non-negative spatial concentration maps and spectral profiles of the samples' biochemical constituents with no a priori information or when one or several samples' constituents are known. As compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach allows to achieve significantly more accurate results and efficient quantification with several orders of magnitude shorter computational time as verified on both artificial and real experimental data. We apply Q-HIU to the analysis of large-scale Raman hyperspectral images of human atherosclerotic aortic tissues and our results show a proof-of-principle for the proposed method to retrieve and quantify the biochemical composition of the tissues, consisting of both high and low concentrated compounds. Along with the established hallmarks of atherosclerosis including cholesterol/cholesterol ester, triglyceride and calcium hydroxyapatite crystals, our Q-HIU allowed to identify the significant accumulations of oxidatively modified lipids co-localizing with the atherosclerotic plaque lesions in the aortic tissues, possibly reflecting the persistent presence of inflammation and oxidative damage in these regions, which are in turn able to promote the disease pathology. For minor chemical components in the diseased tissues, our Q-HIU was able to detect the signatures of calcium hydroxyapatite and beta-carotene with relative mean Raman concentrations as low as 0.09% and 0.04% from the original Raman intensity matrix with noise and fluorescent background contributions of 3% and 94%, respectively.

AB In this study, both electricity generation capability and biodegradation process of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were investigated using a defined ternary culture of Paenibacillus sp., Klebsiella sp. and Geobacter sulfurreducens as biocatalysts in MFCs. The maximum current density achieved by the ternary culture from CMC was 621 +/- 23 mu A cm(-2) in half-cell experiments and the maximum power density reached to 1146 +/- 28 mW m(-2) in two-chamber MFCs. Meanwhile, the ternary culture also possessed three times higher CMC degradation capability compared to the pure strain J1. Besides, the key metabolite products, including cellobiose, glucose, acetate, were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to illustrate the biodegradation process of CMC. The high electricity generation performance mainly resulted from the "division-of-labor" based cooperation and the enhanced extracellular electron transfer caused by the electron shuttle secreted by Klebsiella sp. This study highlighted the synergistic effect of specific community on electricity generation using CMC as carbon source, and laid the foundation for further optimization of more efficient and stable microbial consortia for bioenergy applications.

AB In present work, a versatile "signal-on" electrochemical aptasensor with ultra-sensitivity and high selectivity for detecting acetamiprid residues has been successfully constructed. Electrochemistry behaviors of as-synthesized copper-centered metal-organic frameworks (CuMOF) on various electrodes were investigated in details. The results indicated that CuMOF exhibited well-behaved redox events. Thus, we used Au-CuMOF as signaling element to label probe DNA (pDNA). The gold nanoparticles-reduced graphene oxide (Au-rGO) has a high specific surface area and excellent conductivity, which was utilized to immobilize complementary strand (cDNA). In the presence of acetamiprid, Au-CuMOF-labeled pDNA would hybridize with the exposed cDNA, allowing CuMOF to approach the electrode and produce a sensitive signaling current. Such a "signal-on" method does not suffer from the drawbacks of "signal-off" methods. The linear range of this proposed electrochemical aptasensor was 0.1 pM-10.0 nM and the detection limit was as low as 2.9 fM. This platform exhibited wonderful selectivity, stability, and repeatability, and was successfully applied to detect acetamiprid residues in tea samples exhibiting enormous practical application potential.

AB In the study, the voltammetric electronic tongue based on three nanocomposites modified electrodes was applied for the identification of rice wines of different geographical origins. The nanocomposites were prepared by gold and copper nanoparticles in the presence of conducting polymers (polymer sulfanilic acid, polymer glutamic acid) and carboxylic multi - walled carbon nanotubes. The modified electrodes showed high sensitivity to guanosine - 5' - monophosphate disodium salt, tyrosine and gallic acid which have good correlation with the geographical origins of rice wines. Scanning electron microscopy was performed to display the surface morphologies of the nanocomposites, and cyclic voltammetry was applied to study the electrochemical behaviors of the taste substances on the electrode surfaces. Four types of electrochemical parameters (pH, scan rates, accumulation potentials and time) were optimized for getting a low limit of the detection of each taste substance. The geographical information of rice wines was obtained by the modified electrodes based on two types of multi - frequency large amplitude pulse voltammetry, and "area method" was applied for extracting the feature data from the original information obtained. Based on the area feature data, principal component analysis, locality preserving projection (LPP), and linear discriminant analysis were applied for the classification of the rice wines of different geographical origins, and LPP presented the best results; extreme learning machine (ELM) and alibrary for support vector machines were applied for predicting the geographical origins of rice wines, and ELM performed better.

AB Two fusion methods were established for rapid determination of Pu in soil and sediment samples. The methods consisted of NH4HSO4 or NH4HF2 fusion procedures incorporated with procedures for CaF2/LaF3 co-precipitation, extraction chromatography and SF-ICP-MS measurement. The fusion procedures were done on a portable hot plate instead of in a cumbersome muffle furnace and took only 15 min heating-up time from room temperature to 250 degrees C and 15 min fusion time at 250 degrees C. Chemical recoveries of Pu after completing the NH4HSO4 and NH4HF2 fusion methods for 0.5-1 g sample were approximately 70% and more than 90%, respectively, and decreased with the increase of sample weight from 0.5 g to 5 g. Sediment samples were pre-ignited at different temperatures ranging from 450 degrees C to 1000 degrees C to form refractory fractions of Pu, with which the dissolution rates of Pu by the NH4HSO4 and NH4HF2 fusion were investigated. With the increase of pre-ignition temperature of the sediment samples, the dissolution rates of Pu from the samples prepared by NH4HSO4 fusion declined dramatically from near 100% for 450 degrees C to 8% for 1000 degrees C. In contrast, the NH4HF2 fusion was capable of completely releasing Pu from samples that were pre-ignited at temperatures over 450 degrees C to 1000 degrees C, which was comparable to releases obtained by the hazardous and time-consuming HNO3-HF digestion, and was superior to the conventional HNO3 digestion. Additionally, because HF is not used in any procedure of the NH4HF2 fusion, a safer and greener alternative to NH4HSO4 fusion and HNO3-HF digestion is realized for rapid Pu determination in environmental samples for nuclear emergency response and application in environmental studies.

AB N-glycome profile of serum has been considered as potential source of biomarker discovery for decades. However, the time-consuming sample preparation and difficulties in N-glycan enrichment limit N-glycome exploration and further applications. Here, a strategy for rapid N-glycome profiling of complex biological samples has been developed. Easy-to-prepare and cost-friendly sterilized cotton is utilized as a matrix for sample absorption, quick enzymatic deglycosylation, and highly selective N-glycan enrichment. Using this multifunctional matrix, a corresponding centrifuge-assisted sample preparation approach and its protocol were developed. Sample preparation could be completed within 2.5 h, while traditional methods usually cost more than 24 h. Additionally, selectivity towards glycan was increased 100 folds than commercially available purification microtips, making the detection more sensitive. Finally, this strategy was successfully applied to analyze the serum N-glycome of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and healthy individuals, the glycan ratio (Hex5HexNAc4Sia2/Hex5HexNAc4Sia1) was found to significantly increase among CRC patients.

AB Analysis of organic pollutants is usually accomplished in centralized laboratories. However, the time-delayed and time-consuming process is insufficient and risky for precisely detection due to the contamination of vials, the losses of analytes during transportation and storage. Herein, a rapid and highly sensitive on-site detection approach was developed without using any vials by coupling an on-site pre-equilibrium solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling method with a portable gas chromatography mass spectrometer (portable GC-MS), for the determination of three families of persistent organic pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Based on sampling-rate (SR) calibration method, the concentrations of target analytes in aquatic systems could be easily determined. Limits of detection (LODs) in the low parts-per-tillion levels (<= 5.25 ng.L-1) were obtained for most of the investigated analytes with a total analysis time only similar to 30 min. The proposed on-site detection approach was then successfully applied in the determination of persistent organic pollutants in real aquatic environment. A comparable result obtained by liquid extraction (LE) equipped with laboratorial GC-MS demonstrated the accuracy of the on-site detection method. In general, this study demonstrated a rapid and highly sensitive on-site approach, avoiding any risks of contamination during sampling and analysis, for determination of POPs as well as the potential applications for other organic pollutants in aquatic phase.

AB Tissue metabolomics can play an important role in biological studies and biomarker discovery. However, high-coverage metabolome analysis of tissue samples remains a challenge. In this work, we report an analytical method for in-depth tissue metabolome profiling with highly accurate metabolite quantification. This method is based on tissue homogenization with an extraction solvent mixture of methanol, dichloromethane and water, high-performance differential chemical isotope labeling (CIL) of metabolite extracts, followed by high-resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detection of labeled metabolites. The method development was initially carried out using chicken liver tissue. To demonstrate the analytical performance and potential applications of this approach in real world tissue metabolomics, we examined changes in the amine/phenol submetabolome of liver and brain tissues from an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. A total of 2319 and 1769 peak pairs or amine-/phenol-containing metabolites were commonly detected in 80% of the liver samples (n = 22) and 80% of the brain samples (n = 22), respectively. In liver samples, 89 metabolites were positively identified using labeled standard library and 1063 peak pairs were putatively matched to metabolome databases, while 78 were positively identified and 753 were putatively matched in brain samples. Using multivariate and univariate analyses to study these metabolites, we observed significant metabolome differences between AD transgenic mice and wild-type mice in both liver and brain tissues, with several metabolite biomarker candidates having good discriminative power. We envisage that the CIL LC-MS method reported herein can be used in various application areas requiring in-depth analysis of tissue metabolomes. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is one of the most powerful ionization techniques for characterization of analytes in various areas. Polar solvents such as methanol, water and acetonitrile are commonly used for ESI-MS analysis, while nonpolar solvents such as hexane were usually considered as non-ESI-friendly solvents. Following our recent work on observation of ESI process from solid substrates using nonpolar solvents (Anal Chim Acta, 2018, 1004, 51-57), the analytical properties of ESI-MS with solid substrates and nonpolar solvents were further systematically investigated in this study. Compared to the uses of polar solvents, our results revealed that nonpolar solvents could serve as extractants for enhanced detection of low-polar analytes from complex samples, and could serve as refrigerants for rapid freezing of samples such as peptides, proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, nonpolar solvents could be used for formation of ammonia-transition-metal acetylacetonates complexes under ambient conditions. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most common malignancy of the oral cavity, is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality worldwide. Moreover, knowledge of the metabolic alterations that occur in OSCC is still limited. In the present study, we used a quantitative metabolomic approach with chemical isotope labeling (CIL) to analyze alterations in the metabolite levels in paired cancerous (T) and adjacent noncancerous (AN) tissues from 31 OSCC patients. Using volcano plot and orthogonal projections to latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), we uncovered 99 dysregulated metabolites in OSCC and verified the identities of seven metabolites via comparison with authenticated standards. From these seven metabolites, we constructed a 3-marker panel, consisting of putrescine, glycyl-leucine, and phenylalanine, using a support vector machine (SVM) model that can discriminate T from AN with high sensitivity and specificity based on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Furthermore, by integrating the metabolomics profiles with transcriptomics data obtained from the same sample set, we revealed the dysregulation of the polyamine pathway in OSCC. Our findings provide insights into the metabolic perturbations present in OSCC and have uncovered potential metabolic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for use in the treatment of OSCC.

AB We present a novel dual redox labeling approach enabling a facile relative evaluation of protein-DNA interactions based on immunoprecipitation at magnetic beads (MBIP) with subsequent electro-chemical detection. DNA probes labeled with two different electroactive markers, benzofurazane and nitrobenzene, which yield reduction peaks at distinct potentials, were synthesized using primer extension (PEX) reaction. We show that using the labeled DNA probes, specific and non-specific binding of the p53 protein can be distinguished in a simple competition binding experiment, as a strong preference of the p53 protein was observed towards DNA probes bearing a specific p53 binding site (p53CON), which is in agreement with known binding properties of the p53 protein. The p53 binding to the individual DNA probes can be modulated by specific monoclonal antibodies used for the immuno-precipitation. This approach can potentially be applied, after selection of appropriate DNA probes and monoclonal antibodies, for investigations of DNA-binding properties of other proteins and thus represents a versatile tool for studies of any DNA-binding proteins.

AB Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a useful platform for nucleic acids detection in pointof- care (POC) situations, and development of single-step, close-tube LAMP reactions for specific detection of single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) remains a challenge. We develop a novel primer-activatable LAMP (PA-LAMP) strategy that enables highly specific and sensitive SNM detection using single-step, close-tube reactions. This strategy designs a terminal-blocked inner primer with a ribonucleotide insertion, which is cleaved and activated specifically to perfectly matched targets by ribonuclease (RNase) H2, to realize efficient amplification of mutant genes. It has shown dynamic responses of mutant target in a linear range from 220 aM to 22 pM with a lowest detectable concentration of 22 aM. It also demonstrates very high specificity in identifying the mutant in a large excess of the wild-type with a discrimination ratio as high as similar to 10,000. It has been successfully applied to mutation detection of genomic DNA in tumor cells. The PA-LAMP strategy provides a useful, portable and affordable POC platform for highly sensitive and specific detection of genetic mutations in clinical applications. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A biosensor that could simultaneously detect multi-analyte as many as in a single test is more favored when facing lots of samples for screening purpose. In such a biosensor, the recognition element with broad specificity and highly affinity is a key reagent for detection spectrum. Here we report a dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) based biosensor for detecting 29 sulfonamides (SAs) in milk. The biosensor was established in a competitive format where HRP-labeled tracer and free SAs competitively binding to the limited amount of DHPS-DHPPP (6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin diphosphate) binary complex. Compared to other biosensors based on antibodies with the same objective, the current sensor employing DHPS provided not only highly sensitivity but also preponderant uniform affinities for all individual sulfonamide, which has never been achieved before in any immunosensor. However, the difference of recognition mechanism between DHPS and antibody remains unknown. To address this question, we deconstructed the variable region of two monoclonal antibodies produced by our group and then compared the intermolecular forces and key contacting amino acid residues of both DHPS and antibodies to several typical SAs with help of molecular modeling analysis. Results showed the orientation of the ligands in the binding site played a significant role during the recognition with proteins. The optimized assay provided a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.15-14.91 ngmL(-1) and dynamic range was ranging from 1.54 to 126.85 ng mL(-1) for 29 SAs. The developed biosensor finally was validated for five SAs in spiked milk with recovery values ranging from 72.7 to 129.3% and coefficients of variation less than 16.0%. The study showed that the biosensor based on DHPS make it a suitable screening method for the simultaneous determination of total SAs residues in food matrices. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Isomers discrimination plays a vital role in modern chemistry, and development of efficient and rapid method to achieve this aim has attracted a great deal of interest. In this work, a novel carbon dot-decorated chiral porous organic cage hybrid nanocomposite (CD@RCC3) was prepared and used to fabricate fluorescent sensor. The resultant CD@RCC3 was characterized by using a range of techniques, finding that CD@RCC3 possesses strong and stable fluorescent property in common organic solvents, especially it exhibits chiral property. The potential application of CD@RCC3 in fluorescence sensing was demonstrated by isomers discrimination. The designed sensor was successfully used to rapid discriminate nitrophenol isomers. Meanwhile, it exhibited differentiation ability towards phenylalaninol and phenylethanol enantiomers. Our work enriches the type of synthetic materials for fluorescence sensing, and provides a simple method for distinguishing structural isomers and chiral isomers. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) platform for the simple and robust detection of platinum is described for the first time. Compared with conventional qPCR, a helper template, which is related to the active template for performing qPCR, was introduced in our helper qPCR system. Several guanine (G) bases were introduced in the helper template to obtain a platinum-responsive on/off switch based on G-Pt-G coordination. Because of the helper template, a slight change in platinum concentration would significantly change the signal in the qPCR. This novel helper qPCR technique easily detects platinum with high sensitivity (1 ng/mL) and selectivity over other metal ions. Therefore, it will be a promising technique for the detection of platinum in biomedical and environmental samples. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microplastics (MPs) pollution in marine systems is attracting worldwide attentions, which highlights a pressing need for efficient detection methods. Traditional protocols generally identify the suspected particles individually, which are time-consuming. Hyperspectral imaging technique has emerged as a simple and rapid method to characterize MPs in seawater. However, hyperspectral image consists of amount of redundant and high correlated spectral information, resulting in the Hughes phenomenon for classification. This work aimed to identify MPs from the hyperspectral image using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, which presents a good performance for analyzing nonlinear and highdimensional data and is insensitive to the Hughes effect. In this work, SVM was performed to quantify and identify MPs in both of seawater and seawater filtrates. The factors which may affect the accuracy of SVM model were investigated, including organic particles, polymer types and particle sizes. SVM model yielded a satisfactory accuracy for all the tested pure polymers and it presented a highly robust for detecting MPs in a wide range of types and particle sizes. Finally, common household polymers were chosen to validate the developed model. The results illustrate that hyperspectral imaging technology combination with SVM method exhibits a high robustness and recovery rate for MPs detection. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Analytical nanometrology is a present challenge in today's analytical science, particularly from a practical point of view and when it is addressed to routine/control laboratories. In this way, a screening-confirmation approach is described for the characterization and distinction between titanium dioxide nano/micro-particles in sugary food samples. The first step involves the confirmation of the presence of TiO2 in the sample (used as additive E171 in sugary samples), using a portable Raman spectrometer, in which the crystalline structure of TiO2 (anatase or rutile) in the positive samples can be also obtained in this step. Then, the second step was only applied to positive samples, and it involves the use of Capillary Electrophoresis (CE), which allows to distinguish between TiO2-nanoparticles (< 100 nm) from TiO2microparticles (> 100 nm). Additionally, nanoparticles (TiO2 anatase (5 nm diameter) and TiO2 rutile (60 nm diameter) and rutile microparticles (0.1-0.2 mm diameter) can be electrophoretically separated. The general procedure is simple, fast, and low cost, providing a valuable analytical tool in the field of food safety and control, thus contributing to the development of the analytical nanometrology.

AB The high proportion of acetonitrile used in many HILIC mobile phases significantly changes the acid-base properties of pH buffers and analytes foreseen from available data in water. In this paper, the recommended stability pH range for chromatographic columns is examined with various acetonitrile/water mixtures, resulting in a significant broadening in the operational pH window with the content of organic solvent. Additionally, the challenge of buffer selection in HILIC is also addressed. Commonly used ammonium acetate shrinks its pH buffering range in acetonitrile-rich mobile phases due to variations in the dissociation constants of the buffer constituents (acetic acid and ammonium). Thus, other organic acids such as formic acid, TFA, and succinimide have been studied as buffers in order to fully cover the pH range of use of the column. Also the retention-pH profiles of several acids and bases have been studied in 80% and 90% acetonitrile using the proposed buffers and their behavior compared to that obtained with buffers prepared from oxalic acid, pyrrolidine, and triethylamine. The latter two show additional interactions in 80% acetonitrile that distort the expected retention-pH profiles of acid analytes, but not the ones of bases. In 90% acetonitrile the profiles are affected by significant additional solute-buffer interactions that might be caused by ion pairing, homo-and heteroassociation in this low ion solvating medium.

AB A simple and cheap design for interfacing thin layer chromatography (TLC) with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) was developed to scan and characterize compounds on TLC plate. The developed TLC plate was rapidly and easily modified into two sawtooth-edged pieces that were positioned on an XYZ stage so that one of the triangular tips was pointed toward the MS inlet. A drop of methanol and high DC voltage was applied at the tip to induce ESI. After the analytes in the first tip were analyzed, the TLC piece was moved so that the second triangular tip was pointed toward the MS inlet for analysis. The process was repeated until all the triangular tips on the piece were analyzed. In this manner, the analytes, no matter visible or non-visible bands, were scanned and characterized. Since a 4.8 cm long TLC track were cut to 32 triangles on two sawtooth pieces for analysis, the spatial resolution of using the sawtooth TLC-ESI/MS for analysis is 1.5 mm/band. A mixture of dye standards and Datura metel flower extract was analyzed to demonstrate the capability of sawtooth TLC-ESI/MS on scanning and characterizing chemical compounds on the TLC plates. The limits of detection of the dye standards were between 0.25 and 2.5 ng/band. TLC bands containing alkaloids such as scopolamine and norscopolamine from the Datura metel flower extract were not visualized on the developed TLC track, but were successfully detected at different triangular tips using sawtooth TLC-ESI/MS. Based on these results, the R-f values of scopolamine and norscopolamine were determined. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Haptens (i.e. biomolecules which molecular weight is lower than 10 kDa) determination by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is usually performed by means of competitive immuno-assays. In these immunoassays, analyte quantification is indirectly carried out using two different tracer species (i.e. antibodies or antigen-protein conjugates). However, the benefits (and drawbacks) derived from using a given tracer species have not been systematically investigated so far. The goal of this work is to evaluate the influence of the tracer species employed in competitive immunoassays on the analytical figures of merit for aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)) determination in milk samples. To this end, three different strategies have been developed and evaluated, namely: (i) antibody binding inhibition assay (ABIA); (ii) capture inhibition assay (CIA); and (iii) capture bridge inhibition assay (CBIA). Experimental results show that the use of the antibody as tracer species (as in the ABIA approach) affords better analytical figures of merit for AFM(1) determination than using the antigen-protein conjugate as the tracer one (as in the CIA and CBIA strategies). The limit of detection afforded by ABIA strategy (i.e. 0.1 ng kg(-1)) for AFM(1) determination was 1000-fold and 50-fold lower regarding the CIA and CBIA strategies, respectively. In the case of the ABIA approach, the characteristics of the metal nanoparticle label employed to detect the tracer species is critical on the analytical figures of merit. However, when the hapten-protein conjugates are used as tracer species, immunocomplex formation is severely hampered by steric effects caused by the protein moiety and, consequently, the characteristics of the metal nanoparticle label is not critical in the immunoassay performance. The different immunoassay strategies were successfully validated for AFM1 determination in milk samples using a certified reference material of whole milk powder (ERM-BD283) according to European Conformity guidelines for analytical methods of food contaminants and mycotoxins. Compared to ELISA, the immunoassay developed for AFM(1) determination in milk samples improve limits of detection up to 10-fold. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is advisable to monitor and regulate inorganic arsenic (iAs) in food and feedstuff. This work describes an update and validation of a method of selective hydride generation (HG) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for high-throughput screening of iAs content in seafood samples after microwave-assisted extraction with diluted nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. High concentration of HCl (8 M) for HG along with hydrogen peroxide in samples of a same concentration as used for extraction leads to a selective conversion of iAs to volatile arsine that is released and transported to the detector. A minor contribution from methylarsonate (approximate to 20% to iAs) was found, while HG from dimethylarsinate, trimethylarsine oxide is substantially suppressed (less than 1% to iAs). Methodology was applied to Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) TORT-3, DORM-3, DORM-4, DOLT-4, DOLT-5, PRON-1, SQID-1 and ERM-CE278k, in some of them iAs has been determined for the first time, and to various seaweed samples from a local store. The results were always compared with a reference method and selectivity of iAs determination was evaluated. An inter-laboratory reproducibility was tested by comparative analyses of six fish and four seaweed samples in three European laboratories, with good agreement of the results. The method of HG-ICP-MS is sensitive (limit of detection 2 mg kg(-1) iAs), well suited for screening of large number of samples and selective at iAs concentration levels at which maximum limits are expected to be set into EU legislation for marine samples.

   TITRATION
AB In many equilibrium systems, it is customary to use a simplified, apparent equilibrium reaction instead of the complete reaction model. The resulting apparent equilibrium constants are altered or controlled by changes of the chemical system, usually modifying the total concentration of auxiliary reagents, but the variation of other parameters such the intensity of light in photo-controlled reactions, types and concentration of solvents or composition of mixed solvents, the ionic strength of the chemical media, etc. is also possible. The main goal of this work is to propose a chemical equilibrium modelling based strategy to control the conditions governing equilibrium systems in order to tune the apparent constants. Indeed, by extracting the analytic relationship between the parameters of the complete model and apparent model, the magnitude of the apparent constant(s) can be predicted.
   At first, a basic strategy for calculating the tunable range of apparent constants of chemical equilibria is proposed. Next, three case studies for tuning the apparent constants are investigated in detail: inclusion complexes with cyclodextrin, aqueous micellar solutions for investigating the solvent effects and the boric acid/ Mannitol system that allows the tuning of the apparent protonation constant. In all examples tuning the apparent constant is possible by regulating the chemical composition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, aiming at exploiting the essential particularities of modulation excitation spectroscopy (MES) coupled to phase sensitive detection (PSD) and chemometrics, a data analysis procedure was implemented to analyze phase-resolved infrared (IR) data. The fundamental principle of the proceedings is the application of successive multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) resolutions to MES-PSD IR data. The applicability of the strategy was evaluated in several cases of simulated data considering the effect of spectral band overlapping and presence of noise. Outcomes related to data-processing are depicted in detail. As a proof of concept, the data resolution approach was validated by resolving an experimental real system related to the adsorption-desorption dynamic of oxalic acid on titanium dioxide by in situ IR spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. After data resolution, different oxalate species were assigned to each spectral band and information about the kinetics in terms of phase lag was obtained. In the light of the obtained results, this approach is rather appealing in other research fields, very helpful for the non-chemometric community and foresees manifold applications, specially, in catalytic system investigations.

AB There has been an extensive abuse of Gy's Formula during the entire history of applied TOS (Theory of Sampling), it being applied too liberally to almost any aggregate material conceivable for many material classes of extremely different compositions with significant (to large, or extreme) fragment size distribution heterogeneity, for example many types of municipal and industrial waste materials. This abuse regimen is for the most part characterized by lack of fundamental TOS competence and the historical context of Gy's formula. The present paper addresses important theoretical details of TOS, which become important as sampling rates increase at the conclusion of the full 'lot-to-analysis sampling pathway regarding finer details behind TOS' central equations linking sampling conditions to material heterogeneity characteristics allowing the estimation of Total Sampling Error (TSE) manifestations. We derive a new, complementary understanding of the two conceptual factors, y the grouping factor and, z, the segregation factor, intended to represent the local (increment scale) and long-range (increment to lotscale) heterogeneity aspects of lot materials, respectively. We contrast the standard TOS expose with the new formulation. While the phenomenological meaning and content of the new proposed factors (y and z) remains the same, their numerical values and bracketing limits are different with z now representing more realistic effects of liberation and segregation combined. This new formulation makes it easier to get a first comprehensive grasp of TOS' dealings with sampling of significantly heterogeneous materials. We believe this may present a slightly easier path into the core issues in TOS when sampling and sub-sampling gets closer to the final aliquot scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the reliable determination of progesterone (P4) in undiluted saliva making use of a disposable amperometric immunosensors implemented on low-cost and portable device/potentiostat constructed with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The immunosensor allows the fast (45 min), selective and sensitive determination (5 pgmL(-1) LOD) of P4 using amperometry in stirred solutions. The immunosensor was coupled to the COTS-based potentiostat and amperometry was made into drops of quiescent solutions. No significant differences were apparent between the analytical performance achieved with the immunosensor for P4 using both a conventional and the COST-based potentiostats. The practical applicability of the immunosensor coupled with the COTS-based potentiostat was demonstrated by determining the endogenous P4 content in different undiluted saliva samples with highly variable endogenous contents of the target hormone. The obtained results were in good agreement with those provided by the conventional ELISA methodology and with the contents reported in the literature for samples with similar characteristics. This validated the combined device for the reliable and minimally invasive determination of the target hormone involving a very simple protocol and taking only 45 min. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Electroactive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with large surface area and manipulatable structural properties show promise as a new type of signal probe for electrochemical biosensing application. In this work, an electroactive Ni-MOF, assembled by the redox-active ligands 4,4',4 ''-Tricarboxytriphenylamine (H(3)TCA), a triphenylamine derivatives, as the electroactive source and magnetic ordered Ni4O4 clusters as electronic transport nodes, is first designed and applied for electrochemical aptasensing of thrombin (Tb). The designed Ni-MOF probe realizes a stable and sensitive electrochemical signal output based on simple sandwich-type aptasensing because the high-content TCA active sites and good magnetic ordered intermediate of Ni4O4 clusters are periodically arranged in well-defined porous structure of the MOF. The Ni-MOF probe assembled by redox-active ligand presents the high stability and can be directly applied in electrochemical aptasensor, avoiding any post-modification and the addition of redox mediators. As a result, the constructed electrochemical aptasensor shows a wide linear relationship for Tb from 0.05 pM to 50 nM and a detection limit of 0.016 pM (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the proposed aptasensor is successfully applied to analysis of target Tb in real serum sample with satisfactory results. The present work indicates that fabricating a redox-active organic molecule in functionalized MOFs offer a feasible strategy to design high-stable electroactive MOFs for construction of electrochemical biosensors with simplicity, high selectivity and sensitivity.

AB In this study, a novel and simple electrochemical sensor (ECS) was fabricated based on super pure single-walled carbon nanotubes (spSWCNTs) modified electrode. The ECS exhibited superior catalytic performance on the electrochemical reduction of olaquindox. A series of experimental parameters were systematically optimized to achieve optimal ECS performance. Compared with the bare gold electrode, the peak current increased 1700 times under the optimal experimental conditions. The ECS exhibited excellent sensitivity for the determination of trace olaquindox. The current response of the modified electrode was linear to the olaquindox concentration in the range of 0.1-500 nM with a detection limit of 30.0 pM (S/N = 3). The ECS was successfully applied for electrochemical recognition of olaquindox in real samples. In addition, the spSWCNTs modified electrode also exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic property in a wide potential range, so it had great potential for sensitive detection of various electroactive compounds.

AB In this work, we designed an integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) analytical system with photovoltage-regulated electrochromic tablet for visualized sensing. The electrochromic tablet consisted of electron-injector (EI) part and colorimetric system, which was functionalized with dye-sensitized titanium dioxide and nickel oxide nanosheet film as the recognition element and signal readout, respectively. Under irradiation of home-built white light, the EI part provided sufficient and stable photovoltage and injected the photoexcited electrons to nickel oxide nanosheet through the conductive inner side of indium tin oxide slide. Thus, the different color states of nickel oxide nanosheet were observed, resulting in a detectable signal by naked eyes for visual analysis. More importantly, the color change was identified to be dependent on the photovoltages generated from EI part. Using copper ions as a model analyte, the electrochromic tablet was successfully applied to visually detect copper ions based on its quenching effect on photovoltage due to the formation of exciton trapping. As a result, the copper ions could be simultaneously determined over a wide range through photovoltage record, average RGB value, and naked eyes. Furthermore, the device exhibited considerable stability and could be reused through simple washing steps. The smart tablet PEC system provides a new avenue to design practical PEC sensor in point-of-care diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, tuning polyelectrolyte-graphene interaction was demonstrated to enhance electrocatalytic activity for non-enzymatic hydrogen peroxide detection. The introduction of positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) onto graphene surface not only prevent the aggregation of graphene sheets through electrostatic repulsion but also create net positive charge on adjacent carbon atoms in the graphene due to the occurrence of the intermolecular charge transfer by virtue of the robust electron-withdrawing ability of PDDA. Notably, we revealed the influence of the adsorbed polyelectrolytes on the redox of H2O2 and the related mechanism was discussed in detail. In a word, the catalytic activities of the graphene could be effectively tuned via the induction of the polyelectrolytes with different attributes. It was expected that this finding could be favorable for the tuning graphene electronic structure and further developing the novel graphene-based electrochemical sensing platforms.

AB In this study, a novel two dimensional liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS) method with use of a weak anion exchange column between the 1st DLC RP column and the 2nd DLC RP column (RP1-WAX-RP2) was developed and applied to identify drug impurities from MS incompatible mobile phases containing sodium 1-octanesulfonate and non-volatile buffer. The 1st DLC conditions follow exactly the original standard HPLC method recorded in Chinese Pharmacopeia (ChP), European Pharmacopeia (EP) or US Pharmacopeia (USP). An impurity fraction was collected with a built-in sample loop (100 mu L) and transferred to the WAX column where 1-octanesulfonate and phosphate were trapped and removed. While, the impurity and other cations were eluted to the 2nd D column (RP2) for separation and identification by connected IT-TOF MS. Methods were programmed and applied to identify impurities in two generic drugs, sulpiride (hydrophilic drug with logP 0.57) and dobutamine (hydrophobic drug with logP 3.6). The results indicate that the methods based on RP1-WAX-RP2 column configuration offer a feasible solution for direct impurity identification in generic drug product or API without needs of off-line desalting from the MS incompatible mobile phases containing ion-pairing reagent and nonvolatile buffer.

AB Nucleosides and their analogues play a crucial role in the treatment of several diseases including cancers and viral infections. Their therapeutic efficiency depends on their capacity to be converted to the active nucleoside triphosphates form through successive phosphorylation steps catalyzed by nucleoside/nucleotide kinases. It is thus mandatory to develop an easy, rapid, reliable and sensitive enzyme activity tests. In this study, we monitored the three-step phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine triphosphate respectively by (1) human thymidine kinase 1 (hTK1), (2) human thymidylate kinase (hTMPK) and (3) human nucleoside diphosphate kinase (hNDPK). Free and immobilized kinase activities were characterized by using the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model. Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) with High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) was used as well as capillary electrophoresis (CE) with UV detection. The three-step cascade phosphorylation of thymidine was also monitored. FIA-HRMS allows a sensitive and rapid evaluation of the phosphorylation process.

AB The human exposure to perfluoroalkyl (PFASs) and organophosphorus (OPs) compounds is a cause of concern and its determination in biological matrices, including human milk, is an emergent approach for evaluate their exposure. A comprehensive strategy for the quantitative determination of 21 PFASs and OPs compounds in breast milk was developed. The proposed method includes an extraction and clean-up procedure based on the QuEChERs methodology followed by an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) determination. The full-scan mass data were acquired with a resolution of 50000 FWHM and a mass accuracy better than 5 ppm.
   Method validation was performed in terms of recovery, repeatability, linearity and limit of quantification. The obtained recoveries varied between 70 and 120% with a precision (RSD) lower than 25%. The limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged between 1.9 and 19.0 ng g(-1) lipid weight for OPs, and between 0.066 ng mL(-1) and 0.666 ng mL(-1) for PFASs. A breast milk reference material was used in order to check the validated method.
   The developed analytical strategy was applied to 20 breast milk samples collected from mothers living in the Valencian Region (Spain). All of the OPs analyzed except tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were detected in at least one sample. In all samples, perfluoro-n-pentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluoro-n-octanoic acid (PFOA) and sodium perfluoro-1-octanesulfonate (PFOS) were the most frequently detected analytes. Concentration of total OPs (Sigma OPs) and total PFASs (Sigma PFASs) ranged from 1.9 to 37.7 ng g(-1) lipid weight and from 0.066 to 0.356 ng mL(-1), respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) is an effective technique that can be used to selectively enrich trace analytes of interest from complex samples. Owing to its high sensitivity and high selectivity, mass spectrometry (MS) has been widely used as the detection tool to confirm the analytes enriched on SPME fibers. Generally, thermal desorption or solvent desorption is used to desorb analytes from SPME fibers for MS analysis. A straightforward ionization method called carbon fiber ionization (CFI), which uses a single carbon fiber (diameter: similar to 10 mu m) as ionization emitter in MS, has been demonstrated lately. Analytes adsorbed on the carbon fiber, which is placed close (similar to 5 mm) to the inlet of a mass spectrometer, can be readily ionized through corona discharge and detected by the mass spectrometer. One unique feature regarding this approach over other existing ambient ionization methods is that no additional electric contact is applied directly on the carbon fiber. Nevertheless, on the basis of the electric field provided by the mass spectrometer, corona discharge can readily occur for ionizing analytes on the carbon fiber. Carbon fiber has high affinity toward polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to its graphite-like surface structure. We herein explore a hyphenated-technique by combining carbon-fiber based SPME with CFI-MS for extraction of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a carcinogen, from aqueous samples. After BaP are adsorbed on a carbon fiber through SPME, the SPME carbon fiber can be readily placed in front of the mass spectrometer for MS analysis. The ions at m/z 252 derived from BaP adsorbed on the carbon fiber can be immediately acquired by the mass spectrometer without the requirement of applying heating or solvent. The limit of detection of BaP using the developed method was as low as similar to 60 pM. It is also feasible to detect BaP from complex serum sample. The feasibility of using the approach for quantitative analysis of BaP was also demonstrated. The linear dynamic range toward BaP was 0.2-5 nM. The extraction efficiency using this approach for aqueous samples was similar to 91%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plasticizers and other plastics additives have been extensively used as ingredients of plastics and are as a result thereof easily released in the aquatic environment, due to different physical diffusion processes. In this context, a dedicated method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of 27 known and a virtually unlimited number of unknown alkylphenols, Bisphenol A and phthalates in 2 aquatic matrices, i.e. sea-and freshwater. To this extent, a novel instrumental HESI-UHPLC-HRMS (heated electro-spray ionization ultra-high performance liquid chromatographic high resolution mass spectrometric) method was devised for the simultaneous analysis of 7 phenols (i.e. 6 alkylphenols and Bisphenol A) and 20 phthalates within 10 min. Thereafter, a solid-phase extraction protocol was statistically (95% confidence interval, p > 0.05) optimized based on experimental designs. The method was proven fit-for-purpose through a successful validation at environmentally relevant nanomolar concentrations. Analytical precautions were taken for minimizing false-positive results to suppress in-house contamination. The method demonstrated an excellent analytical performance across all known plasticizers and plastics additives for sea-and freshwater, revealing good linearity (R-2 > 0.99, n = 39), stable recoveries (98.5-105.8%), satisfactory repeatability (RSD < 8%, n = 54) and reproducibility (RSD < 10%, n = 36). Subsequently, a novel analytical strategy was devised for the tentative identification of unknown plasticizers and plastics additives using specific in-house determined fragments incorporated in a Python code. The applicability of the analytical platform was demonstrated by measuring 24 seawater samples. Interestingly, 16 out of 27 known plasticizers, plastics additives and primary metabolites could be quantified while the untargeted analysis uncovered 1042 compounds, whereof 5% (n = 46) could be assigned a plasticizer-plastics additive chemical identity, providing evidence for the severe plastic contamination status of our marine environment.

AB Time-gated luminescence (TGL) bioassay technique using luminescent lanthanide complexes as probes has exhibited excellent practicability in detection of various analytes in autofluorescence-rich biosamples. Herein, a novel copper(II)-coupled lanthanide complex-based luminescence probe has been developed for the ratiometric TGL detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in vitro and in vivo. The probe is constructed based on a dual-functional ligand that was synthesized by conjugating di(2-picolyl)amine with terpyridine polyacid (DATP) using the "click chemistry" method. The as-prepared ligand can coordinate to Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions with its terpyridine polyacid moiety to display long-lived emissions of Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions, while the further coordination of its di(2-picolyl)amino moiety to Cu2+ induces to the luminescence quenching of the Eu3+ complexes, which allows the probe consisting of the heterometallic Cu2+-DATP-Eu3+/Tb3+ complexes to be constructed. After the probe was reacted with H2S to lead to the release of Cu2+ from the complexes, the emission of Eu3+ at 610 nm was remarkably enhanced, while that of Tb3+ at 540 nm was changed slightly. This luminescence response feature allowed the probe to be conveniently applied for the ratiometric TGL determination of H2S with I-610/I-540 as the signal. The applicability of the probe for quantitative detection of H2S in human sera as well as for imaging of H2S in living cells and zebrafish were evaluated. All of the results proved the potential of the probe for in vitro and in vivo applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forensic laboratories commonly receive new psychoactive substances such as fentanyl analogues and other synthetic opioids that are difficult to identify. Slight changes to chemical structures, e.g. shifting the position of functional groups such as methyl groups or halogens on the aromatic ring, may not be distinguished using traditional methods. NMR is a powerful tool used to elucidate distinctive structural information needed to differentiate regioisomers. However, the cost, size, and cryogen maintenance of superconducting NMR spectrometers can be impractical for some forensic laboratories. Recent studies have shown potential applications of low-field NMR as an alternative in forensic drug analysis. These benchtop, semi-portable instruments are less costly, have a smaller footprint, do not use cryogens, and require little maintenance. In this study, we show that 65 fentanyl and related substances, including various types of positional isomers, were readily differentiated using low-field (62 MHz) H-1 NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the use of quantum mechanical spin system analysis was investigated for the purposes of translating experimentally observed high-field 1H spectra to lower field strengths. Spin system analysis of 600 MHz NMR spectra was conducted on a subset (15) of the reference materials analyzed. The results were used to calculate 62 MHz spectra for comparison purposes with the experimental spectra. This was successfully demonstrated, showing that field-strength independent 1H NMR spectral libraries are feasible and can facilitate reference material data dissemination across forensic drug laboratories.

AB In the present work, highly sensitive Raman detection of nitenpyram using superhydrophobic filter paper as substrates is introduced. The process is simple, and efficient. By sequentially coating silver dendrites and Octyltrimethoxysilane (OTMOS) on filter paper, we produced highly active surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates which show advancing and receding water contact angles of theta(A)/theta(R) = 159 degrees/156 degrees. Nitenpyram, a type of pesticides popularly used in agriculture, can be easily detected with the detection limit as low as 1 nM using the superhydrophobic filter paper as SERS substrates, which validates their use in Raman applications.

AB Thiocyanate level in the human system can serve as a biomarker to distinguish smokers from nonsmokers. Thiocyanate is a potential goitrogen, thus an accurate determination may help to identify lactating mothers with high thiocyanate dosage, thereby preventing the transport of excess SCN- to infants. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy has become a versatile and reliable technique to detect SCN- in different media. However, the conventional surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates used to detect SCN- are often discarded after use. The frequent disposal of such metal nanoparticles is detrimental to the environment and makes the SERS-based detection of SCN- uneconomical. In this study, we present fabrication of a new, ultrasensitive and recyclable SERS substrate, based on an Au-SiO2@Ag wire (W) superstructure, to detect SCN- in different media. The hierarchical Au-SiO2@AgW substrate was obtained by forming nano-sized patches of SiO2 on micron-sized AgW and anchoring 30 nm-sized gold nanoparticles on the patches with mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. This ultrasensitive substrate could detect SCN- at a low concentration of 0.001 mu M in water, and 0.01 mu M in urine and human serum. In addition, a facile procedure to regenerate and recycle the SCN- bound Au-SiO2@AgW platform in different media has been demonstrated. The insight gained in the present study can serve as a promising and powerful method for fabrication of active and recyclable substrates for SERS-based detection of SCN-. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB An electrochemical immunosensor for ultrasensitive detection of acrylamide (AA) in water and food samples was developed. SnO2-SiC hollow sphere nanochains with high surface area and gold nano-particles with good electroconductivity were fabricated onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode pre-coated with chitosan. The coating antigen (AA-4-mercaptophenylacetic acid-ovalbumin conjugate, AA-4-MPA-OVA) was immobilized on the electrode. Polyclonal antibody specific for AA-4-MPA was conjugated to gold nanorod (AuNR) as primary antibody (AuNR-Ab(1)). Horseradish peroxidase labelled anti-rabbit antibody produced in goat was conjugated to AuNR as secondary antibody (HRP-AuNR-Ab(2)). For detection, the analyte (AA-4-MPA) in sample competed with coating antigen for binding with AuNR-Ab1. After washing, HRP-AuNR-Ab(2) was added to capture the AuNR-Ab(1), and the electrical signal was obtained by addition of hydroquinone and H2O2. After investigation of the binding ability on nanomaterials and optimization of competitive immunoassay conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a sensitive response to AA with a detection limit of 45.9 +/- 2.7 ng kg(-1), and working range of 187 +/- 12.3 ng kg(-1) to 104 +/- 8.2 mu g kg(-1) for drinking water samples. Recoveries of AA from spiked samples were ranged from 86.0% to 115.0%. The specificity, repeatability and stability of the immunosensor were also proved to be acceptable, indicating its potential application in AA monitoring. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel bifunctional thiophene-based Schiff base TS as a colorimetric and fluorescent turn-on sensor for rapid and simultaneous detection of Al3+ and Zn2+ ions with high selectivity and sensitivity has been developed. The sensor shows remarkable fluorescence enhancement response for Al3+ and Zn2+ over a broad pH range with good anti-interference capability, which accompanied with an obvious color change easily detected by naked eyes. Sensor TS can detect as low as 3.7 x 10(-9) M for Al3+ and 3.0 x 10(-8) M for Zn2+, whereas respective association constants are 1.16 x 10(4) M-1 and 2.08 x 10(4) M-1. With the help of fluorescence titration and Job's plot, the stoichiometric ratio of TS with Al3+/Zn2+ was determined to be 1:1. The sensing mechanism of sensor TS with Al3+/Zn2+ based on the chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) was analyzed in detail through H-1 NMR titration, FTIR, HRMS and DFT studies. Moreover, sensor TS has been applied to the detection of Al3+ and Zn2+ in real environmental water and food samples as well as the filter paper-based test strips. Furthermore, sensor TS has good cell-permeability and can be used to selectively sense intracellular Al3+ and Zn2+ by bioimaging. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantitative detection of multiple chicken cytokines is a good evaluation of cell-mediated immunity in chickens after disease infection or vaccination. However, current assay methods for chicken cytokines cannot meet the needs of clinical diagnosis due to unsatisfactory sensitivity and low assay throughput. Herein, a sensitive chemiluminescence (CL) imaging immunosensor array has been developed for high-throughput detection of multiple chicken cytokines. The chicken cytokines immunosensor array was prepared by assembling different cytokine capture antibodies onto a disposable silanized glass chip, where horseradish peroxidase and antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles were used as multienzymatic amplification probe for CL imaging signal amplification. By using a sandwich assay mode, the amplified CL signals from each sensing array cell were collected for quantitation. Using chicken interleukin-4 and chicken interferon-gamma as model cytokines, this novel multiplexed and amplified method demonstrated simultaneous measurement of the two chicken cytokines in the linear ranges of 0.008-0.12 ng/mL and 0.005-0.20 ng/mL, respectively, which yields limits of detection down to 2 pg/mL and 3 pg/mL. The CL imaging array method reported here also demonstrated high specificity, good repeatability, and high stability and accuracy, providing a novel multiplex immunoassay strategy for highly sensitive and high-throughput detection of chicken cytokines and further disease diagnosis in poultry.

AB In this work, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were prepared with vinyl-coated magnetic particles (Fe3O4@VTEO) as the support material, deep eutectic solvent (DES) based on vinyl as the functional monomer, respectively. N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAAm) was used as the crosslinker on account of its abundant carbon-carbon double bonds. The MIPs were prepared with the addition of bovine hemoglobin (BHb) acted as the template. The MIPs particles can be collected quickly by a magnetic field. The composition and morphology of the MIPs particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to illustrate the cubic inverse spinel structure of Fe3O4. Meanwhile, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) was applied to characterize the magnetism of the MIPs. Adsorption experiments were performed to attain the optimum adsorption conditions. Under the optimized conditions, the obtained maximum adsorption capacity (Q, mg.g(-1)) of the MIPs particles is found to be 164.20 mg g(-1), and the imprinting factor (IF) is 4.93. Four reference molecules were used to test the selectivity of the MIPs particles, which indicates that the recognition sites can adsorb template molecules with selectivity. Furthermore, the prepared magnetic MIPs particles were applied to capture BHb from the real samples (calf blood) effectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In amperometric gas sensors, the flux of gas to electrode surfaces determines the analytical response and detection limit. For trace concentration detection, the resulting low current prevents the miniaturisation of such sensors. Therefore, in this study, we have developed repeating arrays of nanostructures which maximise flux towards their surface. Unique platinum 3D cauliflower-shaped deposits with individual floret-shaped segments have been produced in a single step electrodeposition process. The confined walls of recessed microelectrode arrays (10 mu m in diameter, 90 electrodes) are utilized to produce these structures with a high surface area. Distinct segments are observed, with the gaps corresponding to electrodes adjacent in the microarray; thus the majority of the deposits face the primary diffusion zones. The sizes and shapes of the deposits are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the largest structures are found to be 22 +/- 1 mu m in width and 7.9 +/- 0.2 mu m in height over the microhole. These modified electrodes are employed to detect ammonia using the room temperature ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, [C(2)mim][NTf2], as an electrolyte. Current responses on the cauliflower arrays were seven times higher for linear sweep voltammetry and ca. 12 times higher for chronoamperometry, relative to the bare microrrays, and limits of detection were less than 1 part per million of ammonia (gas phase concentration). This work highlights the use of modified microarrays with highly accessible 3D structures for enhanced electroanalytical detection of analyte species at ultra low concentrations.

AB The development of a methodology for the determination of Se(IV) concentration via cathodic stripping voltammetry is described in this work. The methodology is based on the formation of copper selenide (Cu2Se), whose reduction signal at -0.60 V has been used as an analytical response to quantify the Se(IV) concentration in solution. The novelty of our methodology is the study of this system in the presence of a ligand such as ammonium diethyl dithiophosphate (ADTTP), which forms complexes with Cu(II) and Se(IV). The results showed that the presence of ADTTP plays an important role, increasing the sensitivity of the determination by almost a factor of two compared with the methodology in the absence of the ligand. The optimized conditions were pH 1.6 (phosphoric acid, 2.0 x 10(-2) mol L-1), C-Cu(II) = 1.5 mg L-1, C-ADTTP = 2.0 mu mol L-1, E-acc = -0.40 V and t(acc) = 45 s. The detection and the quantification limits obtained were 0.065 and 0.21 mu g L-1, respectively, and linearity was maintained up to 4.0 mu g L-1 of Se(IV). The sensitivity was 10.26 nA L mu g(-1). On the other hand, the relative standard deviation for 15 replicate measurements at 1.0 mu g L-1 of Se(IV) was 1.6%. The usefulness of the method was evaluated by determining Se(IV) in two certified reference materials (TMDW and TM-28.4) with relative errors of less than 2.0%. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of Se(IV) in spiked tap water and in a liquid pharmaceutical formulation with satisfactory results.
   The developed methodology presents a low detection limit, good repeatability, selectivity and linear range. Furthermore, the sensibility of the method was achieved by applying a short accumulation time (45 s). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An impedimetric human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA biosensor based on gold nanotubes (AuNTs) in label free detection was materialized. The AuNTs decorated nanoporous polycarbonate (AuNTs-PC) template as biosensor electrode was fabricated by electrodeposition method. The single strand DNA (ss-DNA) probe was covalently immobilized onto the AuNTs-PC electrode. The hybridization of target sequences with the ss-DNA probe was observed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The biosensor showed high selectivity and could differentiate between the complementary, mismatch and non-complementary DNA sequences. The EIS measurements were matched to Randle's equivalent circuit. The negatively-charged HPV DNA oligonucleotides under external electric field were oriented in a preferred direction and the bio-sensing responses were intensified by controlling the immobilization and hybridization of the sequences on the AuNTs surface. The fabricated DNA biosensor under electric field amplification was stable up to six weeks and demonstrated 97% of its initial detection responses. The biosensor displayed the HPV DNA hybridization detection in very low concentrations in the linear response ranges of 0.01 pM -1 mu M and was able to acquire a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 fM.

AB A novel enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) DNA biosensor, based on a compact heterojunction g-C3N4/MoS2 and co-sensitization effect with CdSe quantum dots (QDs), was first proposed for simple and accurate analysis of a short ssDNA. In this work, the g-C3N4/MoS2 was successfully synthesized and used as the electrode matrix material to construct PEC biosensor. 2D/2D heterojunction was formed between g-C3N4 and MoS2, which could promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs resulting in an enhanced photocurrent. In the presence of target DNA, CdSe QDs labeled reporter DNA was complementary pairing with target DNA which was specific recognized by capture DNA loading on self-assembled CdS QDs film, leading to close contact between CdSe QDs and g-C3N4/MoS2 modified electrode surface, thereby resulting in the enhanced photocurrent intensity due to the co-sensitization effect. Under the optimal operating conditions, the photoelectrochemical biosensor demonstrated favorable accuracy and could respond to 0.32 pM (S/N = 3) with a linear concentration range from 1.0 pM to 2.0 mu M. Moreover, the proposed PEC DNA biosensor exhibits high sensitivity, excellent specificity, acceptable reproducibility and accuracy, showing a promising potential in DNA bioanalysis and other relative fields.

AB A competitive immunosensor was established using an electrochemical amperometric strategy for sensitive detection of tetrabromobisphenol A bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (TBBPA-DHEE), an important derivative of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). In this system, the amplified electrochemical signal towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was recorded by amperometric method. Meanwhile, the synthetized catalase functionalized AuNPs-loaded self-assembled polymer nanospheres showed an excellent electrocatalytic ability to catalyse H2O2, which was beneficial for strengthening the electrochemical signals. Under the optimized conditions, this method displayed: (i) low detection limits (0.12 ng/mL, 7 times lower than the traditional ELISA with the same antibody); (ii) satisfactory accuracy (recoveries, 78-124%; RSD, 2.1-8.3%) and good agreement with the corresponding ELISA; (iii) low sample consumption (6 mu L) and low cost. The proposed approach was applied for investigation of TBBPA-DHEE from environmental waters, and our results indicated that this immunosensor has great potential to detect the trace pollutants in aquatic environments.

AB A dynamic two-phase micro-electromembrane extraction (mu-EME) using electrically induced transfer of charged analytes directly into free liquid membrane (FLM) is proposed as a novel technique for improving enrichment capabilities of mu-EME. The presented set-up employs aqueous sample as donor solution and water immiscible organic solvent (1-octanol) as FLM, which form the two-phase mu-EME system for efficient extraction of model acidic drugs (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen and diclofenac) from standard solutions, human urine, human serum and wastewater samples. The FLM eliminates migration of matrix components from the complex samples and simultaneously it acts as an acceptor solution for selective trapping and enrichment of the analyte ions. Electrodes are immersed directly into the sample and the FLM and replenishment of analyte ions at the sample/FLM phase interface is accomplished by stirring the sample solution using a conventional laboratory stirrer. At optimized two-phase mu-EME conditions (100 V, 15 min, 1000 rpm) and optimized volume ratio of sample to FLM (480:16 mu L), extraction recoveries of 60-97% and enrichment factors up to 29.1 were achieved. Determination of the acidic drugs in resulting FLMs was achieved by capillary electrophoresis with ultraviolet detection with good linearity (r(2) >= 0.9998) and low limits of detection (4-20 ng/mL).

AB In this study, two monophasic isopropanol-water mixtures (IPA:H2O 75:25 v/v and IPA: H2O 90:10 v/v) were compared with traditionally employed biphasic methods of Bligh & Dyer and Matyash et al. as extraction systems for lipidomics analysis in Hela cells. Samples were analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS in positive and negative mode using sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) and a relatively new software (MS-DIAL) was employed for the processing of the data which includes detection of peaks, MS/MS spectra deconvolution, identification of detected lipids and alignment of peaks through the analyzed samples.
   The studied performance parameters such as precision, recoveries of isotopically labeled internal standards and endogenous lipids, number of extracted lipids, and complexity of employed procedure showed that extraction with IPA:H2O 90:10 v/v performs similar to the Matyash protocol and better than Bligh & Dyer as well as IPA:H2O 75:25 v/v. However, less complex monophasic protocol which is simpler to implement and can be executed in plastic rather than glass, make the monophasic IPA:H2O 90:10 v/v protocol an excellent alternative to the classical biphasic protocols for reversed phase LC-MS lipidomics studies.

AB Multiplex detection of ultra-low abundant tumor markers is extremely important for early diagnosis and therapy evaluation. Herein, an ultrasensitive multiplex immunoassay was developed by combination of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and suspension bead array (SBA) technology. Based on a conventional sandwich-type immunoreaction on beads, the detection antibodies were conjugated with DNA primers, so RCA could be implemented to generate long-stranded DNA with abundant repeated sequences allowing for hybridization with fluorochrome-labeled oligonucleotide probes. Thus the fluorescence signal of immunocomplexes on the encoded beads can be greatly enhanced. Using the as-developed immuno-RCA suspension bead array (iRCA-SBA), simultaneous analysis of multiple tumor markers was achieved with the limits of detection of 3.1 pg/mL (similar to 0.1 pM) for prostate specific antigen (PSA), 9.1 pg/mL (similar to 50 fM) for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and 0.66 pg/mL (similar to 9 fM) for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which are two to three orders of magnitude lower than those obtained by the conventional SBA method. The dynamic range were 4.5, 4.7, and 5.5 orders of magnitude for PSA, CEA, and AFP, respectively. Tests on clinical serum samples demonstrate that the tumor marker concentrations measured by the newly developed iRCA-SBA assay agreed well with those obtained by the conventional SBA method. These results indicate that the iRCA-SBA assay significantly increased the detection sensitivity and dynamic range without sacrificing the reliability and accuracy of conventional SBA. Upon the integration with iRCA, SBA could find more applications in the detection of low abundance protein biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Study of the gas-phase decomposition of multiply lithiated

AB Collision-Induced Dissociation and Electron Transfer Dissociation experiments were carried out from various lithium adducts ([M+2Li](2+), [M+3Li](3+)) from polycaprolactone diol (pCL), polytetrahydrofurane (pTHF), and one triblock copolymer (pCL-pTHF-pCL). In both cases (pCL and pTHF), CID of triply lithiated precursors led to complex mass spectra compared to corresponding ETD spectra, which remained relatively simple because CID product ions exhibit multiple charge states whereas ETD mainly led to singly charged fragment ions. CID of pCL involves charge-remote rearrangements over the ester groups and intramolecular transesterification reactions, whereas ETD leads to radical and charge induced cleavages leading globally to structurally different product ions but accounting for the same bond cleavages: (CO)O-C and (CO)-O respectively. Both CID and ETD can produce a low amount of undesirable reactions such as consecutive fragmentations especially from 3+ precursors but these fragmentations are absent in ETD from 2+ species. CID of a triply lithiated pTHF involved charge-induced and charge-remote fragmentations. In contrast, under ETD conditions, in the absence of suitable chemical functionality, pTHF did not undergo any backbone fragmentations at all. Nevertheless, proton abstraction by the fluoranthene reagent anion allowed the formation of species that could further be collisionally activated, leading to a depolymerization process from the ends. This strategy combining sequentially ETD and CID led to dramatically simplified product ion spectra. Concerning the supposed triblock copolymer, which was commercially purchased, both CID and ETD led to the same conclusion that at least a part of the copolymer was a diblock rather a triblock.

AB Enzymatic O-18 exchange, the well-established approach in comparative proteomics, has some disadvantages such as back exchange of labeled oxygen and overlapping the peak of a labeled peptide with isotopic peaks of an unlabeled one. Herein we demonstrated a simple procedure in which samples digested with a trypsin (with and without (H2O)-O-18) were reacted with unlabeled and quadrupled C-13-labeled pyrylium salt respectively which results in formation of pyridinium cations. Thus, each isobarically labeled peptide containing zero or four C-13 atoms in the mass reporter group, during tandem MS/MS forms an unique reporter ion useful for a relative quantitation. Such a sample treatment improves the signal to noise ratio, reduces overlapping of the isotopic peaks and completely eliminates the back exchange problem. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sensitive glycomics analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is of great importance but significantly hampered by their low ionization efficiency and labile sialic acid moieties. Chemical derivatization offers a viable way to improve both the ionization efficiency and analytical sensitivity of the glycans in MS analysis by altering their hydrophobicity or charge property. Here we employed Girard's reagent T (GT) for on-target derivatization (GTOD) of reducing glycan under mild acid condition to form stable hydrazones at room temperature, allowing rapid and sensitive identification of neutral and sialylated glycans in positive-ion mode as only permanently positive charged molecular ions without multiple ion adducts by MALDI-TOF-MS. The MS signal intensities of lactose, sialylated N-glycans derived from bovine fetuin and neutral N-glycans derived from RNaseB and ovalbumin were boosted by 7.44, 9.13, 12.96 and 13.47 folds on average (n = 3), respectively. More importantly, after GTOD strategy, unwanted desialylation of sialylated glycans during MS was suppressed. The detection limit of the assay is desirable since the nanogram of N-glycans derived from 0.16 mu g ovalbumin could be detected. The assay demonstrated good stability (RSD <= 2.95%, within 10 days), reliable reproducibility (RSD = 2.96%, n = 7) and a desirable linear dynamic range from 78 nmol/mL to 10 mmol/mL. The strategy has been successfully applied to MS analysis of reducing glycans from human milks, neutral and sialylated O-, N-glycans from glycoproteins, and reducing glycans derived from glycosphingolipids, presenting neater [M](+) signals which allow detection of more low-abundance glycans and assignation of Neu5Ac vs. Neu5Gc or fucose vs. hexose in glycans due to the absence of the ambiguous interpretation from multiple peaks (ion adducts [M+Na](+) and [M+K](+)). Moreover, the GTOD assay prevents desialylation during MALDI-TOF-MS profiling and enables distinct linkage-specific characterization of terminal sialic acids of N-glycans derived from human serum protein when combines with an esterification.

AB It is difficult to conduct rapid quantitative studies by direct analysis of mass spectrometry because of the matrix effects. In order to overcome the matrix effects in rapid quantitative analysis of complex sample and to find a rapid mass spectrometry method for capsaicin quantitation, the thermal desorption carbon fiber ionization mass spectrometry (TD-CFI-MS) was developed and optimized. TD-CFI-MS allows timesaving, less cost, less solvent consumption and no auxiliary gas. In this method the metal ceramics heater (MCH) was used for analyte desorption. The protonated water clusters in carbon fiber ion source provided proton for analytes through ion-molecular interactions. Desorption and ionization processes were separated in time and space so the analyte was less affected by the matrix during ionization, and the signal intensity of the analyte was enhanced. The matrix effects were investigated by the quantitative analysis of capsaicin in various samples using TD-CFI-MS, and the results were within 93.3-97.6% which indicated that almost no significant effects on the quantitation of capsaicin by this method. Finally, TD-CFI-MS was successfully applied for the quantitation of capsaicin in various real samples including foods and medicines indicating that this technique was a valuable strategy.

AB Experimental data for waveguide-coupled surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) cones generated from dielectric waveguides is presented. The results demonstrate a simpler route to collect plasmon waveguide resonance (i.e., PWR) data. In the reverse-Kretschmann configuration (illumination from the sample side) and Kretschmann configuration (illumination from the prism side), all the waveguide modes are excited simultaneously with p- or s-polarized incident light, which permits rapid acquisition of PWR data without the need to scan the incident angle or wavelength, in the former configuration. The concentric SPP cone properties depend on the thickness and index of refraction of the waveguide. The angular intensity pattern of the cone is well-matched to simulation results in the reverse-Kretschmann configuration, and is found to be dependent on the polarization of the incident light and the polarization of the waveguide mode. In the Kretschmann geometry, all waveguide-coupled SPP cones are measured at incident angles that produce attenuated light reflectivity. In addition, the enhanced electric field produced under total internal reflection allows high signal-to-noise ratio multimodal spectroscopies (e.g., Raman scattering, luminescence) to measure the chemical content of the waveguide film, which traditionally is not measured with PWR.

AB Microwave reactors with on-line controlled reaction conditions have been recently innovated to improve reaction kinetics and reproducibility. Herein, a modern microwave reactor was dedicated to develop a new, sensitive and reproducible approach for trace analysis of budesonide (BUD) in human plasma. The method was based on fast microwave reaction of BUD with dansyl hydrazine (DNS-HZ) reagent under controlled conditions coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fluorescence detection. The microwave irradiation and dansylation conditions were optimized for the best sensitivity and selectivity. The controlled microwave derivatization reaction (CMDR) decreased the reaction time, amplified the reaction yield and enhanced product purities by reducing the unwanted side reactions. The chromatographic separation was attained by isocratic elution on reversed phase column via a mobile phase consisted of methanol and phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0) at ratio 80: 20 (v/v). The fluorescence detector was set at 500 nm after excitation at 330 nm. Betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) was used as an internal standard. CMDR-HPLC method validation was performed in agreement with bioanalytical method validation guidelines by the US food and drug administration (US-FDA). The obtained linearity range was 0.2-100 ngmL(-1) with correlation coefficient 0.9991 and the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) in human plasma was 0.21 ngmL(-1). The developed CMDR-HPLC method was applied successfully for assessment of plasma levels of BUD in allergic rhinitis patients after intranasal administration of the micronized BUD.

AB Hypochloric acid (HClO) is mainly distributed in acidic lysosomes of phagocytes and closely associated with numerous physiological and pathological processes, especially inflammatory response. Fluorescent probe has become an important tool for imaging HClO in lysosomes, but suffered from interference from autofluorescence in vivo, phototoxicity to biosamples and photobleaching phenomenon due to their short-wavelength excitation and emission. Unfortunately, up to now, no near-infrared (NIR) lysosome-targetable fluorescent probe has been reported for imaging HClO. In this paper, a near-infrared fluorescent probe Lyso-NIR-HClO for imaging lysosomal HClO was reported for the first time. Lyso-NIR-HClO based on Si-rhodamine is consisted of a morpholine unit as a lysosome-targetable group and a HClO-mediated cyclization reaction site as a response group, which was applied for highly selective and sensitive detection and imaging for endogenous and exogenous HClO in lysosomes, with a linear range from 5.0 x 10(-8) to 1.0 x 10(-5) M and a detection limit of 2.0 x 10(-8) M in vitro. Attributed to NIR emission and excellent photostability of Si-rhodamine, Lyso-NIR-HClO exhibits excellent performances in vivo, such as low interference from intracellular autofluorescence, stable and persistent fluorescence signal and good tissue penetration, which are in favor of accurate, time-lapse and long-term imaging for HClO. Finally, we applied the probe Lyso-NIR-HClO to visualize endogenous HClO during lysosome-involved inflammatory response including bacteria-infected cells and inflamed mouse model with satisfactory results. The above results proved that Lyso-NIR-HClO would be a potentially useful tool for the study of biological functions and pathological roles of HClO in lysosomes, especially role of lysosome in the inflammatory response.

AB Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is one of the most common food-borne pathogens. The authors describe a sensitive and reliable multicolorimetric assay for L. monocytogenes using a sensing system based on TMB2+ etching of gold nanorods. Apt-MNP was used as the capture probe, and IgY-BSA-MnO2 NPs was chosen as an oxidase-like nano-artificial enzyme to oxidize TMB to generate TMB2+. Under the optimized conditions, the longitudinal shift of localized surface plasmon resonances had a linear correlation with the L. monocytogenes concentration in the range between 10 to 10(6) cfu mL(-1). Meanwhile, the sensing system can generate vivid color responses as colorful as a rainbow, and the limit of detection is as low as 10 cfu mL(-1) at a glance. Recoveries ranging from 97.4 to 101.3% are found when analyzing spiked food samples without pre-enrichment. In our perception, it shows promise in rapid instrumental and on-site visual detection of L. monocytogenes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, an original exciton energy transfer-based sensitive fluorescence sensor for the determination of Hg2+ has been designed through DNA aptamer-programmed self-assembly of CdTe quantum dots (QDs). In this work, CdTe QDs were applied as fluorescence signal source. The two pieces of T-rich aptamer played a role as molecular recognition probes which could bind to the target Hg2+ specifically. The extent of Hg2+-triggered self-assembly of QDs depended on the concentration of Hg2+, which resulted in an exciton energy transfer effect between QDs, giving an obvious fluorescence signal decrease and red-shift of the fluorescent peak. Based on this principle, we could detect the Hg2+ in two different signal modes. The limit of detection (LOD) was 3.33 nM. The proposed sensing method exhibited its application in detecting Hg2+ in real water samples with satisfactory performance. The results indicated that this proposed sensor will be of great potential in biological and analytical fields. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sensitive and efficient detection of protein markers, such as transcription factors (TFs), is an important issue in postgenomic era. In this paper, we report a DNA nanodevice, allosteric DNA-silver nanocluster switches (AgSwitches), for TFs detection. The mechanism of this nanodevice is based on the binding-induced allostery whereby the binding between AgSwitches and TFs alters the conformation of AgSwitches. This alteration brings DNA-silver nanocluster (DNA-AgNCs) and guanine-rich enhancer sequences (GRS) into close proximity, generating fluorescent enhancement for quantifications. Our results revealed that the sequence design of AgSwitches can be rationally optimized according to stimulated free energy, and we demonstrated that this method can not only be used for detecting TFs in nuclear extracts of cells, but also be developed as a tool for screening inhibitors of TFs. Overall, this work expanded the category allosteric DNA nanodevices by first introducing DNA-AgNCs into this area, and the obtained method was efficient for TFs-related investigations.

AB A simple and sensitive inner filter effect and charge transfer dual response ratiometric fluorescent probe (D-RFP) for sensing glucose was developed based on etching of silver nanoprisms (Ag NPRs). The D-RFP was proposed by hybridizing red emitting CdTe QDs and blue emitting CDs into core-shell structured silica nanoparticles. In this design, when mixed Ag NPRs with the D-RFP, QDs which embedded in silica nanoparticles can be quenched by Ag NPRs via inner filter effect. Ag NPRs can be effectively etched to silver ions by H2O2 which can bind with CDs and quench CDs by charge transfer. The etching of Ag NPRs leaded to the recovering the fluorescence of QDs and quenching the fluorescence of CDs. Under optimal condition, D-RFP can be exploited for H2O2 detection with detection limit of 0.28 mu M and glucose sensing with detection limit of 0.64 mu M. The developed approach was applied to monitor glucose levels in human serum samples with satisfactory results. Moreover, this method provided a new idea for designing D-RFP and can be extended to other detection systems based on silver nanoparticles (including Ag NPs, Ag NPRs, or Au@Ag nanorods) etching process.

AB Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) have shown to be the biologically active constituents responsible for the therapeutic action of panax notoginseng. PNS could help to restrain the oxidative stress, however, whether biomechanical properties of the single cell involve in the protective effect exerted by PNS against oxidative stress injury remains unclear. In this work, we investigated the protective mechanism of PNS against oxidative stress based on the PeakForce Tapping technology firstly, focusing on the biomechanical properties of single human umbilical vascular endothelium cell (HUVEC). PNS display distinct inhibition on the reduction of the young's modulus of cells caused by oxidative stress damage. Combining with immunofluorescence assay, it indicates that improving the stability of cytoskeleton is a significant way for PNS to play a protective role in HUVEC cells during oxidative damage. This work provides a new idea for exploring the functional mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine at the single cell level, and reveals great potential of the atomic force microscope in studying the drug mechanism.

AB BODIPY-based probes have excellent fluorescence properties. However, small Stokes shifts approximately 5-15 nm greatly affect their detection sensitivity. In this study, we compared the Stokes shifts of reported BODIPY-based probes with various of substituents, and found that the phenyl groups on the specific position of BODIPY core could expand the Stokes shift of BODIPY-based probes, and methoxy groups on these phenyl substituents could enhance such effects. Then, by quantum chemical calculations, we found that the number of methoxy groups might also have obvious effect on the Stokes shift of BODIPY. Taking nitric oxide (NO) as analyte, 4,4-difluoro-8-(3,4-diaminophenyl)-3,5-bis(2,4dimethoxyphenyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indancene (DMOPB) with diaminophenyl substituents has been designed and synthesized. Compared with monomethoxy-phenyl substituted BODIPY-based probes (MOPBs) in our previous work, Stokes shift of DMOPB was expanded by 10 nm when using dimethoxyphenyl instead of monomethoxyphenyl, which is basically consistent with the quantum chemistry calculation of 11 nm. DMOPB can react with NO in only 2 min to form the triazole DMOPB-T with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.32. An excellent linear relationship was observed in the range of NO concentration from 0.5 mu M to 4 mu M and the detection limit was 1 nM. The experimental results indicate that DMOPB with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, low toxicity and dark background can be a great candidate for imaging NO in cells and tissues. Considering the lack of practical way to increase Stokes shift of small-molecule fluorescent probes based on specific fluorophore, the proposed strategy has great potential for the designing of probes with large Stokes shift.

AB A porous layer open-tubular capillary column with immobilized pH gradient (PLOT-IPG) was prepared in two steps. First, a partially filled porous layer open tubular capillary column containing active epoxy groups was synthesized by in situ polymerization of acrylamide, glycidyl methacrylate, and N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide. Then, an aqueous solution of commercial carrier ampholytes (CAs, Pharmalyte) was focused in the prepared polymer column. With the column immobilized by Pharmalyte 4.5-6.0 (narrow pH range) or Pharmalyte 3.0-10.0 (wide pH range), proteins with known pIs were separated and a good linear correlation between pI values and migration times was obtained. Meanwhile, resolution was improved compared to the traditional gradient with a wide pH range. A mixture of low molecular weight amino acids was separated with the narrow pH range PLOT-IPG column; from the obtained results, the resolution of our new column was calculated to be at most 0.09 pH unit. In addition, human serum proteins were analyzed with the newly developed wide and narrow pH range PLOT-IPG columns; its sensitivity and resolution in the narrow pH range one were better than capillary electrophoresis.

AB A novel screening method for the simultaneous detection of elaidic and vaccenic trans fatty acid isomers by CZE-UV was proposed and applied to brazilian spreadable cheese analysis. Optimized background electrolyte was composed by 10 mmol L-1 heptakis (2, 3, 6-tri-o-methyl)-beta cyclodextrin, 24 mmol L-1 sodium tetraborate buffer solution, 45% methanol and 15% acetonitrile. Sample preparation comprised only a saponification reaction and dilution of sample solution before analysis. The method proved to be simple, environmental friendly and sensitive (LOD calculated for elaidic and vaccenic acid were 0.0163 mmol L-1 and 0.0169 mmol L-1, respectively) and may be used to detect adulteration in dairy products, where the addition of hydrogenated vegetable fat to food is prohibited.

AB An on-line liquid chromatography-comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (LC-GC x GC) separation process, combined with a dual detection system, namely triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (used as a single quadrupole - QMS) and flame ionization detection (FID), was developed for the analysis of cosmetic lip care products. The LC step was carried out by using a fused-core silica column, with this enabling the separation of mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH), as well as polyolefin oligomeric saturated hydrocarbons (POSH), from the mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbon (MOAH) families. Each chemical class was then subjected to GC x GC-QMS/FID analysis, using a medium polarity-low polarity column combination. Notwithstanding the utility of the flame ionization detector for quantification purposes, it is obviously also desirable to obtain information on the type of hydrocarbons present (of mineral or synthetic origin), in order to identify a potential contamination source. Following method optimization, various analytical figures of merit (method linearity, intra-and inter-day repeatability, limits of detection and quantification, and injector discrimination) were measured. Specifically, for MOSH and MOAH, linearities were evaluated in the 32.5-2080 and 50-500 mg L-1 range, respectively; furthermore, intra- and inter-day repeatability values were 6.2 and 8.3%, respectively, while limits of detection and quantification were 3.5 and 11.8 mg L-1, respectively.
   The proposed method, enables for the first time (to the best of the authors' knowledge), the detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons, in a single run and in a fully-automated manner. Quantities of MOSH thorn POSH in the cosmetic products ranged from 8.7 to 44.4% (CV values were in the 1.5-5.4% range) while MOAH contamination was found in four samples, ranging from 386 to 5869 mg kg(-1) (CV values were in the 0.5-4.5% range).

AB Recent works of designing excellent adsorbents emphasized on the specific surface areas and porosities of the materials. This study presents the influence of morphological modulation on extraction efficiencies of materials for the first time. Sea urchin-like nanoporous carbon (NPC), derived from metal organic framework (MOF), was synthesized and fabricated as solid phase microextraction (SPME) device. The morphological modulated structure of the NPC, with enhanced effective adsorption sites produced by the pointed and sharp edges, could improve the extraction efficiencies of the NPC. Comparing with the unmodulated one, NPC with morphological modulation possessed higher extraction efficiencies (2 flod) as well as accelerated sampling rates (5 flod) on benzene series compounds (BTEX), improving the sensitivity of the sampling method (limits of detection ranged from 0.08 ng L-1 to 0.36 ng L-1). Moreover, it was also the first time that the moisture sensitive MOF-derived NPC was exploited as the SPME adsorbent. In general, this study was expected to be an important advance in broadening the approaches on designing a superior SPME adsorbents not only emphasizing on the specific surface area as well as porosity but also the morphology.

AB In this work, carbon quantum dots (CQD) encapsulated in super small platinum nanocrystals core-shell architecture/nitrogen doped graphene hybrid nanocomposite (CQD@PDA@PtNCs-NGR) was design synthesized. Without using any capping reagent, stabilizer and surfactant, very small CQD was served as template and anchoring point for the synthesis of Pt NCs with a super small size (2.25 nm) and a uniform distribution. Meanwhile, dopamine (DA) was used as bridging agent, positioning agent and weak reducing agent to make Pt2+ grow on the CQD. Combine the high dispersed Pt NCs with high specific surface area and high conductivity of NGR, the CQD@PDA@PtNCs-NGR shows excellent electrocatalytic performance towards the biosensing of DNA damage biomarker-8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG). A very low detection limit of 0.45 nM and 0.85 nM (S/N = 3), a wide linear range of 0.013 mu M -109.78 mu M and a high sensitivity of 7.912 mA mu M-1 cm(-2) and 4.190 mA mu M-1 cm(-2) were obtained. The fabricated CQD@PDA@PtNCs-NGR realized the detection of 8-OH-dG in human urine practical sample. Furthermore, CQD@ PDA@ PtNCs-NGR was applied for the determination of 8-OH-dG generated from damaged DNA and damaged guanine (G), respectively. This work effectively combines the electrochemical signal of 8-OH-dG with DNA damage, confirms the mechanism of DNA damage, which might pave a new way to establish the associations between degree of DNA damage and 8-OH-dG.

AB Herein, a novel magnetic biocomposite (Fe3O4@Au-S1/S2) was applied to analyze thrombin. The Fe3O4@Au-S1/S2 consisted of Fe3O4@Au nanoparticles (Fe3O4@Au NPs) as carriers for magnetic separation and magnetic field-induced self-assembly, thiolated complementary strand (S1) anchored based on Au-S bond and thrombin binding aptamer (S2) as a recognition element. As a redox indicator, methylene blue (MB) can be adsorbed to DNA anchored on the surface of Fe3O4@Au NPs by electro-static interaction. In the absence of thrombin, MB were adsorbed on double-stranded DNA (S1/S2) which anchored on Fe3O4@Au NPs and a high electrochemical signal of MB was recorded by Differential pulse voltammetry. Conversely, the complementary strand (S1) exposed after thrombin competitively bonded with aptamer. The introduction of Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme (S3) split S1 at specific rA site, resulting in the significantly decreased adsorption capacity of MB. Thus, the thrombin detection could be recorded by monitoring the electrochemical signal reduction of MB through incubation of thrombin with S3. This method exhibited a high sensitivity toward thrombin with a broad linear range from 5 pmol L-1 to 5 nmol L-1 and a limit of detection of 1.8 pmol L-1. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The as-prepared Pd/POMs/NHCSs tri-component nanohybrids provide enhanced electro-catalytic activities for oxidation of acetaminophen (AP) with the catalytic rate constant (kcat) of 2.34 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) and diffusion coefficient (D) of 6.18 x 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1), because of the synergetic effects of Pd NPs and NHCSs. We assessed the use of Pd/POMs/NHCSs as an effective sensing template for electrochemical detection of AP, which showed high analytical performance, such as a linear range of 0.02 mu M-0.63 mu M with a sensitivity of 508.46 mu AmM-1; a linear range of 0.63 mu M to 0.083 mM with a sensitivity of 154.27 mu AmM-1, and a low limit of detection of 3 nM. This strategy provides a new direction opportunity to promote the electrochemical performance of AP. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the low-cost carbon nanorods assembled hierarchical meso-macroporous carbons networks aerogels (CNs-HMCNAs) was environment-friendly synthesized from a cheap and abundant biomass of apples (Malus pumila Mill) for the first time. The biomass of apples derived CNs-HMCNAs exhibited the unique hierarchical meso-macroporous structure with large specific surface area and high density of edge defective sites. At the CNs-HMCNAs modified GCE (CNs-HMCNAs/GCE), the electron transfer between the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and the ascorbic acid (AA) (or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)) was effectively enhanced, and thus induced a low overvoltage for AA electrooxidation (or H2O2 electroreduction). As an electrochemical AA (or H2O2) sensor, the CNs-HMCNAs/GCE exhibited wider linear range, lower detection limit, higher sensitivity and stability than GCE and the carbon nanotubes modified GCE (CNTs/GCE). In particular, the CNs-HMCNAs/GCE showed great potential feasibility in the practical determination of AA (in AA injection, Vitamin C tablet and kiwi juice) or H2O2 (in human urine, milk and beer).

AB Herein, a novel electrochemical biosensor for sensitive analysis of prostate specific antigen (PSA) is demonstrated. A specific peptide is employed on the gold electrode as a molecular recognition element for target induced cleavage. In the absence of PSA, graphene oxide (GO) is directly immobilized on the peptide modified electrode, which triggers the aggregation of silver ions and subsequent reduction reaction to form silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Well defined sharp silver stripping peak can thus be achieved, which stands for a highly characteristic solid-state Ag/AgCl reaction. However, in the presence of PSA, the peptide is specifically recognized and cleaved. The resulted product on the electrode surface cannot aid the immobilization of GO and subsequent formation of AgNPs. Therefore, electrochemical response is decreased remarkably, which can be used to indicate the concentration of PSA. This work demonstrates that the combination of the transduction of peptide cleavage event with GO/AgNPs nanocomposites is a promising attempt for PSA analysis with high sensitivity and selectivity.

AB A new generation of silver-based polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) sorbent coatings has been developed and applied in solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The new materials are based on ionic liquid monomers formed by cations containing the silver(I) ion coordinated with two 1-vinylimidazole ligands. Up to seven different silver-based PIL sorbent coatings were developed by polymerizing the silver-IL monomer in the presence of either silver bis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl] imide, and/or a dicationic ionic liquid crosslinker. The obtained sorbent coatings were found to possess adequate thermal stability despite the presence of the silver(I) ions. Thermal desorption of the analytes at 175 degrees C was effectively used without any significant decrease in extraction efficiency. The developed sorbent coatings were used in two different applications: the determination of alkenes/alkynes via headspace SPME and the determination of unsaturated fatty acids using direct-immersion SPME. In the former approach, the silver-based PILs were particularly selective for the determination of unsaturated compounds with terminal double bonds such as 1,5-hexadiene, 2-methyl-1,5-hexadiene, and 1,8-nonadiene. A study of the extraction mechanism of the analytes to the sorbent coating revealed a competitive partitioning of the analytes. In the second approach, the most selective silver-based PILs were applied for the determination of oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid. After proper optimization of the method, the coatings were found to be more or as sensitive as the commercial polydimethylsiloxane fiber. Limits of detection between 2.6 and 8.2 mu g L-1 in ultrapure water and from 12 to 14 mu g L-1 in tap water were obtained for the best silver-based PIL, with relative standard deviations lower than 13% in all cases at a spiked level of 160 mu g L-1. Finally, the fiber was effectively applied for the analysis of rinse water from a dairy farm, with adequate detection of the analytes at concentrations between 52 and 179 mu g L-1.

AB Antibiotics are a group of antibacterial drugs used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial diseases in humans, veterinary animals, and farmed fish. Inappropriate and excessive use of antibiotic therapy leads to antibiotic fragment in the water bodies thus affect the aquatic organisms. In this study, an amino group modified high surface area metal-organic framework (MOF) MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 was used to prepare solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber to detect four different classes (total 6 ABs) of antibiotics for the first time from living tilapia fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) by coupling SPME with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The extraction efficiencies of the custom-made fiber were superior as compared with the commercial C18, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), PDMS/divinylbenzene (DVB) and polyacrylate fibers. The custom-made fiber also exhibited excellent reproducibility with the low intra-fiber relative standard deviations (RSDs 1.5%-8.3%) and inter-fiber RSDs (7.3%-14.5%), which made it ideal for in vivo extraction in fish muscle. The as-prepared MIL-101( Cr)-NH2 fiber was then used to determine antibiotics in the dorsal-epaxial muscle of living fish. Comparing to the traditional solid-liquid extraction (SLE) method, the SPME method showed reduced invasiveness and higher sensitivity than the SLE method. In general, this study explored a convenient, cost-effective and highly sensitive SPME method based on amino modified MOF for in vivo antibiotic detection in fish muscle. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present study, we developed a novel method to simultaneously detect eight classes of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and Dechlorane Plus (DP), in sediment and fish tissue samples. The samples were extracted by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) system, and the extracts were purified and fractionated into fraction1 and fraction2 with multi-layer silica gel column, followed by further fractionation using a basic alumina column (fraction1) and a Florisil column (fraction2), respectively. Finally, fractions were analyzed with different chromatographic columns and different detectors according to the properties of a chemical compound. The limit of detection for eight classes of POPs ranged from 1 to 30 pg/gdw in fish tissue samples, and from 1 to 33 pg/gdw in sediment samples, except for SCCPs (from 5.6 to 7.6 ng/g in fish tissue samples, and from 1.2 to 8.3 ng/gdw in sediment samples). The recoveries of eight classes of POPs spiked in fish tissue and sediment samples ranged from 43% to 120%, and from 45% to 115%, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 25%. The accuracy of method was satisfactorily demonstrated by analysis of standard reference materials NIST SRM 1649b and WMF-01. In addition, the newly developed method was successfully applied for analysis of sediment and fish samples collected from the Baiyangdian Lake. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be challenging due to the overlap in their clinical presentations in some patients. There is a need for a more objective clinical test that can be routinely used in primary care settings. Through an untargeted H-1 NMR urine metabolomic approach, we identified a set of endogenous metabolites as potential biomarkers for the differentiation of asthma and COPD. A subset of these potential biomarkers contains 7 highly polar metabolites of diverse physicochemical properties. To the best of our knowledge, there is no liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method that evaluated more than two of the target metabolites in a single analytical run. The target metabolites belong to the families of monosaccharides, organic acids, amino acids, quaternary ammonium compounds and nucleic acids, rendering hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) an ideal technology for their quantification. Since a clinical decision is to be made from patients data, a fully validated analytical method is required for biomarker validation. Method validation for endogenous metabolites is a daunting task since current guidelines were designed for exogenous compounds. As such, innovative approaches were adopted to meet the validation requirements. Herein, we describe a sensitive HILIC-MS/MS method for the quantification of the 7 endogenous urinary metabolites. Detection was achieved in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with polarity switching, using quadrupole-linear ion trap instrument (QTRAP 6500) as well as single ion monitoring in the negative-ion mode. The method was fully validated according to the regulatory guidelines. Linearity was established between 6 and 21000 ng/mL and quality control samples demonstrated acceptable intra-and inter-day accuracy (85.7%-112%), intra-and inter-day precision (CV% <11.5%) as well as stability under various storage and sample processing conditions. To illustrate the method's applicability, the validated method was applied to the analysis of a small set of urine samples collected from asthma and COPD patients. Preliminary modelling of separation was generated using partial least square discriminant analysis (R-2 0.752 and Q(2) 0.57). The adequate separation between patient samples confirms the diagnostic potential of these target metabolites as a proof-of-concept for the differentiation between asthma and COPD. However, more patient urine samples are needed in order to increase the statistical power of the analytical model. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Isotope-tracing facilitates the understanding of metabolic regulation in biological systems. Depending on the selection of tracers, some essential metabolites cannot be traced. A comprehensive understanding of the regulated pathways can only be achieved with focus beyond labeled metabolites. The isotope tracing assisted metabolic profiling described here is a platform for high throughput mapping of isotope labeled metabolites with simultaneous metabolomics profiling. This approach incorporates an in-house MS/MS library for metabolite identification and ID-based quantitation. An "Isotopic" software was developed to generate potential labeled isotopomers. Using this platform, a total of 394 metabolites were reliably identified based on MS/MS confirmation in 3 million 293 T cells, among which 54 and 43 metabolites were discovered to carry extensive labels (>2%) from C-13(6)-glucose and C-13(5)-glutamine respectively. Citrate flowing into malate shuttle was also observed. More interestingly, the rate-limiting step in NAD and UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis was clearly observed according to time course labeling. In HSP60 knockdown cell lines, enhanced purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis were confirmed by the abundance and labeling percentages of intermediate metabolites. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The prospect of developing new bio-based products from lignin partially depends on the development of effective analytical techniques to characterize the end products from lignin degradation experiments. To date, the most utilized mass spectrometric technique for characterizing lignin oligomers has been negative ion mass spectrometry. Positive ion mass spectrometry remains a relatively unexplored approach for lignin sequencing. Here we report on the sequencing of lignin oligomers using lithium cationization positive ion electrospray followed by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) tandem mass spectrometry on a high-resolution accurate-mass Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Thirteen synthetic lignin model oligomers containing beta-O-4 and 4-O-alpha linkages were analyzed and sequenced based on their HCD tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns. Proposed sequence-specific fragmentation pathways are provided. The method presented in this study provides a potential application of lithium cationization tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of lignin degradation products. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The deposition of chemical reagent inks on paper is a crucial step in the development and fabrication of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs). A pen-plotting approach, delivering chemical ink deposition using technical pens filled with reagents and inserted into a desktop electronic plotter, is shown herein to be a versatile, low-cost, simple, rapid, reproducible, and high-throughput solution. The volume of the deposited ink was quantified gravimetrically, confirming that nanoliter volumes of reagents can be deposited reproducibly (e.g. 7.55 +/- 0.37 nL/mm for a plotting speed of 10 cm/s) in detection zones of mu PADs, typically spatially defined using wax printing. This approach was further investigated with regard to deposition of reagents in different geometrical forms (circular and linear), so demonstrating its applicability for preparation of mu PADs with flexible design and application. By adjusting the plotting speed for linear deposition, lines with a relatively large range of widths (approximate to 628-1192 mm) were created. Circular deposition was also demonstrated via delivery of reagents within wax printed circular fluidic barriers of a range of diameters (inner diameter = 1.5-7 mm). These capabilities were practically demonstrated via the fabrication of mu PADs, based upon differing detection principles for determination of aluminum in natural waters using Morin as the fluorescent reagent. Traditional mu PADs based on digital image colorimetry (DIC) were produced using circular deposition, whilst distance-based mu PADs exploited linear deposition. Both types of mu PADs developed using this method showed excellent precision for determination of trace concentrations of aluminium (average RSDs = 3.38% and 6.45%, and LODs = 0.5 ng (0.25 ppm) and 2 ng (0.5 ppm), for traditional and distance-based detection, respectively).

AB Quantum dots (QDs), drawing large attention during the past three decades, have been extensively applied in lighting, display, and biodetection. However, the mechanism for their ability in biodetection, especially in recognizing toxic metal ions, has scarcely been explored. In this work, three sets of CuInS2@ZnS QDs systems with inert shell thickness varying from 1.1 to 4.1 nm have been performed. As the shrinkage of inert shell, QDs not only show red-shift emission but also demonstrate more sensitive and higher response to the added Cd2+. The thin-shell CuInS2@ZnS QDs could detect 0.91 nM Cd2+, and could further detect 4.36 nM Cd2+ when integrated with paper-based platform. Importantly, thin-shell CuInS2@ZnS QDs combined with paper-based platform can detect 105.86 nM Cd2+ even just applying mobile phone as detector and hand-held UV lamp as excitation resource. The mechanism is further proposed based on the energy transfer routes. The thin inert shell can not completely protect the emissive core away from the surface defects, but it can neither exclude the energy transfer from the surface to the emissive core. The added Cd2+ would facilitate the formation of CdS on the surface of QDs, which not only can alleviate the surface defects but also can transfer energy to emissive CuInS2, thus thinning the thickness of inert shell greatly boost the detection sensitivity.

AB In terms of hybridization assays surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) offers high throughput, label-free and real-time monitoring of the binding kinetics. This requires DNA microarrays on bare or modified gold SPRi chips, which are generally premade by an off-line microspotting procedure. Therefore, the surface density of the immobilized probes is not known although it is an essential quality control parameter, especially, when it can vary in a broad range as in case of self-assembled thiol-labeled DNAs on gold surface. Here we show that the small molecular weight ruthenium(III) hexamine complex (RuHex) introduced earlier for electrochemical quantitation of DNA coverage on gold electrodes can be used also in SPRi to assess the surface density of DNA probes in DNA microarrays. A single injection of RuHex solution allows the simultaneous visualization and quantification of the surface density of DNA probes (ranging in this study from 4 x 10(11) to 1.7 x 10(13) molecules cm(-2)) on all spots of a microarray made by microspotting thiol labeled short DNA probes both in prehybridized and single-stranded form on a gold SPRi chip. The methodology was applied to determine the effect of the surface density of DNA probes on the hybridization efficiency and kinetics of complementary microRNAs, using hsa-miR-208a3p as model. Single mismatch duplexes were found to be more effectively destabilized than fully complementary duplexes by steric hindrance at large surface densities of the DNA probes, which offers an effective mean to increase single mismatch selectivity.

AB In order to develop a sensitive immunoassay for Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) monitoring, a hybridoma secreting anti-AFB1 monoclonal antibody with high binding affinity was screened. A new type of CdTe/CdS/ZnS quantum dot was synthesized and conjugated with an artificial antigen for use as a fluorescent probe in a simple one-step fluorescence immunoassay (FLISA). The developed FLISA allowed a sensitive determination of AFB1 in cereal samples in a wide linear range, from 0.08 to 1.97 ng mL(-1), with a detection limit of 0.01 ng mL(-1) in cereal samples. The corresponding immunoglobulin genes of the Fab fragment were cloned and sequenced, and expression of Fab was successfully verified in HEK293 cells, with a K-D value of 1.09 x 10(-7) mol L-1 for AFB1. To investigate the interactions between the antibody and AFB1, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, and quantum-chemical computation were performed on AFB1 and a homology model of the Fab fragment. Our results showed that residues Ser32, Trp93, and Trp98 played the most important roles in the binding through hydrogen bonds formation, Pi-Pi stacked/Pi-alkyl interactions, and van der Waals interactions. In addition, the electrostatic potential study of AFB1 demonstrated that electrostatic interactions also played an important role in the recognition process. Results from theoretical studies provide guidance for hapten design and antibody improvement through genetic engineering. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We reported a novel bimetallic cerium/copper-based metal organic framework (Ce/Cu-MOF) and its derivatives pyrolyzed at different temperatures, followed by exploiting them as the scaffold of electrochemical aptamer sensors for extremely sensitive detection of trace tobramycin (TOB) in human serum and milk. After the calcination at high temperature, the meal coordination centers (Ce and Cu) were transferred to metal oxides containing various chemical valences, such as Ce(III), Ce(IV), Cu(II) and Cu(0), which were embedded within the mesoporous carbon network originated from the organic ligands (represented by CeO2/CuOx@mC). Owning to the strong synergistic effect among the metal oxides, mesoporous carbon, and small cavities and open channels of MOF, the as-prepared CeO2/CuOx@mC nanocomposites not only possess good electrochemical activity but also exhibit strong bioaffinity toward the aptamer strands. By comparing the electrochemical biosensing peroformances using on the Ce/CuMOF- and the series of CeO2/CuOx@mC-based aptasensors, the constructed CeO2/CuOx@mC900-based (calcinated at 900 degrees C) aptasensor exhibits an extremely low detection limit of 2.0 fg mL(-1) within a broad linear TOB concentration range from 0.01 pgmL(-1) to 10 ng mg L-1. It demonstrates that the proposed aptasensor is substantially superior to those previously reported in the literature, along with high selectivity, good stability and reproducibility, and acceptable applicability in human serum and milk.
   Thereby, the newly fabricated aptasensing approach based on bimetallic CeO2/CuOx@mC has a considerable potential for the quantitative detection of antibiotics in the food safety and biomedical field. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Development of sensitive methods for trace aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) determination is of great significance due to its high toxicity and carcinogenicity. Herein, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-capped ternary CdZnTe quantum dots (QDs) have been prepared via a simple hydrothermal route. We found that they exhibited enhanced intensity when benchmarked against their binary counterpart CdTe QDs. On this basis, a target-driven switch-on fluorescence aptasensor for trace AFB1 determination has been developed by employing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the CdZnTe QDs and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) pair. In the detection diagram, amino group-functionalized aptamers against AFB1 were firstly labelled with the CdZnTe QDs donors coated on silica nanospheres while the AuNPs acceptors were bioconjugated with the thiol group-modified complementary DNA (cDNA) of aptamer. By taking advantage of the DNA hybridization of aptamer and cDNA, the CdZnTe QDs (energy donor) and AuNPs (energy acceptor) were brought into close proximity, thereby leading to the occurrence of FRET during the aptasensor fabrication. When the aptasensor was incubated with AFB1, the specific binding between aptamer and target resulted in the detachment of AuNPs acceptors. This behavior would disturb the FRET process and led to the subsequent fluorescence recovery of CdZnTe QDs. Such designed aptasensor showed an increased fluorescence recovery upon the increasing concentration of AFB1 over a broad range of 50 pg mL(-1) - 100 ng mL(-1) and succeeded in spiked peanut samples. The proposed aptasensor is separation-free and easy-to-use, which might open up new possibilities in aptasensor fabrication by employing the novel CdZnTe QDs-AuNPs pair. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of various biological processes and have been used as potential biomarkers for biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. Here, nicking-mediated rolling circle amplification (N-RCA)/symmetric isothermal circular strand-displacement amplification (S-SDA)-integrated combined cascade amplification (rs-CCA) was proposed for let-7a miRNA detection. Via introducing a palindromic fragment-integrated recognition sites for nicking endonuclease Nt.AlWI into the padlock probe, the hybridization of target miRNA can induce N-RCA and continuously generate the nicked fragments (NFs). Because the released NFs each have a palindromic sequence and daughter nicking site at the 3' end, they hybridize with each other, followed by alternately extension by polymerase and nicking by endonuclease. This leads to S-SDA effect, and the released single-stranded products in turn hybridize with NFs, accomplishing the rs-CCA process. When the Sybr Green I dyes intercalate into double-stranded DNA products, the amplified fluorescence signal is achieved. Thus, the target miRNA can be detected down to 5 pM. Importantly, the rs-CCA system is capable of distinguishing the single base difference between target miRNAs, indicating the high sequence specificity. Moreover, its cpotential application in disease diagnosis was demonstrated via detecting target miRNA in complex biological matrix and analyzing the total RNAs extracted from HeLa cells. As a proof-of-concept building, the impressive rs-CCA scheme is expected to provide a valuable insight into constructing powerful signal amplification strategies via sophisticated combination of biotechnologies available for nucleic acid manipulation and significantly benefit biomedical research and disease diagnostics.

AB Reliable and simple detection methods for chemotherapeutic agent contaminants, such as methotrexate, are required to minimize their possible toxic threat. However, detecting them remains a challenging in environmental and biological analysis. Here, we developed a fluorescent N, S co-doped carbon quantum dots (N, S co-doped CQDs) probe to detect methotrexate on the basis of the inner filter effect of fluorescence. Under optimized conditions, the fluorescent probe exhibits high sensitivity and specific selectivity with a linear detection range from 0.4 mu g/mL to 41.3 mu g/mL and a low detection limit of 12 ng/mL (S/N = 3). Further, this N, S co-doped CQDs fluorescent probe can be used to analyze extracellular fluids and wastewater samples satisfactorily, thereby showing a remarkable potential for broad applications in biological molecule determination and environmental analysis.

AB The performance of microarray assays results from the optimization of several parameters: in particular, the physical-chemical properties of the surface play a pivotal role in determining the robustness of the technology. Usually, microarray substrates are entirely modified with coatings able to bind, covalently or not, bioprobes. Here we present a new, fully automated approach for the immobilization of biomolecules, based on the deposition of pL amounts of water solutions of DMA based copolymers on an uncoated surface, followed by the deposition, on the same spot, of the probe. Starting from a common precursor, polymers with different characteristics and functionalities are obtained by post-polymerization modification and by combining different monomers during the synthesis. This strategy, allows to functionalize and tailor the surface properties of discrete areas of the same array with different chemistries, that coexist on a single substrate. As a consequence, probes with different functionalities are bound simultaneously to neutral, positively, negatively charged, hydrophobic, hydrophilic polymers, in micrometersized spots. The proposed polymer array, applicable to both DNA or protein, offers advantages in terms of time and costs reduction, since pretreatment and coating steps are totally avoided, and the requested polymer amount is extremely low. Moreover, it provides a strategy perfectly suitable for miniaturization applicable to integrated biosensors or Lab-on-a-chip devices. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study introduces a new strategy for periodic stacking of positively charged NiAl layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets with negatively charged monolayers of graphene (G) by systematically optimizing several parameters in a controlled co-feeding fashion and resultant heterostacked NiAl LDH/G LBL nanocomposites have been practically applied in sensitive detection of dopamine released from live cells as early Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnostic tool. PD is the second most chronic neurodegenerative disorder with gradual progressive loss of movement and muscle control causing substantial disability and threatening the life seriously. Unfortunately majority of dopaminergic neurons present in substantia nigra of PD patients are destroyed before it is being clinically diagnosed, so early stages PD diagnosis is essential. Because of direct neighboring of extremely conductive graphene to semiconductive LDHs layers, enhanced intercalation capability of LDHs, and huge surface area with numerous active sites, good synergy effect is harvested in heteroassembled NiAl LDH/G LBL material, which in turn shows admirable electrocatalytic ability in DA detection. The interference induced by UA and AA is effectively eliminated especially after the modifying the electrode with Nafion. The outstanding electrochemical sensing performance of NiAl LDH/G LBL modified electrode has been achieved in terms of broad linear range and lowest real detection limit of 2 nM (S/N = 3) towards DA oxidation. Benefitting from superior efficiency, biosensor has been successfully used for real-time in-vitro tracking of DA efflux from live human nerve cell after being stimulated. We believe that our biosensing platform of structurally integrated well-ordered LBL heteroassembly by inserting graphene directly to the interlayer galleries of LDHs material will open up new avenue in diseases determination window.

AB Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a universal and important hydrolase that has been proved to be associated with several diseases. Herein, a simple and effective method was proposed for ALP detection based on the inner filter effect of p-nitrophenol (pNP) on the fluorescence of CdTe/CdS quantum dots (QDs). For the preparation of CdTe/CdS QDs, Na2TeO3 was used as the Te source, and dithiol as the S source and surface ligand. The as-prepared CdTe/CdS QDs show good fluorescence properties, such as high quantum yield (similar to 80%), and good chemical/photo-stability. pNP is a hydrolysate of p-nitrophenol phosphate disodium salt under the catalysis of ALP, which could effectively quench the fluorescence of QDs due to the absorption spectra of pNP overlaps well with the excitation spectra of the CdTe/CdS QDs. Therefore, the prepared CdTe/CdS QDs could be applied for ALP detection. A good linear relationship ranging from 2.2 to 220 U/L was obtained with the limit of detection as low as 0.34 U/L. In addition, this method was successfully applied for the assay of ALP in human serum with the satisfactory results. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB When fluorophores attach to nanostructured films of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs), a quenching of their fluorescence may occur. We have exploited these characteristics for the development of polymeric films that can be used in a simple and efficient molecular diagnosis protocol based on the selective detection of nucleic acids. Our procedure rests on the fact that the fluorescence of 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled single-stranded DNA (FAM-ssDNA) probes is quenched upon their immobilization on nanostructured ICP - polypyrrole (PPY) and polyaniline (PANI) - films deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. Hybridization occurs whenever a sample with the complementary sequence is brought in contact with the immobilized probe, with the newly formed dsDNA chains detaching from the flexible polymeric film and causing the restoration of the fluorescence. This sensing system exhibits a low background signal that depends on both the thickness and hydrophobicity of the films. As a model system, we used a FAM-ssDNA probe specific for the Leishmania infantum parasite. The results confirm this procedure as a simple, fast and highly sensitive scheme for the recognition of the target DNA, with a detection limit of the 1.1 nM and 1.3 nM for the PPY/PET and PANI/PET films, respectively. In addition, this biosensor has excellent stability and exhibits a good and reproducible performance even when used for the direct detection of ssDNA in relatively complex biological samples.

AB Although various methods have been developed to suffice the oligonucleotide demand of molecular biology laboratories, in vitro production of high-purity ssDNAs remains to be a challenging task. We hypothesized that complementing the asymmetric PCR with 3' phosphate blocked limiting primer decreases the mispriming thus reduces polymerisation of DNA by-products. The presented results attest our assumption that the primer blocked asymmetric PCR (PBA-PCR) selectively produces ssDNA of interest and is even suitable for effective amplification of DNA libraries of large sequence space. The high-throughput sequence analysis demonstrated that PBA-PCR also alleviates the PCR bias obstacle since it does not distort the sequence space. The practicability of the novel method was verified by monitoring the process of SELEX and screening of aptamer candidates using PBA-PCR produced ssDNAs in Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay. In summary, we have developed a generally applicable method for straightforward, cost-effective production of ssDNA with on demand labelling. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of organic solvent from sample extracts is required before analysis by reversed phase HPLC to preserve chromatographic performance and allow for bigger injection volumes, boosting sensitivity. Herein, an automated on-line extraction evaporation procedure is integrated with HPLC analysis. The evaporation occurs inside a 200 mm microfluidic channel confined by a vapor permeable membrane. A feedback control algorithm regulates evaporation rate keeping the output flow rate constant. The evaporation process across this membrane was firstly characterized with water/solvent mixtures showing organic solvent removal capabilities. This system allowed continuous methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile removal from samples containing up to 80% organic solvent. An evaporative injection procedure was developed demonstrating the use of the device for fully integrated extract reconstitution coupled to HPLC analysis, applied to analysis of the antibiotic chloramphenicol in milk samples. Sample reconstitution and collection was performed in less than 10 min and can be executed simultaneously to HPLC analysis of the previous sample in a routine workflow, thus having minimal impact on the total sample analysis time when run in a sequence.

AB An acoustic field flow fractionation (FFF) device was developed to fractionate a micro-particle mixture on the basis of the particle diameter using an acoustic force field in a carrier liquid flow. In the acoustic FFF channel used in the device, ultrasound waves generated from piezoelectric transducers driven by a sinusoidal signal of 2.02 Mhz propagated into the carrier liquid flow and built up a quarter-wavelength ultrasound standing wave field across the channel height. It was experimentally demonstrated that the acoustic field with a pressure node plane at the bottom surface of the channel reduced the thickness of the particle diffusion layer in a stagnant liquid proportional to the applied voltage driving the piezoelectric transducer. In the size-dependent particle separation, the particle mixture flowing through the acoustic FFF channel experienced an acoustic radiation force in the gravitational direction. As a result, suppressing the diffusion of small particles, particles were transported along the bottom surface of the channel with the local velocity of the carrier liquid at the particle center. The developed acoustic FFF device successfully fractionated a fluorescent micro-particle mixture (1, 3, 5, and 10 mm diameter), whereas the 3 and 5 mm particles were not fractionated in the FFF device using only the gravitational force field due to the diffusion of 3 mm particles.

AB Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) was investigated in terms of dispersion stability during the analysis process. It was shown that CZE of Au NPs can be performed under dynamic coating conditions depending on the background electrolyte (BGE) composition. The influence of both the co-ion and counter-ion in the BGE was evaluated. It was proven that the application of relatively large buffering counter-ions provides steric stability to NPs during CZE. Among the investigated co-ions, citrate and MOPS were found to be advantageous for the CZE of Au NPs. On the other hand, the presence of zwitterionic substances and multiply charged counter-ions in BGE was shown to promote the aggregation and adsorption of the NPs to the capillary wall. A correlation between the particle stability in CZE and isotachophoresis (ITP) performance was observed and discussed. A sensitivity improvement by two orders of magnitude was achieved using the developed ITP methods. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new analytical method based on capillary zone electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CZE-MS) was proposed and validated for the simultaneous determination of four stereoisomers of 3-hydroxyaspartate with two chiral centers in rat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in absence of optically pure single enantiomer standards. The derivatization reagent 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC-Cl) was found to assist chiral separation and the derivatized enantiomers of 3-hydroxyaspartate can achieve enantioseparation with a lower concentration (6 mM) of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), while underivatized 3-hydroxyaspartate cannot be separated. The enhanced interactions between derivatized analytes and beta-CD were demonstrated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR). The four stereoisomers of FMOC-3-hydroxyaspartate were identified successfully using a new method based on experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra combined with the comparison of CE peak areas. Large volume sample stacking with polarity switching (LVSS-PS) was used to increase sensitivity and the detection limit of 356 nM was achieved for L-THA, which was around 10-fold improvement compared to the normal CE-MS analysis. The composition of the background electrolyte (BGE) was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Under the optimal conditions, satisfactory results of L-THA were obtained in terms of linearity over the range of 2-80 mu M(R-2 > 0.99) and precision (RSD below 1.43% and 2.56% for migration time and peak area, respectively). The recoveries for all four stereoisomers in spiked rat CSF ranged from 91.2% to 99.5%. The method has been successfully applied to rat CSF analysis and D-erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate (D-EHA) was detected. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sr-89 and Sr-90 are both fission products of high radiotoxicity, which can be released in significant amounts in the event of a nuclear accident. Radiostrontium isotopes will follow calcium all along the food chain and, after ingestion, accumulate in the bones. Therefore, it is imperative to be able to determine Sr-89 and Sr-90 in raw milk samples in case of an accidental situation to evaluate the dose given by both radionuclides to the population. Several methods exist for conducting Sr-89 and Sr-90 determination. However, most of them use at least one chromatographic step to purify strontium. This, unfortunately, increases the analytical time before the results can be released to the authorities. In addition, they often use liquid scintillation counting to determine the Sr-89 and Sr-90 activities, a method which can handle only one sample at a time. Here we propose using synthetic tunnelmanganese oxides such as cryptomelane and todorokite and layered metal sulfides to selectively extract strontium from fresh milk and raw urine in a batch sorption method. We found that the method is very quick and yields very pure sources of (radio)-strontium, which can be counted in a proportional counter. Data (counts per minute) from the counter were fitted to a mathematical expression enabling the simultaneous determination of Sr-89 and Sr-90. Because a proportional counter often has several drawers, it is typically possible to measure up to 16 samples at a time. Since cryptomelane is a binding phase easily synthesized in a large quantity, we anticipate that this technique could be an interesting alternative to conventional solid phase extraction chromatography methods.

AB In this work, a rapid and simple method is applied using a newly synthesized nanoadsorbent for the extraction and preconcentration of the drugs Amitriptyline (AMT) and Nortriptyline (NRT), which are then determined using high performance liquid chromatography. We focus on the facile synthesis of Fe3O4@SiO2@N-3, as a new and effective adsorbent, and the effervescent salt-assisted dispersive magnetic micro solid-phase extraction method. The applied method and modification of the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 with the nitrogen-rich group lead to an increase in the interaction between the nanoadsorbent used and the analytes, and increase the extraction recovery. The accuracy of the synthesized nanoadsorbent is confirmed by the FT-IR, FE-SEM, XRD, and VSM analytical techniques. In order to obtain the best experimental conditions, optimization of the main variables involved is carried out using the central composite design method. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the limits of detection (LODs), linear dynamic ranges (LDRs), and relative standard deviations (RSDs for n = 5) for NRT and AMT were found to be as follow: LODs, 0.03 and 0.05 ng/mL; RSDs, 2.04 and 1.1 for NRT and AMT, respectively; and LDRs, 0.07-2000 ng/mL. Furthermore, the results obtained show that the nanoadsorbent can be used for five times with an extraction recovery more than 80% and 70% for AMT and NRT, respectively. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A non-targeted lipidomics workflow based on C8 core-shell particle ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) hyphenated to ESI-QTOF-MS in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode with sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) was developed and applied to differential platelet lipidomics profiling of cardiovascular disease patients (stable angina pectoris (n = 10), ST-elevated myocardial infarction (n = 13)) against healthy controls (n = 10). DIA with SWATH generates comprehensive MS and MS/MS data throughout the entire chromatograms and all study samples. Hence, chromatograms can be extracted based on precursors or fragments which provided some benefits in terms of assay specificity in some cases. SWATH acquisition offers flexible experimental design with variable Q1 isolation windows. Liquid chromatography as well as SWATH settings were optimized to cover the lipidome of human platelets. The flexibility of the SWATH experiment design was utilized to implement target SWATH windows with narrow 5 Da Q1 precursor ion selection width (multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-like SWATH windows) for the detection of low abundant oxidized phospholipids. Data processing was performed with MS-DIAL, and its feasibilities and caveats are discussed by illustrative examples. Thereby, identification of lipids is still a bottleneck in non-targeted lipidomics workflow. MS-DIAL, however, offers automatic identification via spectral matching using an in silico library. In total 1971 molecular features were detected cross the samples of which 611 were identified (total score >70%). The quality of the acquired data was validated with embedded quality control samples (n = 11). 80.3% of all features detected in the QC samples showed a coefficient of variation of below 30%. Multivariate statistics were used to visualize differences in the lipidome of distinct sample groups at a false discovery rate of 5%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inorganic nanoparticles are a fascinating class of materials which promise great potential in numerous fields, including optical (bio)sensing. Many different kinds of such nanoparticles have been widely used for fluorescent sensing and imaging due to the different merits of fluorescent nanoparticles compared to molecular fluorophores. Progress made in the rational design of nanomaterials also allowed the synthesis of hybrid phosphorescent nanoparticles, that finds growing applications in sensing due to the combination of the interesting size- and shape-dependent properties of nanomaterials with a phosphorescence-type emission.
   In this review, we intend to highlight some of progress made in this active research area and update the database of various phosphorescent nanoparticles-based sensors on the basis of different sensing targets of interest in environmental, industrial and biomedical areas.
   Following an introduction and a discussion of merits of the synergy between nanomaterials and phosphorescence detection as compared to molecular luminophores the article assesses the kinds and specific features of nanomaterials often used in phosphorescence sensing. Specific examples on the use of phosphorescence nanoparticles in chemical sensing and bioimaging are given next. A final section intends to provide an overview of the prospects of such type of nanomaterials in the design of future devices for analytical chemistry. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) is a recent microsampling technique used to obtain dried specimens of blood and other biological matrices for application to a plethora of bioanalytical purposes. As such, it can be likened to dried blood spot (DBS) technique that has been in wide use for the last 40 years. However, VAMS promises to bring some significant advantages over DBS, related to sampling volume accuracy, haematocrit (HCT) dependence, pre-treatment and automation. Although some aspects still need to be investigated in depth, VAMS is increasingly recognised as a viable alternative to DBS and other dried microsampling techniques.
   In this tutorial, different aspects of VAMS approach are described and discussed, presenting the procedures adopted and the results obtained by those authors who have developed this kind of analytical workflow in the last few years. Hopefully, this will help other scientists to find new solutions to old and recent problems related to microsampling and to produce new, sound and interesting science in this field.

AB For the first time, the dependence of a redox potential change during a reaction of peroxyl radical generation and their interaction with antioxidants was studied. A regular change of a potential is due to oxidation of an antioxidant by initiating peroxyl radicals accompanied by an electron transfer. An original direct method for determining induction periods, inhibition coefficients and an antiradical capacity using the potentiometric method is proposed. Using the proposed approach the induction periods and the inhibition coefficients of various -OH, -NH, -SH containing antioxidants were determined. The antiradical capacity of a herbal extract was studied. A high degree of correlation with a DPPH assay was obtained. RSD results obtained using the proposed approach do not exceed 7%.

AB Knowledge regarding the acid-base behaviour in non-aqueous media has remained relatively scarce in spite of its importance for many aspects of chemistry. The research presented in this work fills some of particularly important gaps in the corresponding thermodynamic data.
   We report on a detailed study of acid-base properties of dihydrogen phosphate and acetate in aprotic organic solvents (acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethylformamide). It was found that several processes, i.e. protonation, homoassociation, and dimerisation play important roles in defining the basicity of these widely important anions. In the case of dihydrogen phosphate, formation of higher homoassociates (two anions, one acid molecule and vice versa) was detected, whereas acetate formed only simple homoassociates of 1:1 stoichiometry. The dimerisation of dihydrogen phosphate and acetic acid were confirmed to be important processes as well. The thermodynamics of the above mentioned reactions was characterised in detail by means of various experimental methods: ITC, spectrophotometry, NMR-spectroscopy, and conductometry. Reliable equilibrium constants and other thermodynamic reaction functions were determined. The obtained results were discussed in terms of hydrogen bonding potential of the anions and their conjugated acids, as well as solvent properties, i.e. their ability to solvate the species involved in the studied processes.

AB In 2009, Sreekumar found that sarcosine, as an effective biomarker, can be used to identify prostate cancer. However, it is difficult to detect sarcosine in urine or plasma because of its low concentration. In this work, we describe a simple strategy for the preparation of sarcosine biosensor based on platinum-loaded mesoporous nickel phosphonate (Pt/MNP) and subsequently apply it to detect sarcosine. Mesoporous structure could increase the active sites on the MNP surface, which makes the Pt/MNP have excellent electrochemical performance for detecting hydrogen peroxide, one of the enzymatic products, and the sarcosine biosensor exhibited a superior electrochemical performance. The linear range of sarcosine biosensor is from 5 to 40 mu M and the sensitivity is 123.51 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). The limit of detection is estimated to be 0.24 mu M (S/N = 3). Additionally, the sarcosine biosensor based on Pt/MNP also shows an excellent performance in the anti-interference test and the real serum sample. This work manifests the potential application of Pt/MNP as a novel biosensor material for sarcosine detection, which could be extended to other oxidase-based detection systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ranolazine (RZ) is an anti-anginal drug with a distinct mechanism of action and widely employed in patients with chronic angina. Its measurement is essential in clinical environment to ensure adequate drug level and understand the redox mechanism which gives an idea of in-vivo fate of the drug. In view of this, an exemplary voltammetric approach is proposed here for determination of RZ utilizing glassy carbon electrode (GCE) fabricated with WO3 decorated graphene nanocomposite. The structural and morphological characterizations of modifier were made by employing XRD, FESEM, EDAX, HRTEM, XPS, Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy which revealed successful formation of the nanocomposite. As a result of high electrical conductivity and large effective surface area of WO3 nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets, the developed sensor WO3/Graphene/GCE displayed effectual and unrelenting electron interceding behavior exhibiting higher peak currents at lower potentials for RZ oxidation. Using square wave voltammetry, the drug showcased well-defined voltammetric response in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 4.5 in concentration range from 0.2-1.4 mu M and 1.4-14 mu M with the low detection limit of 0.13 mu M. The developed protocol was then implemented successfully to quantify RZ in commercially accessible pharmaceutical tablets with satisfactory recovery (99.8%-100.2%). The experimental results illustrated the applicability of the fabricated sensor for drug quality control and clinical analysis along with pharmacokinetic studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB One of the most critical problems of point-of-care testing is how to reduce the interference of background, especially under resource-limited conditions when sample pretreatment is not available. In this work we report a potentiometric method for point-of-care testing with minimum background. The method is based on the principles of a concentration cell which is a type of galvanic cells. It is an electrochemical cell having two carbon electrodes. The potential of each electrode is determined by ratio of a redox couple (i.e. Fe(CN)(6)(4-/3-)) on the electrode surface. On one electrode, the adsorbed enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of analyte by Fe(CN)(6)(3-) which produces Fe(CN)(6)(4-). The shift of the potential was because of the analyte as well as the background. In the other channel, no enzyme was present so that the shift of the potential, if any, is owing to the background. By measuring the potential difference between the two electrodes (i.e. voltage of the concentration cell), analyte can be quantitatively determined with most of the background eliminated. As the proof-of-concept analyte, blood glucose is quantitatively detected using a voltammeter with acceptable selectivity and accuracy. Noble metal electrodes that are indispensable for conventional electrochemical sensing are not required. All these features simplify the fabrication procedure and reduce the cost for the detection. Therefore, we believe it is promising for electrochemical point-of-care testing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   PRECURSOR
AB Lately, an "all-in-one" strategy via direct pyrolysis of protic salt has attracted great attention in the preparation of hetero-doped porous carbons due to its distinctive simplicity. However, protic salt derived carbons usually process large grain sizes thus hamper their applications. Herein, a protic salt derived N, S co-doped porous carbon (N, S-PC) with improved porosity was synthesized by nanocasting and carbonization of protic salt. In the nanocasting silica sphere was used as auxiliary template and an easily obtained protic salt ([pPDA][nHSO(4)]) was served as C, N and S sources. The obtained N, S-PC contains rich N, S contents and hierarchical textural porosity, thus favors the electrochemical detection of toxic cadmium ions. The N, S-PC based sensor shows excellent sensitivity and selectivity for Cd(II) versus other metals, with a low detection limit of 0.1 mu g L-1 (S/N = 3) over a wide concentration range of 4-80 mu g L-1. Applications of the N, S-PC based sensor for Cd(II) assay in tap water samples achieved results with good recoveries, indicating that the N, S-PC based electrode is promising in real sample analysis.

AB Tristeza is one of the destructive diseases of citrus causing by citrus tristeza virus (CTV). Historically, CTV has been associated with serious outbreaks of quick decline of citrus, therefore CTV monitoring is important aspect for avoiding such re-emerging epidemics, which would threat citrus production through the world. In this context, we have designed for the first time a label-free impedimetric biosensor for the detection of nucleic acid of CTV. The sensing platform based on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was modified by electrodeposited gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which allowed to efficiently immobilizing thiolated ssDNA probes as well to enhance the electrode conductivity. The growth of AuNPs was optimized and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We investigated the behavior of thiolated ssDNA probe layer and its hybridization with target DNA onto AuNP surfaces by EIS measurements in Fe(CN6)(4-)/Fe(CN6)(3-) red-ox system. The main sensor design aspects such as AuNPs size, probe DNA concentration and immobilization time together with DNA hybridization time were optimized so as to achieve the best performance. Impedance values of DNA hybridization increased with Citrus tristezarelated synthetic DNA concentration, showing a logarithmic relation in the range of 0.1-10 mu M. The results also indicate that the biosensor was able to selectively detect CTV nucleic acids in the presence of other non-specific DNAs. Moreover, we have demonstrated the good performance of the system in a real plant sample matrix. In addition, the sensor reproducibility enhanced after the hybridization onto MCH/poly (AT) thiolated DNA probes which was confirmed by intra-and inter-day variability assays. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Supramolecular solvent (SUPRAS) extraction is gaining attraction as a sample treatment technique because of its great performance in terms of effectiveness, versatility, sample clean-up, quickness, cost and sustainability. However, the nature of SUPRASs, being formed by amphiphile molecules, results in poor compatibility with Gas Chromatography (GC). Here, we show the hitherto unexplored development of a SUPRAS with high thermal stability (HTS) suitable for subsequent direct analysis by Headspace (HS)-GC. This novel HTS-SUPRAS, based on poly-undecylenic acid -an oligomeric surfactant-, tetraglyme -a polar aprotic solvent with excellent chemical and thermal stability- and water, was fully characterized in terms of composition and physical properties such as thermal stability. Subsequently, the HTS-SUPRAS developed was further successfully applied, as a proof-of-principle, to the extraction and determination of residual solvents in pharmaceutical drugs, including several solvents (class 2C) whose analysis by HS-GC has been shown to be highly complex. Analytical performance was demonstrated as mandated by the International Council for Harmonisation of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH). Furthermore, excellent recoveries (70-120%) and high precisions (<20%, expressed as relative standard deviations) were obtained for the analysis of several different drug formulations spiked with the analyzed 37 residual solvents at their respective maximum residue levels.

AB The development of an accurate and rapid diagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB) to use at point of need is vital to efforts aimed at reducing the global burden from this disease. This paper builds on our previous studies of mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) as a serum biomarker for active TB infection by means of a heterogeneous immunoassay. That work found that complexation with components in serum (e.g., proteins) sterically hindered the capture and/or labeling of ManLAM in an immunoassay at levels <10 ng mL(-1), compromising the clinical utility of this biomarker for detection of active TB infection. We also showed that the acidification of ManLAM-containing serum samples with perchloric acid improved the detectability of ManLAM by 250 x by complex disruption when compared to measurements of untreated serum. The present study examined what effects the PCA treatment of serum samples may have on the recovery and structural integrity of ManLAM, owing to its potential susceptibility to acid hydrolysis. Recovery was assessed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The possible impact of acid hydrolysis on the ManLAM structure was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and carbohydrate chemical degradation methods. The ELISA study indicated that while the signal strength for ManLAM in the serum spike-in experiments was significantly stronger after PCA pretreatment when compared to untreated human serum, it was only similar to 20% of the ManLAM measured in physiological buffer. This loss in detectability was shown by structural analysis to arise mainly from the acid-induced degradation of the arabinan domains of ManLAM that are targeted by antibodies used for antigen capture and/or tagging. The implications of these findings in terms of the detection of this important biomarker for TB are also discussed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, a novel high throughput screening method for antioxidants was described. The screening process was completed on a 5 cm x 5 cm silica gel 60 plate. Luminol was used as the fluorogenic substrate while hydrogen peroxide employed to excite the chemiluminescence. A dark spot was observed due to quenching effect of antioxidant. A linear model of the integral area of the spot as a function of analyte amount was fit by using vitamin C as positive control. Excellent linearity (R-2 = 0.9978) was obtained in the range of 2.31-23.1 mu g. The variation coefficients of intra- and inter-chip precisions were below 5% (n = 10) and 10% (n = 6) respectively. The new method was validated by comparing the analysis result of six flavonoids with that from a sequential injection method. The Pearson correlation coefficient was up to 0.98. A set of traditionally used herbal medicines was screened, and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma showed the strongest signal. The major bioactive ingredients were further assigned by flow injection and MS analyses. These results reveal the prospects of the proposed method to supply a promising tool in vitro for high throughput screening and activity evaluation of antioxidants in a fast, low-cost and reliable manner.

AB By analyzing multiple gene panels, next-generation sequencing is more effective than conventional procedures in identifying disease-related mutations that are useful for clinical decision-making. Here, we aimed to test the efficacy of an 84 genes customized-panel in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative patients. Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this study. DNA libraries were prepared using a picodroplet PCR-based approach and sequenced with the MiSeq System. Highly putative pathogenic mutations were identified in genes other than the commonly tested BRCA1/2: 2 pathogenic mutations one in TP53 and one in MUTYH; 2 missense variants in MSH6 and ATM, respectively; 2 frameshift variants in KLLN, and ATAD2, respectively; an intronic variant in ANPEP, and 3 not functionally known variants (a frameshift variant in ATM a nonsense variant in ATM and a missense variant in NFE2L2). Our results show that this molecular screening will increase diagnostic sensitivity leading to a better risk assessment in breast cancer patients and their families. This strategy could also reveal genes that have a higher penetrance for breast and ovarian cancers by matching gene mutation with familial and clinical data, thereby increasing information about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genetics and improving cancer prevention measures or therapeutic approaches.

AB This work demonstrates a sensitive and rapid method for the detection of antibiotic residues in food samples by employing the filtration behaviour of paper combined with aggregation and precipitation of chemical reagents. Using this concept, we successfully determined the presence of oxytetracycline and norfloxacin residues in pork using metal complexation on microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs). The base substrate (top layer of the device) was fabricated by printing letter channels of the words "oxytetracycline" and "norfloxacin" before functionalization with copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate in 0.5 M sodium hydroxide and iron (III) nitrate nanohydrate in 5 mM ammonia solution for the detection of oxytetracycline and norfloxacin separately. A transition metal hydroxide formed upon reaction that created solid precipitates on paper and allowed antibiotic residues to bind to the metal ions via coordination chemistry. The metal ion-antibiotic complex could form on the filter paper and generated a visible color change with the detection limit of 1 ppm for both oxytetracycline and norfloxacin in pork. This procedure of filtration and concentration in combination with a simple text-reporting approach allows the end users to achieve a low limit of detection as well as easy result interpretation in food safety monitoring.

AB Metal nanoclusters protected by glutathione (GSH) have attracted a wide attention due to the unique aggregation-induced emission (AIE) feature. However, the "trigger" effects of ethanol, temperature, pH values, and metal ions may restrict the application of these particles. In this work, the amino modified silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) and GSH-capped gold nanoclusters (GSH-AuNCs) can self-assemble into well-defined spherical particles due to the electrostatic interaction. As a result, the unique aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of GSH-AuNCs arises at 570 nm, and the SiNPs keep their own blue fluorescence at 450 nm, so a novel nanohybrid probe (SiNPs@GSH-AuNCs) with dual-emission property has been constructed. When protamine is added to SiNPs@GSH-AuNCs, the cationic protamine can compete with SiNPs and absorb onto the surface of GSH-AuNCs, which inhibits the self-assembly and leads to the fluorescence quenching of GSH-AuNCs; while trypsin can catalyze the hydrolysis of protamine, the self-assembly starts again, producing the AIEE recovery. In the whole process, the SiNPs act as an internal standard and their emission stays constant. By means of the fluorescence intensity ratios I-570/I-450, the linear range of protamine is from 0.15 to 3.00 mu gmL(-1) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.07 mu gmL(-1), and trypsin shows a linear response in the range from 10 to 100 ngmL(-1) with LOD of 4.50 ngmL(-1). Furthermore, this strategy exhibits good sensitivity and selectivity, and has been further validated by applying it for the determination of protamine and trypsin in serum samples.

AB Current in vitro bioassays of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, a major threat carcinogen) are relied on murine cells and fluorescent probe 7-ethoxyresorufin (7-ER), in which TCDD mostly causes abnormal expression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1). However, for human cells, TCDD mainly leads to a distinct abnormal expression of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). The poor response of 7-ER to CYP1A2 limits the traditional bioassay for human cells. Herein, we report a fluorescent probe N-(3-hydroxybutyl)- 4-methoxy-1,8-naphthalimide (HBMN) for in vitro bioassay of TCDD with human cells. HBMN had ca. 60 times higher affinity to CYP1A2 than 7-ER. As such, the sensing sensitivity increased by 10 times, and different expression of CYP1A2 by TCDD induction in different human cells was found. Besides, HBMN was also feasible in rapid screening of TCDD concentration by naked eye. It would open a new way to highly sensitive detect TCDD and understand the pathogenesis of TCDD in different human organs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A rhodamine B-based derivative (RL1) was developed as a specific fluorescent probe for HOCl. Meanwhile, morpholine moiety was introduced into the probe. It was found that the probe could display highly selective, sensitive and naked-eye detection upon the addition of HOCl. And the detection limit (LOD) was calculated to be as low as 2.8 nM. Furthermore, cellular confocal microscopic studies revealed that the introduction of morpholine moiety realized the lysosome-targeting capability. Moreover, RL1 was successfully applied for the imaging of endogenous HOCl with low cytotoxicity. Therefore, all the desirable features made probe RL1 particularly suitable for HOCl detection in aqueous buffer solution samples as well as the bio-imaging applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a field amplified sample injection (FASI) and hydrophobic interaction electrokinetic chromatography (HIEKC) method has been developed for the separation of five macrolide antibiotics: spiramycin, ivermectin, tylosin, josamycin, rapamycin, and one ansamycin drug - rifamycin. By the manipulation of both the sample and separation buffer compositions, their pH values and molarity, a systematic approach has been achieved to maximize analyte differential electrophoretic mobility and signal amplification. The impact of the sample solution composition and the injection mode on the signal amplification effect of the six tested antibiotics was also investigated. Moreover, the influence of the injection of the sample and the water plug on the quantity, symmetry and height of the analyte signal was demonstrated. All the analytes were completely resolved in less than 8 min in an uncoated fused-silica capillary of 75 mm internal diameter (I.D.) x 50 cm length. The electrophoretic separations were performed in a 60% (v/v) acetonitrile and 20 mM phosphate electrolyte system (pH 7.1) with an applied voltage of 25 kV. The established method was validated and confirmed to be applicable for the determination of the active ingredients in a quality control analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchically porous monoliths as a key feature of biological materials have been applied in enrichment and separation. In this work, a metal immobilized hierarchically porous organosilica hybrid monolith was synthesized by hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and diethoxyphosphorylethyl-triethoxysilane (DPTS) under alkaline environment. Phosphonate ester groups were firstly introduced by the employment of DPTS as functional monomer, and then acidified to phosphonic acids. The surface area of optimal monolith could reach to 1170 m(2)/g, which simultaneously contained micropores and mesopores (4 nm) obtained from nitrogen sorption measurement. Meanwhile, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) further demonstrated that macropores (1-3 mu m) existed in monoliths. Followed by chelating with titanium ion (Ti4+), the hierarchically porous organosilica hybrid monoliths could be applied as IMAC materials. This synthesized process was easy-operating and timesaving, and avoided the tedious and complex process of traditional Ti4+- IMAC materials. Furthermore, the Ti4+-IMAC monoliths exhibited high adsorption capacity for pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (82.6 mg/g). The 3282 unique phosphopeptides could be identified from 100 mg of HeLa digests after enrichment with the monolith, exhibiting excellent enrichment performance of low-abundance phosphopeptides.

AB Mechanical biosensors can be used to quantitatively explore DNA-protein binding mechanisms by detecting targets at low concentrations or measuring force in single-molecule force spectroscopy. However, restrictions in single-molecule manipulation and labelling protocols have hindered the application for bulk analysis of label-free protein detection. Here, we present the integration of molecular force measurement and finely tunable detection of label-free proteins into one mechanical sensor. Regulatory-sequence force spectroscopy was obtained to investigate the binding force of DNA G-quadruplexes (GQ) and label-free protein. The dual control of regulatory sequences and mechanical forces induces the structure switching from DNA duplex to GQ/protein complex. It exhibits a synergistic effect, enabling the rational fine-tuning of the dynamic range for biosensing protein concentrations over eight orders of magnitude. Furthermore, this method was exploited to estimate the stability of the human telomeric DNA GQ by Ku protein and ligand methylpyridostatin. The results revealed that human telomeric GQ has two different binding sites for Ku protein and ligand. Force spectroscopy integrating label-free force measurement and tunable target detection holds great promise for use in biosensing, drug screening, targeted therapies, DNA nanotechnology, and fields in which GQ are of rapidly increasing importance.

AB In this review, an assessment of non-separative methods based on mass spectrometry used to analyse volatile organic compounds in the field of bioanalysis is performed. The use of non-separative methods based on mass spectrometry has been established as an attractive option for analysing compounds. These instrumental configurations are suitable for biomedical applications because of their versatility, rapid output of results, and the wide range of volatile organic compounds that can be determined.
   Here, techniques such as headspace sampling coupled to mass spectrometry, membrane introduction mass spectrometry, selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry, proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, secondary electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and ion mobility mass spectrometry, are evaluated. Samples involving non-invasive methods of collection, such as urine, saliva, breath and sweat, are mainly considered. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive review of all the non-separative instrumental configurations applied to the analysis of gaseous samples from all matrices non-invasively collected has not yet been carried out.
   The assessment of non-separative techniques for the analysis of these type of samples can be considered a key issue for future clinical applications, as they allow real-time sample analysis, without patient suffering. Any contribution to the early diagnosis of disease can be considered a priority for the scientific community. Therefore, the identification and determination of volatile organic compounds related to particular diseases has become an important field or research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This tutorial aims at providing guidelines for analyzing metallic nanoparticles (NPs) and their dispersions by using methods based on miniaturized liquid chromatography with diode array detection (MinLC-DAD) and coupled on-line to in-tube solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME). Some practical advice and considerations are given for obtaining reliable results. In addition, this work outlines the potential applications that set these methodologies apart from microscopy-related techniques, dynamic light scattering, single particle ICP-MS, capillary electrophoresis, field-flow fractionation and other chromatographic configurations, which are discussed and mainly seek to accomplish size estimation and NP separation, speciation analysis and quantification of mainly AgNPs and AuNPs. MinLC-DAD has the potential to estimate the NP concentration and from it the average size of unknown samples by calibrating with a single standard, as well as studying potentially non-spherical particles and stability-related properties of their dispersions. While keeping the signal dependency with concentration and increasing the method sensitivity, IT-SPME-MinLC-DAD goes further allowing for the assessment of the dispersant effect and ultimately changes in the nanoparticle surroundings that range from modifications of the hydrodynamic diameter to the exposure to different reagents and matrices. The methodology can still be improved by either exploring newer IT-SPME adsorbents or by assaying new system configurations. Taking into account that this technique gives complementary information in relation to other techniques discussed here, this tutorial serves as a guide for analyzing metallic NPs towards a better understanding of the particle behavior under different scenarios.

AB A core element in clinical diagnostics is the data interpretation obtained through the analysis of patient samples. To obtain relevant and reliable information, a methodological approach of sample preparation, separation, and detection is required. Traditionally, these steps are performed independently and stepwise. Microchip capillary electrophoresis (MCE) can provide rapid and high-resolution separation with the capability to integrate a streamlined and complete diagnostic workflow suitable for the point-of-care setting. Whilst standard clinical diagnostics methods normally require hours to days to retrieve specific patient data, MCE can reduce the time to minutes, hastening the delivery of treatment options for the patients. This review covers the advances in MCE for disease detection from 2008 to 2017. Miniaturised diagnostic approaches that required an electrophoretic separation step prior to the detection of the biological samples are reviewed. In the two main sections, the discussion is focused on the technical setup used to suit MCE for disease detection and on the strategies that have been applied to study various diseases. Throughout these discussions MCE is compared to other techniques to create context of the potential and challenges of MCE. A comprehensive table categorised based on the studied disease using MCE is provided. We also comment on future challenges that remain to be addressed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB DNA amplification usually takes place in an aqueous system to facilitate a highly efficient reaction. Therefore, it is a challenge to connect the DNA amplification with popular dry chemical methods, whose signal outputs usually come from a solid-liquid interface. Here, by linking catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) with electrochemical biosensors through clickable nucleic acids, we develop a facile method for the detection of liver cancer related short gene MXR7. On one hand, the method maintains the advantages of CHA especially its high efficiency by performing the whole process of CHA in aqueous phase. On the other hand, the method realizes electrochemical detection of MXR7 by transferring a clickable double-helix production of MXR7-triggerd CHA to a dibenzocyclooctyne-functionalized electrode quickly through copper-free click chemistry. In comparison with traditional biotin-streptavidin or hybridization-assisted conjugation, the click chemistry allows quick response in a quarter of an hour, shortening the detection time greatly. In addition, owing to the lower steric hindrance as compared with streptavidin, the signal intensity is strong, making a sensitive detection possible. The detection limit reaches 125 fM, better than previous electrochemical methods. Results also reveal that CHA in solution has much better efficiency than that on interface, allowing two orders of magnitude improvement in detection limit (125 fM vs. 50 pM) with a shorter detection time (135 min vs. 165 min). This work also provides a novel concept to connect aqueous amplification system with interfacial detection method for other bioanalysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we discuss about the entropy generation minimization in a slip-modulated electrically actuated transport through an asymmetrically heated microchannel. While investigating the underlying thermo-hydrodynamics towards minimizing the irreversibility of the system under present consideration, we take the combined effects of Joule heating and the conjugate transfer of heat into account in this analysis. We primarily focus to tune the relevant thermo-physical as well as geometrical parameters towards minimizing the global irreversibility of the system. We show that the cooperative-correlative effects of the temperature gradient (between walls and fluid) and viscous dissipation in the system, as modulated by the slipping hydrodynamics stemming from the interfacial electrochemistry and Joule heating effects originating from higher conduction currents, bring in a change in the underlying thermal transport characteristics of heat, leading to an alteration in thermodynamic irreversibility in the system. We unveil optimum values of geometrical and thermo-physical parameters for which a change in thermal transport of heat as triggered by the viscous dissipation and joule heating effect leads to a minimum entropy generation in the system. Moreover, we show that the ionic concentration of the electrolyte present in the fluid can fetch a reduction in the irreversibility as well. We believe that the insights gained from this analysis may be useful for constructing the well-optimized futuristic micro heat exchanging systems/devices, typically used in MEMS.

Selective PILs were synthetized from the [VC6IM][Cl], [VC16IM][Br], and [(VIM)(2)C-10]2 [Br] - ionic liquids -by in-situ thermal-initiated polymerization in a fused silica capillary column for in-tube SPME. The synthesis procedure was optimized, and the capillary columns were characterized using spectroscopic and chromatography techniques. The chemically bonded and cross-linked PIL-based sorbent phase (thickness coating: 1.7 mu m) presented high chemical and mechanical stability. Among the sorbents evaluated, the PIL-based capillary, [VC16IM][Br]/[(VIM)(2)C-10]2 [Br] presented the best performance with a sorption capacity of 37,311 ng cm(-3) and 48,307 ng cm(-3) for AEA and 2 A G, respectively. This capillary was reused more than ninety times without significant changes in extraction efficiency. The in-tube SPME-UHPLC-MS/MS method presented a linear range from 0.1 ngmL(-1) to 100 ngmL(-1) for AEA, and from 0.05 ng mL(-1) to 100 ngmL(-1) for 2 A G, with coefficients of determination higher than 0.99, p-value for Lack-of-fit test higher than 0.05 (alpha of 0.05), precision with coefficient of variation (CV) values ranging from 1.6 to 14.0% and accuracy with relative standard deviation (RSD) values from -19.6% to 13.2%. This method was successfully applied to determine AEA and 2 A G in plasma patients with Parkinson's disease. The concentrations in these plasma samples ranged from 0.14 to 0.46 ngmL(-1) for AEA and from <0.05 ng mL(-1) to 0.51 ng mL(-1) for 2-AG. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a novel molecularly imprinted stir-bar was developed for the stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) of thiabendazole (TBZ) and carbendazim (CBZ) from orange samples. Magnetic nanoparticles were surface modified with oleic acid and then encapsulated by a silica shell using a conventional sol-gel procedure. Subsequently, nanoparticles were functionalized with methacrylate functionalities by grafting onto the particles surface. Finally, the modified magnetic nanoparticles were entrapped in a polymer monolith synthetized by copolymerization with the imprinting polymerization mixture using a glass vial insert as a mold. Variables affecting the polymerization and rebinding conditions of target analytes were optimized. The uptake capacity for the template (TBZ) was evaluated as well as the cross-reactivity for the related compound CBZ by rebinding experiments. Finally, the proposed magnetic imprinted monolith was applied to the SBSE of TBZ and CBZ from orange sample extracts providing a remarkable clean-up ability. The calculated detection limit were 0.13 and 0.10 mg kg(-1) for CBZ and TBZ respectively, low enough to satisfactory analysis of both compounds in orange samples according to current European Union regulations.

AB In this work, we presented a facile elution-free method for ultrasensitive enrichment of glycopeptides using two kinds of novel Ce-metal-organic frameworks (Ce-MOF) post-modified with hyaluronic acid (Ce-MOF@HA) and glutamic acid (Ce-MOF@Glu). Both of the synthesized materials remained stable in the loading buffer to enrich glycopeptides selectively and degrade in the eluent to release captured glycopeptides. Due to the dissolution of materials, the elution step of the enrichment process is omitted, resulting in an extremely high sensitivity (detection limit, 0.5 fmol/mu L). Meanwhile, Ce-MOF@HA and Ce-MOF@Glu also possessed excellent selectivity with molar ratios of IgG and BSA digests being 1:1000 and 1:500, respectively. Noticeably, the practical applicability of the obtained materials was inspected by analyzing the glycopeptides enriched from human serum (2 mu L) by nano-LC-MS, in which 434 N-glycopeptides from 182 N-glycoproteins (by Ce-MOF@HA) and 328 N-glycopeptides from 135 N-glycoproteins (by Ce-MOF@Glu) were detected, respectively. This work provides a new method to simplify the process of glycopeptides enrichment and also paves a novel way for the enrichment of trace targets from complex matrices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Isothermal nucleic acid amplification (INAA) techniques such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and isothermal multiple-self-matching-initiated amplification (IMSA) constitute simple and rapid approaches for the detection of pathogens. However, due to the employment of multiple primers, the detection of LAMP and IMSA products is easily influenced by high background signals from primer dimer-based nonspecific nucleic acid amplification (NSA) products. Moreover, time-consuming sample preparation steps are often required for the isolation of sufficiently pure nucleic acid prior to INAA. To address these drawbacks, hydrophobic magnetic ionic liquids (MILs) were used to rapidly preconcentrate DNA from complex biological samples followed by direct amplification by LAMP and IMSA. Careful control of the components within the isothermal buffer permitted direct addition of DNA-enriched MIL to the INAA reaction mixture, thereby circumventing tedious purification procedures that are ordinarily required prior to downstream DNA amplification. When added directly to INAA reactions, MIL solvents released metal ions that ultimately inhibited the primer dimer-mediated NSA, resulting in a flat or decreased baseline signal in no-template control samples and short threshold time for positive reactions. Using a MIL-based single droplet DNA extraction method, MIL-enhanced INAA reaction system, and a handheld 3D printed device for visual detection of the amplified product in customized tubes, we demonstrate the potential of the MIL-based approach for the onsite analysis of DNA from pathogens.

AB The separation of some zwitterionic, basic and neutral antibiotic and antiretroviral compounds was studied using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) on bare silica, bonded amide and urea superficially porous phases. The differences in the selectivity and retentivity of these stationary phases were evaluated for compounds with widely different physicochemical properties (logD -3.43 to 2.41 at (w)(w)pH 3.0). The mobile phase was acetonitrile-ammonium formate buffered at low (w)(w)pH. Compounds containing quinolone and serine groups showed poor peak shapes on all columns, attributed to metaloxide interactions with system metals. Peak shapes were improved by addition of citrate buffers. Gradient elution, particularly with regard to column equilibration, was also studied due to the large differences in retention factors observed under isocratic conditions. Full equilibration in HILIC was slow for both ionogenic and neutral solutes, requiring as much as similar to 40 column volumes. However, highly repeatable partial equilibration, suitable for gradient elution, was achieved in only a few minutes. Pronounced selectivity differences in the separations were shown dependent on the partial equilibration time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As there are more target categories on tumor cells/tissues than on receptor-overexpressing cells, and tumor tissues can better simulate TME, we established a new method of screening multi-target antitumor drugs by nonimmobilized tumor cells/tissues capillary electrophoresis under approximately tumor physiological environment. In this method, the natural structure and active conformation of the target proteins on tumor cells/tissues can be well maintained without separation and purification. Therefore, we successfully used this method to study the interactions between the Aidi injection (ADI)/its main components and tumor cells/tissues by optimizing a series of experimental conditions, discovered seven components with binding activity to A549 cells, five of them with specific interaction to tumor tissues, and calculated the binding kinetic parameters (K, k(a), k(d), and k'). Then, antitumor activity assays in vitro and in vivo were carried out to discover a new drug combination with higher targeting, better pharmaceutical efficacy, and lower toxic side effects. Finally, molecular docking studies were performed to investigate the potential target groups of the interactions between the effective drug combination and A549 cells/tissues. In summary, the method was verified to be valid and feasible, and can be easily transferred to a capillary array electrophoresis for high-throughput drug screening. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB An efficient method for the determination of amphetamine (AM) and methylamphetamine (MA) using electro-enhanced single-drop microextraction (EE-SDME) and gas chromatography has been developed. One advantage of this method is that the extraction efficiency is greatly enhanced by the electric field acceleration of the mass transfer of target analytes from the sample solution to the organic solvent drop. In addition, the extracted analytes were in situ derivatized with isobutyl chloroformate (IBCF) in the droplet, which further improved the sensitivity of this method. Under the optimum conditions, the enrichment factors (EFs) for AM and MA were 247 and 782, respectively. The proposed method exhibited low limits of detection (0.27 mu g/L for AM and 0.14 mu g/L for MA) and good linearity over the concentration range between 1 and 2000 mu g/L with regression coefficients (r(2)) of more than 0.99. The intra- and interday recoveries were from 89.6 to 96.2% and 82.7-90.5%, respectively, and the intra- and interday precisions (RSDs) were from 5.2 to 8.3% and 8.9-12.8%. The proposed method was applied to the determination of amphetamines in a urine sample. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous, in situ detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in biological milieu is made possible with electrochemical methods, but direct amperometry is constrained by the generation of elemental sulfur as an oxidative byproduct. Deposition of a sulfur layer passivates the working electrode, reducing sensitivity and causing performance variability. Herein, we report on the use of a surface preconditioning procedure to deposit elemental sulfur on a glassy carbon electrode prior to measurement and evaluate performance with common analytical metrics. The lack of traditional anti-poisoning techniques (e.g. redox mediators, cleaning pulses) also allowed for facile surface modification with electropolymerized films. For the first time, a series of electropolymerized films were characterized for their H2S permselective behavior against common biological interferents. Highly selective, film-modified electrodes were then evaluated for their anti-biofouling ability in simulated wound fluid. The final optimized electrode was capable of measuring H2S with a low detection limit (i.e., <100 nM) and similar to 80% of its initial sensitivity in proteinaceous media. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A simple, sensitive and rapid method of carvacrol determination using Boron Doped Diamond Electrode (BDDE) and Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) was described. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first presentation of electrochemical method to determine this compound on BDDE. In presented conditions, carvacrol undergoes irreversible one-electron oxidation controlled by diffusion. The measurement conditions and composition of supporting electrolyte were developed and optimized. Optimal measurement parameters were achieved using 0.1 molL(-1) acetate buffer pH 6.0 as supporting electrolyte. The calibration graph was linear from 0.29 to 15.03 mgL(-1) of carvacrol, the detection limit was 0.02 mgL(-1) with the correlation coefficient of 0.9990. The influence of interfering metal ions, such as Cd2+, Cr3+ and Pb2+, was studied. The influence of thymol on the measurement results was also examined. The proposed method was verified by successful determination of carvacrol in commercially available oregano essential oil. Recovery of carvacrol added to the extracts obtained from fresh and dried parts of oregano and marjoram was successfully estimated. Effective application of the described analytical approach, not only enables the electrochemical detection of carvacrol, but also helps to reduce the operational cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Structural identification is challenging in mass spectrometric imaging because of inadequate sample quantities and limited sampling time in each pixel for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments, which are usually used for the generation of fragment ions. We report herein the observation of a cascade of highly specific chemical bond cleavages via a low-energy photoelectron activated radical relays and a competed hole oxidization on surfaces of (Bi2O3) (0.07)(CoO) (0.03) (ZnO)(0.9) semiconductor nanoparticles irradiated with the 3rd harmonic (355 nm) of the Nd 3+: YAG laser. Distinguished from high energy electron impact (El), this approach generates gaseous radical anions through the exothermic capture of low-energy tunneling electrons that are not able to cause extensive vibrational excitations. It was found not only original radical center but also secondary or even tertiary radical centers cause specific bond cleavages exclusively on alpha positions. The original radical center directly activates the cleavages of alpha-positioned chemical bonds that cause the formation of secondary radical centers. Ion fragmentations proceed along the newly formed radical centers that further activate the cleavages of their alpha-positioned chemical bonds. Using 8 compounds, we have demonstrated various radical reactions involved in desulfonation, cyclization, and ring contraction reactions as well as competed hole oxidization-generated hydroxyl radical substitution reactions. The interpretable fragment ions provide unambiguous experimental evidences for structural elucidation of drug residues and metabolites in mass spectrometric imaging of tissue slices without tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).

AB Endocannabinoids (ECs) are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors [cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2)]. Many ECs have been characterized; anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) are still considered the primary ECs signaling mediators. Dysregulation of ECs has been implicated in a wide range of pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding how ECs participate in neurological diseases is important to describe the pathology and to establish new treatments. Considering the physicochemical properties of ECs, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry has become the reference method to determine these endogenous substances, in trace levels, in different biological samples. This review describes the recent advances in LC-MS/MS methods designed to determine ECs in complex biological matrixes. The advantages, limitations, selectivity, matrix effect, and sensitivity associated with each approach are emphasized. This article comprises three sections: (I) sample preparation techniques (conventional, microextraction, and online systems), (II) chromatographic methods (especially LC-MS/MS), and (III) relationship between ECs levels and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB The pivotal role of microfluidic technology in life science and biomedical research is now widely recognized. Indeed, microfluidics as a research tool is unparalleled in terms of its biocompatibility, robustness, efficient reagent consumption, and controlled fluidic, surface, and structure environments. The controlled environments are essential in assessing the complex behavior of cells in response to microenvironmental cues. The strengths of microfluidics also reside in its amenability to integration with other analytical platforms and its capacity for miniaturization, parallelization and automation of biochemical assays. Following previous review on the applications of microfluidic devices for cell-based assays in 2006, we have monitored the progress in the field and summarized the advances in microfluidic technology from 2007 to 2017, with a focus on microfluidics development for applications in cell manipulation, cell capture and detection, and cell treatment and analysis. Moreover, we highlighted novel commercial microfluidic products for biomedical and clinical purposes that were introduced in the review period. Thus, this review provides a comprehensive source for recent developments in microfluidics and presents a snapshot of its remarkable contribution towards basic biomedical research and clinical science. We recognize that although enormous amounts of evidence have reinforced the promise of microfluidic technology across diverse applications, much remains to be done to realize its full potential in mainstream biomedical science and clinical practice.

AB The problem of reproducibility of scientific research is a serious issue in biomedical sciences. In addition to experimental repeatability, limiting the (pre-) analytical variance is also essential. To address this problem in the field of metabolomics, we have designed KIMBLE, the KNIME-based Integrated MetaB-oLomics Environment, a novel platform for the processing and analysis of NMR metabolomics data. It consists of an elaborate NMR metabolomics workflow in the KNIME workflow management system that handles both targeted and untargeted metabolomics. The workflow provides a self-documenting way of transforming raw time-domain NMR data into metabolic insights. Parameters for the quantification of a number of interesting metabolites in urine are included in the workflow, and several useful statistical analysis and visualization tools are incorporated as well. The workflow comes with an interesting sports-induced ketosis dataset so that new users can easily get acquainted with the platform. The user is free to adapt and extend the workflow to his or her personal needs. The KIMBLE workflow, the KNIME software and all the required libraries are installed in a VirtualBox virtual machine that allows for facile installation and use by non-experts. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Microfluidic gradient generators have been employed in several works in the literature. However, these are typically application specific and especially limited in the range of flow rates that result in the required concentration gradient outputs. Here, a flow rate independent gradient generator designed as a modified Christmas tree-like microfluidic channel network including micromixers at each channel branch is demonstrated. The device was characterized theoretically, modeled using finite element analysis and tested experimentally. Input flow rates up to 200 mu l/min, resulting in a maximum speed of about 333 mm/s, for the generation of linear and mirrored linear gradients were demonstrated.
   As an application example, the gradient generator was monolithically integrated with microfluidic free-flow electrophoresis for the separation/concentration of fluorophores using a novel E-field gradient free-flow electrophoresis mode. The separation of fluorophores, having different charge stages, showed concentration factors of up to 10 fold. In addition, an extended theoretical description of the realizable concentration gradients and the electric field gradient is presented as supplementary information. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Use of paper-based devices for affordable diagnostics is gaining interest due to unique advantages such as affordability, portability, easy disposability and inherent capillarity. As capillary transportation is an integral component of paper-based devices, low sample volume with faster measurement becomes an additional advantage. We have developed a simple, paper-based microfluidic device suitable for measuring the viscosity of Newtonian fluids as well as a few non-Newtonian fluids with sample volume as little as 12-20 mu L. The results could be obtained much faster than the conventional methods. A comparative analysis of the results obtained with our paper-based viscometer and with that of the conventional Ostwald viscometer shows a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99. Apart from viscosity measurement, the paper-based devices were tested for protein denaturation and polymer molecular weight determination. Our results show that the paper-based viscometer could be a potential alternative for the conventional viscometers in the viscosity range from 0.9 cP up till similar to 40 cP, with added benefits in terms of time, cost and low sample volume requirement.

AB Bladder cancer (BC) is a common malignancy, and it accounts for one of the highest management costs among urogenital cancers. As a non-invasive method, urine cytology plays an important role in the detection of exfoliated tumor cells (ETCs) for early diagnosis of BC. However, urine cytology suffers from its low sensitivity and reliance on microscopic examination. To address this issue, an integrated filtration device was developed with a pore size of 5 mu m that isolated and enriched ETCs from discarded urine samples, and then quantified ETCs using a microchip ELISA method. The results revealed that the number of urinary ETCs from BC patients (n = 35) was obviously higher than the number of ETCs from healthy donors (n = 20). The ROC curve showed that the integrated filtration microfluidic device had a sensitivity of 77.1% when the specificity was set at 90% in identifying BC patients. Thus, the integrated filtration device holds great potential for the screening of BC or the follow-up analysis of treatment efficacy in point-of-care (POC) settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A label-free electrochemical DNA sensor based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-immobilized on a paper-based analytical device (PAD) was developed. Unlike previous PNA-based electrochemical PAD (ePAD) sensors where the capture element was placed directly on the electrode, acpcPNA was covalently immobilized onto partially oxidized cellulose paper allowing regeneration by simple PAD replacement. As an example application, a sensor probe was designed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) detection. The ePAD DNA sensor was used to determine a synthetic 15-base oligonucleotide of MTB by measuring the fractional change in the charge transfer resistance (R-ct) obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The R-ct of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) before and after hybridization with the target DNA could be clearly distinguished. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to verify the EIS results, and showed an increase in peak potential splitting in a similar stepwise manner for each immobilization step. Under optimal conditions, a linear calibration curve in the range of 2-200 nM and the limit of detection 1.24 nM were measured. The acpcPNA probe exhibited very high selectivity for complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch and non-complementary DNA targets due to the conformationally constrained structure of the acpcPNA. Moreover, the ePAD DNA sensor platform was successfully applied to detect PCR-amplified MTB DNA extracted from clinical samples. The proposed paper-based electrochemical DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative device for low-cost, simple, label-free, sensitive and selective DNA sensor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB On-site spatial variation study of airborne trace metals has been known to be the key to providing a comprehensive evaluation of air pollution information at any targeted location. However, the existing portable approaches either do not allow sample analysis in the longitudinal direction or is not yet practically applicable due to due to the lack of a portable detection method. In this paper, by integrating paper based colorimetric detection via cellphone and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in-air sampling, we present an approach for on-site multiaxial quantification of airborne trace metals in an arrayed format. Using a self-built sampler mounting on a UAV, our approach enables automatic, multiaxial air PM sampling. In addition, by relying only on a cellphone and a custom-made field reaction kit, samples collected in-air can be readily processed, detected in an arrayed format and interpreted on-site within 30 min. Finally, an ultrafast batch-to-batch paper microfluidic chip fabrication protocol enables 48 chips to be fabricated under 30 s at a cost of 1.92 $, making the approach well-suited for disposable on-site use. Our system was first calibrated for 6 metals commonly found in airborne PM (i.e. Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Cr and Ni), and the corresponding metals detection limits were found to be 8.16, 45.84, 1.86 x 10(2), 10.08, 1.52 x 10(2) and 80.40 ng. The validity of our approach was then demonstrated by characterizing 6 metals commonly found in air PM using a certified ash sample, and the experimentally determined metal weight percentage showed a good agreement with the manufacture certified value. Finally, the approach was used for on-site airborne trace metals spatial variation study at 4 difference locations in Fuzhou City (China), thus demonstrating the significance of our approach in supplementing air pollution information gathering and progressing rapid, on-site air toxicity assessment research.

AB Gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based colorimetric sensor is sensitive for the detection of metal ions and metal oxyanion in aqueous solution. However, this method is usually not suitable for multi-objective analysis in complex mixture systems because it is suffering from interference of co-existents. In the present paper, we proposed a sensitive, flexible, low-cost, and multi-units sensor method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of metal ions and metal oxyanion based on the global ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) spectra of amino acid-gold nanoparticles (amino acid-AuNPs) sensors in the range of 230-800 nm. Different amino acids (L-Histidine, L-Lysine, L-Methionine, D-Penicillium) which can prevent the aggregation of the AuNPs in NaCl solution, were investigated to build sensor arrays responding to different ions induced AuNPs aggregation. The UV-Vis spectra that Cd2+, Ba2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Cr3+, Cr2O3, Sn4+, Pb2+ induce amino acid-AuNPs displayed different characteristics and the ions were classified correctly by using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Taking the advantage of the multivariate analysis and sensor arrays, we simultaneously quantified the ions in binary and ternary mixture systems (Cr3+/Cr(2)O(7)2(-), Fe2+/Cd2+, Fe3+/Cr3+/Cr2O72-). Data fusion methods further improved the prediction accuracy of the chemometric models built on multi-amino acids-AuNPs sensors. The proposed method has a potential for analyzing metal ions and metal oxyanion in much more complex mixture systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a rapid Raman assay for on-site analysis of stockpiled drugs in aqueous solution. This approach was tested on Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate). Tamiflu is a drug approved by the FDA for treatment of influenza and is the most common antiviral included in stockpiles for use in the event of a national emergency. Rapid assays were performed on three concentrations (30, 45, and 75 mg) of oseltamivir using three different portable & handheld Raman instruments. PLS regression models were developed to establish a calibration curve and applied to the Tamiflu samples. Raman assay values were compared against the standard HPLC assay to demonstrate the viability of this approach, yielding an average assay value within 0.3% of that obtained from the HPLC analysis for the 35 different capsules analyzed. The Raman method demonstrates the potential for rapid screening of stockpiled pharma- ceuticals on-site using portable Raman instrumentation and readily available consumables for sample preparation. In addition to routine screening to ensure product quality past the expiration date, this approach could also be used to assist in rapid deployment of such medications in the case of a national emergency.

AB We report one-step in situ laser-induced synthesis of the conductive copper microstructures doped with iron, zinc, nickel, and cobalt with highly developed surface area. It was observed that the presence of chlorides of the aforementioned metals in the solutions used in our experiments increases the deposition rate and the amount of copper in the resulting deposits; it also leads to the deposit miniaturization. The laser deposition from solutions containing cobalt (II) chloride of concentration more than 0.003 M results in fabrication of copper microelectrode with better electrochemical properties than those deposited from solutions containing chlorides of other metals of the same concentration. Moreover, copper microelectrode doped with cobalt has demonstrated good reproducibility and long-run stability as well as sensitivity and selectivity towards determination of hydrogen peroxide (limit of detection-0.2 mu M) and Dglucose (limit of detection-2.2 mu M). Thus, in this article we have shown the opportunity to manufacture two-phase microcomposite materials with good electrical conductivity and electrochemical characteristics using in situ laser-induced metal deposition technique. These materials might be quite useful in development of new perspective sensors for non-enzymatic detection of such important analytes as hydrogen peroxide and glucose. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present study, we developed a phage-based real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) methodology for sensitive diagnosis of bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii). An isolated A. baumannii phage p53 was used for Taqman qPCR through detecting phage replication in live A. baumannii cells in serum samples. At the phage concentration of 10(3) PFU/mL, the sensitive detection of A. baumannii (down to 10 CFU in 100 mu L serum) has been obtained within 4 h in spiked serum samples without bacteria isolation and DNA extraction. Subsequent testing of 22 simulated serum samples spiked by different strains has shown that the results from the phage-based Taqman qPCR method have 100% agreement with the spiked concentrations of the bacteria. The assay built in this study, gathering all the advantages for detections of high rapidity, high sensitivity, good specificity, being able to detect only live bacteria not dead bacteria and no DNA extraction or purifications, can be developed to detecting other bacterial pathogens in serum or other complicated samples through switching to other types of phages and realize the rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria in BSI, which would potentially be applied for fast diagnosis in sepsis clinically.

AB As alkaline phosphatase (ALP) plays crucial roles in disease warning and dephosphorylation-related cellular regulation, it is widely recognized as an important biomarker for clinical diagnosis. In this work, we proposed a facile colorimetric assay based on phosphate anion-quenched oxidase-mimicking activity of Ce(IV) ions for sensitive and selective detection of ALP activity. Free Ce(IV) ions exhibited a strong oxidase-like capability (providing a 40-fold catalytic turnover number compared with CeO2) to catalyze the oxidation of colorless 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into its blue product TMBox mediated by dissolved O-2 at neutral pH, thus triggering a remarkable color reaction visually. When PO/ was added, its strong affinity to Ce(IV) ions rapidly precipitated the free Ce(IV) ions, resulting in the quenching of their enzymatic ability. Given that ALP catalyzed the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate to produce PO43-, determination of ALP activity could be achieved using the colorimetric assay with no need of complicated instrumentation and protocol. As demonstrated, our assay offered a highly sensitive readout for ALP activity in two linear scopes of 0-50 U L-1 and 50-250 U L-1, providing a detection limit down to 2.3 U L-1. Besides, it could provide specific response toward ALP against other enzymes and biological species. Furthermore, the developed assay was successfully applied to evaluate ALP activity in human plasma accurately and reliably, indicating its great promise as a powerful and convenient tool for monitoring of ALP activity in clinical practice.

AB This work demonstrated an effective strategy for the capture, identification and determination of multiple types of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) on functional and biocompatible immunomagnetic nanosphere interfaces (IMNs). The IMNs were achieved by functionalizing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanospheres (Fe3O4) with polymerized ionic liquid (PIL), and then coating with epithelial-cell-adhesionmolecule antibody (anti-EpCAM). The IMNs exhibited outstanding cell capture efficiency (above 95%) and specificity when employed to separate multiple EpCAM-positive tumor cells, due to the abundant carboxyl groups in the structure of PIL, which enhanced the coupling efficiency of MNs with anti-EpCAM by chemical bonding between carboxyls and amines, thereby enabling more target cells adhered onto IMNs. Under the optimized capture conditions, IMNs were shown an excellent cell capture performance in the range of 5-400 cells/mL in three different cases (e.g., PBS, MCF-7 and THP-1 mixed cell suspension, lysed blood). More significantly, our results indicated that with modification of PIL, in addition to the capture efficiency, the cell viability rate of CTCs was also greatly improved (98%) owing to the nontoxic and biocompatible properties of PIL, which realized the proliferation of the rare number CTCs for further molecular characterization. Finally, the IMNs were successfully applied to the isolation and detection of CTCs in cancer patient peripheral blood samples and as low as one CTC in the whole blood was captured and identified by the ICC method.

AB Owing to their pronounced polarity, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) can be considered as the elective choice for the LC analysis of aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics.
   In the present work, a gradient program was optimized for the first time with a diol-type stationary phase and an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD), thus allowing the almost complete separation of the nine analysed AGs: spectinomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, streptomycin A, gentamicin Cl, amikacin, kanamycin A, paromomycin, apramycin and neomycin.
   In the optimized analysis conditions, analyte retention was found to be governed by a multimodal mechanism encompassing electrostatic, partitioning and hydrophilic interactions. However, the gradient mode of elution complicated a deep understanding of the influence of each contribution on the retention behaviour.
   The developed HILIC-ELSD method was applied for the analysis of commercial tablets containing neomycin co-formulated with the polypeptide antibiotic bacitracin. The method was fully validated according to the guidelines enshrined in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH).
   The use of the diol-type stationary phase was well suited for implementing a successful 2D-HPLC system. Indeed, in order to cope with the absence of chemoselectivity for the couples amikacin/kanamycin and paromomycin/apramycin, a successful 2D-HPLC method was implemented with the "heart-cut" approach and the use of either heptafluorobutyric (for the former) or perfluorooctanoic acid (for the latter) as the ion-pair reagent in the second RP-LC dimension.

AB Antibody-based pharmaceuticals often encompass a complex structural heterogeneity requiring enhanced analytical methods for reliable characterization of variants and degradation products. We have explored the capabilities of low-flow sheathless capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) for the high-resolution and sensitive profiling of antibody therapeutics. Near-zero electroosmotic flow was achieved by employing a novel neutral capillary coating that also prevents protein adsorption. CE-MS analysis of intact model proteins using an acidic background electrolyte demonstrated satisfactory performance, with overall migration-time RSDs below 2.2% from three different capillaries tested. For system evaluation, three nanobody preparations, including mono- and bivalent forms, and three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were analyzed. Intact nanobodies were resolved from their degradation products, which could be assigned to deamidated, cleaved, and truncated forms at the C-terminal tag. Excellent resolution of isomeric deamidated products was obtained. The mAbs were analyzed intact and after digestion by the endoproteinase IdeS (middle-up approach). CE-MS of intact mAbs provided resolution of clipped species (e.g. light chain and light chain-heavy chain fragments) from the native protein. Moreover, glycoforms containing sialic acids were resolved from their non-sialylated counterparts. For IdeS-digested, F (ab)(2) and Fc/2 portions where efficiently resolved for the three mAbs. Whereas the migration time of the Fc/2 fragments was fairly similar, the migration time of the F (ab)(2) part was strongly varied among the mAbs. For all mAbs, separation of Fc/2 charge variants - including sialylated glycoforms and other post-translational modifications, such as loss of C-terminal lysine or asparagine deamidation - was achieved. This allowed a detailed and reliable assessment of the Fc/2 heterogeneity (18-33 proteoforms) of the three analyzed mAbs. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A sensitive, simple, and environmentally friendly online three-step stacking strategy combining field-enhanced sample injection, sweeping and micelle to solvent stacking has been developed to determine trace amounts of organic anionic analytes in complex biological samples. A green ionic liquid, 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, was first introduced as a micellar solution and used for electroosmotic flow reversal in this stacking strategy. The mechanism of stacking has been discussed, and parameters affecting three-step stacking preconcentration efficiency have been optimized. The capillary coated with an ionic liquid was easy to prepare, regenerable and repeatable (RSD<2.16%) and yielded a high efficiency. Under optimal conditions, the sensitivity improvement increased up to 2424-fold when compared with the normal capillary zone electrophoresis mode. The peak shape and separation efficiency of the model basic organic acids showed a significant enhancement when compared to traditional capillary zone electrophoresis. The optimized method showed great potential for quantitative analysis of trace concentration analytes in complex matrices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We proposed an innovative surface modification-mediated porous layer open tubular ( PLOT) capillary, which was modified via an in situ biphasic reaction. This capillary comprised three-dimensional homogeneous and porous structures, which could increase the surface-area-to-volume ratio for antibody immobilization. The PLOT capillary was shown as an ideal immunoreaction base to enhance the sensitivity of immunoassays and shorten analysis time. By connecting two separate PLOT capillaries using a suitable sleeve tube, we can perform multiplex targets detection in the same sample. We developed a sensitive, rapid, and multiplex PLOT capillary-mediated immunosensor for the simultaneous identification of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in clinical serum samples with good accuracy. The detection sensitivity of the PLOT immunosensor improved by 10-fold compared with that of bare-capillary sensor, and the whole analysis could be completed within 1 h. This work suggest that suitable surface modification strategy is an effective tool to improve the analytical performance of conventional immunoassay and our study provided a feasible, sensitive, and multi-target assay for the detection of cancer biomarkers, which would be of valuable application in clinical diagnosis.

AB An electrochemical nitrite sensor based on electrochemically reduced holey graphene (ERHG) was fabricated in this study. An abundant of nanopores were observed on the basal plane of the ERHG, and, with the aid of in-plane pores, many more exposed edge plane and a high density of defects were found. Both these phenomena can significantly improve the electron transfer and mass transport of electrodes. The ERHG-modified electrode showed superior electrocatalytic activity toward nitrites with a wide linear range, high sensitivity, and a low detection limit. Furthermore, the ERHG nitrite sensor showed excellent anti-interference ability and reproducibility, long-term stability, and fulfilled requirements for application to real samples.

AB We demonstrate the use of a dendrimer functionalized graphene oxide ( GO) to fabricate a novel sensitive ferrocene-terminated poly(amine) ester dendrimer (Fc-AED)-GO modified glassy carbon electrodes (Fc-AED/GO/GCE) for direct quantification of Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in liquor sample. GO sheets were grafted on the Fc-AED molecules by the esterification reaction between carboxylic end group in Fc-AED and hydroxyl group on GO sheets so as to form Fc-AED-GO composites. Construction of electrochemical sensors using the structure of nanosized dendrimer can provide compact matrix for the incorporation of GO to improve the adhesion of GO on electrode, which would be more possible for the design of sensor to improve the film forming performance and then increase the electrochemical activity of the electrode. Additionally, it can directly use the redox probe of ferrcene to sense the content variation of analyte. The GO also provides a larger surface area to facilitate deposition of Fc-AED redox probe resulting in the increased current response of the modified sensor. The modified sensor exhibites a wide linear response to DEHP and a low detection limit of 0.06 mu M with higher sensitivity, good selectivity, and a better reproducibility promising to be a useful tool in the DEHP evaluation. The outstanding performance of the developed sensor could be attributed to the synergistic effect of Fc-AED and GO. Possible redox mechanism of DEHP on Fc-AED/GO/GCE are proposed based on experimental results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The study of low abundant proteins contributes to increasing our knowledge about (patho) physiological processes and may lead to the identification and clinical application of disease markers. However, studying these proteins is challenging as high-abundant proteins complicate their analysis. Antibodies are often used to enrich proteins from biological matrices prior to their analysis, though antibody-free approaches have been described for some proteins as well. Here we report an antibody-free workflow on the basis of strong cation exchange (SCX) enrichment and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for quantification of the soluble Receptor of Advanced Glycation End-products (sRAGE), a promising biomarker in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). sRAGE was quantified in serum at clinically relevant low to sub ng mL(-1) levels. The method was validated according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines and was compared to an antibody-based LC-MS sRAGE method. The SCX-based method builds upon the bipolar charge distribution of sRAGE, which has a highly basic N-terminal part and an acidic C-terminal part resulting in an overall neutral isoelectric point (pI). The highly basic N-terminal part (pI(calculated) = 10.3) allowed for sRAGE to be enriched by SCX at pH 10, a pH at which most serum proteins do not bind. This study shows that ion exchange-based enrichment is a viable approach for the LC-MS analysis of several low abundant proteins following a thorough analysis of their physical-chemical properties.

AB In the context of human and veterinary drugs identification, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) may provide a relevant complementary piece of information to mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), the so-called collision-cross-section (CCS). Up to now, however, the application of CCS as identification parameter has not been fully investigated due to the reduced number of these drugs that have being characterized in terms of CCS. This work proposes a CCS database for 92 human and veterinary drugs, including eighteen benzimidazoles, eleven 5-nitroimidazoles, eleven aminoglycosides, nineteen quinolones, eighteen beta-lactams, ten sulfonamides and five tetracyclines. Among them, 37 drugs have been characterized in terms of CCS for the first time. The CCS values of the other 55 compounds have been compared with those from a recently published database in order to evaluate inter-laboratory reproducibility, which is crucial for the implementation of the CCS as identification parameter. CCS values were measured by traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS) under positive ionization conditions. Nitrogen was used as drift gas in the ion mobility cell. The proposed database covers 173 ions including [M+H](+) and [M+Na](+) species. High correlation between m/z and CCS has been observed for [M+H](+) (R-2 = 0.9518, n = 91) and [M+Na](+) (R-2 = 0.9135, n = 82) ions. As expected, CCS values for sodium adducts are generally greater than for protonated molecules because they exhibit higher molecular weight. However, sodium adducts of aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and of several quinolones and benzimidazoles, were characterized as more compact ions than their related protonated molecule. In addition, this work describes the fragmentation pattern observed for the studied molecules. For the first time, the main fragment ions for most of the compounds have also been characterized in terms of CCS, involving a total of 238 ions. As proof of concept, for the application of this database to biological matrices, eleven veterinary drugs in bovine urine samples were characterized in terms of CCS, showing that this parameter was not influenced by the matrix.

AB In this study, a novel strategy based on the combination of 3D SERS and LIBS was developed for qualitative and quantitative detection of bacteria. SERS-active Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) were prepared by an improved in situ synthesis method, and reproducible SERS spectra of bacteria were obtained by natural evaporation of a droplet of the in situ synthesized sample. Four types of bacteria were classified via principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchy cluster analysis (HCA). LIBS acted as a quantitative technique for bacterial detection based on the intracellular mineral cations, and bacteria could be detected in a linear range of 5 x 10(3)-5 x 10(7) CFU mL(-1), with recovery values ranging from 81.0% to 101.7%. The whole detection process including sample preparation and detection could be completed in approximately 30 min. With short assay time and simple operation, the proposed strategy has showed great potential for bacterial analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A pulsed light emitting diode, coupled with a properly configured spectrometer is implemented in open source analytical ultracentrifugation detection hardware, allowing for spectral acquisition spanning the visible to near infrared. Details of the challenges arising with the new hardware are described, along with the necessary solutions to overcome them. The system is successfully tested with polystyrene and gold nanoparticles, demonstrating effectiveness for different material and particle geometries. Sedimentation coefficient distributions and analytically extracted spectra are presented for the multiwavelength datasets extending into the near infrared. Additionally, deconvolution algorithms are applied as a further demonstration of tools applicable to these datasets and the resolving power possible. The results of gold nanoparticle analysis presented here show effective near infrared spectral acquisition is now possible for multiwavelength analytical ultracentrifugation, opening the door for analysis of many important samples with spectral properties in this range, including rich classes of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles.

AB We demonstrate for the first time the development of a universal DNAzyme-based bioluminescent sensor for label-free detection of various biomolecules including DNAzyme and DNA. The presence of DNAzyme may induce the cyclic cleavage of riboadenosine (rA)-containing substrates, and the subsequent digestion of the cleaved substrates by exonuclease III (Exo III) releases abundant AMPs to initiate cyclic AMP pyrophosphorylation-ATP depyrophosphorylation for the generation of an enhanced bioluminescence signal. This sensor can real-time monitor the DNAzyme activity with a detection limit of 3.16 x 10(-12) M. Moreover, the DNAzyme may be divided into two subunits for sensitive detection of target DNA. In the presence of target DNA, the two separated subunits may assemble into an active DNAzyme which can catalyze the cyclic cleavage of substrates and initiate the digestion of cleaved substrates by Exo III for the generation of an enhanced bioluminescence signal. This sensor can sensitively detect target DNA with a detection limit of 3.31 x 10(-12) M. Importantly, this bioluminescent sensor can achieve a zero-background signal, and its output signal originates from the release of AMP for the generation of self-illuminating light emission without the requirement of either the external labels or the reporting reagents.

AB In this work, a three-phase composite material consisting of SiO2-coated Cu-MOF, single layer graphene, and aniline was synthesized. In the presence of ammonium persulfate as an oxidant, the aniline component of this mixture was polymerized to polyaniline to bridge Cu-MOF and graphene in the composite. Hence, a new sensory material with a highly porous nature (MOF) and superior conduction properties (graphene/polyaniline) was constructed. More specifically, the inclusion of Cu-MOF in the matrix facilitated the acquisition of an electrochemically active sensory material with a high surface area of about 756m(2)/g. The potential application of this porous semiconducting material was demonstrated for sensitive detection of ammonia in a linear detection range over 1-100 ppm with a low limit of detection of 0.6 ppm.

AB A novel and highly sensitive method based on bio-barcode with rolling circle amplification (RCA) was developed for the detection of T-2 toxin. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were modified with anti-T-2 monoclonal antibody and single-stranded thiol-oligonucleotides (SH-ssDNAs) and magnetic microparticles (MMPs) coated with T-2 antigen. The T-2 toxin competes with the antigen on MMPs for the anti-T-2 antibody on AuNPs. Then, the isolating complex system was separated by a magnetic field, and the DNA of the probes was released after washing in dithiothreitol solution. The barcode DNA via RCA and products were stained by SYBR Green I and then detected by fluorescence spectrophotometry. The optimized method was performed on oats, millet, flour, and other substances. This method exhibits a low limit of detection (0.26 pg mL(-1)) and linear range of 0.002-200 ngmL(-1). Moreover, the approach offers good recovery and relative standard deviations ranging from 88.65% to 10.04% and 0.6%-13.1%, respectively. In conclusion, this method exhibits potential for use as an ultrasensitive assay for the detection of a variety of small molecules in complex matrices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the quantitative analysis of 5-methylcytosine, a representative epigenetic modification in genomic DNA, with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We synthesized a novel hetero-bifunctional linker molecule consisting of nitrogen mustard and biotin to capture DNA on the surface of biosensing devices. The molecule can successfully immobilize genomic DNA on a streptavidin coated 96-well microplate, which was then employed for immunochemical epigenetic assessment. We achieved the sensitive and quantitative detection of 5-mC in genomic DNA samples. The CpG methylation ratios obtained from our system for mouse brain and mouse small intestine genomes were 79% and 82%, respectively. These numbers are in good agreement with the previously reported methylation ratio of 75-85%, which was identified by whole genome bisulfite sequencing. Accordingly, the present technology using our novel bifunctional linker molecule provides a fast, easy, and inexpensive method for epigenetic assessment, without the need for any conventional bisulfite treatment, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or sequencing.

AB Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) still faces a big challenge in bioanalysis due to the biological background interference and the poor reproducibility of the Raman signal. Accordingly, herein a novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe is prepared via the co-assembly of 3-(4-(phenylethynyl) benzylthio) propanoic acid (PEB) tagged-peptides and 4-thiol phenylacetylene (TPA) on gold nanorods, and used for the measurement of caspase 3, as a biomarker. A key advantage of this system is the lack of background alkyne signals throughout the cell. The two alkyne-bearing molecules produce distinct SERS signal but the PEB signal decreases in response to the peptide-cleavage activity of caspase 3, thereby allowing the ratiometric detection of analytes. Under the optimized conditions, the ratiometric peak intensity of I-2027/I-2218 dynamically increased with increasing caspase 3 concentration in the range from 12.5 to 500 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 1.99 ng/mL based on a signal-to-noise ratio of S/N = 3. The nanoprobe has been successfully applied in a live cell imaging assay of caspase 3 and in an ischemia-reperfusion surgery-treated rat living tissue model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pre-clinical diagnosis of many diseases required quantitative detection of Human Serum Albumin (HSA). Herein a high-selective HSA sensor RhHSA was picked through a two-round selectivity evolution from the typical "Effector-pi-Trigger" style. RhHSA suggested advantages including high selective (similar to 6 fold for HSA: BSA = 1: 10), sensitive (LOD similar to 5 nM, over 700-fold enhancement), steady (over 24 h) and wide linear range (0-0.5 mg/mL, applicative for conventional HSA measurement). The detecting system was free from media polarity or viscosity. HSA destruction, site competition and molecular docking provided reliable evidence for the fact that RhHSA could be embedded into both ibuprofen and phenylbutazone sites of HSA. These hints also supported the discrimination of HSA from BSA. Stepwisely fluid replacement in living cells and measuring in urine system both inferred the potential of RhHSA in biological applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a highly sensitive and selective chemiluminescence (CL) aptasensor was prepared for thrombin (THR) detection based on aptamer-conjugated and hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme signal-amplified carbon fiber composite (HG-DNAzyme/T-Apt/SiO2@GO@CF). Initially, SiO2@GO@CF was successfully prepared and characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). Thrombin aptamer (T-Apt) as an identification element and simulated enzyme-hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme (HG-DNAzyme) as a signal-amplified material, were applied in the CL aptasensor. Then, the immobilization properties of SiO2@GO@CF and adsorption properties of T-Apt/SiO2@GO@CF were studied. Lastly, HG-DNAzyme/T-Apt/SiO2@GO@CF was applied in construction of the CL aptasensor. When THR existed, HG-DNAzyme was desorbed from the surface of T-Apt/SiO2@GO@CF and catalyzed the CL system of luminol-H2O2. Under optimized CL conditions, THR was measured with the linear concentration range of 1.5 x 10(-14) to 2.5 x 10(-11) moL/L and the detection limit of 6.3 x 10(-15) moL/L (3 delta). The proposed CL aptasensor was used to the determination of THR in human serum samples and recoveries ranged from 99.0% to 102.4%. Those satisfactory results illustrated the CL aptasensor could achieve highly sensitive and selective detection of THR and revealed potential application in practical samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Flexible electrochemical sensors for measurement and quantification of biomarkers are attracting a great deal of attention in non-invasive medical applications, due to their high mechanical compatibility and conformability with the human body. Realization of the full potential of such novel systems relies heavily on their effective manufacturing. Particularly, there is a need for manufacturing techniques that can realize complex designs, consisting of multiple functional materials which are required for sensor functionality. Among emerging additive manufacturing techniques, Direct-Ink-Writing (DIW), where polymer nanocomposite inks are dispensed through nozzles and deposited with high spatial control, carries a great potential to address this need. Here, we introduce a 3D printed flexible electrochemical biosensor for glucose detection. We show that our biosensor works linearly in glucose solution with a concentration range between 100 and 1000 mM. The sensitivity of glucose biosensor is estimated to be 17.5 nA mu M-1, and the calculated value of the detection limit (S/N = 3) is 6.9 mu M. The demonstrated electrochemical performance and surface properties of the printed sensors show the promising advantages of using this technique over the conventional screen printing method. These advantages include higher sensitivity and specificity and, reduced material consumption. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Loop-mediated isothermal amplification is a promising method in the area of nucleic acid detection. However, it suffers from a high rate of false-positive amplifications that largely restrict its application. In this study, we observed gold nanoparticles (AuNP) absorbing single-stranded DNA primers and interacting with Bst DNA polymerase via electrostatic adsorption. As a result of these interactions, the presence of the gold nanoparticles exerted a hot-start effect on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification system. Based on these results, we developed a novel AuNP-mediated nucleic acid isothermal amplification assay. This assay displays significantly enhanced specificity-the proportion of false positive decreased from 76% to 0% and from 100% to 0% for the detection of rotavirus and the b-actin gene, respectively, with the hot-start temperature of 48 degrees C. Moreover, our AuNP-based assay maintained good sensitivity and a satisfactory detection limit (1 x 10(3)copies/L mu) compared with the conventional assay. This approach has the potential to solve the nonspecificity problem of loop-mediated isothermal amplification, thereby promoting its real-world application, particularly, in clinical settings.

AB A highly efficient method for eliminating terminal fixed region interference of aptamer with real-time monitoring of the SELEX process was described by silver decahedra nanoparticles probe (Ag-10-A(10-)RP(15)) capture and block the terminal fixed region candidates. A microarray chip was developed by immobilization of target protein (lipocalin-1 (LCN-1)) and control proteins (Human serum albumin (HSA), Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Holo-transferrin) on the biochip surface. The nucleic acid pool was first incubated with target and then captured by hybridization with Ag-10-A(10)-RP(15). The work allows rapid screening of aptamer elimination fixed-region interference, and the kinetic constants of candidate sequences can be quickly determined using SPRi technology. Eventually, ten aptamers with high affinity and specific for LCN-1 after only fifth-round of selection was acquired. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study a novel and reliable Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) measurement protocol for the elemental characterization of size-segregated particulate was developed. Special efforts were made to improve and optimize sample pre-treatment steps and LA operating conditions to avoid some critical drawbacks encountered during analysis and to make the particulate samples suitable for an accurate and reproducible LA-ICP-MS analysis, regardless of the mass loading on each filter. For example, a new approach for dust-fixation on the sample-carrier was developed using a glycerol coverage, which allowed to overcome problematic sample losses during the ablation process. Under the optimum conditions, dust samples, blank filters and standards for calibration were analyzed by multiple rastering of defined spot areas. Quantitative analysis was accomplished with dried micro-droplets of aqueous standard solutions. Derived method detection limits varied between 0.001 and 0.1 ng m(-3) and allowed even for the smallest particle fraction quantitative measurements. The accuracy of LA-ICP-MS results was verified by comparison with conventional ICP-MS analysis of selected PM samples after sample mineralization. The proposed LA treatment procedure benefits from a simple and fast sample preparation, thus overcoming the laborious pre-treatment steps required for wet chemical digestion. Moreover, the better sensitivity of the LA-ICP-MS approach provided more complete information about the mass concentration and size-distribution of the investigated elements, thus allowing to deeper investigate the composition of the most dangerous PM fractions in terms of health concern.

AB It is shown that a simple dynamic diffusion model of the boundary potential based on a separate, step-by-step, account of ion transfer across the membrane/aqueous solution interface and the diffusion processes within both phases which was proposed earlier for describing the response of ionophore-free membranes, can be successfully used for ionophore-based membranes as well. The model makes it possible to carry out both separate and joint account of the effects of co-extraction, transmembrane transport and ion exchange on the boundary potential and retains robustness in all the variants studied. The model adequately describes the ionophore-based electrode response over the entire range of concentrations and allows one to clearly demonstrate the dependence of lower detection limit on such parameters as the diffusion coefficients and the concentration of electroactive substances in the membrane phase, the thickness of the diffusion layer in the sample solution, the duration of the measurement, and the composition of the internal reference solution. The results of numerical simulation are in good agreement with the experimental data presented in the literature. As all the factors of influence considered above can easily be regulated in more or less wide limits, but at the same time, an estimation of their cumulative effect is not always possible on an intuitive level, the present model can be of practical interest for justifying the ways of optimizing the design of the ISE and the algorithm for performing measurements in solving specific analytical problems.

AB Mass spectrometry imaging is a valuable tool for visualizing the localization of drugs in tissues, a critical issue especially in cancer pharmacology where treatment failure may depend on poor drug distribution within the tumours. Proper preprocessing procedures are mandatory to obtain quantitative data of drug distribution in tumours, even at low intensity, through reliable ion peak identification and integration. We propose a simple preprocessing and quantification pipeline. This pipeline was designed starting from classical peak integration methods, developed when "microcomputers" became available for chromatography, now applied to MSI. This pre-processing approach is based on a novel method using the fixed mass difference between the analyte and its 5 d derivatives to set up a mass range gate. We demonstrate the use of this pipeline for the evaluating the distribution of the anticancer drug paclitaxel in tumour sections. The procedure takes advantage of a simple peak analysis and allows to quantify the drug concentration in each pixel with a limit of detection below 0.1 pmol mm(-2) or 10 mu g g(-1). Quantitative images of paclitaxel distribution in different tumour models were obtained and average paclitaxel concentrations were compared with HPLC measures in the same specimens, showing <20% difference. The scripts are developed in Python and available through GitHub, at github.com/FrancescaFalcetta/Imaging_of_drugs_distribution_and_quantifications.git. (C 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A photoelectrochemical catechol sensor using BiPO4 nanocrystals/BiOI (BiPO4/BiOI) heterojunction is developed. BiPO4/BiOI heterojunction is fabricated via a simple one-step solvothermal method with KI and ionic liquid 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium dihydrogen phosphate ([Omim]H2PO4). An enhanced photoelectrochemical separation efficiency is obtained due to the synergistic effect between the formation of BiPO4/BiOI heterojunction and shortening the transmission path of the electron to the surface caused by BiPO4 nanocrystals. Owing to the outstanding photoelectrochemical response of BiPO4/BiOI heterojunction to catechol, a photoelectrochemical sensor is constructed for monitoring catechol. The proposed sensor possesses reliable stability, anti-interference ability and a low detection limit with 2 ng mL(-1). The linear range is from 6 to 1.20 x 10(4) ng mL(-1). Notably, this work not only supplies a facile method for BiPO4 nanocrystals based binary heterojunction, but also helps to understand the relationship between BiPO4 nanocrystals and photoelectrochemical performance of binary heterojunction. Convincingly, this strategy can be extended to other BiPO4 nanocrystals based heterojunction and photoelectrochemical sensor platform associated with photoactive materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bimetallic Au-Ag/Co3O4 nanofibers (Au-Ag/Co(3)O(4)NFs) were synthesized by an electrospinning method and calcination treatment. Due to the admirable synergic effect of electrocatalytic ability of Au and Ag, and the large surface-to-volume ratio of Co3O4 nanofibers caused by their rough surface, the synthesized Au-Ag/Co(3)O(4)NFs were applied to a sensing platform for hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Using electrochemical techniques, the novel sensing platform based on Au-Ag/Co(3)O(4)NFs shows a wide linear concentration range with high detection sensitivity of 1241.1 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). This sensitive sensor was also applied to determine H2O2 from human breast cancer cells, indicating its great potential application in physiology and pathology. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The sensing performance of a Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer was significantly improved by controlling the film organization at the air-water interface. Cellulose acetate (CA) and 4-tert-butylcalix [6] arene (calix) were co-spread and formed a Langmuir film, which was efficiently transferred onto a preoxidized gold electrode, Au-ox. The modified gold electrode was applied as a fast, highly sensitive electrochemical sensing platform for the quantitative determination of a model molecule, dopamine (DA). The modified gold electrode, CA-calix/Au-ox, demonstrated better recognition and sensing ability towards dopamine as compared with electrodes modified by a single component. Under the optimized conditions, the reduction peak currents at the CA-calix/Au-ox increased linearly within the concentration range of dopamine from 5 to 100 and 100-7500 nM, and exhibited a very low limit of detection (LOD) of 2.54 nM (S/N = 3). These results suggest a simple, superior and efficient approach for the controllable rearrangement of Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers on a molecular level. The electroanalytical performance was optimized from the perspective of the electrode-electrolyte interface. (C 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Major cause of cervical cancer is a persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomaviruses (HPV). For that reason, HPV testing is now becoming an important addition to standard cytological screening of cervical malignancies in women (known as Pap test). New methods are sought which could offer rapid and inexpensive detection schemes, such as those based on electrochemical (EC) readout. Here, we developed an assay for parallel detection of two most oncogenic high-risk HPV types, HPV16 and HPV18, by combining loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) of template DNA, its separation using magnetic beads and detection with amperometry at carbon-based electrode chips. Our EC-LAMP test enabled us to successfully discriminate both HPV types not only in cancer cell lines, but also using clinical material obtained from HPV-positive patient samples.

AB Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a typical biomarker plays a remarkable role in various human physiological processes. A sensitive and rapid method should be developed to realize the precise diagnosis of cancer at its early stage. In this work, we successfully synthesized the peroxidase-like graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and utilized it to fabricate an enzyme-free electrochemical immunosensor towards CEA by forming a single-wall carbon nanotubes@GQDs (SWCNTs@GQDs) composite. In addition to the SWCNTs@GQDs, reduced graphene oxide-Au nanoparticles (rGO-Au NPs) with the huge specific surface area and excellent conductivity were employed to modify the electrodes, leading to a dual-signal amplification result. Both the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed to evaluate the interface properties of the layer-by-layer modified electrodes. The proposed electrochemical immunosensor displayed a good specificity and sensitivity towards the detection of CEA ranging from 50 pg mL(-1) to 650 pg mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 5.3 pg mL(-1). This simple and inexpensive immunosensor shows promising potential for the determination of other biomarkers in clinical translation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In anti-doping, a high number of classes of substances are prohibited and laboratories need to detect these at low urinary concentrations. Traditionally, testing is done using complimentary liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. High resolution mass spectrometric acquisition has some important advantages over triple quadrupole instruments (e.g., open screening due to full scan high resolution data acquisition with retrospectivity, compatibility with libraries and a straightforward and effortless addition and validation of new compounds in the future). Doping samples can be stored for 10 years and retrospective data analysis can be used to re-evaluate previously acquired data (e.g., searching for prohibited (designer) substances that were unknown at the initial moment of analysis). During the past decade, these advantages have led to the wide-scale transfer of liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry screening to liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry screening for doping control purposes. Up to now, for gas chromatography a similar switch to high resolution screening has not yet occurred, because so far no method has been developed that combines sufficient sensitivity with wide-scale drug detection.
   In this work, the current gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry screening method for human doping control purposes was successfully converted into an equivalent and complete gas chromatography high resolution acquisition screening method. This new screening method on a gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer has been developed and validated. The method is compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency requirements and allows the detection of 294 target compounds (and 14 internal standards), including diuretics, stimulants, narcotics, beta-2-agonists, beta-blockers, hormone modulators, anabolic agents and the quantification of 14 endogenous steroids in a single fast run (14.1 min).

AB Whisky is one of the most popular spirit drinks in the world. Unfortunately, this highly valued commodity is vulnerable to fraud. To detect fraudulent practices and document quality parameters, a number of laboratory tests based on various principles including chromatography and spectroscopy have been developed. In most cases, the analytical methods are based on targeted screening strategies. Non-targeted screening (metabolomics fingerprinting) of (semi) volatile substances was used in our study. Following the pre-concentration of these compounds, either by solid phase microextraction (SPME) or by ethyl acetate extraction, gas chromatography (GC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF mass analyser) was employed. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used for evaluation of data obtained by analysis of a unique set of 171 authentic whisky samples provided by the Scotch Whisky Research Institute. Very good separation of malt whiskies according to the type of cask in which they were matured (bourbon versus bourbon and wine) was achieved, and significant 'markers' for bourbon and wine cask maturation, such as N-(3-methylbutyl) acetamide and 5-oxooxolane-2-carboxylic acid, were identified. Subsequently, the unique sample set was used to construct a statistical model for distinguishing malt and blended whiskies. In the final phase, 20 fake samples were analysed and the data processed in the same way. Some differences could be observed in the (semi) volatile profiles of authentic and fake samples. Employing the statistical model developed by PLS-DA for this purpose, marker compounds that positively distinguish fake samples were identified. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An enhanced near-infrared (NIR) FRET biosensing system based on the novel donor-acceptor pair (MnCuInS/ZnS@BSA and urchin-like Au NPs) was developed for the sensitive detection of HER2 protein. In this strategy, MnCuInS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were chosen due to their NIR emission, high quantum efficiency, and low toxicity. Amounts of MnCuInS/ZnS QDs were encapsulated in BSA to form MnCuInS/ZnS@BSA nanoparticles, which can easily transfer MnCuInS/ZnS QDs from organic phase into aqueous solution, and the formed nanoparticles were applied as the energy donor which significantly enhanced the fluorescence intensity. As for the energy acceptor, urchin-like Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) with novel structure, good stability and excellent quenching ability towards NIR fluorescence were selected. Thus, the NIR MnCuInS/ZnS@BSA and urchin-like Au NPs were designed as a novel donor-acceptor pair for FRET assay. By combining the optical advantages of NIR QDs encapsulated BSA nanoparticles with the excellent fluorescence quenching ability of urchin-like Au NPs, the proposed FRET-based biosensor realized enhanced FRET effect for highly sensitive detection of HER2 in human serum samples. A wide detection range (2-100 ng mL(-1)) and a low detection limit (1 ng mL(-1)) were obtained. This sensing system can decrease the interference of other biomolecules in NIR region, can be applied to other biomarker determination in vitro, and also shows great potential for in vivo diagnosis.

AB A low temperature plasma integrating the merits of small size, simple operation and rich active particles has good performance in analytical chemistry. In this work, a point discharge microplasma was used as a reactor to facilitate the gaseous conversion reaction from H2S to SO2 with an excellent efficiency as high as 95%. By coupling this reactor with a fluorescence spectrometer, the speciation analysis of sulfide and sulfite was achieved in a simple, chromatographic separation-free, time-saving and practical way. Specifically, with the discharge off, only sulfite was quantified; with discharge on, both sulfide and sulfite were quantified; and with a simple subtraction, the speciation analysis could be easily attained. By the acidification process, a limit of detection of 7.7 mu M by the proposed method was obtained for both sulfide and sulfite in aqueous medium, and this method was successfully utilized to analysis of real samples.

AB In this paper we describe a label-free biosensor for coralyne, prepared by combining DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs) with an exonuclease III amplification strategy. An artificial DNA probe having a polyadenine (poly-A) sequence at both the 3'- and 5'-ends was used as a probe to detect coralyne. In the absence of coralyne, the probe existed in a hairpin conformation that left both its 3'- and 5'-ends free. In the presence of coralyne, two adjacent adenine (A) bases in the poly-A sequence of the probe formed an A(2) unit and then coordinated with coralyne through non-Watsone-Crick base pairing. The DNA probe, having captured coralyne, was subsequently digested by exonuclease III, even though the distance between the A(2) units in the A(2)-ecoralynee-A(2) complex would be much larger than that found in common Watsone-Crick base pairing. After digestion, the DNA probe became a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) residue and released its captured coralyne. The liberated coralyne was then coordinated by another DNA probe having the hairpin conformation; as a result, many ssDNA residues formed after digestion. Two kinds of Ag NCs having different optical utilities were obtained: one corresponding to the hairpin conformational DNA probe and the other to the ssDNA residue. The difference in fluorescence intensity at 588 nm of these two kinds of Ag NCs reflected the concentration of coralyne. The linear range (on a logarithmic scale) for detecting coralyne spanned from 5 to 1000 nM, with an estimated detection limit of 1.83 nM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Development of selective, sensitive and non-enzymatic sensor for glucose determination is highly important for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Herein, we have reported the novel ultra sensitive and non-enzymatic sensor development by in-situ wraped NiO nanostructures (similar to 10-15 nm) on the sulfur-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (SDHCNSs) through hydrothermal-assisted process. The structural and morphological properties of the nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The prepared NiO@ SDHCNSs was directly used as an electrochemical sensor for glucose determination, and its performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and amperometric techniques. The fabricated nonenzymatic biosensor was exhibited remarkably good sensitivity (1697 mA mM(-1)cm(-2)), low detection limit (LOD) (52 nM), a wide linear range (up to 13 mM) of glucose with desirable selectivity, stability and reproducibility. Further, the constructed sensor has demonstrated an excellent anti-interference property in the presence of common interferences such as dopamine (DA), uric acid (UA) and ascorbic acid (AA). Most interestingly, the fabricated electrode is applicable for the practical analysis of glucose in the real blood serum and urine samples. The excellent electrochemical performances of NiO@ SDHCNSs towards the oxidation of glucose are attributed to the increased electron transfer passage through unique hollow spherical morphology with increased redox couple of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH derived from NiO. Thus, the improved electrochemical performances of NiO@SDHCNSs can be adopted as a potential electrode for the real sample analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The emergence of circulating miRNAs as potential biomarkers for cancer necessitates reliable approaches to detect miRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. We disclose a highly sensitive method for rapid and direct quantification of circulating miRNA in serum by combining dynamic DNA circuit and single-molecule fluorescence detection. The product of DNA circuits based amplification is detected by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). The single-molecule counting allows the quantification of miRNA targets. Owing to the high sensitivity for fluorophore labeled nucleic acids of TIRFM, the products generated by 15 min amplification are sufficient for quantification. Meanwhile, the fast detection also addresses the problem of leakage because non-target triggered DNA circuits is relatively slow. There miRNA biomarkers miR-141, miR-21, miR-16 were detected with remarkable sensitivity as detection limits of 0.017, 0.012, 0.006 fM, respectively. This approach was applied for the direct quantification of the circulating miRNAs in human serum. The results of 29 health samples, 18 prostate cancer samples, 23 breast cancer samples imply that miR-141 and miR-21 are up-regulated in the prostate cancer samples and the breast cancer samples, respectively, and as reference miR-16 shows no difference in health and patient samples.

AB High-efficient orange fluorescence nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) were facilely prepared from P-phenylenediamine as a precursor via hydrothermal method. The as-prepared N-CDs with an average diameter of 3.65 nm displayed excitation-independent emission at 590 nm. The N-CDs demonstrated a remarkable fluorescence enhancement behavior with the increase of pH. A sigmoidal curve was well fitted using BiDoseResp equation with pK(a1) 3.57 and pK(a2) 6.01, which can be ascribed to the unique surface properties of N-CDs. Two-segment linear ranges of 2.6-4.6 and 5.0-6.8 broaden the response range to pH of the orange-emission N-CDs to some extent. The confocal fluorescent microscopic images of SMMC7721 cells were performed successfully, which demonstrating that N-CDs possess exceptional cell membrane permeability and can implement as biosensing platform to monitor pH fluctuations in living cells.

AB An automatic micro-injector was developed for electrophoretic analysis of a microlitre amount of clinical samples, enabling injection of the sample from a Hamilton syringe. The outlet of the syringe needle is located directly opposite the inlet of the separation capillary at a defined distance of the order of hundreds of mm in the injection space. During the injection, the background electrolyte is forced out by air from this space and a drop of the sample is forced out of the syringe by a micro-pump so that it is caught at the entrance to the capillary. From the drop the sample is injected into the capillary by applying a negative pressure pulse or simply by spontaneous injection. The injection space is then filled with background electrolyte, which washes away excess sample and separation is commenced. The injector was tested in electrophoretic separation of a model sample with equimolar concentrations of 100 mu M NH4+, K+, Na+, Mg2+ and Li thorn in a short capillary with total/effective length of 16.5/11.5 cm. The repeat-ability of the migration time and peak area expressed as the RSD value is 2% and 4%, respectively. The practical applicability of the injector was verified on the determination of the antiparasitic pentamidine in 10 mu L of rat plasma. Electrophoretic separation of pentamidine was performed in 100 mM of acetic acid/NaOH at pH 4.55, the sample consumption per analysis is 125 nL, the separation time is 45 s and the attained LOQ using contactless conductivity detection is 8 mu M.

AB The paper deals with the development of an online UHPLC-MS/MS method for the identification and determination of 25 Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) belonging to different chemical classes (perfluorochemicals, bisphenols, alkylphenols, phthalates, and parabens). The study regards the possible EDC migration from different medical devices of diverse materials used in the routine hospitals for blood sampling or for the parenteral nutrition therapies. In order to evaluate the release of EDCs, the equipment used for blood sampling (syringes, butterfly, cannula-needle, microcapillary tube) was put in contact with a physiological solution at a prefixed time. As regards the migration tests carried out on the medical devices used in the parenteral nutrition therapy (infusion tubes, venous catheters), the catheters were undergone to internal contact with parenteral solution and external contact with physiological one, whereas the infusion tubes were subjected only to internal migration test with parenteral solution.
   The results demonstrated the released of some ECDs (such as parabens at the concentration of few pg mL(-1), diethylphthalate and dibutylphthlate at ng mL(-1), level), when using physiological solution as the leaching agent. In addition, the presence of a PFOS structural isomer was found at 29.0 ng mL(-1): this compound was released in part from the infusion tubes and mostly from the venous catheters, particularly from silicone ones. Using a more lipophilic solution, such as parenteral preparations, a greater amount of EDCs was released, among which also the diethylhexylphthalate that was quantified in all the investigated devices (without highlighting particular trends or migration from PVC devices), but its concentration remained always lower than imposed maximum threshold limit on medical device of 0.1% w/w.
   The releases from the infusion tubes of the same materials ( polyethylene) from different manufacturers are very comparable, whereas the catheter of silicone releases greater amount of EDCs than that of polyurethane. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dicationic ionic liquids (DILs) are more and more accepted as a new class of high temperature and polar stationary phases for gas chromatography (GC). This study deals with the effect of seven different fluorosulfonyl derivatized anions associated with two dications: 1,3-di(3-methylimidazolium)-2-methylpropane [2mC(3)(mim)(2)], and 1,3-di(3-methylimidazolium)-isobutene [i-eneC(4)(mim)(2)]. Thermophysical properties of the 14 synthesized DILs were evaluated in terms of melting point, viscosity, and thermal stability. The optimal physicochemical properties of 13 DILs allowed preparing 13 GC capillary columns. Accordingly, the polarity and selectivity of the DILs were evaluated by determining the Rohrschneider-McReynolds constants and the equivalent chain lengths of C18 fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The symmetrical fluoroalkylsulfonyl and the trifluorosulfonate anions seem to produce the most polar DILs. Compared to classical polyethyleneglycol phases, the DILs showed substantially decreased retention of apolar compounds and a much stronger retention of the polar ones. Unique selectivities were observed with unsaturated FAMEs, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and bacterial specific FAMEs. The two applications presented included a biodiesel and bacterial FAME analyses.

AB A poly(ethyleneimine) embedded phenyl mixed-mode stationary phase was prepared through epoxide ring opening reaction. Elemental analysis (EA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize whether functional groups have been modified on the surface of silica successfully. The researches of chromatographic performance for designed column were divided to four parts. The retention behavior under reversed-phase mode was studied using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), positional isomers and alkylbenzenes. The retention characteristic under hydrophilic interaction mode was studied by nucleosides, nucleobases and flavonoids. The chromatographic performance of anion exchange mode was evaluated by benzoic acids and phenols. Due to a high content of amino and phenyl groups on the stationary phase, aromatic amines were chosen for the evaluation of retention mechanisms of benzene ring attraction and amino repulsion. The investigations about effects of mobile phase constitution and pH on retention demonstrated the mixed-mode retention mechanisms of the column. Furthermore, due to amino selectivity of the column, a method for the rapid separation and determination of phenylenediamines in hair dye was established. And both linear correlation coefficients of p-diaminobenzene and m-diaminobenzene in concentration range from 0.1 to 30 mg mL(-1) were over 0.999. In conclude, the prepared mixed-mode stationary phase could realize various separation modes by adjusting chromatographic conditions, and it had the potential for the rapid separation and determination of aniline compounds in various complex samples.

AB The development of bioanalytical methods that provide early detection of the presence of cancer by sensitive and specific determination of biomarkers such as small biomolecules, nucleic acids, proteins, enzymes, and even whole cells are essential to improve opportunity for improved patient treatment and to diminish the rate of cancer mortality. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) methods have been increasingly used to develop bioassays that offer speed, selectivity and low detection levels with practicality that is appropriate for providing point-of-care measurements for screening. The unique optical and photophysical properties of fluorescent nanoparticles such as semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and other materials have been reported to operate as efficient donors and/or acceptors for replacement of fluorescent organic dye molecules in various FRET-based assays. This review is focused on the recent progress that has been made in the development of nanoparticle-based FRET bioassays, and considers nanoparticle synthesis, design of optical properties, conjugation chemistry and approaches to fluorescence detection that provide for selective and sensitive quantification of cancer biomarkers.

AB A sensitive and highly efficient approach to monitor the expression of proteins on live cells was urgently needed to demonstrate its factor and mechanism and most important for clinical diagnostics and molecular biology. Herein, we developed a simple and highly efficient strategy, nonlinear hybridization chain reaction (nonlinear HCR), for the sensitive determination of proteins on live cells with transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) and RAW264.7 cells as a model. Unlike the normal hybridization chain reaction (HCR) with multiplicative amplification, an exponential amplified fluorescent response could be obtained in theory based on the proposed nonlinear HCR. As a result, the nonlinear HCR generated a significant enhancement about 3 times compared with the normal HCR and 10 times compared with the directly immunofluorescence assay. Based on the proposed nonlinear HCR, the fluorescent signals increased with the concentration of TRPV4 in the range from 10 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL with a detection limit of 2.8 pg/mL, which would be useful for the sensitive detection of proteins in cell lysis or on cell surface. At the same time, the significant improvements via nonlinear HCR were achieved in the fluorescent imaging system compared with traditional immunofluorescence staining and normal HCR, proving the significant value of nonlinear HCR-based amplification strategy. Success in the establishment of the highly efficient nonlinear HCR strategy offered a simple and sensitive approach to demonstrate the concentration of special proteins on cell and other proteins and nucleotide potentially, revealing a simple and efficient technology for research fields of clinical diagnostics and molecular biology.

AB Robotic square wave voltammetry (SVW) in 24-well microtiter plates has been developed as a reliable non-manual procedure for quantifying drug release from pharmaceutical hydrogels. The assay was established using 1% agarose disks containing Paracetamol (R) (PCT) as a model preparation. Computerized buffer delivery and SVW in calibration and hydrogel sample wells were performed by a three-electrode arrangement combined with a thin plastic tube. For the glassy carbon working electrode of the assembly the upper limit of the linear response and the lower detection limit of sequential 'in-well' PCT-SVW were 1000 and 0.5 mu M, respectively. During non-stop runs through plate wells with equal drug titers the voltammetric PCT signal was stable for at least 6 h. For the construction of drug-release curves with triplicate data points PCT-SVW was performed sequentially on three identical hydrogel samples in neighboring plate wells, preceded and followed by sensor calibrations for response validation. The results showed bi-phasic PCT release profiles exhibiting an initial rapid loss of the drug near the surface of the gel, followed by slowly decelerating release of more deeply buried drug and the dissipation of the concentration gradient that drives diffusion. The proposed automation of voltammetric testing generates reliable hydrogel drug release profiles without the need for operator intervention, avoiding human errors from monotonous manual electroanalysis and releasing skilled staff for other work. This approach is therefore suggested as an economic option for hydrogel dissolution testing in academic or industrial R&D, particularly when the required multi-parameter optimization creates many samples.

AB Detecting and monitoring the pathogens with high selectivity and sensitivity is critical for public health. In the present study, we demonstrated a specific analytical strategy for sensitive detection of Leishmania infantum genome. The developed sensor utilized toluidine blue as a hybridization indicator and a Leishmania infantum-specific capture DNA sequence immobilized on a high-surface area gold nano-structure as an electrochemical transducer. The produced analytical response was based on the hybridization of the single-stranded DNA from the target with the immobilized DNA sequence at the electrode surface. The developed DNA sensor in this study was successfully employed to detect a synthetic Leishmania infantum target sequence in a wide concentration range from 1 x 10(-18) to 1 x 10(-10) mol L-1 with a detection limit of 0.2 amol L-1 with the ability to discriminate the target sequence from mismatched sequences. Moreover, the designed DNA sensor showed a good reproducibility and stability during repeated regeneration and hybridization cycles. The DNA sensor could detect Leishmania infantum genome in a wide concentration range from 15 to 50 ng mu L-1 with a detection limit of 29 ng mu L-1. Furthermore, clinical trials confirmed the applicability of the developed DNA sensor for practical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study describes, for the first time, the use of a batch injection analysis system with amperometric detection (BIA-AD) to indirectly determine salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) levels in saliva samples for chronic periodontitis diagnosis. A chemical/thermal treatment was explored to generate a CuO film on a Cu electrode surface. This procedure offered good stability (RSD = 0.3%), good repeatability (RSD < 1.3%) and excellent reproducibility (RSD < 1.5%). The sAA concentration levels were determined based on the detection of maltose produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of starch. The analytical performance was investigated, and a linear correlation was observed for a maltose concentration range between 0.5 and 6.0 mmol L-1 with a correlation coefficient equal to 0.999. The analytical sensitivity and the limit of detection were 48.8 mA/(mmol L-1) and 0.05 mmol L-1, respectively. In addition, the proposed system provided an excellent analytical frequency (120 analysis h(-1)). The clinical feasibility of the proposed method was investigated by the determination of sAA levels in four saliva samples (two from healthy control persons (C1 and C2) and two from patients with chronic periodontitis (P1 and P2)). The accuracy provided by the BIA-AD system ranged from 93 to 98%. The sAA concentration levels achieved for each sample were compared to the values found by spectrophotometry and there was no statistically significant difference between them at a confidence level of 95%. Finally, the method reported herein emerges as a simple, low cost and promising tool for assisting periodontal diseases diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly graphitic nanoporous carbon (NPC) was obtained from an agricultural waste-citrus peel at optimum condition. Then, a low-cost and pore size-controlled magnetic graphitic nanoporous carbon (MNPC) with ultrahigh specific surface area (1064 m(2) g(-1)) was successfully fabricated by coprecipitation of Fe3O4 particles onto NPC. The prepared MNPC was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Raman spectrum, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). BET results showed a significant increase in the micropores volume and specific surface area of MNPCs following the increase of carbonization temperature, which implied that highly efficient carbonization made NPC an excellent active phase for MNPC. Besides, the adsorption mechanism was investigated and turned out that pi-pi interactions between interfering substances and MNPC were considered to be the major driving force for the adsorption process. The experimental parameters affecting the cleanup efficiency was optimized through Response surface methodology (RSM) in detail. Under the optimal cleanup condition, the MNPC was applied for determination of 16 insecticides in vegetables coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), a satisfactory performance was obtained. Good linearity was observed in the investigated concentration range of 1-100 mg kg(-1) with correlation coefficients (r(2)) between 0.9963 and 0.9999. The limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.03-0.33 mg kg(-1). The recoveries ranged from 81.9 to 112.3% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 10.9%. To summary up, the MNPC could potentially be used as a super adsorbent to efficiently remove pigments from vegetables, so that the proposed method was an efficient cleanup and enrichment procedure.

AB A procedure is developed for selective extraction of methylmercury (CH3Hg+) from heavily Hg-contaminated soils and sediments for determination by chemical vapor generation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (CVG-ICP-MS). Soils artificially contaminated with 40 mu g g(-1) inorganic mercury (Hg2+) or methylmercury chloride (CH3HgCl) were agitated by shaking or exposing to ultrasounds in dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) or nitric acid (HNO3) solutions at room temperature. Extractions in HCl (5 or 10% v/v) resulted in substantial leaching of Hg2+ from soils, whereas 5% (v/v) HNO3 provided selectivity for quantitative extraction of CH3Hg+ with minimum Hg2+ leaching. Agitation with ultrasounds in 5% (v/v) HNO3 for about 3 min was sufficient for extraction of all CH3Hg thorn from soils. Coprecipitations with Fe(OH)(3), Bi(OH)(3) and HgS were investigated for removal of residual Hg2+ in soil extracts. Hydroxide precipitations were not effective. Thiourea or L-cysteine added to soil extracts prior to hydroxide precipitation improved precipitation of Hg2+, but also resulted in removal of CH3Hg+. HgS precipitation was made with dilute ammonium sulfide solution, (NH4)(2)S. Adding 30 mu L of 0.35 mol L-1 (NH4)(2)S to soil extracts in 5% (v/v) HNO3 resulted in removal of all residual Hg2+ without impacting CH3Hg+ levels. Vapor generation was carried out by reacting Hg2+-free soil extracts with 1% (m/v) NaBH4. No significant interferences were observed from (NH4)(2)S on the vapor generation from CH3Hg+. The slopes of the calibration curves for CH3HgCl standard solutions in 5% (v/v) HNO3 with and without (NH4)(2)S were similar. Limits of detection (LOD, 3s method) were around 0.08 mu g L-1 for 5% (v/v) HNO3 blanks (n = 10) and 0.10 mg L-1 for 5% (v/v) HNO3+ 0.005 mol L-1 (NH4)(2)S blanks (n = 10). Percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) for five replicate measurements varied between 3.1% and 6.4% at 1.0 CH3HgCl level. The method is validated by analysis of two certified reference materials (CRM); purely Methylmercury sediment (SQC1238, 10.00 +/- 0.291 ng g(-1) CH3Hg+) and Hg-contaminated Estuarine sediment (ERM - CC580, 75 +/- 4 ng g-1 CH3Hg+ and 132 +/- 3 mg g(-1) total Hg). CH3Hg+ values for SQC1238 were between 13.0 and 13.2 ng g(-1), and 79 and 81 ng g(-1) for ERM - CC580. Hg-contaminated soils (57-96 mg g(-1) total Hg) collected from the floodplains of Oak Ridge, TN were analyzed for CH3Hg+ using the procedure by CVG-ICPMS. CH3Hg+ levels ranged from 30 to 51 ng g(-1) and did not correlate with total Hg levels (R-2 = 0.01). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Current imaging techniques, such as position emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and optical imaging, have been developed and applied to imaging acidity in live tissues for years, but they still have some limitations. In the present study, a reliable and interference-free pH imaging method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) was established for the first time. A novel reactive matrix, named glycosyl-3-aminoquinoline (Gly-3AQ), was designed and synthesized here not only to overcome the background interference in the low mass range of MALDI but also provide a new function of acid-responsiveness for the matrix. This matrix was responsive to pH change due to its acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and the hydrolysis product 3-aminoquinoline (3-AQ) has an increase of peak intensity with pH decrease. The Gly-3AQ-based MALDI pH detection method is demonstrated to have good acid-responsiveness in the range of pH 2.0-7.0, and when pH changes 0.5, relative abundance of 3-AQ changes about 1.5 folds. The method showed a very prominent advantage, that is, free-interference when analyzing real samples. Validation for the method revealed pH calibration curve had good linearity (R > 0.9953) with relative standard deviation less than 13.8%. This method was applied to analyze and visualize acidity variation of citrus during development and the changed acidity underwent relative quantitation and statistical analysis. The newly developed reactive matrix has potential application to in-situ MSI of acidity in the biomedical field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New designer drugs, as synthetic cannabinoids (SCs), continuously appear on the market and are booming due to their cannabis-like effect. New generation of smokable SCs, structurally dissimilar from D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), have isomers with distinguishable pharmacokinetic parameters and therefore different in vivo effects. The isoforms are misidentified using conventional techniques such as gas or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry - or tandem mass - spectrometry. The aim of this study was to differentiate three positional isomers (JWH-007, JWH-019 and JWH-122) in single human hair samples, which store numerous substances revealing a way of life and consumption style.
   Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) combined with imaging is an innovative and powerful tool used since few years, especially in forensic research. Herein, we propose an innovative method to monitor the drugs of abuse consumption through direct mapping of the compounds with a high spatial distribution in human hair samples, by state-of-art imaging MALDI-MSn. Three positional SC isomers (JWH-007, JWH-019 and JWH-122) were analysed using high and low fragmentation energy and the resulting MS/MS and even MS3 spectra differentiated the SCs. The MALDI-MS/MS and MS3 imaging was performed on hair soaked in a mixture of the three SCs as well as on hair from self-reported SC user, proving the potential of the technique for a forensic use. Keeping in mind that spatial distribution of organics from whole hair remains a challenge, the described methodology is a very promising analytical tool to probe the consumption of complex drugs and obtain correlation with its origin.

AB An electrochemical aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl (OH-PCB) was developed. In this work, the sulfydryl aptamer selected for OH-PCB was easily immobilized on the surface of the modified glassy carbon electrode via Au-S bond due to incorporation of gold nanoparticles/poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride-graphene composite. The fabrication process of the electrochemical aptasensor was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The peak currents obtained by differential pulse voltammetry decreased with the increasing of OH-PCB concentrations. The current responded approximately logarithmically to the OH-PCB concentration ranging from 2.9-10(-11) M to 2.9-10(-7) M with excellent linear correlation performance. The detection limit of OH-PCB was estimated as low as 5.3-10(-12) M. The developed method had been successfully applied to analyzing lake water. Particularly, the method of the electrochemical aptasensor opens up a new perspective in environmental monitoring by the aptamer identification. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced methods for developing and applying responsive DNA nanodevices are of great interest. Herein, we report a stretchable DNAzyme that allows simple, multiplexed and sensitive fluorescent detection of antibodies. We find that rigid antibody can tightly stretch soft, antigen-labelled DNAzyme strand and disrupt the hybridization between DNAzyme and its substrate. Based on this finding, we develop a novel strategy to detect antibodies. Due to the robustness and high activity of DNAzyme, this assay can easily detect target as low as 1 +/- 0.25 pM and achieve multiplexed detection by using a cocktail of DNAzymes. The proposed assay not only provides a new approach to readily measure antibody, but broadens the application of DNAzyme that is usually employed to detect metal ions or indirectly analyze biomolecules without the cumbersome design.

In this study, we developed a novel whole-cell biosensor for the quantification of phenylalanine and tyrosine through the expression of red and green fluorescent proteins. The proposed system responds specifically and sensitively to phenylalanine/tyrosine without interferences from other amino acids. Furthermore, the precision of the biosensor was evaluated using specimens of normal human urine by LC-MS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of mortality in the world. The detection of HCC in its early stage is the key for early treatment and thus the improvement of the chances of survival. Among the various methods of HCC screening, assays based on the detection of biomarker that is specific to HCC such as alpha-L-fucosidase (AFU) have been regarded as the most prominent methods. In this regards, a new assay for the detection of AFU to screen HCC was developed. This assay was based on the energy transfer between carbon dots (C-dots) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), the concentration of AFU could be monitored by the degree of C-dots fluorescence quenching due to the energy transfer. With this assay, a limit of detection of 3.4 nM (well below the diagnostic cutoff point of 80 nM), and a broad linear range of detection from 11.3 to 200 nM were achieved. We also demonstrate the determination of the concentration of AFU in human blood serum. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Detection methods that do not rely on the amplification of DNA but can reach sensitivity, specificity and throughput of gold standard methods, such as qPCR, have been extensively explored in recent years. Here, we present a hydrophilic-in-hydrophobic (HIH)-microwell array platform that empowers a panel of different amplification-free DNA bioassays: digital enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA), ligation-assisted (LA) digital ELONA and so-called 'analog' bioassays. We developed all three bioassays by using magnetic beads for capturing DNA target, followed by hybridization of enzyme-labelled detection probes and sealing of the built complexes into the femtoliter HIH microwells to achieve the fluorescent readout of single DNA molecules. With the optimized digital ELONA bioassay, we successfully detected 97 and 200 nt-long ssDNA molecules down to 68 and 92 aM, respectively, demonstrating extremely high sensitivity of the bioassay and its flexibility towards targets of different lengths. Importantly, we also proved that the same bioassay concept was suited to detect substantially higher concentrations of ssDNA (up to picomolar levels) by quantifying the total fluorescent intensity rather than counting fluorescent events for digital quantification. Finally, we advanced this concept towards LA digital ELONA capable of differentiating wildtype strands from those carrying single-point mutations even when the former were constituting only 1% of the DNA mixture and were present at 2 fM concentration. In conclusion, the developed platform showed remarkably high sensitivity, specificity and versatility for amplification-free detection of DNA and as such can be valuable for numerous applications in medical diagnostics, gene analysis, food safety and environmental monitoring.

AB In this work, the microextraction devices in form of sachets were prepared and used for isolation of released dental fillings components from artificial saliva solutions As sorbents mesoporous aluminosilicate and C18-bonded silica were used. Gas chromatography was used for indication of analytes in samples. The dependence of adsorption on variable factors were determined. The effect of adsorbent mass, the membrane type for mu-SPE device and time of adsorption on the efficiency of the process were examined. The dependence between the extraction recovery and the desorption solvent was also indicated. Based on calculated adsorption capacities in time of adsorption and equilibrium state the kinetic study was prepared. The validation of determination method by using of membrane-protected microextraction for sample preparation was conducted. The developed method proved to be convenient and offers good reproducibility. The detection limits of the method under optimized conditions were in the range of 0,117 mu gmL(-1) for camphor to 1407 mu gmL(-1) for 4-methoxyphenol. Two examined membrane protected sorbent were successfully applied for extraction of eluted dental ingredients. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Exogenous carbonaceous contaminants coming from sediments significantly bias the radiocarbon date of collagen samples extracted from archaeological bone and teeth. In this study, a new approach combining pyrolysis, comprehensive gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC x GC/MS) was proposed to ensure their removal during the demineralization and bone collagen extraction. This approach permitted to identify hydrocarbon contaminants for archaeological samples from the Neolithic period, in 30-40 mg of collagen. The use of 2D GC improved importantly the separation, selectivity and resolution compared to 1D GC thus permitting to detect organic contaminants within the complex chromatograms issued from collagen pyrolysis. Moreover, efficiency of the extraction steps in collagen sample preparation for radiocarbon dating (acid and alkali treatments, filtration steps) could be evaluated for four different protocols on the basis of organic contaminant removal. Radiocarbon dating of the extracted collagen of four of the tested protocols corroborated the results of the Py GC x GC/MS data. This approach opens new perspectives for the use of comprehensive gas chromatography in the domain of archaeological sciences. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microextractions have become an attractive class of techniques for metabolomics. The most popular technique is solid-phase microextraction that revolutionized the field of modern sample preparation in the early nineties. Ever since this milestone, microextractions have taken on many principles and formats comprising droplets, fibers, membranes, needles, and blades. Sampling devices may be customized to impart exhaustive or equilibrium-based characteristics to the extraction method. Equilibrium-based approaches may rely on additional methods for calibration, such as diffusion-based or on-fiber kinetic calibration to improve bioanalysis. In addition, microextraction-based methods may enable minimally invasive sampling protocols and measure the average free concentration of analytes in heterogeneous multiphasic biological systems. On-fiber derivatization has evidenced new opportunities for targeted and untargeted analysis in metabolomics. All these advantages have highlighted the potential of microextraction techniques for in vivo and on-site sampling and sample preparation, while many opportunities are still available for laboratory protocols. In this review, we outline and discuss some of the most recent applications using microextractions techniques for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-based metabolomics, including potential research opportunities.

AB While there is a large body of research on the properties and detection of traditional military high explosives and propellant low explosives, there is a dearth of research on homemade explosive (HME) materials, though they are prevalent today. The safety of working with these materials in the laboratory is the greatest limiting factor preventing HME research. A vapor delivery tool, the Mixed Vapor Generation Device (MV-Gen), was designed to safely contain the individual solid or liquid components that often compose homemade explosives vapor plumes and deliver the mixed component vapors for instrumental sampling and analysis. Within the MV-Gen, each component is separated and only the vapors mix as they are carried through the device by flowing air. The resulting mixed vapor is representative of either mixed explosive material or bulk explosives. Component materials are held in up to four individual, removable vials with vapor concentrations controlled by vial orifice size, temperature, and diluent airflow. The total concentration can be adjusted by altering vial temperature via a thermal water jacket surrounding the entirety of the device, or by adjusting the flow rate of diluent air through the device. The MV-Gen was evaluated first with surrogate compounds, followed by two types of homemade explosives, to include a binary explosive mixture and a peroxide explosive. To evaluate the device, vapors were cold-trapped on an online sampling system and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was determined that the device yielded reproducible vapor concentrations of both single and mixed components, and the ratio of these vapors can be easily adjusted to mimic varying forms of homemade explosives.

AB Breast milk guarantees all the nutrients required by infants during their first few months of life and remains the most important food source for their health and growth. However, the mother may transfer potentially toxic chemicals to the suckling infant through breastfeeding. The aim of this study was to optimize and validate a fast method for the determination of a total content of 34 elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, Sr, Te, Ti, Tl, U, V, and Zn) in liquid and lyophilized breast milk. The samples were subjected to HNO3:H2O2 (2:1) digestion in an open vessel heated in a water bath (WBD; 80 degrees C) and subsequently analysed by quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry equipped with a collision-reaction interface.
   The performance of the proposed method was evaluated in terms of selectivity, detection and quantification limits, linearity, accuracy, and robustness by using standard reference materials and filed samples of breast milk. Compared to microwave-assisted acid digestion, the proposed open vessel digestion allows a significant reduction in treatment time and sample manipulation, while maintaining a similar analytical performance. Masses of 0.5 g of breast milk were efficiently digested with the WBD treatment allowing a residual carbon content lower than 60 mg L-1 and a residual acidity lower than 0.87 mol L-1 in final digested samples. Thus, it shows great potential for application to routine analysis. The method provides satisfactory detection limits and good performance (trueness and recovery percentages 80-111%; coefficient of variation <10%; and relative repeatability <15%) and allows a high sample throughput for multi-elemental determination in human biomonitoring studies.

AB In this study, we demonstrate a simple and facile method to enable DNA purification and amplification in a continuous step inside a thermoplastic microdevice. The innate property of thermoplastics was adopted to simplify DNA purification because negatively charged DNA can electrostatically interact with the induced positively charged surfaces of thermoplastics as a sample flows inside a microchannel; thus, the DNA purification step can be eliminated. We report the use of natural plastics for the selective adsorption of DNA and conduct a subsequent flow-through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a thermoplastic microdevice. Four thermoplastics-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polycarbonates (PC), polystyrene (PS), and polypropylene (PP)-were selected as analytical models, and DNA adsorption phenomena on their pristine surfaces were examined. DNA was successfully immobilized onto the pristine thermoplastic surfaces, and the results were confirmed by fluorescent measurement and contact angle measurement and by performing PCR using a thermocycler. The electrostatically attached DNA was subsequently released from the pristine thermoplastic surface using a PCR reagent, which contained a low ionic strength salt as a component that could be used for DNA elution. The eluted DNA was then seamlessly amplified in the subsequent microchannel designed to perform flow-through PCR. The PCR products were collected by a microchamber connected at the end of the microchannel for on-site fluorescence detection. The PMMA microdevice was used to successfully purify and amplify a 210 bp target amplicon from a foodborne pathogen, Escherichia coli O157:H7, within 35 min. This study is expected to pave the way for developing an integrated monolithic thermoplastic microdevice suitable for rapidly identifying foodborne pathogens with reduced operation, decreased manufacturing cost, and enhanced device disposability.

AB A simple and sensitive device is presented based on the use of pencil-drawn paper based electrochemical detector placed at the end of a cotton thread fluidic channel in wall-jet configuration. This innovative and fast responding electroanalytical system can be adopted for both single and dual electrode electrochemical detection, this last achieved by applying two different potentials at two independent working electrodes drawn on the opposite faces of the paper based detector. Its performance was preliminarily optimized by adopting hexacyanoferrate(II) as probe species undergoing reversible electrochemical processes. These devices were then used for the single electrode detection of ascorbic acid in aqueous samples and the dual electrode detection of orthodiphenols in extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs). In fact, these devices enable hydrophilic orthodiphenols, typically present in EVOOs (extracted by a 80:20% v/v acetonitrile/water mixture), to be discriminated from hydrophilic monophenols instead present in almost all vegetable oils. Flow-injections runs were conducted by using a 0.01 MH2SO4 + 0.5 KCl running electrolyte allowing the rapid and selective detection of hydrophilic orthodiphenols with satisfactory sensitivity and a low enough detection limit (2 mu M). Different real samples of EVOOs and sunflower oils were analyzed. Abundant enough contents of orthidiphenols were found in EVOO samples, while no trace of these antioxidants was found in sunflower oils. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Foodborne pathogen is the primary cause of foodborne disease outbreak. Given its great damage, a sensitive, simple and rapid detection method is demanded. Herein, we described a self-priming polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/paper hybrid microfluidic chip, termed SPH chip, with mixed-dye-loaded loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for multiplex foodborne pathogens detection. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP) were chosen to verify the novel method. Compared to other similar detection devices, the SPH chip required easier fabrication process, less operation steps and lower cost. Additionally, the reaction result, especially for the weak-positive reaction, could be judged more accurately and conveniently due to the use of mixed-dye. Without pre-enrichment of bacteria in the food contaminated sample, the limit of detection (LOD) reached down to 1000 CFU mL(-1) with high specific. Additionally, for fully exploiting the potential of SPH chip, a conceptual eight-channel detection chip was also developed. Overall, the reliable and excellent result demonstrated that the novel method had great potential to be applied in the wider range of pathogens detection or disease diagnose, especially in some resource-limited area.

AB Abnormal O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) concentrations have been associated with a variety of diseases (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, etc.). However, O-GlcNAc detection is complicated, time-consuming and has poor specificity, therefore, the accurate detection of O-GlcNAc is difficult. In this study, an accurate and sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor for O-GlcNAc detection that is based on beta-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA) and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) was developed. In this strategy, AuNPs were used to amplify the SPR signal and improve the biosensor's sensitivity; OGA was used to cleave O-GlcNAc from O-GlcNAcylated biomolecules. The interaction between AuNPs labeled wheat germ agglutinin (AuNPs/WGA) and O-GlcNAcylated biomolecules on a modified Au film treated with and without OGA was recorded by SPR. The change of the SPR signal moves linearly with the amount of O-GlcNAc on the Au film and thus could be used for the detection of O-GlcNAc. By recording the difference of the SPR signals, this method can avoid disturbances from other sugars and nonspecific adsorption of AuNPs and thus enable the accurate detection of O-GlcNAc. The accurate detection range of O-GlcNAc was 4.65 x 10(-12) to 4.65 x 10(-7) M which was obtained by quantifying the amount of a standard O-GlcNAcylated peptide (O-GlcNAc-CREB), and the detection limit is 4.65 x 10(-13) M. More importantly, the strategy was successfully used to detect O-GlcNAc in a real alpha-crystallin protein, cancer cell lysates and blood samples with satisfactory results. The study's results imply that this accurate and sensitive method has the potential to be applied in the early clinical diagnosis of O-GlcNAc-related diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A strategy to design an immunoassay based on imprinted proteins to detect a foodborne toxin zearalenone (ZEN) has been proposed. Proteins were used as scaffolds for generation of binding cavities with a high specificity against ZEN. Different proteins and different bioimprinting approaches were tested. The imprinted proteins primarily prepared in a tube and then immobilized on a microwell plate, and directly prepared in the microwell plate were compared for an application in immunosorbent detection of ZEN in naturally contaminated wheat and maize samples. The assay was combined with a rapid extraction technique. Specific interactions between the imprinted proteins and the target in a mu g kg(-1) linear range was achieved. As a confirmatory method, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was used. The obtained results allow using the developed immunoassay for the analysis of ZEN with a sensitivity matching the maximum permitted level for ZEN in unprocessed cereals established by the European Commission (100 mu g kg(-1)).

AB Molecular diagnosis of genome is one of the major methods for pathogens detection. The commonly used PCR method can realize an exponential amplification of the target gene but is time-consuming. In this work, we proposed a duplex and visual method using rapid PCR combined with molecular beacons to specifically detect two kinds of shrimp pathogens in one reaction tube. We only need to observe the fluorescence change of the reaction tube with naked eye to determine the result. A home-made automatic transfer equipment allows reaction tubes shuttling quickly between two water baths to achieve rapid PCR amplification. A simple device was also designed to present the detection results easily determined with naked eye. This duplex and visual detection method is fast, low-cost and of high specificity. From DNA extraction to results judgment, only 15 min was enough. Infectious Hypodermal and Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP) are two common shrimp pathogens which were chosen as our detection objects. This method may give a possibility to conduct end-point visual duplex detection, which may make a positive influence on the pathogen prevention. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An integrated multichannel all-fiber optofluidic biosensing platform (M-AOB) has been developed for a sensitive, rapid, and simultaneous detection of up to three trace analytes. The M-AOB platform employs a 1 x 3 fiber optical switch and three single-multimode fiber optic couplers for the transmission of excitation light and fluorescence and one photodiode detector for the simultaneous detection of fluorescence signals of multiple channels based on the time-resolve effect of the fiber optical switch. This design greatly simplified the entire system structure and improved light transmission efficiency. Through an indirect competitive immunoassay mechanism, we detected two highly regulated small molecules, namely, atrazine and 2,4-D, to demonstrate the value of M-AOB to the simultaneous measurement of trace analytes in water samples. The limits of detection of 0.03 mu g/L and 0.04 mu g/L were obtained for atrazine and 2,4-D, respectively, and were highly comparable with those of other analytical techniques. The high sensitivity of M-AOB benefited from the high light collective efficiency and low light loss of the excellent all-fiber optical structures and from the advantages of the evanescent wave technique. The regeneration of the biosensor surface, 200 assay cycles, were performed without any significant activity loss. Each assay cycle was less than 15 min. The immunoassay performance of the M-AOB, evaluated in several spiked water samples, showed good recovery, accuracy, and precision, indicating that the M-AOB was less susceptible to matrix effects of water samples. All these results illustrated that M-AOB can be readily extended toward the simultaneous and rapid detection of other trace small molecules using different biosensors modified by other analyte conjugates and their respective fluorescence-labeled antibodies.

AB Tumor markers have been regularly detected for early cancer diagnosis in clinical oncology. The development of facile and low cost technology has become an important challenge for their diagnosis. We here report a low-cost plasmonic silver needle (PSN) for immunofluorescence detection of tumor biomarkers. The fluorescence signal is enhanced on the needle by up to 220-fold, allowing high-performance detection of tumor markers down to 0.08 ng mL(-1). To assess the clinical potential of the proposed assay technique, PSN-based sandwich immunoassay for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen were performed for blood as well as for serum sample. The results from serum sample have an excellent agreement with an electrochemluminecence assay. The small relative error and a good linear correlation suggest that the accuracy and precision of this analytical technology are satisfactory. This assay technique with lower cost, use of less sample, higher sensitivity and easier procedure shows great promise for the facile and early cancer diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence of phenol in industrial wastewater is an issue of great relevance for petrochemical and energy companies, among others. The high toxicity level of this substance requires polluting industries to continuously monitor the concentration of phenol in their wastewaters so as to comply with environmental regulations and to minimize environmental impact. This research work proposes the experimental development of an analytical method for "in situ" measurement of the concentration of phenol diluted in water, with application in Oil & Gas production wastewater monitoring. The method is based on the principle of selectivity exhibited by the oxidoreductase enzymes in the presence of phenolic compounds. The differences in the performance found when using organic tissues and microorganisms, as natural alternative sources of the enzyme, are also highlighted. These alternative sources of oxidoreductase enzyme work as the recognition element of the biosensor. A dissolved oxygen sensor is used as the transducer of the chemical signal produced by the reaction between the analyte and the enzyme. The bioencapsulation technique is very adequate in this case, because it offers a nutrient medium to the microorganisms and is reusable, making it ideal for repetitive measurement applications. The results show that the biosensor exhibits an approximately linear behavior when measuring phenol concentrations from 0.2 to 2 ppm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the design of new fluorescent sensors, exploration of new materials with excellent properties and smart designs is of continuing interest. Herein, we designed a dual-emission ratiometric fluorescent sensor by doping ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with Cu2+ and Mn2+ ions. The codoped ZnS QDs with two separated dopant emissions were used as ratiometric fluorescent sensors for folic acid (FA). With addition of FA, the Cu dopant emission was quenched while the Mn dopant emission was enhanced. The fluorescence intensity ratios versus the FA concentrations could be fitted to a linear regression equation ranging from 0.01 to 5 mu M (R-2 = 0.995) and the detection limit was calculated to be 6 nM. Thus, this method generated ratiometric fluorescence signals for quantitative detection of FA. To understand the specific fluorescence response of the sensors for FA, the sensing mechanism was proposed based on electron transfer between QDs and FA. Additionally, the sensors were successfully applied to the determination of FA in spiked samples and recoveries were ranged from 95.5 to 102.2%. Therefore, the sensors show high sensitivity and selectivity for FA and the proposed method has good potential for extension to the detection of other biological molecules after further development.

AB A multiplex lateral flow immunoassay sensor based on highly luminescent green-emitting Au nanoclusters (AuNCs-MLFIA sensor) was successfully established for the simultaneous and quantitative determination of clenbuterol (Clen) and ractopamine (RAC) in swine urine. The antigens of Clen and RAC were dispersed on a nitrocellulose membrane as two test lines, and the Au nanoclusters were synthesized from 6-aza-2-thiothymine and L-arginine to obtain highly green luminescence and ultra-small nanoparticles (Arg/ATT/AuNCs). Free carboxyl groups on Arg/ATT/AuNCs enabled conjugation with biomolecules to afford an indicator for the biosensor. The AuNCs-MLFIA sensor is based on the indirect competition assay and could successfully detect samples within 18 min without sample pretreatment, qualitative results can be obtained by visual inspection under a UV lamp. The limits of detection of Clen and RAC by the naked eye were both 0.25 mu g L-1. In addition, the AuNCs-MLFIA sensor allowed quantitative detection combined with a portable fluorescence reader. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of Clen and RAC were 0.06 and 0.32 mu g L-1, respectively, with detection limits of 0.003 and 0.023 mu g L-1. Thirty blind-spiked swine urine samples were analyzed by the AuNCs-MLFIA sensor and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the results of the two methods showed a significant correlation. The newly developed AuNCs-MLFIA sensor overcomes several limitations of conventional LFIA sensors, including their low sensitivity, limitation to quantify analytes, and single-analyte detection.

AB Nutrient pollution is of worldwide environmental and health concerns due to extensive use of nitrogen fertilizers and release of livestock waste, which induces nitrite compounds in aquatic systems. Herein a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor is developed for nitrite detection based on coupling between the plasmonic gold nanostars and the silver nanopyramid array. When nitrite is present in the assay, an azo group is formed between the 1-naphthylamine-functionalized silver nanopyramids and the 4-aminothiophenol-functionalized gold nanostars. This not only generates the SERS spectral fingerprint for selective detection, but also creates "hot spots" at the gap between the Au nanostars and the Ag nanopyramids where the azo group is located, amplifying SERS signals remarkably. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation shows a SERS enhancement factor of 4 x 10(10) at the "hot spots". As a result, the SERS sensor achieves a limit of detection of 0.6 pg/mL toward nitrite in water, and enables nitrite detection in real-world river water samples. In addition, this sensor eliminates the use of any Raman reporter and any expensive molecular recognition probe such as antibody and aptamer. This highly sensitive, selective and inexpensive SERS sensor has unique advantages over colorimetric, electrochemical and fluorescent devices for small molecule detection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We used an electron-transfer carbohydrate-mimetic peptide (YYYYC) to construct an electrochemical cytosensing system. Magnetic beads were modified with either asialofetuin (ASF) or soybean agglutinin (SBA) to evaluate the effect on cell sensing. Because SBA binds to the galactose residue that exists at the terminals of the carbohydrate chains in ASF, the target protein was accumulated on the protein magnetic beads. SBA is an example of N-acetylgalactosamine- and galactose-binding proteins that readily combine with YYYYC. When the peptides and protein-immobilized beads competed for a target protein, the peak current of the peptides changed according to the concentration of the protein at the 10(-12) M level. Next, human myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cell) were measured using the peptide and the carbohydrate chains on the cell surface that recognize SBA. The electrode response was linear to the number of K562 cells and ranged from 1.0 x 10(2) to 5.0 x 10(3) cells mL(-1). In addition, detection of a human liver cancer cell (HepG2 cell) was carried out using interactions with the peptide, the ASF receptors in HepG2 cells, and the carbohydrate chains of ASF. The peak currents were proportional and ranged between 5.0 x 101 and 1.5 x 10(3) cells mL(-1). When the values estimated from an electrochemical process were compared with those obtained by ELISA, the results were within the acceptable range of measurement error. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Azine based new colorimetric sensor 1 for the detection of gasotransmitter H2S has been reported. Sensor 1 used to detect the H2S with a remarkable red shift of 105 nm in the absorption spectra with a colour change from light yellow to brown red. Importantly, rare example of azine derivative has been used as a colorimetric probe for H2S detection using deprotonation mechanism. H2S induced deprotonation of one of the -OH proton followed by a change in resonance of 1 is responsible for the ratiometric spectral and colour change. The detection response was quick and the LOD calculated as 18.2 mu M. Sensor 1 was also explored in the detection of H2S in biological fluids such as human serum and mouse serum. Moreover, for the first time, we have shown the applicability of H2S for the construction of half subtractor molecular logic gate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glutathione (GSH) is of significance in human pathology due to its many cellular functions. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) plays a key role in the balance of GSH by breaking down extracellular GSH. In this study, we proposed a novel strategy for sensitive and selective detection of GSH based on LC sensing platform coupled with its inhibition of gamma-GT. The gamma-GT cleavable surfactant, dodecyl N-ethanamide N, N, N-trimethylammonium bromide (DAA), was synthesized and utilized to decorate the aqueous/LC interface. A black optical image of LCs was observed due to formation of the self-assembled DAA monolayer at the interface. Subsequently, the optical response of LCs returned to bright appearance after transferring gamma-GT to the DAA-laden interface because DAA could be enzymatically hydrolyzed by gamma-GT and the monolayer was disrupted. Interestingly, LCs remained dark images after the DAA-decorated interface in contact with the pre-incubated GSH and gamma-GT. The detection limit of GSH reached 1 pg/mL, which demonstrates high competitiveness with the current assays. The detection mechanism of GSH was explained by Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This work presents an appealing route to achieve ultrasensitive detection of GSH according to its hydrolysis by gamma-GT and the as-prepared simple and robust LC-based sensing platform has potentials in the diagnosis of GSH-related diseases (e.g. cancer, liver damage, and malignant neoplasms).

AB This paper describes a new configuration of the hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane (HFRLM) procedure for the high-throughput determination of the endocrine disrupting compounds 4-nonylphenol, 4-octylphenol, 4-tert-octylphenol, methylparaben, ethylparaben and bisphenol A using a 96-well plate system and high-performance liquid chromatography. In this configuration, cylindrical blades were adapted as a support for polypropylene membranes used as supported liquid membranes in the HFRLM approach. The proposed configuration exhibited important advantages including high-throughput, low solvent and sample consumption, and good analytical performance. The optimized extraction conditions were achieved with the use of a mixture comprised of 50: 50 v/v 1-octanol: hexane as the supported liquid membrane, sample pH 5, extraction solvent 15 mu L (hexane) and extraction time 45 min. The limits of quantification varied from 0.5 mu g L-1 for 4-octylphenol to 15 mg L-1 for methylparaben and ethylparaben and the r(2) ranged from 0.9908 for methylparaben to 0.9992 for 4-tert-octylphenol. HFRLM combined with the use of a 96-well plate provides an environmentally-friendly configuration. It offers good accuracy when applied to analyze water samples, with relative recoveries ranging from 72 to 130%, for 4-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol, respectively, and precision varying from 1 to 14.3%, for 4-nonylphenol at 1.0 mu gL(-1) and bisphenol A at 8.0 mu g L-1, respectively.

AB Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a potential hepatocellular carcinoma serum marker with better sensitivity and specificity. In this study, a highly sensitive electrochemical immunosensor which combines the highly selective proximity ligation assay (PLA) and highly efficient enzyme-powered recycling amplification has been developed for GP73 determination. PLA is triggered by affinity binding of two labelled antibody-DNA (P1-RAb and P2-MAb) to target protein, resulting in increased specificity. The formed immunocomplex hybrids with DNA2 to realize the release of methylene blue labelled mononucleotides fragment with the help of exonuclease III, which acts as the power of recycling amplification. The fragment can diffuse easily to the nafion modified indium tin oxide electrode surface and a strong electrochemical signal can be detected. Under the optimized conditions, the enhanced electrochemical intensity has a linear relationship with the concentration of GP73 in the range of 0.3 pg mL(-1) to 6.0 ng mL(-1) with the detection limit of 0.10 pg mL(-1). The developed immunosensor has been applied to detect the GP73 in the clinical serum samples with satisfactory results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This review focuses on the synthesis and chemical sensing characterization of metal oxide heterostructures reported since 2012. Heterostructures exhibit strong interactions between closely packed interfaces, showing superior performances compared to single structures. Surface effects appear thanks to the magnification of nanostructures' surface leading to an enhancement of surface related properties (the base of chemical sensors working mechanism).
   The combination of different metal oxides to form heterostructures further improves the selectivity and/or other important sensing parameters. A very large number of different morphologies and structures have been proposed, each one exhibiting peculiar sensing properties towards specific chemical compounds. Among the different preparation methodologies, a significant number has been performed by means of hydrothermal method. However, the combination of various fabrication methods seems a very efficient strategy to obtain metal oxide-based heterostructures with different morphologies and dimensions such as core-shell nanostructures, one-dimensional heterostructures, two-dimensional layered heterojunctions, and three-dimensional hierarchical heterostructures.
   Despite all extraordinary advances in both material science and nanotechnology and the results achieved with heterostructured chemical sensors, there are few points that still deserve further studies and investigations, such as possible diffusion across the junctions, reproducibility of the fabrication process, synergistic or catalytic effects among the materials forming the heterostructures and influence/stability of the contacts. Moreover, perfect control over their growth is mandatory for their application in commercial devices. Only a careful understanding of the growth and the interface properties could fill the existing gap between laboratory studies and real-world exploitation of these heterostructures.

AB Iron nanoparticles (NPs) metabolism is directly associated to human health due to their use as anemia treatment and should be studied in detail in cells. Here we present a speciation strategy for the determination of the metabolic products of iron oxide nanoparticles coated by tartaric and adipic acids in enterocytes-like cell models (Caco-2 and HT-29). Such methodology is based on the use of SDS-modified reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as Fe selective detector. Post-column isotope dilution analysis is used as quantification tool by adding Fe-57 as isotopically enriched standard. To assess the separation capability of the method, two different iron nanostructures: iron sucrose nanoparticles-Venofer (R)- used as model suspension and iron tartrate/adipate-modified nanoparticles, both of about 4 nm (core size) were evaluated. The two nanostructures were injected into the system showing good peak profiles and quantitative elution recoveries (> 80%) in both cases. In addition, both nanoparticulate fractions could be based-line separated from ionic iron species, which needed to be complexed with 1 mM citrate to elute from the column. Exposed cells up to 0.5 mM of iron tartrate/adipate-modified nanoparticles were specifically treated to extract the internalized NPs and the extracts examined using the proposed strategy. The obtained results revealed the presence of three different fractions corresponding to nanoparticle aggregates, dispersed nanoparticles and soluble iron respectively in a single chromatographic run. Quantitative experiments (column recoveries ranging from 60 to 80%) revealed the presence of the majority of the Fe in the nanoparticulated form (> 75%) by summing up the dispersed and aggregate particles. Such experiments point out the high uptake and low solubilization rate of the tartrate/adipate NPs making these structures highly suitable as Fe supplements in oral anemia treatments.

AB Based on the flexible molecular engineering technique of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, various polymers carrying positive or negative charges and different terminal groups such as pyrene or tertiary amine were synthesized for fabricating multifunctional solid-state electrochemiluminescent (ECL) sensors. Accordingly, the chemosensors immobilizing the ECL probe or co-immobilizing the ECL probe and the coreactant were realized for the quantification of small molecules (e.g., tripropylamine, tetracycline), and an aptasensor was developed for the specific and sensitive lysozyme assay (limit of detection: 0.1 ng/mL). All of the sensors were realized via a simple odesign exploiting the pi-pi stacking and electrostatic interactions. It was confirmed that the proposed strategy is simple but universal for the fabrication of versatile ECL sensors that showed simplicity, cost-effectiveness, high sensitivity, long-term stability, and excellent reproducibility.

AB In this study, we constructed a new and sensitive ITO based electrochemical immunosensor for detection of interleukin 1 beta(IL-1 beta), a cancer biomarker found in serum and saliva. 6-phosphonohexanoic acid (PHA) was used as a biomolecule immobilization matrix for the first time. Anti-IL-1 beta antibody was utilized as a biorecognition molecule that immobilized onto carboxyl groups of 6-phosphohexanoic acid (PHA) via amide bond. Selective interaction between anti-IL-1 beta antibodies and IL-1 beta antigens was investigated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Single Frequency Impedance (SFI) methods. The surface characterization of the immunosensor was performed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), SEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in order to illustrate individual steps of biosensor construction. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the change in impedance was proportional to IL-1 beta concentrations in the range of 0.025-3 pg/mL (R-2 = 0.99) with detection limit of 7.5 fg/mL. The reproducibility, repeatability, stability, and specificity of the developed immunosensor were analyzed. In addition, the developed immunosensor was successfully utilized for the determination of IL-1 beta in serum and saliva samples by using the standard addition method with recoveries of 96.7-105.4%. This immunosensor was applicable for the requirements of routine analysis with respect to performance, functionality and cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A strategy to determine the elemental composition of organic impurities in commercial preparations was established by combining high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and fraction collector with direct infusion-FT-ICR-MS (DI-FT-ICR-MS). Under HPLC-FT-ICR-MS mode, all impurities in model sample were chromatographically separated and collected by fraction collector according to their retention time. The accurate mass of each impurity and their candidate formulae under 1 ppm mass tolerance were calculated. Subsequently, theoretical isotopic fine structures (IFSs) of the candidate formulae were generated. Furthermore, the collected fractions were tested and the experimental IFSs of impurities were acquired by DI-FT-ICR-MS mode. Finally, the elemental composition of all impurities was decisively determined by comparing the experimental and theoretical IFSs. Our results demonstrate that the combined strategy is effective in separating impurities and acquiring accurate mass by HPLC-FT-ICR-MS, obtaining the appropriate samples by fraction collection technology for DI-FT-ICR-MS, and acquiring the IFSs of impurities by DI-FT-ICR-MS. It could be concluded that the strategy is an accurate and standard independent approach to determine the elemental composition of organic impurities in commercial preparations.

AB High-throughput screening of plastic products in children's living environment is necessary to identify phthalate-containing objects for the concern of public health and safety. A novel strategy of probe collecting technique combined with ambient mass spectrometry was developed to carry out the large-scale sample analysis. Analytes from the surface of approximately 500 objects each in two kindergartens in Taiwan were collected using the same number of the metallic probes. After being delivered to laboratory, the analytes on the probes were analyzed with thermal desorption-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (TD-ESI/MS). As sample pretreatment was unnecessary, the analysis of phthalates on a probe was completed within 30 s enabling high-throughput screening of a large number of objects. All procedure including sampling and TD-ESI/MS analysis together with report writing for a kindergarten was completed in one day. A reasonable relative standard deviation (< 15.6%) was obtained from replicate analyses of phthalate standards. Single-point calibration was used to perform semi-quantitative analysis, and results were validated by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). It was found that 20-40% of the objects in two kindergartens contained greater than low-level (> 2 ng) of phthalates and 40-60% of the objects in the kindergartens contained more than one kind of phthalate.

AB In this paper, we developed a sensitive sensor for phytic acid (PA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection based on glutathione-functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs@GSH). The fluorescence of GQDs@GSH was found to be effectively quenched by Fe3+ ions via photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process. Upon the addition of PA to GQDs@GSH/Fe3+ system, the fluorescence of GQDs@GSH was significantly restored due to the strong chelating and reducing ability of PA, Fe3+ ions could be reduced to Fe2+ ions by PA and formed PA/Fe2+ complex. Therefore, the "off-on" fluorescence method was constructed to detect PA by using GQDs@GSH/Fe3+ as a fluorescent probe. Furthermore, the method can be used for the detection of H2O2. H2O2 can destroy the chelate structure of PA/Fe2+, release Fe2+ ions and oxidize Fe2+ ions to produce Fe3+ ions, leading to the fluorescence quenching of GQDs@GSH again. Under optimal conditions, the fluorescence sensing platform showed good linear relationship between the relative fluorescence intensity I/I-0 and the concentration of PA and H2O2 in the range of 0.05-3 mu mol L-1 and 0.5-10 mu mol L-1, respectively. The detection limits of PA and H2O2 were 14 nmol L-1 and 0.134 mu mol L-1, respectively. Furthermore, the fluorescence assay method was also applied in real sample analysis and satisfactory results were obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two types of silicon-Zinc oxide (ZnO) heterostructures were prepared simply by depositing (drop casting) chemically prepared ZnO nanoparticles onto single crystalline (p-type) silicon substrates (Si) as well as electrochemically prepared p-type porous silicon (PS). ZnO nanoparticles and PS/ZnO structures were characterized structurally by various techniques. By depositing in-plane gold contacts on the heterostructures, gas sensors were fabricated and characterized electrochemically by dc and ac impedance measurements. The PS/ZnO sensors showed specific response at room temperature for NO2 with increase in current and no significant response for other reducing and oxidizing gases. The sensor is sensitive to 200 ppb NO2 at 25 degrees C with 35% change in current and 50 s response time. Temperature dependent studies of sensor in the range of 25-100 degrees C have shown maximum sensitivity at 40 degrees C (50% change for 200 ppb) with decreasing sensitivity thereafter (23% change at 60 degrees C), indicating the suitability of the sensor till 60 degrees C. Alternatively Si/ZnO heterostructures showed maximum response with NO2, along with lesser specific responses for SO2 and NH3. Detailed multifrequency impedance studies with temperature suggested the role of space charge layers at various interfaces in the charge transport properties of PS/ZnO and Si/ZnO heterostructures resulting in their specific gas sensing properties.

AB A simple and homogenous label-free fluorescent method based on target-triggered and enzymatic-assisted isothermal cascade signal amplification was established for nucleic acid detection. This amplification method consists of two circuits that depend on polymerase and nicking endonuclease. In the presence of a target, a hairpin probe was opened to initiate the polymerization and nicking reaction, producing target analogues and G-rich sequences, and releasing the original target DNA. The released target and produced target analogues then trigger a new amplification cycle. Large amounts of G-rich sequences were generated through this cascade amplification process. The fluorogenic dye thioflavin T (ThT) specifically recognized G-rich sequences to form a G-quadruplex/ThT complex, which induced a strong fluorescence intensity. The approach was ultrasensitive for nucleic acid detection, and the detection limit was as low as 5.6 fM. The system discriminates single-nucleotide mutations in DNA and provides a promising strategy for nucleic acid detection in complex biological samples. This simple, label-free and ultrasensitive approach is a promising tool for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Protein biomarkers play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Herein, we report an ultrasensitive magnetic-bioluminescent-nanoliposome based technique using a portable ATP luminometer for the point-of-care testing (POCT) of protein biomarkers in blood. In this study, we use alpha-fetoprotein (AFP, a protein biomarker associated with hepatocellular carcinoma) as a model protein. The bioluminescent nanoliposomes conjugated to magnetic particles (LBM) enabled target protein capture, isolation and detection. In this assay, we use a portable magnetic bead separation pen to simplify the steps. The output RLUs (relative light units) had a linear correlation with AFP concentration between 0.05 and 1000 ng/mL, with a limit of detection of 0.016 ng/mL. Our LBM assay for AFP based on the portable luminometer exhibited high specificity for AFP, with no cross-reactivity with other proteins tested at 25 ng/mL. Forty clinical samples (twenty AFP positive and twenty AFP negative) were tested by the LBM assay, and the results were in good agreement with those determined by electrochemiluminescence, with relative deviations of less than 10%. The successful application of magnetic-bioluminescent-nanoliposomes with a portable ATP luminometer system to detect protein biomarkers in blood has opened a new avenue for biomarker testing. Thus, our LBM assay holds great potential as a POCT assay for use in clinical diagnostics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Exosomal surface glycans play important roles in microvesicle protein sorting and exosome-cell interactions, and also provide promising biomarkers for various diseases. However, in situ detection techniques for exosomal glycans are largely lacking. In this work, an exosomal array is fabricated for probing cancer-related exosomal glycan signatures by lectin recognition-mediated in situ rolling circle assembly of fluorophore-labeled DNA. Different from commonly used lectin array, the proposed strategy enables the direct and amplified conversion of glycan recognition signals to fluorescence detection signals. Focusing on tumor-associated glycans including sialic acids, fucose and truncated O-glycans, the method has been used not only to compare glycan patterns between exosomes with different origins, but also to reveal the specific exosomal glycan characteristics compared to their parent cells. The limits of detection were identified to be 5.4 x 10(6) and 1.3 x 10(6) particles mL(-1) for HeLa and PANC-1 exosomes, respectively. The dynamic ranges were 4.7 x 10(5) to 4.7 x 10(8), 4.7 x 10(8) to 4.7 x 10(9) for HeLa exosomes, and 4.7 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(9), 1.2 x 10(9) to 4.7 x 10(9) particles mL(-1) for PANC-1 exosomes. The remodeling of exosomal glycans can also be monitored as demonstrated on the cleavage of sialic acids under sialidase treatment. It could be anticipated that this strategy would become a powerful tool for development of exosome-based glyco-biomarkers and elucidation of biological significance of exosomal glycans.

AB In this paper, a novel apta-sensing colorimetric platform for rapid detection of chloramphenicol (CAP) in raw milk was developed. The AuNPs are stabilized by short-sequences aptamers against salt induced aggregation and this is the base of most colorimetric aptasensors development. However, the statute shows low sensitivity for the long-sequence aptamers. Herein, we propose an alternative strategy that use intact long-sequence aptamers for develop a highly sensitive AuNP-based colorimetric aptasensor. Determination of CAP in animal derived foods is an urgent demanded in the effort to minimize food safety risk. Therefore, we chose it as the representative model to construct the colorimetric sensing platform based on aptamer terminal-lock (ATL). In the ATL, intact aptamer was used as a molecular recognition element and a short-sequence oligonucleotide serving as a locker probe (LP) which is complementary of aptamer terminal fragments. By formation of aptamer/target complex, the LP leaves the ATL and adsorbs on the surface of AuNPs, leading to the AuNPs stabilization against salt-induced aggregation. This aptasensor shows a low limit of detection (0.03 nM) with high selectivity toward CAP. Moreover, the designed sensing platform was successfully applied to detect CAP in the milk samples. These results demonstrate our introduced label-free method for CAP detection is simple, sensitive, and highly selective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Owing to its dual role as a hormone and neurotransmitter, norepinephrine (NE) detection is of great significance to biomedical diagnosis. In the present work, we have explored intense green fluorescence of poly (norepinephrine) (PNE) nanoparticles synthesized by oxidizing NE in alkaline condition, in combination with red fluorescent bovine serum albumin-stabilized gold nanoclusters (BSA-AuNCs) for naked-eye detection of NE. The effect of sodium hydroxide on the emission behavior of NE was studied. The surface morphology and optical properties of PNE nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Vis, fluorescence, FTIR, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) techniques. For ratiometric sensing of NE, red fluorescent BSA-AuNCs were served as an internal reference while NE delivered a new emission peak at 527 nm, resulting in a wide distinguishable color change from strong red into red, pink, orange, and green under a UV lamp. The ratiometric approach was demonstrated to be highly sensitive and selective for NE detection against even structurally similar bio-molecules with a detection limit of 49 nmol L-1. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied to determine NE in urine samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solid-state nanofluidic pores have been attracting considerable attention of scientific community because of their structural and chemical resemblance with biological ion channels for mimicking biological processes in living systems. Compared to ion channels, synthetic nanopores exhibit high stability, control over pore dimensions (size and geometry) and their surface chemical properties can be tuned on demand. Therefore, they are considered perfect candidates to design and develop nanofluidic sensory devices by introducing a variety of functional moieties on the inner pore surface. Here, we present a nanofluidic pore for the recognition of potassium cations using acyclic polyether derivative in confined environment. To this end, amine terminated acyclic polyether derivative (bis-podand-NH2) is synthesized and covalently coupled with the carboxylic acid groups on the single conical nanopore walls prepared in polymer membrane. The bis-podand moieties fixed on the pore walls in the presence of potassium cation yield recognition domain for the specific binding of K+ cation. Therefore, the changes in rectified ion flux are only noticed on exposure to potassium chloride solution due to formation of positively charged bis-podand-K+ complexes on the pore surface. In contrast, for the case of other alkali metal chloride solutions, only slight changes in the ion current rectification are noticed. We believe that the proposed device provides a strategy to develop and miniaturize different nanofluidic pore based sensors for the efficient detection of other cations/anions by simply changing the length of polyethylene glycol units.

AB Karlodinium is a dinoflagellate responsible for fish-killing events worldwide. In Alfacs Bay (NW Mediterranean Sea), the presence of two Karlodinium species (K. veneficum and K. armiger) with different toxicities has been reported. This work presents a method that combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with an enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA) to identify, discriminate and quantify these two species. The system was characterised using synthetic DNA and genomic DNA, and the specificity was confirmed by cross-reactivity experiments. Calibration curves were constructed using 10-fold dilutions of cultured cells, attaining a limit of detection of around 50,000 cells/L, far below the Karlodinium spp. alert threshold (200,000 cells/L). Finally, the assay was applied to spiked seawater samples, showing an excellent correlation with the spiking levels and light microscopy counts. This approach is more rapid, specific and user-friendly than traditional microscopy techniques, and shows great promise for the surveillance and management of harmful algal blooms.

AB In this study, 63 compounds measured as 10 individual mixtures containing in each case an active pharmaceutical ingredient and its relevant impurities, and additional set of 7 basic beta blockers were analyzed using ultra-high performance supercritical fluid chromatography with UV and mass spectrometry detection. The separations were accomplished using 8 different stationary phases (diol, diethylamine, 2-picolylamine, 1-aminoanthracene, BEH 2-ethylpyridine, BEH, CSH pentafluorophenyl, and HSS C18 SB), 6 modifiers (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, methanol/acetonitrile, methanol/ethanol, ethanol/acetonitrile) and 5 additives in methanol (0.1% formic acid, 10 mmol/L ammonium formate, 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate, 0.4% ammonium hydroxide, and 2% water).
   The resulting chromatograms were evaluated using 6 selected parameters: number of eluted peaks, number of separated peaks, resolution between active pharmaceutical ingredient and following impurity, peak symmetry, peak width at 50% of the peak height, and selectivity. Volatile additives such as ammonium formate, ammonium acetate, and especially ammonium hydroxide provided overall generic approach with very good chromatographic performance. Combined modifier methanol/acetonitrile (1:1) was important for separations of some critical pairs in case of neutral compounds. Diol stationary phase proved its suitability for wide range of applications when the separations of all mixtures were satisfactory on this column, except for vardenafil and beta blockers mixture. HSS C18 SB stationary phase offered unique complementary selectivity especially for analysis of structurally close compounds and/or isomers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wine oxidation changes the chemistry, sensory profile and color of wines. In wine oxidation, phenolics are oxidized to quinones and these reactive compounds can be quenched by sacrificial nucleophiles, such as the A-ring on flavanoids, preventing oxidative damage from the loss of desirable flavor molecules. The "catechol" B-ring on flavanoids, in contrast, can be oxidized by quinones through electron transfer reactions that lead to flavanoid quinones, precursors of browning products. Here we compared the rate of flavanoids reacting by either nucleophilic quinone quenching, or by electron transfer to generate flavanoid quinones. Our approach is based on mathematical modeling of reaction data to derive the rate constants of reactions of A-ring quenching vs B-ring electron transfer with caffeic acid quinone, by fitting the predicted loss of precursors and the appearance of products (or derivatives) with experimental data collected by LC/MS. The rate constant of the electron transfer reaction of caffeic acid quinone towards 4-methyl-catechol was fast (k(4MC) = 3.43E-2 mLmol(-1)sec(-1)) but nucleophilic reactions with afzelechin (k(Afz) = 2.53E-3 mLmol(-1)sec(-1)) or malvidin-3-glucoside (k(Mal) = 5.34E-3 mLmol(-1)sec(-1)), were much slower. No reaction was detected between caffeic acid quinone and isorhamnetin. Additionally, the electron transfer reaction rate of catechin and caffeic acid quinone was much faster at pH 7 (1.22E-02 mLmol(-1)sec(-1)) vs pH 3.5 (1.79E-03 mLmol(-1)sec(-1)). These results help explain why the reaction of catechin and caffeic acid quinone favors the formation of browning products, and more so at higher pH values. Furthermore, bisulfite reacted with quinones faster than the electron transfer reactions, preventing the browning observed in the reaction of catechin with caffeic acid quinone in the absence of bisulfite.

AB It has been reported that isotope fractionation can occur on gas chromatography (GC), yet little is known about concurrent dual-elements isotope fractionations on GC. Revelation of concurrent two-dimensional carbon and chlorine/bromine isotope fractionations of halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) on GC may be of important significance for compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA). This study presents an in-depth investigation of the two-dimensional C and Cl/Br isotope fractionations of HOCs on GC using GC-double focus magnetic-sector high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-DFS-HRMS). The two-dimensional C and Cl/Br isotope fractionations of four organochlorines and four bromobenzenes on GC were simultaneously measured by GC-DFS-HRMS. The isotope fractionations were evaluated with isotope ratios, relative variations of isotope ratios (Delta E-h) and isotope fractionation extents (Lambda E-h). All the HOCs exhibited significant inverse C and Cl/Br isotope fractionations, with Lambda C-13 of 38.14 parts per thousand-307.56 parts per thousand, Lambda Cl-37 of 59.60 parts per thousand-146.85 parts per thousand, and Lambda Br-81 of 25.89 parts per thousand-142.10 parts per thousand. The isotope fractionations were significant in both ends of chromatographic peaks, while the isotope ratios in center retention-time segments were the closest to comprehensive isotope ratios in the whole peaks. Significant correlations between C isotope fractionation and Cl/Br isotope fractionation were observed, indicating that the isotope fractionations might have strong relationships and/or be dominated by similar factors. Relevant mechanisms for the two-dimensional C and Cl/Br isotope fractionations were tentatively proposed on basis of a modified two-film model and the theories related to zero point energy. The results of this study gains new insights into concurrent two-dimensional isotope fractionation behaviors of HOCs during physical processes, and are conducive to CSIA studies involving C, Cl and Br for obtaining high-quality data, particularly to dual-elements CSIA of C and Cl/Br.

AB Here, we introduce a new electrode based on Silver-filled multi-walled carbon nanotube (Ag-MWCNT) and methyltrioctyl ammonium chloride (MTOAC) for highly sensitive voltammetric measurement of Sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The electrode showed an electrocatalytic activity as it led to the diminution of the overpotential and an increase in peak current for SMX oxidation in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0).
   Analysis of surface topography and electrochemical properties of the modified electrode was examined by TEM, EDX and EIS, respectively. Electrochemical performance of the modified electrode was investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques for determination of SMX in aqueous solution. In addition, the oxidation process was found to be dependent on the pH of the buffer solution. Under optimal conditions, a linear relationship between the oxidation current and SMX concentration was found in a range 0.05-70 mu M (R-2 = 0.997) with a detection limit of 0.01 mu M after 2 min of accumulating time. The electrode was successfully used to quantify SMX in pharmaceutical formulations and human urine by DPV. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of sustainable development has impacted in analytical chemistry changing the way of thinking processes and methods. It is important for analytical chemists to consider how sample preparation can integrate the basic concepts of Green Chemistry. In this sense, the replacement of traditional organic solvents is of utmost importance. Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) have come to light as a green alternative. In the last few years, a growing number of contributions have applied these natural solvents proving their efficiency in terms of extraction ability, analyte stabilization capacity and detection compatibility. However, the arising question that has to be answered is: the use of NADES is enough to green an extraction process? This review presents an overview of knowledge regarding sustainability of NADES-based extraction procedures, focused on reported literature within the timeframe spanning from 2011 up to date. The contributions were analyzed from a green perspective in terms of energy, time, sample and solvent consumption. Moreover, we include a critical analysis to clarify whether the use of NADES as extraction media is enough for greening an analytical methodology; strategies to make them even greener are also presented. Finally, recent trends and future perspectives on how NADES-based extraction approaches in combination with computational methodologies can contribute are discussed. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results show the obtained 3D Ni3N/GA composites exhibit excellent electrochemical performance toward glucose oxidation and H2O2 reduction with larger catalytic rate constant K-cat value of 3.75 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) and 1.24 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1), respectively. As a glucose sensor, the obtained electrode provides a wide detection range of 0.1-7645.3 mu M, fast response time within 3 s, high sensitivity of 905.6 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and low detection limit of 0.04 mu M. For detection of H2O2, this prepared sensor offers a wide detection range (5 mu M-75.13 mM), fast response time (within 5 s), sensitivity (101.9 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)) and low detection limit (1.80 mu M). This enzyme-free glucose and H2O2 sensor display satisfactory selectivity, reproducibility and long-term storage stability. Additionally, the sensor can also be used for glucose and H2O2 detection in human blood serum. The results demonstrate that 3D GA nanostructures provide an enviable conductive network for efficient charge transfer and avoid Ni3N nanoparticles aggregation, which is advantageous for electrocatalytic applications.

AB This work reports the proof-of-concept of an ultrasensitive label-free electrochemical aptasensor for Kanamycin (Kana) detection coupling strand-displacement amplification (SDA) with hybridization chain reaction (HCR). In the presence of target Kana, the analyte triggers conformational change of hairpin HP1 (HP1) and two-staged SDA to produce short single-stranded DNA (S1) with the aid of KF polymerase and nicking endonuclease. Meanwhile, the as-produced S1 hybridizes with the immobilized hairpin HP2 (HP2) on the electrode to open the hairpin, thereby resulting in the formation of DNA duplex. Thereafter, DNA duplex is selectively digested by Exo III accompanying S1 recycling. The residual single-stranded probe (S2) on the electrode opens another two hairpins in sequence and propagates a chain reaction of hybridization events between two alternating hairpins (H1 and H2) to form a long nicked double-helix. Upon addition of redox-active methylene blue (MB), numerous indicators are intercalated into the grooves of double-helix DNA polymers, each of which produces an electrochemical signal within the applied potentials. Under optimum conditions, the SDA/HCR-based electrochemical aptasensor exhibits a high sensitivity for detection of Kana down to 36 fM with a linear range from 0.05 to 200 pM. Additionally, the as-prepared aptasensor is successfully employed to determinate the Kana in animal derived food (milk). With the advantages of high sensitivity, label-free strategy and excellent selectivity, the developed aptasensor possesses great potential application value in food-safety analysis field.

AB A novel, simple and sensitive electrochemical method for the determination of ledipasvir (LED), the newly FDA approved Hepatitis C antiviral drug was developed and validated using epsilon-MnO2-modified graphite electrode. Two different MnO2 polymorphs (gamma- and epsilon-MnO2 nanoparticles) were synthesized and characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Surface area measurements show that epsilon-MnO2 NPs have large surface area of 345m(2)/g, which is extremely high if compared to that of gamma-MnO2 NPs (38m(2)/g). In addition, a comprehensive study of the difference in the electrochemical behavior of LED while using pencil graphite electrode (PGE) modified with either gamma- or epsilon-MnO2 NPs is carried out. It was found that surface area and percentage of surface hydroxyls of MnO2 NPs are the key factors governing the sensitivity of the fabricated electrode toward the oxidation of the positively charged LED. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate the morphological shape of MnO2 NPs and the surface of the bare and modified electrodes. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used for the surface analysis of the modified electrodes. Based on the obtained results, epsilon-MnO2/PGE was applied as a selective and sensitive electrode for determination of LED. Under the optimized experimental conditions, epsilon-MnO2/PGE provides a linear response over the concentration range of 0.025-3.60 mu mol L-1 LED with a low limit of detection, which was found to be 5.10 nmol L-1 (4.50 ng mL(-1)) for the 1st peak and 9.20 nmol L-1 (8.10 ng mL(-1)) for the 2nd one. In addition, the oxidation behavior of LED is discussed with a full investigation of the oxidized product using FTIR and LC/MS. The fabricated sensor exhibits a good precision, selectivity and stability and was applied successfully for the determination of LED in its tablets and real rat plasma samples with a good recovery using a simple extraction technique.

AB In the interest of developing novel electrocatalyst for high performance DNA biosensing, with distinctive chiral double helix nanostructure, nitrogen doped chiral carbonaceous nanotube (Chiral-CNT) was employed for ultrasensitive label-free DNA biosensing research. Chiral-CNT can quantitative detection of four DNA bases with high sensitivity and selectivity. Without any prehydrolysis and labeling process, direct electrochemistry of single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA, qualitative and quantitative detection of DNA hybridization (low detection limit: 0.0268 g L-1) were realized. Moreover, sensitive detection of DNA damage induced by fenton reagent was also realized with low detection limit of 0.0350 mg mL(-1) and high sensitivity of 7.42 mu A mg(-1) mL. The high biosensing performance attributes to the unique chiral structure of Chiral-CNT, leads to efficient interreaction between Chiral-CNT and DNA molecule. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work the development of an electrochemical sensor for the determination of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in particular linoleic acid, in commercially available safflower oil as complex matrix is described. The sensor consists of a carbon paste electrode with cobalt(II) phthalocyanine, Co(II) Pc, as mediator and multiwalled carbon-nanotubes (MWCNT) as nanomaterial. As carrier medium a sodium borate buffer (0.1M, pH 9) was used. PUFAs were detected at a working voltage of 0.35-0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The sensor development was carried out in a batch system with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Sensor specification was tested by using various fatty acids (stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid and arachidonic acid) as well as esterified fatty acids, resulting in a specific applicability towards PUFAs, especially linoleic acid (LAH). The optimized sensor was applied in a flow injection analysis system (FIA) for the analysis of PUFAs in complex matrix. Linoleic acid was used as standard substrate to determine the analytical parameters. The linearity ranges between 7.5 and 200 mu g mL(-1) LAH, while the limit of detection was determined to be 2.5 mu g mL(-1) and the limit of quantification is approximately 7.5 mu g mL(-1) LAH. The LAH content was successfully detected in commercially available safflower oil via standard addition method and the results could be confirmed by a reference method. The PUFA content was calculated as LAH-equivalent. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An improved gas sample introduction interface is developed and characterized for gas chromatography coupling and for direct injection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in a pulsed glow discharge (pulsed-GD) ion source coupled to a time of flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) that is typically used for direct solid analysis. The novel interface allows the introduction of the analytes in the flowing afterglow region of the GD (a few mm away from the negative glow region) to reduce plasma quenching effects. Analyte ion signals are acquired in the temporal afterglow region, where low fragmentation of the molecular species is produced, providing useful qualitative and quantitative molecular information (e.g. molecular ion). Analytical capabilities of the pulsed-GD ion source with the novel gas sampling interface provides improved performance compared to previous designs. In particular, limits of detection for the analysis of VOCs in air were below (better) that legally established limits according to Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.

AB Currently, there is lack of standardized conditions for the collection and analysis of e-cigarette (EC) aerosol. Considering the urgent need for the development of these guidelines, a procedure for EC aerosol analysis was developed. A novel automatic e-cigarette aerosol generator was designed. For the first time, melt-blown non-woven fabric was applied for the effective uptake of compounds released from vaporized e-liquid. The extraction procedure was optimized in terms of type of extraction solvent, amount of sorbent and solvent volume. For optimization, a model e-liquid containing flavour additives belonging to various chemicals group with various chemical properties was investigated. The aerosol trapping efficiency was satisfactory and was equal to 92 +/- 7%. Final determination was performed by GC-MS/MS. Quantitation was based on the mass change tracking approach (MCT), which assumes the monitoring of e-liquid mass changes before and after vaping. The combination of non-woven fabric and sampling approach (MCT) was proven to be effective in acquisition of reliable data. Thus, the concentrations in aerosol and emission factors were calculated for aerosols collected during the vaping of both model e-liquids and real samples. Validation was performed by evaluating key analytical parameters, such as linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ). For all investigated compounds, recoveries from 70% to 118% together with precision and reproducibility below 12% were achieved. The applicability of the described approach was examined by analysing EC refill solutions commercially available on the Polish market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Monodispersed red SiO(2)NPs were synthesized in the aqueous solution by modifying amino silane and C.I Reactive Red 136 on unmodified silica nanoparticles. The limit of detection (LOD) of this core-shell red SiO(2)NPs based ICA for E. coli O157: H7 was 4.5 x 10(5) CFU/mL in sterile PBS within 20 min. The LOD of this ICA strip for E. coli O157: H7 in milk and pork samples both were 4.5 x 106 CFU/mL. The core-shell red SiO(2)NPs based ICA for detection of E. coli O157: H7 has no cross activity with other bacteria. All these results show that this new kind of core-shell colored SiO(2)NPs is promising for the practical applications in ICA and other rapid detection fields. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We developed a novel strategy for rapid colorimetric detection of specific DNA sequence based on gold nanoparticles assemblies induced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product. In the presence of target DNA, the two DNA-functionalized AuNP probes selectively hybridized with the prohibited nucleic acid segments of two primers owing to the zipping off of the hairpin structures during PCR process, resulted in the aggregation of AuNPs with a concomitant color change from red to blue-purple. It is a convenient and universal method for sensitive DNA detection with no need for any further post-treatment of the PCR products. Most importantly, our method showed a low limit of detection (LOD) of 4.3 fM with a wide range of target DNA from 16 fM to 1.6 nM. Owing to the versatility and low cost, the proposed strategy could be extremely useful for a wide range of applications, providing a promising tool for rapid disease diagnostics and gene sequencing.

AB We present a novel dual-mode fluorescent and colorimetric immunosensor based on conventional immunoassay platforms by utilizing a gold nanoflower (AuNF)-loaded fluorescein molecule (AuNF@Fluorescein) as signal output. The AuNFs were modified with thiolated carboxyl ligand, which consisted of a hydrophobic alkane chain as hydrophobic wallet for fluorescein encapsulation, a tetra (ethylene glycol) unit for biocompatibility and solubility, and a functional carboxyl group for the conjugation of biorecognition molecules for biosensing. The resultant AuNFs showed a high loading capacity of 3.74 x 10(6) fluorescein molecules per AuNF because of its flower-like shape with many complex branches. By adjusting the solution pH to 8.0, the fluorescein molecules can almost entirely be released from the hydrophobic wallet of AuNF@Fluorescein, which led to strong fluorescent-signal amplification. Under the optimal detection conditions, the proposed immunoassay based on fluorescent signal exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) detection, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 29 fg/mL. This value is approximately 9.3 x 10(3)-fold lower than that of corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-based immunoassay (LOD = 270 pg/mL). The fluorescein molecule also had intrinsic peroxidase-like activity to catalyze 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine oxidation with hydrogen peroxide for colorimetric signal. The proposed method with colorimetric mode further exhibited a sensitivity with a LOD of 17.7 pg/mL, which is about 15-fold lower than that of conventional HRP-based immunoassay. The recoveries of the proposed dual-mode immunoassay for AFP spiked serum samples ranged within 89.85%-100.0%, with the coefficient of variations ranging from 0.5% to 2.4%, indicating acceptable accuracy and precision for AFP quantitative detection. The reliability of the developed dual-mode immunoassay was further compared with a commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay kit by analyzing 20 clinical serum samples, showing that the two methods well agreed with each other, with high correlation coefficients of 0.997 and 0.986 based on recorded fluorescence and colorimetric signals, respectively. In summary, the proposed method was highly suitable for the ultrasensitive analysis of biomarkers or infectious diseases by fluorescence mode and can be used for routine clinical diagnosis by colorimetric mode.

AB Telomerase is considered as a widely accepted cancer biomarker for early cancer diagnostics. Herein, we develop a simple, ultrahigh sensitivity method for detection of telomerase activity, which relied on that RecA-GFP fusion proteins wrapped around telomeric DNA to form fluorescence bouquets. RecA-GFP fusion protein was synthesized through fusion protein technology. In the presence of telomerase, telomerase elongation products are wrapped around by RecA-GFP fusion protein to form big fluorescent bouquets, which resulted in strong fluorescence. This method has the linear range from 50 to 1000 HeLa cells and the detection limit is 8 HeLa cells, based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3. Compared with conventional methods, this method has the advantages of low toxicity, outstanding sensitivity, and excellent selectivity. Hence, it provides a promising approach for the detection of telomerase activity and diagnosis of cancer. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB By coupling a new aptamer proximity recognition-dependent strand translocation strategy with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) signal amplification, we have developed a simple and sensitive method for detecting thrombin in human serums. Simultaneous binding of two engineered aptamer probes to the thrombin target significantly increases the local concentrations of the two probes and facilitates the translocation of a ssDNA strand from one of the probes to the other through toehold mediated strand displacement. Such a strand translocation leads to the generation of a ssDNA tail in the aptamer sequence for subsequent initiation of the assembly of two fluorescently quenched hairpins into many DNA duplexes via CHA. The formation of the DNA duplexes thus results in significant fluorescence recovery for amplified detection of thrombin down to 8.3 pM. The developed method is highly selective to the thrombin target against other interference proteins due to the dual recognition mode, and can be employed to monitor thrombin in human serum samples. With the advantage of simplicity, sensitivity and selectivity, this method can be a universal non-enzymatic and nanomaterial-free amplified sensing platform for detecting different protein molecules.

AB The detection of superoxide anions (O-2(center dot-)) is widely considered as a potential way for cancer diagnosis and the development of enzyme-mimic catalysts is the main challenge in the establishment of electrochemical sensors for O-2(center dot-) sensing in real samples. Here we present a novel enzyme- and metal-free electrochemical catalyst for superoxide (O-2(center dot-)) sensing based on the widely-used carbon nanotubes (CNT). Through a one-step hydrothermal process induced by phytic acid (PA), CNT-based porous foam (PACNTF) was successfully obtained. Characterizations demonstrated the enhanced defect and disorder degree of PACNTF after PA treatment, which leaded to the increased active sites of PACNTF for electron transfer and the adhesion of O-2(center dot-) during the electrochemical process. As a result, the PACNTF presented higher conductivity and larger current response toward O-2(center dot-) sensing when compared with CNT precursor and CNTF without PA treatment. The sensitivity of PACNTF/SPCE was calculated to be 1230 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) in the linear range of 0-193.6 mu M(R-2 = 0.965) and 373 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) in the linear range of 193.6-1153.6 mu M(R-2 = 0.995) with a limit of detection of 0.16 mu M(S/N = 3). Further, the PACNTF/SPCE presented fast response toward cell-released O-2(center dot-) stimulated by Zymosan A. The above results indicated that the fabricated sensor holds potential usage in biological samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Identification of abnormal scars at their early stage has attracted increasing attentions as the scars can only be assessed qualitatively and subjectively upon maturity, when no invasive procedure is involved. This report introduces a fluorescent probe that targets a potential abnormal scar biomarker (connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA) in skin fibroblasts. This probe is constructed of hairpin-structured probes (HPs) targeting CTGF mRNA and the nano-graphene oxide (nano-GO) base. The HPs are non-covalently absorbed on the surface of nano-GO, which pre-quenches the fluorescence of HPs. Close proximity of complementary CTGF mRNA would lead to preferential HP hybridization and dissociation from nano-GO, which restores the fluorescence signal from HPs. Utilizing this probe, we can distinguish abnormal fibroblasts derived from abnormal scars and assess the effectiveness of anti-scarring drugs like Repsox and transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor (TGF-beta RI) siRNA.

Under physiological conditions, the probe exhibits a stable response for Zn2+ from 1 mu M to 120 mu M, with a detection limit of 0.32 mu M in aqueous solutions. The resultant MDPA-GNPs can be used for ultrasensitive SERS detection of Zn2+ because of the strong inter-particle plasmonic coupling generated in the process of Zn2+-triggered MDPA-GNPs self-aggregation, with a low detection limit of 0.28 pM, which is eight order of magnitude lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)-defined limit (76 mu M) in drinkable water. More importantly, the proposed probe can be applied for efficient detection of intracellular Zn2+ with excellent biocompatibility and cellular imaging capability. Therefore, a highly sensitive and selective nanosensor has been demonstrated for both reliable quantitative detection of Zn2+ in aqueous solution and real-time imaging of intracellular Zn2+, suggesting its significant potential utility in bioanalysis and biomedical detection in the future.

AB Determining methylation state of a particular DNA sequence is an essential task in many epigenetic investigations. Here a facile method based on silver nanocluster (AgNCs) fluorescence enhancement is presented. Target sequences were selected from Sept9 promoter region that its hypermethylation is demonstrated as a reliable biomarker of colorectal cancer. Probe DNA was complementary to a 25 nucleotide of the target region and possessed twelve additional cytosines in the middle to grant the formation of AgNCs. After probe strands were hybridized with methylated and non-methylated targets separately, AgNCs were synthesized, and their fluorescence intensities were recorded. Fluorescence intensity enhanced when the target strands were methylated and quenched when they were non-methylated. The Linear range of fluorescence enhancement was from 1.0 x 10(-)7 M to 5.0 x 10(-)7 M with the detection limit of 7.6 x 10(-)8 M. Sensor specificity was checked with non-complementary strands with the maximum similarity of 40%. Further experiments explored various characteristics of methylated and non-methylated DNAs carrying AgNC and indicated that structure of methylated and non-methylated DNAs was affected differently by silver ions that could then influence AgNC fluorescence. This effect was strongly sequence-dependent, and either fluorescence enhancement or quenching was observed with two different sequences. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is of great clinical significance to the diagnosis of various genetic diseases and cancers. In this work, the development of an ultrasensitive ratiometric electrochemical sensor for screening SNP with a significantly enhanced discrimination factor is reported. The ferrocene (Fc) and methylene blue (MB) dual-tagged triple helix complex (THC) probes are self-assembled on the gold electrode to construct the sensing interface. The addition of the mutant p53 gene causes the disassembly of the THC probes with the release of the Fc-tagged sequence and the folding of the MB-labeled sequence into a hairpin structure, causing the change in the current response ratio of MB to Fc for monitoring the mutant p53 gene. Such ratio is dramatically enhanced by the toehold-mediated displacement reaction-assisted target recycling amplification with the presence of an assistance hairpin sequence. With the significant signal amplification and the advantageous specificity of the THC probes, sub-femtomolar detection limit and a highly enhanced SNP discrimination factor for the mutant p53 gene can be obtained. Besides, the proof-of-demonstration application of the sensor for diluted real samples has been verified, offering such sensor new opportunities for monitoring various genetic related diseases.

AB Herein, we report for the first time the isolation of DNA aptamers directed against the whole tau protein, an important Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker. Non-SELEX approach based on the capillary electrophoresis partitioning technique was employed to isolate a high-affinity DNA sequence pool towards the target in only three rounds and one working day. High-throughput sequencing was next performed and the recognition ability of five selected aptamers was preliminary evaluated by surface plasmon resonance using the protein target immobilized on the chip. Finally, the analytical potential of the most affine aptamer was demonstrated through the design of a homogeneous-phase fluorescence anisotropy assay. This DNA aptamer was found to be able to recognize not only the whole tau-441 but also the tau-381, tau-352, tau-383 isoforms. The sensing platform allowed the determination of these four targets with a detection limit of 28 nM, 3.2 nM, 6.3 nM and 22 nM, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A fast and simple supercritical fluid chromatography method for the enantioseparation of twenty newly synthesized orthoconic antiferroelectric liquid crystals is reported for the first time. The effects of alkoxy spacer length and fluorine atom presence and position in the phenyl ring on chromatographic behavior were investigated. Baseline enantioseparation of all compounds was achieved using simple mobile phases consisting of carbon dioxide and alcohol as cosolvent on (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) derivative of amylose as chiral stationary phase. The analysis times ranged from 2 to 4 and from 4 to 7 min for most samples when using methanol and propane-2-ol, respectively. The significant effect of cosolvent type on the enantioseparation of these compounds was assessed and partial complementarity of methanol and propane-2-ol was observed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper reports on a novel ultrasonic injection port designed and constructed to analyze thermally unstable chemical compounds using corona discharge ion mobility spectrometry (CD-IMS). In order to achieve the highest possible efficiency with the device, some parameters such as the solvent type, carrier gas flow rate and sample volume were exhaustively investigated. Through a comparative study conducted, it was revealed that unlike the thermal desorption system, the proposed ultrasonic injection port could easily be used for the analysis of some thermally unstable compounds such as carbaryl, propoxur and vitamin B-1, by means of CD-IMS. To evaluate the potential of the device, carbaryl, extracted from different samples by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction technique, was quantitatively analyzed. The CD-IMS-based results brought forth the detection limit of 0.03 mg L-1, and dynamic range of 0.1-10.0 mg L-1 with the determination coefficient of 0.9981. The relative standard deviations for one day and three consecutive days were 4 and 6%, respectively. Further, the spiked samples of agricultural wastewater, underground water, and tomato analyzed culminated in the recovery values of 83%, 98% and 82%, respectively. The satisfactory results proved an acceptable capability of the sample introduction system, to be conveniently used for routine analysis of thermally unstable compound, without any tedious derivatization.

AB 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an epigenetic DNA modification. Tissue-specific reduction in global 5hmC levels has been associated with various types of cancer. One of the challenges associated with detecting 5hmC levels is its extremely low content, especially in blood. The gold-standard for reliable global 5hmC quantitation is liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) operating in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Difficulties associated with 5hmC detection by LC-MS/MS include its low abundance, low ionization efficiency and possible ion suppression from co-eluted compounds. Hence, detecting 5hmC levels in blood samples for diagnosis of leukemia and other blood malignancies presents a unique challenge. To overcome these difficulties we introduce a simple chemoenzymatic method for specifically tagging 5hmC, resulting in an eight-fold increase in detection sensitivity. We demonstrate that we could quantitatively detect 5hmC levels in various human tissues, including blood samples from healthy individuals and leukemia patients, using the most basic quadru-pole mass-analyzer instrument and only 200 ng of DNA. The limit of detection (LOD) of our technique is 0.001% 5hmC from 300 ng DNA, sufficient for future mass-spectroscopy based diagnostics of diseases associated with low 5hmC levels such as leukemia.

AB In this study, we focus on isolation and fractionation strategies by solid phase extraction (SPE) for a broad range of environmentally related organic acids. These emerging potential contaminants are primary degradation products of spilled petrogenic compounds but little attention has been given to their environmental analysis and risk assessment. Three mixed-mode anion exchange sorbents possessing various backbone polarities were compared with respect to the extraction and fractionation efficiency. Quantitative analysis was obtained using an optimized and validated LC-MS method. We demonstrated the importance of reasonable ion source settings for highest sensitivity of individual carboxylic acids. Furthermore, fractionation of carboxylic acids into aliphatic and aromatic fractions by SPE was achieved by step-wise elution. Best performance regarding the isolation of low-concentration acids (sub mg L-1 level) in complex samples was attributed to Strata XA and is caused by high secondary hydrophobic interactions in addition to the ionic interactions. Isolation and fractionation of acid spiked diesel-spilled harbor water (22 mu g L-1 spike level) revealed recoveries > 80% for all tested carboxylic acids and low carry-overs of neutral petroleum compounds. We conclude that the isolation and fractionation of acidic degradation products by SPE is a powerful tool to investigate this new class of contaminants in relation to identification and ecological risk assessments.

AB A novel kind of macro-mesoporous organosilica monolith, with not only bridged-ethylene groups incorporated into the skeleton but also terminal-vinyl groups protruded from the pore-wall, was prepared so that high-loaded double bonds were achieved. Via highly efficient "thiol-ene" click reaction of such high-loaded double bonds, the surface coverage of C18 groups on monolith could be 5.54 mu mol m(-2), significantly larger than that of the reported separation materials, beneficial to improvement of separation resolution, especially for peptide separation. The separation performance was evaluated using alkylbenzenes and standard peptides. Furthermore, the tryptic digests of complex sample was successfully analyzed. Because of high separation resolution of our prepared hybrid monolith, the peak capacity for 6-h gradient was achieved as 482. Coupling to LTQ Orbitrap Velos Mass Spectrometry, 22523 tryptic peptides from 4423 proteins were identified from the HeLa cells, more than that using the other long-gradient separation by the same system reported, showing great promising of such monolith for large-scale in-depth proteomic analysis.

AB Metabolomics and lipidomics generally targets a huge number of intermediate and end products of cellular metabolism in body fluids, tissues, and cells etc. At present, mass spectrometry (MS) based metabolic or lipid profiling of routine biological specimens including the whole cells, tissues, plasma, serum and urine etc., can cover hundreds of metabolites or lipid species in one analysis, which has qualified deep elucidation of global metabolic and lipid networks. Mitochondria are important intracellular organelles and many critical biochemical reactions occur here, they provide building block for new cells, control redox balance, participate in apoptosis and behave as a signalling platform. Evidence suggests high prevalence of mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in a variety of cancers and other diseases, thus there is an urgent demand for investigating and clarifying mitochondrial metabolic and lipid alterations induced by diseases. Nevertheless, mitochondria contribute a small fraction to cellular contents, profiling of whole cell is probably unsuitable for monitoring alterations in mitochondria. Therefore, metabolomics and lipidomics analyses specially for mitochondria are necessary to understand disturbed metabolic and lipid pathways induced by environment and diseases. However, methods for comprehensively profiling metabolites and lipids in mitochondria have been limited at present. This review summarizes the current states and progress of MS-based mitochondrial metabolomics and lipidomics study. Details of mitochondrial isolation procedure, analytical methods and their applications are described. The challenges and opportunities are also given. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The "dark matter" in metabolomics (unknowns) represents an exciting frontier with significant potential for discovery in relation to biochemistry, yet it also presents one of the largest challenges to overcome. This focussed review takes a close look at the current state-of-the-art and future challenges in tackling the unknowns with specific focus on the human gut microbiome and host-microbe interactions. Metabolomics, like metabolism itself, is a very dynamic discipline, with many workflows and methods under development, both in terms of chemical analysis and post-analysis data processing. Here, we look at developments in the mutli-omic analyses and the use of mass spectrometry to investigate the exchange of metabolites between the host and the microbiome as well as the environment within the microbiome. A case study using HuMiX, a microfluidics-based human-microbial co-culture system that enables the co-culture of human and microbial cells under controlled conditions, is used to highlight opportunities and current limitations. Common definitions, approaches, databases and elucidation techniques from both the environmental and metabolomics fields are covered, with perspectives on how to merge these, as the boundaries blur between the fields. While reflecting on the number of unknowns remaining to be conquered in typical complex samples measured with mass spectrometry (often orders of magnitude above the "knowns"), we provide an outlook on future perspectives and challenges in elucidating the relevant "dark matter".

AB Functional metabolomics is a new concept, which studies the functions of metabolites and related enzymes focused on metabolomics. It overcomes the shortcomings of traditional discovery metabolomics of mainly relying on literatures for biological interpretation. Functional metabolomics has many advantages. Firstly, the functional roles of metabolites and related metabolic enzymes are focused. Secondly, the in vivo and in vitro experiments are conducted to validate the metabolomics findings, therefore, increasing the reliability of metabolomics study and producing the new knowledge. Thirdly, functional metabolomics can be used by biologists to investigate functions of metabolites, and related genes and proteins. In this review, we summarize the analytical, biological and clinical platforms used in functional metabolomics studies. Recent progresses of functional metabolomics in cancer, metabolic diseases and biological phenotyping are reviewed, and future development is also predicted. Because of the tremendous advantages of functional metabolomics, it will have a bright future. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Brassinosteroids (BRs) play crucial roles in a variety of physiological processes in plants. The full elucidation of the functions of RBs relies on sensitive detection and accurate measurement of BRs in plants. However, the identification and quantification of BRs are challenging due to their low abundance as well as poor ionization efficiencies during mass spectrometry-based analysis. Herein, we developed a highly sensitive and selective strategy for profiling potential BRs in plants by stable isotope labeling liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring scan mass spectrometry (SIL-LC-MRM-MS) analysis. In the strategy, we used a pair of stable isotope labeling reagents 4-phenylaminomethyl-benzeneboronic acid (4-PAMBA) and d(5)-4-phenylaminomethyl-benzeneboronic acid (4-PAMBA-d(5)) that can react with C22-C23 cis-diol on BRs for profiling potential BRs in plant tissues. The 4-PAMBA and 4-PAMBA-d(5) labeled BRs could generate two characteristic neutral loss under collision induced dissociation (CID), respectively, which is used to establish the MRM-based detection and screening. The precursor ions of BRs labeled with 4-PAMBA and 4-PAMBA-d(5) were set according to the reported structures of BRs, and the corresponding product ions were predicted by subtracting the lost neutral loss. In this respect, corresponding precursor ions and product ions in MRM transitions are formed. The peak pairs with a fixed mass difference, similar retention times and intensities were assigned as potential BRs. Using the developed SIL-LC-MRM-MS strategy, we successfully found 13 potential BR in different tissues of rape flower. Taken together, the SIL-LC-MRM-MS analytical strategy is promising for profiling potential BRs as well as other compounds that have the same functional moiety from complex biological samples.

AB Misregulation of oxidative and antioxidative processes in the organism - oxidative stress - contributes to the pathogenesis of different diseases, e.g. inflammatory or neurodegenerative diseases. Oxidative stress leads to autoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids giving rise to prostaglandin-like isoprostanes (IsoP) and isofurans (IsoF). On the one hand they could serve as biomarker of oxidative stress and on the other hand may act as lipid mediators, similarly as the enzymatically formed oxylipins. In the present paper we describe the development of an LC-ESI(-)-MS/MS method allowing the parallel quantification of 27 IsoP and 8 IsoF derived from 6 different PUFA (ALA, ARA, EPA, AdA, n6-DPA, DHA) within 12 min. The chromatographic separation was carried out on an RP-C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.8 mu m) yielding narrow peaks with an average width at half maximum of 3.3-4.2 s. Detection was carried out on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in selected reaction monitoring mode allowing the selective detection of regioisomers. The limit of detection ranged between 0.1 and 1 nM allowing in combination with solid phase extraction the detection of IsoP and IsoF at subnanomolar concentrations in biological samples. The method was validated for human plasma showing high accuracy and precision. Application of the approach on the investigation of oxidative stress in cultured cells indicated a distinct pattern of IsoP and IsoF in response to reactive oxygen species which warrants further investigation.
   The described method is not only the most comprehensive approach for the simultaneous quantification of IsoP and IsoF, but it was also integrated in a targeted metabolomics method (Ostermann et al. (2015) Anal Bioanal Chem) allowing the quantification of in total 164 oxylipins formed enzymatically and non-enzymatically within 30.5 min. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autophagy is of great significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Aberrant autophagy has been reported to contribute to the disease aetiology of metabolic syndrome, especially several key lysosomal storage disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms and the correlation between autophagy and lipid metabolism remains unclear. This study was designed and aimed to reveal the alteration of lipid metabolism in response to the autophagy induced by nutrient stress to give new insights into the molecular mechanisms between autophagy and lipid metabolism. An online normal-phase/reversed-phase two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (NP/RP 2D LC-MS) method was developed to perform the lipidomics analysis of Atg7(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) and wild-type MEFs under nutrient stress. 48 and 35 lipid species in wild-type and Atg7(-/-) MEFs respectively finally meet the screening criteria with p-value less than 0.05 and fold change more than 1.5 in response to nutrient stress. Their alterations indicated that autophagy participated lipid metabolism to generate energy and form autophagosomes with significantly increased free fatty acids and glycerophospholipids, which protected wild-type MEFs from serious damages and delayed cell death. However, in Atg7(-/-) MEFs, due to the inhibition of autophagy, lipids were continuously consumed and cells suffered from damages even death. These results illustrated the close relationship between autophagy and lipid metabolism comprehensively and revealed diverse lipid targets for the investigation of autophagy. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although numerous studies have raised public concerns regarding the safety of anesthetics including sevoflurane in children, the biochemical mechanisms leading to anesthetics-induced neurotoxicity remain elusive. Moreover, potential biomarker(s) for early detection of general anesthetics-induced brain injury are urgent for public health. We employed an enabling technology of shotgun lipidomics and analyzed nearly 20 classes and subclasses of lipids present in the blood serum of postnatal day (PND) 5 or 6 rhesus monkeys temporally collected after exposure to sevoflurane at a clinically relevant concentration or room-air as control. Lipidomics analysis revealed numerous significant anesthetic-induced changes of serum lipids and their metabolites as well as short chain acylcarnitines in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid after anesthetic exposure. These include decreased carnitine and acylcarnitines, unchanged triacylglycerol mass but accumulation of 16:0 and 18:1 fatty acyl chains in the triacylglycerol pool, losses of polyunsaturated fatty acids in both non-esterified fatty acid and phospholipid pools, and increased 4-hydroxynonenal content as early as 2 h after sevoflurane exposure. Importantly, the amounts of short chain acylcarnitines in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid were also significantly reduced after anesthetic exposure. We propose that this serum lipidomic profile can serve as indicative of neuronal damage. Our results reveal that sevoflurane exposure induces an energy deficient state in the evidenced by reduced free and acyl carnitine contents, as well as the presence of a pro-inflammatory state in the exposed animals, providing deep insights into the underlying mechanisms responsible for anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.

AB Chemical isotope labeling (CIL) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has a potential to become a very powerful platform for comprehensive and quantitative analysis of metabolites in cellular metabolomics. While CIL LC-MS with rationally designed reagents for labeling can provide much enhanced detection and quantification of metabolites, pre-analytical process such as cell harvest and cell lysis is also a critical step in the overall workflow for metabolomic analysis. In this study, we examined various combinations of cell harvest and cell lysis methods in order to develop a simple and efficient method for harvesting and lysing adherent mammalian cells tailored to CIL LC-MS-based cellular metabolomics. We evaluated and compared two cell harvest methods (physical scraping and trypsinization) and two cell lysis methods (glass-bead-assisted lysis and freeze-thaw-cycle lysis). We used two types of commonly used mammalian cells, HeLa and MCF-7 cells, to cross-validate the findings. LC-UV quantification of the labeled metabolites after dansylation of cell extracts was used to compare the overall cell harvest and cell lysis efficiencies among different combination methods. It was found that scraping combined with freeze-thaw-cycle lysis gave the highest total metabolite concentration. We also performed multivariate and univariate analyses of the amine/phenol submetabolome data generated from different preparations to investigate the impact of cell harvest and lysis methods on cellular metabolome profiles. Comparing to scraping, trypsinization caused more significant metabolome changes likely due to metabolite leakage and metabolite level changes. The cellular metabolomes obtained from the two lysis methods were found to be similar; however, freeze-thaw-cycle lysis gave a higher lysis efficacy, compared to the glass bead method. We concluded that the combination of scraping and freeze-thaw-cycle was optimal for harvesting and lysing adherent mammalian cells for CIL LC-MS metabolomics. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic helminth that infects millions of people mostly in tropical parts of the world. Different life cycle stages of S. mansoni, that infect or develop in the human host, promote distinct immune responses and are known for their ability to modulate host immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms through which the parasites interact with, and modulate the host immune system remain incompletely understood. Despite the well-known ability of various lipids to modulate immune responses, a comprehensive analysis of the lipidome of the different life cycle stages has not been performed. Using three complementary MS-based platforms to detect and quantify around 350 lipid species, we here characterized the lipid profiles of S. mansoni cercariae, worms and eggs, as well as extracts and excretory/secretory (ES) products of different life cycle stages of S. mansoni. We identified life cycle stage specific signatures of lipid classes of which cercariae were found to have the most distinct profile. Moreover, we detected several immunolomodulatory oxylipids in the different life cycle stages. Specifically, prostaglandins were found to be most highly enriched in egg preparations, while resolvins were specifically detected in cercariae. Together, the generation of this detailed lipid database of the different life cycle stages of S. mansoni will not only be important for a better understanding of the biology of the parasite itself but also of host-parasite interactions and how that could result in immunomodulation.

AB The acquisition of high-quality quantitative dataset is the prerequisite for large-scale targeted metabolomics. However, the goal is usually dampened by the complexity of the biological matrices in terms of structural diversity, concentration span, and polarity range. We attempted herein to propose an analytical approach being able to circumvent these technical obstacles, and medicinal bile was employed as a proof of concept. In the liquid chromatography (LC)domain, reversed phase LC and hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography were coupled in series, namely RPLC-HILIC, to yield appropriate chromatographic behavior for each component regardless of the polarity. In-depth chemical characterization and widely quantitative analysis were successively conducted in the mass spectrometry (MS) domain. Hybrid ion trap-time of flight MS was jointly deployed with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap MS for metabolite searching because of their orthogonal natures. Afterwards, a tailored MRM strategy that integrated online parameter optimization, ion intensity tailoring, and scheduled monitoring, was subsequently constructed to accomplish comprehensive quantitation although authentic compounds weren't involved and concentration span was quite large. Calibration curve was constructed for each detected identity by preparing and serially diluting the universal metabolome standard (UMS) solution that merged chemical information from all bile samples. Quasi-contents of 164 components including bile acids, sterols, eicosanoids, amino acids, lipids, flavonoids, and so forth, were gained by applying those regressive calibration curves and replaced the role of peak areas to serve as the variables for multivariate statistical analysis. In particular, the concentration ratio between tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA) that were exactly co-eluted as a single peak was calculated from the intensity specific value of m/z 498 > 80 over 498 > 124. Different metabolome occurred among various animal bile samples, and significant variations were also observed for different batches of bear bile powders. Bile acids acted as the indicative components in either discrimination. Overall, RPLC-HILICetailored MRM enabled quantitative metabolome profiling of medicinal bile and was thereby a promising analytical tool for large-scale targeted metabolomics. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, which correlated with high mortality worldwide. Exercise is one of the effective lifestyle interventions in maintaining blood glucose level in the normal range and lowering risk factors. Metabolomics approaches are powerful tools in systematic study of overall metabolic changes in response to disease or interventions. In this study, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics studies were performed to investigate the regulatory effect of moderate intensity of exercise on db/db diabetic mice in skeletal muscle. Both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been carried out to monitor a wide range of regulated metabolites. Ninety-five metabolites were identified which contributing to the discrimination of db/m thorn control and db/db diabetic mice. The regulatory effects of exercise on these metabolites were mainly focusing on attenuating the levels of long-chain fatty acids (C14 to C18) and medium-to long-chain acylcarnitines (C12 to C18), indicated that exercise might play a positive role in inhibiting the accumulation of excessive lipids, which is positively related to insulin resistance. In addition, uric acid, which is a risk factor for inflammation, cardiovascular complications, and fatty liver in diabetic patients, together with its intermediates (such as inosinic acid, hypoxanthine, etc.) in purine metabolism pathway, were also substantially down regulated after exercise, indicating exercise might also be protective against hyperuricemia related risks in T2DM. These findings reveal that moderate intensity of exercise might play a positive role in improving the efficiency of lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle and meanwhile enhancing uric acid clearance to prevent lipid accumulation, which might contribute to improved body fitness and body muscle composition.

AB Rosemary diterpenes have demonstrated diverse biological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, as well as other beneficial effects against neurological and metabolic disorders. In particular, carnosic acid (CA), carnosol (CS) and rosmanol (RS) diterpenes have shown interesting results on anticancer activity. However, little is known about the toxic effects of rosemary diterpenes at the concentrations needed to exert their antiproliferative effect on cancer cells. In our study, CA, CS and RS exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on cell viability of two human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29 and HCT116) after 24 h exposure. HT-29 cell line was more resistant to the inhibitory effect of the three diterpenes than HCT116 cell line. Among the three diterpenes, RS exerted the strongest effect in both cell lines. To investigate the hepatotoxicity of CA, CS and RS, undifferentiated and differentiated HepaRG cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of the diterpenes (from 10 to 100 mu M). Differentiated cells were found to be more resistant to the toxic activity of the three diterpenes than undifferentiated HepaRG, probably related to a higher detoxifying function of differentiated HepaRG cells compared with the undifferentiated cells. The metabolic profiles of differentiated HepaRG cells in response to CA, CS and RS were examined to determine biochemical alterations and deepen the study of the effects of rosemary phenolic diterpenes at molecular level. A multiplatform metabolomics study based on liquid- and gas-chromatography hyphenated to high resolution mass spectrometry revealed that rosemary diterpenes exerted different effects when HepaRG cells were treated with the same concentration of each diterpene. RS revealed a greater metabolome alteration followed by CS and CA, in agreement with their observed cytotoxicity. Metabolomics provided valuable information about early events in the metabolic profiles after the treatment with the investigated diterpenes from rosemary. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Development of rapid metabolomic methods poised for pathway discovery is expected to facilitate the identification of therapeutic candidates in the metabolomic approach to translational medicine. Using sphingolipid homeostasis as a prototype, we present herein an integrated method to facilitate a fast interrogation of altered sphingolipid (and phospholipid) metabolism associated with perturbed endo-lysosomal functions in mammalian systems. Constructed upon high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, this method allows semi-quantitative measurements of more than 300 individual species within 20 min. The method was applied to investigate cardiac- and neural-specific developmental changes in sphingolipid regulation from the postnatal stage to reproductive senescence in mice, revealing that endogenous lysobisphosphatidic acids and specific complex glyco-sphingolipids are tightly co-regulated to foster concerted reductions in sphingolipid levels at distinct stages of postnatal development. Our lipidomic data suggest that such changing regulatory patterns in sphingolipid homeostasis is attributed to differential endolysosomal degradation of complex sphingo-lipids, which may be critical in ensuring efficient sphingolipid catabolism and organismal health at each stage of postnatal development.

AB A robust, sensitive, high-throughput method for the detection and quantification of catecholamines in serum, including dopamine, 5-methoxytryptamine, tyramine, phenylethylamine (PEA), epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), metanephrine (MN), and normetanephrine (NMN) is described. It is based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a positive scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Key to the success of the method is the inclusion of an amine derivatization step, using phenylisothiocyanate (PITC), prior to liquid chromatographic separation of the targeted analytes on a C18 reversed-phase column. Mass spectrometric conditions, e.g., characteristic fragmentations and quantification transitions were also optimized to obtain maximum sensitivity and specificity. The limits of detection for all the target analytes are in the low nanomolar range. The recovery rates of spiked serum samples with three different concentration levels, i.e., low, medium, and high, are in the range of 93.2%-113% with satisfactory precision values of less than 10.9%. This method was successfully applied to determine the concentrations of dopamine, 5-methoxytryptamine, tyramine, PEA, EPI, NE, MN, and NMN in multiple human serum samples, with results matching closely those reported in the literature. Comparisons to other reported methods for measuring catecholamines indicates this new approach requires 10-20X less volume, making it ideal for targeted metabolomics studies with volume-limited samples. The method has been adapted to a 96-well plate format and has allowed the quantitative determination of catecholamines in more than 800 serum samples on a single instrument in just nine days.

AB We characterized the performance of a micro-flow LC-ESI-MS2 approach to analyze lipid mediators (LMs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that was optimized for SPE free lipid extraction. Tandem mass spectrometry was exclusively performed in parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode using TOF and Orbitrap analyzers. This acquisition strategy allowed in addition to quantitation by specific quantifier ions to perform spectrum comparisons using full MS2 spectra information of the analyte. Consequently, we developed a dedicated software SpeCS that allows to 1) process raw peak lists, 2) generate customized spectral libraries, 3) test specificity of quantifier ions and 4) perform spectrum comparisons. The dedicated scoring algorithm is based on signal matching and Spearman's rank correlation of intensities of matched signal. The algorithm was evaluated in respect of its specificity to distinguish structural related LMs on both instrument platforms. We show how high resolution mass spectrometry is beneficial to distinguish co-eluted LM isomers and provide a generalized quality control procedure for PRM. The applicability of the approach was evaluated analyzing the lipid mediator response during M. tuberculosis infection in the mouse lung. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carnitines are diagnostic biomarkers of fatty acid oxidation defects and organic acidemias. Quantitative measurements of various carnitines in dried blood spot (DBS) have potential use in remote health applications for disease diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance. To provide an improved LC/multiplereaction monitoring (MRM)-MS method for quantitation of carnitines in DBS, 3-nitrophenylhydrazine (3NPH) was tested as a high-efficiency chemical isotope-labeling reagent for pre-analytical derivatization of 24 routinely-analyzed species. Reaction conditions were optimized and carnitine structural isomers were separated by reversed-phase LC with positive-ion MRM/MS detection, giving on-column lower LOQs of sub-to low-femtomole levels. C-13(6)-3NPH was used to produce C-13(6)- or C-13(12)-labeled derivatives of the mono- and di-carboxylic carnitines in a "one-pot" reaction. These labeled analogues were used as stable isotope-labeled internal standards to compensate for possible ESI matrix effects. Combined with an optimized, two-step procedure for the extraction of carnitines from DBS, this isotope-labeling derivatizaiton - LC/MRM-MS method provided good linearity, high precision (intra-day CVs of <= 7.8% and inter-day CVs of <= 8.8%) and high accuracy (three levels of standard substances spiked in, with recoveries of 86.9%-109.7%) quantitation of carnitines in three sets of DBSs on cellulose or cotton filter paper. This method was then applied to determine the concentration changes of the analytes in the DBSs under two stability-testing regimes: 1) a one-time 4-h sunlight exposure and 2) a set of cycled temperature transitions (-20 degrees C for 2 days, 40 degrees C for 2 days, and back to -20 degrees C for 2 additional days). All of the carnitines showed good stabilities under the first testing condition. Under the second testing condition, free carnitine showed concentration increases of 9.3% -16.1%; acetyl carnitine, 3-OH butyryl carnitine, and malonyl carnitine showed concentration decreases of 12.2%-17.3%, 12.9%-17.1% and 10.7%-15.3%, respectively, and other 20 acyl carnitines showed concentration changes of <10% in three sets of DBSs on cellulose or cotton filter paper. These preliminary stability-testing results indicate a need to more systematically investigate the effects of various environmental conditions on the chemical stabilities of carnitines in DBS specimens if this sampling method is to be used in remote health applications.

AB Bladder cancer constitutes the ninth most common cancer worldwide and, despite continuous development of new diagnostic approaches, the thirteenth leading cause of global cancer mortality. In our previous untargeted urine metabolomic investigation, seventeen metabolites were found to be statistically differentiating bladder cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to develop and validate an analytical method for simultaneous quantitative determination of those metabolites using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry technique (RP-HPLC-QQQ/MS). Different chromatographic conditions, as well as various sample treatment procedures were tested in order to provide the best separation and the lowest limit of quantification (LOQ) values for studied compounds. The validation was performed according to the Food and Drug Administration guidelines (FDA). The limit of determination (LOD) and the LOQ values were in the range of 0.21-10.51 ng/ml and 0.69-35.02 ng/ml, respectively. The concentration range of compounds was developed between 2.5 and 12500 ng/ml. Only one compound (trimethyllysine) showed a significant matrix effect (61%) and consequently low process efficiency (64%). Overall, developed method presented recovery and precision values within the ranges proposed by FDA guidelines. The optimized and validated method was applied to urine samples obtained from 40 patients with bladder cancer and 40 healthy volunteers matched according to ones of the most important risk factors for developing urinary bladder tumors, e.i. age, gender and BMI. Afterwards, statistical analysis was provided by the use of Student's t-test or U-Mann Whitney test. The developed method was sensitive, selective and reproducible to be applied for the quantification of metabolites in the investigation of urine samples. As a consequence, ten out of previously chosen seventeen compounds, participating in different metabolites' pathways (gut floral metabolism, RNA degradation, purine metabolism, etc.), were found to be statistically significantly different in the urine concentration (p < 0.05) between cancer and control groups.

AB Tryptophan (TRP) and its catabolites have attracted a lot of attention because of their clinical significance to human health. Recently, microbiome-gut-brain axis was found to have links to many diseases based on the imbalance of TRP catabolism. By using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, we present a rapid, robust and comprehensive method to determine 31 TRP catabolites covering three major pathways - kynurenic, serotonergic and bacterial degradation - within 5 min. Polarity switching was employed to analyze catabolites in both ionization modes simultaneously for greatly improved analytical throughput. The intra-day and inter-day precision were 0.5-15.8% and 1.5-16.7%, respectively. Accuracy was between 75.8 and 126.9%. The developed method was applied to study the tissue level of TRP catabolites in the liver, ileum, ileal contents, brain and plasma samples from 8 mice, and clear differences in the distribution of TRP catabolites were observed in different tissues. Ratios of key catabolites to TRP were used to evaluate the activities of specific enzyme and pathway in respective tissues. This method has potential in high throughput analysis of TRP catabolites in biological matrices, which can facilitate understanding the influence of TRP catabolites on microbiome-gut-brain axis and on human health.

AB Large amounts of data are generally produced from mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) experiments in obtaining the molecular and spatial information of biological samples. Traditionally, MS images are constructed using manually selected ions, and it is very challenging to comprehensively analyze MSI results due to their large data sizes and highly complex data structures. To overcome these barriers, it is obligatory to develop advanced data analysis approaches to handle the increasingly large MSI data. In the current study, we focused on the method development of using Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches. We aimed to effectively extract the essential information present in the large and complex MSI data and enhance the metabolomic data analysis of biological tissues. Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm was used to obtain major patterns of spatial distribution and grouped metabolites with the same spatial distribution patterns. In addition, both supervised and unsupervised ML methods were established to analyze the MSI data. In the supervised ML approach, Random Forest method was selected, and the model was trained using the selected datasets based on the distribution pattern obtained from MCR-ALS analyses. In the unsupervised ML approach, both DBSCAN (Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) were applied to cluster the MSI datasets. It is worth noting that similar patterns of spatial distribution were discovered through MSI data analysis using MCR-ALS, supervised ML, and unsupervised ML. Our protocols of data analysis can be applied to process the data acquired using many other types of MSI techniques, and to extract the overall features present in MSI results that are intractable using traditional data analysis approaches.

AB An intuitive and practical way to control chemical equivalence of secondary metabolites in herbal materials based on chromatographic fingerprints deserves a thorough discussion, yet it is relatively unexplored. For the first time, we propose a mixture of three similarity indices, the congruence coefficient, the average of the peak area ratios, and the larger value between the maximum peak area ratio and the reciprocal of the minimum peak area ratio, to make up for the weak points of some widely used similarity indices and to evaluate the chemical equivalence of two fingerprints from various perspectives. The three similarity values are fed into a three-dimensional kernel density estimation to determine the quality of herbal materials. This estimation enables precise detection of anomalies in the absence of prior quality determination experience. Forty Atractylodes samples similar in appearance and indiscriminately used for medical purposes were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach. After a reference sample was postulated, a quality assessment of the 40 samples was performed using the three similarity values and the estimated kernel density. The samples that were judged by the developed approach to be of good quality were compared with those chosen by the most popular approach using decision criterion of a single similarity index. The benefits of the proposed approach were evident in that the qualified samples had the composition ratio and individual concentrations of multi-components closer to those of the reference in general, and their inter-sample deviation was significantly smaller.

AB Deep neural network (DNN) is a useful machine learning approach, although its applicability to metabolomics studies has rarely been explored. Here we describe the development of an ensemble DNN (EDNN) algorithm and its applicability to metabolomics studies. As a model case, the developed EDNN approach was applied to metabolomics data of various fish species collected from Japan coastal and estuarine environments for evaluation of a regression performance compared with conventional DNN, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms. This study also revealed that the metabolic profiles of fish muscles were correlated with fish size (growth) in a species-dependent manner. The performance of EDNN regression for fish size based on metabolic profiles was superior to that of DNN, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms. The EDNN approach, therefore, should be helpful for analyses of regression and concerns pertaining to classification in metabolomics studies. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Absolute metabolite concentrations are essential information for quantitative metabolomics studies, as concentrations are closely related to metabolic reactions, enzyme kinetics and other important biological activities. A well-performed metabolites extraction procedure, a reliable detection method, and a robust quantitative approach are all critical factors for obtaining absolute metabolite concentrations. Here, we used a HPLC-MS/MS based platform to successfully develop a C-13-labeled quantitative metabolomics approach, and applied this novel method to quantify bacterial metabolite concentrations in three different domains (i.e., intracellularly, extracellularly and to the whole culture), with high accuracy for a model Escherichia coli bacteria. The bacterial culture was grown in universal C-13-labeled medium and the metabolites were extracted by 40/40/20/methanol/ACN/H2O with 0.1% formic acid. One hundred and twenty-five metabolites were initially screened and one hundred and six C-13 metabolites were confidently detected from the model bacteria grown in C-13-labeled medium. A subset of twenty-one metabolites was subsequently quantified using C-12-metabolite chemical standards to assist the calculation of C-13 metabolite concentration. This rigorous C-13-labled quantitative method was then applied to characterize the metabolic profile changes in three domains of E. coli going through antibiotic treatment. Our results demonstrated that metabolites from all three domains can be used to significantly differentiate the ampicillin treatment group and control group (without ampicillin). In conclusion, our work demonstrated that the quantitative metabolomics approach can be used as a valuable tool to study bacterial metabolism in different domains and to understand their response to environmental perturbations.

AB A liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS) assay was developed and qualified for analyzing 35 analytes of the cholesterol metabolism, including free cholesterol, 17 free, non-esterified oxysterols and 17 free and conjugated bile acids in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. As internal standards, 25 commercially available stable deuterium-labeled analogs of the analytes were used. Pre-analytical investigations included stability tests of analyte concentrations affected by different anticoagulation additives: lithium heparin-, citrate-, EDTA-K-3-stabilized plasma and serum, and the stability in EDTA whole blood at RT. This LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS method was successfully applied for the analysis of paired serum/cerebrospinal fluid samples of patients with and without blood-brain barrier disturbance, as well as of 100 plasma samples of a LIFE-Adult study sub-cohort.
   A fast and simple sample preparation including protein precipitation and on-line solid-phase extraction was developed. As little as 55 mu L of human plasma/serum or cerebrospinal fluid were needed for the analysis. It was possible to separate isomeric oxysterols and bile acids within 23 min using a C18 core-shell column. The assay is capable of quantifying in a linear range of 0.8-250 ng mL(-1) for free hydroxycholesterols, 0.2-10 ng mL(-1) for dihydroxycholesterols, 0.2-500 ngmL(-1) for bile acids and 16 -2000 mu g mL(-1) for cholesterol with acceptable accuracy and precision.
   In cerebrospinal fluid one free oxysterols, five free and five conjugated bile acids could be quantified. No significant differences between patients with and without blood-brain barrier disturbance were obtained.
   In the LIFE-Adult sub-cohort two free oxysterols, four free and seven conjugated bile acids could be quantified in EDTA plasma. Men showed significantly higher concentrations of 26-OHC than women (p = 0.035). Furthermore, in women lower levels of cholic acid, glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, glycolithocholic acid and higher levels of taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid/hyodeoxycholic acid were quantified.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Patients with early stage lung cancer have the best prognosis with surgical removal of the tumor, but the disease is often asymptomatic until advanced disease develops, and there are no effective blood-based screening methods for early detection of lung cancer in at-risk populations. We have explored the lipid profiles of blood plasma exosomes using ultra high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (UHR-FTMS) for early detection of the prevalent non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Exosomes are nanovehicles released by various cells and tumor tissues to elicit important biofunctions such as immune modulation and tumor development. Plasma exosomal lipid profiles were acquired from 39 normal and 91 NSCLC subjects (44 early stage and 47 late stage). We have applied two multivariate statistical methods, Random Forest (RF) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to classify the data. For the RF method, the Gini importance of the assigned lipids was calculated to select 16 lipids with top importance. Using the LASSO method, 7 features were selected based on a grouped LASSO penalty. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for early and late stage cancer versus normal subjects using the selected lipid features was 0.85 and 0.88 for RF and 0.79 and 0.77 for LASSO, respectively. These results show the value of RF and LASSO for metabolomics data-based biomarker development, which provide robust an independent classifiers with sparse data sets. Application of LASSO and Random Forests identifies lipid features that successfully distinguish early stage lung cancer patient from healthy individuals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent environmental pollutants originating from incomplete combustion of organic materials and synthetic sources. PAHs, PCBs, and PBDEs have all been shown to have a significant effect on human health with correlations to cancer and other diseases. Therefore, measuring the presence of these xenobiotics in the environment and human body is imperative for assessing their health risks. To date, their analyses require both gas chromatography and liquid chromatography separations in conjunction with mass spectrometry measurements for detection of both the parent molecules and their hydroxylated metabolites, making their studies extremely time consuming. In this work, we characterized PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs and their hydroxylated metabolites using ion mobility spectrometry coupled with mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) and in combination with different ionization methods including electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI). The collision cross section and m/z trend lines derived from the IMS-MS analyses displayed distinct trends for each molecule type. Additionally, the rapid isomeric and molecular separations possible with IMS-MS showed great promise for quickly distinguishing the parent and metabolized PAH, PCB, and PDBE molecules in complex environmental and biological samples.

AB Ratiometric quantitation is used in mass spectrometry to account for variations in ionization efficiencies due to heterogenous sample matrixes. Isotopes are most commonly used to achieve ratiometric quantitation because of their ability to co-elute chromatographically with each other and to have similar ionization efficiencies. In the work presented here, a new non-isotopic quantitative tagging approach is presented which allows chromatographic co-elution and similar ionization efficiencies. Using two variations of maleimide tags, t-butyl and cyclohexyl maleimide, thiols are quantified with a high degree of linearity up to five-fold concentration differences. Because these two tags have similar hydrophobcities, they elute simultaneously which allows them to be used for ratiometric quantitation. Beyond the fivefold linear range, signal compression is observed. This technique was able to quantify thiol changes in both in vitro pharmacological treatments as well as in vivo diabetic tissue.

AB Although, steroid profiling is being applied in clinical and biochemical studies, improvement of the technique is still needed for accurate quantification of steroids in case of limited biological sample volumes. To improve analytical sensitivity and selectivity in comparison to that of conventional methods, a method that comprises supported liquid extraction (SLE) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a combination of selected-reaction and selected-ion monitoring modes (GC-SRM/SIM-MS) was developed. Here, this combination of SLE purification with GC-MS method was optimized with 37 different types of steroids and the results were compared to a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method. The devised assay led to an increase in extraction efficiency with the good chromatographic selectivity through a single extraction step. The limits of quantification of the serum steroids, ranged from 0.2 to 5 ngmL(-1), except for cholesterol (0.2 mgmL(-1)), and the correlation coefficients for calibration curves were higher than 0.99. The precision and accuracy were 1.4%-10.5% and 82.7%-115.3%, respectively. The overall recoveries of 30 steroids ranged from 62.1% to 104.3%, while that of 7 sterols was 44.7%-75.7%. Then, this validated method was applied to monitor the serum steroid levels of mice, which showed significant sex and age dependent metabolic patterns. This technique can be used to evaluate the metabolic changes occurring in animal models as well as in clinical patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In analytical chemistry serum as well as plasma are recommended as sample material of choice. However, blood processing for the generation of serum or plasma is rather different. Whether plasma or serum is the preferable sample material is still controversial discussed. We performed in paired samples three UHPLC-mass spectrometry-driven metabolomics studies. In study 1 metabolite profiles of serum vs plasma were compared. 46% out of 216 identified metabolites showed significant different levels (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.05, FDR <0.01) with only three metabolites (methionine, C2:0- and C3:0-carnitine) showing lower levels in serum. In study 2 comparison of three different serum blood collection tubes revealed that coagulation and associated processes distinctly alter metabolite levels depending on the tube-specific clotting process. Most pronounced differences were found for the dipeptide phenylalanine-phenylalanine (highest levels in silicate containing serum blood collection tubes). In study 3 possible adverse effects of platelets, which still remain in standard plasma even after correct processing, were investigated. No differences in a pattern of 216 metabolites were detected in the comparison of standard and platelet-free plasma (PFP). Our results give novel insights in fundamental differences between serum and plasma, thereby providing valuable information for analytical chemists for decision making to either use serum or plasma before starting complex and time-consuming analytical investigations.

AB In the last decade, metabolomics has experienced significant advances in the throughput and robustness of analytical methodologies. Yet the preparation of biofluids and low-mass tissue samples remains a laborious and potentially inconsistent manual process, and a significant bottleneck for high-throughput metabolomics. To address this, we have compared three different sample extraction solvent systems in three diverse sample types with the purpose of selecting an optimum protocol for subsequent automation of sample preparation. We have investigated and re-optimised the solvent ratios in the recently introduced methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/methanol/water solvent system (here termed modified Matyash; 2.6/2.0/2.4, v/v/v) and compared it to the original Matyash method (10/3/2.5, v/v/v) and the conventional chloroform/methanol/water (stepwise Bligh and Dyer, 2.0/2.0/1.8, v/v/v) using two biofluids (human serum and urine) and one tissue (whole Daphnia magna). This is the first report of the use of the Matyash method for extracting metabolites from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) model organism D. magna. Extracted samples were analysed by non-targeted direct infusion mass spectrometry metabolomics or LC-MS metabolomics. Overall, the modified Matyash method yielded a higher number of peaks and putatively annotated metabolites compared to the original Matyash method (1-29% more peaks and 1-30% more metabolites) and the Bligh and Dyer method (4-20% more peaks and 1-41% more metabolites). Additionally the modified Matyash method was superior when considering metabolite intensities. The reproducibility of the modified Matyash method was higher than other methods (in 10 out of 12 datasets, compared to the original Matyash method; and in 8 out of 12 datasets, compared to the Bligh and Dyer method), based upon the observation of a lower mRSD of peak intensities. In conclusion, the modified Matyash method tended to provide a higher yield and reproducibility for most sample types in this study compared to two widely used methods. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Gas chromatography. mass spectrometry (GCMS) is an important analytical technique in metabolomics studies and has been routinely used for metabolite profiling of biological samples. Spectral matching to databases of authentic compounds are the preferred tools for metabolite identifications; however, the metabolic coverage of these databases is still limited compared to the number of known metabolites. Several computational tools have been developed to facilitate the interpretation of MS data but unfortunately most of them have limited applicability to GCMS-based metabolite identification. In this paper, we introduce a computer-aided, metabolite expert system called MetExpert which emulates the metabolite-identification ability of a human expert using orthogonal datasets including molecular formulas, retention indices, and EI-MS spectra to characterize the molecular structures. This system integrates four modules including in silico derivatization, metabolite-likeness evaluation, retention prediction, and substructure prediction. In silico derivatization increases the searchable chemical space for TMS-derivatized metabolites many of which are absent in molecular structure databases. Metabolite-likeness evaluations are an efficient approach to select metabolite-like molecules when querying large databases such as PubChem. An artificial neutral network then establishes the quantitative structure. retention relationships for the accurate prediction of RIs that further refines the candidate molecules. In addition, PLS-DA models establish quantitative structure. spectra relationships for the prediction of metabolite substructures. Finally, weighted scoring of three orthogonal evaluations increases the identification rates. MetExpert outperformed current state-of-the-art methods such as MetFrag and CFM-ID for ranking the correct identifications. While spectral comparisons with chemical standards or de novo structural elucidations are necessary to validate the predictions, MetExpert provides an efficient and effective approach to prioritize the candidates.

AB Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a key body fluid that maintains the homeostasis in central nervous system (CNS). As a biofluid whose content reflects the brain metabolic activity, the CSF has been profiled in the context of neurological diseases to provide novel insights into the disease mechanisms. However, a global high-throughput approach to measure a broad diversity of polar metabolites present in CSF is lacking. Although still perceived as challenging and less reproducible, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) has recently evolved to offer the unprecedented coverage capacity of water-soluble metabolome.
   Here, we present a global HILIC high-resolution mass spectrometry-based (HRMS) approach that combines the profiling in acidic pH ESI (thorn) and basic pH ESI (-) mode to extend the coverage of CSF polar metabolome. This approach allowed us to annotate and measure a broad range of central carbon metabolites (implicated in glycolysis, TCA cycle, nucleotide, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism) in CSF collected from cognitively healthy elderly volunteers (n - 32), using a single extraction method. Metabolite annotation was achieved using the accurate mass, RT and MS/MS criteria, allowing for the characterization of 146 measurable metabolites. Exploration of characterized individual CSF profiles allowed for a discovery of intriguing gender-associated differences, with significantly higher acylcarnitine levels in men and higher taurine levels women. With this case study, we demonstrate the value of combined HILIC ESI +/- HRMS profiling to assess CSF metabolome in clinical research studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The application of metabolomics to investigating the cell secretome has garnered popularity owing to the method's large-scale data output, biochemical insight, and prospects for novel target compound discovery. However, there are no standardized protocols for the use of cell growth media, a factor that can exert profound effects upon the detected metabolites, and thus in the interpretability of the resulting data. Herein, we applied a liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach to examine the influence of 5 different media combinations upon the obtained secretome of two phenotypically different cell lines: human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and L6 rat muscle cells. These media combinations were, M1: Medium 199, M2: Medium 199 + 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), M3: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), M4: DMEM + 2% FBS and M5: Krebs-Henseleit Modified Buffer (KHB). The effect of incubation (37 degrees C) vs. refrigeration (4 degrees C) on DMEM medium over a 24 h period was also investigated. Results were validated for a selected panel of 5 metabolites measured from an additional cell culture experiment. Metabolomics identified a total of 53 polar metabolites that exhibited differential patterns on a cell type-and medium-specific basis. We observed that choice of media was the primary contributor to the secreted metabolite profile detected. The addition of FBS resulted in unique detected metabolites, compared to media-only controls (M199 and DMEM alone). Glutamine and pyroglutamate were more abundant in incubated relative to refrigerated DMEM medium. The overall metabolic pattern of the metabolites from the targeted approach matched with that exhibited across M1-M5 of the metabolomics experiment, and aided in further identifying the presence of compounds that were below the limit of detection in metabolomics. Based upon these findings, we highlight the following considerations in designing a cell secretome-based metabolite profiling experiment: (1) multiple media combinations (with and without FBS) should be tested for each cell line to be investigated; (2) cell-free media combinations should be plated separately, and incubated/treated in the same experimental conditions as the cells; and (3) a compromise between cell death and metabolite detection should be identified in order to avoid batch-specific contributions from FBS supplementation.

AB In order to profile the lipidome for untargeted lipidomics applications, analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) typically requires the extraction of lipid content from sample matrices using matrix-specific conditions. The Folch, Bligh-Dyer, and Matyash extraction methods, while promising approaches, were originally tailored to specific matrices (brain tissue, fish muscle, and E. coli, respectively). Each of these methods have specific solvent ratios that must be adhered to achieve optimal extraction. Thus, the sample-to-solvent ratios for these methods should be optimized for the sample matrix of interest prior to employment. This study evaluated the appropriate sample-to-extraction solvent ratios for human plasma-based lipidomics studies. An advantage of employing biphasic lipid extractions is the ability to investigate both the aqueous and organic layers for increased analyte coverage in untargeted studies. Therefore, this work also evaluated the multi-omic capability of each lipid extraction method for plasma in an effort to provide a workflow capable of increasing analyte coverage in a single extraction, thus providing a more complete understanding of complex biological systems. In plasma, a decrease in sample-to-solvent ratios from 1:4, 1:10, 1:20, to 1:100 (v/v) resulted in a gradual increase in the peak area of a diverse range of metabolite (aqueous layer) and lipid (organic layer) species for each extraction method up to the 1:20(v/v) sample-to-solvent ratio. The Bligh-Dyer and Folch methods yielded the highest peak areas at every plasma sample-to-solvent ratios for both metabolite and lipid species. Depending on the lipid class of interest, the Folch or Bligh-Dyer method is best suited for analysis of human plasma at a 1:20 (v/v) sample to total solvent ratio. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The biological role of oxidized glycerophosphocholines (oxPCs) is a current topic of research importantly contributing to the understanding of health and disease. Global non-targeted metabolomics offers an interesting approach to expand current knowledge and link oxPCs to new biological functions. Although this strategy is successful, it also has some limitations which are clearly noticeable during the identification process. For this reason, clear rules related to the identification of each group of metabolites are needed. This work attempts to provide the reader with a guideline for the recognition and annotation of oxidation among phosphocholines (PCs). Using several chromatographic characteristics and spectral information from tandem mass spectrometry, rapid and reliable annotation of long and short chain oxPCs can be performed. Some of this knowledge has been implemented in the publicly available annotation tool 'CEU Mass Mediator' (CMM) for semi-automated assignment of oxidation. Additionally, this tool was supplemented with accurate monoisotopic masses of oxPCs, expanding current information in other databases. Moreover, the characterization of oxidization products of PC(16:0/20:4) known as PAPC has been performed, providing a list of accurate mass product ions and neutral losses. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Targeted quantification and untargeted global profiling are the two mainstream approaches, a merging of which could provide enhanced analytical potential in metabolomics research. Here, a simultaneous targeted quantification and untargeted metabolomics (STQUM) strategy was developed for more efficient, accurate and comprehensive metabolomics research by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS/MS). First, we selected 110 cancer-related metabolites as targets and established a dual LC sequential separation method for simultaneous analysis of strong and weak polar metabolites. In order to achieve efficient acquisition for synchronous qualitative and quantitative analysis, high-resolution, data-dependent parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) method and data-independent all ion fragmentation (AIF) method were established. Their performance in targeted confirmation and quantification, and untargeted analysis were systematically investigated and assessed. In total, 78 metabolites were confidently confirmed in positive ion mode in both PRM and AIF assays, in which 73 metabolites can be accurately quantified. In addition, simultaneously untargeted profiling of 4651 features of high reliability and validity were achieved. Both AIF and PRM methods revealed high confidence, sensitivity and accuracy. In the STQUM approach, another 15 metabolites could be accurately quantified in negative ion mode. The method offers a new perspective for merging the hypothesis-based targeted quantitative validation and untargeted biomarkers discovery in one run for improved analysis efficiency and integrity.

AB Food (dietary) supplements include a wide range of products that are designed to be taken because of their added nutrients and presumed health benefits. Global food supplement sales are experiencing rapid growth and supplements that based on botanicals are among the most popular. The meteoric rise in sales coupled with the general lack of a commitment to pass effective regulation make this market more vulnerable to dishonest producers, increase the likelihood that supplements containing adulterants are sold on the market, and a greater prevalence of safety and quality issues (contamination by pesticides and mycotoxins). In this paper, we present an overview of various sample preparation and analytical techniques that can be used for the determination of bioactive substances in food supplements based on plant extracts and for making purity assessments of plant extracts in these preparations. The analysis looks at data collected from 2012 to 2017. The work is divided according to the different approaches taken when analysing food supplements and groups of bioactive substances found in plant extracts (purity assessments and the determination of bioactive substances).

AB In the present paper, for the first time, the integrated three-electrode screen-printed sensor with in situ plated bismuth film carbon working electrode was applied for the ultratrace determination of thallium(I)(Tl(I)). Under optimized conditions extremely low limits of detection were reached, 8.47 x 10(-10) and 6.71 x 10(-12) mol L-1 for the deposition times of 60 s and 300 s, respectively. The influences of foreign metal ions and surfactants on the voltammetric signal of thallium in natural samples were minimized using 1 x 10(-5) mol L-1 EDTA and Amberlite XAD-7 resin added to the buffer solution (CH3COONH4, CH3COOH and NH4Cl) of pH = 4.6 +/- 0.1. The developed voltammetric method with integrated three-electrode screen-printed sensor was validated with use of certified reference materials (surface, rain and natural water) and can be in future applied to field analyses of Tl(I).

AB Phosphorus-doped graphene (P-RGO) was synthesized and employed as active electrode material to construct electrochemical sensor for acetaminophen (AP). The P-RGO coated glass carbon electrode (P-RGO/GCE) showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of AP, resulted from highly enhanced electrochemical conductivity and accelerated electron transfer. The experimental conditions for AP detection were optimized, and under the optimal condition, a linear relationship between current intensity and concentration of AP was obtained in the range of 1.5-120 mu M with a detection limit of 0.36 mu M(S/N = 3). The developed sensor showed high selectivity for AP in the presence of various common species, excellent reproducibility and stability. The present sensor was also successfully applied for AP detection in pharmaceutical tablet samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A highly conductive thin film composite based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and malic acid (MA) was deposited on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the selective and sensitive electrochemical sensing of trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The casting solution containing MA functionalized AgNPs was employed as a precursor for the thermal deposition of the AgNPs integratedMA thin film composite onto the GCE surface. The uniform coverage of AgNPs within the thin film composite at GCE was obtained by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A significantly high charge transfer resistance of the modified electrode (85.7 Omega for AgNPs-MA/GCE in 2 mM [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) at a bias of +0.235 V as compared to bare GCE (38.01 Omega) verified the optimum coating of AgNPs-MA composite at the surface of the electrode. The AgNPs-MA composite deposited GCE revealed substantial electrocatalytic activity toward TCA reduction with significantly enhanced reduction current. The novel electrode manifested a linear square wave voltammetric (SWV) response over the concentration ranges of 0.1-2 (R-2 = 0.9953) and 4-100 mu M (R-2 = 0.9969) with a limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 30 nM and 92.5 nM, respectively. The modified electrode exhibited an excellent long-term stability (30 days) with the retention of > 95% of initial current. The selectivity of the proposed electrode for the determination of TCA was examined in the presence of dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and monochloroacetic acid (MCA) with the retention of high recovery percentages.

AB The rational design of electrochemical methods for isomer recognition is a focus of research in the molecular recognition and separation fields. In this work, a novel, rapid, and convenient electrochemical approach for recognition of nitrophenol isomers was constructed based on the alternating layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of water-soluble cationic and anionic pillar [5] arene on a carboxylic graphene (C-Gra) modified glass carbon electrode. The electrochemical recognition of nitrophenol isomers was investigated by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The electrochemical results reveal that both the peak currents of m-nitrophenol (m-NP) and p-nitrophenol (p-NP) increased with the increasing of the layer number of the assembled pillar [5]arene, whereas the peak current of o-nitrophenol (o-NP) decreased with the increased layers, which demonstrated an efficient route for discriminating the nitrophenol isomers. The molecular recognition mechanism was studied by H-1 NMR spectra, which indicated that the m-NP and p-NP can be included in the cavity of the pillar [5]arene host. However, the o-NP could not enter into the host of pillar [5]arene, which was ascribed to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond of o-NP. The LbL assembly modified GCE was used for detecting p-NP and m-NP. A low detection limit of 0.33 mu M (S/N = 3) and a linear response range of 1-90 mu M for p-NP were obtained by using this method. And the detection limit of 0.16 mu M (S/N = 3) and a linear response range of 0.5-70 mu M for m-NP were obtained. This method of LbL assembly modified GCE has potential application in molecular recognition and separation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Probing ligand-target protein interactions provides essential information for deep understanding of biochemical machinery and design of drug screening assays. Native electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is promising for direct analysis of ligand-protein complexes. However, it lacks the ability to distinguish between specific and non-specific ligand-protein interactions, and to further recognize the specifically bound proteins as drug target candidates, which remains as a major challenge in the field of drug developments by far. Herein we report a native-denatured exchange (NDX) mass spectrometry (MS) acquisition approach using a liquid sample-desorption electrospray ionization (LS-DESI) setup, and demonstrate its capability in enabling a change from native detection of noncovalent ligand-protein complexes to denatured analysis using three model ligand-protein complexes including myoglobin, CDP-ribonuclease and N, N', N ''-triacetylchitotriose (NAG3)-lysozyme. Notably, we found the NDX-MS approach can readily discriminate specific ligand-protein interactions from nonspecific ones, as revealed by their distinct dynamic profiles of K-d as a function of the DESI spraying flow rate. Consequently, this NDX-MS approach holds promise for future applications to discovering specific protein targets for ligands of interest, and to screening compounds with high specificity to drug targets and thus eliminates off-target effects.

AB Large-scale quantitative mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and proteomics study requires the longterm analysis of multiple batches of biological samples, which often accompanied with significant signal drift and various inter- and intra-batch variations. The unwanted variations can lead to poor inter- and intra-day reproducibility, which is a hindrance to discover real significance. The use of quality control samples and data treatment strategies in the quality assurance procedure provides a mechanism to evaluate the quality and remove the analytical variance of the data. The statTarget we developed is a streamlined tool with an easy-to-use graphical user interface and an integrated suite of algorithms specifically developed for the evaluation of data quality and removal of unwanted variations for quantitative mass spectrometry-based omics data. A novel quality control-based random forest signal correction algorithm, which can remove inter- and intra-batch unwanted variations at feature-level was implanted in the statTarget. Our evaluation based on real samples showed the developed algorithm could improve the data precision and statistical accuracy for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and proteomics data. Additionally, the statTarget offers the streamlined procedures for data imputation, data normalization, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and feature selection. To conclude, the statTarget allows user-friendly the improvement of the data precision for uncovering the biologically differences, which largely facilitates quantitative mass spectrometry-based omics data processing and statistical analysis.

AB We report the identification and use of a mutant of the purine selective ribonuclease RNase U2 that randomly cleaves RNA in a manner that is directly compatible with RNA modification mapping by mass spectrometry. A number of RNase U2 mutants were generated using site-saturation mutagenesis. The enzyme activity and specificity were tested using oligonucleotide substrates, which revealed an RNase U2 E49A mutant with limited specificity and a tendency to undercut RNA. Using this mutant, RNA digestion conditions were optimized to yield long, overlapping digestion products, which improve sequence coverage in RNA modification mapping experiments. The analytical utility of this mutant was demonstrated by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) mapping of several modified RNAs where 100% sequence coverage could be obtained using only a single enzymatic digestion. This new mutant facilitates more accurate and efficient RNA modification mapping than traditional highly base-specific RNases that are currently used. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cronobacter spp. are recognized as a world-wide emerging opportunistic food-borne pathogens that can persist in various food and processing environment for a long time. Therefore, the prevention and detection of them are particularly important. In this study, a micro-spot paper-based analytical device (mu PADs) was created by combining PVC pad with filter paper. Detection is achieved by measuring the color change (from colorless to indigo) when a species-specific enzyme associated with the Cronobacter spp. of interest reacts with a chromogenic substrate. When combined with the optimization of specific enrichment process, the method allows for a testing time of 10 h or less and is capable of detecting live bacteria on the inoculated surface of samples in concentrations as low as 10(1) CFU cm(-2). We are surprised to discover that C. dublinensis species and their subspecies had the highest ability to produce alpha-glucosidase in all genus of Cronobacter spp.. This work demonstrated that the manufacturing method is novel, simple, well reproducible (RSD less than 5%) and low-cost (less than $ 0.15 per micro-spot). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study describes the development of paper-based devices for the determination of biothiols. The devices are inexpensive (composed of paper and silver halide particles), and the analytical protocol is easily executable with minimum technical expertise and without the need of specialized equipment; the user has to add a test sample, illuminate the device with a UV lamp, and read the color change of the sensing area using a simple imaging device (i.e., cell-phone camera) or a bare eye. The detection mechanism of the assay is based on the biothiols-mediated photoreduction of nanometer-sized silver chloride particles deposited on the surface of paper; photoreduced silver chloride particles have a grayish coloration that depends on the concentration of biothiols in the tested solution. This is the first time that the UV-mediated photoreduction of solid silver halides particles is used for analytical purposes. The performance of the devices has been tested on the detection of total biothiols content of artificial body fluids and proteine-free human blood plasma samples, and the results were satisfactory in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, recoveries and reproducibility.

AB The ability to rapidly screen drugs and drug delivery systems with a more accurate tumor model to better predict their in vivo performance is of great importance in drug development, because there have been some limitations in currently used tumor models. To address this problem, we developed an in vitro breast tumor model on a chip, composed of a microvessel wall, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and uniformly sized multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS), for the evaluation of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. A carbon dots (CDs)-based drug delivery system was synthesized as a model to evaluate the real-time monitoring ability of the system transport through the endothelium and the penetrability into MCTS with a high spatio-temporal resolution on the established platform. Moreover, a modified 96-well plate was used to hold the microfluidic devices for in situ cytotoxicity assays of the MCTS by a microplate reader. Our findings revealed that the synthesized drug delivery system could be transported across an endothelial monolayer within 3 h and was nontoxic to the cells throughout the experiment. In addition, we demonstrated the capabilities of this model by assessing the delivery and efficacy of the drug delivery system in BT549 and T47D spheroids, two cell lines representative of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC, respectively. This microfluidic platform enables evaluation of dynamic transport behavior and in situ cytotoxicity evaluation in one system. The established platform provides a more accurate and low-cost in vitro model for rapid drug screening in pre-clinical studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In current study, we have found that several magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are able to absorb DNA molecules, and surface engineering would be beneficial to tune such interaction. We then have focused on the assembly of polyethylenimine (PEI) coated MNPs (PEI-MNPs) with ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) and found this assembly is mediated by two forces, namely the electrostatic interactions of surface charges of MNPs and the phosphate backbones of DNA; as well as the coordination of exterior iron ions (especially Fe3+) of MNPs and DNA phosphate backbones. The fluorescence of dye-labeled DNA is significantly quenched when being complexed with PEI-MNPs, which is proved to be caused by static quenching. This PEI-MNPs interact with DNA, which could be harnessed for devising a novel type of aptasensor. This has been examplified by the selective and sensitive detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The LOD (limit of detection) is similar to 35 ng/mL and the linear range from 50 ng/mL to 10 mu g/mL. Compared with widely used graphene oxide (GO)-ssDNA aptamer sensors, we also have demonstrated that the PEI-MNPs based sensor is able to better avoid non-specific DNA displacement by interfering proteins, generating more satisfactory signal-to-background ratio. Our proposed sensor could be a supplement to classic GO. DNA sensors. In summary, our work provides fundamental understanding of MNPs-DNA interactions and also paves the way for developing novel MNPs based sensing approaches, which would contribute to nano-bio interface and DNA-assisted bio-analysis, DNA-coordinated nano-materials and DNA-directed assembly.

AB In biosensors development, alginate hydrogels are a first choice for enabling stable biomolecules entrapment in biocompatible membranes obtained under soft physiological conditions. Although widely exploited, most alginate membranes are isolating and poorly repetitive, which limit their application in biosensing. Significant steps forward on improving repeatability and conductivity have been performed, but to date there is no single protocol for controlled deposition of live cells in replicable conductive alginate layers. Here, cell electrotrapping in conductive alginate hydrogels is examined in order to overcome these limitations. Conductive alginate-coated electrodes are obtained after potentiostatic electrodeposition of graphite-doped alginate samples (up to 4% graphite). The presence of graphite reduces electrode passivation and improves the electrochemical response of the sensor, although still significantly lower than that recorded with the naked electrode. Bacterial electrotrapping in the conductive matrix is highly efficient (4.4 x 10(7) cells per gel) and repetitive (CV < 0.5%), and does not compromise bacterial integrity or activity (cell viability = 56%). Biosensing based on ferricyanide respirometry yielded a four times increase in biosensor response with respect to non-conductive alginate membrane, providing toxicity values completely comparable to those reported. Cell electrotrapping in conductive hydrogels represents a step forward towards in high-sensitive cell-based biosensors development with important influence in environmental analysis, food and beverage industry as well as clinical diagnosis.

AB A novel nanostructured biosensing platform was designed based on two-dimensional (2D) nano-composite of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets and MoS2 quantum dots (MoS2 QDs), followed by decoration with chitosan-stabilized Au nanoparticles (CS-AuNPs) (denoted as MoS(2)QDs@g-C3N4@CS-AuNPs), of which CS-AuNPs were prepared by plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition. Owning to the good surface plasmon performance of the CS-AuNPs and excellent electrochemical activity of MoS(2)QDs@g-C3N4 nanosheets, the as-obtained 2D MoS(2)QDs@g-C3N4@CS-AuNPs nanocomposite was simultaneously explored to construct both surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) sensor and electrochemical aptasensor. The MoS(2)QDs@g-C3N4@CS-AuNPs-based aptasensor shows strong bio-binding affinity toward the prostate specific antigen (PSA) targeted aptamer strands as compared to the individual component, including MoS2 QDs, g-C3N4, and CS-AuNPs. When detecting PSA, the low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.71 pg mL(-1) deduced by electrochemical aptasensor is three orders of magnitude lower than that deduced by SPR sensor (0.77 ng mL(-1)). As expected, both SPR sensor and electrochemical aptasensor demonstrate good selectivity, highly stability, acceptable reproducibility, and well consistent applicability in human serum. The satisfactory results suggest potential application of the MoS(2)QDs@g-C3N4@CS-AuNPs in bifunctional biosensing fields and clinical monitoring of cancer markers. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
