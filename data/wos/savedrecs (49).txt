AB The strong scattering of the microstructures severely weakens light transmitted through the atmosphere-plasma-sprayed (APS) thermal barrier coating system (TBCs), which poses a great challenge to indicate APS TBCs delamination using optical inspection method. In this paper, to indicate the delamination in APS TBCs, an innovative method was proposed based on a luminescent sublayer that produces significantly greater emission intensity from delaminated regions of the TBCs. The top coat was prepared with a Eu3+-doped yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ:Eu3+) luminescent layer below an undoped YSZ layer. The delamination was prepared using a dissolved salt method. Specimens were vacuum-impregnated with mineral oil to improve the transparency of the coating, and thus to reduce the effects of pores and microcracks on luminescence signal. For specimens with a Eu3+-doped YSZ luminescent sublayer, luminescence intensity mapping showed excellent contrast between the delaminated region and the surrounding adherent region.

AB Novel aluminum and indium doped zinc oxide (ZnO) bilayer transparent conducting oxide thin films was fabricated by simple sol-gel spin coating method and post-annealed at 500 degrees C for an hour under nitrogen ambient for solar cell applications. The structural, electrical and optical properties of both the as-deposited and annealed bilayer thin films were characterized. X-ray diffraction studies show a hexagonal wurtzite-type structure of ZnO with (002) orientation, which enhanced with annealing. In atomic force microscopy studies, minimum surface roughness was attained for Al-doped ZnO (AZO)/In-doped ZnO (IZO) bilayer TCO film compared to IZO/AZO bilayer film. The AZO/IZO film sheet resistance improved to 0.057 M ohm/square after post-annealing, while the single layer AZO film sheet resistance degraded upon annealing in nitrogen atmosphere. All the films had an average transmittance in the visible region over 96%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we studied the effect of inert ion implantation using helium and xenon ions on residual stress gradients in copper films. A copper microcantilever beam array was fabricated on a (100) silicon wafer by conventional bulk micromachining. The as-fabricated copper microcantilevers showed upward bending deformation as a result of positive residual stress gradient in films. Helium and xenon ions were implanted at various doses and energies into microcantilevers before releasing them from substrates. The magnitudes and signs of residual stress gradients were effectively controlled by both helium and xenon ion implantation and depended on implantation energy and ionic dosages. The mechanism of residual stress control appeared to involve counterbalancing residual stress gradients with compressive residual stresses induced by volume expansions of implanted regions and the direct effect of surface modification by ion bombardment.

Here, we hybridize VO2 with a Ni-II-I-TMP complexes and then fabricate a novel composite VO2/NIT film. The composite film shows a ultra-high solar modulation efficiency (Delta T-sol = 27.3%), relatively high luminous transmittance (T-lum,(I) = 61.3% and T-lum,T-h = 36.2%) and visible color modulation ability. Our novel broadband modulation composite film exhibits superior application potential in smart window application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A uniform magnetic field was applied to prepare Ni-epoxy resin functionally graded material (FGM) with gradient and anisotropy both in microstructures and resulting properties. By moving a magnetic field imposed on the green sample perpendicular to the field direction from one end to the other, Ni particles were driven by the field and distributed gradually in epoxy resin matrix. The gradient of light transmittance and electrical resistivity reflected the graded structures in Ni-epoxy resin composite. Furthermore, Ni particles aggregated to form chain clusters along the field direction, which produced anisotropic electrical properties in direction along and perpendicular to the chains. It has been clearly proved that the magnetic-field-driving method is a facile and effective attempt to prepare FGMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY
AB In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the incoming sunlight can influence many of the key electron transfer processes occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. So, the intensity of incident light is crucial in determining the overall efficiency of the devices. Here, transparent DSSC exhibiting an average light transmittance of 53% and high energy conversion efficiency (5.93%) is fabricated. A low solar concentrator with 3X optical concentration is coupled with the device to improve the photovoltaic performance without affecting its transparency. The internal resistances of the fabricated transparent DSSCs with and without the low solar concentrator are analysed using impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate that the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface of concentrator coupled devices are lower than the bare devices. Moreover, the device active area is scaled up and charge transport properties are compared with a low concentrator coupled device. The overall results show that the concentrator coupled device performs better than the scaled-up device. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cadmium Sulphide (CdS) thin films were deposited on to well-cleaned soda lime glass substrates using hot wall deposition technique at room temperature. The structure of CdS thin films was found to be hexagonal with < 0 0 2 > orientation and after annealing the film crystallized to < 0 0 2 >, < 1 0 1 >, < 1 0 2 >, < 1 1 2 > directions. Raman Spectroscopy confirmed the hexagonal structure with a shift at 312 cm(1). SAED pattern from the Transmission electron microscopy also confirmed the formation of hexagonal CdS. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy confirmed the formation of CdS with relevant at% of Cd and S. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images revealed smooth surface of the thin film with distinctive grains. Atomic force microscopy results showed a surface roughness of 4.47 nm. Transmission spectra of the films were studied and the transparency was found to be above 80%. The optical band gap was found to be around 2.4 eV in accordance with the reported values. The results show that device quality buffer layers can be deposited using Hot-wall deposition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel route to the synthesis of boron carbonitride (BC1.61N0.76) micro-nano structures called nanosheet-decorated submicrowires is demonstrated for the first time, by annealing amorphous boron powder, natural rubber latex and ferric chloride (FeCl3) at 1200 degrees C in flowing ammonia atmosphere. The microwires have diameters of about 200-500 nm, while the nanosheets have an average thickness of less than 20 nm. The nanosheets are mostly separated with a bending and crumpling morphology. This micro-nano structure shows good visible-light emission property at 501.2 and 592.6 nm. A combination growth mechanism of vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) and vapor-solid (VS) model is proposed to be responsible for the formation of this BC1.61N0.76 micro-nano structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Copper oxide (CuO) nanostructures, such as nanoshuttles, nanodisks and nanoparticles are synthesized by simple hydrothermal and wet chemical methods. The CuO nanostructures are prepared by thermal dehydration of Cu(OH)(2)center dot H2O crystal hydrate without any additives. The CuO nanostructures are characterized by energy dispersive X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EDAS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The SEM images show that diameter of CuO nanoshuttles ranges from 300-400 nm and length of similar to 1 mu m. The platelet-like porous CuO nanoparticles have thickness of 0.2-0.4 mu m and width of 0.5-1.5 mu m. The CuO nanodisks have diameter of 500-700 nm and thickness of 60-120 nm. The EDAS analysis confirms purity of CuO samples. The FTIR spectra of CuO nanostructures exhibit that the vibration peaks correspond to stretching vibrations of Cu-O bond. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, a convenient oxidants free acid polymerization method is developed to synthesize poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). p-Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) is served as catalyst to direct polymerization of EDOT. The electron spin resonance spectra revealed that EDOT was protonated into radical species under p-TsOH. As-obtained PEDOT has a highest average degree of polymerization of 11.3 and the structure details are characterized by H-1 NMR, GPC and FTIR. An acid promoted EDOT protonation polymerization mechanism is proposed and clarified. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CLAD COMPOSITE; DEFORMATION; STEEL
AB Al/Cu claddings were fabricated by caliber-rolling process at 298 K and their mechanical and microstructural properties were evaluated. The Vickers hardness (VH) value of the Al layer in the claddings increase with increasing strain, however, it decreased when the strain was over 0.48. For Cu layer, the VH value rose with strain. The grain size of the Al layer in the cladding decreased with increasing strain and then the grain size increased with a strain of over 0.48. In the case of Cu layer, the grain size increased with increasing strain of the cladding. The relationship between hardness and grain size follows the Hall-Petch equation. During, dynamic recovery is pronounced in the Cu layer, however, grain growth only take place in the Al layer. The evolution of texture is due to a difference in stacking fault energy (SFE) between Cu and Al. The Al layer, with a low SFE, exhibits stronger texture than the Cu layer because of different deformation mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biodegradable conductive nanocomposite fiber membrane based on polyindole (PIn) and bacterial cellulose (BC) has been prepared by in situ polymerization of indole in the presence of electrospun BC nano-fibers activated in acidic medium. The PIn/BC nanocomposite fiber membrane was characterized by SEM, FT-IR and electrical conductivity. The biodegradability was evaluated in natural soil and simulated body fluid. The antibacterial activity was analyzed using E. coli and S. aureus bacteria. The results revealed that the PIn/BC nanocomposite fiber membrane has good antibacterial performance as well as biodegradability, which might have potential applications in biomedical field, food packaging, electronic device, and biosensors.

AB ZSM-5 with high silica have been emerging as one of the most promising materials for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Although various synthesis methods have been reported, synthesis of ZSM-5 with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio through crystal seeds method still remains a challenge. Herein, a facile method for ZSM-5 with improved SiO2/Al2O3 ratio was developed on the basis of synergy between crystal seeds and amphiphilic organosilane surfactant. In this strategy, the improved SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZSM-5 was obtained from the decreased introduction amount of Al species into zeolite framework due to the presence of -Si-(OH)(3). In addition, intracrystalline mesopores were constructed by the introduction of amphiphilic surfactants. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oxides LiNixCoyMn2-x-yO4+delta d (x, y = 1/3, 1/4) were synthesized at 800 degrees C by sol-gel (SG) and sol-gelassisted ultrasound (UASG) methods. The Rietveld refinement of the XRD data indicated that all the compounds crystallize in the spinel structure and allowed to propose the corresponding cation distributions. SEM and TEM images showed that the oxides prepared by both methods consist of irregular polyhedra in the submicron size range. The samples prepared by UASG have both higher surface areas and Li+ ion diffusion coefficients than those synthesized by the SG method. XPS studies of these oxides reveal the presence of Ni2+, Ni3+, Co3+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions on the surface. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SEVERE PLASTIC-DEFORMATION; EVOLUTION; ALLOYS; COPPER
AB We observed that high pressure torsion (HPT) of a bi-metallic laminate can induce vortex-like folding instabilities of layers. Thus, HPT leads to multiscale swirls which are perpendicular to the anvil axis. These instabilities are similar to folding of metallic surfaces during sliding and to co-axial swirls by HPT. The HPT induced vortex-like instabilities look very similar to the Kelvin-Helmholtz-type flow instabilities in fluids. We demonstrate in this work that this similarity is only apparent, and physical reasons for HPT-induced instabilituies are principally different from those in liquids. We show using finite element simulations that the folding and vortices of metallic layers are driven by plastic instabilities due to local blocking of shear deformation. Thus, HPT of layered samples leads to the multiscale movement of vortices in the material during deformation. These movements resemble turbulent flow of liquids and gases, but they have a completely different physical nature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polymeric adsorbents normally need to be chemically crosslinked to be effective in aggressive scenarios, which thus triggers the non-recyclable concern of crosslinked plastics. In this study, we firstly synthesized a novel thermoplastic polyarylene ether nitrile (PEN) block copolymer containing pendant carboxyl and sulfonate groups, which were employed to prepare the sub-micrometer PEN spheres with rough surface and porous morphology via a Fe3+ mediated emulsion self-assembling protocol. Furthermore, the obtained PEN microspheres (MS) demonstrated a maximum adsorption capacity of 738 mg/g towards methylene blue (MB), and more than 90% of MB can be removed at 90 degrees C for 5 min.

AB Highexothermic type of reaction synthesis of TiC prevents obtaining stable dimensionally composite reinforcement in castings based on Fe alloys. The article presents a new method of in situ manufacturing of local composite reinforcement in ductile iron casting. The synthesis of TiC was performed by placing the substrates of reaction of its formation in a steel tube. A preform rod containing the substrates was placed in mould cavity and then poured the liquid casting alloy prevents in the same time the fragmentation of composite reinforcement during the synthesis reaction. As a result, composite casting with TiC reinforcement was obtained. The preform placed in a mould cavity showed thermal stability and was not melted. The presence of ceramic phase in a form of TiC caused the increase of hardness by more than 300%, when compared to matrix alloy. Workout method is a good candidate to obtain structural reinforcements in castings on Fe-based alloy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A NaCl-containing water droplet covered by simulated diluted bitumen was used to mimic the internal corrosion scenario that pipelines transporting diluted bitumen may encounter. The NaCl-containing droplet on the X100 pipeline steel shrank to a smaller droplet under the action of the simulated diluted bitumen. Hematite and lepidocrocite were identified in the corrosion products formed in the shrunken droplet. The dissolution of X100 pipeline steel primarily occurred at the edge of the central ring of the shrunken droplet. The corrosion attack morphology seen under these conditions is quite different from that of previous investigations for salty droplets in open air. The results point to a new mechanism of internal corrosion possibly appearing in diluted bitumen pipelines. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that requires those affected to self-administer insulin to control their blood glucose level. However, the estimation of the correct insulin dosage is not easy due to the complexity of glucose metabolism, which usually leads to blood glucose levels far from the optimal. This paper presents an adaptive and personalised basal insulin recommender system based on Kalman filter theory that can be used with or without continuous glucose monitoring systems. The proposed approach is tested with the UVa/PADOVA simulator with eleven virtual adult subjects. It has been tested in combination with two different bolus calculators, and the performance achieved has been compared with that obtained with the default basal doses of the simulator, which can be assumed as optimal. The achieved results demonstrate that the proposed system rapidly converges to the optimal basal dose, and it can be used with adaptive bolus calculators without the risk of instability.

TI Fault-tolerant tile mining

DE Itemset mining; Fault-tolerant; Optimization; Exact algorithm
AB Interesting itemset mining is a fundamental research problem in knowledge management and machine learning. It is intended to identify interesting relations between variables in a database using some measures of interestingness and has a number of applications, including market basket analysis, web usage mining, intrusion detection, and many others. This paper proposes a new interestingness measure, the fault-tolerant tile. That is based on two observations: (1) the length of an itemset can be as important as its frequency; (2) knowledge discovery from real-world datasets calls for fault -tolerant data mining (e.g. extracting fault -tolerant association rules, analyzing noisy datasets). Given a user-defined fault tolerance value, we are interested in finding the maximum/top-k fault-tolerant tiles. Due to the exponential search space of candidate itemsets, both problems are NP-hard. While using some monotonic property to prune search space is a common strategy for interesting itemset mining, no monotonic property is available for this problem. To tackle the challenge, we utilize the branch-and-bound search strategy to analyze the characteristics of candidate itemsets at each searching branch and estimating their bounds. Our experimental results show that our algorithms can effectively analyze real datasets and retrieve meaningful results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Use of CCTV is growing rapidly in surveillance applications. Rapid advancement in machine learning and camera hardware has opened-up adequate scopes to build next generation of expert systems aiming at understanding surveillance environments automatically by detection of trajectory abnormality through analyzing object behavior. Such intelligent surveillance systems should be able to learn and combine multiple concepts of abnormality in real-life scenario and classify the events of interest as normal or abnormal. Primary challenges of such systems are to represent and learn patterns in surveillance scenes and combine multiple concepts of abnormalities to activate the alarm system.
   This paper presents a graph-based representation of a given surveillance scene and learning of relevant features including origin, destination, path, speed, size, etc. These features are combined and correlated with target behaviors to detect abnormalities in moving object trajectories. We also propose an aggregation method that reduces the number of missed alarms during aggregation. Several cases using publicly available surveillance video datasets have been presented and the results indicate that the proposed method can be useful to design intelligent and expert surveillance systems.

ID GAIT RECOGNITION; IMAGE; TEMPLATE; DISTANCE
AB Biometric technology based on human gait identifies humans at a far distance even if the individual's face is covered, hidden, or not visible to cameras in dark environments. Previous studies based on human gait were conducted considering both bright and dark environments for human identification in surveillance systems. The studies conducted in low-illumination environments (dark environments) are based on side view images (horizontal walking) of subjects. However, there are cases in which people only show the front and back views of their bodies while they are walking in low-illumination corridors. In these views, it is difficult to identify humans by using conventional features such as cycle, cadence, stride length of walking, and distance between points (ankle, knee, and hip). Additionally, the cases of problems such as people carrying cellphones and/or small personal items (a purse, bag, clothes, etc.) have critical effects on the accuracy of human identification. To overcome these problems, we propose a new human identification technique, which is based on the front and back view images of a human, captured by using a thermal camera sensor. Our technique uses movements of the human body for identification, particularly movement of the head, shoulders, and legs. We have used a convolutional neural network for feature extraction and classification in this study. Five datasets were compiled by collecting data of 80 people including men and women in both bright and dark environments. The experimental results with our collected data and open database showed a higher performance by using our method compared to those of previous studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Encrypted communication on the Internet using the HTTPs protocol represents a challenging task for network intrusion detection systems. While it significantly helps to preserve users' privacy, it also limits a detection system's ability to understand the traffic and effectively identify malicious activities. In this work, we propose a method for modeling and representation of encrypted communication from logs of web communication. The idea is based on introducing communication snapshots of individual users' activity that model contextual information of the encrypted requests. This helps to compensate the information hidden by the encryption. We then propose statistical descriptors of the communication snapshots that can be consumed by various machine learning algorithms for either supervised or unsupervised analysis of the data. In the experimental evaluation, we show that the presented approach can be used even on a large corpus of network traffic logs as the process of creation of the descriptors can be effectively implemented on a Hadoop cluster.

AB Most of the existing query engines built into modern e-commerce platforms retrieve products by means of text and numerical matching. Conventional query engines for conducting product search suffer from several problems because of which they are not good product recommendation engines. First, they solve tasks without considering semantic uncertainties in users' questions and in data and therefore do not consider partial matching of query conditions. Users may need to input imprecise information to express their preferences or data describing products can be imprecise as well. Second, existing query engines used for conducting product search tasks do not consider conformance among tuples' features and aggregation of atomic conditions of different nature. Fuzzy query approaches solve majority of problems related to semantic uncertainty, but do not cover all possible flexibilities to a sufficient level. When user defines sharp conditions (even though he might have values similar to provided ones in mind), entity either fully matches or fundamentally differs, regardless of the similarity between feature's value and the value appearing in conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach to suggesting suitable products based on fuzzy conformance between features appearing in the vector of the ideal product from customer's point of view and the features of existing products. In the second stage, several aggregations of atomic conditions for calculating overall matching between user's needs and available products in a data set are discussed. In addition, our approach is able to manage customers' requirements expressed by constraints (features which should be met) and wishes (it is nice if these features are met) by the and if possible operator. Thus, asymmetric conjunction is an effective way to capture them. Experiments on a data set of used cars have shown promising results. Proposed fuzzy query engine considers some complex behaviors such as imprecise preferences, vague data in datasets, constraints and wishes in users' requirements without previous history of queries, suggested answers, feedbacks, gathered ratings and customers' personal data. It provides application in a specific domain of intelligent systems. The proposed framework can be adapted in a straightforward manner to any system for recommending suitable products, especially for the less-frequently purchased ones. Moreover, businesses that are not able to build or manage complex recommendation systems for gathering customer's behavioral data, as well as customers who are concerned with privacy risks might have benefit from this approach.

AB Motion estimation (ME) plays an important part in the functioning of the video codec by identifying and reducing the temporal redundancies in between successive frames of a video sequence. Block matching algorithm (BMA) has been accepted as one of the finest approaches for motion estimation due to its efficiency and ease of implementation. This paper presents a new and improved iterative and adaptive search strategy for block-based motion estimation along with its efficient hardware implementation. Since it is expected that there will be more demand for streaming video services on mobile devices, designing fine tuning algorithm with dedicated efficient hardware would provide significant benefits. The present motion estimation algorithm is adaptive in nature that takes into consideration the motion content of the current frame while predicting the motion vector. The adaptive nature of the search eases the complexity of motion estimation and the algorithm makes use of the correlation present among the motion vectors of the neighboring blocks to lower the number of search position. Traditionally, such adaptive algorithms are executed by CPU cores running a software stack. Since software involves a significant amount of overheads like fetching into cache, branches, stalls etc., the efficiency of the proposed algorithm can be overshadowed by the hardware platform. To avoid this, compact hardware architecture was developed which stands ahead of other existing architectures as shown in comparison. The VLSI design for the proposed algorithm presented in this work deals with the generation of the adaptive search pattern and use of interleaved memory organization fasten the operational speed. A profitable data re-use scheme and involvement of minimum processing elements required for parallelization reduce the on-chip area. Working at a frequency of 243 MHz, the proposed design can process 66 720p HD (1280 x 720) frames in one second consuming an area of 38.2 K gate equivalent. Hence, the proposed design can be incorporated in video codecs to be used in commercial devices like camcorders, smart phones and other portable, battery-powered video consumer devices. The proposed research method achieves significantly improved results both in terms of algorithmic metrics (PSNR) as well hardware performance (speed, area). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper reports the results of an experiment to identify EEG patterns specific to different levels of player involvement when playing a video game. To obtain unbiased results, we based our patterns on both raw EEG data and expert knowledge. We used a three-step procedure to identify patterns. First, we looked for clusters in the reduced feature space extracted from EEG data. Next, we assigned experts' interpretations to the clusters. Finally, we analysed relations between features used to form the clusters and the class labels provided by experts. The most challenging part of the procedure was feature selection simultaneous with unsupervised classification. To accomplish this task, we developed a new approach for simultaneous feature selection and clustering based on modified GAAM (genetic algorithm with aggressive mutation). When the cGAAM algorithm was applied to EEG data, it returned the feature subsets that (a) were highly consistent across subjects and (b) provided 50% more compact clusters than clusters built over the feature subsets returned by a forward selection search strategy.
   The main cognitive outcome of EEG signal analysis was a set of patterns differentiating players' involvement in a game. Conclusions included: 1. For a majority of subjects the most discriminative features were activity in the theta band in the left and right frontal areas, and activity in the delta band in the left frontal area; 2. All three features significantly differentiated between low and high, or medium and high engagement; 3. All subjects showed positive correlations between selected feature values and levels of engagement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate estimation of the biomass of roadside grasses plays a significant role in applications such as fire-prone region identification. Current solutions heavily depend on field surveys, remote sensing measurements and image processing using reference markers, which often demand big investments of time, effort and cost. This paper proposes Density Weighted Connectivity of Grass Pixels (DWCGP) to automatically estimate grass biomass from roadside image data. The DWCGP calculates the length of continuously connected grass pixels along a vertical orientation in each image column, and then weights the length by the grass density in a surrounding region of the column. Grass pixels are classified using feedforward artificial neural networks and the dominant texture orientation at every pixel is computed using multi-orientation Gabor wavelet filter vote. Evaluations on a field survey dataset show that the DWCGP reduces Root-Mean-Square Error from 5.84 to 5.52 by additionally considering grass density on top of grass height. The DWCGP shows robustness to non-vertical grass stems and to changes of both Gabor filter parameters and surrounding region widths. It also has performance close to human observation and higher than eight baseline approaches, as well as promising results for classifying low vs. high fire risk and identifying fire-prone road regions.

AB In this work we introduce the multi-loading school bus routing problem which extends the rural school bus routing problem with mixed loads by incorporating an innovative feature here referred to as multi load. Whereas the mixed load variant allows students from different schools to ride the same bus at the same time, the multi-load model expands this definition by admitting students to be picked up and delivered simultaneously, regardless of their shift, commuting direction (going to or returning from school) or school, giving thus more flexibility to managers on lowering transportation costs. The multi-load feature has a great social and economic appeal, specially to developing countries that usually have double or triple shifts for schooling, and budget restrictions. The advantages and disadvantages of the new model are discussed and highlighted in our experiments which report the attained savings when compared with the mixed load approach for routing the students situated in rural areas of all 76 cities of the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. To solve these large scale, real instances, different meta-heuristics were devised which combine an iterated local search with specialized neighborhood structures arranged in a variable neighborhood descent strategy enriched with a diversification scheme which relies on an elite set. The attained results demonstrate that the multi-loading approach can substantially reduce the solutions' cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A wide variety of feature selection methods have been developed as promising solutions to find the classification pattern inside increasing applications. But the exploring efficient, flexible and robust feature selection method to handle the rising big data is still an exciting challenge. This paper presents a novel hierarchical co-evolutionary clustering tree-based rough feature game equilibrium selection algorithm (CTFGES). It aims to select out the high-quality feature subsets, which can enrich the research of feature selection and classification in the heterogeneous big data. Firstly, we construct a flexible hierarchical co-evolutionary clustering tree model to speed up the process of feature selection, which can effectively extract the features from the parent and children branches of four-layer co-evolutionary clustering tree. Secondly, we design a mixed co-evolutionary game equilibrium scheme with adaptive dynamics to guide parent and children branch subtrees to approach the optimal equilibrium regions, and enable their feature sets to converge stably to the Nash equilibrium. So both noisy heterogeneous features and non-identified redundant ones can be further eliminated. Finally, the extensive experiments on various big datasets are conducted to demonstrate the more excellent performance of CTFGES, in terms of accuracy, efficiency and robustness, compared with the representative feature selection algorithms. In addition, the proposed CTFGES algorithm has been successfully applied into the feature segmentation of large-scale neonatal cerebral cortex MRI with varying noise ratios and intensity non-uniformity levels. The results indicate that it can be adaptive to derive from the cortical folding surfaces and achieves the satisfying consistency with medical experts, which will be potential significance for successfully assessing the impact of aberrant brain growth on the neurodevelopment of neonatal cerebrum.

AB Designing tax policies that are effective in curbing tax evasion and maximize state revenues requires a rigorous understanding of taxpayer behavior. This work explores the problem of determining the strategy a self-interested, risk-averse tax entity is expected to follow, as it "navigates" - in the context of a Markov Decision Process - a government-controlled tax environment that includes random audits, penalties and occasional tax amnesties. Although simplified versions of this problem have been previously explored, the mere assumption of risk-aversion (as opposed to risk-neutrality) raises the complexity of finding the optimal policy well beyond the reach of analytical techniques. Here, we obtain approximate solutions via a combination of Q-learning and recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning. By doing so, we (i) determine the tax evasion behavior expected of the taxpayer entity, (ii) calculate the degree of risk aversion of the "average" entity given empirical estimates of tax evasion, and (iii) evaluate sample tax policies, in terms of expected revenues. Our model can be useful as a testbed for "in-vitro" testing of tax policies, while our results lead to various policy recommendations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

   Video surveillance
ID CLASSIFICATION; ENSEMBLES; RECOGNITION
AB In practice, pattern recognition applications often suffer from imbalanced data distributions between classes, which may vary during operations w.r.t. the design data. For instance, in many video surveillance applications, e.g., face re-identification, the face individuals must be recognized over a distributed network of video cameras. An important challenge in such applications is class imbalance since the number of faces captured from an individual of interest is greatly outnumbered by those of others. Two-class classification systems designed using imbalanced data tend to recognize the majority (negative) class better, while the class of interest (positive class) often has the smaller number of samples. Several data-level techniques have been proposed to alleviate this issue, where classifier ensembles are designed with balanced data subsets by up-sampling positive samples or under-sampling negative samples. However, some informative samples may be neglected by random under-sampling and adding synthetic positive samples through up-sampling adds to training complexity. In this paper, a new ensemble learning algorithm called Progressive Boosting (PBoost) is proposed that progressively inserts uncorrelated groups of samples into a Boosting procedure to avoid loosing information while generating a diverse pool of classifiers. In many real-world recognition problems, the samples may be regrouped using some application-based contextual information. For example, in face re-identification applications, facial regions of a same person appearing in a camera field of view may be regrouped based on their trajectories found by face tracker. From one iteration to the next, the PBoost algorithm accumulates these uncorrelated groups of samples into a set that grows gradually in size and imbalance. Base classifiers are trained on samples selected from this set and validated on the whole set. Consequently, PBoost is more robust when the operational data may have unknown and variable levels of skew. In addition, the computation complexity of PBoost is lower than Boosting ensembles in literature that use under-sampling for learning from imbalanced data because not all of the base classifiers are validated on all negative samples. The new loss factor used in PBoost avoids biasing performance towards the negative class. Using this loss factor, the weight update of samples and classifier contribution in final predictions are set according to the ability of classifiers to recognize both classes. The proposed approach was validated and compared using synthetic data and videos from the Faces In Action, and COX dataset that emulate face re-identification applications. Results show that PBoost outperforms state of the art techniques in terms of both accuracy and complexity over different levels of imbalance and overlap between classes.

AB Metalloprotease PT121(Y114S), an effective catalyst for Z-aspartame synthesis under the substrate (Z-Asp:L-Phe-OMe) molar ratio of 1: 5, was obtained previously. Herein, a computational strategy combining molecular dynamics simulation of the enzyme-substrate complex with binding free energy (Delta G) calculations was established to guide the further engineering of PT121(Y114S). One His224 residue proximal to the PT121(Y114S) active site was selected on the basis of the difference in Delta G decomposition of PT121(Y114S) toward L-Phe-NH2 and L-Phe-OMe. Site-saturation mutagenesis of His224 resulted in the mutants H224D, H224N, and H224S, which showed great improvement in Z-aspartame synthesis under an economical substrate molar ratio approaching 1:1. Furthermore, the kinetic constants of PT121(Y114S) and its mutants revealed that the affinity of mutants toward the L-Phe-OMe was significantly higher than that of PT121(Y114S). Molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the enhanced synthetic activity may be attributed to the mutation stabilizing the transient state of the enzyme-L-Phe-OMe complex.

AB In order to examine the residues of thiacloprid (90 and 180 ga.i./ha) and deltamethrin (10 and 20 ga.i./ha) in fresh tea leaves, made tea and tea infusion, field experiments were conducted at three different locations viz. Kamalpur tea estate, Darjeeling; West Bengal, Teok tea Estate and AAU, Jorhat; Assam in India. Regardless of location and doses, residues of both the insecticides dissipated following first order kinetics. The half-life of Thiacloprid (4.93-5.38 days) was longer than that of deltamethrin (1.78-1.94 days). Processing of green tea leaves reduced the residue level of thiacloprid and deltamethrin in made tea. No residues of both these insecticides could be detected in tea infusion. With respect to the phenolic distribution in tea, a marked increase in total catechin monomers with thiacloprid and greater accumulation of EGCG and ECG (indices of phenol quality) with deltamethrin were observed.

The objective of this work was to optimise a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for analysis of avenanthramides in food, and analyse the avenanthramide content in 45 oat fractions and products. The optimised HPLC method was based on triplicate extraction of 100 mg sample with 1 ml 80% ethanol in phosphate buffer (pH 2.8) and used gallacetophenone as an internal standard. Avenalumic acid-derived avenanthramide homologues 2f(d) and 2p(d) were also present, making up to 20% of the total avenanthramides detected in oats. The amounts of avenanthramides detected in oat products was 2-82 mu g/g. It was estimated that mean avenanthramide intake among oat consumers ranges from 0.3 to 2.1 mg/day, considerably lower than the amount used in studies that have investigated biological effects of avenanthramides in humans.

AB Spent hens have low market value and incur significant costs for disposal. This study explored the use of spent hens as a source of bioactive peptides. Spent hen hydrolysates prepared by Protease M or Protex 50FP exhibited interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitory activity in endotoxin-activated macrophage-like U937 cells (p<.05). The potential peptides from Protex 50FP hydrolysate were further fractionated using a combination of ultrafiltration, solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography; 17 novel peptides encoded in major muscle proteins were identified by mass spectrometry analysis, of which 7 were chemically synthesized and assayed for the IL-6 inhibitory activity. At a concentration of 100 mu g/mL, peptide FLWGKSY induced a 79% reduction of IL-6 production in endotoxin-activated macrophage-like U937 cells, which is comparable to results reported from other food sources. Our results indicate that spent hens have potential to be a source of bioactive peptides for anti-inflammatory applications.

AB Adlay bran free phenolic extract has been previously demonstrated to possess potent xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibitory activity. The aims of this study were to characterize the free phenolic profile of adlay bran and investigate the structure-activity relationship, underlying mechanism and interaction of phenolic acids as XOD inhibitors. A total of twenty phenolics including ten phenolic acids, two coumarins, two phenolic aldedhyes and six flavonoids were identified in a phenolic compound-guided separation by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Adlay bran free phenolic extract possessed strong XOD inhibitory activity related to hydroxycinnamic acids with methoxyl groups. The hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were the main forces in the binding of adlay phenolics to XOD. Sinapic acid, identified in adlay bran for the first time, possessed strong XOD inhibitory activity in a mixed non-competitive manner, and synergistic effects with other adlay phenolic acids at low concentrations, and would be a promising agent for preventing and treating hyperuricemia.

AB Gluten-free breads were developed from rice flour and corn starch at a constant ratio 1: 1 with acorn meal addition (5, 15, 25%), at three levels of water (65, 70, 75%). Acorn supplemented gluten free breads better met sensory preference than rice breads in terms of colour (brown hue was enhanced) and were also nutritionally improved in terms of total phenolics. The specific volume of breads significantly decreased with increasing acorn addition while crumb hardness was also increased. SEM images confirmed that the decrease in the.H values at low water level (65%) was due to less swelling of starch as observed from large starch granule remnants present after baking. XRD measurements revealed coexistence of "B" and "V" type starch structures. Increasing of acorn concentration enhanced the intensity of FTIR bands at 994, 1016 and 1077 cm(-1).

AB Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models appear to be an ideal tool for quick screening of promising candidates from a vast library of molecules, which can then be further designed, synthesized and tested using a combination of rigorous first principle simulations, such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and experiments. In this study, QSAR models have been built with an extensive dataset of 487 compounds to predict the sweetness potency relative to sucrose (ranging 0.2-220,000). The whole dataset was randomly split into training and test sets in a 70: 30 ratio. The models were developed using Genetic Function Approximation (R-test(2)=0.832) and Artificial Neural Network (R-test(2)= 0.831). Our models thus offer a convenient route for fast screening of molecules prior to synthesis and testing. Additionally, this study can supplement a molecular modelling approach to improve binding of molecules with sweet taste receptors, leading to design of novel sweeteners.

AB Glutenin and gliadin were treated with protein-glutaminase in order to obtain soluble glutenin (PG-Glu) and gliadin (PG-Gli). PG-Glu or PG-Gli was added to potato starch at various concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% of starch weight, w/w), and the physicochemical properties and microstructure of starch/protein mixtures were investigated. The results showed that the presence of PG-Glu or PG-Gli decreased the viscosity parameters and yield stress and consistency coefficient of mixed pastes. The starch/protein mixed pastes exhibited a pseudoplastic and shear-thinning behavior under yield stress condition, and the storage modulus and loss modulus increased. Moreover, the T-o, T-p, T-c, and.H of starch/protein mixtures varied insignificantly compared with native starch. CLSM results confirmed the inhibition of PG-Glu and PG-Gli on the gelatinization of starch, and the morphology of starch granules became more compact. These results suggest that the physicochemical properties and microstructure of potato starch are effectively influenced by PG-Glu or PG-Gli.

AB The purpose of the work was to determine which processes occur during fermentation of rye dough beside progressive hydrolysis of biopolymers and production of gases, and also to determine which compounds are most responsible for them. The study was conducted with a specially modified dough containing starch, arabinoxylan preparations (non-modified, hydrolysed and cross-linked) and protein obtained from rye wholemeal.
   Despite the same consistency of the dough samples, their viscosity and values of rheological parameters depended on the amount of arabinoxylan preparations and their molecular weight. Already at the stage of mixing the dough, high molecular complexes of arabinoxylan-protein and arabinoxylan-arabinoxylan were formed. Complex formation was confirmed in the modified dough preparation with rye starch including only arabinoxylan or rye protein as well as a combination of arabinoxylan and rye protein. The highest amount and molecular dimension of complexes were found in the sample composed of starch, cross-linked arabinoxylan and rye protein.

AB Grape marc distillates are traditional alcoholic beverages, produced mostly in the Mediterranean countries. The present study proposes the enrichment of a Greek traditional grape marc distillate (tsikoudia) with selected herbs to enhance its natural antioxidants and functional properties. Total phenolic content, the antiradical and antioxidant activities, as well as the phenolic and sugar profiles using NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy were evaluated. The enrichment of distillates with Syzygium aromaticum L., Jasminum officinale L. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill. exhibited the highest total phenolic content as well as the highest antioxidant and antiradical activities, whereas the lowest values were observed with Hippophae rhamnoides L. and Lycium Barbarum Mill. The implementation of NMR and FT-IR spectroscopies attested to the presence of phenolic compounds and of specific carbohydrates in herbal distillates, postulating their migration from selected herbal species to tsikoudia and probably contributing to their organoleptic characteristics. The target of this approach leads to new added-value distillates with enhanced characteristics.

AB Pectinase was immobilized onto sodium alginate/graphene oxide beads via amide bonds by using N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/ N-hydroxysuccinimide as the activating agent. The immobilized pectinase was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Immobilization conditions were optimized by Box-Behnken design and the response surface method. The activity of the immobilized pectinase prepared under optimal conditions reached 1236.86 +/- 40.21 U/g, with an enzyme activity recovery of 83.5%. The optimal pH of free pectinase was 4.5, while that of immobilized pectinase was shifted to 4.0. The optimal temperature of immobilized pectinase was increased to 60 degrees C, which was 10 degrees C higher than that of free form. Furthermore, the immobilized pectinase possessed a superior thermal stability and storage stability to those of free pectinase. Reusability studies indicated that the immobilized pectinase retained 73% of initial activity after six times cycles. Due to these good properties, such immobilized pectinase may find application in food industry.

AB Although immobilized trypsin is a viable alternative to the free one in solution for producing protein hydrolysates, the change of selectivity introduced by immobilization is unclear. In this study, we compared the selectivity of free and immobilized trypsin towards different cleavage sites of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) with a focus on the impact of environmental pH. Both free and immobilized trypsin exhibited greater accessibility to native beta-Lg at elevated pH (from pH 7.2 to 8.7). Additionally, free trypsin preferred to attack cleavage sites located at the C-terminus at pH 7.8, whereas an opposite preference for the N-terminus was observed at pH 8.7. Regarding the immobilized trypsin, the pH did not significantly influence its preference for the C-or N-terminus. Generally, immobilization of trypsin resulted in more focused cleavage within its specificity during the initial stage of hydrolysis, and some peptides were formed more rapidly by the immobilized trypsin.

AB Thirty-one canthin-6-one analogues, mainly including C-2 or C-5 or D ring modified canthin-6-ones, were designed and synthesized in order to study their antibacterial activity and structure-activity relationships. The analogue 28 with the highest bioactivity had a peak minimum inhibitory concentration of 4 mu g/ml and showed low cytotoxicity against L02 cells and good "drug-like" properties. The antibacterial effect of 28 was characterized further by scanning electron microscopy, cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase leakage assay, molecular docking evaluation, UV-visible analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurement. The results showed that 28 may exert its bactericidal effect by damaging bacterial cell membranes and disrupting the function of DNA topoisomerases, both of which could lead to rapid cell death.

AB This study evaluates the impact on two varietal white wines from 'Chardonnay' and 'Verdejo' cultivars of different fermentative strategies: inoculation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast (CT), sequential inoculation (Torulaspora delbrueckii/Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SI), and spontaneous fermentation (SP). The wines' chemical composition was characterized by oenological parameters, organic acids, metals, major volatile compounds, ester compounds and sensory analyses. The fermentative strategy (CT, SI and SP) was found to be a key factor for assessing different styles of white wines. SI wines showed enhanced 'mature fruit' nuances and a chemical profile characterized by higher content of ethyl propanoate, ethyl isobutyrate and ethyl dihydrocinnamate. Meanwhile, the SP wines presented enhanced "stone fruit" nuances possible related to the higher contents of 2-phenyl acetate and isobutyl acetate. After a chemometric approach the above esters were identified as the markers of each fermentative strategy, independently of the variety.

AB Ketocarotenoids are high-value natural pigments. The red diketocarotenoid astaxanthin particularly exhibits an extraordinary antioxidant activity, which raises its market demand for foods and nutraceuticals. We screened for ketocarotenoid-producing bacteria from both marine and freshwater environments. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, revealed 37 potential producers of ketocarotenoids that are related to alpha-proteobacteria, comprising 32 strains of Brevundimonas and 5 strains of Erythrobacter. Carotenoids analysis by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS revealed two groups; astaxanthin-producers (28 Brevundimonas strains) and adonixanthin-producers (Five Brevundimonas and 5 Erythrobacter strains). Strain FrW-Asx16 exhibited the highest carotenoid production (1060 mu g g(-1) dry cells with 16.6% astaxanthin). Strain FrW-Asx-5 producing 946.1 mu g g(-1) dry cells carotenoid exhibited the highest astaxanthin content (similar to 46%). The most intriguing result is the potential of producing natural colorants from freshwater bacterial isolates, and with high productivity and selectivity, suggesting a great promise for their application in food.

AB The effect of puroindolines (PINs) on structural characteristics of wheat proteins was investigated in Triticum turgidum ssp. durum (cv. Svevo) and Triticum aestivum (cv. Alpowa) and in their respective derivatives in which PIN genes were expressed (Soft Svevo) or the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5D was deleted and PINs were not expressed (Hard Alpowa). The presence of PINs decreased the amount of cold-SDS extractable proteins and the accessibility of protein thiols to specific reagents, but resulted in facilitated solvation of gluten proteins, as detected by tryptophan fluorescence measurements carried out on minimally mixed flour/water mixtures. We propose that PINs and gluten proteins are interacting in the grain or flour prior to mixing. Hydrophobic interactions between PINs and some of the gluten proteins modify the pattern of interactions among gluten proteins, thus providing an additional mechanistic rationale for the effects of PINs on kernel hardness.

ID WHEAT BRAN; PARTICLE-SIZE; LOAF VOLUME; GLUTEN; IMPACT
AB This study investigates the effect of the physical presence and water binding of wheat bran during bread making, and the possible mechanisms behind this effect. Regular bran, pericarp-enriched bran and synthetic bran-like particles with different water binding capacities and particle sizes were used. Incorporation of regular and pericarp-enriched bran in dough (15% dm) led to a lower oven rise than the control dough. Bread volumes decreased with 11% and 30%, respectively. Dough with synthetic bran, having a low water binding capacity, displayed a near to normal leavening and oven rise and resulted in a bread volume decrease of only 5% compared to the control. Particle size reduction of regular bran and synthetic bran to an average size of 200 mu m did not affect final bread quality. Results indicate that water binding by bran affects bread quality the most, whereas steric hindrance by physical presence of bran particles is less determinative.

AB Immature rice grain is one of the underutilized by-products of paddy milling process. Despite its high potential of use as a food ingredient, it is mainly utilized as feed due to the rancidity problem. In the present study, the composition of immature rice grain, the potential of using infrared (IR) radiation for stabilization, and the effects of IR stabilization on color, fatty acid composition, tocopherol and gamma-oryzanol contents of the grain were investigated. The free fatty acid (FFA) value of the unprocessed immature rice grain was 5.49% and increased to 35.71% at the end of 3 months of storage at room temperature. However, FFA content of the grains stabilized with IR radiation at specific conditions remained unchanged throughout the storage period. Moreover, IR stabilization did not caused a negative effect on the noted components of the immature rice grain.

AB In the present study, an integrated approach combining HPLC/DAD, GC/MS, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, and chemometrics was used to geographically discriminate saffron samples from Iran and China. Chinese and Iranian samples can be well-separated based on HPLC data analysed by a principal component analysis and an orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. Picrocrocin and two types of crocins were found to be the discriminating variables, and the Chinese samples had higher contents of safranal and picrocrocin but lower cis-crocin 3Gg, kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside and isophorone. Furthermore, an NIR method was successfully established to rapidly distinguish the Chinese and Iranian samples. The relationship between an ISO standard and the contents of the chemical indices was also studied. The results indicated that the ISO standard should be revised, especially for analysing safranal.

AB The influence of polyol type and particle size on the flavor release profile of chewing gum was investigated in vivo. Four chewing gum samples with an average particle size of 62 or 246 mu m for sorbitol and 57 or 184 mu m for mannitol were analyzed. Chewing gum formulated with mannitol, in general, had a higher aroma release than chewing gum formulated with sorbitol. Polyol type did not influence the release profile of the high intensity sweeteners (HIS) aspartame and acesulfame K. However, a smaller particle size resulted in a significantly higher release of HIS. The release rate of polyol was not significantly changed by particle size. Sensory analysis was also in agreement with the HIS delivery; the smaller particle size polyol gum was significantly higher in perceived sweetness intensity. In summary, two physical attributes of polyols (solubility and surface area) were reported to uniquely alter the delivery of aroma and taste stimuli.

AB An alternative approach using visible chemical waves for ethanol determination is presented. The method is based on the dynamic change of chemical waves in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction by perturbation with ethanol. The observablepropagating waves, generatedina Petri dish, can be recorded by using a smartphone camera. The propagating distances are measured from photographic images and then plotted as a function of time to attain the wave velocity. It is found that wave velocities are inversely proportional to ethanol concentrations. By using this linear relationship, the ethanol content can be efficiently quantified with good intraday and inter-day precision (<3% RSD). Validated by the GC technique, the developed method is highly reliable and successfully applied for quantifying the ethanol content in beer, colored whisky, and vodka samples. Hence, this new method provides an alternative practical strategy for simple quantitative detection of ethanol without the need for instruments.

AB To gain better understanding on laccase in apples and reveal its role in browning color formation during storage, laccases in apples were investigated. The full-length complementary DNAs encoding laccase genes were obtained from different tissues of apple including flowers, calyx, leaves and fruit peel of 'Red Delicious' and 'Cortland'. The apple laccases were compared to those in other plant species and found to have up to 99% homology to Arabidopsis and litchi. qRT-PCR analysis revealed changes in transcript abundance of LAC genes (2, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15 and 16) during storage and in response to DPA and 1-MCP treatments. Enzyme activity of laccase protein in apple peel increased with storage in control fruit, while decreased significantly with DPA or 1-MCP. Changes in phenolic compounds in pericarp tissues decreased generally during storage, but no significant effect of DPA and 1-MCP treatments on the phenolic compounds was found.

AB Bioavailability of food nutrients can be reduced in the presence of antinutrients such as phytates and tannins. This work aimed to study bovine serum albumin binding to phytic acid and tannic acid, and its influence on in vitro protein digestibility. The effect of autoclaving and boiling on protein digestibility and the microstructure of complexes was also evaluated. Results showed that high ionic strength promotes greater affinity between tannic acid and bovine serum albumin, and decreases in vitro protein digestibility. For phytic acid and bovine serum albumin, the opposite behavior is observed because interactions are governed by electrostatic forces. A rise in temperature above that causing denaturation of the protein favors its interaction with phytic acid, and disfavors that with tannic acid, probably due to different protein binding site exposure. For both antinutrients, heating treatment increased protein hydrolysis, the size of complexes and their fragility.

AB Salts reduction/substitution have gained a lot interest from food industry since the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a draft guidance for salt reduction. However how changes of salts in food formulation could influence lipid oxidation is still not fully understood. Using oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by a natural emulsifier - lecithin at pH 7.0 as a model system, this study evaluated how salts affect the physical parameters of the emulsion, the chelating activity of lecithin and thus the lipid oxidation of these emulsions. Results showed that salts increased the particle size, the negative charge of the oil droplets, and the amount of iron chelated by lecithin. Lipid oxidation lag phases were shortened by addition of salts, by 1 day and 2 days for lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances measurements respectively. These results provide some new insights on the mechanisms of how salts could affect the lipid oxidation of food emulsions.

AB This study was aimed to determine the effect of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) on mu-calpain activity at different Ca2+ concentrations. mu-Calpain was treated with AP or PKA at 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 1mM Ca2+. The pH value decreased in the AP group but remained stable in the control and PKA groups during incubation. Except samples incubated at 0.01 and 0.1mM Ca2+ for more than 20 min, mu-calpain incubated with PKA showed a higher degree of autolysis than control, but lower than the AP group. The content of a-helix structure of mu-calpain increased as phosphorylation level rose. Phosphorylation of mu-calpain at serine 255, 256, 476, 417 and 420 was identified. PKA catalyzed mu-calpain phosphorylation at serine 255, 256 and 476, located at domains II and III, positively regulated mu-calpain activity. These data demonstrated that dephosphorylation and PKA phosphorylation positively regulated mu-calpain activity, which was limited by increased Ca2+ concentration.

AB A chromatographic method involving a single run was validated for the quantification of clanobutin, dichlorvos, and naftazone in products of animal origin. Pork, beef, chicken, milk, and egg samples were extracted with a solution of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, defatted with n-hexane, centrifuged, and filtered prior to analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-/MS/MS). The analytes were separated on a C18 column using a solution of 0.1% formic acid and 10mM ammonium formate (A) and acetonitrile (B) as the mobile phase. A good linearity over 5-50 ng/g concentration range was obtained with coefficients of determination (R-2) >= 0.9807. The intra-and interday accuracy (recovery %) calculated from 3 fortification levels (5, 10, and 20 ng/g) were 73.2-108.1% and 71.4-109.8%, and the precisions (expressed relative standard deviations (RSDs)) were 0.9-12.9% and 1.8-10.6%, respectively, for the 3 tested analytes in animal originated foods. The limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged between 0.1 and 1 ng/g, thus enabling the quantification of residual levels below the uniform maximum residue limit (MRL) of 0.01 mg/kg set for compounds having no MRL. The designated methodology was successfully applied to monitor various samples collected from Seoul; the tested analytes were not quantified in any of the market samples. Conclusively, the developed method is simple, sensitive, and accurate, and could be used for the detection of pharmaceuticals in various animal food matrices with variable protein and fat contents.

AB This study developed, optimized and validated an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) method to identify and quantify metabolites and microbial-derived catabolites in urine, plasma and feces of rats following ingestion of 50 mg of a red wine proanthocyanidin-rich extract. The method was validated for specificity, linearity, limit of detection (LD) and quantification (LQ), intra-day and inter-day precision, recovery and matrix effects, which were determined for 34 compounds in the three biological matrices. After method validation, three parent flavan-3-ols, four 5-carbon side chain ring fission metabolites, and 27 phenolic acid and aromatic catabolites were quantified in plasma, urine and feces after red wine proanthocyanidin intake. These results establish the value of the UHPLC-HRMS protocol in obtaining a detailed picture of proanthocyanidin metabolites and their microbial-derived catabolites, along with their phase II metabolites, in biological fluids of rat, and potentially in human clinical studies designed to evaluate the bioavailability of dietary flavan-3-ols.

AB Four selected vegetable amaranths were grown under four soil water content to evaluate their response in nutrients, minerals, antioxidant leaf pigments, vitamins, polyphenol, flavonoid and total antioxidant activity (TAC). Vegetable amaranth was significantly affected by variety, soil water content and variety x soil water content interactions for all the traits studied. Increase in water stress, resulted in significant changes in proximate compositions, minerals (macro and micro), leaf pigments, vitamin, total polyphenol content (TPC), and total flavonoid content (TFC) of vegetable amaranth. Accessions VA14 and VA16 performed better for all the traits studied. Correlation study revealed a strong antioxidant scavenging activity of leaf pigments, ascorbic acid, TPC and TFC. Vegetable amaranth can tolerate soil water stress without compromising the high quality of the final product in terms of nutrients and antioxidant profiles. Therefore, it could be a promising alternative crop in semi-arid and dry areas and also during dry seasons.

AB In this paper, the influence of lactoferrin (LF) on the structural development of whey protein isolate (WPI) gels during heating was investigated. The results demonstrated that the presence of sufficient LF could improve the strength and elasticity of WPI gels. When 30% LF was added, the elastic modulus of WPI gels increased from 254 +/- 31 and 413 +/- 58 Pa to 3222 +/- 105 and 2730 +/- 131 Pa at pH 6.7 and 5.8, respectively. The addition of LF improved the water holding capacity (WHC) of WPI gels at pH 6.7, while no improvement was observed at pH 5.8. LF interacted with whey proteins differently at pH 6.7 and 5.8 during heating. The LF/whey proteins complexes formed at pH 6.7 had smaller sizes and narrower size distributions than those formed at pH 5.8.

AB Ultrasound treatment could change the conformation of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) and improve the glycation reaction in aqueous solution under neutral condition. However, the effect of ultrasound pretreatment on glycation of beta-Lg with pentose at dry-state remains ambiguous, and the relationship between glycation and allergenicity of beta-Lg with ultrasound pretreatment is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ultrasound pretreatment on glycation and allergenicity of beta-Lg. Markedly decreased allergenicity of beta-Lg was observed after glycation with ribose before and after ultrasound pretreatment with the minimum found at 400 W. Orbitrap LC-MS/ MS showed that the glycation degree of some peptides in glycated beta-Lg with and without ultrasound pretreatment were different although the content of free amino group and molecular mass were insignificantly different. Therefore, ultrasound pretreatment promoted the reduction in allergenicity by improving the glycation extent of some glycation sites although it hardly enhanced the whole glycation degree of beta-Lg.

AB Starch-lipid complexes were prepared using lotus seed starch (LS) and glycerin monostearate (GMS) via a high-pressure homogenization process, and the effect of high pressure homogenization (HPH) on the slow digestion properties of LS-GMS was investigated. The digestion profiles showed HPH treatment reduced the digestive rate of LS-GMS, and the extent of this change was dependent on homogenized pressure. Scanning electron microscopy displayed HPH treatment change the morphology of LS-GMS, with high pressure producing more compact block-shape structure to resist enzyme digestion. The results of Gel-permeation chromatography and Small-angle X-ray scattering revealed high homogenization pressure impacted molecular weight distribution and semicrystalline region of complexes, resulting in the formation of new semi-crystalline with repeat unit distance of 16-18 nm and molecular weight distribution of 2.50-2.80x10(5) Da, which displayed strong enzymatic resistance. Differential scanning calorimeter results revealed new semi-crystalline lamellar may originate from type-II complexes that exhibited a high transition temperature.

AB Egg white proteins (EWPs) are important components of many food products. To obtain optimal functionality, EWP aggregation needs to be controlled. Different treatments can lead to the formation of aggregates in diverse ways, depending on the parameters of the treatments. Recent articles on the effects of processing (heat treatment, alkali treatment, pulsed electric field, high pressure, ultraviolet irradiation, and high intensity ultrasound) on the aggregation of EWPs are reviewed. The relationships between the processing parameters and the aggregation mechanisms are discussed. The information may be helpful in controlling the aggregation mechanisms during the processing.

AB The effects of Kadozan (a novel chitosan formulation) treatment on physiological attribute, nutritional quality and storage behavior of harvested "Wuye" litchi fruit were studied. Compared with control litchis, Kadozan treatment significantly decreased fruit respiration rate, retarded the increase of pericarp cell membrane permeability, maintained higher contents of anthocyanins and flavonoids and higher values of L*, a* and b* in litchi pericarp, and reduced the decreases of titratable acidity, total soluble solids, total soluble sugars, and vitamin C contents in litchi pulp, maintaining better quality of litchis. Furthermore, Kadozan treatment decreased browning index and disease index of litchis, kept higher rate of commercially acceptable fruit, and reduced fruit weight loss, showing better storage behavior of litchis under ambient temperature. The optimal Kadozan treatment for litchis was the 1: 100 (V-Kadozan:VKadozan+Water) dilution, which might be a promising method for keeping quality and prolonging shelf-life of harvested "Wuye" litchi fruit.

AB Triacylglycerol (TAG) composition in 180 commercial infant, follow-on and growing-up formulas with different fat sources (plant oil, cow's milk and goat's milk) were analyzed and compared with mature human milk (MHM). TAGs in formulas were greatly affected by fat source. Formulas contained higher proportions of TAGs with short-chain/medium-chain saturated fatty acids, OOO and acyl carbon number (ACN) 54, and lower proportions of ACN 52 than MHM. There were significant differences in the content and stereochemical structure of OPL and OPO between formulas and MHM. Although there were no significant differences in the OPO contents between formulas with OPO and MHM, it is not enough to reach the abundance of palmitic acid (PA) at the sn-2 position in MHM. These results indicated that it is more suitable for Chinese infants to supplement the formulas with not only OPO, but also other TAGs containing PA mainly at the sn-2 position (such as OPL).

AB The contribution of the emulsion rheological properties and the viscoelastic of the interface adsorbed layer to the emulsification mechanism of ovalbumin (OVA)-chitosan (CS) mixtures were investigated. In comparison to the treatment with OVA alone and OVA/CS mixtures at pH 4.0, the addition of CS at pH 5.5 increased the size distribution of emulsion droplets with significant flocculation through polyelectrolyte bridging, remarkably enhancing the emulsions stability against gravity creaming after storage at 25 degrees C for 14 days. The dynamic rheological properties indicated that the formation of the complex at pH 5.5 increased the elastic modulus (G') and apparent viscosity (eta*) of the emulsions, which is useful for inhibiting creaming. Moreover, the complexation of OVA and CS at pH 5.5 increased the dilatational modulus (E), especially the elastic modulus (E-d), of the oil/water interfacial absorbed layer, which could reduce the droplet coalescence and therefore inhibit the growth of emulsion droplets.

AB FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine changes in secondary structure, as well as water state, in gluten and model doughs supplemented by four fibre polysaccharides (microcrystalline cellulose, inulin, apple pectin and citrus pectin). The gluten and model doughs were obtained from commercially available wheat gluten and model flour, respectively. The polysaccharides were used in five concentrations: 3%, 6%, 9%, 12% and 18%. Analysis of the FTIR spectra indicated that polysaccharides could be divided into two groups: first - microcrystalline cellulose and inulin, second - apple and citrus pectins that induced opposite structural changes. Changes in secondary structure concern mainly beta-sheets and beta-turns that form aggregated beta-structures, suggesting dehydration of the gluten matrix as a result of competition for water between gluten proteins and polysaccharides. Moreover, the positive band at ca. 1226 cm(-1) in the spectra of pectin-modified samples indicates formation of 'ether' type hydrogen bonds between gluten proteins and pectins.

AB Nuts and dried fruits contain rich nutrients and are thus highly vulnerable to contamination with toxigenic fungi and aflatoxins because of poor weather, processing and storage conditions. Imaging and spectroscopic techniques have proven to be potential alternative tools to wet chemistry methods for efficient and non-destructive determination of contamination with fungi and toxins. Thus, this review provides an overview of the current developments and applications in frequently used food safety testing techniques, including near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS), conventional imaging techniques (colour imaging (CI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI)), and fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging (FS/FI). Interesting classification and determination results can be found in both static and on/in-line real-time detection for contaminated nuts and dried fruits. Although these techniques offer many benefits over conventional methods, challenges remain in terms of heterogeneous distribution of toxins, background constituent interference, model robustness, detection limits, sorting efficiency, as well as instrument development.

AB The biochemical properties of buckwheat honey, including contents of sugars, proteins, total phenols, methylglyoxal (MGO), minerals and phenolic compounds, were determined in comparison with those of manuka honey. Buckwheat honey has higher contents of sugars, proteins and total phenols but a lower content of MGO than manuka honey. Buckwheat honey contains abundant minerals involved in a number of vital functions of the human body as does manuka honey, and has even higher contents of Fe, Mn and Zn. In buckwheat honey, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid are the dominant phenolic compounds. Moreover, the antibacterial and cellular antioxidant activities of buckwheat honey were compared with those of manuka honey. Buckwheat honey exhibits antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, comparable with manuka honey, and the cellular antioxidant activity of buckwheat honey is higher than that of manuka honey. Our results suggest that buckwheat honey has great nutritional and commercial potentials.

AB The effect of controlled deficit irrigation (CDI) on the accumulation of carotenoids, polyphenols and L-ascorbic acid was studied in conventional and high lycopene tomato cultivars. Plants were initially irrigated to cover 100% ETc and after the fruit set phase, the dose was reduced to 75% or 50% of ETc. CDI had no significant effect on the accumulation of carotenoids, while it increased the levels of the hydroxycinnamic acids chlorogenic and ferulic acids, the flavonoid rutin and L-ascorbic acid. Nevertheless, there were important interactions and this effect was highly dependent on the year and site of cultivation. Certain growing areas would be more favorable to supply high quality markets, and, fortunately, CDI would maximize polyphenol (100-75% ETc) and L-ascorbic acid (100-50% ETc) in these areas. A combination of the best genotype and growing area with CDI would offer high quality products, preserving a scarce resource: water.

AB In an effort to control weight gain, much attention has focused on the identification of bioactive peptides from food sources that induce satiety hormone secretion and increase the feeling of fullness. In this study, a screening platform identified a sodium caseinate hydrolysate, LFC25, that significantly increased calcium signalling in the enteroendocrine cell line, STC-1, and as a result increased secretion of the satiety hormone, GLP-1, in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of this hydrolysate to mice reduced the cumulative food intake over an eight hour period. To determine the feasibility of LFC25 as a food ingredient, production was scaled up to 10 L and spray-dried or freeze-dried without loss of bioactivity.

AB Lowering of greening formed from oxidized chlorogenic acid (CGA) and amino groups, and favoured at alkaline pH, was investigated using acidic ingredients (sour cream, buttermilk, yoghurt, and honey) in sunflower butter cookies. Cookies with maple syrup added were used as a positive control. Changes in greening intensity, greening reactants (total phenols, CGA, protein), antioxidant capacity, tryptophan and Schiff base fluorescence were measured. Percentage greening, pH and a(w) of cookies followed the same order: maple syrup > sour cream=buttermilk > yoghurt > honey. pH was positively correlated with greening intensity (r=0.77) and negatively correlated with CGA (r=-0.96). Total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, tryptophan and Schiff bases were similar among cookies. The results suggest it is possible to decrease greening by minimizing storage time and using acidic ingredients. Minimal greening with acidic ingredients can extend the application of sunflower butter as a baking ingredient without loss of free radical-scavenging capacity, or higher protein oxidation.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of MIR and texture analyzer to evaluate the quality of pound cake samples produced with palm oil and rapeseed oil throughout storage. The MIR spectra analyzed by using principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear separation of pound cakes as a function of the storage time and the nature of the used oil in the recipe. By applying partial least square regression (PLSR), excellent prediction was obtained for hardness (R-2=0.91; RPD=2.26), while an approximate qualitative prediction was found for springiness (R-2= 0.73; RPD=2.07), cohesiveness (R-2=0.67; RPD=1.31) and resilience (R-2= 0.65; RPD=1.24). It could be concluded that the MIR spectroscopy could be used as a rapid and non-destructive technique for monitoring texture of pound cakes throughout storage as well as for the prediction of their hardness.

DE Brassica juncea; Condiment; Cultivar; Isothiocyanate; Sinigrin
ID ISOTHIOCYANATES; QUANTIFICATION; SEPARATION
AB Brassica juncea mustard seed are used to make mustard paste or condiment. Mustard seed contains glucosinolates which are converted to isothiocyanates following cell disruption by the enzyme, myrosinase. Isothiocyanates are sulphur-containing compounds which give a pungent flavour to the mustard condiment. Three mustard seed cultivars from two seasons were processed into Dijon- and wholegrain-style mustard and glucosinolates and isothiocyanates analysed. Canadian cv. Centennial tended to contain higher glucosinolates compared with the French cv. AZ147 and Ukrainian cv. Chorniava. Conversion of the mustard seed into a wholegrain condiment had a lesser effect on total isothiocyanates and sinigrin content compared with the Dijon-style preparation. The Canadian mustard cultivars produced wholegrain-style mustard with higher total isothyocyantes and sinigrin compared with the French and Ukrainian cultivars. In summary, results herein suggest that Canadian mustard seed cvs. Centennial and Forge, and wholegrain processing may result in a condiment with greater bioactive composition.

AB In studies of secondary metabolites in nuts, many constituents in the kernel remain unidentified due to a high content of phenolic compounds in the pellicle. In the present study, we focused on the investigation of the phenolic and dicarboxylic acid profiles of walnut and hazelnut pellicle-less kernels. High-performance liquid chromatography with diode array and mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-DAD-MSn) was used to carry out the determination of individual phenolics and dicarboxylic acids in brown and red-pellicle walnut and hazelnut. Results show that hexahydroxydiphenic acid (HHDP) di-galloyl hexose isomer, vanillic acid hexoside, quinic acid derivative and catechin are the main constituents of the phenolic profile of walnut, while galloylquinic derivative, caffeoyl hexoside and catechin are the main constituents of the hazelnut kernel. Even though both walnut and hazelnut kernels have a considerably lower content of phenolic compounds and dicarboxylic acids in comparison to the pellicles, when calculated as a percentage of the total mass, the kernel makes a significant contribution to the total phenolic content of the whole nut.

AB An interlaboratory comparison (ILC) was organized as a measure of the analytical competency in the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification of okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1) in scallop midgut gland samples. The test sample was prepared using boiled midgut glands of naturally contaminated scallops with DTX1 and its esters by spiking with OA, and homogeneity and stability of this test sample was assessed to be appropriate. Twenty laboratories participated in the ILC based on the Japanese official testing method; they submitted two sets of analytical concentrations of target analytes along with the details of their analytical protocols. For assessing these data, assigned values were established from another ILC where ten participants quantified the target analytes by the standard addition method. The mean analytical results of the former ILC showed good agreement with the assigned values, and the corresponding relative reproducibility standard deviations met the criterion of CODEX STAN 292. Meanwhile, the results of more than half of the participants were out of the uncertainty range of the assigned values; these participants were encouraged to investigate their protocols to improve their analytical capability.

AB We developed new loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based detection methods for the screening of genetically modified (GM) maize and soybean events. The LAMP methods developed targeted seven sequences: cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter; 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain CP4 (cp4epsps); phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (pat) gene; mannose-6-phosphate isomerase gene; Pisum sativum ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase terminator; a common sequence between Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac genes; and a GA21 construct-specific sequence. We designed new specific primer sets for each target, and the limit of detection (LOD) was evaluated using authorized GM maize and soybean events. LODs for each target were <= 0.5%. To make the DNA extraction process simple and rapid, we also developed a direct LAMP detection scheme using crude cell lysates. The entire process, including pretreatments and detection, could be completed within 1 h.

   STATISTICS; EXPRESSION
AB PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) that controls cell fate by regulating multiple signal transduction pathways and is found to be overexpressed in a variety of malignant tumors. Herein, we found the expression of PIN1 is up-regulated while miRNA-370 (miR-370) down-regulated in both esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and cells. Transfection of miR-370 can significantly decrease PIN1 expression in targeting ESCC cells. Overexpression of miR-370 can induce decreased cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest, as well as increased apoptosis in ESCC cells, while this function can be significantly prevented by co-transfection of PIN1. Further experimental results demonstrated that beta-catenin, cyclin D1, and caspase activation might be involved in miR-370/PIN1 induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Besides, low miR-370 and high PIN1 expression significantly correlated with tumor diameter, poor differentiation, tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis in patients diagnosed with ESCC. In conclusion, downregulation of miR-370 in ESCC is associated with cancer progression and promotes cancer cell proliferation via upregulating PIN1, which might be a potential therapeutic target and adverse prognostic factor in the clinic.

AB Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate the association between the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1)/cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)/mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene polymorphisms and the post-caesarean analgesic effect of fentanyl on Chinese women.
   Methods: We recruited 240 patients who received lower segment caesarean section surgeries. Sanger sequencing was used to analyze the MDR(1)1236C > T/CYP3A4*1G/OPRM(1)A118G polymorphisms. We evaluated post-operative fentanyl consumption and the effect of intravenous analgesia in patients with different genotypes.
   Results: 1. Subjects with the TT genotype at the 1236C > T polymorphism in the MORI gene consumed significantly more fentanyl than that consumed by subjects with the CC and CT genotypes in the first post-operative 24 h and 48 h (P < 0.05), and the MAP/HR/Cor/Ang-1 levels gradually increased immediately after surgery and in the first post-operative 24 h. 2. Subjects with the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype needed less fentanyl to achieve pain control than that needed by subjects carrying the CYP3A4*1/*1 and CYP3A4*1/*1G genotypes in the first post-operative 24 h and 48 h (P < 0.05), and the MAP/HR/Cor/Ang-1 levels gradually decreased immediately after surgery and in the first post-operative 24 h. 3. Subjects with the GG genotype at the A118G polymorphism in the OPRM1 gene consumed significantly more fentanyl than that consumed by subjects with the AA and AG genotypes in the first post-operative 24 h and 48 h (P < 0.05), and the MAP/HR/Cor/Ang-1 levels gradually increased immediately after surgery and in the first post-operative 24 h. 4. There were no significant differences in the adverse reactions to fentanyl in patients with different genotypes (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: These results indicated that the MDR1/CYP3A4/OPRM1 gene polymorphisms influenced the fentanyl consumption and the physiological effects of intravenous analgesia in the Chinese women who received lower segment caesarean section surgeries. Moreover, the present study provides an important foundation and theoretical evidence for the gene-directed rationalization and individualization of medication before caesarean section surgeries.

AB Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious devastating condition and it has a high mortality rate and morbidity rate. The early pathological changes in the immediate phase of SCI may play a major part in the development of secondary injury. Alterations in the expression of many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play fundamental roles in the diseases of the central nervous system. However, the roles of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the immediate phase of SCI are not clear. We examined the expression of mRNAs and lncRNAs in a rat model at 2 h after SCI and identified the differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE lncRNAs) and differentially expressed mRNAs (DE mRNAs) using microarray analysis. 772 DE IncRNAs and 992 DE mRNAs were identified in spinal cord samples in the immediate phase following SCI compared with control samples. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) term annotation results showed that CXCR chemokine receptor binding, neutrophil apoptotic process, neutrophil migration, neutrophil extravasation, macrophage differentiation, monocyte chemotaxis and cellular response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) were the main significantly enriched GO terms. The results of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in toll like receptor signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and Jak-STAT signaling pathway. IL6, MBOAT4, FOS, TNF, JUN, STAT3, CSF2, MYC, CCL2 and FGF2 were the top 10 high-degree hub nodes and may be important targets in the immediate phase of SCI. The current study on provides novel insights into how IncRNAs and mRNAs regulate the pathogenesis of the immediate phase after SCI.

AB Background: Two recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) reported that the FAM13A gene at the 4q22 locus associated with pulmonary fibrosis (defined by rs2609255) overlapping with COPD (defined by rs6837671). We hypothesized that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to lung disease (especially pulmonary fibrosis) identified in this region are also associated with the risk of silicosis.
   Methods: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped these two SNPs (rs2609255 and rs6837671) in a case-control study including 177 silicosis cases and 204 controls with silica dust exposure years similar to the levels for cases in a Chinese population.
   Results: We found that rs2609255 was significantly associated with increased silicosis risk (dominant model: OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.01-2.92; P = 0.047). Additionally, eQTL analysis based on the GTEx database indicated that the rs2609255 polymorphism may alter the expression level of FAM13A in lung tissues (P = 1.8 x 10(-4)). Furthermore, interaction analyses showed that rs2609255 interacts multiplicatively with years of silica dust exposure to contribute to silicosis risk (interaction P = 0.040).
   Conclusions: These results indicate that rs2609255 may modify silicosis susceptibility in the Chinese population.

AB Polyamines (PAs), including putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd), spermine (Spm), and thermospermine (T-Spm), play key roles in plant development, including fruit setting and ripening, morphogenesis, and abiotic/biotic stress. Their functions appear to be intimately related to their synthesis, which occurs via arginine/ornithine decarboxylase (ADC/ODC), Spd synthase (SPDS), Spm synthase (SPMS), and Acaulis5 (ACL5), respectively. Unfortunately, the expression and function of these PA synthesis-relate genes during specific developmental process or under stress have not been fully elucidated. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide analysis of the PA synthesis genes (ADC, ODC, SPDS, SPMS, ACL5) in the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). In total, 14 PA synthesis-related genes were identified. Further analysis of their structures, conserved domains, phylogenetic trees, predicted subcellular localization, and promoter cis-regulatory elements were analyzed. Furthermore, we also performed experiments to evaluate their tissue expression patterns and under hormone and various stress treatments. To our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate the mechanisms underlying PA function in this variety of tomato. Taken together, these data provide valuable information for future functional characterization of specific genes in the PA synthesis pathway in this and other plant species. Although additional research is required, the insight gained by this and similar studies can be used to improve our understanding of PA metabolism ultimately leading to more effective and consistent plant cultivation.

AB Lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRLKs) are membrane-bound receptors that are believed to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, little is known about the LecRLK family in pear. In this study, a total of 172 LecRLK genes were first identified in the entire pear genome. The 172 LecRLKs were divided into three types (111 G-, 59 L- and two C-types) based on their structure and phylogenetic relationships. LecRLKs gene expressions were detected in different pear tissues including roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, and the most of the 11 selected LecRLKs exhibited similar expression patterns. Furthermore, six selected LecRLKs were shown to be involved in salt stress response. Overexpression of PbLRK138, an L-type LecRLK, caused cell death and induced expression of defense-related genes in Nicotiana benthamiana. Two deletion mutants containing lectin or transmembrane and serine/threonine kinase domains did not trigger cell death. In addition, only the mutant with the transmembrane domain was localized to the plasma membrane.

AB Malignant testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most frequent testicular cancers in Caucasian males, developing at the most productive age of man. We are briefly reviewing TGCT-tumorigenesis with an emphasis on epigenetics. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications together with RNA interference that all change gene expression are driving early spermatogenesis. Deregulation of normal development might lead to a testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), from which TGCTs originate. The breakthrough epigenetic research, both in normal development and TGCT tumorigenesis, has been going on to find better biomarkers and therapy for this type of tumors.

AB Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrinopathy characterized by anovulatory infertility, hyperan-drogenism, insulin resistance and oxidative stress, which predisposes affected women to reproductive and cardiometabolic complications in later life. We have investigated the association of PON1 promoter polymorphisms with PCOS susceptibility, PON1 activity and its related traits in Indian women. The genotypic and allelic frequency distribution of only - 907G/C polymorphism in PON1 promoter showed significant difference between non-hyperandrogenic control and PCOS women, and was significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to PCOS, considering the recessive model. PON1 lactonase and arylesterase activities were also significantly decreased in women with PCOS compared to controls. Further, PON1 promoter polymorphisms were linked to altered insulin and testosterone levels in hyperandrogenic and non-hyperandrogenic women with PCOS. This study highlights PON1 as an important candidate gene influencing genetic pathophysiology of PCOS.

TI Effects of Rosuvastatin on the expression of the genes involved in
   cholesterol metabolism in rats: adaptive responses by extrahepatic

   INDUCTION; MECHANISM; RECEPTOR
AB Background: Statins mostly target the liver; therefore, increase in the synthesis of cholesterol by extra-hepatic tissues and then transferring this cholesterol to the liver can be regarded as adaptive responses by these tissues. In addition to cholesterol, these adaptive responses can increase isoprenoid units as the byproducts of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway; isoprenoids play a key role in regulating cell signaling pathways and cancer development. Thus, there is a primary need for in vivo investigation of the effects of statins on the cholesterol metabolism in the extra-hepatic tissues.
   Materials: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control (n = 9) and treatment (n = 9) groups. The treatment group was orally given 10 mg/kg/day of Rosuvastatin for 6 weeks. Then, serum lipid profile, expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), ABCA1, ABCG1 and ApoA1, and activity of HMGCR were measured in the liver, intestine and adipose tissues.
   Results: Rosuvastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL-C. The expression levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, and ApoA1 in the liver and HMGCR in both liver and intestine were significantly increased in the Rosuvastatin treated-group. However, in the intestine, there were no significant differences in the expression levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1 between the study groups. Rosuvastatin had no effect on the adipose tissue.
   The HMGCR activity was significantly increased in the liver and intestine of the Rosuvastatin-treated group.
   Conclusions: In spite of the adipose tissue, the intestine efficiently responses to the reduced levels of cholesterol and increases its cholesterogenesis capacity. However, adipose tissue seems to play a small role in correcting cholesterol deficiency during the course of statin therapy.

AB Background: Diabetic nephropathy is the single strongest predictor of mortality in patients with diabetes. The development of overt nephropathy involves important inter-individual variations, even after adjusting for potential confounding influences of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Genome-wide transcriptome studies have reported the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and there is mounting indication of the role of genetic factors.
   Methods: We screened nine genetic variations in three cytokine genes (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL beta) in 1326 unrelated subjects comprising of healthy controls (n = 464), type 2 diabetics with nephropathy (DN, n = 448) and type 2 diabetes without nephropathy (T2D, n = 414) by sequence-specific amplification. Functional implication of SNPs was elucidated by correlation studies and relative gene expression using Realtime-Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
   Results: Individual SNP analysis showed highest association of IL-1 beta rs16944-TT genotype (OR = 3.51, 95%CI = 2.36-5.21, P = 0.001) and TNF-alpha rs1800629-AA genotype (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.64-4.59, P = 0.001) with T2D and DN respectively. The haplotype frequency showed significant risk of seven combinations among T2D and four combinations among DN subjects. The highest risk of T2D and DN was associated with GGTGAGTTT (OR = 4.25, 95%CI = 3.3-14.20, P = 0.0016) and GACGACCTT (OR = 21.3, 95%Cl = 15.1-28.33, P = 0.026) haplotypes respectively. Relative expression by RT-qPCR showed increased cytokine expression in cases as compared to controls. TNF-alpha expression was increased by more than four-folds (n-fold = 4.43 +/- 1.11) in DN. TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta transcript levels were significantly modulated by promoter region SNPs.
   Conclusions: The present study implicates a strong association between cytokine TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta gene promoter polymorphisms and modulation of transcript levels with susceptibility to nephropathy in diabetes subjects.

AB Objective: Orf virus (ORFV) is the pathogen causing contagious pustular dermatitis in goats, sheep and herdsmen. Evidence has confirmed that ORFV can be used as a preventive and therapeutic immunomodulatory agent in several animal models. Our previous data demonstrated that ORFV024 is able to inhibit activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and act as an important modulator for early immune responses against viral infection. However, the molecular mechanism by which ORFV024 exerting biological function remains unclear. In the present study, we explored and analyzed the function of host cellular proteins that interact with ORFV024.
   Methods: The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay was performed to screen proteins interacting with ORFV024 using a cDNA library derived from primary ovine fetal turbinate cells (OFTu). Two of the screened proteins were further confirmed by confocal microscopy, His-tag pull-down assay and CO-Immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) assay. In addition, the ORFV024 interaction network was constructed using the STRING database.
   Results: In this study, 11 ovine cellular proteins were found to interact with ORFV024. In view of the importance of LAGE3 and IGFBP6 in the ORFV024 functional analysis, we further constructed LAGE3 and IGFBP6 interaction networks. The interactions between ORFV024 and LAGE3 or IGFBP6 were confirmed by confocal microscopy, LAGE3 was further confirmed in the His-tag pull-down assay and CO-IP assay.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that ORFV024 can interact with ovine cellular proteins LAGE3 and IGFBP6.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to screen key genes and pathways involved in obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and predict drugs for treatment of obese PCOS via bioinformatics approaches.
   Methods: Microarray dataset GSE10946 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 7 cumulus cell samples from obese PCOS patients and 6 lean control samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between obese PCOS and controls were obtained using Bayesian test after data preprocessing, followed by functional enrichment analyses for DEGs. Besides, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sub-network analyses were performed. Furthermore, drug prediction was carried out based on the DEGs.
   Results: A total of 793 DEGs were identified in PCOS compared with control, including 352 up-regulated and 441 down-regulated DEGs. Specifically, upregulated RNA polymerase I subunit B (POLR1B), DNA polymerase epsilon 3, accessory subunit (POLE3), and DNA polymerase delta 3, accessory subunit (POLD3) were enriched in pathway of pyrimidine metabolism associated with obesity and PCOS, and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (HTR2C) was enriched calcium signaling pathway. Additionally, 10 significant potential drugs, such as spironolactone targeting androgen receptor (AR), trimipramine targeting adrenoceptor beta 2 (ADRB2), and L-ornithine targeting ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 3 (OAZ3), were obtained.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, POLR1B, POLE3, POLD3, and HTR2C might play important roles in obese PCOS via involvement of pyrimidine metabolism and calcium signaling pathway. Moreover, AR, ADRB2, and OAZ3 might be targets of spironolactone, trimipramine, and L-ornithine in the treatment of obese PCOS.

AB The orange-spotted grouper (OG), Epinephelus coioides, is an ecologically and economically important species with strong market demand. However, larval rearing for this species is especially difficult, with mass mortality occurring at multiple stages including the period coinciding with metamorphic development. The aim of the present study was to characterise the molecular ontogenesis of genes that influence appetite, feeding, and digestion in OG larvae head and body tissue at 12, 18, and 50 days post hatch (dph), which coincides with the beginning and end of metamorphic development. The sequences of many transcripts involved in the regulation of appetite, feeding and digestive processes were detected from 12 dph in OG larvae, including those that were differentially expressed in body tissue in fish at different stages of development such as cholecystokinin, peptide Y, and meprin A. Of the transcripts encoding digestive enzymes, only the expression level of bile salt-activated lipase decreased as development progressed. In contrast, a dramatic increase in expression for other body-expressed transcripts encoding digestive enzymes and a proton pump subunit was observed at 50 dph, which is indicative of an increase in digestive capacity. In addition, we have provided evidence suggesting that various trypsinogen isoforms are present, and have differing expression patterns throughout larval development in whole body tissue. We also report on the presence of a prey-specific transcript encoding alpha-amylase that was present in the body-transcriptome. Taken together, these results give insight into the processes underpinning attainment of digestive capacity, and form the basis of a new transcriptomic database that will aid further study into the digestive development and dietary requirements of orange-spotted grouper larvae.

AB Pyrus ussuriensis is extremely cold hardy when fully acclimated, but knowledge relevant to the molecular mechanisms underlying this economically valuable trait is still limited so far. In this study, global transcriptome profiles of Pyrus ussuriensis under cold conditions (4 degrees C) over a time course were generated by high-throughput sequencing. In total, > 57,121,199 high quality clean reads were obtained with approximately 11.0 M raw data for each library. Among them, the values of 66.84%-72.03% of clean reads in the digital transcript abundance measurement could be well mapped to the pear genome database, resulting in the identification of 8544 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) having 43 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 17 clusters of orthologous groups (COG) involved in 385 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) defined pathways. These comprised 3124 (1033 up-regulated, 2091 down-regulated), 1243 (729 up-regulated, 514 down-regulated), and 750 (458 up-regulated, 292 down-regulated) genes from the cold-treated samples at 5, 12 and 24 h, respectively. The accuracy of the RNA-Seq derived transcript expression data was validated by analyzing the expression patterns of 16 DGEs by quantitative real-time PCR. Plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, Photosynthesis, signal transduction, innate immune response and response to biotic stimulus were the most significantly enriched GO categories among in the DEGs. A total of 335 transcription factors were shown to be cold responsive. In addition, a number of genes involved in the catabolism and signaling of hormones were significantly affected by the cold stress. The RNA-Seq and digital expression profiling provides valuable insights into the understanding the molecular events related to cold responses in Pyrus ussuriensis and dataset may help guide future identification and functional analysis of potential genes that are important for enhancing cold hardiness.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered key players in the regulation of a broad range of biological processes. Specifically, miRNAs have been reported to play an important role in the process of adipogenesis. In this study, we constructed a model of adipogenesis by isolating preadipocytes (WCC) derived from adipose tissue and preadipocytes after 72 h differentiation (WCT) in vitro. Deep sequencing of miRNAs expressed in WCT and WCC cells was conducted; we identified 105 differentially expressed miRNA candidates (fifty up-regulated and fiftyfive down-regulated). Among them, twelve were novel miRNAs, and ninety-three were previously known miRNAs. Furthermore, seven miRNAs were selected for expression confirmation by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR); the results showed that the differential expression of miRNAs between the two groups was consistent with our sequencing results. Of them, miR-223, miR-184-3p, and miR-10b-5 showed a strong correlation to adipogenesis. Using target prediction, we predicted that the 105 differentially expressed miRNAs targeted 4155 unique mRNAs. The prediction of targets of differentially expressed miRNAs revealed that the miRNAs participated in the regulation of multiple adipogenesis-related signalling pathways, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling pathway, insulin signalling pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid degradation. Overall, our findings provide a background for further research into miRNAs and lay a foundation for the prediction and analysis of miRNAs related to adipogenesis.

AB BST-2(tetherin/CD317/HM1.24) has been identified as a cellular antiviral factor that inhibits the release of a wide range of enveloped viruses from infected cells. Orthologs of BST-2 have been identified in several species including humans, monkeys, cows, sheep, pigs, and mice. In this study, we cloned the gene and characterized the protein of the BST-2 homolog from sika deer (Cervus nippon). cnBST-2 shares 37.8% and 74.2% identity with the BST-2 homologs from Homo sapiens and Ovis aries, respectively. The extracellular domain of cnBST-2 has two putative N-linked glycosylation sites and three potential dimerization sites. cnBST-2 was shown to be expressed on the cell surface, like human BST-2. Exogenous expression of cnBST-2 resulted in potent inhibition of HIV-1 particle release in 293T cells; however, this activity resisted antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu. Moreover, cnBST-2 was not able to activate nuclear factor-kappa B, in contrast to human BST-2. This study is the first report of the isolation and characterization of BST-2 from C. nippon.

AB Ganoderma lucidum is a valuable basidiomycete with numerous pharmacological compounds, which is widely consumed throughout China. We previously found that the polysaccharide content of Ganoderma lucidum fruiting bodies could be significantly improved by 45.63% with treatment of 42 degrees C heat stress (HS) for 2 h. To further investigate genes involved in HS response and explore the mechanisms of HS regulating the carbohydrate metabolism in Ganoderma lucidum, high-throughput RNA-Seq was conducted to analyse the difference between control and heat treated mycelia at transcriptome level. We sequenced six cDNA libraries with three from control group (mycelia cultivated at 28 degrees C) and three from heat-treated group (mycelia subjected to 42 degrees C for 2 h). A total of 99,899 transcripts were generated using Trinity method and 59,136 unigenes were annotated by seven public databases. Among them, 2790 genes were identified to be differential expressed genes (DEGs) under HS condition, which included 1991 up-regulated and 799 down-regulated. 176 DEGs were then manually classified into five main responsive-related categories according to their putative functions and possible metabolic pathways. These groups include stress resistance-related factors; protein assembly, transportation and degradation; signal transduction; carbohydrate metabolism and energy provision-related process; other related functions, suggesting that a series of metabolic pathways in Ganoderma lucidum are activated by HS and the response mechanism involves a complex molecular network which needs further study. Remarkably, 48 DEGs were found to regulate carbohydrate metabolism, both in carbohydrate hydrolysis for energy provision and polysaccharide synthesis. In summary, this comprehensive transcriptome analysis will provide enlarged resource for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of basidiomycete under HS condition.

AB Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most serious diseases that could threaten the life of neonates. However the current opinions about the pathogenesis or how to prevent or treat the disease are still ambiguous. The purpose of the present study was to identify the key genes of this disease and provide new insights into the mechanism of NEC. The gene expression data of GSE46619, including 5 specimens from NEC patients and 4 samples from surgical-control infants, were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened with regard to NEC versus surgical-control group using Limma package in R software and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were conducted by means of Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website subsequently. Furthermore the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for DEGs was constructed using Cytoscape software and the most highly connected module was extracted using MCODE plugin from the PPI network. Moreover, the significantly enriched sub-pathways were identified using iSubpathwayMiner package in R software. A total of 2629 DEGs were screened out between NEC and control samples, including 367 up regulated genes and 2262 down-regulated genes and they involved in different GO terms and pathways which may be associated with NEC onset and progression. PPI network and module analysis revealed that several genes were defined as hub genes including AGT, IL8 and KNG1. The sub-pathway analysis screened out 189 significantly enriched sub-pathways, including Tryptophan metabolism, Fatty acid metabolism, and Arachidonic acid metabolism. Genes in the corresponding sub-pathway, such as ACACB and CAT were regarded as critical genes in NEC. QRT-PCR was also conducted to identify the expression of the five key genes (AGT, IL8, KNG1, ACACB and CAT) in NEC samples. These findings have identified several hub genes (e.g., AGT, 1L8, KNG1, ACACB and CAT) which were presumed to serve critical roles in NEC.

AB Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has been increasing across the world with incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. We aimed to investigate gene alterations and biomarkers contributing to PTC development. A total of five eligible microarray datasets including 94 PTC and 81 normal thyroid samples were included to identify gene expression signatures. Using integrative meta-analysis of expression data (INMEX) program, we identified a total of 2699 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (1333 overexpressed and 1366 underexpressed genes) in PTC relative to normal thyroid samples. The top 100 upregualted and downregulated DEGs identified in the meta analysis were further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset for PTC with high consistency. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, focal adhesion, axon guidance, and ECM-receptor interaction among the top 5 most enriched pathways. Network-based meta-analysis identified FN1 and TRAF6 to be the most highly ranked hub genes among the overexpressed and underexpressed genes, respectively, both of which are involved in pathways in cancer. The most enriched terms for Gene Ontology (GO) of biological processes, cellular component, and molecular function were signal transduction, cytoplasm, and protein binding, respectively. Our meta-analysis comprehensively investigated DEGs, hub genes, enriched pathways and GO terms for PTC, which might provide additional approaches to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of PTC, and identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets toward PTC.

AB Systems biology approaches can help understand pathogenesis of complex human diseases like cancers for identification of potential new therapeutic targets. Here in this study, we performed genome-wide screening for mRNA and IncRNA profiles in esophageal cancer to identify the novel cancer-related mRNA and IncRNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We identified 1260 up-regulated/1445 down-regulated mRNAs and 402 up-regulated/741 down-regulated lncRNAs. Further functional analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of mRNA and IncRNA are related to different pathways. mRNA pathways are mainly involved in cell cycles while 1ncRNA pathways are for regulation and metabolic procession. Differentially expressed mRNAs/lncRNAs were validated with qPCR. At last, mRNA and IncRNA co-expression network were built and highly-connected networks were identified, which may provide a mechanism of mRNA expression regulation by 1ncRNA. In together, we used next generation sequencing data to explore the co-expression networks of 1ncRNA and mRNA, which may elucidate the functions and mechanisms of IncRNA in ESCC.

AB Background: Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAH), encoded by SERPINE1 gene, is a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily, and polymorphisms in SERPINE1 have been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study investigated whether the polymorphism in PAI-I contribute to the risk for T2D.
   Methods: A 1:1 case-control study was conducted to investigate the association of rs6092 in SERPINE1 with T2D and diabetes-related metabolic traits, including body mass index, waist circumference (WC), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) in a Chinese population, with a total of 1572 subjects (786 T2D patients and 786 healthy controls). The polymorphism was genotyped based on MassARRAY genotyping system.
   Results: The AA genotype and A allele of rs6092 exerted a protective effect on T2D risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.431 and 0.630, respectively). In a recessive model, we also observed the protective association of rs6092 with T2D (OR = 0.195). The above associations were only observed in men. In female patients, there was a significant difference in HbAlc level between the AA homozygotes and GG homozygotes, as well as between the AA homozygotes and combined GG and GA genotypes. In male patients, the WC level in the subjects carrying AA genotype was lower than those in the subjects with GG genotype (P = 0.000), and the association was also significant in a recessive model (P = 0.000). Additionally, there was a significant difference in TG level between the AA homozygotes and GG homozygotes (P = 0.017), as well as the AA homozygotes and combined GG and GA genotypes (P = 0.032).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that the A allele and AA genotype of rs6092 may protect against T2D, and have a protective effect on WC, but a negative effect on TG in men, while may contribute to a lower HbA1c level in women.

AB Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) are relatively common malformations in newborns, but the etiology of EA/TEF remains unknown. Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group A (FANCA) is a key component of the FA core complex and is essential for the activation of the DNA repair pathway. The middle region (amino acids 674-1208) of FANCA is required for its interaction with FAAP20. We performed targeted sequencing of this binding region of FANCA (exons 23-36) in 40 EA/TEF patients. We also investigated the effect of the p.A958V mutation on the protein-protein interaction between FANCA and FAAP20 using an in vitro binding assay and co-immunoprecipitation. Immunolocalization analysis was performed to investigate the subcellular localization of FANCA, and tissue sections and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the expression of FANCA. We identified four rare missense variants in the FANCA binding region. FANCA mutations were significantly overrepresented in EA/TEF patients compared with 4300 control subjects from the NHLBI-ESP project (Fisher's exact p = 2.17 x 10(-5), odds ratio = 31.75). p.A958V, a novel de novo mutation in the FANCA gene, was identified in one patient with EA/TEF. We provide further evidence that the p.A958V mutation reduces the binding affinity of FANCA for FAAP20. Interestingly, the p.A958V mutation impaired the nuclear localization of the FANCA protein expressed in HeLa cells. We found that FANCA was more highly expressed in stratified squamous epithelium than in smooth muscle. In conclusion, mutations in the FANCA gene are associated with EA/TEF in humans.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronically progressive neurodegenerative disease, with its main pathological hallmarks being a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons predominantly in the Substantia Nigra (SN), and the formations of intracytoplasmic Lewy bodies and dystrophic neurites. Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), widely recognized as the most prominent element of the Lewy body, is one of the representative hallmarks in PD. However, the mechanisms behind the increased alpha-syn expression and aggregation have not yet been clarified. To examine what causes alpha-syn expression to increase, we analyzed the pattern of gene expression in the SN of mice intoxicated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), where down-regulation of dopaminergic cells occurred. We identified serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase 1 (SGK1) as one of the genes that is evidently downregulated in chronic MPTP-intoxication. The results of Western blot analyses showed that, together with the down-regulation of dopaminergic cells, the decrease in SGK1 expression increased alpha-syn expression in the SN in a chronic MPTP-induced Parkinsonism mouse. For an examination of the expression correlation between SGK1 and alpha-syn, SH-SYSY cells were knocked down with SGK1 siRNA then, the down regulation of dopaminergic cells and the increase in the expression of alpha-syn were observed. These results suggest that decreased expression of SGK1 may play a critical role in increasing the expression of alpha-syn, which is related with dopaminergic cell death in the SN of chronic MPTP-induced Parkinsonism mice and in SH-SY5Y cells.

TI Inhibition of hsa-miR-6086 protects human umbilical vein endothelial

AB MiRNAs are considered as a novel class of biomarkers or treatment targets for cardiovascular diseases. Hsa-miR-6086, a novel mi-RNA, was reported to be downregulated during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells (ECs). Interestingly, CDH5 (cadherin 5), encoding a classical cadherin of the cadherin superfamily, is a cellular marker of ECs and has been reported to be a target of hsa-miR-6086. However, the role of hsa-miR-6086 in ECs is virtually unknown. Herein, we report that hsa-miR-6086 was markedly induced by TNF alpha stimulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas CDH5 expression was greatly reduced. Importantly, TNFa-induced suppression of CDH5 expression was largely prevented by inhibiting hsa-miR-6086, and hsa-miR-6086 mimic greatly decrease CDH5 expression in HUVECs, suggesting that the induction of hsa-miR-6086 is responsible for CDH5 downregulation by TNF alpha. In addition, restoration of CDH5 expression level by either inhibiting hsa-miR-6086 or exogenously expressing CDH5 cDNA that is not affected by hsa-miR-6086 protected HUVECs against TNF alpha-induced apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. Taken together, our study reveals that hsa-miR-6086 is induced by TNF alpha and mediates TNF alpha-induced HUVEC growth inhibition through downregulating CDH5 expression. Hence, hsa-miR-6086 might be a new target for treating TNF alpha-induced endothelial dysfunction.

AB In this work, the effects of selenium (Se) on the nutritional quality of tomato fruit were investigated. The results showed that application of 1 mg L-1 sodium selenate foliar spray increased Se content in the fruit without affecting other concentrations of other metals. Se treatment elevated the contents of soluble sugars (glucose and fructose), amino acids, and bioactive compounds, such as flavanoids, glutathione, vitamin C, and vitamin E, in pink tomato fruit. Proteomic analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification was performed on tomato fruit at the commercial harvest stage. When comparing Se-enriched tomato fruit with the control group, we identified an aggregate of 269 differentially expressed proteins. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acids metabolism, and secondary metabolism were highly affected by Se treatment. The results help elucidate the mechanism of Se treatment on improved nutritional quality of tomato fruit.

AB Hydrogels swell, shrink and degrade depending on the solution they are in contact which, strongly affecting their performance. The minimum information needed to validate many published simulations would be the spatial quantification of the solute material with time. In this study we develop a simple methodology to quantify the protein content in heat induced protein hydrogels using a commercial Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) microscope. The system is used to quantify the whey protein isolate (WPI) concentration in hydrogels undergoing dissolution at alkaline pH. Quantitative measurements were performed in hydrogels up to depths of similar to 600 mu m, with an average accuracy of similar to 1 wt%. Results show that the protein concentration within the swollen layer is constant with time, confirming the existence of steady state conditions during dissolution. The methodology presented can easily be implemented to other biopolymer hydrogels and foods.

AB Analysis of proteins in bovine milk is usually tackled by time-consuming analytical approaches involving wet-chemical, multi-step sample clean-up procedures. The use of external cavity-quantum cascade laser (EC-QCL) based IR spectroscopy was evaluated as an alternative screening tool for direct and simultaneous quantification of individual proteins (i.e. casein and beta-lactoglobulin) and total protein content in commercial bovine milk samples. Mid-IR spectra of protein standard mixtures were used for building partial least squares (PLS) regression models. A sample set comprising different milk types (pasteurized; differently processed extended shelf life, ESL; ultra-high temperature, UHT) was analysed and results were compared to reference methods. Concentration values of the QCL-IR spectroscopy approach obtained within several minutes are in good agreement with reference methods involving multiple sample preparation steps. The potential application as a fast screening method for estimating the heat load applied to liquid milk is demonstrated.

AB Extracts of jabuticaba peels show complex chromatographic profiles at 360 nm, with some peaks presenting UV-Vis spectra resembling those of flavonol glycosides and others resembling that of ellagic acid. The presence and tentative identification of these phenolic compounds were comprehensively studied in four species of Brazilian jabuticaba fruit - Plinia trunciflora, variety 'jabuticaba de cabinho'; P. caulifora, varieties 'jabuticaba paulista' and 'jabuticaba canaa-acu'; P. jaboticaba, variety 'jabuticaba sabara'; and P. phitrantha, variety 'jabuticaba branca-vinho' - using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn. Seventeen flavonols derived from quercetin and three from myricetin and eighteen derivatives of ellagic acid and eleven of methyl ellagic acid were detected. Most of them were newly described and mainly occurred in glycosylated and acylglycosylated forms. Some compounds were missing in one variety, such as the absence of methyl ellagic acid derivatives in 'jabuticaba branca-vinho', and others only appeared in one variety, thus suggesting potential capacity for varietal differentiation.

AB Using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-Q-TOF-MS), we have developed a new method for detection and identification of furan fatty acids (F-acids), which are widely distributed in living organisms and foods as minor lipid components and are known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. For this purpose, total fatty acids prepared from the testis lipids of Japanese chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) were examined without any concentration or isolation of F-acids. In negative ESI mode, F-acids gave a prominent [M-H]-ion, by which individual F-acids could be detected and identified. High-resolution extracted ion chromatograms clearly showed the occurrence of five major F-acid homologs as already reported by GC/MS. The method was successfully applied to several fish samples and revealed the occurrence of F-acids for the first time in the two New Zealand fish, hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) and school shark (Galeorhinus galeus).

AB The present study investigated the effect of different irradiation dose (0, 3, 5 and 7 kGy) on the emulsifying properties development of pork myofibrillar protein (MP) and sacroplasmic protein (SP). The results showed that emulsifying activities of SP was significantly impaired by the increasing irradiation dose, while that of MP were only observed to be significantly improved at 3 kGy irradiation (P <.05). The increasing irradiation dose caused the increase of SP carbonyl groups and the decrease of its sulfhydryl groups (P <.05), while 3 kGy irradiation decreased the carbonyl groups of MP and increased.-potential significantly (P <.05). LF-NMR results revealed that the water hydration in MP structure was dose-dependent. FT-IR data displayed that irradiation caused minor change of SP in the amide I region from 1700 to 1600 cm(-1), while >= 5 kGy irradiation significantly contributed to the denatured aggregated beta-sheet components of MP.

AB The inhibitory potential of Montmorency tart cherry on glycemia regulation and other enzymes relevant to inflammation were evaluated. Tart cherry has superior inhibitory potential against key enzymes associated with carbohydrate digestion linked to hypertension. In particular, alpha-amylase activity was significantly inhibited (IC50= 3.46 +/- 0.06 mg/ml), whereas we observed mild inhibition of alpha-glucosidase (IC50= 11.64 +/- 0.65 mg/ml). Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition was also strong by about 89%. Tart cherry extract showed strong to moderate inhibitions of cyclooxygenase-1 (65%), lipoxygenase (64%), cyclooxygenase- 2 (38%) and xanthine oxidase (26%), respectively. Anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-rutinoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside, were strong inhibitors of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. Kaempferol showed relatively potent inhibition on COX and XO. It was revealed that some pairs of metabolites manifest positive or negative interactions against XO enzyme inhibition. Inhibition of all these enzymes provides a strong biochemical basis for management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease by controlling glucose absorption, reducing associated hypertension and inflammation.

AB A QuEChERS extraction method followed by HPLC-MS/MS analysis was developed to simultaneously analyze chlordecone and its metabolite chlordecol in animal livers. The overall method was validated with accuracy profiles according to the French Standard NF V03-110 and European Union guidelines. The validation was performed on bovine, ovine and porcine liver samples. Linearity, matrix effect, accuracy, within-laboratory repeatability, specificity, LOQ, Q/q relative ion intensities, and uncertainty were reported. Recoveries were between 70% and 120%. LOQs of 1.36 mu g chlordecone kg(-1) and 2.50 mu g chlordecol kg(-1) of fresh liver were found. Twelve contaminated livers of bovine, ovine and porcine origin from the French West Indies or samples from in vivo studies were analyzed. In these liver samples from contaminated animals, chlordecone was quantified at concentrations higher than the maximum residue limit and chlordecol in very low amounts in all the samples. In addition, these results confirm that chlordecone can be metabolized in ruminant species.

AB The molecular nature of interactions between beta-casein and p-coumaric acid was studied following exposure of their solutions to ultra-high temperature (UHT at 145 degrees C). Interactions were characterised by employing multi-spectroscopic methods, molecular docking and quantum mechanics calculations. FTIR demonstrates that the ligand lies in the vicinity of the protein, hence inverting the absorbance spectrum of the complex. This outcome changes the conformational characteristics of the protein leading to a flexible and open structure that accommodates the phenolic microconstituent. Results are supported by UV-vis, CD and fluorescence quenching showing considerable shifts in spectra with complexation. Molecular docking indicates that there is at least a hydrogen bond between p-coumaric acid and the peptide backbone of isoleucine (Ile27). Quantum mechanics calculations further argue that changes in experimental observations are also due to a covalent interaction in the protein-phenolic adduct, which according to the best predicted binding pose involves the side chain of lysine 47.

AB To identify food and beverages that provide the regular intake of natural compounds capable of interfering with toxic amyloidogenic aggregates, we developed an experimental protocol that combines NMR spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, in vitro biochemical and cell assays to detect anti-A beta molecules in natural edible matrices.
   We applied this approach to investigate the potential anti-amyloidogenic properties of coffee and its molecular constituents.
   Our data showed that green and roasted coffee extracts and their main components, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and melanoidins, can hinder A beta on-pathway aggregation and toxicity in a human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Coffee extracts and melanoidins also counteract hydrogen peroxide- and rotenone-induced cytotoxicity and modulate some autophagic pathways in the same cell line.

AB Ambient mass spectrometry using an interchangeable thermal desorption/electrospray ionization source (TD-ESI) is a relatively new technique that has had only a limited number of applications to date. Nevertheless, this direct-analysis technique has potential for wider use in analytical chemistry (e.g., in the rapid direct detection of contaminants, residues, and adulterants on and in food) when operated in dual-working mode (pretreatment-free qualitative screening and conventional quantitative confirmation) after switching to a TD-ESI source from a conventional ESI source. Herein, we describe the benefits and challenges associated with the use of a TD-ESI source to detect adulterants on traditional Chinese pastries (TCPs), as a proof-of-concept for the detection of illegal colorants. While TD-ESI can offer direct (i.e., without any sample preparation) qualitative screening analyses for TCPs with adequate sensitivity within 30 s, the use of TD-ESI for semi-quantification is applicable only for homogeneous matrices (e.g., tang yuan).

AB Enzymatic browning is a major issue that needs to be solved in the food industry. Although swertiajaponin is a flavonoid rich in the whole herb of Swertia japonica that has been clinically used, its biological functions and application in the foods have not been fully elucidated. Here, we showed that swertiajaponin efficiently blocked enzymatic browning in potatoes possibly by direct binding to and inactivating polyphenol oxidase. Furthermore, swertiajaponin showed potent antioxidant activity proven by markedly suppressed reactive oxygen species. Swertiajaponin significantly increased antioxidant properties of potato extract when it is added since it additively elevated total flavonoid content. Considering numerous beneficial effects of antioxidants, swertiajaponin may be used as a functional food additive to suppress enzymatic browning and elevate the antioxidant capacity of foods including beverages and soups by fortification of flavonoids.

   CHEMISTRY
AB Beta-bitter acids of hops (lupulones) revealed sedative and antidepressant-like effects in animal studies. Transformation of beta-acids during beer brewing leads to the formation of tricyclic transformation products, which have a close structural analogy to hyperforin. The latter compound is responsible for the antidepressant activity of St. John's wort by activation of TRPC6 cation channels in neuronal-like cells leading to Ca2+ influx. In this study, nortricyclolupones, dehydrotricyclolupones, and tricyclolupones were isolated from a wort-boiling model and their structures were elucidated by UHPLC-DAD, UHPLC-ESI--MS/MS and 1D/2D-NMR spectroscopy. Beta-bitter acids and their transformation products induced Ca2+ influx in PC12 cells to the same extent as hyperforin. Application of a Ca2+-free environment abolished the Ca2+ elevation, indicating that the increase is mediated by influx across the plasma membrane. Thus, activation of neuronal-like Ca2+-channels by lupulones and tricyclolupones represent a novel mechanism contributing to the antidepressant activity of hops.

AB For individuals following a gluten-free (GF) diet, rice is commonly the major grain. People following a GF diet have a higher arsenic burden than the general population. We conducted a multielemental market basket study of GF and gluten containing ingredients and prepared foods (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cr, Co, Se, Cd, Sb, Pb, total As, As species, total Hg and methylmercury). Foods containing rice were significantly higher in As, Hg and Pb and lower in Se, Fe, Cu and Zn. Wheat-based foods were higher in Cd. Mercury concentrations were low (< 3.5 ng/g); speciation was predominantly methylmercury. Arsenic and mercury in rice were correlated. GF foods contained significantly more As and Hg. Eating a wide variety of GF grains may reduce contaminant exposure and increase micronutrient status compared to a rice-based GF diet.

AB Tofuyo, a Japanese traditional food, is a fermented soybean curd manufactured in Okinawa region. Due to its original cheese-like flavor, the current study was designed to evaluate the sensory and chemical characteristics of three stepwise ultrafiltration fractions, using 10,000, 3000 and 500 Da membranes and further chromatographic fractions from tofuyo. The results showed that umami, sweet and salty were the characteristic tastes of all fractions, with umami intensity evaluated for the fraction with MW less than 500 Da (F-500) as the most prominent among the three fractions. Subsequent Sephadex G-25 SF fractions and RP-HPLC fractions were subjected to sensory and chemical analyses. The tastiest fraction contained sodium chloride, sugars, organic acids, umami and sweet free amino acids, at concentrations above their thresholds. The abundant presence of umami and sweet free amino acids with certain concentrations of sodium chloride and glucose might provide the typical savory taste of tofuyo.

AB A high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) method coupled to Evaporative Light Scattering (ELS) and Refractive Index (RI) detectors were evaluated and compared for the molecular mass (Mw) estimation of pectin in a wide range (0.342-805 kDa). Instrumental parameters of the ELSD were optimised by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) being 73 degrees C the evaporator temperature and 0.9 mL/min the air flow rate. The linear range for the ELSD concentration response was wider (10-2250 mg/L) and better (R-2=0.985) than RID (10-1500 mg/L; R-2=0.875). The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for all pullulans hardly changed in ELSD (LOD: 1.22-1.99 mg/L; LOQ: 4.07-6.63 mg/L); however, RID showed huge variations (LOD: 0.49-10.41 mg/L; LOQ: 1.64-34.70 mg/L), which increased with the Mw. In general, responses of both detectors were similar for the Mw estimation, although pectin characterisation with HPSEC-ELSD exhibited better results in the lowest Mw compounds.

AB Intake of omega-3 fatty acids and phytosterols aids in the reduction of cholesterol and serum triglycerides. However, both fatty acids and phytosterols are susceptible to oxidation. This work coencapsulated echium oil (source of stearidonic and alpha-linolenic fatty acids) and beta-sitosterol (phytosterol) by complex coacervation using different combinations of wall materials, and sinapic acid (SA) and transglutaminase as crosslinkers. High encapsulation yields were obtained (29-93% for SA; 68-100% for the mixture of oil and phytosterols) and retention of 49-99% and 16% for encapsulated and free SA, at 30 days-storage. Treatment with gelatin-arabic gum and 0.075 g SA/g gelatin showed the best results: 0.07 mg MDA/g capsule, and retention of 96, 90 and 74% for alpha-linolenic, stearidonic acid and beta-sitosterol at 30 days of storage, respectively. Thus, coencapsulation of echium oil and phytosterol using SA as the crosslinker was possible, obtaining effective vehicles for protection and application of these compounds in foods.

These constituents require emulsification in order to be bioavailable, and high divalent mineral concentrations may perturb this process, due to precipitations of free fatty acids or bile salt complexation, both pivotal for mixed micelle formation. Though in part based on in vitro or indirect evidence, it appears likely that high-dose supplements of divalent minerals around or even below their recommended dietary allowance perturb the availability of certain liposoluble miroconstituents, in addition to reducing absorption of dietary lipids/cholesterol. In this review, we investigate possible negative influences of divalent minerals, including trace elements (iron, zinc), on the digestion and intestinal uptake of lipophilic dietary constituents, with a focus on carotenoids.

AB A novel multiresidue method is proposed for the determination of 12 5-nitroimidazoles and their metabolites in fish roe samples using UHPLC-MS/MS. A salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction procedure was performed prior to sample analysis. The separation of compounds was accomplished using a C18 Zorbax Eclipse Plus column (50mmx2.1 mm, 1.8 mu m) at 25 degrees C and a mobile phase consisting of 0.025% (v/v) aqueous formic acid and pure MeOH at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Parameters involved in ionization and fragmentation were also optimized. The method was characterized in terms of linearity (R(2 >=)0.9992), extraction efficiency (>= 68.9%), repeatability (RSD <= 9.8%), reproducibility (RSD <= 13.9%) and trueness (recoveries >= 81.4%). Decision limits (CC alpha) and detection capabilities (CC beta) were obtained in the ranges 0.1-1.0 and 0.2-1.7 mu g/kg, respectively.

AB This paper set out to differentiate the Maillard induced glycation reactivity of individual milk proteins using different saccharides under well-defined reaction conditions. alpha-Lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin and beta-casein were incubated with mono-, di-and trisaccharides in the dry state under standardised buffered conditions and glycation was expressed relative to the available reactive groups per protein (DG). Protein reactivity, described by the DG(max) and initial speed of glycation (v), followed the same order for each protein-saccharide incubation: alactalbumin > beta-lactoglobulin >> beta-casein. Glycation of whey proteins by different monosaccharides was double that of beta-casein. Differences in DG between whey proteins and beta-casein decreased with increased saccharide size. A two-fold difference was found for glycation in the presence of the dimers lactose and maltose for ss-casein but not for the whey proteins. The percentage of glycated lysines increased with increased lysine to protein size ratio.

AB In this study, we aim to establish a comprehensive spectral database for analysis of edible oils using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). More than 900 edible oil samples, including 30 types of edible oils, were analyzed and compared, and the characteristic peaks and spectral features of each edible oil were obtained. Edible oils were divided into eight groups based on their characteristic spectral patterns and principal component analysis results. An overall correct rate of 97.2% (98.1% for testing set) was obtained for classification of 435 edible oil products using partial least square-discriminant analysis, with nearly 100% correct rate for commonly used edible oils. Differentiation of counterfeit edible oils, repeatedly cooked edible oils and gutter oils from normal edible oils could also be achieved based on the MALDI-MS spectra. The establishment of this spectral database provides reference spectra for spectral comparison and allows rapid classification of edible oils by MALDI-MS.

AB Fruits and aerial parts of lingonberry could be better developed as dietary supplements if the composition in bioactive phenolic compounds and the best period for collection were known. UPLC/MS analysis revealed the predominant presence of arbutin in leaf and that of flavanols in stems harvested in May, July and September. Anthocyanins, flavanols and benzoic acid derivatives were equally present in fruits. Stem and leaf are highly homologous with (+)-catechin, A- and B-type dimers/trimers, and two quercetin glycosides as major contributors. No or only weak seasonal variations were highlighted for all phenolic classes. Additionally, flavanol oligomers showed a lower mDP for fruit (3-4) than for stem and leaf (4-6). The rate of A-type linkage was 3-5% with A-type subunits in extension mainly. Finally, the content in phenolic compounds (UPLC) correlated well with TPC and the DPPH radical scavenging activity although leaf and stem constituents reacted differently in both antioxidant tests.

AB The nutritional composition - including total and individual phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and the antioxidant capacity - of two commercially available edible flowers, pansy and snapdragon, was studied. The edible flowers did not differ in their carbohydrates, fat, or ash contents, or in total energy, but pansy had higher values of moisture, protein, and total dietary fiber than snapdragon. Phenolic compounds were more abundant in pansy than in snapdragon, and flavonoids were the major compounds, followed by anthocyanins. The phenolic profile of pansy included flavonols, such as quercetin and isorhamnetin glycosides, flavones, such as apigenin glycosides, and anthocyanins, such as cyanidin and delphinidin glycosides; in snapdragon it included flavonol glycosides (e.g. quercetin and kaempferol glycosides) and anthocyanins, such as cyanidin and pelargonidin glycosides. The contents of total carotenoids were 146 and 29 mu g/mg for pansy and snapdragon, respectively, and lutein was the dominant compound.

AB This study compared the use of ultrasound-assisted supercritical CO2 (USC-CO2) extraction to obtain apigenin-rich extracts from Scutellaria barbata D. Don with that of conventional supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) extraction and heat-reflux extraction (HRE), conducted in parallel. This green procedure yielded 20.1% and 31.6% more apigenin than conventional SC-CO2 extraction and HRE, respectively. Moreover, the extraction time required by the USC-CO2 procedure, which used milder conditions, was approximately 1.9 times and 2.4 times shorter than that required by conventional SC-CO2 extraction and HRE, respectively. Furthermore, the theoretical solubility of apigenin in the supercritical fluid system was obtained from the USC-CO2 dynamic extraction curves and was in good agreement with the calculated values for the three empirical density-based models. The second-order kinetics model was further applied to evaluate the kinetics of USC-CO2 extraction. The results demonstrated that the selected model allowed the evaluation of the extraction rate and extent of USC-CO2 extraction.

TI Quadrivalent influenza vaccines in low and middle income countries:
   Cost-effectiveness, affordability and availability
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Editorial Material

   middle income countries
ID TRIVALENT; VACCINATION; THRESHOLDS; TRIAL
AB In high-income countries, there is an increased tendency to replace inactivated seasonal trivalent influenza (TIV) vaccines with quadrivalent (QIV) vaccines as these are considered to give a greater public health benefit. In addition, several recent studies from the USA and Europe indicate that replacement with QIV might also be cost-effective; however, the situation in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) is less clear as few studies have investigated this aspect.
   The paper by de Boer et al. (2018) describes a dynamic modelling study commissioned by WHO that suggests that in LMICs, under certain conditions, QIV might also be more cost-effective than TIV. In this commentary, we discuss some important aspects that policymakers in LMICs might wish to take into account when considering replacing TIV by QIV.
   Indeed, from the data presented in the paper by de Boer et al. it can be inferred that replacing QIV for TIV would mean a 25-29% budget increase for seasonal influenza vaccination in South Africa and Vietnam, resulting in an incremental influenza-related health impact reduction of only 7-8% when a 10% symptomatic attack rate is assumed. We argue that national health budget considerations in LMIC might lead decision-makers to choose other investments with higher health impact for a budget equivalent to roughly a quarter of the yearly TIV immunization costs. In addition to an increased annual cost that would be associated with a decision to replace TIV with QIV, there would be an increased pressure on manufacturers to produce QIV in time for the influenza season requiring manufacturers to produce some components of the seasonal vaccine at risk prior to the WHO recommendations for influenza vaccines.
   Unless the current uncertainties, impracticalities and increased costs associated with QlVs are resolved, TIVs are likely to remain the more attractive option for many LMICs. Each country should establish its context-specific process for decision-making based on national data on disease burden and costs in order to determine whether the health gains out-weigh the additional cost of moving to QIV. For example, immunizing more people in the population, especially those in higher risk groups, with TIV might not only provide better value for money but also deliver better health outcomes in LMICs.
   Countries with local influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity should include in their seasonal influenza vaccine procurement process an analysis of the pros-and cons-of TIV versus QIV, to ensure both feasibility and sustainability of local manufacturing.

AB Reported infant vaccination coverage at age 12 months in Australia is >90%. On-time coverage of the 2-4-6 month schedule and coverage in specific populations is rarely reported. We conducted a population-based cohort study of 1.9 million Australian births, 1996-2012, combining individual birth and perinatal records with immunisation records through probabilistic linkage. We assessed on-time coverage across 13 demographic and perinatal characteristics of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccines (DTP) defined as vaccination 14 days prior to the scheduled due date, to 30 days afterwards. On-time DTP vaccination coverage in non-Aboriginal infants was 88.1% for the 2-month dose, 82.0% for 4-month dose, and 76.7% for 6-month dose; 3-dose coverage was 91.3% when assessed at 12 months. On-time DTP coverage for Aboriginal infants was 77.0%, 66.5%, and 61.0% for the 2-4-6 month dose; 3-dose coverage at 12 months was 79.3%. Appreciable differences in on-time coverage were observed across population subgroups. On-time coverage in non-Aboriginal infants born to mothers with >= 3 previous pregnancies was 62.5% for the 6-month dose (47.9% for Aboriginal infants); up to 23.5 percentage points lower than for first-borns. Infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had coverage 8.7-10.3 percentage points lower than infants born to non-smoking mothers for the 4- and 6-month dose. A linear relationship was apparent between increasing socio-economic disadvantage and decreasing on-time coverage. On-time coverage of the 2-4-6 month schedule is only 50-60% across specific population subgroups representing a significant avoidable public health risk. Aboriginal infants, multiparous mothers, and those who are socio-economically disadvantaged are key groups most likely to benefit from targeted programs addressing vaccine timeliness.

AB One of the economically important diseases in the poultry industry is Marek's disease (MD) which is caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV). The use of current vaccines provides protection against clinical signs of MD in chickens. However, these vaccines do not prevent the transmission of MDV to susceptible hosts, hence they may promote the development of new virulent strains of MDV. This issue persuaded us to explore alternative approaches to control MD in chickens. Induction of innate responses at the early stage of life in the chicken may help to prevent or reduce MDV infection. Further, prophylactic use of Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-Ls) has been shown to generate host immunity against infectious diseases. In this regard, encapsulation of TLR-Ls in Poly(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) may further enhance host responses by controlled release of TLR-Ls for an extended period. Hence, in the current study, protective effects of encapsulated TLR4 and TLR21 ligands, LPS and CpG, respectively, were investigated against MD. Results indicated that administration of encapsulated CpG and LPS first at embryonic day (ED) 18, followed by post-hatch at 14 days-post infection (dpi) intramuscularly, diminished tumor incidence by 60% and 42.8%, respectively at 21dpi compared to the MDV only group. In addition, analysis of cytokine gene profiles of interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-18 and IL-10 in spleen and bursa of Fabricius at different time points suggests that TLR-Ls possibly triggered host responses through the expression of IL-I beta and IL-18 to reduce tumor formation. However, further studies are needed to explore the role of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and other influencing elements like lymphocytes in the hindrance of tumor development by TLR-Ls treatment in chickens.

AB In 2009, Bio-Manguinhos conducted a dose-response study with the yellow fever vaccine, administering the vaccine in the usual mean dose of 27,476 IU (full dose, reference) and in tapered doses (10,447 IU, 3013 IU, 587 IU, 158 IU, and 31 IU) by the usual subcutaneous route and usual volume (0.5 mL). Tapered doses were obtained by dilution in the manufacturer's laboratory, and the test batches presented industrial quality. Doses down to 587 IU showed similar immunogenicity to the full dose (27,476, reference), while the 158 lU and 31 IU doses displayed lower immunogenicity. Seropositivity was maintained at 10 months, except in the group that received the 31 IU dose. The current study aims to determine whether yellow fever seropositivity was maintained eight years after YF vaccination in non-revaccinated individuals. According to the current study's results, seropositivity was maintained in 85% of 318 participants and was similar across groups. The findings support the use of the yellow fever vaccine in fractional doses during outbreaks, but each fractional dose should have at least 587 IU. This study also supports the minimum dose required by WHO, 10001U. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Vaccination protects individuals directly and communities indirectly by reducing transmission. We aimed to determine whether information about herd immunity and local vaccination coverage could change an individual's vaccination plans and concern about influenza.
   Methods: We surveyed Minnesota residents >= 18 years during the 2016 Minnesota State Fair. Participants were asked to identify the definition of herd immunity, to report their history of and plans to receive influenza vaccine, to report their concern about influenza, and to estimate the reported influenza vaccination coverage in their county. After providing educational information about herd immunity and local vaccination rates, we reassessed vaccination plans and concerns. We used logistic regression to estimate predicted percentages for those willing to be vaccinated, for concern about influenza, and for changes in these outcomes after the intervention. We then compared those individuals with and without prior knowledge of herd immunity, accounting for other characteristics.
   Results: Among 554 participants, the median age was 57 years; most were female (65.9%), white (91.0%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (93.9%). Overall, 37.2% of participants did not know about herd immunity and 75.6% thought that the influenza vaccination coverage in their county was higher than it was reported. Those not knowledgeable about herd immunity were significantly less likely than those knowledgeable about the concept to report plans to be vaccinated at baseline (67.8% versus 78.9%; p = 0.004). After learning about herd immunity and influenza vaccination coverage, the proportion of those not knowledgeable about herd immunity who were willing to be vaccinated increased significantly by 7.3 percentage points (p = 0.001). Educating participants eliminated the significant difference in the proportion planning to be vaccinated between these two groups (80.1% of those knowledgeable and 75.1% of those who were not initially knowledgeable became willing; p = 0.148).
   Conclusions: Education about herd immunity and local vaccination coverage could be a useful tool for increasing willingness to vaccinate, generating benefits both to individuals and communities. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by Neisseria meningitidis is a potentially devastating condition that can result in death and is associated with serious long-term sequelae in survivors. Vaccination is the preferred preventative strategy. Quadrivalent polysaccharide-based vaccines that protect against infection caused by meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y are not effective against meningococcal serogroup B (MenB), which was responsible for approximately 60% and 35% of confirmed IMD cases in the European Union and the United States in 2016, respectively. A recombinant protein MenB vaccine (MenB-FHbp [bivalent rLP2086; Trumenbej) has been approved for protection against MenB infection in persons 10-25 years of age in the United States and Canada and for individuals >= 10 years of age in the European Union and Australia. In these regions, MenB-FHbp is approved as a 2- or 3-dose primary vaccination schedule. This report will review the current evidence supporting administration of MenB-FHbp as a 2-dose primary vaccination schedule. Different contexts in which a 2- or 3-dose primary vaccination schedule might be preferred (eg, routine prospective vaccination vs outbreak control) are reviewed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Salmonella is one of the key global causes of food and water borne enteric infections, responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide especially in developing countries. Currently available vaccines against typhoid are moderately effective with several side effects and not efficacious against all Salmonella serovars. Due to limitations of these vaccines and emerging threats of multidrug resistance, developing an effective vaccine against these infections has increasingly become a priority. Heat shock proteins (Hsps), being evolutionarily conserved, represent dominant antigens in the host immune response. In continuation of our earlier studies on the development of S. Typhi DnaK and GroEL vaccine candidates, highly efficacious against Salmonella and multiple pathogens, in the present study, we have designed multi-epitope vaccine candidates common to multiple serovars of Salmonella using bioinformatics approach. Implementing various immunoinformatics tools such as IEDB, EpiJen, BCPRED, ElliPro and VaxiJen, led to the identification of many immunogenic B and T cell epitopes. The 3-D structure model of DnaK was generated to predict conformational B-cell epitopes using ElliPro server. Most promising T cell epitopes (29 CTLs, 18 T-helper cells) were selected based on their binding efficiency with commonly occurring MHC alleles. Finally we narrowed down to 5 protective antigenic peptides (PAPs), comprising highly conserved, antigenic and immunogenic B /T cell epitopes, least homologous with human host. These PAPs were predicted to be non-allergenic by allergenicity prediction tools (SORTALLER and AllerHunter). Hence, these immunogenic epitopes can be used for prophylactic or therapeutic usages specifically to defeat antibiotic-resistant Salmonella. These antigens have been reported for the first time and their conserved nature endow them as potential future vaccine candidates against other multiple pathogens as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccination can significantly reduce worldwide morbidity and mortality to infectious diseases, thereby reducing the health burden as a result of microbial infections. Effective vaccines contain three components: a delivery system, an antigenic component of the pathogen, and an adjuvant. With the growing use of purely recombinant or synthetic antigens, there is a need to develop novel adjuvants that enhance the protective efficacy of a vaccine against infection. Using a structure-activity relationship (SAR) model, we describe here the synthesis of a novel TLR4 ligand adjuvant compound, BECC438, by bacterial enzymatic combinatorial chemistry (BECC). This compound was identified using an in vitro screening pipeline consisting of (i) NF kappa B activation and cytokine production by immortalized cell lines, (ii) cytokine production by primary human PBMCs, and (iii) upregulation of surface costimulatory markers by primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Using this SAR screening regimen, BECC438 was shown to produce an innate immune activation profile comparable to the well-characterized TLR4 agonist adjuvant compound, phosphorylated hexa-acyl disaccharide (PHAD). To evaluate the in vivo adjuvant activity of BECC438, we used the known protective Yersinia pestis (Yp) antigen, rF1-V, in a murine prime-boost vaccination schedule followed by lethal challenge. In addition to providing protection from lethal challenge, BECC438 stimulated production of higher levels of rF1 -V-specific total IgG as compared to PHAD after both prime and boost vaccinations. Similar to PHAD, BECC438 elicited a balanced IgG1/IgG2c response, indicative of active T(H)2/T(H)1-driven immunity. These data demonstrate that the novel BECC-derived TLR4L adjuvant, BECC438, elicits cytokine profiles in vitro similar to PHAD, induces high antigen-specific immune titers and a T(H)1-associated IgG2c immune titer skew, and protects mice against a lethal Yp challenge.

AB Background: Immunization against numerous potentially life-threatening illnesses has been a great public health achievement. In the United States, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program has provided vaccines to uninsured and underinsured children since the early 1990s, increasing vaccination rates. In recent years, some states have adopted Universal Purchase (UP) programs with the stated aim of further increasing vaccination rates. Under UP programs, states also purchase vaccines for privately-insured children at federally-contracted VFC prices and bill private health insurers for the vaccines through assessments.
   Methods: In this study, we estimated the effect of UP adoption in a state on children's vaccination rates using state-level and individual-level data from the 1995-2014 National Immunization Survey. For the state-level analysis, we performed ordinary least squares regression to estimate the state's vaccination rate as a function of whether the state had UP in the given year, state demographic characteristics, other vaccination policies, state fixed effects, and a time trend. For the individual analysis, we performed logistic regression to estimate a child's likelihood of being vaccinated as a function of whether the state had UP in the given year, the child's demographic characteristics, state characteristics and vaccine policies, state fixed effects, and a time trend. We performed separate regressions for each of nine recommended vaccines, as well as composite measures on whether a child was up-to-date on all required vaccines.
   Results: In the both the state-level and individual-level analyses, we found UP had no significant (p < 0.10) effect on any of the vaccines or composite measures in our base case specifications. Results were similar in alternative specifications.
   Conclusions: We hypothesize that UP was ineffective in increasing vaccination rates. Policymakers seeking to increase vaccination rates would do well to consider other policies such as addressing provider practice issues and vaccine hesitancy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adjuvants potentiate and direct the type of immunity elicited during vaccination. However, there is a shortage of adjuvants that elicit robust type-I immunity required for the control of intracellular pathogens, including viruses. RNA derived from Sendai virus defective viral genomes (DVGs) stimulates RIG-Ilike receptor signaling leading to type-I immunity during infection. Here, we investigated whether a 268nt DVG-derived oligonucleotide (DDO) functions as a strong type-I immunity-inducing adjuvant during vaccination against influenza virus. We show that DDO induces robust IgG2c antibody production when used in an inactivated influenza A virus (IAV) vaccine. Additionally, DDO induces Th1 and CD8(+) T-cell responses able to protect against heterosubtypic IAV challenge. Interestingly, DDO synergized with AddaVax and skewed the immune response towards type-1 immunity. The adjuvancy of DDO alone and in synergy with AddaVax was heavily dependent on type I interferon signaling. Our data support a critical role for type I interferon in the induction of type-I immune responses during vaccination and demonstrate that DDO is a type-I immunity orienting vaccine adjuvant that can be used alone or in synergy with other adjuvants.

AB Background: Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination at birth may cause mild and benign local adverse effects (AE). More serious AE are rarely reported.
   Objective: To describe clinical features and outcomes of BCG (Tokyo-172 strain)-induce diseases (BCG-ID) that required medical attention at a tertiary care center in Bangkok, Thailand.
   Method: We retrospectively reviewed medical records from January 2007 to December 2016 that were selected by ICD-10 codes. The inclusion criteria were the patients under 3 years of age who developed lymphadenitis, osteitis, or disseminated infections of which BCG was a possible pathogen. Cases were classified into suspected (clinically compatible without laboratory confirmation), probable (suspected cases with M. tuberculosis complex identified), and confirmed BCG-ID (probable cases with molecular confirmation of M. bovis BCG strain).
   Results: 95 children were identified; 57 (60.0%) were male, and the median age at presenting symptom was 3.5 (range: 0.6-28.7) months. Of these, 25 (26.3%) were suspected, 49 (51.6%) were probable, and 21 (22.1%) were confirmed BCG-ID. Overall, 87 (92%) children had regional lymphadenitis corresponding to the BCG site, 5 (5%) had osteitis, and 3 (3%) had disseminated BCG. Of those with lymphadenitis, average size was 2.2 (range 0.7-5) cm. in diameter and 53% (46/87) had pulmonary involvement. Five children with immunodeficiency; three had disseminated BCG and two had lymphadenitis. Eight (9.2%) patients with lymphadenitis underwent needle aspiration; 57 (65.5%) had surgical excision. All children with BCG osteitis underwent surgical intervention in combination with anti-tuberculosis treatment. One patient with osteitis experienced long-term leg length discrepancy.
   Conclusion: Regional lymphadenitis was the most common feature of BCG-ID requiring medical attention. That none of the BCG osteitis were immunocompromised hosts suggested the potential virulence of BCG in neonates. A systematic national surveillance and reporting system is needed to develop accurate estimates of population incidence and support development of effective vaccine policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Implementation of maternal influenza immunization in El Salvador:
   Experiences and lessons learned from a mixed-methods study

AB Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries prioritize pregnant women for influenza vaccination, yet few low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) have implemented maternal influenza immunization programs. To inform vaccine decision-making and operational planning in LMICs, there is a need to document and share experiences from countries that provide seasonal influenza vaccine to pregnant women, particularly those with high coverage, like El Salvador.
   Methods: In 2015 and 2016, PATH and country researchers conducted a mixed-methods study to document the experience and lessons learned from maternal influenza immunization delivery and acceptance in El Salvador as part of a collaborative effort between WHO and PATH. Researchers conducted focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, antenatal clinic exit interviews, and key informant interviews with 326 participants from two municipalities in each of the country's three regions. Respondents included pregnant and recently pregnant women, family members, community leaders, health personnel, public health managers and partners, and policymakers.
   Results: Factors perceived as positively influencing maternal influenza immunization delivery and acceptance in El Salvador include the use of multiple vaccine delivery strategies, targeted education and community engagement efforts, and a high degree of trust between the community and health care providers. Influenza vaccine acceptance by pregnant women is high and has improved over time, largely attributed to education targeting health care advisors. Perceived challenges to pregnant women receiving health care and vaccination include the need for permission to attend services and limited access to health services in insecure areas related to the presence of criminal gang activity.
   Conclusions: We identified approaches and barriers perceived to affect maternal influenza vaccine delivery in El Salvador. This information will be useful to public health decision-makers and implementers in El Salvador and other countries considering introduction of new maternal vaccines or striving to increase coverage of vaccines currently provided.

AB Background: People with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are highly susceptible to influenza related morbidity and mortality. In order to assess comparative efficacy of influenza vaccine strategies among HIV-positive people, we performed a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA).
   Methods: In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL between 1946 and July 2015 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on influenza vaccines for HIV-positive adults reporting seroconversion or seroprotection outcomes. The NMAs were conducted within a Bayesian framework and logistic models were used for comparing the effect of the vaccine strategies on the two outcomes.
   Results: A total of 1957 publications were identified, 143 were selected for full review, and 13 RCTs were included in our final analysis. Fourteen separate NMAs were conducted by outcomes, vaccine strain, and different outcome measurement timepoints. For example, compared with the 15 mu g single vaccine strategy, the odds ratio was the highest for the adjuvant 7.5 mu g booster strategy (2.99 [95% credible interval 1.18-7.66]) when comparing seroconversion for HINT at 14-41 days after the last dose of vaccination and for the 60 mu g single strategy (2.33 [1.31-4.18]) when comparing seroconversion for strain B.
   Conclusions: The adjuvant 7.5 mu g booster and 60 mu gsingle vaccine strategies provided better seroconversion and seroprotection outcomes. These findings have important implications for national and international guidelines for influenza vaccination for HIV-positive people and future research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease, and hazardous to the poultry industry. Immune failure often occurs due to the emergence of new serotypes or field strains antigenically different from the vaccine strains. To prepare a candidate vaccine against the prevalent avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in China, the GI-19/QX-like field isolate Sczy3 was selected as the progenitor strain and attenuated via passaging in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells for 100 times. The 100th generation of CEK-adapted strain, designated SczyC100, was safe to use on one-day old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken as determined by pathogenicity and virulence reversion test. The efficacies of SczyC100 and two commonly used commercial vaccines (H120 and 4/91) against prevalent GI-19/QX and GI-7/1WI type virulent strains were evaluated. Sczy3C100 effectively reduced the morbidity, mortality, mean lesion scores (MLSs), and viral load of trachea of chickens challenged by GI-19/QX and GI-7/TWI strains. CEK-adapted SczyC100 is therefore a potential vaccine candidate for the control of IB in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human influenza viruses passaged in eggs often acquire mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding site (RBS). To determine if egg-adapted H1N1 vaccines commonly elicit antibodies targeting the egg-adapted RBS of HA, we completed hemagglutinin-inhibition assays with A/California/7/2009 HA and egg-adapted A/California/7/2009-X-179A HA using sera collected from 159 humans vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines during the 2015-16 season. We found that similar to 5% of participants had >= 4-fold higher antibody titers to the egg-adapted viral strain compared to wild type viral strain. We used reverse-genetics to demonstrate that a single egg-adapted HA RBS mutation (Q226R) was responsible for this phenotype. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Invasive meningococcal disease has a high burden in young children, particularly during infancy. We investigated the immunogenicity and safety of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugated vaccine (MenACWY-TT) co-administered with routine vaccines in healthy infants.
   Methods: In this phase IIIb study (NCT01340898) conducted in 2 centers in Lebanon and Mexico, 750 infants were randomized (2:1:1) to receive MenACWY-TT according to 3 schedules: 3+1 (at ages 2, 4, 6 and 15-18 months; group ACWY3+1); 1+1 (at 6 and 15-18 months; group ACWY1+1) or single-dose at 15-18 months (group ACWY1). All infants received PHiD-CV and DTPa-IPV/Hib at ages 2, 4, 6, 15-18 months. Immune responses to MenACWY-TT were assessed by rSBA and hSBA at 7 months (groups ACWY3+1, ACWY1+1) and pre- and post-vaccination at 15-18 months of age (all groups). Immune responses to co-administered vaccines, reactogenicity and safety were also evaluated.
   Results: Immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT at 1 month post-primary vaccination was demonstrated in group ACWY3+1: the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the percentage of infants with rSBA titers >= 8 was >80% for each serogroup. At 7 months of age, >= 93.9% of MeriACWY-TT-primed infants had rSBA titers >= 8. Post-MenACWY-TT vaccination at age 15-18 months, >= 96.3% of participants in all groups had rSBA titers >= 8, regardless of the number of doses received previously. The percentage of infants with hSBA titers >= 4 were >= 87.2% and >= 89.7% at post-primary and booster/single-dose vaccination, respectively. Immune responses to PHiD-CV and DTPa-IPV/Hib did not seem impacted by coadministration with MenACWY-TT in infancy. The incidence of all adverse events was similar among groups. Serious adverse events were reported for 63/750 children in all groups; none were considered vaccine-related by investigators.
   Conclusion: Primary vaccination with 3 or 1 dose(s) of MenACWY-TT when co-administered with routine pediatric vaccines in infants is immunogenic and well-tolerated. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Half of all new human papillomavirus (HPV) infections occur in adolescents and young adults, and this population has poor HPV vaccination rates. Rural areas of the U.S. have high rates of HPV-related diseases and low vaccination rates as well. The purpose of this study was to determine the perceived barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination among adolescents and their caregivers in rural south Alabama.
   Methods: Vaccinated and non-vaccinated adolescents ages 11-18 years old and primary caregivers were recruited from three rural counties in south Alabama. Participants completed individual interviews to discuss perceived barriers to vaccination and factors influencing their decision to vaccinate. Discussion groups were held to determine potential solutions to barriers elucidated from the interviews. Interview and discussion group transcripts were analyzed, and themes were identified.
   Results: Approximately 62.5% of adolescents had not initiated the HPV vaccine series. Of those adolescents who started the vaccine series (n = 9, 37.5%), about half completed it (n = 5). Few participants in this study reported speaking with their health care provider (HCP) about the vaccine in the past year. Lack of information about the vaccine, its side effects, and no HCP recommendation were common barriers cited by non-vaccinators. Facilitators to vaccination included cancer prevention, discussion with HCP, and peer testimonials. Potential solutions to barriers were also discussed.
   Conclusions: Proposed strategies to increase HPV vaccination were similar between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. Education about HPV and the HPV vaccine is needed throughout these rural south Alabama communities to ensure informed decisions are made about vaccination and to increase vaccination rates.

AB All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) up-regulates, in laboratory animals, the expression of the gut homing markers alpha 4 beta 7 integrin and CCR9 on lymphocytes, increasing their gut tropism. Here, we show that, in healthy adult volunteers, ATRA induced an increase of these gut homing markers on T cells in vivo in a time dependent manner. The coordinated increase of alpha 4 beta 7 and CCR9 by ATRA was seen in 57% (12/21) of volunteers and only when given together with an oral Vivotif vaccine. When this coordinated response to ATRA and Vivotif vaccine was present, it was strongly correlated with the gut immunoglobulin A (IgA) specific response to vaccine LPS (p = 0.82: P = 0.02). Using RNA-Seq analysis of whole blood transcription, patients receiving ATRA and Vivotif in conjunction showed transcriptomic changes in immune-related pathways, particularly including interferon alpha/beta signaling pathway, membrane-ECM interactions and immune hubs. These results suggest that exogenous ATRA can be used to manipulate responses to a subclass of oral vaccines, so far limited to a live attenuated Vivotif vaccine. (C) 2018 The Authors.

   ASSOCIATION
AB Background: Recent studies indicate that there is selection bias for transmission of viral polymorphisms associated with higher viral fitness. Furthermore, after transmission and before a specific immune response is mounted in the recipient, the virus undergoes a number of reversions which allow an increase in their replicative capacity. These aspects, and others, affect the viral population characteristic of early acute infection.
   Methods: 160 single gag-gene amplifications were obtained by limiting-dilution RT-PCR from plasma samples of 8 ARV-naive patients with early acute infection (<30 days, 22 days average) and 8 ARV-naive patients with approximately a year of infection (10 amplicons per patient). Sanger sequencing and NGS SMRT technology (Pacific Biosciences) were implemented to sequence the amplicons. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using MEGA 6.06. HLA-I (A and B) typing was performed by SSOP-PCR method. The chromatograms were analyzed with Sequencher 4.10. Epitopes and immuneproteosomal cleavages prediction was performed with CBS prediction server for the 30 HLA-A and -B alleles most prevalent in our population with peptide lengths from 8 to 14 mer. Cytotoxic response prediction was performed by using IEDB Analysis Resource.
   Results: After implementing epitope prediction analysis, we identified a total number of 325 possible viral epitopes present in two or more acute or chronic patients. 60.3% (n = 196) of them were present only in acute infection (prevalent acute epitopes) while 39.7% (n =129) were present only in chronic infection (prevalent chronic epitopes). Within p24, the difference was equally dramatic with 59.4% (79/133) being acute epitopes (p < 0.05). This is consistent with progressive viral adaptation to immune response in time and further supported by the fact that cytotoxic responses prediction showed that acute epitopes are more likely to generate immune response than chronic epitopes. Interestingly, only 27.5% of acute epitopes match the population-level consensus sequence of the virus.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that certain non-consensus viral residues might be transmitted more frequently than consensus-residues when located in immunological relevant positions (epitopes). This observation might be relevant to the rationale behind development of an effective vaccine to reduce viral reservoir and induce functional cure of HIV infection based in prevalent acute epitopes.

AB Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have recently expanded their range in the world and caused serious and widespread outbreaks of near pandemic proportions. There are no licensed vaccines that protect against these co-circulating viruses that are transmitted by invasive mosquito vectors. We report here on the development of a single-dose, bivalent experimental vaccine for CHIKV and ZIKV. This vaccine is based on a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses the CHIKV envelope polyprotein (E3-E2-6K-E1) in place of the VSV glycoprotein (G) and also expresses the membrane-envelope (ME) glycoproteins of ZIKV. This vaccine induced neutralizing antibody responses to both CHIKV and ZIKV in wild-type mice and in interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice, animal models for CHIKV and ZIKV infection. A single vaccination of A129 mice with the vector protected these mice against infection with both CHIKV and ZIKV. Our single-dose vaccine could provide durable, low-cost protection against both CHIKV and ZIKV for people traveling to or living in areas where both viruses are circulating, which include most tropical regions in the world.

DE Keywords:; Dengue; Vaccine; Tetravalent; Low-dose; Intradermal
ID RECOMBINANT; ADULTS; VIRUS
AB Background: As part of the ongoing search for an effective dengue vaccine, Takeda performed a phase 1b study to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of an early low-dose tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate formulation (LD-TDV), based on an attenuated serotype 2 backbone, when administered intradermally with an injector device (Pharmajet (R)), or needle-syringe.
   Methods: The study was performed in two centers in the US, in healthy 18-45 year old subjects with no history of dengue vaccination or disease. One or two vaccine doses were given on Day 0, and another dose or placebo on Day 90. Neutralizing antibodies were measured up to Day 270; safety was assessed as laboratory measurements and solicited and unsolicited adverse events on diary cards.
   Results: Changes in World Health Organization prequalification guidance for new vaccines concerning storage conditions favored the use of lyophilized preparations, and led to the early cessation of enrolment, but not before 67 subjects were enrolled in four treatment groups. Sixty-five subjects completed the planned schedule. There were no safety signals or serious adverse events. All vaccination regimens elicited neutralizing antibodies. Titers of neutralizing antibodies against serotypes 1 and 2 were higher than those against serotypes 3 and 4. There were no consistent increases in responses with two doses given either concomitantly or 90 days apart.
   Conclusions: Simultaneous injection of two LD-TDV doses was shown to have the potential to improve seroconversion rates to serotypes 1 and 2, and to increase serotype 2 antibody titers. A primary dose of LD-TDV administered by Pharmajet was shown to induce more rapid seroconversion to serotypes 1, 2, and 3 compared with administration by needle-syringe (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01765426).

AB In 2016, the live attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax, Merck and Co, USA) was introduced into the Australian National Immunisation Program for people aged 70 years who are not significantly immunocompromised. We report the administration of Zostavax in an immunocompromised patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and no evidence of primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. The patient presented with a bilateral vesicular facial rash 22 days after receiving Zostavax and was initially managed as an outpatient with oral acyclovir. He re-presented three days later and was diagnosed with disseminated VZV infection complicated by meningoencephalitis. The patient died following cardiac arrest on day 10 of hospitalisation. This unfortunate case highlights the challenge of safely implementing a high titre live vaccine in a population where contraindications are prevalent. The non-live recombinant herpes zoster subunit vaccine (Shingrix, GSK) may provide a safe and effective option to protect immunocompromised patients from shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia.

AB Objective: To compare timely birth dose (TBD) coverage of hepatitis B vaccine and socio-economic inequality distribution of TBD coverage between 2011 and 2016 in rural areas of western China.
   Methods: In western China, using multi-stage probability proportion to size sampling, 2633 and 1929 children aged 0-35 months with an immunization card were selected from 14 rural counties in 2011 and 2016, respectively. Socio-economic characteristics were obtained from face-to-face questionnaire survey and copies of vaccination certificates. We performed multivariate logistic regression models to identify the determinants of TBD coverage of hepatitis B vaccine. We grouped TBD coverage by wealth quintiles, calculated inequality using the difference base on coverage in richest (quintile 5) and poorest (quintile 1) household wealth quintiles.
   Findings: From 2011 to 2016, the overall TBD coverage of hepatitis B vaccine among children aged 0-35 months in rural areas of western China increased from 52.8% (95% confidence interval, Cl: 42.4-62.8) to 80.2% (95% Cl: 69.5-87.8). The absolute difference in TBD coverage between richest and poorest quintiles was 20.6 (95%CI: 9.4-31.8) and 15.8 (95%CI: 1.4-30.2) in 2011 and 2016, respectively.
   Conclusion: The socioeconomic inequality in TBD coverage decreased over the study period, but such inequality still existed in 2016. To improve inequality in TBD, the government should pay more attention to the disadvantaged groups, especially the children who were delivered at home, or whose caregivers were ethnic minority or who have a lower level of education.

AB Several types of avian influenza virus (AIV) vaccines exist, including live-attenuated, vectored, and whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines. Inactivated vaccines offer some advantages compared to other types of vaccines, including ease of production and lack of ability to revert to a virulent state. However, WIV are poorly immunogenic, especially when these vaccines are delivered to mucosal surfaces. There are several factors that contribute to the immunogenicity of vaccines, one of which is the method used to inactivate viruses. Several methods exist for producing influenza WIVs, including formaldehyde, a chemical that affects protein structures leading to virus inactivation. Other methods include treatment with betapropiolactone (BPL) and the application of gamma radiation, both of which have less effects on protein structures compared to formaldehyde, and instead alter nucleic acids in the virion. Here, we sought to determine the effect of the above inactivation methods on immunogenicity of AIV vaccines. To this end, chickens were vaccinated with three different H9N2 WIVs using formaldehyde, BPL, and gamma radiation for inactivation. In addition to administering these three WIVs alone as vaccines, we also included CpG ODN 2007, a synthetic ligand recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR)21 in chickens, as an adjuvant for each WIV. Subsequently, antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses were measured following vaccination. Antibody-mediated immune responses were increased in chickens that received the BPL and Gamma WIVs compared to the formaldehyde WIV. CpG ODN 2007 was found to significantly increase antibody responses for each WIV compared to WIV alone. Furthermore, we observed the presence of cell-mediated immune responses in chickens that received the BPL WIV combined with CpG ODN 2007. Based on these results, the BPL WIV + CpG ODN 2007 combination was the most effective vaccine at inducing adaptive immune responses against H9N2 AIV. Future studies should characterize mucosal adaptive immune responses to these vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Newcastle disease (ND), caused by virulent class II avian paramyxovirus 1 (Newcastle disease virus, NDV), occurs sporadically in poultry despite their having been immunized with commercial vaccines. These vaccines were all derived from NDV strains isolated around 70 years ago. Since then, class II NDV strains have evolved into 18 genotypes. Whether the vaccination failure results from genotype mismatches between the currently used vaccine strains and field-circulating velogenic strains or from an impaired immune response in the vaccination remains unclear. To test the first hypothesis, we performed a heterologous genotype II vaccine/genotype XI challenge in one-day old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks and reproduced viral shedding. We then produced two attenuated strains of genotype II and XI by reverse genetics and used them to immunize two-week old SPF chickens that were subsequently challenged with velogenic strains of genotypes II, VII and XI. We found that both vaccines could induce antibodies with hemagglutination inhibition titers higher than 6.5 log(2). Vaccination also completely prevented disease, viral shedding in swabs, and blocked viral replication in tissues from different genotypes in contrast to unvaccinated chickens that died shortly after challenge. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that, in immunocompetent poultry, genotype mismatch is not the main reason for vaccination failure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and N. gonorrhoeae (Ng) express a Macrophage Infectivity Potentiator (M1P, NMB1567/NEIS1487) protein in their outer membrane (OM). In this study, we prepared independent batches of liposomes (n = 3) and liposomes + MonoPhosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA) (n = 3) containing recombinant truncated Nm-MlP protein encoded by Allele 2 (rT-Nm-MIP, amino acids 22-142), and used these to immunize mice. We tested the hypothesis that independent vaccine batches showed similar antigenicity, and that antisera could recognise both meningococcal and gonococcal MIP and induce cross-species bactericidal activity.
   The different batches of M2 rT-Nm-MIP-liposomes +/- MPLA showed no significant (P > 0.05) batch-to-batch variation in antigenicity. Anti-rT-Nm-MlP sera reacted equally and specifically with Nm-MIP and Ng-MIP in OM and on live bacterial cell surfaces. Specificity was shown by no antiserum reactivity with Amip bacteria. Using human complement/serum bactericidal assays, anti-M2 rT-Nm-MIP sera killed homologous meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) strains (median titres of 32-64 for anti-rT-Nm-MIP-liposome sera; 128-256 for anti-rT-Nm-MIP-liposome + MPLA sera) and heterologous Ml proteinexpressing MenB strains (titres of 64 for anti rT-Nm-MIP-liposome sera; 128-256 for anti-rT-Nm-MIP-liposome + MPLA sera). Low-level killing (P < 0.05) was observed for a MenB isolate expressing M7 protein (titres 4-8), but MenB strains expressing M6 protein were not killed (titre < 4-8). Killing (P < 0.05) was observed against MenC and MenW bacteria expressing homologous M2 protein (titres of 8-16) but not against MenA or MenY bacteria (titres < 4-8).
   Antisera to M2 rT-Nm-MIP showed significant (P < 0.05) cross-bactericidal activity against gonococcal strain P9-17 (expressing M35 Ng-MIP, titres of 64-512) and strain 12CFX_T_003 (expressing M10 Ng-MIP, titres 8-16) but not against FA1090 (expressing M8 Ng-MIP).
   As an alternative to producing recombinant protein, we engineered successfully the Nm-OM to express M2 Truncated-Nm-MIP, but lipooligosaccharide-extraction with Na-DOC was contra-indicated. Our data suggest that a multi-component vaccine containing a select number of Nm- and Ng-MIP type proteins would be required to provide broad coverage of both pathogens.

AB Purpose: Vaccines recommended for adolescents are considered safe and effective, however administration may occasionally result in acute pain at the injection site or syncope (fainting). These adverse effects pose a risk to patient safety and are potential barriers to adherence to future vaccinations. We assessed a novel intervention designed to help prevent acute pain and syncope associated with adolescent vaccinations.
   Methods: We conducted a 3-month pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a vaccination comfort menu within two Kaiser Permanente Northwest pediatric clinics. The menu offered a variety of comfort items (e.g.,cold packs, squeeze balls) that children could select prior to their vaccination. We surveyed parents of recently vaccinated adolescents and interviewed providers to assess the implementation and effectiveness of the intervention.
   Results: Response rate for the parent survey was 33% (378/1136). Only 20% of the parents reported that their provider offered the comfort menu during the vaccination visit. Approximately 50% of the adolescents who were offered the menu selected a comfort item and most of these participants reported that the item was very (35%) or somewhat (38%) helpful in improving their vaccination experience. Per provider interviews, common barriers to implementing the intervention included lack of time and convenience, and the brevity of the pilot period.
   Conclusions: The comfort menu may improve the vaccination experience of youth and increase the likelihood of adherence with future vaccinations. However, only 20% of the parents reported that their provider offered the menu during the vaccination visit. Additional research is needed to determine the feasibility of implementing this intervention on a larger scale, as well as assessing whether the intervention has a significant impact on reducing adverse events.

AB Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan that can invade all eukaryotic cells and infect all warm-blood animals, causing the important zoonosis toxoplasmosis. Invasion of host cells is the key step necessary for T. gondii to complete its life cycle and microneme proteins play an important role in attachment and invasion of host cells. Microneme protein 16 (TgMIC16) is a new protective protein in T. gondii and belongs to transmembrane microneme proteins (TM-MIC). The TM-MICs are released onto the parasite's surface as complexes capable of interacting with host cell receptors. In the present study, we expressed the TgMIC16 protein on the surface of Saccharomyce cerevisiae (pCTCON2-TgMIC16/EBY100) and evaluated it as a potential vaccine for BALB/c mice against challenge infection with the RH strain of T. gondii. We immunized BALB/c mice both orally and intraperitoneally. After three immunizations, the immune response was evaluated by measuring antibody levels, lymphocyte proliferative responses, percentages of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, cytokine production, and the survival times of challenged mice. The results showed that the pCTCON2-TgMIC16/EBY100 vaccine stimulated humoral and cellular immune responses. In addition, mice immunized with the pCTCON2-TgMIC16/EBY100 vaccine showed increased survival times compared with non-immunized controls. In summary, TgMIC16 displayed on the cell surface of S. cerevisiae could be used as potential vaccine against toxoplasmosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Escherichia coli 0157:H7 is a zoonotic pathogen of global importance and the serotype of Shiga toxinproducing E. coli (STEC) most frequently associated with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in humans. The main STEC reservoir is cattle. Vaccination of calves with the carboxy-terminal fraction of Intimin gamma (IntC280) and EspB can reduce E. coli 0157:H7 fecal shedding after experimental challenge. Shiga toxin (Stx) exerts local immunosuppressive effects in the bovine intestine and Stx2B fused to Brucella lumazine synthase (BLS-Stx2B) induces Stx2-neutralizing antibodies. To determine if an immune response against Stx could improve a vaccine's effect on fecal shedding, groups of calves were immunized with EspB + IntC280, with EspB + IntC280 + BLS-Stx2B, or kept as controls. At 24 days post vaccination calves were challenged with E. coli 0157:H7. Shedding of E. coli 0157:H7 was assessed in recto-anal mucosal swabs by direct plating and enrichment followed by immunomagnetic separation and multiplex PCR. Calves were euthanized 15 days after the challenge and intestinal segments were obtained to assess mucosal antibodies. Vaccination induced a significant increase of IntC280 and EspB specific antibodies in serum and intestinal mucosa in both vaccinated groups. Antibodies against Stx2B were detected in serum and intestinal mucosa of animals vaccinated with 3 antigens. Sera and intestinal homogenates were able to neutralize Stx2 verocytotoxicity compared to the control and the 2-antigens vaccinated group. Both vaccines reduced E. coli 0157:H7 shedding compared to the control group. The addition of Stx2B to the vaccine formulation did not result in a superior level of protection compared to the one conferred by lntC280 and EspB alone. It remains to be determined if the inclusion of Stx2B in the vaccine alters E. coli 0157:H7 shedding patterns in the long term and after recurrent low dose exposure as occurring in cattle herds.

AB Background: Seasonal influenza is responsible for a large disease and economic burden. Despite the expanding recommendation of influenza vaccination, influenza has continued to be a major public health concern in the United States (U.S.). To evaluate influenza prevention strategies it is important that policy makers have current estimates of the economic burden of influenza.
   Objective: To provide an updated estimate of the average annual economic burden of seasonal influenza in the U.S. population in the presence of vaccination efforts.
   Methods: We evaluated estimates of age-specific influenza-attributable outcomes (ill-non medically attended, office-based outpatient visit, emergency department visits, hospitalizations and death) and associated productivity loss. Health outcome rates were applied to the 2015 U.S. population and multiplied by the relevant estimated unit costs for each outcome. We evaluated both direct healthcare costs and indirect costs (absenteeism from paid employment) reporting results from both a healthcare system and societal perspective. Results were presented in five age groups (<5 years, 5-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years and >= 65 years of age).
   Results: The estimated average annual total economic burden of influenza to the healthcare system and society was $11.2 billion ($6.3-$25.3 billion). Direct medical costs were estimated to be $3.2 billion ($1.5-$11.7 billion) and indirect costs $8.0 billion ($4.8-$13.6 billion). These total costs were based on the estimated average numbers of (1) ill-non medically attended patients (21.6 million), (2) officebased outpatient visits (3.7 million), (3) emergency department visit (0.65 million) (4) hospitalizations (247.0 thousand), (5) deaths (36.3 thousand) and (6) days of productivity lost (20.1 million).
   Conclusions: This study provides an updated estimate of the total economic burden of influenza in the U.S. Although we found a lower total cost than previously estimated, our results confirm that influenza is responsible for a substantial economic burden in the U.S. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Co-administration of vaccines in adolescents may improve coverage. We assessed co-administration of quadrivalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid-conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT), human papillomavirus 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (AS04-HPV16/18) and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) in girls and young women.
   Methods: In this phase IIIb study (NCT01755689), 1300 healthy 9-25-year-old females were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to receive: MenACWY-TT at month (M) 0 and AS04-HPV16/18 at Ml, M2, M7; MenACWY-TT and AS04-HPV16/18 at MO and AS04-HPV16/18 at Ml, M6; AS04-HPV16/18 at MO, Ml, M6; MenACWY-TT, Tdap and AS04-HPV16/18 at MO and AS04-HPV16/18 at Ml, M6; Tdap and AS04-HPV16/18 at MO and AS04-HPV16/18 at Ml, M6. Immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity were evaluated.
   Results: Immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT and AS04-HPV16/18 when co-administered was non-inferior to that of the 2 vaccines given separately. Co-administration of MenACWY-TT, AS04-HPV16/18 and Tdap was non-inferior to MenACWY-TT administered alone or to Tdap co-administered with AS04-HPV16/18 in terms of immunogenicity for all vaccine components, except pertussis antigens. Post-vaccination, >= 89.5% of participants reached antibody levels above the pre-specified threshold for all antigens. No safety concerns were identified.
   Conclusion: Our data support co-administration of MenACWY-TT with Tdap and AS04-HPV16/18 vaccines in adolescents. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: In 2013, pertussis immunization (Tdap) for pregnant women was implemented in Colombia to protect newborns in response to increased pertussis incidence.
   Objective: To assess the effect of Tdap maternal immunization on the concentration of mother/umbilical cord antibodies and the occurrence of pertussis in infants during their first six months of life.
   Methods: A cohort study in eight randomly selected hospitals in Medellin and metropolitan area of Antioquia, Colombia was conducted in 2015-2016. IgG PT antibody levels in paired maternal and umbilical cord sera were measured from 805 mothers immunized recruited during labor and 200 mothers recruited during the prenatal care before immunization and followed until delivery. Antibodies were analyzed by commercial ELISA kits. 896 infants were followed to detect acute respiratory infections and paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whoop, apnea, cyanosis or post-tussive vomiting. For laboratory confirmation, B. pertussis- specific real time PCR was performed.
   Results: We observed a high prevalence of titers >100 IU/mL (mother: 18.40% [95% Cl 16-21%]; umbilical cord: 23.1% [95% Cl 19.2-27.4%]), positive correlation of umbilical cord and maternal antibodies, higher antibody concentration in vaccinated than in non-vaccinated mothers and significant difference in antibody levels before and after vaccination (Wilcoxon test p = 0.000). The trans placental transport ratio was higher if the mother was vaccinated between 26 and 30 weeks of pregnancy and maximum eight weeks before delivery. Two cases of pertussis were confirmed in infants (incidence of 1.99 per 1000).
   Conclusion: The expected effect of Tdap maternal vaccination against pertussis was observed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Genomic and transcriptomic sequences of Tagetes erecta are very limited in public databases, despite its nutritional and economical value. In this study, nine cDNA libraries were constructed from leaves, immature and mature flowers and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2000. Over 45.66 Gb nucleotides were generated and a total of 72,499 unigenes were assembled, 34,892 (48.13%) of which were annotated in NR, Swiss-prot, COG, GO, KOG, KEGG and Pfam. 11,721 differentially expressed genes were identified in leaves, immature flowers and mature flowers. The differentially expressed genes between immature flowers and mature flowers were mainly involved in photosynthesis and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Additionally, the catalysis-related unigenes and their expression involved in carotenoids biosynthesis were determined. Using our newly identified reference genes as internal control, the expression profiles of carotenoids biosynthetic genes were verified by real-time qRT-PCR, and four of the unigenes were cloned for full length sequences confirmation. Furthermore, gene expansions occurred among the catalytic gene families in carotenoids biosynthesis pathway, which might explain the high pigment content in T. erecta.

AB The present study investigated the genetic diversities of 30 autosomal insertion and deletion (InDel) loci of Investigator DIPplex kit (Qiagen) in Chinese Salar ethnic minority and explored the genetic relationships between the studied Salar group and other populations. The allelic frequencies of deletion alleles at the 30 InDel loci were in the range of 0.1739 (HLD64) to 0.8478 (HLD39). The discrimination power, polymorphism information content and probability of exclusion ranged from 0.4101 (HLD39) to 0.6447 (HLD136), 0.2247 (HLD39) to 0.3750 (HLD92) and 0.0400 (HLD39) to 0.2806 (HLD92), respectively. The observed and expected heterozygosity were in the range of 0.2348 (HLD39) to 0.5913 (HLD92), and 0.2580 (HLD39) to 0.5000 (HLD92), respectively. The cumulative discrimination power and probability of exclusion of the 30 loci reached 0.999999999993418 and 0.99039, respectively. The results of population genetic differentiation comparisons revealed that Salar group had similar allele distributions with Qinghai Tibetan, Xibe and Yi groups. Population Bayesian cluster analysis showed that there were similar ancestry components between Salar group and most Chinese populations. Besides, the principal components analysis and phylogenetic reconstructions further indicated that Salar group had intimate genetic relationships with Qinghai Tibetan and Xibe groups. In short, the results of the current studies indicated the genetic distributions of the 30 InDel loci in Salar group were relatively high genetic polymorphisms, which could be used in forensic individual identifications and as a supplementary tool for complex paternity testing.

AB The efficiency of current methods for industrial production of citric acid is limited. To achieve continuous citric acid production with enhanced yield and reduced cost, immobilized fermentation was employed in an Aspergillus niger 831 repeated fed-batch fermentation system. We developed a new type of material (PAF201), which was used as a carrier for the novel adsorption immobilization system. Hydrophobicity, pore size and concentration of carriers were researched in A. niger immobilization. The efficiency of the A. niger immobilization process was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Then eight-cycle repeated fed-batch cultures for citric acid production were carried out over 600 h, which showed stable production with maximum citric acid concentrations and productivity levels of 162.7 g/L and 2.26 g L-1 h(-1), respectively. Compared with some other literatures about citric acid yield, PAF201 immobilization system is 11.3% higher than previous results. These results indicated that use of the new adsorption immobilization system could greatly improve citric acid productivity in repeated fed-batch fermentation. Moreover, these results could provide a guideline for A. niger or other filamentous fungi immobilization in industry.

AB Although there is a great need for suitable vascular replacements in clinical practice, much progress needs to be made toward the development of a fully functional tissue-engineered construct. We propose a fabrication method of engineered tubular tissue for small blood vessels via a layer-by-layer cellular assembly technique using mouse smooth muscle cells, the construction of a poly-(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) (PLCL) scaffold, and integration in a microfluidic perfusion culture system. The cylindrical PLCL scaffold is incised, expanded, and its surface is laminated with the cell layers. The construct confirms into tubular structures due to residual stress imposed by the cylindrical PLCL scaffold. The perfusion culture system allows simulation of static, perfusion (laminar flow), and perfusion with pulsatile pressure (Pulsatile flow) conditions in which mimicking the in vivo environments. The aim of this evaluation was to determine whether fabricated tubular tissue models developed their mechanical properties. The cellular response to hemodynamic stimulus imposed by the dynamic culture system is monitored through expression analysis of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, elastin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chains isoforms transcription factors, which play an important role in tissue elastogenesis. Among the available materials for small blood vessel construction, these cellular hybrid vascular scaffolds hold much potential due to controllability of the mechanical properties of synthetic polymers and biocompatibility of integrated cellular components.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional gene regulators and that play vital roles controlling lipid metabolism. miR-205 is an important miRNA related to adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. However, little is known about the potential role of miR-205-5p in genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT, Oreochromis niloticus). In this study, we used miRanda software to search for potential miR-205-5p target genes and found a lipid-metabolism-related gene called acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACAC beta). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data indicated that there may be a negative regulation relationship between miR 205-5p and ACAC beta gene expression under HFD rearing. Using luciferase reporter assays, we verified the binding site of miR-205-5p in the 3'-untranslated region of the ACAC beta mRNA. Furthermore, an in vivo functional analysis of miR 205 5p was performed by injecting GIFT juveniles with a miR-205-5p antagomir. Reduced levels of miR-205-5p in GIFT liver increased ACAC beta mRNA expression 12 h post-injection. miR-205-5p suppression also increased fatty acid synthase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha mRNA levels 48 h and 120 h post-injection, respectively. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-205-5p negative regulates hepatic ACAC beta mRNA expression, and may serve as an important regulator in controlling hepatic lipid metabolism in GIFT.

AB Type II restriction endonucleases and modification DNA-methyltransferases are key instruments of genetic engineering. Recently the number of proteins assigned to this group exceeds 8500. Subtype IIC organizes bifunctional endonuclease-methyltransferase enzymes and currently consists of 16 described members. Here we present phylogenetic tree of 22 new potential bifunctional endonucleases. The majority of them are thought to be fusions of a restriction nuclease with a DNA-methyltransferase and a target recognition subunit of type I restriction-modification systems (R-M-S structure). A RM.AloI isoschizomer from Prevotella copri DSM-18205, Pcol, has been cloned, purified and its REase activity demonstrated. It cuts DNA in magnesium-dependent manner and demonstrates high affinity to DNA, which probably reflects its mechanism of action. This work provides additional proves that gene fusion might play an important role in evolution of restriction-modification systems and other DNA-modifying proteins.

AB Biallelic UNC80 mutations cause infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic fades 2 (IHPRF2), which is characterized by hypotonia, developmental delay (DD)/intellectual disability (ID), intrauterine growth retardation, postnatal growth retardation and characteristic facial features. We report two unrelated Chinese patients with compound heterozygous UNC80 mutations inherited from their parents, as identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES). Mutations c.3719G > A (p.W1240*)/c.4926_4937del (p.N1643_L1646del) and c.4963C > T (p.R1655C)/c.8385C > G (p.Y2795*) were identified in patient 1 and patient 2, respectively. Although both patients presented with DD/ID and hypotonia, different manifestations also occurred. Patient 1 presented with infantile hypotonia, epilepsy and hyperactivity without growth retardation, whereas patient 2 presented with persistent hypotonia, growth retardation and self-injury without epilepsy. Furthermore, we herein summarize the genotypes and phenotypes of patients with UNC80 mutations reported in the literature, revealing that IHPRF2 is a phenotypically heterogeneous disease. Common facial dysmorphisms include a thin upper lip, a tented upper lip, a triangular face, strabismus and microcephaly. To some extent, the manifestations of IHPRF2 mimic those of Angelman syndrome (AS)-like syndromes.

AB Sperm malformation is one of the main reasons for male infertility, but the precise mechanisms of this process remain undiscovered. The major process of spermiogenesis is sperm head shaping. Cytoskeleton is a crucial unit in this process, as the acroplaxome and manchette are two kinds of momentous structures cooperated with various functional proteins to insure the formation of acrosome and nucleus. One is primarily formed by filamentous actin (F-actin) and responsible for transverse acrosome extension and concentration, another plays as the mainstay of nuclear deformation through circular arrangement of microtubules (MTs). We suspect that the acroplaxome alone cannot maintain such a spatial framework of the acrosome. Previous studies have also revealed that a nucleus without acrosome could not induce the formation of ectoplasmic specialization. In this review, we integrated most of the key proteins that have been proven to participate in the essential developmental steps of post-meiosis. We also propose that the ambient MTs of the acrosome might be emanated from the Golgi apparatus. They form a novel cytoskeleton termed acroframosome (AFS) to transport vesicles and proteins during acrosome biogenesis. The hypothesis of the acroframosome-acroplaxome-manchette (AAM) cytoskeletal system is likely to be the axis of head-to-tail spermiogenesis.

AB The small Mafs, MafF, MafG and MafK play critical roles in morphogenesis and homeostasis through associating with Cap "n" Collar family of transcription factors. In this study, we tried to identify a small Maf protein in the freshwater mussel Cristaria plicata. The MafK cDNA of C. plicata, designated as CpMafK, was cloned from the hemocytes using degenerate primers by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. The full length cDNA of CpMafK is 2170 bp, which includes an open reading frame of 570 bp, encoding 189 amino acids. CpMafK possesses four conserved domains and shows a low level (54-63%) of sequence similarity to small Mafs from other species. The results of Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that CpMafK mRNA was constitutively expressed in tissues, and the highest expression level was in hepatopancreas. After microcystin challenge, the expression levels of CpMafk mRNA were up-regulated in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. The cDNA of CpMafK was cloned into the plasmid pET-32, and the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). CpMafK could combine to the promoters of CpGST1 and CpGST2 with high-affinity in vitro. Therefore, CpMafK could regulate the expression of detoxification.

AB In this study, the systemic analyses of nucleotide, codon and amino acid usages for E2 gene of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were carried out for estimating its genetic features. The nucleotide usage pattern at the first codon position was strongly influenced by the overall nucleotide composition, while the nucleotide usage patterns at the second and third codon positions seemed to have little link to the overall nucleotide composition. The result indicated that the mutation pressure from nucleotide composition constraint was not the single evolutionary force for genetic features of BVDV E2 gene. Just 18 out of 59 synonymous codons were similar with synonymous codon usage patterns for E2 gene between BVDV1 and BVDV2, while all synonymous codons which contain CpG dinucleotides were selected at the low level by E2 gene, suggesting that this gene suppressed the usages of codons containing CpG dinucleotides to regulate E2 gene replicate and transcript efficiently and avoid immune response from infected hosts. Amino acid usage patterns of E2 protein were generally different between BVDV1 and BVDV2. The patterns of synonymous codon and amino acid usages for E2 gene might be caused by the equilibrium of evolutionary forces from virus and host. Our work gave new investigations into the role of host origin in the formations of synonymous codon/amino acid usages and the evolutionary trend of BVDV E2 gene. The genetic characteristics that codon/amino acid usages of E2 gene adapted to the internal environment of individual animals might assist in understanding the changes of genetics and antigenicity for newly emerging BVDV.

AB Functional analyses of noncoding RNAs have associated many micro RNAs (miRNA, miR) with various physiological processes, including proliferation, differentiation, development, cell metabolism, and apoptosis. Aberrant expression of miRNA and imbalance in their functions may lead to cellular aberration and different disease development, including cancer. In silico analysis of miRNA target prediction suggested that miR-148a possess a binding site in the 3' UTR of DNMT1 mRNA which can cause silencing of DNMT1 gene. Accordingly, we performed in vitro cell culture experiments to confirm the effect miR-148a on DNMT1 gene expression in prostate cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that there is a physical association between DNMT1 mRNA and miR-148a. We found that (i) ectopic expression of miR-148a induces programmed cell death and represses cell proliferation by targeting DNMT1; (ii) miR-148a gene is regulated by DNA methylation and DNMT1 in prostate cancer. We conclude that miR-148a is silenced by DNA methylation and ectopic expression of miR-148a suppresses DNMT1 expression and induced apoptotic genes expression in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells.

AB Cytoplasmic Male Sterility is maternally inherited trait in plants, characterized by failure to produce functional pollen during anther development. Anther development is modulated through the interaction of nuclear and mitochondrial genes. In the present study, differential gene expression of floral buds at the sporogenous stage (SS) and microsporocyte stage (MS) between CGMS and its fertile maintainer line of cotton plants was studied. A total of 320 significantly differentially expressed genes, including 20 down-regulated and 37 up-regulated in CGMS comparing with its maintainer line at the SS stage, as well as and 89 down-regulated and 4 up-regulated in CGMS compared to the fertile line at MS stage. Comparing the two stages in the same line, there were 6 down-regulated differentially expressed genes only induced in CGMS and 9 up-regulated differentially expressed gene only induced in its maintainer. GO analysis revealed essential genes responsible for pollen development, and cytoskeleton category show differential expression between the fertile and CGMS lines. Validation studies by qRT-PCR shows concordance with RNA-seq result. A set of novel SSRs identified in this study can be used in evaluating genetic relationships among cultivars, QTL mapping, and marker-assisted breeding. We reported aberrant expression of genes related to pollen exine formation, and synthesis of pectin lyase, myosine heavy chain, tubulin, actin-beta, heat shock protein and myeloblastosis (MYB) protein as targets for CMS in cotton. The results of this study contribute to basic information for future screening of genes and identification of molecular portraits responsible for CMS as well as to elucidate molecular mechanisms that lead to CMS in cotton.

AB To provide a resource for the splice sites (SS) of different species, we calculated the matrices of nucleotide compositions of about 38 million splice sites from > 1000 species/lineages. The matrices are enriched of a GGTAAGT (5'SS) or (Y)(6)N(C/t)AG(g/a)t (3'SS) overall; however, they are quite diverse among hundreds of species. The diverse matrices remain prominent even under sequence selection pressures, suggesting the existence of diverse constraints as well as U snRNAs and other spliceosomal factors and/or their interactions with the splice sites. Using an algorithm to measure and compare the splice site constraints across all species, we demonstrate their distinct differences quantitatively. As an example of the resource's application to answering specific questions, we confirm that high constraints of particular positions are significantly associated with transcriptome-wide, increased occurrences of alternative splicing when uncommon nucleotides are present. More interestingly, the abundance of alternative splicing in 16 species correlates with the average constraint index of splice sites in a bell curve. This resource will allow users to assess specific sequences/splice sites against the consensus of every Ensembl-annotated species, and to explore the evolutionary changes or relationship to alternative splicing and transcriptome diversity. Web-search or update features are also included.

AB Apis cerana cerana, an important endemic honey bee species in China, possesses valuable characteristics such as a sensitive olfactory system, good foraging ability, and strong resistance to parasitic mites. Here, we performed transcriptome sequencing of the antenna, the major chemosensory organ of the bee, using an Illumina sequencer, to identify typical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in adult worker bees of different ages, namely, T1 (1 day); T2 (10 days); T3 (15 days); and T4 (25 days). Surprisingly, the expression levels of DEGs changed significantly between the Ti period and the other three periods. All the DEGs were classified into 26 expression profiles by trend analysis. Selected trend clusters were analyzed, and valuable information on gene expression patterns was obtained. We found that the expression levels of genes encoding cuticle proteins declined after eclosion, while those of immunity-related genes increased. In addition, genes encoding venom proteins and major royal jelly proteins were enriched at the T2 stage; small heat shock proteins showed significantly higher expression at the T3 stage; and some metabolism-related genes were more highly expressed at the T4 stage. The DEGs identified in this study may serve as a valuable resource for the characterization of expression patterns of antennal genes in A. cerana cerana. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the relationship between labor division in social bees and gene function.

AB Molecular regulatory mechanism of heat stress response (HSR) in Ericaceae remains unknown. Here, we sought to identify HSR mechanisms in Rhododendron hainanense, a Ericaceae species, through a combination of physiological and transcriptomic studies. The levels of MDA, H2O2, Pro, SOD, CAT and APX in leaves of R. hainanense were analyzed to characterize a dramatic difference in varied temperature treatment. Also, three sequencing libraries, including one control and two heat stress (HS)-treated samples, were constructed for comparative transcriptomic analysis. By Illumina sequencing and Trinity strategy, 350 million clean reads (average length = 149 bp) was assembled into 183,486 unigenes. According to analysis of differential expression genes (DEGs), a total of 2658 DEGs were obtained. Moreover, a complex interaction network of 982 DEGs was established, of which master portions were comprised of 109 transcription factors (TFs). Importantly, integrated differential expression profiling, qRT-PCR and functional analysis, several TFs of R. hainanense (ABR1, IAA26, OBF1, LUX, SCL3, DIV, NAC29, NAC72 and TCP3) and their potential regulations for the crosstalk between hormonal signal and HSR were identified. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of HSR in R. hainanense, breeding cultivars with improved thermotolerance.

AB Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration increases every year. It is critical to understand the elevated CO2 response molecular mechanisms of plants using genomic techniques. Hippophae rhamnoides L. is a high stress resistance plant species widely distributed in Europe and Asia. However, the molecular mechanism of elevated CO2 response in H. rhamnoides has been limited. In this study, transcriptomic analysis of two sea buckthorn cultivars under different CO2 concentrations was performed, based on the next-generation illumina sequencing platform and de novo assembly. We identified 4740 differentially expressed genes in sea buckthorn response to elevated CO2 concentrations. According to the gene ontology (GO) results, photosystem I, photosynthesis and chloroplast thylakoid membrane were the main enriched terms in 'xiangyang' sea buckthorn. In 'zhongguo' sea buckthorn, photosynthesis was also the main significantly enriched term. However, the number of photosynthesis related differentially expressed genes were different between two sea buckthorn cultivars. Our GO and pathway analyses indicated that the expression levels of the transcription factors WRKY, MYB and NAC were significantly different between the two sea buckthorn cultivars. This study provides a reliable transcriptome sequence resource and is a valuable resource for genetic and genomic researches for plants under high CO2 concentration in the future.

AB Background: Allergic asthma is a chronically relapsing inflammatory airway disease with a complex patho-physiology.
   Aim: This study was undertaken to investigate the potential contribution of NOD2 signaling, proinflammatory cytokines, chitotriosidase (CHIT1) activity, oxidative stress and DNA damage to atopic asthma pathogenesis, as well as to explore their possible role as surrogate noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring asthma severity.
   Methods: Sixty patients with atopic bronchial asthma who were divided according to asthma severity into 40 mild-moderate, 20 severe atopic asthmatics, in addition to thirty age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. NOD2 expression in PBMCs was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. DNA damage indices were assessed by alkaline comet assay. Serum IgE, IL-17, IL-8 and 3-Nitrotyrosine levels were estimated by ELISA. Serum CHIT1and GST activities, as well as MDA levels, were measured.
   Results: NOD2 mRNA relative expression levels were significantly decreased in atopic asthmatic cases relative to controls with lower values among severe atopic asthmatics. On the other hand, IL-17 and IL-8 serum levels, CHIT1 activity, DNA damage indices and oxidative stress markers were significantly increased in atopic asthmatic cases relative to controls with higher values among severe atopic asthmatics. The change in these parameters correlated significantly with the degree of decline in lung function.
   Conclusion: The interplay between NOD2 signaling, proinflammatory cytokines, CHIT1 activity, heightened oxidative stress and DNA damage orchestrates allergic airway inflammation and thus contributing to the pathogenesis of atopic asthma. These parameters qualified for measurement as part of new noninvasive biomarker panels for monitoring asthma severity.

AB Steroid-induced avascular necrosis of femoral head (SANFH) occurs frequently in patients receiving high-dose steroid treatment for these underlying diseases. The target of this study is to investigate the effect of microRNA-320 (miR-320) on SANFH by targeting CYP1A2. CYP1A2 expression was detected using immunohistochemistry. Specimens were collected from patients with SANFH and femoral neck fracture. Seventy rats were assigned into seven groups. The targeting relationship between miR-320 and CYP1A2 was verified by bioinformatics website and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect miR-320 and CYP1A2 expressions. The enzymatic activity of CYP1A2 was detected by fluorescence spectrophotometry. Hemorheology and microcirculation were measured in rats. MiR-320 expression decreased and CYP1A2 expression and enzymatic activity increased in SANFH patients compared to those with femoral neck fracture. CYP1A2 was the target gene of miR-320. Hemorheology and microcirculation results showed that up-regulated expression of CYP1A2 promoted the development of SANFH while increased expression of miR-320 inhibited the development of SANFH. Compared with the SANFH group, the SANFH + miR-320 mimic group showed increased miRNA-320 expression, and decreased CYP1A2 expression and enzymatic activity. Opposite results were found in the SANFH + miR-320 inhibitor group. The SANFH + miR-320 inhibitor + pCR-CYP1A2_KO group showed decreased miRNA-320 expression and the SANFH + pCR-CYP1A2_KO group showed decreased CYP1A2 expression and enzymatic activity. Our findings provide evidences that miR-320 might inhibit the development of SANFH by targeting CYP1A2.

AB Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) as an important metabolic disorder is accompanied by dysregulation in lipid metabolism. Sterol regulatory element-binding factor-2 (SREBF-2) gene has a substantive role in lipid metabolism. Recently published report indicated the overexpression of this gene in diabetic patients. So, in this preliminary study we evaluated the effects of three common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1052717G/ A, rs2267439C/T, and rs2267443G/A in risk of T2D in a sample of Iranian population. Present case-control study consists of 250 patients with endocrinologically approved T2D and 250 healthy controls. The variants genotyped by using tetra amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (Tetra ARMS-PCR) method. The findings demonstrated that the rs2267439C/T polymorphism increased the risk of T2D in all measured inheritance models (Codominantl; p = 0.003, codominant2; p = 0.014, dominant; p < 0.0001, recessive; p = 0.037, over-dominant; p = 0.0025, and log-additive; p = 0.0048) while our results did not show statistically association between rs1052717G/A and rs2267443G/A SNPs and T2D development. The current investigation indicated that the rs2267439C/T polymorphism in the SREBF-2 gene increased the T2D susceptibility in an Iranian population. Further studies with different ethnicities and more extensive sample sizes are demanded to confirm our finding.

AB Background: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) with variable clinical presentations and heterogeneity is the common cause of sudden cardiac death. Genetic diagnosis is challenging in these complex diseases but exome sequencing as a genetic diagnostic tool provides explainable results.
   Methods: In a familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy with multigenerational inheritance with apparent phenotype, had a history of sudden death and severe arrhythmia followed by implantation of Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Exome sequencing (100 x) trailed by effective filtering steps for exome variants on the basis of different parameters, segregated variants are prioritized for the disease and further clinical relevance are evaluated for the variants.
   Results: A rare causal variant in troponin-T gene (TNNT2, NM_000364.3;c.274C > T;p.Arg92Trp) is identified, shared by only affected members, absent in unaffected members and also in 200 unrelated control chromosomes. TNNT2 mutation act as a driver mutation but mutations in other disease-related genes, KCNMB1, LPL, APOE and other biochemical factors provides risk stratification within affected family members.
   Conclusion: This study contributes to the role of "rare variants" in complex disease phenotypes and heterogeneity within family and the necessity of whole exome targeted approaches in complex cardiomyopathy, which are known to harbor private mutations.

AB Milk is a perfect source of nutrients for neonates. When breast feeding cannot be done, an infant's alimentation is usually initiated to cow's milk, among the primary foods. It has been reported that about 2.5% of juveniles under the age of 3 years manifest allergic reactions to cow's milk proteins. Among the cow's milk proteins, casein fractions are considered as the strongest allergenic proteins. The proteolytic enzymes of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), during fermentation of dairy products, can break down milk proteins especially caseins and subsequently reduce the immune reactivity of allergenic proteins. In this research, raw bovine and camel milk samples were screened for cocci LAB strains and after isolation, their proteolytic activity against bovine milk caseins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. The potential of cocci LAB strains on alpha(S1)-casein degradation and their potential to break down the principle allergenic epitopes of this protein was detected using indirect competitive ELISA. Molecular identification of the best proteolytic strain was fulfilled by 16S rDNA fragment sequencing with universal primers. The obtained results demonstrated that Enterococcus faecium isolated from raw camel milk samples was the most efficient isolate in hydrolyzing Na-caseinate and alpha(S1)-casein. Hydrolysated alpha(S1)-casein by Enterococcus faecium was also less recognized by IgE of bovine milk allergic patients' sera in comparison with native alpha(S1)-casein. It has been proposed that Enterococcus faecium could be an efficient strain in allergenicity reduction of cow's milk proteins. So it could be an excellent candidate to be potentially used in dairy industries.

AB Cell wall integrity signaling pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a conserved function for detecting and responding to cell stress conditions but less understood for industrial yeast. We examined gene expression dynamics for a tolerant industrial yeast strain NRRL Y-50049 in response to challenges of furfural and HMF through comparative quantitative gene expression analysis using pathway-based qRT-PCR array assays. All tested genes from Y-50049, except for MLP2, demonstrated more resistant and significantly increased gene expression than that from a laboratory strain BY4741. While all five sensor encoding genes WSC1, WSC2, WSC3, MID2 and MTL1 from both strains were activated in response to the furfural-HMF treatment, WSC3 from Y-50049 demonstrated the most increased expression over time compared with any other sensor genes. These results suggested the industrial yeast poses more robust cell wall integrity pathway, and gene WSC3 could have the special capability for signal transmission against furfural and HMF. Among five single nucleotide variations discovered in WSC3 from Y-50049, three were found to be non-synonymous mutations resulting in amino acid alterations of Ser(158) -> Tyr(158), Val(186) -> Ile(186), and Glu(430) -> Asp(430). Our results suggest the industrial yeast as a more desirable delivery vehicle for the next-generation biocatalyst development.

AB Biochemicals production is a major theme in the application of photosynthesis to address global warming and organic-resource problems. Among biochemicals, sugar alcohols have attracted research attention because they are directly derived from two photosynthetic products, sugars and reductants. Here, we produced sorbitol photosynthetically by using cyanobacteria and modified the supply of its substrates through genetic engineering. Expression of an NADPH-dependent enzyme that generates sorbitol-6-phosphate, S6PDH, was highly toxic to cyanobacteria likely due to the sorbitol production, whereas expression of an NADH-dependent enzyme, SrlD2, yielded no sorbitol. The toxicity was partly overcome by introducing a theophylline-inducible riboswitch for S6PDH expression and optimizing induction, but sorbitol production was still low and severely inhibited growth. Co-expression of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase drastically alleviated the growth inhibition, but did not increase short-term sorbitol production. The NADPH/NADP(+) ratio decreased during sorbitol production. Overexpression of a membrane-bound transhydrogenase for NADPH generation from NADH elevated the short-term sorbitol production, but only partly alleviated the growth inhibition. Notably, a strain overexpressing all three enzymes exhibited sustainable sorbitol production at 312 mg/L, which was nearly 27-fold higher than the yield of the initial S6PDH-overexpressing strain. We discuss these results in relation to the optimization of photosynthetic supply for sorbitol production in cyanobacteria.

AB An intensified process was developed that enables high level production of recombinant core streptavidin (cSAV), a non-glycosylated tetrameric protein utilised in a wide range of applications. A pH-stat fed-batch feeding strategy was employed to achieve high-cell-density and improve volumetric yield of cSAV which was expressed as inclusion bodies (IBs). The effect of induction at different cell densities (OD 20, 60 and 100) on volumetric and specific yield were then studied. Highest volumetric yield of cSAV (1550 mg L-1) was obtained from induction at OD 100 without significant reductions in specific yield. To recover active cSAV from IBs, the possibility of refolding using a temperature-based refolding method was investigated. Refolded cSAV obtained from temperature-based refolding were then compared against cSAV refolded with conventional dialysis and dilution methods using quantitative and qualitative metrics. The temperature-based refolding method was found to improve the yield of cSAV by 6-18% in comparison to conventional methods without compromising quality. Intensification was achieved by reductions in process volumes and a more concentrated product stream. Using the newly developed process, the volumetric yield of cSAV IBs was improved by thirty-six fold in comparison to low-cell-density shake flask cultivation, and 33% of cSAV can be recovered from IBs at 90% purity.

AB Alfalfa, usually known as the "Queen of Forages", is the main source of vegetable protein to meat and milk production systems worldwide. This legume is extremely rich in proteins due to its highly efficient symbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing strains. In the last years, alfalfa culture has been displaced to saline environments by other important crops, including major cereals, a fact that has reduced its biomass production and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. In this short communication, we report the high forage production and nutrient quality of alfalfa under saline conditions by alfalfa transformation with the AtNHX1 Na+/H+ antiporter and inoculation with the stress-resistant nitrogen-fixing strain Sinorhizobium meliloti B401. Therefore, the incorporation of transgenic traits into salt-sensitive legumes in association with the inoculation with natural stress-resistant isolates could be a robust approach to improve the productivity and quality of these important nitrogen-fixing crops.

AB Glycosylation on the Fc region of recombinant Immunoglobulin G (IgG) therapeutic antibodies is a critical protein quality attribute which may affect the efficacy and safety of the molecule. During the development of biosimilar therapeutics, adjustment of the glycosylation profile is required in order to match the reference innovator profile. Deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ), a known inhibitor of mannosidase, was used in this study to modulate the glycosylation pattern of antibodies. The effect of DMJ, at concentrations of 5 mu M - 500 mu M, on non-fucosylated glycoform levels was tested in the biosynthesis processes of two different IgG1 (IgG1 #A and IgG1 #B) using two Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines (CHO-DXB-11 and CHOK1SV, respectively) in Erlenmeyer flasks and in lab scale bioreactors. DMJ affected glycan forms in a dose response manner. At the highest concentration tested, DMJ reduced N-linked complex glycoform and core fucose levels by 15 and 14 fold, respectively, and increased high mannose level by 21 fold. 10 mu M DMJ decreased IgG1 #A core fucose level in CHO-DXB-11 from 92% to 73% and increased high mannose level from 4% to 22% in Erlenmeyer flasks. Furthermore, in lab scale bioreactors, 15 mu M DMJ decreased IgG1 #A core fucose level from 95% to 84% and increased high mannose level from 3% to 13%. Core fucose level of IgG1 #B in CHOK1SV was decreased from 81% to 73% using 10 mu M DMJ in lab scale bioreactors while high mannose was increased from 6% to 15%. While affecting core fucose and high mannose levels, DMJ decreased maximum viable cell concentration by 16% and did not significantly affect cell productivity (less than 10%). This study demonstrated that DMJ can enable the control of core fucosylated and high mannose levels of IgG1 antibodies in a defined range.

AB Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) primarily affects children younger than 5 years of age. Recently, HFMD has ranked as the top notifiable infectious disease in China. In December 2015, China approved two novel inactivated enterovirus 71 vaccines (EV71 vaccines) for HFMD. Parents' acceptance is often essential for vaccination program success. The goal of this study was to identify willingness and influential factors to vaccinate among parents of kindergarteners in Guangzhou, China. A cross-sectional survey of face-to-face interviews was conducted from March to July 2016. Fifty-five kindergartens were randomly selected from 11 districts of Guangzhou. An anonymous self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate awareness, knowledge and attitude towards HFMD and EV71 vaccines. A total of 868 parents participated in the survey. Mean( standard deviation) knowledge score of HFMD was 6.32( 1.70). Approximately 32.03% of parents had heard of the EV71 vaccines with 22.58% receiving information before this study. Nearly 44.24% of parents showed willingness to vaccinate their children. Previously receiving EV71 vaccine-related information [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-2.11], no fear of adverse effects (aOR = 4.25, 95%CI: 2.77-6.53), perceived susceptibility of children to HFMD (aOR = 2.15, 95%CI: 1.42-3.25) and children not previously diagnosed with HFMD (aOR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.07-2.27) were positively associated with EV71 vaccination acceptability. However, parental education background (aOR = 0.54, 95%Cl: 0.37-0.80) was negatively correlated with vaccination acceptability. Our study provides baseline information for future vaccination campaigns to help improve the EV71 vaccine uptake rate. Special efforts are urgently needed to improve the awareness and knowledge of EV71 vaccines in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Typhoid fever remains a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries where children aged 2-14 years bear the greatest burden. Vi polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in children <2 years of age, and protection in adults is modest. The limitations of Vi polysaccharide vaccines can be overcome by conjugation of the Vi to a carrier protein. A typhoid conjugate vaccine composed of Vi polysaccharide conjugated to diphtheria toxoid (Vi-DT) has been developed. The Phase I study results are presented here.
   Methods: This was a randomized, observer-blinded Phase I study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Vi-DT compared to Vi (R) polysaccharide vaccine, conducted in Manila, Philippines. Participants enrolled in an age de-escalation manner (18-45, 6-17 and 2-5 years) were randomized between Test (Vi-DT, 25 mu g) administered at 0 and 4 weeks and Comparator (Vi polysaccharide, Typhim Vi and Vaxigrip (R), Sanofi Pasteur) vaccines.
   Results: A total of 144 participants were enrolled (48 by age strata, 24 in Test and Comparator groups each). No serious adverse event was reported in either group. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were mild or moderate in both groups with the exception of a 4-year old girl in Test group with grade 3 fever which resolved without sequelae. All participants in Test group seroconverted after first and second doses of Vi-DT while the proportions in the Comparator group were 97.1% and 97.2%, after first dose of Typhim Vi (R) and second dose of Vaxigrip (R), respectively. Vi-DT showed 4-fold higher Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) compared to Typhim Vi (R) (adjusted for age strata, p < 0.001). No further increase of GMT was detected after the second dose of Vi-DT. Anti-DT lgG seroresponse rates were 81.2% and 84.5% post first and second Vi-DT doses, respectively.
   Conclusions: Vi-DT vaccine was safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic in participants aged 2-45 years. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to gather a global picture of vaccine hesitancy and whether/how it is changing, an analysis was undertaken to review three years of data available as of June 2017 from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Report Form (JRF) to determine the reported rate of vaccine hesitancy across the globe, the cited reasons for hesitancy, if these varied by country income level and/or by WHO region and whether these reasons were based upon an assessment. The reported reasons were classified using the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization matrix of hesitancy determinants (www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/october/SAGE_working_group_revised_report_vaccine_hesitancy.pdf). Hesitancy was common, reported by >90% of countries. The list of cited reasons was long and covered 22 of 23 WHO determinants matrix categories. Even the most frequently cited category, risk-benefit (scientific evidence e.g. vaccine safety concerns), accounted for less than one quarter of all reasons cited. The reasons varied by country income level, by WHO region and over time and within a country. Thus based upon this JRF data, across the globe countries appear to understand the SAGE vaccine hesitancy definition and use it to report reasons for hesitancy. However, the rigour of the cited reasons could be improved as only just over 1/3 of countries reported that their reasons were assessment based, the rest were opinion based. With respect to any assessment in the previous five years, upper middle income countries were the least likely to have done an assessment. These analyses provided some of the evidence for the 2017 Assessment Report of the Global Vaccine Action Plan recommendation that each country develop a strategy to increase acceptance and demand for vaccination, which should include ongoing community engagement and trust-building, active hesitancy prevention, regular national assessment of vaccine concerns, and crisis response planning (www.who.int/immunizationisage/meetings/2017/october/1_GVAP_Assessment_report_web_version.pdf).

AB Introduction: The 2013 reemergence of wild poliovirus in Israel led to the reinstatement of a routine OPV vaccination. Fearing VAPP in immunocompromised, the MOH regulated contraindications for vaccination candidates and household contacts. In this study we estimate the size of the contraindicated population to OPV vaccination.
   Method: We studied vaccination candidates aged 2-9 and 14-23 months and probable household contacts. Using the rate of contraindications extracted for each study group from a medical records database, a statistical model was built to estimate the probability of contraindications in candidates.
   Results: 3.9% of the 2-9-month-old study group and 4% of the 14-23-month-old group had contraindications by either self or household contacts.
   Conclusion: A statistical model can provide an estimation of the contraindicated population and can be used in the future when devising vaccination campaigns. In contrast to concerns raised by the MOH, our findings show a smaller than anticipated contraindicated population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mumps, a common childhood disease in the pre-vaccine era that causes swelling of the parotid salivary glands, can lead to orchitis, viral meningitis, and sensorineural deafness. While the incidence of disease decreased dramatically after the vaccine was added to standard vaccination schedules, the disease has made a substantial resurgence in recent years. As a result, it becomes critical to examine the factors involved in recurring outbreaks. Although low and incomplete vaccination coverage may be a key reason, it does not fully explain the issue due to the high rate of occurrence in populations with high vaccination coverage rates. Multiple studies suggest that waning immunity and secondary vaccine failure play a large role, the effects of which were previously masked by subclinical boosting. Significant knowledge gaps persist around the exact role and mechanism of waning immunity and demonstrate the need for more research in this area, as well as a reevaluation of mumps vaccine policy.

AB Background: Vaccination with conjugated meningococcal vaccines is the best way to prevent invasive meningococcal disease. Changes in serogroup epidemiology have led to the inclusion of quadrivalent vaccines in the national immunization programs of several countries, but vaccines are frequently in short supply. Intradermal administration has the potential to increase vaccine availability through dose reduction, without sacrificing efficacy. It has never before been investigated for glycoconjugate meningococcal vaccines.
   Methods: Different fractional doses of two quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MenACWY-CRM197 (Menveo) and MenACWY-TT (Nimenrix (R))) were administered intradermally to sequential groups of 4 participants, according to an adaptive dose escalation design, starting at 1/10th of the original dose. Booster doses were given after 4-6 months based on interim serology results using a multiplex bead-based assay (MIA). Final analyses were based on serum bactericidal antibody titers (rSBA).
   Results: A total of 12 subjects were enrolled (average 25 years old, range 19-48). MenACWY-CRM197 became unavailable during the course of the study and was only evaluated for a 1/10th dose. This dose resulted in less than complete seroprotection for serogroup A but complete protection against the other serogroups. MenACWY-TT was evaluated for a 1/10th and 1/5th dose level. Both fractional doses of MenACWY-TT resulted in complete seroprotection against all vaccine serogroups. Geometric mean titers 1 month after vaccination were lower and decayed faster in the MenACWY-CRM197 group. Adverse events were mild and there were no serious adverse events.
   Conclusion: Fractional intradermal vaccination against meningococcal disease with quadrivalent conjugate vaccine appears to be safe and effective in our small dose finding study. Tetanus toxoid conjugated vaccine (Nimenrix (R)) shows a trend towards higher antibody levels compared to CRM197-conjugated vaccine (Menveo). The 1/5th fractional dose of MenACWY-TT appears to result in higher antibody levels than does the 1/10th dose. These results can be used for a larger non-inferiority study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: It is important to examine the risk of Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) after vaccination.
   Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study between January 2011 and December 2015. Four controls per case were matched for age, gender, address. An independent expert committee validated the diagnoses of cases and controls. Data on vaccinations were obtained from computerized vaccination records. The analyses were conducted with the use of conditional logistic regression.
   Results: The analyses include 272 cases of ADEM and 1096 controls. No increase in the risk of ADEM was observed for vaccination against hepatitis B, influenza, polio(live), diphtheria, pertuss(acellular), tetanusis, measles, mumps, rubella, Japanese Encephalitis, meningitis, hepatitis A, varicella and rabies vaccines. Vaccine was associated with a statistically significant increase in risk in the 31-60-day exposure interval (OR, 4.04 [95% CI, 1.07-12.69]), but not the 0-30 and 61-180-day interval. There was no association between vaccine received and the recurrence of ADEM.
   Conclusions: Findings from the present study do not demonstrate an association of vaccines with an increased risk of ADEM and its recurrence among either paediatric (<18 years) or adult (>18 years) individuals within the 180 days after vaccinations. The finding in children in the 31-60 day risk interval is likely coincidental and was not confirmed in separate self-control analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Therapeutic vaccines represent a unique approach to hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment and have the potential to induce long-term control of infection. This study explored the immune responses of rhesus macaques to novel vaccines comprising the S, PreS1, and Core antigens of the HBV that showed promise as prophylactic and therapeutic approaches in a mouse model. The tested vaccines included two DNA vaccines (pVRC-SS1, pVRC-CS1), an HBV particle subunit (HBSS1) vaccine and the recombinant vaccinia virus-(RVJ-) based vaccines (RVJSS1 and RVJCS1) in which SSI containing S (1-223 aa) and PreS1 (21-47 aa), CS1 containing Core (1-144 aa) and PreS1 (1-42 aa). The humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) induced by vaccines comprising the S, PreS1, and Core antigens of HBV were investigated in a longitudinal study that continued up to 98 weeks after the first vaccination. In rhesus macaques, anti-PreS1 antibody was induced more rapidly than anti-S or anti-Core antibody after DNA vaccination. The antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against S, PreSi, and C were significantly enhanced in macaques boosted with RVJCSI and RVJCS1, whereas the cell-mediated response to C was most robust and durable. The immune response to 5, PreS1, and C was restored by HBSS1 boosting and detected in macaques until weeks 74 and 98 after the first vaccination. Additionally, robust neutralizing activity was detected at week 52. In conclusion, novel HBV vaccine candidates, especially those used for therapeutic applications should incorporate the PreS1 and Core antigens. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Abnormal temperatures are a major issue for vaccines within the Expanded Program of Immunization in tropical climates. Prolonged exposure to temperatures outside the standard +2 degrees C/+8 degrees C range can impact vaccine potency.
   Methods: The current study used automatic temperature recording devices (Testostore 171-1 (c)) to monitor cold chain in remote areas of Western Burkina Faso. A series of 25 randomly selected health centers representing 33% of the existing 176 EPI facilities in Western Burkina Faso were prospectively assessed for eight months in 2015. Automatic measurements were compared to routine temperature loggers and vaccine vial monitors (VVM).
   Results: The median age for all refrigerators was 9 years with 10/25 (42%) older than 10 years. Adverse temperatures were recorded in 20/24 (83%) refrigerators and ranged from -18.5 degrees C to +34.2 degrees C with 12,958/128,905 (10%) abnormal hourly records below +2 degrees C and 7357/128,905 (5.7%) above +8 degrees C. Time of day significantly affected the rate of temperature excursions, with higher rates from 00 am to 06 am (p < 0.001) for low temperatures and 10-12 am (p < 0.001) and 13-16 pm (p < 0.001) for high temperatures. Abnormal temperatures lasted from 1 h to 24 h below +2 degrees C and 13-24 h above +8 degrees C. Standard manual registers reported only 182/2761 (7%) inadequate temperatures and VVM color change detected only 133/2465 (5%) disruptions. Reliability of the refrigerators ranged from 48% to 98.7% with a median of 70%. Risk factors for excursions were old age of the refrigerators, the months of April and May, hours of high activity during the day, and health staff-associated factors such as inappropriate actions or insufficient knowledge.
   Conclusion: Important cold chain reliability issues reported in the current study in Western Burkina Faso raise concern about vaccine potency. In the absence of systematic renewal of the cold chain infrastructure or improved staff training and monitoring, antibody response assessment is recommended to study levels of effective immunization coverage.

AB Group A Streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus pyogenes is responsible for an estimated 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. Protection against GAS infection is thought to be mediated by phagocytosis, enhanced by bacteria-specific antibody. There are no licenced GAS vaccines, despite many promising candidates in preclinical and early stage clinical development, the most advanced of which are based on the GAS M-protein. Vaccine progress has been hindered, in part, by the lack of a standardised functional assay suitable for vaccine evaluation. Current assays, developed over 50 years ago, rely on non-immune human whole blood as a source of neutrophils and complement. Variations in complement and neutrophil activity between donors result in variable data that is difficult to interpret. We have developed an opsonophagocytic killing assay (OPKA) for GAS that utilises dimethylformamide (DMF)-differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) as a source of neutrophils and baby rabbit complement, thus removing the major sources of variation in current assays. We have standardised the OPKA for several clinically relevant GAS strain types (emm1, emm6 and emm12) and have shown antibody-specific killing for each emm-type using M-protein specific rabbit antisera. Specificity was demonstrated by pre incubation of the antisera with homologous M-protein antigens that blocked antibody-specific killing. Additional qualifications of the GAS OPKA, including the assessment of the accuracy, precision, linearity and the lower limit of quantification, were also performed. This GAS OPKA assay has the potential to provide a robust and reproducible platform to accelerate GAS vaccine development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oligoclonal combinations of several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are being considered for the treatment of various infectious pathologies. These combinations are less sensitive to antigen structural changes than individual MAbs; at the same time, their characteristics can be more efficiently controlled than those of polyclonal antibodies. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the binding characteristics of six biclonal equimolar preparations (BEP) of tetanus toxin (TeNT)-specific MAbs and to investigate how the MAb combination influences the BEPs' protective capacity. We show that a combination of TeNT-specific MAbs, which not only bind TeNT but also exert positive cooperative effects, results in a BEP with superior binding characteristics and protective capacity, when compared with the individual component MAbs. Furthermore, we show that a MAb with only partial protective capacity but positive effects on the binding of the other BEP component can be used as a valuable constituent of the BEP.

AB Background: Injection using needle and syringe (N&S) is the most widely used method for vaccination, but requires trained healthcare workers. Fear of needles, risk of needle-stick injury, and the need to reconstitute lyophilised vaccines, are also drawbacks. The Nanopatch (NP) is a microarray skin patch comprised of a high-density array of microprojections dry-coated with vaccine that is being developed to address these shortcomings. Here we report a randomised, partly-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that represents the first use in humans of the NP to deliver a vaccine.
   Methods: Healthy volunteers were vaccinated once with one of the following: (1) NPs coated with split inactivated influenza virus (A/California/07/2009 [H1N1], 15 mu g haemagglutinin (HA) per dose), applied to the volar forearm (NP-HAIFA), n = 15; (2) NPs coated with split inactivated influenza virus (A/California/07/2009 11-11N1 I, 15 mu g HA per dose), applied to the upper arm (NP-HA/UA), n = 15; (3) Fluvaxe (R) 2016 containing 15 mu g of the same H1N1 HA antigen injected intramuscularly (IM) into the deltoid (IM-HA/D), n = 15; (4) NPs coated with excipients only, applied to the volar forearm (NP-placebo/FA), n = 5; (5) NPs coated with excipients only applied to the upper arm (NP-placebo/UA), n = 5; or (6) Saline injected IM into the deltoid (IM-placebo/D), n = 5. Antibody responses at days 0, 7, and 21 were measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralisation (MN) assays.
   Findings: NP vaccination was safe and acceptable; all adverse events were mild or moderate. Most subjects (55%) receiving patch vaccinations (HA or placebo) preferred the NP compared with their past experience of IM injection with N&S (preferred by 24%). The antigen-vaccinated groups had statistically higher HAI titres at day 7 and 21 compared with baseline (p < 0.0001), with no statistical differences between the treatment groups (p > 0.05), although the group sizes were small. The geometric mean HAI titres at day 21 for the NP-HA/FA, NP-HA/UA and IM-HA/D groups were: 335 (189-593 95% CI), 160 (74-345 95% CI), and 221 (129-380 95% CI) respectively. A similar pattern of responses was seen with the MN assays. Application site reactions were mild or moderate, and more marked with the influenza vaccine NPs than with the placebo or IM injection.
   Interpretation: Influenza vaccination using the NP appeared to be safe, and acceptable in this first time in humans study, and induced similar immune responses to vaccination by IM injection. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent measles and pertussis outbreaks in the US have focused national attention on state laws governing exemptions from mandatory vaccines for school entry. After several years of increases in nonmedical exemptions in California, the state assembly passed Assembly Bill 2109 in 2012, making nonmedical exemptions more difficult to obtain by requiring parents to obtain a signature from a health care provider. We used data from the California Department of Public Health to describe changes in the overall prevalence of personal belief exemptions and compositional changes in immunization status for the school years 2012-2013 through 2015-2016. Following the implementation of Assembly Bill 2109, the statewide exemption rate declined from 3.1% in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014 and then to 2.3% in 2015, representing a 25% reduction from the 2013 peak. Continued surveillance of exemption rates and vaccine refusal are needed to monitor and protect herd immunity against vaccine-preventable diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease serotype O viruses (FMDV/O) are responsible for the most outbreaks in FMD endemic countries. O1/BFS is one of the recommended FMD/O vaccine strains by World Reference Laboratory for FMD. In the current study, FMDV/O1 BFS vaccine strain and serotype O field isolates (45) were analyzed phylogenetically and antigenically to gain more insight into the genetic and antigenic characteristics of the vaccine strain and field isolates.
   O1/BFS showed similarity with 89% of the field isolates using a virus neutralization test (VNT). The P1 region encoding the FMDV capsid was sequenced and analysed for 46 strains of FMDV/O. Phylogenetic analysis showed these viruses originated from five continents and covered eight of 11 reported topotypes. Five isolates that demonstrated low antigenic similarities with O1/BFS were analyzed for their antigenic variation at the known neutralizing antigenic sites. Three of the five isolates demonstrated unique amino acid substitutions at various antigenic sites. No unique amino acid substitutions were observed for the other two unmatched isolates. Positively selected residues were identified on the surface of the FMD virus capsid supporting that it is important to continuously monitor field isolates for their antigenic and phenotypic changes.
   In conclusion, the vaccine strain O1/BFS is likely to confer protection against 89% of the 45 FMDV/O isolates based on VNT. Thus O1/US vaccine strain is still suitable for use in global FMD serotype O outbreak control. Combining data from phylogenetic, molecular and antigenic analysis can provide improvements in the process of vaccine selection. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia. Although this is a vaccine preventable disease, S. pneumoniae still causes over 1 million deaths per year, mainly in children under the age of five. The biggest disease burden is in the developing world, which is mainly due to unavailability of vaccines due to their high costs. Protein polysaccharide conjugate vaccines are given routinely in the developed world to children to induce a protective antibody response against S. pneumoniae. One of these vaccines is Prevnar13, which targets 13 of the 95 known capsular types. Current vaccine production requires growth of large amounts of the 13 serotypes, and isolation of the capsular polysaccharide that is then chemically coupled to a protein, such as the diphtheria toxoid CRM197, in a multistep expensive procedure. In this study, we design, purify and produce novel recombinant pneumococcal protein polysaccharide conjugate vaccines in Escherichia coli, which act as mini factories for the low-cost production of conjugate vaccines. Recombinant vaccine efficacy was tested in a murine model of pneumococcal pneumonia; ability to protect against invasive disease was compared to that of Prevnar13. This study provides the first proof of principle that protein polysaccharide conjugate vaccines produced in E. coli can be used to prevent pneumococcal infection. Vaccines produced in this manner may provide a low-cost alternative to the current vaccine production methodology. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To monitor the changes in prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in women <50 years of age, participating in cervical screening programs of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, before and after introduction of quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccination.
   Methods: Liquid-based cytology samples were collected from 6538 women who attended cervical screening in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in 2006-2008 and from 6332 similarly enrolled women in 2012-2013. Denmark started organized qHPV vaccination in 2008, Norway in 2009, and Sweden in 2012. All HPV testing and genotyping was performed using identical enrollment and analysis methods, by accredited general primer polymerase chain reaction methods with typing using the Luminex system.
   Results: Overall HPV positivity declined slightly from 36.5% in 2006-2008 to 34.5% in 2012-2013. The decline was most pronounced among women 18-26 years of age: from 54.4% to 48.1% (P < 0.001). The decline was substantial for vaccine HPV types (HPV6/11/16/18: decline from 22.3% to 16.6%; P < 0.001) and was seen for both low-risk vaccine types (HPV6/1 I declined from 5.0% to 2.5%) and high-risk vaccine types (HPV16/18 declined from 18.9% to 14.9%). Among women 27-50 years of age, there was no change between the time periods (22.5% and 21.6%, respectively). The significant decline in the younger age group was different in the 3 countries.
   Conclusion: This population-based study enrolling >12,000 women participating in cervical screening in the 3 Nordic countries before and after introduction of organized qHPV vaccination demonstrated a marked decline in HPV infection in the younger population in the 2 countries where qHPV vaccination programs started in 2008-2009, suggesting that organized HPV vaccination programs resulted in a decrease of HPV types circulating in the general population.

AB Background: Vaccination rates against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the US remain alarmingly low. Physicians can significantly influence a parent's decision to vaccinate their children. However, medical education often lacks training on specific strategies for communicating with vaccine hesitant parents.
   Methods: We created an innovative curriculum designed to teach medical students how to address HPV vaccine hesitancy. The curriculum consisted of (1) a presentation on the epidemiology, biology, and disease morbidity associated with HPV, (2) a video that teaches specific communication strategies and (3) role-playing simulations. This curriculum was delivered to medical students at two separate sites. Medical students were surveyed before and after completing the educational curriculum. The surveys assessed student comfort talking to HPV vaccine hesitant parents and their likelihood to recommend the HPV vaccine.
   Results: Pre- and post-intervention surveys were completed by 101 of the 132 participants (77% response rate). After the intervention, student awareness of the benefits of the HPV vaccine increased by a mean of 0.82 points (Likert scale 1-5, p < 0.01) and student comfort talking to vaccine hesitant parents increased by a mean of 1.37 points (p < 0.01). Prior to the intervention, students more strongly recommended the HPV vaccine to females compared to males, but this gender disparity was eliminated after the intervention (p < 0.01). Personal vaccination status was independately associated with a higher likelihood of recommending the HPV vaccine both before and after the intervention.
   Conclusion: Our innovative curriculum improved medical student comfort level discussing HPV vaccination with hesitant parents and increased the perceived likelihood of recommending HPV vaccination. The intervention is easy to implement, scalable, and requires minimal resources. Educating future providers on this important topic has the potential to improve vaccination rates nationwide and thus should be considered for all medical students. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The costs of delivering routine immunization services in India vary widely across facilities, districts and states. Understanding the factors influencing this cost variation could help predict future immunization costs and suggest approaches for improving the efficiency of service provision.
   We examined determinants of facility cost for immunization services based on a nationally representative sample of sub-centres and primary health centres (99 and 89 facilities, respectively) by regressing logged total facility costs, both including and excluding vaccine cost, against several explanatory variables. We used a multi-level regression model to account for the multi-stage sampling design, including state- and district-level random effects.
   We found that facility costs were significantly associated with total doses administered, type of facility, salary of the main vaccinator, number of immunization sessions, and the distance of the facility from the nearest cold chain point.
   Use of pentavalent vaccine by the state was an important determinant of total facility cost including vaccine cost. India is introducing several new vaccines including some supported by Gavi. Therefore, the government will have to ensure that additional resources will be made available after the support from Gavi ceases. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower airway disease in infants worldwide and repeatedly infects immunocompetent individuals throughout life. Severe lower airway RSV infection during infancy can be life-threatening, but is also associated with important sequelae including development of asthma and recurrent wheezing in later childhood. The basis for the inadequate, short-lived adaptive immune response to RSV infection is poorly understood, but it is widely recognized that RSV actively antagonizes Type I interferon (IFN) production. In addition to the induction of the anti-viral state, IFN production during viral infection is critical for downstream development of robust, long-lived immunity. Based on the hypothesis that a vaccine that induced robust IFN production would be protective, we previously constructed a Newcastle disease virus-vectored vaccine that expresses the F glycoprotein of RSV (NDV-F) and demonstrated that vaccinated mice had reduced lung viral loads and an enhanced IFN-gamma response after RSV challenge. Here we show that vaccination also protected cotton rats from RSV challenge and induced long-lived neutralizing antibody production, even in RSV immune animals. Finally, pulmonary eosinophilia induced by RSV infection of unvaccinated cotton rats was prevented by vaccination. Overall, these data demonstrate enhanced protective immunity to RSV F when this protein is presented in the context of an abortive NDV infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an important viral cause of reproductive disease, immune suppression and clinical disease in cattle. The objective of this study was to compare reproductive protection in cattle against the impacts of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) provided by three different multivalent vaccines containing inactivated BVDV. BVDV negative beef heifers and cows (n = 122) were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Groups A-C (n = 34/group) received two pre-breeding doses of one of three commercially available multivalent vaccines containing inactivated fractions of BVDV 1 and BVDV 2, and Group D (n = 20) served as negative control and received two doses of saline prior to breeding. Animals were bred, and following pregnancy diagnosis, 110 cattle [Group A (n = 31); Group B (n = 32); Group C (n = 31); Group D (n = 16)1 were subjected to a 28-day exposure to cattle persistently infected (PI) with BVDV (1a, 1b and 2a). Of the 110 pregnancies, 6 pregnancies resulted in fetal resorption with no material for testing. From the resultant 104 pregnancies, BVDV transplacental infections were demonstrated in 73 pregnancies. The BVDV fetal infection rate (FI) was calculated at 13/30 (43%) for Group A cows, 27/29 (93%) for Group B cows, 18/30 (60%) for Group C cows, and 15/15 (100%) for Group D cows. Statistical differences were observed between groups with respect to post-vaccination antibody titers, presence and duration of viremia in pregnant cattle, and fetal infection rates in offspring from BVDV-exposed cows. Group A vaccination resulted in significant protection against BVDV infection as compared to all other groups based upon outcome measurements, while Group B vaccination did not differ in protection against BVDV infection from control Group D. Ability of inactivated BVDV vaccines to provide protection against BVDV fetal infection varies significantly among commercially available products; however, in this challenge model, the inactivated vaccines provided unacceptable levels of BVDV FI protection.

AB Background: Young sexual minority individuals have lower human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine completion rates than the general population, and little is known about how gender minority people perceive HPV vaccination. The aim of this study was to qualitatively identify patient-, provider-, and systems-level barriers and facilitators for HPV vaccination among sexual and gender minority (SGM) people.
   Methods: Fifteen SGM-identified individuals, ages 23-26, were recruited at an urban community health center in Boston, MA, that specializes in care for SGM. Participants were enrolled in a study that utilized surveys and in-person focus groups. During focus groups, participants were asked to describe their perceived barriers and facilitators for completion of HPV vaccination.
   Results: Fourteen participants reported having a sexual minority identity, and five participants reported having a gender minority identity. Participants described the following factors influencing HPV vaccination: (1) at the patient level, low HPV-related knowledge and lack of engagement in care were associated with less vaccination, whereas fear of HPV-related disease motivated vaccination; (2) at the provider level, knowledge and SGM cultural-competence related to HPV was associated with patient willingness to be vaccinated; (3) at the systems level, SGM identity-affirming healthcare settings were associated with increased vaccination, whereas historical trends in HPV vaccine marketing selectively for cisgender women and lack of public awareness of HPV-related disease among SGM were associated with decreased vaccincation.
   Conclusion: Our study identified internal and external barriers for HPV vaccination related among SGM patients. These findings highlight the need to increase public awareness about the risks of HPV-related disease among SGM and educate SGM youth about HPV-related disease and vaccine importance. Finally, this study supports the need for future interventions to cultivate SGM-competent providers and SGM identity-affirming healthcare settings as a way to increase HPV vaccination.

AB The epidemiology of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is constantly changing as new strains are introduced into a population and older strains are removed through vaccination, population immunity or natural trends. Consequently, the clinical disease associated with circulating strains may also change over time. In England, IMD incidence has declined from 1.8/100,000 in 2010/2011 to 1.1/100,000 in 2013/2014, with a small increase in 2014/2015 to 1.3/100,000. Between 01 January 2011 and 30 June 2015, MenB was responsible for 73.0% (n = 2489) of 3411 laboratory-confirmed IMD cases, followed by MenW (n = 371, 10.9%), MenY (n = 373, 10.9%) and MenC (n = 129, 3.8%); other capsular groups were rare (n = 49, 1.4%). Detailed questionnaires were completed for all 3411 laboratory-confirmed cases. Clinical presentation varied by capsular group and age. Atypical presentations were uncommon (244/3411; 7.2%), increasing from 1.2% (41/3411) in children to 3.5% (120/3411) in older adults. Known IMD risk factors were rare (18/3411; 0.5%) and included complement deficiency (n = 11), asplenia (n = 6) or both (n = 1). Nearly a third of cases required intensive care (1069/3411; 31.3%), with rates highest in adults. The 28-day CFR was 6.9% (n = 237), with the lowest rates in 0-14 year-olds (85/1885, 4.5%) and highest among 85+ year-olds (30/94, 31.9%). These observations provide a useful baseline for the current burden of IMD in a European country with enhanced national surveillance. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This research focuses on the potential of the dual-fuel combustion engine fueled with regular gasoline and diesel to meet the Euro V emission standard over the whole operating range with a simple after-treatment system. For this purpose, a mode-switching strategy was investigated in this work. The engine maps of this strategy were obtained using a dedicated experimental procedure on a modified heavy-duty multi-cylinder engine. The switching of dual-fuel modes mainly depended on the engine load. At 25% engine load, fully premixed reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion was applied to achieve high efficiency and low emission combustion. At operating conditions higher than 50% load, homogeneous charge induced ignition combustion with up to three diesel injections (pre-, main and post-injections) was applied. Then, the effects of compression ratio on the dual-fuel combustion over the full operating map were explored and analyzed in detail. It was found that in spite of a slight increase in the fuel consumption, better combustion and emission performance over the whole operating map could be achieved in the dual-fuel combustion with a lower compression ratio. Finally, the effects of diesel oxidation catalyst were also investigated. The exhaust temperatures of this dual-fuel strategy were higher than the diesel oxidation catalyst light-off temperature, ensuring an effective conversion of the total hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Furthermore, from the particle number-size distribution analysis, it was found that reactivity controlled compression ignition was dominated by the nucleation mode particles, while homogeneous charge induced ignition was dominated by the accumulation mode particles which tended to increase as the load increased. In addition, with a lower compression ratio of 16:1 and the application of diesel oxidation catalyst, the cycle-averaged regular emissions of the mode-switching combustion strategy could meet the Euro V emission standard simultaneously in the European Stationary Cycle test.

AB A novel power/cooling cogeneration system based on an ammonia-water power cycle is proposed and investigated. The cooling capacity of the conventional combined system is much improved since an absorption-ejector refrigeration cycle is introduced. Besides the novel combined system could get more high-grade work at the same time obtain amounts of refrigeration due to the unique coupling mode. A mathematical model of the novel system is developed for system simulations under steady-state conditions. The results show that the thermal efficiency and the energy efficiency are 21.34% and 38.95%, respectively. Energy analysis shows that the energy destruction mainly occurs in the recovery heat exchanger, followed by boiler and rectifier, respectively. Parametric study shows that the absorber temperature, the cycle high pressure, the temperature at boiler outlet and the extracting ratio have significant effects on the system performance. In addition, a multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II method is carried out to obtain the final optimums of the proposed system. The optimization results show that the energy efficiency and the overall capital cost rate are 37.24% and 0.69408 $/ h, respectively, and the thermal efficiency versus the overall capital cost rate are found to be 20.99% and 0.73351 $/h.

AB High precision and reliable wind speed forecasting is important for the management of the wind power. This paper develops a novel wind speed prediction model based on the WPD (Wavelet Packet Decomposition), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and CNNLSTM (Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Network). In the proposed WPD-CNNLSTM-CNN model, the WPD is employed to decompose the original wind speed time series into a number of sub-layers; the CNN with 1D convolution operator is used to forecast the obtained high-frequency sublayers; and the CNNLSTM is adopted to complete the forecasting of the low-frequency sub-layer. To verify and compare the prediction performance of the proposed model, eight models are used. According to the results of four experimental tests, it can be observed that: (1) the proposed model is robust and effective in predicting the 1D wind speed time series, besides, among the involved eight models, the proposed model can perform best in wind speed 1-step to 3-step predictions; (2) when the wind speed experiences sudden change, the proposed model can have better prediction performance than the other involved models.

AB A coupled system of dark fermentation and microalgal cultivation was applied to investigate the hydrogen and lipid production potentials from three main substrates of food waste. Compared with waste proteins and waste fats, waste carbohydrates were more appropriate for energy production, which exhibited the highest cumulative hydrogen volume of 668.3 +/- 36.5 mL L-1 and hydrogen yield of 133.66 +/- 7.31 mL g(-1) substrate. Most byproducts of dark fermentation were consumed in algal culture process, and the maximum lipid content and lipid productivity reached 33.2 +/- 1.8% and 52.6 +/- 1.1 mg L-1 d(-1), respectively. The energy conversion efficiency significantly enhanced from 10.14% (dark fermentation) to 24.06% (coupled system). In continuous operation, energy production was steady and efficient, and the average hydrogen production rate of 741.4 mL L-1 d(-1) and average lipid concentration of 0.4 g L-1 were obtained. This study provides a promising and sustainable route for efficient energy recovery from waste substrates by using coupled hydrogen and lipid production system in long-term operation.

AB It is crucial to enhance the entrainment performance of steam ejectors which operate under double-critical conditions to widen their application in industries. In this paper, combined auxiliary entrainment technical approach is proposed and corresponding geometric structure optimization has implemented systematically, for a better use of the inside low-pressure potential thus greatly improving the entrainment performance of the steam ejector under double-critical conditions. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis and discussion of the influence of the geometrical parameters on the auxiliary entrainment performance has been obtained from mass flow rate, pressure field and special internal flow characteristics. The results reveal that the combined auxiliary entrainment is the best choice for the given steam ejector operating under the double-critical conditions, and the optimum geometrical parameters of throat auxiliary entraining entrance are same as the designed condition and remain unchanged. For the diffuser auxiliary entraining entrance, the opening starting position X-s could be set at the entrance of the diffuser identically, the opening angle could be chosen as a common range R e from 75 degrees to 105 degrees. However, the optimum opening width d increases with the decrease of back pressure p(c). In general, there is an optimum geometrical parameters combination that the entrainment performance can achieve its maximum value for each p(c). The smaller the p(c), the bigger the entrainment ratio improvement, as large as 34.8% for p(c) of 32 kPa.

AB Thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analysis are performed for a novel combined supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) recompression cycle and regenerative organic Rankine cycle (ORC) using zeotropic mixture. Comprehensive parametric studies are carried out to investigate the effect of significant system parameters as pressure ratio, split ratio, evaporation temperature, pinch point temperature difference in the evaporator and the mass fraction of zeotropic mixture on the exergy efficiency and total product unit cost. Employing the multi-objective optimization method based on genetic algorithm and the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation) decision making, the Pareto front solutions and optimum system parameters are obtained. In particular, several zeotropic mixtures are parameterized and used as a decision variable to participate in the multi-objective optimization process to obtain the optimal zeotropic mixture. The result shows that the optimal zeotropic mixture is R236fa/R227ea (0.46/0.54). The optimum values of exergy efficiency and total product unit cost are found to be 73.65% and 10.93 $/GJ, respectively. Furthermore, comparison analysis reveals the superiority of the proposed combined cycle to the single S-CO2 cycle and the combined S-CO2 cycle and basic ORC.

AB The effects of the first step pyrolysis temperature (T1) and residence time (RT1) on the two-step pyrolysis (TSP) were investigated by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with FTIR spectrophotometer (TG-FTIR) was used to analyze the pyrolysis characteristics of corncob. T1 was classified into low temperature (T1-L: 250 degrees C, 300 degrees C and 350 degrees C), medium temperature (T1-M: 400 degrees C and 450 degrees C) and high temperature (T1-H: 500 degrees C and 550 degrees C). Compared with one-step pyrolysis (OSP), T1 -M was the optimal condition in TSP to increase the selectivities of value-added chemicals such as acetic acid, furfural, 4-vinylphenol, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and guaiacol, etc. Few acids and more hydrocarbons with content of 10.54% were acquired in the second step at T1-M, which was conducive to improving the quality of bio-oil. Different RT1 at T1-M could further increase the selectivities of specific products such as furfural at T1 of 450 degrees C with 10 s, toluene at T1 of 450 degrees C with 20 s, and acetic acid, 4-vinylphenol, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and vanillin at T1 of 450 degrees C with 5 s, etc. Based on the results, a new polygeneration approach of TSP for efficient utilization of biomass was proposed.

The Ni-Cu/MgO center dot Al2O3 catalyst possessing mesoporous structure and large BET surface area (126.28 m(2)g(-1)) was successfully synthesized by facile simultaneous sol-gel method (SSGM) in the absence of surfactants. The results showed that the addition of Pd significantly improved the catalytic activity and stability. The effect of different nominal loadings of palladium (2, 4 and 6 wt%) on the catalytic performance was also studied. Among the prepared samples, the promoted sample with 4 wt% of palladium showed optimal catalytic performance and stability at higher temperatures towards methane thermocatalytic decomposition.

AB One key strategy for maximizing the performance of fuel cells is the choice of proper flow field pattern. In this paper, a procedure was developed for the proper design of parallel serpentine flow field for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Several parameters including the channel width and height, the rib between two adjacent channels, and the numbers of parallel channels and serpentine turns were considered and all the possible flow field configurations within the range of these design parameters were defined. In the next step, six consecutive constraining filters were defined and enforced to all the possible flow field configurations. In the final step, a complete three dimensional simulations were conducted for the remaining cases. Based on the results of the simulations, these cases were ranked, with the best case corresponds to the flow field with the minimum pressure drop, the maximum oxygen content at the surface of catalyst layer, maximum uniformity of oxygen distribution within the catalyst layer and minimum content of the condensate produced within the catalyst layer.

AB Geometry optimization of thermoelectric leg plays an essential role in improving the performance of thermoelectric generator (TEG). In the present study, theoretical analysis of an annular thermoelectric generator (ATEG) is carried out and a general model for investigating the influence of geometry configuration of thermoelectric leg and contact resistance on the output power, output power per unit mass and conversion efficiency is established. The results show that maximum output power per unit mass can be attained only when the cross-section area of thermoelectric leg is constant for the ideal ATEG. The optimized shape parameter is affected by the length of thermoelectric leg if the effect of contact resistance is taken into consideration, however, the calculation error of the performance induced by the variation of shape parameter is very small. In addition, the decrease in maximum conversion efficiency also varies slightly with the optimized shape parameter corresponding to the maximum output power. This study will be very helpful in designing actual ATEG devices.

AB For the safe and efficient operation of concentrator photovoltaic cells and electronic chips, low and uniform temperature should be attained. Therefore, the prime focus of this study is to design the optimal headers and to evaluate the performance of a monolithic double-layer microchannel heat sink (MDL-MCHS) operating under forced convective boiling conditions. The designed and fabricated heat sink was proved to attain a uniform temperature distribution over the entire surface of the MCHS heated wall, in a narrow temperature range around the coolant boiling point. The designs of the MCHS inlet and outlet headers were computationally optimized to avoid flow maldistribution over 10 parallel channels in each layer. Subsequently, an MDL-MCHS with an optimized header was fabricated using a metal 3D printer, and its thermal characteristics were experimentally evaluated in counterflow and parallel-flow operations under single-phase liquid flow and forced convective boiling conditions. The supplied heat flux was varied from 1.0 to 9.2 kW/m(2). Ethanol and acetone with a boiling point of 78.4 degrees C or 56 degrees C were identically fed into each layer in a flowrate ((V) over dot) range of 15-400 ml/h. At 9.2 kW/m(2) (11.5 suns), the counterflow operation of forced convective boiling attained temperature uniformity below 1.6 degrees C and 1.8 degrees C in the (V) over dot range of 25-100 ml/h for ethanol and 50-300 ml/h for acetone, respectively. The resultant wall temperature was nearly identical with the boiling point of operated coolant.

AB Renewable sources of energy are providing an increasing share of the electricity generation mix, but their intermittency drives a need for energy storage. At the same time, water resources are increasingly scarce due to changes in demand, such as from population growth, supply side pressures such as climate change and governance challenges relating to poor management. Large storage reservoirs are used for water management and for energy storage. However, some existing and proposed hydropower reservoirs require vast areas of land and have considerable social and environmental impacts. Growing concerns on water and energy storage from a water-energy-land nexus approach motivated this study. Our objective is to compare how energy and water storage services, such as hydropower generation, electricity grid and water management, are provided with Seasonal Pumped-Storage (SPS) and Conventional Reservoir Dams (CRD) plants. Our case study region is Brazil, a country with extensive hydropower capacity and development plans, for which we compare the cost, land requirement and social impacts between CRD and potential SPS plants. Whilst seasonal pumped-storage have higher capital costs than conventional reservoir dams, given the much lower land requirements and evaporative losses, they are a valuable water and energy storage alternative especially in locations with plain topography and high evaporation. Results show that if Sobradinho CRD was built today it would result in a $USD 1.46 billion loss, on the other hand, Muquem SPS plant would result in a $USD 0.67b revenue.

AB Awareness of climate change, fossil fuel availability, and pollutants has been growing which have pushed forward the effort in cleaner engines. In this aspect, the gasoline engines have more improving margin than diesel engines. To have a more efficient combustion, injection systems had evolved from old Port Fuel Injectors to modern Gasoline direct injections which are the used by engine manufacturers nowadays. In this study, within the framework of the Engine Combustion Network (ECN), the so named Spray G is modelled. This gasoline direct injector was developed by Delphi with the intention of getting a better understanding of the gasoline spray. The model is focused on the Rate of Injection (ROI) signal, whose results are presented in order to help engine calibration and modelling for an extensive range of configurations without the need for experimental measurements.

AB This study proposes an integrated framework for planning distributed energy system with addressing the multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria evaluation issues simultaneously. The framework can be decomposed into two stages. At the optimization stage, the system design and dispatch are optimized considering multiple objectives by E-constraint method. Three decision making approaches are applied to identify the Pareto optimal solution. At the evaluation stage, a combined Analytic Hierarchy Process and Gray Relation Analysis method is proposed to evaluate and rank various optimal solutions when different objectives and cases are considered. Two stages of work are integrated by introducing the baseline conditions. As an illustrative example, an optimal planning model for a solar-assisted Solid Oxide Fuel Cell distributed energy system is proposed by Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming approach firstly. Then, the system is applied to different cases considering two types of buildings located in three climate zones. The obtained optimal solutions are further evaluated by the proposed multi-criteria evaluation method. Therefore, the overall optimal system design and dispatch strategy, as well as the best demonstration site can be identified comprehensively considering multiple objectives. In general, the results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB Waste heat accounts nearly 50% of the total energy used in the industries. This low grade thermal energy is mostly available in the temperature range of 120-650 degrees C, which can be effectively utilized to produce power by which the consumption of the fossil fuels can be mitigated to a certain extent. The total solar irradiance measured by satellite is roughly found to be 1361 W/m(2) which can be effectively utilised. The conversion of heat to electricity is often carried out by heat engines and thermodynamic cycles also play a major role in utilising waste heat effectively. Among the thermodynamic cycles, organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is considered to be an effective approach in harnessing low grade thermal energy. ORC is used in heat recovery of low-temperature sources such as biomass combustion, industrial waste heat, and geothermal heat. The efficient operation of ORC depends on the working fluid and expander employed which determines the efficiency and power output of the cycle. Compared to experimentation works, modeling works are mostly studied in the case of ORC. Current review predominantly focuses on the review of various thermodynamic cycles for power production, working fluids that can be employed in the cycle, turbine selection and applications of ORC by employing it as topping or bottoming cycle in other primary heat or power cycles.

AB In current system of building energy efficiency, the building energy saving rate is calculated based on energy consumption per unit area on a certain past stage. The approach is restricted by the development of economy, progress of energy-saving technologies and climate change. In present work, a novel building energy efficiency evaluation index is developed to represent building energy saving performance. A building model can be first established according to architectural design scheme, current standards and operating conditions. Then, average daily indoor air temperature would be obtained using hourly outdoor air temperature as input conditions, with the one-dimensional unsteady heat transfer model. Finally, the calculation equations of energy saving of envelopes (Delta S) and building energy saving rate (BESR) are derived. In application, a building envelopes trade-off option is proposed and a target building in Western China is employed for case study. The results indicate that, about 19.3% of whole energy achieving indoor human thermal comfort is provided by building envelopes for the target building. The parametric analyses indicate that, BESRs of the standard building model in cold climate zone (2A) are much higher than those in cold climate zone (2B) in China. It is found that, the trade-off option can also be employed to select and optimize insulation materials and layer thicknesses. The approach can provide new thoughts for evaluation of energy saving performance of building envelopes in the design phase.

AB Developing an efficient one-pot catalytic process for biodiesel production from non-edible oils under mild reaction conditions remains challenging. Here, a novel process for the one-pot conversion of non-edible Firmiana platanifolio L.f. (FPLF) oil into biodiesel using inexpensive, scalable imidazolium salts-based solid acid containing both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites as the catalyst was investigated for the first time. The Bronsted-Lewis acid bifunctional catalyst ([DSI][FeCl4]) was synthesized facilely and atom-economically (the final product contains the high amounts of atoms from the reactants) from 1,3-disulfonic acid imidazolium chloride ([DSI][Cl]) with FeCl3 and was characterized by FT-IR, H-1 and C-13 NMR, N-2 adsorption-desorption, SEM-EDS, TEM, FT-IR of pyridine, NH3 -TPD, TGA and elemental analysis. Owing to the presence of immiscible phases of oil and methanol in the reaction mixture, the effects of various co-solvents on the conversion of the FPLF oil into biodiesel were investigated, with the aim of reducing the mass transfer resistance. The results demonstrated that biomass-derived tetrahydrofuran (THF) was a superior co-solvent and could improve the reaction rate and biodiesel yield. The reaction conditions were optimized by using response surface methodology (RSM), [DSI][FeCl4] exhibited excellent catalytic performance, with a high biodiesel yield of 98.7% under the following mild reaction conditions, which was superior to that of commercial resins (e.g., Amberlyst 15 and Nafion NR50). Detailed kinetic studies demonstrated that the catalytic process followed first-order kinetics and that the activation energy (83.56 kJ/mol) was relatively low compared to previous results. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the catalytic process was non-spontaneous and that the reaction was endothermic and endergonic. Intriguingly, the catalyst was a heterogeneous catalyst during the reaction and maintained high catalytic activity after four cycles. The fuel properties of biodiesels derived from FPLF oil complied with the corresponding ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards.

AB In the present study, an optimal power and freshwater cogeneration system is proposed to meet the global requirements sustainably. A Rankine cycle (RC), an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and a reverse osmosis (RO) module are integrated to form the proposed system. The performance of the system is investigated using thermo-mathematical models allocating seven organic fluids in the bottoming ORC. A novel evolutionary algorithm-based multi-objective optimization approach is applied using thermorisk and thermoeconomic analyses. Thus, an optimal configuration is determined at both global and local scales. Finally, a flexibility analysis is performed to the optimal configuration considering probable uncertainties in the market. The optimization results showed that the total accidental risk impact and the total product cost rate improved by 2.49-48.73% and 5.67-62.41%, respectively, depending on the employed organic fluid. The highest exergetic efficiency and the minimum specific power consumption were obtained as 52.74% and 4.111 kWh/m(3), allocating R245fa in the optimal system. The system enjoying R123 had the widest flexibility range without any increases in the optimum total product costs.

AB Cogeneration system based on cascade utilization of heat has been proved to be a promising technology to enhance energy conversion efficiency. An electricity-cooling cogeneration system (ECCS) based on coupling of a steam Rankine cycle (SRC) and an absorption refrigeration system (ARS) is proposed to recover the waste heat of marine engine to meet the electricity and cooling demand aboard. The SRC absorbed heat from the exhaust gas of engine to generate electricity, and the ARS makes use of the condensation heat of SRC to provide cooling needed on ship. Electricity output, cooling capacity, equivalent electricity output, exergy efficiency, and equivalent thermal efficiency are adopted to evaluate the performance of ECCS. The simulation results indicate that recovering the expansion work in the absorption refrigeration cycle is an effective way to increase electricity output at the cost of decreasing cooling capacity. The equivalent electricity output of the WHR system is 5223 kW, accounting for 7.61% of the rated power output of the marine engine.

AB The study proposes a new approach to analyze the impact of industry sectors on the composition of business ecosystems from an industry-wide perspective based on data on strategic alliances and joint ventures. In this study, ARM (association rule mining) is adopted as a basis to construct an inter-industry knowledge flow matrix that represents interactions among industry sectors involved in inter-firm relationships, and the DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) technique is used to determine the specific characteristics of the resulting inter-industry interactions, such as impact and cause effect relationships. Moreover, centrality-based indicators are introduced to categorize the specific roles of industry sectors by means of social network analysis. The approach is a good complement to the patent-dominated methodological tools to analyzing interdisciplinary convergence trends and exploring the structure of overall business ecosystem. Additionally, it will help policy makers to develop effective policies for maintaining balanced resource flows across sectors and for developing sustainable ecosystem structure.

AB This paper deals with the mobile robots path planning problem in the presence of scattered obstacles in a visually known environment. Utilizing the theory of charged particles' potential fields and inspired by a key idea of the authors' recent work, an optimization based approach is proposed to obtain an optimal and robust path planning solution. By assigning a potential function for each individual obstacle, the interaction of all scattered obstacles are integrated in a scalar potential surface (SPS) which strongly depends on the physical features of the mobile robot and obstacles. The optimum path is then obtained from a cost function optimization by attaining a trade-off between traversing the shortest path and avoiding collisions, simultaneously. Hence, irrespective of any physical constraint! on the obstacles/mobile-robot and the adjacency of the target to the obstacles, the achieved results demonstrate a feasible, fast, oscillation-free and collision-free path planning of the proposed method. Utilizing a scalar decision variable makes it extremely simple in terms of mathematical computations and thus practically feasible that can be applied to both static and dynamic environments. Finally, simulation results verified the performance and fulfillment of the mentioned objectives of the approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A bi-objective Fuel efficient Green Vehicle Routing Problem (F-GVRP) with varying speed constraint is discussed in this paper as an extension of Green Vehicle Routing Problem (G-VRP). F-GVRP is modelled to minimize both route cost and fuel consumption using goal programming. The problem is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization with Greedy Mutation Operator and Time varying acceleration coefficient (TVa-PSOGMO). The objective of this paper is to study the behaviour of F-GVRP under varying speed environment and its impact on the route cost and fuel consumption. Experiments are conducted with constant and varying speed constraints and it is observed that better routing plan with minimum fuel consumption can be achieved under varying speed environment.

During the process of hierarchy structure construction, our method delays node judgment of the uncertain category until it can be classified clearly. This approach effectively alleviates the 'block' problem which transfers the classification error from the higher level to the lower level in the hierarchy structure. A new term weighting approach based on the Least Information Theory (LIT) is adopted for the hierarchy classification. It quantifies information in probability distribution changes and offers a new document representation model where the contribution of each term can be properly weighted. The experimental results show that the relaxation approach builds a more reasonable hierarchy and further improves classification performance. It also outperforms other classification methods such as SVM (Support Vector Machine) in terms of efficiency and the approach is more efficient for large-scale text classification tasks. Compared to the classic term weighting method TF*IDF, LIT-based methods achieves significant improvement on the classification performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID COEFFICIENTS
AB This research proposed a mathematical method to identify TRIZ solution models to given problems based on similarity measures. Quantitative methods were used to allow the users quickly and objectively obtaining solution models to a problem with priority based on existing effects and solved effect case base which is the accumulation of many expert knowledge and experiences instead of individual expert's knowledge. Similarity concept was used to determine the relevant effects and related solved cases as solution models. A total of 210 known cases and 70 effects from scientific website/knowledge database are verified with the author's research team for solution generation. By conducting a 3-fold verification of the 210 cases, the ten highest similarity solution models provided a hit rate exceeding 87.6% coverage of original solutions. This substantially exceeded the 23.8% hit rate of ten randomly selected solutions covering original solutions. The ten worst similarity solution only provided 0% hit rate.
   This provides a paradigm shift in research direction for TRIZ-based research from logical reasoning to quantitative calculations contributing to TRIZ recognition in scientific fields. The contributions of this study include: 1) Using the problem characteristics array and solution characteristics array based on technical effects to enable mathematical computations for prioritized effect solutions instead of traditional qualitative reasoning and non-prioritized excessively large number of suggestions. 2) Providing a means to continually accumulate expert knowledge and experience by integrating more expert-solved cases to provide users a rapid, objective, and effective problem-solving system. This implies a continuous learning system which uses cumulative knowledge from many experts objectively instead of otherwise knowledge from individual experts. 3) Enhancing existing 39 parameters to 78 parameters and increasing existing 36 functions to 61 functions to cover more problem solving situations.

AB Closing the semantic gap in medical image analysis is critical. Access to large-scale datasets might help to narrow the gap. However, large and balanced datasets may not always be a bailable. On the other side, retrieving similar images from an archive is a valuable task to facilitate better diagnosis. In this work, we concentrate on forming a search space, consisting of the most similar images for a given query, to be used for a similarity-based search technique in a retrieval system. We propose a two-step hierarchical shrinking search space when local binary patterns are used. Transfer learning via convolutional neural networks is utilized for the first stage of search space shrinking, followed by creating a selection pool using Radon transform for further reduction. The difference between two orthogonal Radon projections is considered in the selection pool to extract more information. The IRMA dataset, from ImageCLEF initiative, containing 14,400 X-ray images, is used to validate the proposed scheme. We report a total IRMA error of 168.05 (or 90.30% accuracy) which is the best result compared with existing methods in the literature for this dataset when real-time processing is considered.

AB The effects of exogenous ATP on the postharvest quality, browning and softening of mung bean (Vigna radiata) sprouts were evaluated. ATP treatment significantly alleviated the quality loss and browning events during the storage of 3 days. It also reduced the oxidant damage by inducing high activities of peroxidase (9.3-13.9%) and superoxide dismutase (8.8-10.3%) which scavenged the reactive oxygen species (ROS) effectively. Transcriptional results indicated that ATP treatment decreased VrPL1, VrPME and VrPG1 gene expression levels more than 2 folds at some time points. Furthermore, the atomic force microscope (AFM) images revealed that the pectin degradation was notably slowed by ATP treatment and the width and height of pectin backbone were better maintained (47.1% and 45.6% higher than control without ATP treatment). The cooperative effects of ROS scavenging and decreased expressions of pectin-related genes might contribute to the deferred pectin deterioration and firmness loss by ATP treatment.

AB The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative edible coating, based on chitosan from mushrooms enriched with procyanidins extracted from grape seeds, on fresh blueberry quality maintenance, (weight loss, pH, dry matter, colour, firmness and antioxidant activity) and microbial growth, during 14 days of storage at 4 degrees C.
   For weight loss, pH and dry matter no relevant differences were detected among the control and the differently coated samples at each considered storage time. Chitosan and chitosan + procyanidins coatings promoted a slight decrease of luminosity and an increase of blue hue colour of blueberry samples during the whole storage period. The use of coating promoted an increase in the antiradical activity that was the highest in blueberries coated with chitosan + procyanidins. Microbiological analysis results indicated that the chitosan-based coated samples had a significantly higher yeast and mould growth inhibition compared to the uncoated sample.

AB Efficiency and effectiveness of collagen extraction process contribute to huge impacts to the quality, supply and cost of the collagen produced. Jellyfish is a potential sustainable source of collagen where their applications are not limited by religious constraints and threats of transmittable diseases. The present study compared the extraction yield, physico-chemical properties and toxicology in vitro of collagens obtained by the conventional acid-assisted and pepsin-assisted extraction to an improved physical-aided extraction process. By increasing physical intervention, the production yield increased significantly compared to the conventional extraction processes (p < .05). Collagen extracted using the improved process was found to possess similar proximate and amino acids composition to those extracted using pepsin (p > .05) while retaining high molecular weight distributions and polypeptide profiles similar to those extracted using only acid. Moreover, they exhibited better appearance, instrumental colour and were found to be non-toxic in vitro and free of heavy metal contamination.

AB Turmeric contains curcumin and its analogues, which show anticancer and antiinflammatory effects; however, curcuminoids are lipophilic and are poorly absorbed by the human body. Nanostructured lipid carriers for encapsulating whole turmeric powder were successfully produced by ultrasonication, and their physicochemical properties and stability in simulated gastric and intestinal media were evaluated. The turmeric nanostructured lipid carriers (TNLCs) exhibited a round shape, small diameter (282 +/- 7.19 nm), adequate zeta potential (-22.75 +/- 1.20 mV), and high encapsulation efficiency (93.3 +/- 0.01%). The TNLCs were able to protect the encapsulated curcuminoids under acidic gastric conditions, and effectively released 95 +/- 2.51% of the curcuminoids in the simulated intestinal medium, demonstrating their suitability for controlled release. The in vitro bioaccessibility of the encapsulated curcuminoids was 75 +/- 1.24%, representing more than a fourfold increase compared to that of free turmeric. Therefore, the proposed TNLCs are a promising delivery system for increasing the bioaccessibility of curcuminoids from turmeric.

AB Tubers from a genetically modified high-amylose line T-2012 and its parental potato cultivar Dinamo were analyzed for resistant starch (RS) and dietary fiber (DF) after cooking and cold storage. For uncooked potatoes, the high-amylose tubers (30% of dry matter, DM) had much lower RS than the parent tubers (56% of DM). However, after cooking, the high-amylose tubers gave more RS (13% of DM) than the parent (4% of DM), and the RS level increased further to about 20% of DM after 1 day of cold storage. The altered RS content was attributable to changes in amylose content, starch granule structure, and amylopectin structure induced by the genetic modification. The high-amylose tubers also contained more DF (10-14% of DM) than the parent (5-7% of DM). Furthermore, cell wall composition was indirectly affected by the genetic modification, giving more cellulose and less pectin in the high-amylose tubers than the parent.

AB Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were investigated as an extraction medium for one-step sample preparation for chemical characterization of peppermint (Mentha piperita L.). Rather than applying discontinuous, time-consuming extraction methods to prepare two types of extracts, peppermint leaves were extracted efficiently into a DES, which was composed of choline chloride and D-(+)-glucose at a 5:2 molar ratio. The produced peppermint extracts contained volatile monoterpenes and phenolics at levels sufficient for direct chemical examination of peppermint leaves. The extracted monoterpenes in DES could be quantified via a newly developed method based on headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography. The same extracts were also directly used to assess phenolics in terms of total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity. The proposed method allowed one-step sample preparation for extraction of volatile monoterpenes and phenolics of peppermint leaves and could be applied to various peppermint samples obtained from different origins.

AB Korat-chicken breast and thigh were subjected to heating at 70, 100 or 121 degrees C for 30 min and simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. At 70 or 100 degrees C heating, digests of breast possessed higher ACE inhibitory activity than those of thigh. The highest ACE inhibitory activity was found in the digest of breast cooked at 70 degrees C (B/H-70), whereas breast heated at 121 degrees C (B/H-121) exhibited the lowest. The 1-kDa permeate of the B/H-70 digest revealed higher permeability through colorectal adenocarcinoma monolayers and ACE inhibitory activity than did B/H-121. Among nine transported peptides, APP derived from myosin showed the highest ACE inhibition, with a non-competitive characteristic (K-i 0.93 mu M). Molecular docking showed that APP interacts with ACE via hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. In conclusion, mild thermal treatment of chicken breast resulted in a higher amount of transported peptides, exerting higher ACE inhibitory activity, which could lead to potential health benefits.

AB Garlic is a valuable source of healthy compounds, including secondary metabolites rich in sulphur such as cysteine sulphoxides (CSOs). Here, we present new qRT-PCR assays analysing the transcription of two genes encoding key enzymes in CSO biosynthetic pathways (cysteine synthase and alliinase) in developing garlic. We also identified a set of genes (ACT I, GAPDH, and TUB) to use as transcription normalisation controls. We showed that the (normalised) transcription of both enzymes was highest during sprouting and decreased significantly in fully developed leaves, which are the major CSO-producing organs. Transcriptional activity further declined at the end of the growing season. Different cultivars show similar sulphur metabolism gene expression when European garlics were compared to Chinese and American genotypes. The qRT-PCR assays presented are also suitable for investigating the effects of agricultural practices on CSO formation in garlic to satisfy consumer demands.

AB ADAMTS3 is a member of procollagen N-proteinase subfamily of ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) gene family. It has an important function in the procollagen maturation process. The removal of N-peptidases is required for the accurate processing of fibrillar collagens. Otherwise, several disorders can occur that is related with the collagenous tissues. ADAMTS3 mainly maturates type II collagen molecule which is the main component of the bone and cartilage. There are several expression studies about ADAMTS3 gene however its transcriptional regulation has not been lightened up, yet. Here we first time cloned and functionally analyzed the promoter region of ADAMTS3 gene, approximately 1380 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Transient transfection experiments showed that all truncated promoter constructs are active and 171 bp fragment is sufficient to activate gene expression in both Saos-2 and MG63 cells. In silico analysis showed that ADAMTS3 has a TATA-less promoter and contains several SP1/GC box binding motifs and a CpG island. Therefore we mainly investigated the SP1 dependent regulation of ADAMTS3 promoter. SP1 downregulated ADAMTS3 transcriptional activity. As consistent with the transcriptional activity, mRNA, and protein expression levels were also decreased by SP1. On the other hand, functional binding of the SP1 on multiple regions of ADAMTS3 promoter was confirmed by EMSA studies. As ADAMTS3 is responsible for the collagen maturation and biosynthesis, further we investigated the effect of SP1 on type I II and III collagen gene expressions. We point out that SP1 increased type II and III collagen expression and in contrast decreased type I collagen expression levels in Saos-2 cells. mRNA expression level was decreased for all collagen types in MG63 model. Decrease in the type II collagen expression was also demonstrated at the protein level by SP1. Collectively these results provide first findings for the SP1-related transcriptional regulation of ADAMTS3 and collagen genes in osteosarcoma cell lines.

AB The marine environment around Japan experienced significant changes during the Cenozoic Era. In this study, we report findings suggesting that this dynamic history left behind traces in the genome of the Japanese sand dollar species Peronella japonica and P. rubra. Although mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase I sequences did not indicate fragmentation of the current local populations of P. japonica around Japan, two different types of intron sequence were found in the Abel locus. We inferred that past fragmentation of the populations account for the presence of two types of nuclear sequences as alleles in the Alx1 intron of P. japonica. It is likely that the split populations have intermixed in recent times; hence, we did not detect polymorphisms in the sequences reflecting the current localization of the species. In addition, we found two allelic sequences of theA/x1 intron in the sister species P. rubra. The divergence times of the two types of Aba intron sequences were estimated at approximately 14.9 and 4.0 million years ago for P. japonica and P. rubra, respectively. Our study indicates that information from the intron sequences of nuclear genes can enhance our understanding of past genetic events in organisms.

AB Investigating the potential biological function of differential changed genes through integrating multiple omits data including miRNA and mRNA expression profiles, is always hot topic. However, how to evaluate the repression effect on target genes integrating miRNA and mRNA expression profiles are not fully solved. In this study, we provide an analyzing method by integrating both miRNAs and mRNAs expression data simultaneously. Difference analysis was adopted based on the repression score, then significantly repressed mRNAs were screened out by DEGseq. Pathway analysis for the significantly repressed mRNAs shows that multiple pathways such as MAPK signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway and so on, may correlated to the colorectal cancer (CRC). Focusing on the MAPK signaling pathway, a miRNA-mRNA network that centering the cell fate genes was constructed. Finally, the miRNA-mRNAs that potentially important in the CRC carcinogenesis were screened out and scored by impact index.

AB Recently, long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been emerged as pivotal regulators in various human cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). SPRY4-intronic transcript 1 (SPRY4-IT1) was reported to be upregulated in some kind of human cancers. Here, we elucidated the biological functions and possible clinical values of SPRY4-IT1 on PDAC. In present study, expression of SPRY4-IT1 in PDAC tissues and corresponding normal tissues were explored by qRT-PCR experiments. The link between SPRY4-IT1 expression levels and clinicopathological significance was further analyzed. In addition, the oncogenic role of SPRY4-IT1 was detected both in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that SPRY4-IT1 was abnormally upregulated in PDAC tissues and cell lines. Tumor stage and differentiation grade was closely correlated with SPRY4-IT1 expression. Additionally, decreased SPRY4-IT1 contributed to tumor suppressive effect through attenuating cell growth, clonogenic ability and facilitating apoptosis via Bcl-2/caspase-3 pathway in PANC1 and Capan-2 cells. Furthermore, the xenograft study confirmed the tumor proliferation-promoting role of SPRY4-IT1 in PANC1 cells. Taken together, these findings indicated that SPRY4-IT1 is a potential therapeutic target and prognosis biomarker for the patients with PDAC.

AB The giant clam, Tridacna squamosa, represents a clam-zooxanthellae association. In light, the host clam and the symbiotic zooxanthellae conduct light-enhanced calcification and photosynthesis, respectively. We had cloned the cDNA coding sequence of a Vacuolar-type Proton ATPase (VHA) subunit A, ATP6V1A, from T. squamosa, whereby the VHA is an electrogenic transporter that actively 'pumps' H+ out of the cell. The ATP6V1A of T. squamosa comprised 1866 bp, encoding a protein of 622 amino acids and 69.9 kDa, and had a host-origin. Its gene expression was strong in the ctenidium and the colorful outer mantle, but weak in the whitish inner mantle, corroborating a previous proposition that VHA might have a trivial role in light-enhanced calcification. Light exposure led to significant increases in the gene and protein expression levels of ATP6V/A/ATP6V1A in the ctenidium and the outer mantle. In the ctenidium, the ATP6V1A was localized in the apical epithelia of the filaments and tertiary water channels, indicating that the VHA could participate in the increased excretion of H+ produced during light-enhanced calcification. Additionally, the excreted H+ would augment HCO3- dehydration in the external medium and facilitate the uptake of CO2 by the ctenidium during insolation. In the outer mantle, the ATP6V1A was detected in intracellular vesicles in a type of cells, presumably iridocytes, surrounding the zooxanthellal tubules, and in the apical epithelium of zooxanthellal tubules. Hence, the host VHA could participate in the transfer of inorganic carbon from the hemolymph to the luminal fluid of the tubules by increasing the supply of H+ for the dehydration of HCO3 to CO2 during insolation to benefit the photosynthesizing zooxanthellae.

AB Recent achievements in the genetic diagnosis of Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) have disclosed rare variants in numerous genes encoding different types of myocardial proteins. However, the causative gene underlying the pathogenesis of about 60% of familial cases with DCM has not been identified. One novel gene introduced in 2016 for cardiac-restricted DCM is FLNC. In this study, we applied Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics-based methods to a member of an extended non-consanguineous family with DCM history accompanied with fatal arrhythmia in at least four consecutive generations. We found a novel splice-site mutation in FLNC gene (c.2389 + 1G > A) which cosegregated with all symptomatic individuals in the family. Computational prediction software tools as well as RT-PCR method were used to evaluate the impact of the FLNC splice site mutation. This substitution leads to exon 15th donor-site disruption and exon skipping, which would result in a premature stop codon three aminocids downstream of the mutation site. The aberrantly mRNA transcript can induce nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Although carrier individuals show remarkable variable expression regarding the severity of DCM as well as the disease age of onset, a highly penetrant fatal arrhythmia was found to be shared between them. We strongly suggest that the involvement of FLNC gene, due to haploinsufficiency, should be considered in familial cases with DCM, especially if accompanied with arrhythmia and increased incidence of sudden cardiac death.

AB Closed-loop drug delivery promises autonomous control of pharmacotherapy through the continuous monitoring of biomarker levels. For decades, researchers have strived for portable closed-loop systems capable of treating ambulatory patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus. After years of development, the first of these systems have left the laboratory and entered commercial use. This long-awaited advance reflects recent development of chronically stable implantable biosensors able to accurately measure biomarker levels in vivo. This review discusses the role of implantable biosensors in closed-loop drug delivery applications, with the intent to provide a resource for engineers and researchers studying such systems. We provide an overview of common biosensor designs and review the principle challenges in implementing long indwelling sensors: namely device sensitivity, selectivity, and lifetime. This review examines novel advances in transducer design, biological interface, and material biocompatibility, with a focus on recent academic and commercial work which provide successful strategies to overcome perennial challenges. This review focuses primarily on the topics of closed-loop glucose control and continuous glucose monitoring biosensors, which make up the overwhelming majority of published research in this area. We conclude with an overview of recent advances in closed-loop systems targeting applications outside blood glucose management.

AB Controlled drug delivery systems are able to improve efficacy and safety of therapeutics by optimizing the duration and kinetics of release. Among them, closed-loop delivery strategies, also known as self-regulated administration, have proven to be a practical tool for homeostatic regulation, by tuning drug release as a function of biosignals relevant to physiological and pathological processes. A typical example is glucose-responsive insulin delivery system, which can mimic the pancreatic beta cells to release insulin with a proper dose at a proper time point by responding to plasma glucose levels. Similar self-regulated systems are also important in the treatment of other diseases including thrombosis and bacterial infection. In this review, we survey the recent advances in bioresponsive closed-loop drug delivery systems, including glucose-responsive, enzyme-activated, and other biosignal-mediated delivery systems. We also discuss the future opportunities and challenges in this field.

AB Cystinosis is an orphan disease caused by a genetic mutation that leads to deposition of cystine crystals in many organs including cornea. Ophthalmic manifestation of the disease can be treated with hourly instillation of cysteamine eye drops. The hourly eye drop instillation is tedious to the patients leading to poor compliance and additionally, significant degradation of the drug occurs within one week of opening the bottle, which further complicates this delivery approach. This paper focuses on designing a contact lens to treat the disease with improved efficacy compared to eye drops, and also exploring safety of the drug eluding contact lens in an animal model. Our goal is to design a lens that is safe and that can deliver a daily therapeutic dose of cysteamine to the cornea while retaining drug stability. We show that cysteamine diffuses out rapidly from all lenses due to its small size. Vitamin E incorporation increases the release duration of both ACUVUE (R) OASYS (R) and ACUVUE (R) TruEyeTM but the effect is more pronounced in TruEyeTM likely due to the low solubility of vitamin E in the lens matrix and higher aspect ratio of the barriers. The barriers are not effective in hydrogel lenses, which along with the high aspect ratio in silicone hydrogels suggests that barriers could be forming at the interface of the silicone and hydrogel phases. The presence of vitamin E has an additional beneficial effect of reduction in the oxidation rates, likely due to a transport barrier between the oxygen diffusing through the silicone channels and drug located in the hydrogel phase. Based on this study, both Acuvue (R) OASYS (R) and ACUVUE (R) TruEye (TM) can be loaded with vitamin E to design a cysteamine eluting contact lenses for effective therapy of cystinosis. The lenses must be worn for about 4-5 hr. each day, which is less than the typical duration of daily-wear. The vitamin E and cysteamine loaded lenses did not exhibit any toxicity in a rabbit model over a period of 7-days.

AB The role of two and three-dimensional printing as a fabrication technology for sophisticated transdermal drug delivery systems is explored in literature. 3D printing encompasses a family of distinct technologies that employ a virtual model to produce a physical object through numerically controlled apparatuses. The applicability of several printing technologies has been researched for the direct or indirect printing of microneedle arrays or for the modification of their surface through drug-containing coatings. The findings of the respective studies are presented. The range of printable materials that are currently used or potentially can be employed for 3D printing of transdermal drug delivery (TDD) systems is also reviewed. Moreover, the expected impact and challenges of the adoption of 3D printing as a manufacturing technique for transdermal drug delivery systems, are assessed. Finally, this paper outlines the current regulatory framework associated with 3D printed transdermal drug delivery systems.

AB In this study, polymeric microneedle patches were fabricated by stereolithography, a 3D printing technique, for the transdermal delivery of insulin. A biocompatible resin was photopolymerized to build pyramid and cone microneedle designs followed by inkjet print coating of insulin formulations. Trehalose, mannitol and xylitol were used as drug carriers with the aim to preserve insulin integrity and stability but also to facilitate rapid release rates. Circular dichroism and Raman analysis demonstrated that all carriers maintained the native form of insulin, with xylitol presenting the best performance. Franz cell release studies were used for in vitro determination of insulin release rates in porcine skin. Insulin was released rapidly within 30 min irrespectively of the microneedle design. 3D printing was proved an effective technology for the fabrication of biocompatible and scalable microneedle patches.

The geometry of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) plane which varies along the strike of the Himalaya in flat and ramp segments with a dip ranging between similar to 2.5 to similar to 4 degrees to similar to 19 degrees below the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) in the south to the South Tibetan Detachment (STD) in the north has also been deduced in this study. Two crustal ramps were reported in this study with a depth variance below the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and to the South Tibetan Detachment (STD) between 12 to 22 km and 28 to 40 km depth respectively. The estimated earthquake potential prevailing in the western Himalayan seismic gap lying between the epicentral zone of the 1905 Kangra earthquake and the 1975 Kinnaur earthquake reveals that the total amount of energy released since the last great event is only a fraction (3-5%) of the accommodated energy i.e.1.1E + 28 dyne-cm/yr. This suggests that if an earthquake hits this NW Himalayan segment in the future, its magnitude might be around Mw >= 8.0.

AB The fluvio-lacustrine sequence in the Lanzhou Basin, located at the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, is a rich source of Oligocene -Miocene mammalian fossils, critical to our understanding of the terrestrial Asian mammal and environmental evolution. While the Miocene mammalian faunas have been dated with magnetostratigraphy, the numerical age of the Oligocene faunas remains controversial. Here, we present new high resolution magnetostratigraphic records from two fluvio-lacustrine sections in the central Lanzhou Basin, which provide age constraints for two Oligocene mammal assemblages in the Lower Xianshuihe Formation, the Nanpoping and Xiagou Faunas. The Lower Xianshuihe Formation is suggested to span from polarity chrons Cl 2r to C7n, ranging from ca 31 Ma to 24 Ma. The Early Oligocene Nanpoping Fauna correlates to the C12r-Clln.2n polarity citron intervals, yielding an age of similar to 31-30 Ma, while the Late Oligocene Xiagou Fauna correlates to chrons C7An-C8n.2n, with an age of similar to 26-25 Ma. This magnetostratigraphy provides a more accurate age than biochronology for the Oligocene giant mammal Indricotheriinae contained in the Nanpoping Fauna and sheds new light on the chronology and distribution of Indricotheriinae in Eurasia. The faunas, in particular the Nanpoping Fauna, suggest a mixed setting of woodlands and grasslands associated with a humid environment in the Lanzhou Basin during Early Oligocene, in contrast to its present arid environment with few woodlands.

AB Despite the links of Asian monsoon with climates at high northern and southern latitudes, it remains unclear that at which time and to what extent the Asian monsoon variation is dominated by one of the two drivers throughout a Greenland Stadial (GS) to Greenland Interstadial (GI) cycle. Here we provide a Chinese stalagmite delta O-18 record to study their teleconnections throughout the GS-6 to GI-5.2 cycle. The resemblance between the stalagmite and Greenland records, in timing, duration and abruptness of GI-5.2, supports that the occurrence and termination of GIs are paced by the northern driving force. During the intervals of GI-5.2 and GS-6, however, the Asian monsoon fluctuated concomitantly with variation in temperature over Antarctica, instead of over Greenland. This covariation indicates dominant influences of the Antarctic climate during the climatically stable intervals of stadials and interstadials. This study updates our knowledge on mechanical dynamics of the Asian monsoon change and global climate change throughout a GS to GI cycle.

AB The Purang harzburgite massif in SW Tibet (China) hosts abundant chrome ore deposits. Ores consist of 20 to > 95% modal chromian spinel (Cr-spinel) with mylonitic fabric in imbricate shaped pods. The composition of Cr-spinel in these ores ranges from Al-rich [Cr#(Sp) or Cr/(Cr + Al) x 100 = 47.60-57.56] to Cr-rich (Cr#(Sp): 62.55-79.57). Bulk platinum-group element (PGE) contents of chromitites are also highly variable ranging from 17.5 ppb to similar to 2.5 ppm. Both metallurgical and refractory chromitites show a general enrichment in the IPGE (Os, Ir and Ru) with respect to the PPGE (Rh, Pt and Pd), resulting mostly in right-sloping primitive mantle (PM) normalized PGE profiles. The platinum-group mineral (PGM) assemblages of both chromitite types are dominated by heterogeneously distributed, euhedral Os-bearing laurite inclusions in Cr-spinel. The Purang chromitites have quite inhomogeneous Os-187/Os-188 ratios (0.12289-0.13194) that are within the range of those reported for mantle-hosted chromitites from other peridotite massifs.
   Geochemical calculations demonstrate that the parental melts of high-Cr chromitites were boninitic, whereas those of high-Al chromitites had an arc-type tholeiitic affinity. Chromite crystallization was most likely stimulated by changes in magma compositions due to melt-peridotite interaction, leading to the establishment of a heterogeneous physicochemical environment during the early crystallization of the PGM. The highly variable PGE contents, inhomogeneous Os-isotopic compositions and varying Cr#(sp) ratios of these chromitites imply a polygenetic origin for them from spatially distinct melt inputs. The generally low gamma Os values ( < 1) of chromitites indicate that their parental melts originated within different sections of a heterogeneously depleted mantle source region. These melts were most likely produced in the mantle wedge above a downgoing lithospheric slab.

AB To decipher cooling events in the West Junggar region, biotite and K-feldspar Ar-40/Ar-39, and zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He isotopic analyses of intrusive rocks were carried out. Previous U-Pb data showed that intrusive bodies in the Baogutu area were emplaced at 315-310 Ma. U-Pb and zircon (U-Th)/He dating results (313-241 Ma) suggest that a magmatic-hydrothermal event lasted for 72 Ma in the Baogutu area of the West Junggar region. Early-stage high temperature alteration (900-300 degrees C) lasted for 6-2 Ma and was followed by prolonged phyllic and argillic alteration lasting 67-63 Ma between 350 and 200 degrees C. Finally, slower cooling occurred between 200 and 70 degrees C, accompanied by post-mineralization uplift and erosion. In this study, three main episodes of relatively rapid cooling were distinguished in the West Junggar region, i.e. late Carboniferous-early Permian (307-277 Ma), middle Triassic (241-232 Ma) and early Cretaceous (145-120 Ma). The first rapid cooling during the late Carboniferous-early Permian was possibly associated with the release of magmatic heat. The middle Triassic and early Cretaceous cooling and exhumation are interpreted as a response to collision(s) between the Qiangtang and Kunlun-Qaidam or Lhasa blocks. The Cenozoic India-Eurasia collision, however, may have had little or no effect on modem tectonic reactivation of the West Junggar region.

AB The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) represents one of the most important sites of juvenile crustal growth during the Phanerozoic. Located in the central part of the CAOB, the Chinese Altai and Eastern Junggar terranes record the collisional processes between the peri-Siberian and Kazakhstan orogenic systems. However, the precise timing of collision between the two terranes remains controversial. The Wukuli and Kadelat plutons in the Chinese Altai belt are dated at similar to 305 and similar to 280 Ma respectively, whereas the Aketas pluton in the Eastern Junggar terrane is dated at 308 Ma. Granites from the Wukuli and Kadelat plutons are strongly peraluminous (A/CNK > 1.1), and are characterized by low Al2O3, Na2O, MnO, MgO, CaO and heavy rare earth element (HREE) contents, but with high SiO2, K2O and Rb contents as well as high Rb/Sr ratios. Granites from the Wukuli pluton have low epsilon(Nd)(t) and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -3.7 to -3.4 and -9.7 to + 4.9, whereas those from the Kadelat pluton have values of - 3.6 to - 3.4 and - 8.0 to + 2.6. These features suggest S-type affinity for the Wukuli and Kadelat plutons with magma derivation through partial melting of Mesoproterozoic metasediments. The Aketas pluton is composed of weakly peraluminous quartz monzonites that have A/CNK values ranging from 0.92 to 1.08, with high Na2O, Sr, and Sr/Y, and low Y, Yb, Nb, and Ta. These rocks display positive eNd(t) (+4.8 to + 6.4) and elif(t) (+ 9.7 to + 14.6) values, and low initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.703357-0.703868), similar to modern adakites, suggesting that the quartz monzonites were derived from the partial melting of lower crustal material. The geochemical characteristics suggest that the Aketas pluton was formed in a subduction-related setting, the Wukuli pluton in a syn-collisional setting, and the Kadelat pluton in the subsequent post-orogenic strike-slip-related setting. In combination with data from other granitoids in these two terranes, the Aketas pluton represents the youngest record of subduction-related environments, suggesting that the final collision between the Chinese Altai and Eastern Junggar terranes might have occurred between 308 and 304 Ma.

AB The Allay Mountains within the Xinjiang region of northwestern China hosts major metallic ore deposits. Here we review the geological characteristics, metallogenic features and tectonic settings of these deposits. The metallic ore deposits in the Allay Mountains occur mainly within four regions: North Altay, Central Altay, South Altay and Ellis. We recognize seven types of metallic ore deposits in the Altay Mountains: VMS, submarine volcanogenic iron, magmatic, skarn, pegmatite, hydrothermal vein (Cu-Zn, Fe) and orogenic gold. Among these types, the VMS, pegmatite, orogenic gold and skarn deposits are the most common. Most of the rare metal pegmatite deposits are distributed in Central Altay, with only a few in South Altay. The VMS, submarine volcanogenic type iron and skarn-type deposits are distributed in South Altay, whereas the orogenic-type gold deposits are distributed in the Ergis Fault belt. The hydrothermal vein-type deposits occur in the Ergis Fault belt and Chonghu'er Basin in South Altay. Magmatic-type deposits are mostly in the Ergis Fault belt and Central Allay. Based on isotopic age data, the VMS, submarine volcanogenic-type Fe and skam-type Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe mineralization occurred during Early Middle Devonian (similar to 410-377 Ma), orogenic-type Au, magmatic-type Cu Ni, and a small number of skarn-type Fe, hydrothermal vein-type Cu Zn, pegmatite-type rare-metal deposits in Early Middle Permian (293-261 Ma), pegmatite-type rare-metal deposits, few skarn-type Fe deposit in Early Middle Triassic (248-232 Ma), and dominantly represented by pegmatite-type rare-metal deposits in Late Triassic Early Jurassic (223-180 Ma). The metallic ore deposits in the Altay Mountains formed in various tectonic settings, such as the Early Middle Devonian continental arc and oceanic island arc, Early Middle Permian post-collisional extensional setting, and Triassic Early Jurassic intracontinental setting.

TI Collision of the Tacheng block with the Mayile-Barleik-Tangbale

AB Western Junggar in NW China, located to the southeast of the Boshchekul-Chingiz (BC) Range and to the north of the Chu-Balkhash-Yili microcontinent (CBY), played a key role in the architectural development of the western Altaids. However, the mutual tectonic relationships have been poorly constrained. In this paper, we present detailed mapping, field structural geology, and geochemical data from the Barleik-Mayile-Tangbale Complex (BMTC) in Western Junggar. The Complex is divisible into Zones I, II and III, which are mainly composed of Cambrian-Silurian rocks. Zone I contains pillow lava, siliceous shale, chert, coral-bearing limestone, sandstone and purple mudstone. Zone II consists of basaltic lava, siliceous shale, chert, sandstone and mudstone. Zone III is characterized by basalt, chest, sandstone and mudstone. These rocks represent imbricated ocean plate stratigraphy, which have been either tectonically juxtaposed by thrusting or form a m lange with a block-in matrix structure. All these relationships suggest that the BMTC is an Early-Middle Paleozoic accretionary complex in the eastern extension of the BC Range. These Early Paleozoic oceanic rocks were thrust onto Silurian sediments forming imbricate thrust stacks that are unconformably overlain by Devonian limestone, conglomerate and sandstone containing fossils of brachiopoda, crinoidea, bryozoa, and plant stems and leaves. The tectonic vergence of overturned folds in cherts, drag-related curved cleavages and a-type structures on the main thrust surface suggests top-to-the-NW transport. Moreover, the positive epsilon Nd(t) values of volcanic rocks from the Tacan-1 drill-core, and the positive eHf(t) values and post-Cambrian ages of detrital zircons from Silurian and Devonian strata to the south of the Tacheng block indicate that its basement is a depleted and juvenile lithosphere. And there was a radial outward transition from coral-bearing shallow marine (shelf) to deep ocean (pelagic) environments, and from OIB/E-MORB to N-MORB lava geochemistry away from the Tacheng block. Comparisons with published data suggest that these positive isotopic values, stratigraphic, structural and geochemical relationships can be best understood as an analogue of the relationships between the Ontong Java oceanic plateau and the Pacific oceanic crust. Therefore we propose that the basement of the Tacheng block was an Early Paleozoic oceanic plateau. The southern part of the Tacheng block was an accretionary complex and the northern part was an oceanic basin in the Early Paleozoic, the configuration of which is similar to that of the present Ontong Java oceanic plateau situated on the Pacific oceanic crust, and its accretion into the Solomon accretionary complex. The presence of Ordovician SSZ-type ophiolites, early Paleozoic blueschist and Silurian SSZ-type intrusions in the BMTC, and Early-Middle Paleozoic continental arc-related intrusive rocks in the northern margin of the CBY provide further corroboration of a former subduction zone between the southern West Junggar and the northern margin of the CBY. Furthermore, consideration of the fact that the KokchetavNorth Tianshan range was collaged to the southern margin of the CBY in the Ordovician-Devonian indicates that both ranges were amalgamated synchronously with the CBY constructing the Early-Middle Paleozoic architecture of western Altaids.

AB Numerous small mafic-intermediate intrusions are present in the Kalatongke area in the southern part of the Paleozoic Altai Orogenic Belt, NW China. Previous studies reveal that most of these intrusions were emplaced at similar to 287 Ma, broadly coeval with the eruption of alkaline flood basalts at <= 282 Ma in the Tarim Craton. The similar ages have led some researchers to believe that the Tarim flood basalts and the Kalatongke mafic-intermediate intrusions are related to the same mantle plume. New and existing geochronological and geochemical data for the mafic-intermediate intrusions in the Kalatongke area together do not support such interpretation. Most of the intrusions in this small area (4.5 x 2 km) were emplaced at similar to 287 Ma but our new data reveal that older intrusive rocks with zircon U-Pb ages from 290 +/- 1.5 to 320 +/- 2 Ma are also present. The temporal and spatial distribution of these intrusions does not show a hotspot track as expected by the mantle plume model. The intrusive rocks have similar Nd-Hf isotope compositions (epsilon Nd = 3-9, epsilon Hf = 15-19) and are all characterized by light REE enrichments relative to heavy REE, plus pronounced negative Nb-Ta anomalies. The oldest intrusion (similar to 320 Ma) also shows negative Zr-Hf anomalies, which are common in arc basalts but absent in continental flood basalts. The results of mixing calculations based on Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes and selected trace elements (Th, Nb and Yb) indicate that the parental magmas for these intrusions were all enriched in Th and depleted in Nb prior to crustal contamination, similar to the magmas generated in a convergent tectonic setting from subduction to post-subduction elsewhere in the world. The results from this study remind us that temporal correlation is not a reliable tool to determine the size of a mantle plume. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Comparing with the well-known classic Cahn-Hilliard equation, the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation is equipped with a nonlocal diffusion operator and can describe more practical phenomena for modeling phase transitions of microstructures in materials. On the other hand, it evidently brings more computational costs in numerical simulations, thus efficient and accurate time integration schemes are highly desired. In this paper, we propose two energy-stable linear semi-implicit methods with first and second order temporal accuracies respectively for solving the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation. The temporal discretization is done by using the stabilization technique with the nonlocal diffusion term treated implicitly, while the spatial discretization is carried out by the Fourier collocation method with FFT-based fast implementations. The energy stabilities are rigorously established for both methods in the fully discrete sense. Numerical experiments are conducted for a typical case involving Gaussian kernels. We test the temporal convergence rates of the proposed schemes and make a comparison of the nonlocal phase transition process with the corresponding local one. In addition, long-time simulations of the coarsening dynamics are also performed to predict the power law of the energy decay. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a doubly stochastic radial basis function (DSRBF) method for function recoveries. Instead of a constant, we treat the RBF shape parameters as stochastic variables whose distribution were determined by a stochastic leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) estimation. A careful operation count is provided in order to determine the ranges of all the parameters in our methods. The overhead cost for setting up the proposed DSRBF method is O(n(2)) for function recovery problems with nbasis. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed method not only outperforms constant shape parameter formulation (in terms of accuracy with comparable computational cost) but also the optimal LOOCV formulation (in terms of both accuracy and computational cost).

AB We simulate complex fluids by means of an on-the-fly coupling of the bulk rheology to the underlying microstructure dynamics. In particular, a continuum model of polymeric fluids is constructed without a pre-specified constitutive relation, but instead it is actively learned from mesoscopic simulations where the dynamics of polymer chains is explicitly computed. To couple the bulk rheology of polymeric fluids and the microscale dynamics of polymer chains, the continuum approach (based on the finite volume method) provides the transient flow field as inputs for the (mesoscopic) dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), and in turn DPD returns an effective constitutive relation to close the continuum equations. In this multiscale modeling procedure, we employ an active learning strategy based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to minimize the number of expensive DPD simulations, where adaptively selected DPD simulations are performed only as necessary. Numerical experiments are carried out for flow past a circular cylinder of a non-Newtonian fluid, modeled at the mesoscopic level by bead-spring chains. The results show that only five DPD simulations are required to achieve an effective closure of the continuum equations at Reynolds number Re = 10. Furthermore, when Re is increased to 100, only one additional DPD simulation is required for constructing an extended GPR-informed model closure. Compared to traditional message-passing multiscale approaches, applying an active learning scheme to multiscale modeling of non-Newtonian fluids can significantly increase the computational efficiency. Although the method demonstrated here obtains only a local viscosity from the polymer dynamics, it can be extended to other multiscale models of complex fluids whose macro-rheology is unknown.

AB The substitution of TiO2 with network modifiers (sodium, Na+ and calcium, Ca2+) within a bioactive glass series was investigated to synthesize amorphous scaffolds from the SiO2-CaO-Na2O-P2O5 glass system. Three glasses were formulated for this study, a control (BG) and two experimental formulations with 9 wt% TiO2 substituted for CaO (SC-1) and Na2O (SC-2) respectively. X-ray diffraction presented an amorphous pattern for BG and SC-I, with extensive crystallinity present in SC-2. Differential thermal analysis presented a higher T-g for SC-1 (559 degrees C) and SC-2 (627 degrees C) compared to BG (531 degrees C), however a greater distribution of Q-species was evident in SC-1 and SC-2, particularly in the Q(1)-Q(2) regions as evidenced by MAS-NMR. Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) testing presented calcium phosphate (CaP) deposition on BG however no visible CaP layer was observed on the surface of SC-1 and SC-2. Ion release profiles exhibited a much slower Si release rate with respect to time for SC-1 and SC-2, which may be the limiting factor when tested in SBF. The addition of TiO2 to the glass stabilized the pH during SBF testing and significantly increased the hardness compared to the control BG. Scaffold fabrication was conducted with SC-1, and a porous amorphous structure was synthesized at 635 degrees C.

AB The amorphous/crystalline (A/C) nanomultilayers have been aroused great interest in people due to its first-class mechanical properties. The effects of the thickness of crystalline and amorphous on the deformation mechanism of A/C CuZr/Cu nanomultilayers under tension loading here are investigated by molecular dynamics method. The results indicate that the mechanical behavior of nanomultilayer strongly depends on the bidirectional synergistic deformation mechanism between crystal phase and amorphous phase. The deformation behavior of nanomultilayers can be controlled by integrating the thickness of different phases to achieve high strength and superplastic multilayer materials. For the nanomultilayers with constant crystal layer, the plastic deformation changes from shear band propagation to a pronounced interface slip-accommodation mechanism, and ultimately to crack propagation mode with decreasing amorphous thickness. For the nanomultilayers with fixed amorphous layer thickness, the mechanical behavior changes from localization to plastic co-deformation mode with the crystalline thickness decreases. This study proposes an approach for achieving a good balance between strength and ductility, which is useful for the synthesis of A/C nanomultilayer with high strength and predominant ductility.

AB NdF3-doped borosilicate glasses were prepared using the high-temperature melt components of ingredients of NdF3 doped borosilicate glasses. Optical transmission spectra were collected in the range of 190-2500 nm to determine different optical parameters such as the direct and the indirect optical band gap, Urbach energy, refractive index and optical dielectric constant. The molar refraction, electronic polarizability, and the optical basicity results have been determined using the measured glass refractive indices. Judd-Ofelt calculations were used to predict the oscillator strength of an electronic dipole absorption transition. The order of the parameters Omega(2), Omega(4) and Omega(6) are Omega(2) < Omega(4) < Omega(6). They were found to decrease with the increase of Nd3+ concentration. In addition, decreasing the parameter Omega(6) indicates that the rigidity of glass samples increases with the increase of Nd-3+ ions. The increase in rigidity, is also confirmed by the increase of the elastic moduli calculated using Makishima and Mackenzie model. This study suggests that the increasing concentration of Nd3+ in the Nd-doped borosilicate glasses not only affect the optical parameters but also increases the glasses rigidity.

AB A fractional differential rheological model was proposed to describe the nanoindentation creep behavior of metallic glasses (MGs) at room temperature. The model had been proved to not only include the conventional rheological model, but can be used to obtain the empirical formula that has been commonly used to characterize nanoindentation creep behavior of MGs. The reversible and irreversible parts of time-dependent deformations of (La0.5Ce0.5)(65)Al10Co25 metallic glass were obtained through nanoindentation creep experiments, and the results were used to investigate the effects of the creep load P-max and the loading rate <(P) over dot> on the creep behavior and the variations of the model parameters. The results indicate that the fractional differential rheological model can describe the creep deformation quite well. Parameters analysis shows that viscoelastic part of creep and beta relaxation has many common points. The variation of irreversible viscoplastic part of creep with creep load is the main cause of indentation size effect. The load rate <(P) over dot> has effect on all components of creep deformation, which is reflected by the variations of the rheological model parameters. The viscosity and retardation time are related to the loading history as indicators that characterize the system's instantaneous viscosity at the onset of creep. The fractional order and creep stress exponent varies with loading rate have sim ilar pattern, which could reflect the flowing ability upon the completion of the creep experiment.

Five adjacent grains exhibiting twin relationships share the common < 1 1 0 > direction and demonstrate a fivefold symmetry axis. This special symmetry relationship gives a new light on twin grain nucleation. An abundant icosahedron in the melting is constituted of twenty regular tetrahedrons.

AB Selective laser melting (SLM) of Mg-Al powder mixture is a promising method to additively manufacture Mg-Al alloy components without using pre-alloyed powder as feedstock. However, the microstructure and consequent tensile properties of SLMed Mg-9 wt%Al powder mixture have not been systematically investigated. In this work, spherical Mg and Al powder with a weight ratio of 91:9 were mixed using ball milling and the mixture was SLMed at different processing parameters. Mg-Al alloy was successfully fabricated and the highest relative density achieved was 95.7%. The results of scanning electron microscopy showed that the microstructure and volume of defects could be controlled by tuning the processing parameters. The highest ultimate tensile strength achieved was 274 MPa, which was comparable to the strength of SLMed pre-alloyed Mg-9 wt%Al as reported in literature. Based on this study, SLM of different Mg powder mixture can be investigated in future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Annealing treatment plays a vital role in tuning the microstructure and improving the performance of the thermoelectric film. In this work, SnTe thin films were fabricated by thermal evaporation technique and then annealed at a series of temperatures. The effects of annealing temperature on the element composite, surface morphology, crystal structure and thermoelectric properties were investigated. The electrical conductivity of the annealed films was increased while the Seebeck coefficient was declined slightly, due to the largely enhanced carrier concentrations and slightly reduced carrier mobility. In specific, the maximum Seebeck coefficient of 155 mu V K-1 and power factor of 29 mu W cm(-1) K-2 were achieved at the annealing temperature of 400 degrees C. Our results may provide an effective strategy to improve the properties of thermoelectric films. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Covalent-bond-link benzo[ghi]perylenetriimide/graphitic carbon nitride (BPTI/g-C3N4) was synthesized by N-amidation reaction of benzo[ghi]perylene diimide tris-anhydride (BPDI) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). BPTI/g-C3N4 composite possesses more compact p-n heterojunction with high electron-hole separation rate and loose structure because of the alkyl chains and unilateral active groups of BPDI. The composite was characterized with different methods, including FT-IR, XPS, XRD, SEM and TG which illustrated the content of BPTI in composite attain to 5.6%. The photocatalytic experiments on the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) indicated that the photocatalytic activity of BPTI/g-C3N4 performed 3 times as well as that of pure g-C3N4.

ID ORGANIC-DYE; ELECTRODES; EFFICIENCY
AB In this work, doping manganese into quantum dots is proved as an effective method to suppress charge recombination and improve photovoltaic performance in the doped quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). The results demonstrate more quantity photons are utilized by quantum dots in the broader absorption range. The doped QDSSCs shows the suppressed charge recombination, extended electron lifetime and increased electron injection efficiency for solar cells with Mn dopant by current-voltage measurement and others characteristics methods. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of Mn-CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSCs exhibits 7.16%, which is clearly higher than 5.54% for QDSSCs without Mn dopant. The enhancement is ascribed to an intermediate energy level of Mn-CdS, which improves light harvest and accelerates the charge separation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-efficiency hydrogen evolution is obtained from a novel fluorescein homogeneous system, comprising a noble metal free fluorescein as the photosensitizer, Pt nanoparticle as the cocatalyst and TEOA as the holes scavenger in an aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The highest H-2 production rate is 491.40 mu mol/h (lambda > 420 nm) and quantum efficiencies of our system are among the highest reported for the molecular hydrogen systems in the visible light range. Unlike many reported molecular hydrogen systems are either unstable under illumination and expensive, or have weak photocatalytic performances, our low-cost system exhibits excellent activity and endurance. We believe that this low-cost, high-efficiency and durable homogeneous system for molecular hydrogen may result in new breakthroughs for the hydrogen energy and solar energy utilization.

AB A new type of hierarchically nonspherical architecture with sandwich-structured multilayer nanosheets has been successfully prepared via a controllable multistep approach in case of SnO2/Fe2O3 heterostructures. The morphological characterization reveals that unique sandwich-structured SnO2/Fe2O3 multilayer nanosheets (MNSs) are constructed via the self-assembly of densely well-aligned Fe2O3 nanorod layers to cover and fill the interlayers of hexagonal SnO2 hollow multilayer nanosheets (HMNs). When used as the sensing materials for acetone detection, the sandwich hetero-nanostructures demonstrate evidently improved sensing performance compared to pure SnO2. The significantly improved sensing performance can be attributed not only to the rational microstructures for fast transfer of gas molecules, but also to the additional effects of loaded Fe2O3 ultrathin nanorods.

The electrochemical performance show that the HPCM/S composite as cathode delivered a reversible capacity over 617 mA h g(-1) at 0.7C, maintaining over 311 mA h g(-1) capacities after 60 cycles. The good electrochemical properties can be attributed to the hollow and porous structure of HPCM, which can host sulfur efficiently and alleviate the volume expansion caused by polysulfide.

As-fabricated PAN/PANI blend nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for the confirmation of fibers with nanoscale and blends of PAN and PANI. The semiconducting behavior of the PAN/PANI blend nanofibers was found to respond quickly towards ammonia gas. Sensitivity of the blend was obtained at near room temperature for different concentrations of ammonia. Bessel's polynomial function was found to be well fitted with the experimental data for the response towards ammonia gas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of present study was to investigate the biological properties of prepared scaffolds. Both in vitro as well as in vivo methods were used for these studies. The in vitro study were performed using mouse fibroblasts cells line NIH 3T3 and in vivo by subdermal and peritoneal cavity implantation in rats for up 30 days. The results of in vitro cytotoxity tests indicated that the samples were well tolerated by the cells. Good biocompatibility is demonstrated by the absence of necrosis or abscess formation in the surrounding tissues. This study provides valuable insight, which may lead to new applications of collagen/hydroxyapatite matrices in the field of tissue engineering. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ca3Co4O9 (C349) nanofibres were obtained by Solution Blow Spinning (SBS) and evaluated as electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions (ORR and OER). Calcined nanofibres were characterised in terms of structural, morphological and electrochemical features. Results showed that catalytic activity of C349 nanofibres for ORR/OER is in line with literature data for carbon-related materials. The areal capacitance is much better than that of TiO2 nanotubes.

AB Stress relaxation tests were carried out to identify stress relaxation limit of Inconel718 under different testing conditions. Experimental results indicated that stress relaxation limits calculated by function-fitting were consistent with testing data at service temperatures and low initial stress because of the rapid reaching of steady state. However, there exist large deviations using the same method under testing conditions of over-temperatures or high initial stress (near yield stress). Reasons for these are related to stress relaxation mechanism which can be illustrated by microstructure evolution: diffusion motion accelerates remarkably at high temperature, while multiple forms of plastic deformation occurs at high initial stress.

ID ENHANCED MICROWAVE-ABSORPTION; IRON
AB Massive efforts have been focused on effective electromagnetic absorbing materials, which have promising applications in suppressing or eliminating the electromagnetic radiation. In this study, Fe3O4@SiO2@PPy composites were prepared via a facile one-pot polyreaction. The results demonstrate that the composites loaded with 30 wt% possess an excellent electromagnetic absorbing property. Specifically, the minimum reflection loss value is -56.90 dB at 10.41 GHz at an absorber thickness of 3.7 mm. The broadest effective frequency bandwidth (reflection loss less than -10 dB) is 6.38 GHz at an absorber thickness of 3 mm. The outstanding performance implies that the Fe3O4@SiO2@PPy composites have a huge potential for application as advanced electromagnetic absorber with the advantages of strong absorption, wide bandwidth and low density.

The self-assembly of EA with Mn ion results in a stable micro-sized ellagic acid-Mn (EAMn) particle with the features of green and low cost. Direct carbonization of the EAMn assembly leads to the formation of MnOx-Carbon (MnOx-C) nanocomposite with a mixed manganese oxide crystal structure and a relative high surface area.

AB The influence of reused times on the characteristics and properties of Ti6Al4V (TC4) powder and resulting bulk materials were systematically investigated in additive manufacturing by electron beam melting (EBM). Optical microscope, X-ray diffraction and nano-indentation were used to characterize the powders. Optical microscope results indicated that the microstructure evolved from non-equilibrium to equilibrium state of alpha and beta phase with increasing reuse times. The micro-hardness and Young's modulus of reused powders were enhanced with the increase of reuse times. The tensile properties of bulk final product fabricated from the mixed powders were nearly equal or superior to that prepared by 100% fresh powder. In short, the mixing usage of initial and reused Ti6Al4V powders for additive manufacturing is acceptable. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CONTINUOUS STIFFNESS MEASUREMENT; BEHAVIOR
AB The viscoelastic properties of polymer blends of poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) and poly(butylene succinate-dilinoleate) (PBS-DLA) copolymer intended for cardiac tissue patches are investigated by dynamic flat punch nanoindentation at frequencies ranging from 1 to 45 Hz. The storage modulus is found to depend weakly on the testing frequency, the lowest value being for 1 Hz, which corresponds to the usual heart rate. More significantly, it is found that varying the PGS content between 40 and 70 wt% allows tuning the storage modulus of the blends between 11 and 39 MPa. The reliability of the nanoindentation method is validated by reference dynamic mechanical measurements on thicker PBS-DLA samples using a tensile testing machine. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study we report the preparation and properties of KOH doped para-polybenzimidazole membrane as anion conducting polymer electrolyte for application in water electrolysis cell. The membrane demonstrated an outstanding OH- conductivity measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which depending on the relative humidity varies in the range 298-1140 mS.cm(-1). The membrane electrode assembly prepared with this membrane and a novel non-carbon supported Pt catalyst were tested in a single electrolysis cell at close to real operation conditions both at room and at 80 degrees C. The results obtained showed low overpotentials concerning both partial reactions and a stable electrochemical performance at cell voltage of 2.2 V. The enhanced efficiency of the electrolysis has been attributed to the combined effects of the high membrane conductivity, the homogeneous distribution and small size of the catalytic particles, and the corrosion resistance of the selected catalyst support.

AB Here, we report a new method to conjugate nanoparticles with live cells with high efficiency and biocompatibility. Distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG polymers was first gifted with cyclodextrin and then anchored on the surface of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Then azobenzene derivative (Azo)-modified upconversion nanoparticles were conjugated to cells to construct live cells-based nanoparticle delivery system by host-guest interactions between cyclodextrin and Azo. Owing to free of chemical reactions of the DSPE-anchoring and host-guest interactions process, the conjugating strategy is very biocompatible. In vitro study illustrated that the differentiation potential of stem cells was not affected after anchoring nanoparticles indicating a biocompatible conjugating method for the construction of cell patch.

In this work, a strategy is presented for the preparation by spin coating and at low temperature of well-crystallized, well-covering thin films with a AgBi2I7 global composition. The films are shown of high structural quality and the layer morphology has been controlled to produce either smooth or rough layers of similar thickness. We show that controlling the layer morphology and its interface with a hole transporting layer (Spiro-OMeTAD) plays an important role for the charge extraction and then the performances of devices. These films have been optimized and yielded perovskite-like solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.83%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Experimental data from a 17.5% efficient perovskite solar cell has been used to develop a self-consistent device model using Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS). Electronic properties of the individual layers, such as doping density of compact TiO2 (c-TiO2), doping and defect density of perovskite, etc. are extracted from experimental data. The only fitting parameters in the model are the defect densities at spiro-MeOTAD/perovskite interface (IL-1) and perovskite/TiO2 interface (IL-2). The simulated current-voltage (J-V) characteristics and Mott-Schottky plot results match extremely well with the experimentally measured plots, validating the device model. The model was further used to extract insights into the loss mechanism of the high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. Simulations revealed that defect density at IL-1 interface has strong impact on the open-circuit voltage (V-OC), while defect density in the perovskite and IL2 interface has a major impact on short-circuit current density (J(SC)).

AB In this paper, novel transparent nano-pattern window screen was successfully prepared by electrospinning. SEM, VHX 3D digital microscope and tensile tester were employed to characterize the morphology and the mechanical properties, which indicated that the nanofibers in the PA66 nano-patterned membranes are uniform and the diameter of about 200 nm, and there is no adhesion between nanofibers. In addition, we could find that the surface of the PA66 transparent nano-patterned membrane was more flat. Simultaneously, Mechanical properties of the PA66 nano-pattern membrane are better than those of the PA66 random orientation membrane. Moreover, applications of the PA66 transparent nano-pattern window screen as a filter for air filtration, we could find that the window screen showed excellent filtration efficiency for the PM0.3-5.

AB Copper oxide (CuO) loaded titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotube photocatalyst was synthesised using the facile hydrothermal method. The synthesised photocatalyst were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study their physiochemical properties. The photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts was tested for carbon dioxide (CO2) photoconversion into fuels. CuO loaded TiO2 nanotube demonstrated higher CO2 conversion (100%) than TiO2 nanotube (72.20%) because of the former's effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the presence of CuO.

The hydrogen evolution rate of CFT-Pt0.9 is 4698 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) under simulated sunlight irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of CFT-Pt-0.9 is higher than pure CFT, P25-Pt-0.9 and HT-Pt-0.9. The higher photocatalytic efficiency of CFT-Pt-0.9 may attribute to higher charge separation efficiency and charge transfer rate, which are caused by Schottky junction interface and large interface area.

AB A systematic investigation is performed to determine the effects of the concentration of silver on metal assisted chemical etching (MaCE) for nanostructure formation mechanisms on silicon as well as their resultant optical properties. Silver nitrate concentrations of 8 mM, 4 mM, 3 mM and 2 mM with hydrogen fluoride were used for the preparation of p-type silicon nanostructures. Experimentally, it is observed that when the catalysis molarity concentration is decreased in the etching processes, it resulted in nanostructures ranging from 140 to 60 nm, respectively over the concentrations investigated. A detailed analysis of the optical properties and structure provided insight into the physics of their formation. In addition, the results show the silicon nanostructures formed black silicon where in the visible region of the spectrum the reflectance dropped by an order of magnitude. The results indicate MaCE is a promising approach to the manufacturing of antireflection coatings on black silicon-based solar photovoltaic cells. MaCE is a simple and scalable approach to enhance the optical absorption of silicon and improve the overall efficiency of the solar cell without adding significantly to the complexity, capital expenditure or cost of production.

AB A Zn-salen based covalent triazine framework (Zn@CTF) was prepared through ZnCl2 promoted one-pot procedure under ionothermal conditions using salen type precursor N,N'-Bis(5-cyano-salicylidene)-1,2-benzendiamine derived from imine condensation reaction of 3-formyl-4-hydroxybenzonitrile and 1,2-diaminebenzene. The chemical structure of the obtained polymer was characterized by solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and element analysis. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the prepared polymer possessed amorphous structure and good thermal stability. The porous property of the polymer material was also characterized by N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and the Zn@CTF material exhibited excellent porosity with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of up to 598.2 m(2) g(-1). The surface microstructure property was evaculated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CO2 adsorption performance of the Zn@CTF was further investigated and it was found that the CO2 uptake capacity was 43.9 cm(3) g(-1) at 273 K. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB [0001]-oriented alumina ceramics with texture fractions (F-0001) ranging from similar to 9.6% to 93.6% were pre-pared by templated grain growth (TGG) of nanoscale matrix. Ceramic density directly controls F-0001. Impingement of textured grains can be observed at F-0001 >= 58.4%. When fracturing samples along [0001], the interfaces between basal surfaces of the impinged textured grains provide a favorable path for crack deflection, and the deflection distance becomes longer with increasing F-0001. As a result of both crack defection and high density, optimum fracture toughness similar to 4.6 MPa.m(1/2) and flexural strength similar to 589 MPa were achieved at F-0001 = 93.6%, which are much higher than those obtained in the randomly oriented counterpart. This work can provide guidelines for the design and synthesis of novel structural ceramics with improved performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The designed Cr2O3-ZnO hierarchical heterostructures have been successfully synthesized by a facile two-step route. The SEM, TEM, XRD and EDS mapping characterizations demonstrate that Cr2O3 nanoparticles are well decorated on surfaces of nanosheet-assembled flowerlike ZnO, constructing three dimensional Cr2O3-ZnO hierarchical heterostructures. Such hierarchical architectures are developed and applied in formaldehyde (HCHO) gas detection. The gas sensing results indicate that Cr2O3-ZnO heterostructures based sensors exhibit superior HCHO gas sensing properties with rapid response/recovery behavior (1 s/5 s) toward 100 ppm formaldehyde (HCHO) gas, and favorable stability and repeatability with the on/off phenomenon when switching between HCHO and air at a optimal working temperature of 220 degrees C. The superior formaldehyde gas sensing performances are predominantly attributed to the appropriate sensitization effect induced by Cr2O3 nanoparticles and the special three dimensional hierarchical architectures.

The molecular structure of the polyoxoanion does not change after loading on the nickel foam. Benefiting from the high specific surface area and high electronic conductivity of nickel foam, this material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction with low overpotential (550 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), a Tafel slope of 172 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability in sodium phosphate buffer (200 mM, pH 6). Our finding introduces a new way for developing the polyoxometalate-based electrocatalysts for water oxidation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The resulting films were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Their third-order nonlinear optical properties and photo-excitation dynamics were investigated with 20 ps laser pulses at 532 nm. The results demonstrate that the ultrathin films have notable third order optical nonlinearities (chi((3))similar to 4.7 x 10(-9) (esu)) and fast excited-state relaxation (tau similar to 67 +/- 6 ps), indicating their potential applications in future nonlinear optical devices.

AB The present work reports about the low-cost inorganic nickel sulphide-carbon composite synthesized using the simple chemical method and to be used as hybrid hole extraction and as a counter electrode material for perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3)-based solar cells (PSCs). The structural analysis confirms the existence of nickel sulphide (NiS) crystalline phase composed of small-sized crystallites. The optimal bandgap values of the prepared perovskite (1.51 eV) and NiS (3.71 eV) materials found to be favorable in achieving the active absorbing and hole extraction properties in PSCs. The surface morphology of the nickel sulphide materials is found to be highly dependent on the NiS-carbon composition. The current density-voltage (J-V) results of the fabricated perovskite solar cells with nickel sulphide-carbon composite hole transporting layer (HTL) suggests that incorporation of commercial carbon paste into the nickel sulphide nanoparticles tends to promote the charge carrier transporting ability and resulted in yielding high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.20%, when compared to that of the bare NiS (1.87%). The results show that this nickel sulphide-carbon composite can serve as an efficient dual role as an HTL to transport holes and as a conductive counter electrode for the planar heterojunction PSCs with the structure FTO/compact-TiO2/porous-TiO2/perovskite/NiS-carbon. So, nickel sulphide-carbon composite can be considered as an efficient replacement for the other unstable HTMs and high-cost metal counter electrodes used in PSCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

During the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER), FeP/CdS exhibited excellent catalytic activity under visible light with lactic acid as sacrificial reagent. The H-2 evolution rate of 3% FeP/CdS was 21.6 mmol/g/h, which is almost four folders higher than that of Pt/CdS.

AB The crystal structure of (1-x)KNbO3-xBiFeO(3) (KNBF) and (1-x)KNbO3-LaFeO3 (KNLF) (where x = 0.00; 0.01; 0.02; 0.04; 0.08; 0.16; 0.32) was evaluated by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. XRD data show the crystal symmetry to evolve from orthorhombic to tetragonal with increasing x. The optical bandgap was found to narrow systematically with increasing x. Raman spectroscopy analysis corroborated long-range polar order in all compositions. The photoresponse of x = 0.32 shows a typical diode-like behaviour, with current and voltage of 0.115 mu A and 0.075 V for KNBF and 0.19 mu A and 0.035 V for KNLF, respectively. To our knowledge these represent the largest values among KNbO3-based ceramics, making them promising for photovoltaic applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nodularin, one of the toxins produced by cyanobacteria commonly occurring in brackish waters, is a cyclic pentapeptide, that may exert adverse effects on animal and human health. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of nodularin on different fish cellular models. The leukocytes isolated from carp head kidney and common carp (Cyprinus carpio L) leukocyte cell line (CLC) were incubated with the cyanotoxin at the concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05 or 0.1 g/mL. Treatment of cells with the higher concentrations of the toxin resulted in a dramatic decrease in cell viability. Simultaneously, we observed an increase in the percentage of necrotic cells. Nodularin also induced apoptosis as demonstrated by increased caspase-3/7 activity, and DNA fragmentation. We found, that primary cell cultures were more sensitive to the toxin than CLC cells. Our study also demonstrated significant increases in intracellular ROS production and decreases in GSH levels, observed in both primary leukocytes and CLC cells exposed to nodularin at 0.01-0.1 mu g/mL. These cells exhibited similar GSH/GSSG ratios and similar level of oxidized glutathione. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Toxin genes in animals undergo accelerated evolution compared to non-toxin genes to be effective and competitive in prey capture, as well as to enhance their predator defense. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this unusual phenomenon. These include (a) frequent mutations in exons compared to introns and nonsynonymous substitutions in exons; (b) high frequency of point mutations are due to the presence of more unstable triplets in exons compared to introns; (c) Accelerated Segment Switch in Exons to alter Targeting (ASSET); (d) Rapid Accumulation of Variations in Exposed Residues (RAVERS); (e) alteration in intron-exon boundary; (f) deletion of exon; and (g) loss/gain of domains through recombination. By systematic analyses of snake venom disintegrin/metalloprotease genes, I describe a new mechanism in the evolution of these genes through exonization and intronization. In the evolution of RTS/KTS disintegrins, a new exon (10a) is formed in intron 10 of the disintegrin/metalloprotease gene. Unlike more than 90% new exons that are from repetitive elements in introns, exon 10a originated from a non-repetitive element. To incorporate exon 10a, part of the exon 11 is intronized to retain the open reading frame. This is the first case of simultaneous exonization and intronization within a single gene. This new mechanism alters the function of toxins through drastic changes to the molecular surface via insertion of new exons and deletion of exons. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bee venom is a very complex mixture of natural products extracted from honey bee which contains various pharmaceutical properties such as peptides, enzymes, biologically active amines and nonpeptide components. The use of bee venom into the specific points is so called bee venom therapy, which is widely used as a complementary and alternative therapy for 3000 years. A growing number of evidence has demonstrated the anti-inflammation, the anti-apoptosis, the anti-fibrosis and the antiarthrosclerosis effects of bee venom therapy. With these pharmaceutical characteristics, bee venom therapy has also been used as the therapeutic method in treating rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, liver fibrosis, atherosclerosis, pain and others. Although widely used, several cases still reported that bee venom therapy might cause some adverse effects, such as local itching or swelling. In this review, we summarize its potential mechanisms, therapeutic applications, and discuss its existing problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vespa tropica, a social wasp locally found in Thailand is responsible for many out off the record accidental stings due to close encounters with human activities and because of the animal's highly potent venom. Phospholipase (PLA) is one of the major proteins commonly found in insect venom. In this work, V tropica phospholipase was successfully isolated, purified and characterized. Three isoforms PLAs have been purified using reversed phase HPLC, and are named VesT1 s (VesT1.01a, VesT1.01b and VesT1.02). They are not glycoproteins. VesT1.01s has a molecular weight of 33.72 kDa while for VesT1.02 a mass of 34 kDa was found.
   The deduced sequence of the mature VesT1.02 protein is composed of 301 amino acid residues (1005 bp), including the catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp), which is similar to other wasp venom PLAs. The 12 cysteine residues found are conserved among venom PLA1. They form six disulfide bonds, and therefore have no free sulffiydryl groups. Based on homology modelling, VesT1.02 belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. Its structure is composed of 10 beta-sheets and 11 alpha-helixes, characterized by a beta-strandieSerla-helix structural motif, which contains the Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly consensus sequence. The shortened lid and shortened 139 loop, which play important roles in substrate selectivity, cause this enzyme to only exhibit PLA activity. Moreover, these PLAs have been shown to be highly thermally stable after heating at 100 degrees C for 5 min. We propose that an inserted Pro residue might be involved in this high thermo-stability.

AB The differences of tetrodotoxin (TTX) levels in various parts of pufferfish (Torquigener flavimaculosus) were examined in conjunction with the seasonal and sexual variations. The TTX levels in gonads, liver, intestines, skin and muscle tissue were determined using the Q-TOF LC/MS. Instrumental analysis revealed that all examined tissues from T flavimaculosus contained high TTX concentrations. TTX levels in the gonads, liver, intestines, skin and muscle tissue of pufferfish were within the range of 5.03-100.71, 7.04-106.80, 12.59-86.30, 33.95-139.88 and 15.88-86.07 (mu/g), respectively. It was determined that in all seasons, except for summer, female individuals had higher TTX levels than males. Among all seasons, the highest level of TTX was found in winter and the lowest in autumn. Consequently, T. flavimaculosus is a highly toxic pufferfish that is dangerous for human consumption and should not be consumed under any circumstances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Snakebite envenoming represents a major issue in rural areas of tropical and subtropical regions across sub-Saharan Africa, South to Southeast Asia, Latin America and Oceania. Antivenoms constitute the only scientifically validated therapy for snakebite envenomings, provided they are safe, effective, affordable, accessible and administered appropriately. However, the lack of financial incentives in a technology that has remained relatively unchanged for more than a century, has contributed to some manufacturers leaving the market and others downscaling production or increasing the prices, leading to a decline in the availability and accessibility for these life-saving antidotes to millions of rural poor most at risk from snakebites in low income countries. The shortage of antivenoms can be significantly alleviated by optimizing the use of current antivenoms (through the assessment of their specific and paraspecific efficacy against the different medically relevant homologous and heterologous snake venoms) and by generating novel polyspecific antivenoms exhibiting broad clinical spectrum and wide geographic distribution range. Research on venoms has been continuously enhanced by advances in technology. Particularly, the last decade has witnessed the development of omics strategies for unravelling the toxin composition of venoms ("venomics") and to assess the immunorecognition profile of antivenoms ("antivenomics"). Here, we review recent developments and reflect on near future innovations that promise to revolutionize the mutually enlightening relationship between evolutionary and translational venomics.

AB Aphanizomenon gracile is one of the most widespread Paralytic Shellfish Toxin (PST) producing cyanobacteria in freshwater bodies in the Northern Hemisphere. It has been shown to produce various PST congeners, including saxitoxin (STX), neosaxitoxin (NEO), decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and gonyautoxin 5 (GTX5) in Europe, North America and Asia. Three cyanobacteria strains were isolated in Lake Iznik in northwestern Turkey. Morphological characterization of these strains suggested all three strains conformed to classical taxonomic identification of A. gracile with some differences such as clumping of filaments, partially hyaline cells in some filaments and longer than usual vegetative cells. Sequences of 16S rRNA gene of these strains were placed within an A. gracile cluster including the majority of PST producing strains, confirming the identification of these strains as A. gracile. These new strains possessed saxitoxin biosynthesis genes sxtA, sxtG and their sequences clustered with those of other A. gracile. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis demonstrated the presence of NEO, STX, dcSTX and decarbamoylneosaxitoxin (dcNEO) in all strains. This is the first report of a PST producer in any water body in Turkey and first observation of dcNEO in an A. gracile culture. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Among venomous animals, Hymenoptera have been suggested as a rich source of natural toxins. Due to their broad ecological diversity, venom from Hymenoptera insects (bees, wasps and ants) have evolved differentially thus widening the types and biological functions of their components. To date, insect toxinology analysis have scarcely uncovered the complex composition of bee, wasp and ant venoms which include low molecular weight compounds, highly abundant peptides and proteins, including several allergens. In Hymenoptera, these complex mixtures of toxins represent a potent arsenal of biological weapons that are used for self-defense, to repel intruders and to capture prey. Consequently, Hymenoptera venom components have a broad range of pharmacological targets and have been extensively studied, as promising sources of new drugs and biopesticides. In addition, the identification and molecular characterization of Hymenoptera venom allergens have allowed for the rational design of component-resolved diagnosis of allergy, finally improving the outcome of venom immunotherapy (VIT). Until recently, a limited number of Hymenoptera venoms had been unveiled due to the technical limitations of the approaches used to date. Nevertheless, the application of novel techniques with high dynamic range has significantly increased the number of identified peptidic and proteinaceous toxins. Considering this, the present review summarizes the current knowledge about the most representative Hymenoptera venom peptides and proteins which are under study for a better understanding of the insect-caused envenoming process and the development of new drugs and biopesticides.

AB Objectives: To quantify (by qPCR) the density of Demodex canis mites in the skin of dogs with demodicosis and in healthy dogs, as well as measuring the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and tumour necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-alpha).
   Methods: Fifty-four dogs were divided into three groups: localized demodicosis (LD, n = 16), generalized demodicosis (GD, n = 22), and control group (CG, n = 16). All dogs were subjected to skin scraping, blood collection, and skin biopsy. DNA extraction was performed and the parasite density was established by qPCR. Serum cytokine concentrations were obtained by flow cytometry.
   Results: The median number of mites in the skin of the GD (6.2 x 10(4) copies/mu L) and LD dogs (1.2 x 10(4) copies/mu L) was statistically higher than that in the CG dogs (8.7 x 10(2) copies/mu L). Whereas there were no significant differences in median IL-1 beta, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha levels among the study groups, there was a statistically higher IL-6 concentration in the LD dogs than in the healthy dogs.
   Conclusions: According to our results, qPCR is an effective method for measuring the density of D. canis in the canine integument. In addition, the activation of the acute-phase immune response in localized demodicosis can be induced by IL-6 activity.

AB Scabies is an allergic skin disease that affects millions of mammals worldwide, including humans. It is a neglected tropical disease that represents a significant public health threat, particularly in economically disadvantaged populations. An effective vaccine is not currently available, and the exact mode of pathogenesis remains unclear. Herein, we identified, cloned and recombinantly expressed triosephosphate isomerase from Sarcoptes scabiei (S. scabiei). Immunohistochemical analyses showed that S. scabiei triosephosphate isomerase (Ss-TIM) is localized in the legs and chewing mouthparts of mites, and in infected rabbit skin (keratinized skin and embedded mites). Intradermal skin tests of rabbits injected with recombinant S. scabiei triosephosphate isomerase (rSs-TIM) revealed a flare, erythema and wheal reaction. These findings suggest that Ss-TIM may contribute to host invasion and induce an allergic response in the host.

AB Thin film composite (TFC) membranes are the gold standard for the application of forward osmosis (FO) in seawater desalination and wastewater treatment. However, bidirectional mass transport phenomena in this process still hinder its wider application. A deeper understanding of ion transport behavior in various solution conditions is critical for the fabrication of FO membrane and future development of FO process. In this work, we systematically investigated the influences of solution chemistry on ion mass transport in TFC FO membranes. Our results suggested that the mass transports of cations were much larger than those of anions in FO processes, and monovalent cations with smaller hydrated radius could induce greater cation exchange than divalent cations. Though anions did not participate in the cation exchange processes directly, cations paired with nitrate could transport through the TFC membrane more readily than those paired with chloride or sulfate. Additionally, a set of experiments with series solution concentrations confirmed the existence of cation transport bottleneck for one TFC FO membrane. We found that the cation transport capacity of TFC membranes was mainly determined by the concentration of feed solution and the generation of cation exchange behavior was independent of water transport Engineering implications of our findings for FO application were also discussed.

AB The widespread use of commercial silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) inevitably results in their increased release into natural waters and subsequent deposition in sediments, requiring the environmental impact of such deposition to be closely investigated. Hence, the effects of Ag NPs, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-Ag NPs, and sliver sulfide nanoparticles (Ag2S NPs) on denitrification-induced gas production (N2O and N-15-N-2), and denitrifying microbes in freshwater sediments were investigated. Slurry experiments (8 h) combined with a (NO3-)-N-15 addition technique were performed to determine the gaseous production. The abundance of relative functional genes (nirK, nirS and nosZ) and the composition of functional community were determined through RT-PCR and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. The obtained results showed that the toxicity of NPs on denitrification depended on their type (Ag+ > Ag NPs > PVP-Ag NPs > Ag2S NPs) and concentration, e.g., all 1 mg/L NPs exhibited no effects on denitrification, whereas evident hormesis effect-induced acceleration was observed in the case of Ag+. Conversely, 10 mg/L Ag+ and Ag NPs significantly inhibited the release rates of N2O and N-2 by decreasing the abundance of functional genes (nirK and/or nirS) and the predominant bacteria Paracoccus. PVP-Ag and Ag2S NPs had no effects on N-2 release rates and the composition of denitrifiers, however, inhibited the emission of N2O (by reducing the abundance of nirK), suggesting that normal denitrification-induced N-2 formation in sediments could still be sustained when the N2O production decrease lied within a certain range. Further, the inhibiting ability of Ag-containing NPs was caused by their intrinsic nanotoxicity to functional microbes rather than by the general toxicity of Ag+. Besides, Ag2S NPs (as a main detoxification form of AgNPs) were revealed to be intrinsically nanotoxic to denitrifiers, albeit showing the lowest inhibitory effect among the three tested NPs. Thus, this study demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of Ag-containing NPs on denitrification in sediments depends on their morphology and type, implying that the stability and toxicity of Ag-containing NPs should be considered with caution.

AB In this study we reported that the presence of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (FCNT-H) would greatly enhance the degradation of atrazine (ATZ), a model contaminant, in the Fe(III)-mediated Fenton-like system. Efficient ATZ degradation (>90%) was achieved within 30 min in the presence of 20 mg.L-1 FCNT-H, 2.0 mg.L-1 Fe(III), and 170 mg.L-1 H2O2, whereas negligible ATZ degradation occurred in FCNT-H free system. The structure and surface chemistry of FCNT-H and other CNTs were well characterized. The formed active species were determined based on ESR analysis, and the mass balance of Fe species during the reaction was monitored. In particular, a new method based on ferrozine complexation was proposed to track the formed Fe(II). The results indicated that ATZ was mainly degraded by the generated hydroxyl radical (HO center dot), and Fe(Ill)/Fe(II) cycling was still the rate-limiting step. Besides a small fraction of Fe(III) reduced by FCNT-H, a new pathway was revealed for fast reduction of most Fe(III), i.e., reaction of FCNT-H-Fe(III) complexes with H2O2. Comparison of different CNTs-mediated Fe(III)/H2O2 systems indicated that such enhanced effect of CNTs mainly resulted from the surface carboxyl group instead of hydroxyl and carbonyl group. Combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the electron density migration from Fe(III) to FCNT-H possibly resulted in the fast reduction of FCNT-H-Fe(III) complexes by H2O2. This study enables better understanding the enhanced Fe(III)-mediated Fenton-like reaction in the presence of MWCNTs and thus, will shed new light on how to develop more efficient similar Fenton systems via Fe(III) complexation.

AB Sources, occurrence, composition and dynamics of antifouling paint particles (APPs) were assessed in Patos lagoon estuary (PLE), Southern Brazil. Ten areas including boatyards, a marina and artisanal fishing harbors were identified in the estuarine system as potential sources of APPs. The APPs generated in these areas were highly heterogeneous considering the size, shape and composition. Based on an estimate of antifouling paint usage and amount of boats in each studied area, artisanal fishing harbors could be the main source of particles to PLE. However, relatively high amounts of APPs, which ranged from 130 to 40,300 mu g g(-1), were detected in sediments collected in front of boatyards and a marina. The uneven distribution of APPs levels among the sediment samples were probably due to the presence of diffuse sources (fishing harbors) associated to "hotspots" (boatyards and marina) along the study area. Additionally, data of settling experiment indicate that size, shape and density of APPs, combined to local hydrodynamics, appears to contribute to the mobility of these residues within the estuary. In the main channel of PLE, smaller particles tend to be transported to adjacent coastal zone while particles tend to be deposited in the sediment surface of sheltered areas. Since different trace metals, and booster biocides were detected in APPs that were not correctly disposed, these particles can be considered as an important source of contamination to aquatic environments. The present data suggest that APPs represent an environmental problem for aquatic systems in Brazil, since the country lacks legislation in addition to inefficient control mechanisms. An improvement in boat maintenance processes are urgently needed to avoid this continuous release of APPs into the aquatic systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The coagulation/flocculation/flotation (C/F/F) process is becoming a popular method for algae-laden water treatment. However, the efficiency of flotation is highly dependent on the ability of the preceding coagulation/flocculation process to form flocculated algae flocs. This study aims to improve the Microcystis aeruginosa flotation efficiency from algae cell and organic matter aspects by applying Fe(II)-regulated pretreatment enhanced Al coagulation process. The ability of the C/F/F process to remove cyanobacterial cells can be enhanced from 8% to 99% at a Fe(II) dose of 30 mu M. The Al dose needed can be reduced by more than half while achieving successful flotation. The introduced Fe(II) after KMnO4 can not only realize moderate pre-oxidation of cyanobacterial cells, but also form in-situ Fe(III). The DOC value can also be decreased significantly due to the formation of in-situ Fe(III), which is more efficient in dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal compared with pre-formed Fe(III). In addition, the gradually hydrolyzed in-situ Fe(III) can facilitate the hydrolysis of Al as a dual-coagulant and promote the clustering and cross-linking of Al hydrolyzates, which can enhance the formation of size-controlled algae flocs. Finally, the size-controlled algae flocs can be effectively floated by the bubbles released in the flotation process due to the efficient collision and attachment between flocs and bubbles. Therefore, the efficient flotation of algae cell and organic matter can be realized by the Fe(II) regulated moderate pre-oxidation of M. aeruginosa and formation of size-controlled algae flocs.

AB Many studies have quantified pharmaceuticals in the environment, few however, have incorporated detailed temporal and spatial variability due to associated costs in terms of time and materials. Here, we target 33 physico-chemically diverse pharmaceuticals in a spatiotemporal exposure study into the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater system and the Rivers Ouse and Foss (two diverse river systems) in the city of York, UK. Removal rates in two of the WWTPs sampled (a conventional activated sludge (CAS) and trickling filter plant) ranged from not eliminated (carbamazepine) to >99% (paracetamol). Data comparisons indicate that pharmaceutical exposures in river systems are highly variable regionally, in part due to variability in prescribing practices, hydrology, wastewater management, and urbanisation and that select annual median pharmaceutical concentrations observed in this study were higher than those previously observed in the European Union and Asia thus far. Significant spatial variability was found between all sites in both river systems, while seasonal variability was significant for 86% and 50% of compounds in the River Foss and Ouse, respectively. Seasonal variations in flow, in-stream attenuation, usage and septic effluent releases are suspected drivers behind some of the observed temporal exposure variability. When the data were used to evaluate a simple environmental exposure model for pharmaceuticals, mean ratios of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs), obtained using the model, to measured environmental concentrations (MECs) were 0.51 and 0.04 for the River Foss and River Ouse, respectively. Such PEC/MEC ratios indicate that the model underestimates actual concentrations in both river systems, but to a much greater extent in the larger River Ouse. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of microalgal consortia for urban wastewater treatment is an increasing trend, as it allows simultaneous nutrient removal and biomass production. Emerging contaminants proposed for the list of priority substances such as the hormone 17 beta-estradiol are commonly found in urban wastewater, and their removal using algal monocultures has been accomplished. Due to the inherent potential of algae-based systems, this study aimed to assess the capability of native photobioreactor biomass to remove 17 beta-estradiol under indoor and outdoor conditions. At the same time, the microbial community changes in regular and bioaugmented operations with Scenedesmus were assessed. The results show that almost complete removal (>93.75%) of the hormone 17 beta-estradiol can be attained in the system under favourable seasonal conditions, although these conditions greatly influence biomass concentrations and microbial diversity. Even under the harsh conditions of low temperatures and solar irradiation, the established consortium removed more than 50% of the pollutant in 24 h. While species from genus Chlorella were stable during the entire operation, the microbial diversity analysis revealed that assorted and evenly distributed populations stimulate the removal rates. Bioaugmentation assays proved that the input of additional biomass results in higher overall removal and decreases the yield per mg of biomass. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the performance of five different sorbents (granular activated carbon (GAC), GAC + Polonite((R)) (GAC + P), Xylit, lignite and sand) for a set of 83 micropollutants (MPs) (pharmaceuticals, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), personal care products, artificial sweeteners, parabens, pesticide, stimulants), together representing a wide range of physicochemical properties. Treatment with GAC and GAC + P provided the highest removal efficiencies, with average values above 97%. Removal rates were generally lower for Xylit (on average 74%) and lignite (on average 68%), although they proved to be highly efficient for a few individual MPs. The average removal efficiency for sand was only 47%. It was observed that the MPs behaved differently depending on their physicochemical properties. The physicochemical properties of PFASs (i.e. molecular weight, topological molecular surface area, log octanol water partition coefficient (K-ow) and distribution coefficient between octanol and water (log D)) were positively correlated to observed removal efficiency for the sorbents Xylit, lignite and sand (p <0.05), indicating a strong influence of perfluorocarbon chain length and associated hydrophobic characteristics. In contrast, for the other MPs the ratio between apolar and polar surface area (SA/SP) was positively correlated with the removal efficiency, indicating that hydrophobic adsorption may be a key feature of their sorption mechanisms. GAC showed to be the most promising filter medium to improve the removal of MPs in on-site sewage treatment facilities. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the removal of MPs in field trials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic Fe3O4@BiOl@Agl (FBA) spheres were synthesized through a multi-step process. The fabricated photocatalysts were characterized by different techniques. To testify the visible light driven photocatalytic activity of FBA, Rhodamine B and Bisphenol A were chosen as model common and emerging organic contaminants, respectively. While, gram-negative strain Escherichia colt was selected as model waterborne bacteria. The results showed that under visible light irradiation, FBA contained strong photocatalytic degradation capacity towards both RhB and BPA. Moreover, FBA was also found to exhibit excellent disinfection activity towards E. coll. The photocatalytic mechanisms for different pollutants by FBA were determined and found to vary for different pollutants. Specifically, scavenger experiments, degradation intermediates determination, as well as theoretical density functional theory (DFT) analysis showed that RhB and BPA were degraded via photosensitization (dominated by e(-) and center dot O-2(-)) and direct photocatalytic oxidation (contributed by h(+), e(-) and center dot O-2(-)), respectively. Whereas, E. coli cells yet were found to be inactivated by the generation of e(-) and center dot O-2(-) rather than by the released Ag+. Since it contained superparamagnetic property, FBA could be easily separated from the reaction suspension after use. Due to the excellent photo stability, FBA exhibited strong photocatalytic activity in the fourth reused recycle. Therefore, FBA could serve as a promising alternative for water purification.

AB With the increased concentrations and kinds of refractory organic contaminants (ROCs) in aquatic environments, many previous reviews systematically summarized the applications of carbon-based materials in the adsorption and catalytic degradation of ROCs for their economically viable and environmentally friendly behavior. Interestingly, recent studies indicated that carbon-based materials in natural environment can also mediate the transformation of ROCs directly or indirectly due to their abundant persistent free radicals (PFRs). Understanding the formation mechanisms of PFRs in carbo-based materials and their interactions with ROCs is essential to develop their further applications in environment remediation. However, there is no comprehensive review so far about the direct and indirect removal of ROCS mediated by PFRs in amorphous, porous and crystalline carbon-based materials. The review aims to evaluate the formation mechanisms of PFRs in carbon-based materials synthesized through pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization processes. The influence of synthesis conditions (temperature and time) and carbon sources on the types as well as the concentrations of PFRs in carbon based materials are also discussed. In particular, the effects of metals on the concentrations and types of PFRs in carbon-based materials are highlighted because they are considered as the catalysts for the formation of PFRs. The formation mechanisms of reactive species and the further transformation mechanisms of ROCs are briefly summarized, and the surface properties of carbon-based materials including surface area, types and number of functional groups, etc. are found to be the key parameters controlling their activities. However, due to diversity and complexity of carbon-based materials, the exact relationships between the activities of carbon-based materials and PFRs are still uncertain. Finally, the existing problems and current challenges for the ROCs transformation with carbon-based materials are also pointed out. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Food waste water is one of the most urgent environmental problems for the close connection between food and our daily life. Herein, we use a simple hydrothermal method to prepare a highly efficient catalyst-CeO2/Co3O4 compound on the stainless steel mesh, aiming for food waste water treatment Possessing the superhydrophilic property and catalytic ability under ultraviolet light, CeO2/Co3O4 coated mesh has successfully processed three representative contaminants in food wastewater, which are soybean oil (food oil), AR (food dye) and VA (food flavor) simultaneously with an one-step filtration. Besides, the mesh is stable in a wide pH range and performs well in reusability. Therefore, such a multifunctional material with simple preparation method, high processing efficiency and facile operation shows a promising prospect for practical production and application for food wastewater treatment.

AB Arsenic (As) is toxic to human and is often found in drinking water in India and Bangladesh, due to the natural abundance of arsenides ores. Different removal procedures such as precipitation, sorption, ion exchange and membrane separation have been employed for removal of As from contaminated drinking water (CDW), however, there is a critical need for low-cost economically viable biochar modification methods which can enhance As sorption. Here we studied the effectiveness of zero-valent iron (ZVI)biochar complexes produced by high temperature pyrolysis of biomass and magnetite for removing As5+ from CDW. Batch equilibration and column leaching studies show that ZVI-biochar complexes are effective for removing As5+ from CDW for the studied pH range (pH -7-7.5) and in the presence of competing ions. XPS As 3d analysis of ZVI-biochar complexes exposed to As5+ in the batch and column studies show primarily As3+, indicating simultaneous oxidation of Fe degrees to Fe3+ and reduction of As5+ to As3+. SEM-EDS and XRD analyses show isomorphous substitution of As3+ for Fe3+ in neo-formed alpha/gamma-FeOOH on biochar surfaces, which is attribute to co-precipitation. This study also demonstrates the efficacy of pyrolyzing biomass with low-cost iron ores at 900 degrees C to rapidly produce ZVI-biochar complexes, which have potential to be used for treatment of As CDW.

AB This study presents an approach for developing inactivating materials to achieve an initial rapid and a long-term equilibrium P immobilization to control eutrophication based on drinking water treatment residue (DWTR), which is a byproduct of potable water production. By taking advantage of the long-term equilibrium P adsorption by DWTR, the La chemical properties, and the previous success of using La-modified bentonite clay (Phoslock((R))), we used DWTR as a La carrier with different ratios to develop the specific materials. The La loading mechanisms, the potentially toxic effect of La-modified DWTR on snail Bellamya aeruginosa (within 120 d), and the short- and long-term (within 80 d) P immobilization characteristics of the modified DWTR were investigated to understand the performance of the developed materials. The results showed that La loading into DWTR was based on ligand exchanges and the formation of new particles; DWTR loaded with <5% La had no toxicity against the snail. Most importantly, the loading of 5% La to DWTR substantially enhanced the rapid immobilization capacity of DWTR, achieving an initial rapid and a long-term equilibrium P adsorption in aqueous solutions. This study promotes the beneficial recycling of DWTR and results in a win-win situation for lake restoration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays important roles in both abiotic and biotic processes within aquatic ecosystems, and these in turn depend on the quality of the DOM. We collected and characterized chromophoric DOM (CDOM) from different Australian freshwater types (circumneutral, naturally acidic and groundwater-fed waterways), climatic regions and seasons. CDOM quality was characterized using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy. Excitation emission scans followed by parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis showed that CDOM was characterized by three main components: protein-like, fulvic-like and humic-like components commonly associated with various waters globally in the Openfluor database. Principal component analysis showed that CDOM quality varied between naturally acidic, circumneutral and groundwater-fed waters, with unique CDOM quality signatures shown for each freshwater type. CDOM quality also differed significantly within some sites between seasons. Clear differences in dominant CDOM components were shown between freshwater types. Naturally acidic waters were dominated by highly aromatic (as indicated by the specific absorbance co-efficient (SAC(340)) and the specific UV absorbance (SUVA(25)(4) ) values which ranged between 31 and 50 cm(2) mg(-1) and 3.9 -5.7 mg C-1 m(-1) respectively), humic-like CDOM of high molecular weight (as indicated by abs(254)/365 which ranged from 3.8 to 43). In contrast, circumneutral waters were dominated by fulvic-like CDOM of lower aromaticity (SAC(3)(40): 7-21 cm(2) mg(-1) and SUVA(25)(4): 1.5-3.0 mg C-1 m(-1)) and lower molecular weight (abs(254)/365 5.1-9.3). The groundwater-fed site had a higher abundance of protein-like CDOM, which was the least aromatic (SAC(340): 2-5 cm(2) mg(-1) and SUVA(254): 0.58-1.1 mg C-1 m(-1)). CDOM was generally less aromatic, of a lower molecular weight and more autochthonous in nature during the summer/autumn sampling compared to winter/spring. Significant relationships were shown between various CDOM quality parameters and pH. This is the first study to show that different freshwater types (circumneutral, naturally acidic and groundwater-fed) contain distinct CDOM quality signatures in Australia, a continent with unique flora and geology.

AB Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is now commonly used to detect fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) as well as pathogens in water samples. However, DNA loss during sample processing can cause underestimation of target genes. In this study, we created a sample process control strain (SPC) by genetically engineering a non-pathogenic, Gram-negative bacterium Pseudogulbenkiania sp. strain NH8B. The SPC strain, named NH8B-1D2, has a kanamycin-resistance gene inserted to one of the 23S rRNA genes. To specifically quantify the SPC strain, a new TaqMan qPCR assay was developed. To obtain the relationship between the DNA recovery efficiencies of various pathogens and those of the SPC strain, known amount of E. coli 0157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni, or Listeria monocytogenes cells were co-spiked with the SPC strain to environmental water samples. The DNA recovery efficiencies were calculated by comparing the quantity of bacterial cells inoculated to water samples prior to filtration and DNA extraction, and those measured by qPCR. We then obtained the ratios in the recovery efficiencies between pathogens and SPC strain (RRPATH/SPC). The RRPATH/SPC values obtained using Oono pond water collected in Japan were used as a pathogen-specific constant to estimate the accurate concentrations of pathogens in water samples collected from Mississippi River in Minnesota. Estimated pathogen concentrations were not significantly different from the inoculated pathogen concentration, suggesting our normalization approach is useful to estimate the accurate concentrations of pathogens in environmental water samples. The qPCR assay targeting the SPC strains and FIB were incorporated into the microfluidic qPCR chip format (PBQ chip ver. 2); therefore, we can simultaneously quantify multiple pathogens, FIB, and the SPC strain in high throughput from many water samples. This new tool can be useful for water quality monitoring and risk assessment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A passive water sampler based on the diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique was developed and tested for 3 groups of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs, including oestrogens, alkyl-phenols and bisphenols). Three different resins (hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced (HLB), XAD18 and Strata-XL-A (SXLA)) were investigated for their suitability as the binding phase for DGT devices. Laboratory tests across a range of pH (3.5-9.5), ionic strength (0.001-0.5 M) and dissolved organic matter concentration (0-20 mg L-1) showed HLB and XAD18-DGT devices were more stable compared to SXLA-DGT. HLB-DGT and XAD18-DGT accumulated test chemicals with time consistent with theoretical predictions, while SXLA-DGT accumulated reduced amounts of chemical. DGT performance was also compared in field deployments up to 28 days, alongside conventional active sampling at a wastewater treatment plant Uptake was linear to the samplers over 18 days, and then began to plateau/decline, indicating the maximum deployment time in those conditions. Concentrations provided by the DGT samplers compared well with those provided by auto-samplers. DGT integrated concentrations over the deployment period in a way that grab-sampling cannot. The advantages of the DGT sampler over active sampling include: low cost, ease of simultaneous multi-site deployment, in situ analyte pre-concentration and reduction of matrix interferences compared with conventional methods. Compared to other passive sampler designs, DGT uptake is independent of flow rate and therefore allows direct derivation of field concentrations from measured compound diffusion coefficients. This passive DGT sampler therefore constitutes a viable and attractive alternative to conventional grab and active water sampling for routine monitoring of selected EDCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) based advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) are effective for removing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during water treatment. In this study, we systematically investigated the degradation kinetics of naproxen (NAP), a representative NSAID, with a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. The second-order rate constant (k) of (OH)-O-center dot oxidation of NAP was measured to be (4.32 +/- 0.04) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), which was in a reasonable agreement with transition state theory calculated k value (1.08 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)) at SMD/M05-2X/6-311++G**//M05-2X/6-31+G** level of theory. The calculated result revealed that the dominant reaction intermediate is 2-(5-hydroxy-6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)propanoic acid (HMNPA) formed via radical adduct formation pathway, in which (OH)-O-center dot addition onto the ortho site of the methoxy-substituted benzene ring is the most favorable pathway for the NAP oxidation. We further investigated the subsequent (OH)-O-center dot oxidation of HMNPA via a kinetic modelling technique. The k value of the reaction of HMNPA and (OH)-O-center dot was determined to be 2.22 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) exhibiting a similar reactivity to the parent NAP. This is the first study on the kinetic and mechanistic aspects of NAP and its reaction intermediates. The current results are valuable in future study evaluating and extending the application of (OH)-O-center dot based AOTs to degrade NAP and other NSAIDs of concern in water treatment plants.

AB Degradation of three lipid regulators, i.e., gemfibrozil, bezafibrate and clofibric acid, by a UV/chlorine treatment was systematically investigated. The chlorine oxide radical (ClO center dot) played an important role in the degradation of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate with second-order rate constants of 4.2 (+/- 0.3) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) and 3.6 (+/- 0.1) x 10(7) M-1 s(-1), respectively, whereas UV photolysis and the hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) mainly contributed to the degradation of clofibric acid. The first-order rate constants (k') for the degradation of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate increased linearly with increasing chlorine dosage, primarily due to the linear increase in the ClO center dot concentration. The k' values for gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, and clofibric acid degradation decreased with increasing pH from 5.0 to 8.4; however, the contribution of the reactive chlorine species (RCS) increased. Degradation of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate was enhanced in the presence of Br- , whereas it was inhibited in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). The presence of ammonia at a chlorine: ammonia molar ratio of 1:1 resulted in decreases in the k' values for gemfibrozil and bezafibrate of 69.7% and 7%, respectively, but led to an increase in that for clofibric acid of 61.8%. Degradation of gemfibrozil by ClO center dot was initiated by hydroxylation and chlorine substitution on the benzene ring. Then, subsequent hydroxylation, bond cleavage and chlorination reactions led to the formation of more stable products. Three chlorinated intermediates were identified during ClO center dot oxidation process. Formation of the chlorinated disinfection by-products chloral hydrate and 1,1,1-trichloropropanone was enhanced relative to that of other by-products. The acute toxicity of gemfibrozil to Vibrio fischeri increased significantly when subjected to direct UV photolysis, whereas it decreased when oxidized by ClO center dot. This study is the first to report the transformation pathway of a micropollutant by ClO center dot. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The photochemical conversion and microbial transformation of pollutants mediated by dissolved organic matter (DOM), including 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), are often accompanied in natural water. However, there are few studies to explore the connection and mechanism between the two processes. This research aims to investigate the mechanism of DOM after electrochemically modification mediated EE2 combining photodegradation and biodegradation in the environment and it want to explain the natural phenomena of DOM after electrochemical advanced treatment entering the water environment mediated EE2 natural degradation. The results showed that combining photodegradation with biodegradation rates of EE2 mediated by DOM and electrochemically modified DOM (E-DOM) were promoted obviously. The efficiency of EE2 biodegradation was shown to be strongly correlated with electron accepting capacity (EAC) of DOM. Electrochemical modification can increase the EAC of DOM leading to EE2 biodegradation accelerated, and it also can form more triplet-state DOM moieties to promote the EE2 photodegradation in irradiation conditions, due to the increasing of quinone-type structures in DOM. Moreover, cell polymeric secretion (CPS) secreted from the microorganism could be stimulated to an excited state by irradiation, and that also accelerated EE2 degradation. Photolysis combined with biochemical degradation yielded less toxic degradation products. This study shows that the emission of DOM in wastewater after electrochemical treatment could accelerate estrogen degradation and play a positive role on the pollutant transformation in the environment.

AB Denitrifying enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) systems can be an efficient means of removing phosphate (P) and nitrate (NO3-) with low carbon source and oxygen requirements. Tetrasphaera is one of the most abundant polyphosphate accumulating organisms present in EBPR systems, but their capacity to achieve denitrifying EBPR has not previously been determined. An enriched Tetrasphaera culture, comprising over 80% of the bacterial biovolume was obtained in this work. Despite the denitrification capacity of Tetrasphaera, this culture achieved only low levels of anoxic P-uptake. Batch tests with different combinations of NO3-, nitrite (NO2-) and nitrous oxide (N2O) revealed lower N2O accumulation by Tetrasphaera as compared to Accumulibacter and Competibacter when multiple electron acceptors were added. Electron competition was observed during the addition of multiple nitrogen electron acceptors species, where P uptake appeared to be slightly favoured over glycogen production in these situations. This study increases our understanding of the role of Tetrasphaera-related organisms in denitrifying EBPR systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphite (P+III) is of emerging chemical interest due to its importance within the global phosphorus cycle. Yet, to date, precise/accurate measurements of P+III are still lacking due to the inherent analytical challenges linked to its instability/ease of oxidation and ultra-trace concentration. Here, we present the first in-situ sampling and speciation analysis method, for dissolved P+III, using the diffusive-gradients-in-thin-films (DGT) technique, combined with capillary-column-configured-dual-ion-chromatography (CC-DIC). Method optimization of the DGT elution regime, to simultaneously maximize desorption efficiency and CC-DIC sensitivity, along with the characterization of diffusion coefficients for P+III, were undertaken before full method validation. Laboratory-performance testing confirmed DGT-P(+III)acquisition to be independent of pH (3.0-10.0) and ionic strength (0-500 mM). The capacity for P+III was 45.8 mu g cm(-2), while neither P+v/(up to 10 mg L-1) nor As+v(up to 1 mgL(-1)) impacted the DGT-P+III measurement. This novel method's functionality stems from the herein confirmed speciation preservation and double preconcentration of P+III, resulting in quantification limits as low as 7.44 ng L-1 for a 3-day deployment. Applications of this method in various terrestrial/aquatic environments were demonstrated and simultaneous profiles of P+III and P+v across a sediment-water interface were captured at mm resolution in two contrasting redox-mesocosm systems.

AB We assessed the utility of online fluorescence spectroscopy for the real-time evaluation of the microbial quality of untreated drinking water. Online fluorimeters were installed on the raw water intake at four groundwater-derived UK public water supplies alongside existing turbidity sensors that are used to forewarn of the presence of microbial contamination in the water industry. The fluorimeters targeted fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM) peaks at excitation/emission wavelengths of 280/365 nm (tryptophan-like fluorescence, TLF) and 280/450 nm (humic-like fluorescence, HLF). Discrete samples were collected for Escherichia coif, total bacterial cell counts by flow cytometry, and laboratory-based fluorescence and absorbance. Both TLF and HLF were strongly correlated with E. coli (p = 0.71-0.77) and total bacterial cell concentrations (p = 0.73-0.76), whereas the correlations between turbidity and E. coli (p = 0.48) and total bacterial cell counts (p = 0.40) were much weaker. No clear TLF peak was observed at the sites and all apparent TLF was considered to be optical bleed-through from the neighbouring HLF peak. Therefore, a HLF fluorimeter alone would be sufficient to evaluate the microbial water quality at these sources. Fluorescent DOM was also influenced by site operations such as pump start-up and the precipitation of cations on the sensor windows. Online fluorescent DOM sensors are a better indicator of the microbial quality of untreated drinking water than turbidity and they have wide-ranging potential applications within the water industry.

AB Tetracycline (TC) is one of the most widely used antibiotics with significant impacts on human health and thus it needs appropriate approaches for its removal. In the present study, we evaluated the performance and complete pathway of the TC electrochemical oxidation on a Ti/Ti4O7 anode prepared by plasma spraying. Morphological data and composition analysis indicated a compact coating layer on the anode, which had the characteristic peaks of Ti4O7 as active constituent The TC electrochemical oxidation on the Ti/Ti4O7 anode followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the TC removal efficiency reached 95.8% in 40 min. The influential factors on TC decay kinetics included current density, anode-cathode distance and initial TC concentration. This anode also had high durability and the TC removal efficiency was maintained over 95% after five times reuse. For the first time, we unraveled the complete pathway of the TC electrochemical oxidation using high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) and gas chromatograph (GC) coupled with mass spectrometer (MS). center dot OH radicals produced from electrochemical oxidation attack the double bond, phenolic group and amine group of TC, forming a primary intermediate (m/z = 461), secondary intermediates (m/z = 432, 477 and 509) and tertiary intermediates (rn/z = 480, 448 and 525). The latter were further oxidized to the key downstream intermediate (m/z = 496), followed by further downstream intermediates (rn/z = 451, 412, 396, 367, 351, 298 and 253) and eventually short-chain carboxylic acids. We also evaluated the toxicity change during the electrochemical oxidation process with bioluminescent bacteria. The bioluminescence inhibition ratio peaked at 10 min (55.41%), likely owing to the high toxicity of intermediates with m/z = 461, 432 and 477 as obtained from quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. The bioluminescence inhibition ratio eventually decreased to 16.78% in 40 min due to further transformation of TC and intermediates. By comprehensively analyzing the influential factors and complete degradation pathway of it electrochemical oxidation on the Ti/Ti4O7 anode, our research provides deeper insights into the risk assessment of intermediates and their toxicity, assigning new perspectives for practical electrochemical oxidation to effectively eliminate the amount and toxicity of TC and other antibiotics in wastewater.

AB The continuous increase in synthetic plastic production and poor management in plastic waste have led to a tremendous increase in the dumping into our aqueous environment. Consequently, microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5 mm are produced and stay in both seawater and freshwater environment. The presence of microplastics as a new type of emerging contaminant has become a great issue of concerns from public and government authorities. The sources of microplastics to freshwater systems are many with the largest portion from wastewater treatment plants. The abundance of microplastics varies with the location, from above 1 million pieces per cubic meter to less than I piece in 100 cubic meters.
   Microplastics can cause several harmful physical effects on humans and living organisms through such mechanisms as entanglement and ingestion. The microplastics can act as carriers of various toxins such as additives from industrial production processes and persistent contaminants by the sorption in waters. Those toxins may cause great health problems to humans. A few studies on the fishes demonstrated that the microplastics and the associated toxins are bio-accumulated and cause such problems as intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles.
   In studies of microplastics, fresh water is first sampled by the nets with typical mesh size of 330 pm for collection of microplastics. After the volume reducing process, the samples will then go through the purification process including density separation by such inorganic salts as sodium chloride and digestion process by oxidizing agents or enzymes. The sequence of these two processes (namely purification and digestion) is dependent on the sample type. The purified samples can be studied by several analytical methods. The commonly used methods for the qualification studies are FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and liquid chromatography. A tagging method can be used in the quantification study. Our literature study finds that there is still no universal accepted quantification and qualification tools of microplastics in fresh waters. More work is anticipated so as to obtain accurate information on microplastics in freshwater, which can then be used for the better assessment of the environmental risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Leaching of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) has been reported as a pathway of N loss from agriculture, but the molecular composition of DON in agricultural water is poorly understood. Runoff water samples were collected from citrus grove furrows (CGF), ditches (CGD) and pasture ditches (PD) in four seasons. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) was used to investigate molecular composition of DON. Chemodiversity index of DON had spatiotemporal variations, while the molecular composition of total DON showed minimal variations, except for PD in November. Lignin derivatives constituted 61% of the total DON compounds. Relative abundance of aliphatic compounds, char and condensed aromatics of unique DON compounds varied spatiotemporally and had a significant correlation with DON concentration. Aromaticity index decreased from CGF to connected CGD, implying that photodegradation is possibly the dominant process that alters molecular composition of aquatic DON during the transport. Significant differences in unique DON composition between CGD and PD indicates that fertilization and land use affect DON composition. The information on molecular characterization of DON should be useful for tracking DON source and developing technologies to remove DON in the agricultural runoff water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Enhanced fouling resistance has been observed in recent variants of reverse osmosis (RO) desalination which use time-varying batch or semi-batch processes, such as dosed-circuit RO (CCRO) and pulse flow RO (PFRO). However, the mechanisms of batch processes' fouling resistance are not well-understood, and models have not been developed for prediction of their fouling performance. Here, a framework for predicting reverse osmosis fouling is developed by comparing the fluid residence time in batch and continuous (conventional) reverse osmosis systems to the nucleation induction times for crystallization of sparingly soluble salts. This study considers the inorganic foulants calcium sulfate (gypsum), calcium carbonate (calcite), and silica, and the work predicts maximum recovery ratios for the treatment of typical water sources using batch reverse osmosis (BRO) and continuous reverse osmosis. The prediction method is validated through comparisons to the measured time delay for CaSO4 membrane scaling in a benchscale, recirculating reverse osmosis unit. The maximum recovery ratio for each salt solution (CaCO3, CaSO4) is individually predicted as a function of inlet salinity, as shown in contour plots. Next, the maximum recovery ratios of batch and conventional RO are compared across several water sources, including seawater, brackish groundwater, and RO brine. Batch RO's shorter residence times, associated with cycling from low to high salinity during each batch, enable significantly higher recovery ratios and higher salinity than in continuous RO for all cases examined. Finally, representative brackish RO brine samples were analyzed to determine the maximum possible recovery with batch RO. Overall, the induction time modeling methodology provided here can be used to allow batch RO to operate at high salinity and high recovery, while controlling scaling. The results show that, in addition to its known energy efficiency improvement, batch RD has superior inorganic fouling resistance relative to conventional RO. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the present study, the 75% alcoholic fractionation of excretory-secretory (ES) antigen isolated from 200 to 300 live P. epiclitum was assessed for its diagnostic potential for the detection of caprine amphistomosis by using antibody detection enzyme immunoassay. Prior to enzyme immunoassay, 75% alcoholic fractionation of excretory-secretory (ES) antigen was subjected to SDS- PAGE and western blot analysis for the presence of immunoreactive polypeptides SDS-PAGE analysis of ES antigen resolved a total 7 polypeptides bands of size 56, 27, 25, 22.5, 12, 11 and l0kDa. Western blot analysis revealed only two immunoreactive polypeptides (11 kDa and 12 kDa) when polypeptides resolved in SDS-PAGE were probed with known positive pooled serum. None of the polypeptides showed reactions with pooled known negative serum. The working dilutions of antigen, sera and conjugates were determined by checkerboard titration for employing ELISA and cut-off O.D. was calculated 0.616 by using the mean absorbance value of 11 negative kid sera. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA was found to be 100% and 86.76%, respectively. As per kappa value estimation, the strength of agreement was found to be good. Antibodies to 75% alcoholic fractionation of ES antigen was detected in 20% goats (n = 160) of either sex, although faecal examination detected 10.6% goats to be infected with amphistomosis. The study confirmed that 75% alcoholic fractionation of ES antigen of P. epiclitum based ELISA had good value for serodiagnosis of caprine amphistomosis.

AB The most commonly used culture medium for the in vitro isolation of Leishmania spp. from canine biological samples is biphasic Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle (NNN) medium, whose solid phase is prepared using rabbit blood. Leishmania infantum parasites from natural infections are highly sensitive and demanding for growth in axenic conditions when firstly obtained from the dog's body. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether NNN medium (NNN-test) prepared with chicken blood (NNN-C), ox blood (NNN-O), horse blood (NNN-H) or sheep blood (NNN-S) was viable for the isolation of parasites from naturally infected dogs, in an endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum Spleen aspirates from six dogs previously diagnosed as infected by parasitological methods were simultaneously inoculated in each NNN-test medium, including the conventional medium prepared with rabbit blood (NNN-R), and the cultures were examined for three weeks under optic microscopy. Spleen samples were also analyzed for parasite loads by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Cultures from three of the six dogs (50%) were positive in at least one of the NNN-test media: one sample presented the highest spleen parasite load by qPCR (1.19 x 10(4) parasites/mL) and was positive in all test media; the second sample presented parasitic isolation in the first week of culture in all inoculated media, of which the NNN-C medium had the highest mean parasite count (NNN-C = 23.5 x 10(4)/mL vs. NNN-R = 3.25 x 10(4)/mL); the third sample was positive only in the NNN-S medium besides the conventional control NNN-R. Cultures from the three remaining dogs were negative in all NNN media, including the control and test media; of those three dogs, two presented the lowest spleen parasitic loads according to qPCR. Blood from chicken, ox, horse and sheep shown to be viable for the preparation of NNN culture medium for the primary isolation of L. infantum from samples of naturally infected dogs and can be considered as an alternative to rabbit blood when necessary.

AB Ticks are an important but under recognized parasitic threat to cats in many areas of the United States. To characterize the species and stages of ticks most commonly recovered from cats and determine the prevalence of disease agents in the ticks, we conducted a survey of ticks removed from cats at veterinary practices in 18 states from April 2016 June 2017. A total of 796 ticks were submitted from 332 cats from 41 different veterinary practices. A single tick was submitted from the majority of cats, with a mean infestation intensity of 2.4 (range 1-46). The most common tick was Ixodes scapularis, accounting for 422/796 (53.0%) ticks submitted, followed by Amblyomma americanum (224/796; 28.1%) and Dermacentor variabilis (131/796; 16.5%); a few I. pacificus, I. banksi, D. occidentalis, A. maculatum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and Otobius megnini were also submitted. A majority of ticks were adults (593/796; 74.5%); females predominated in all adult tick submissions including I. scapularis (277/327; 84.7% female), A. americanum (66/128; 51.6% female), and D. variabilis (75/126; 59.5% female). Immature ticks included 186 nymphs and 17 larvae and were primarily I. scapularis and A. americanum. Adult I. scapularis were most reported to be attached to the dorsal head and neck; A. americanum to the abdomen and perianal region; and D. variabilis to the back and ear. Ticks were collected in every month; the largest number of submissions were in May and June (42.5% of ticks) and October and November (35.9% of ticks). Adults of I. scapularis were most commonly submitted October through December, A. americanum March through June, and D. variabilis May through July. Cats with ticks were predominantly male (58.8%) and altered (76.2%), and most reportedly spent > 30% of time outdoors, although 64/294 (21.8%) for which lifestyle estimates were provided were reported to live primarily (30% of time outside; n = 54) or entirely (100%; n = 10) indoors. Assay of ticks removed from cats revealed I. scapularis were infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (25.7%) and Anapiasma phagocytophilum (4.4%); A. americanum were infected with Ehrlichia chaffeensis (1.3%); and D. variabilis were infected with spotted fever group Rickettsia spp. (3.1%). No ticks in this study tested positive for Cytauxzoon fells. Pet cats, including those that live primarily indoors, are at risk of tick infestation, potentially exposed to tick-borne disease agents, and would benefit from routine tick control.

ID DRUG EFFICACY; MINI-FLOTAC; MCMASTER
AB Gastrointestinal nematode parasites are important pathogens of all domesticated livestock species. Fecal egg counts (FEC) are routinely used for evaluating anthelmintic efficacy and for making targeted anthelmintic treatment decisions. Numerous FEC techniques exist and vary in precision and accuracy. These performance characteristics are especially important when performing fecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT). The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy and precision of three commonly used FEC methods and determine if differences existed among livestock species. In this study, we evaluated the modified-Wisconsin, 3-chamber (high-sensitivity) McMaster, and Mini-FLOTAC methods in cattle, sheep, horses, and llamas in three phases. In the first phase, we performed an egg-spiking study to assess the egg recovery rate and accuracy of the different FEC methods. In the second phase, we examined clinical samples from four different livestock species and completed multiple replicate FEC using each method. In the last phase, we assessed the cheesecloth straining step as a potential source of egg loss.
   In the egg-spiking study, the Mini-FLOTAC recovered 70.9% of the eggs, which was significantly higher than either the McMaster (P = 0.002) or Wisconsin (P = 0.002). In the clinical samples from ruminants, Mini-FLOTAC consistently yielded the highest EPG, revealing a significantly higher level of egg recovery (P < 0.0001). For horses and llamas, both McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC yielded significantly higher EPG than Wisconsin (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.024). Mini-FLOTAC was the most accurate method and was the most precise test for both species of ruminants. The Wisconsin method was the most precise for horses and McMaster was more precise for llama samples. We compared the Wisconsin and Mini-FLOTAC methods using a modified technique where both methods were performed using either the Mini-FLOTAC sieve or cheesecloth. The differences in the estimated mean EPG on log scale between the Wisconsin and mini-FLOTAC methods when cheesecloth was used (P < 0.0001) and when cheesecloth was excluded (P < 0.0001) were significant, providing strong evidence that the straining step is an important source of error. The high accuracy and precision demonstrated in this study for the Mini-FLOTAC, suggest that this method can be recommended for routine use in all host species. The benefits of Mini-FLOTAC will be especially relevant when high accuracy is important, such as when performing FECRT.

AB Culicoides biting midges can transmit viruses such as bluetongue virus and Schmallenberg virus to ruminants and African horse sickness virus to equines. The control of Culicoides population can be based on physical and/or chemical methods. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of larvicides and adulticides combined treatments to control the vector Culicoides populations. Field trials have been conducted during 2014 on seven farms in northern Sardinia (Italy). Three insecticide treatments (larvicides and adulticides) have been carried out on three farms, whereas four farms remained unsprayed as untreated controls. For the larval control two commercial formulations, based on diflubenzuron and Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (H-14), have been used. Against adults a deltamethrin based product has been sprayed on the walls and roofs of animal shelters. Adult Culicoides have been collected on each farm twice a week with an Onderstepoort blacklight suction trap. After each treatment a significant reduction in the abundance of total Culicoides, C. imicola and C. newsteadi s.l., has been observed. The Obsoletus complex density has been affected by the first two treatments. Our results suggest the possibility to control the Culicoides populations with a combination of adulticide and larvicide treatments.

AB During Fasciola hepatica infection, the parasite has the capability to modulate the host immune response towards a non-protector Th2 type instead of Th1. This type of immune response is closely related to the alternative activation of macrophages (M2 profile) as has been shown in vivo in murine models. In this study, an experiment was carried out in order to evaluate the expression of CD68, CD14, CD206 and iNOS in cells present in the peritoneal fluid of sheep during early stages of infection with F. hepatica (1, 3, 9 and 18 days post-infection, dpi) by immunocytochemistry. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report that studies the in vivo immunophenotype of macrophages from the peritoneal fluid of sheep infected with F. hepatica. Throughout the experiments the absolute number of leucocytes progressively increased, reaching its highest value at 18 dpi, mainly due to the increase of eosinophils. This immunocytochemical study had two purposes: 1) CD68 expression was assessed with Hansel counterstaining, to optimally identify peritoneal macrophages, eosinophils and lymphocytes; 2) expression of CD14, CD206 and iNOS was evaluated to identify alternative or classical pathways of macrophage activation. The results showed a significant increase in CD14 from day 3 dpi compared with the non-infected group. CD206 expression at all time points showed a significant and dramatic increase in comparison with the uninfected group. On the other hand, iNOS expression showed little variation, and was significantly decreased at 18 dpi in comparison with the uninfected group. These results suggest that F. hepatica induces an alternative activation of peritoneal macrophages of sheep from the first day post-infection, which may facilitate parasite survival. This is the first report describing M2 activation of peritoneal macrophages in ruminants infected with F. hepatica.

AB Monepantel resistance was diagnosed during routine monitoring of the effectiveness of a farm's roundworm control strategy. Weaned lambs had become ill thrifty and developed diarrhoea, despite the routine use of monepantel. This clinical presentation was caused by trichostrongylosis. The faecal egg count reduction was 76.7% (95% CI: 55.1-82.2%) following treatment with 2.5mg/kg monepantel. Predominantly Trichostrongylus vitrinus along with small proportions of Oesophagostomum venulosum and Trichostrongylus vitrinus were identified by deep amplicon sequencing of pools of larvae recovered from pre and post monepantel treatment copro-cultures and on postmortem examinations. The undifferentiated FECRT showed resistance to monepantel, but not to levamisole, ivermectin, or moxidectin. Examination of farm anthelmintic treatment and animal movement records suggested that treatments before movement onto silage aftermaths, putatively with low numbers of susceptible nematodes in refugia, may have placed a high selection pressure on monepantel resistance. Effective control of parasitic gastroenteritis using anthelmintic drugs is a prerequisite for sustainable sheep production. This case reiterates the need for care when combining anthelmintic treatments with movements to safe grazing, and the value of monitoring of anthelmintic efficacy as part of iterative planned animal health management.

TI Peripheral venous vs. capillary microfilariaemia in a dog co-infected

AB Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens are mosquito-borne nematodes, primarily infecting dogs, but also other species of carnivores and even humans. Given their impact on animal and human health, the transmission of these filarioids has been widely studied. The microfilariaemia has been shown to have a circadian variation for both Dirofilaria species infecting dogs. Due to methodological difficulties, the periodicity was only studied using venous blood samples, while the mosquitoes feed, in fact, on capillary blood. In this context, the present study aimed to test the feasibility of using triatomine bugs for the collection of capillary blood and to comparatively evaluate the level of microfilariaemia and its circadian variation in capillary blood vs. peripheral venous blood in a dog naturally co-infected with D. immitis and D. repens. The results showed a feeding success of 50%, with variations in the blood meal volume that the bugs ingested. The relative values of microfilariaemia (mf/bug) were strongly correlated with the volume of blood recovered: the more blood recovered from each bug, the higher values of microfilariaemia in the evening samples while the opposite results were obtained for the morning samples. The counting of microfilariae revealed a dominance of D. immitis in all the samples, but with significantly higher microfilariaemia in the venous blood. Meanwhile, for D. repens, the situation was opposite, with higher counts in the capillary blood samples. Our study showed that triatomine bugs can be used as a model for the collection and study of microfilariaemia in the capillary blood in mammals.s

AB Equine strongyle parasites are considered ubiquitous in grazing equids across the world, and cyathostomin parasites are known pathogens causing well-described disease complexes in horses. Decades of intensive anthelmintic treatments have led to anthelmintic resistance in cyathostomins, and current recommendations are to lower treatment intensity and base control strategies on fecal egg count surveillance. Little is known about risk factors associated with strongyle parasite egg shedding patterns in the United States equine population, as the most recent national survey was conducted 20 years ago. The present study was carried out as part of the National Animal Health Monitoring Systems (NAHMS) Equine 2015-2016 study. The aims were to describe strongyle parasite egg shedding patterns in the United States equine population and identify risk factors associated with prevalence and egg count magnitude. Data were collected from equine operations in 28 states via questionnaires and fecal samples submitted to a parasitology research laboratory for fecal egg count analysis and the data gathered underwent comprehensive statistical analyses. Though region and season were related, overall, the summer months and the fall in the southeast tended to have the greatest odds of presence of strongyles eggs on a FEC. Generally, equids resident in the Western region (Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, Oregon, and Wyoming) had significantly lower strongyle prevalence, no matter the season, as well as a markedly different distribution between strongyle egg shedding levels (p = 0.0005). Overall, egg counts were over-dispersed with about 27% of equids (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 20-34%) contributing 80% of the egg output. Pasture history was significantly associated with strongyle egg prevalence (p = 0.0003) and egg shedding levels (p = 0.0063) with daily access in the previous 30 days being associated with higher odds of presence and greater median egg count levels. Equid gender was significantly associated with strongylid presence (p = 0.0081) and egg count level (p = 0.0008), with male equids having significantly lower odds and median egg counts than female equids, and age was significantly negatively associated with strongylid prevalence (p < 0.0001). Time since last deworming was significantly positively associated with prevalence of strongyle eggs, and this was dependent on the class of dewormer used (p = 0.0086), with equids treated with macrocyclic lactone class of drugs having lower odds of strongyle egg presence at 120 days since the last deworming. These data provide useful insights into strongylid egg shedding patterns in the United States equine population, and they can help refine parasite control recommendations depending on region, pasture access, and age distribution.

AB The Mw 6.1 2014 Ludian, Yunnan, China earthquake triggered numerous coseismic landslides that do not appear to be associated with any previously known seismogenic fault. Traditional models of triggering for seismically generated landslides do not provide a reasonable explanation for the landslide pattern observed here. Here the Newmark method is applied to a grid to calculate the minimum accelerations required for slope failures throughout the affected region. The results demonstrate that for much of the study area, the distribution of failure prone slopes is similar to the actual pattern of coseismic landslides, however there are some areas where the model predicts considerably fewer failures than occurred. We suggest that this is a result of the complex source faults that generated the Ludian earthquake, which produced a half -conjugate rupture on nearly EW- and NNW trending faults at depth. The rupture directed much of its seismic moment southeast of the epicenter, increasing ground shaking and the number of resulting landslides.

AB Investigating potential forcing mechanisms of terrestrial summer temperature changes from the Asian summer monsoon influenced area is of importance to better understand the climate variability in these densely populated regions. The results of spectral and wavelet analyses of the published chironomid reconstructed mean July temperature data from Tiancai Lake on the SE Tibetan Plateau are presented. The evidence of solar forcing of the summer temperature variability from the site on centennial timescales where key solar periodicities (at 855 +/- 40, 465 +/- 40, 315 +/- 40 and 165 +/- 40 year) are revealed. By using a band-pass filter, coherent fluctuations were found in the strength of Asian summer monsoon, Northern Hemisphere high latitude climate and high elevation mid -latitude (26 degrees N) terrestrial temperatures with solar sunspot cycles since about 7.6 ka. The two abrupt cooling events detected from the Tiancai Lake record, centered at similar to 9.7 and 3.5 ka were examined respectively. Coupled with the paleoclimate modeling results, the early Holocene event (9.7 ka) is possibly linked to an ocean -atmospheric feedback mechanism whereas the latter event (3.5 ka) may be more directly related to external forcing.

AB Source parameters of the small to moderate earthquakes are significant for understanding the dynamic rupture process, the scaling relations of the earthquakes and for assessment of seismic hazard potential of a region. In this study, the source parameters were determined for 58 small to moderate size earthquakes (3.0 <= M-w <= 5.0) occurred during 2007-2015 in the Garhwal-Kumaun region. The estimated shear wave quality factor (Q(beta)(f)) values for each station at different frequencies have been applied to eliminate any bias in the determination of source parameters. The Q(beta)(f) values have been estimated by using coda wave normalization method in the frequency range 1.5-16 Hz. A frequency -dependent S wave quality factor relation is obtained as Q(beta)(f) = (152.9 +/- 7) f((0.82 +/- 0.005)) by fitting a power-law frequency dependence model for the estimated values over the whole study region. The spectral (low-frequency spectral level and corner frequency) and source (static stress drop, seismic moment, apparent stress and radiated energy) parameters are obtained assuming omega(-2) source model. The displacement spectra are corrected for estimated frequency -dependent attenuation, site effect using spectral decay parameter "Kappa". The frequency resolution limit was resolved by quantifying the bias in corner frequencies, stress drop and radiated energy estimates due to finite -bandwidth effect. The data of the region shows shallow focused earthquakes with low stress drop. The estimation of Zilffiga parameter (epsilon) suggests the partial stress drop mechanism in the region. The observed low stress drop and apparent stress can be explained by partial stress drop and low effective stress model. Presence of subsurface fluid at seismogenic depth certainly manipulates the dynamics of the region. However, the limited event selection may strongly bias the scaling relation even after taking as much as possible precaution in considering effects of finite bandwidth, attenuation and site corrections. Although, the scaling can be improved further with the integration of large dataset of microearthquakes and use of a stable and robust approach.

AB Inversion of receiver functions is commonly used to recover the S-wave velocity structure beneath seismic stations. Traditional approaches are based on deconvolved waveforms, where the horizontal component of P wave seismograms is deconvolved by the vertical component. Deconvolution of noisy seismograms is a numerically unstable process that needs to be stabilized by regularization parameters. This biases noise statistics, making it difficult to estimate uncertainties in observed receiver functions for Bayesian inference. This study proposes a method to directly invert observed radial waveforms and to better account for data noise in a Bayesian formulation. We illustrate its feasibility with two synthetic tests having different types of noises added to seismograms. Then, a real site application is performed to obtain the 1-D S-wave velocity structure beneath a seismic station located in the Tengchong volcanic area, Southwestern China. Surface wave dispersion measurements spanning periods from 8 to 65 s are jointly inverted with P waveforms. The results show a complex S wave velocity structure, as two low velocity zones are observed in the crust and uppermost mantle, suggesting the existence of magma chambers, or zones of partial melt. The upper magma chambers may be the heart source that cause the thermal activity on the surface.

The results show that between 35.3 Ma and 31.0 Ma, delta C-13(TOC) ranged from- 26.72 parts per thousand to- 21.27 parts per thousand. The main change occurred at 33.4 Ma, when 813Groc became heavier by 3 parts per thousand. At this time the long-chain n-alkane members (C-27, C-29 and C-31) were dominant, suggesting the most likely sources of organic matter were terrestrial plants. Combining these results with existing measurements of plant delta C-13(TOC) and sporopollen data in adjacent areas, we infer that this change at 33.4 Ma might have been caused by an increase in gymnosperm content especially coniferous trees adapted to cold climates, which have a heavier delta C-13(TOC) than that of the angiosperms, this would have been a response to the global cooling characteristic of this period.

TI Paleo-environmental conditions of the Early Cambrian Niutitang Formation

AB The Precambrian/Cambrian transition was a key time in Earth history, especially for marine biological evolution and oceanic chemistry. The redox-stratification with oxic shallow water and anoxic (even euxinic) deeper water in the Early Cambrian Yangtze Sea, which gradually became completely oxygenated, has been suggested as a possible trigger for the "Cambrian explosion" of biological diversity. However, for some areas in northern Guizhou where the exploration and research are lacking, identifying this pattern of redox-stratification by paleoenvironmental analysis from borehole data is still in need. Here, we report a remarkable variation range in trace elements (Mo, V, U, Ni, Th, Co, Sc, Zn and Cu), molar Corg:P ratios and pyrite morphology from 27 core samples from one new drill hole (XY1, located in the Fenggang area, northern Guizhou) on the Yangtze Platform, South China.
   High levels of Ba (from 3242 ppm to 33,800 ppm) and total organic carbon (TOC; from 4% to 9.36%) in 15 core samples in the Lower Member (LM) of the Niutitang Formation indicated elevated primary productivity in the study area. Redox change was recorded based on enrichment factors (EFs) for RSTEs (Mo, U, and V), redox proxies (V/(V + Ni), Ni/Co, V/Sc and Th/U), C-org:P ratios and particle size of framboidal pyrite. These signatures demonstrate that the LM was deposited under anoxic conditions with sulfidic episodes, whereas the Upper Member (UM) of the Niutitang Formation was deposited under suboxic/oxic conditions with intermittently anoxic episodes. Mo/TOC ratios (from 3.72 to 39.86, mean 18.76) suggest weak -moderate water mass restriction. Mo-U covariation patterns (strong but variable enrichment of Mo and U; Mow, ranging from 31.45 to 257.97; U-EF ranging from 4.68 to 39.07) in the LM show alternation of particulate shuttling and redox conditions occurred in the Early Cambrian Yangtze Sea, whereas Mo-U covariation patterns (moderate Mo enrichment but depletion or non -enrichment of U; mean Mo-EF: 7.29; mean U-EF: 0.95) in the UM may indicate the combined influence of particulate shuttling and diagenetic diffusion of U via bioactivities, which result in low U values and an anoxic signature from frambiodal pyrite particle size (mean: 4.556 mu m; median: 4.41 mu m). Additionally, ex- cess Ba (Ba-xs) concentration (33,800 ppm and 32,500 ppm) and association patterns of trace-metal enrichment in the LM indicate the existence of submarine hydrothermal events. In addition, during deposition of the UM, bioactivities indicated by Mo-U systematics and oxic conditions indicated by redox sensitive trace elements (RSTEs) and multiple -proxies, may be a cause of biological diversification recorded in the Early Cambrian. Finally, data in this record a progressive transition from anoxic bottom waters with euxinic episodes to overwhelming oxic conditions during Early Cambrian.

AB The crustal deformation beneath the Chuan-Dian rhombic block (CDB) and surrounding regions has been studied in geological and geodetic methods, and provide important insights into the kinematics and dynamics about the clockwise movement of this tectonic block. In this work, we present images of the normalized full gradient (NFG) of the Bouguer gravity anomalies from five gravity profiles across the boundary faults of the CDB measured in recent years, and investigate the distribution characteristics of the crustal anomalous bodies along the profiles. Firstly, an anomalous body with eastward dipping exist beneath the Xianshuihe fault, suggesting that crustal mass move to east. Secondly, near the Xiaojiang fault, two anomalous bodies dip westward with depth increasing. The inferred movement direction of the north one is from west to east, and the south one is from east to west. Thirdly, anomalous bodies on the northeast and southwest sides of the Red River fault suggest the directions of crustal movement is from northeast to southwest. These results are also consistent with GPS solutions, and provide gravity evidence for crustal deformation of the CDB with clockwise rotation.

AB The Keketuobie intrusion is situated in the northern part of the West Junggar foldbelt at the southern margin of the Central Asian Orogeic Belt. The intrusion consists of medium-to coarse-grained gabbro, fine-grained gabbro and diorite. Igneous zircons from the medium- to coarse-grained gabbro yielded a LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age of 320.8 +/- 5.7 Ma, indicating that the intrusion was emplaced in the Early Carboniferous. The intrusive contact between the medium- to coarse-grained gabbro and the fine-grained gabbro indicates they formed from distinct magma pulses. Magnetite crystals from the fine-grained gabbro have lower V2O3 but higher TiO2 and Al2O3 contents than those of the medium- to coarse-grained gabbro, suggesting that the fine-grained gabbro crystallized in a relatively higher fO(2) and temperature magma than the medium-to coarse-grained gabbro. The Keketuobie intrusive rocks are characterized by enriched large ion lithophile elements and depleted high field strength elements relative to N-MORB with restricted (Sr-87/Sr-86)t ratios (0.70370-0.70400) and epsilon Nd-(t) values (+ 5.85 to + 6.97). The petrography and geochemistry are comparable to those of subduction-related volcanic rocks. The trace elements and isotopic compositions of the mafic intrusive rocks suggest that the primary magmas were derived from mixing of metasomatized lithospheric mantle and depleted asthenospheric melts, perhaps triggered by slab break-off. The Keketuobie intrusion is younger than adjacent ophiolite sequences, island arc volcanic rocks and porphyry deposits, but predates the post-collisional A-type granites and bimodal volcanic rocks in the district, suggesting that the Keketuobie intrusion likely formed in a syn-collisional setting.

AB The Sartohay ophiolitic melange is located in western Junggar (Xinjiang province, NW China), which is a major component of the core part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Chromian spinels in serpentinite, talc schist, carbonate-talc schist and listwaenite in Sartohay ophiolitic m lange retain primary compositions with Cr# of 0.39-0.65, Mg# = 0.48-0.67, and Fe3+ # < 0.08. Chromian spinels in deformed listwaenite were initially transformed into Fe2+ -rich chromite during shearing deformation followed by Fe3+ -rich chromite at shallow levels. The Cr# and Fe3+# of Fe2+-rich chromite (Cr# = 0.59-0.86, Fe3+# = 0.01-0.12, Mg# = 0.35-0.61) and Fe3+-rich chromite (Cr# = 0.85 L00, Fe3+# = 0.17-0.38, Mg# < 0.29) increase with decrease of Mg#. We propose a model to illustrate the evolution of chromian spinels in highly altered ultramafic rocks from the Sartohay ophiolitic melange. Chromian spinels in serpentinite and talc schist were rimmed by Crmagnetite, which was dissolved completely during transformation from serpentinite/talc schist to listwaenite. Chromian spinels were then transformed into Fe2+ -rich chromite in shear zones, which characterized by high fluid/rock ratios. This Fe2+ -rich chromite and/or chromian spinels could then be transformed into Fe3+ -rich chromite in oxidizing conditions at shallow levels.

AB Cambrian-Ordovician transition was the time of several key events in the history of Central Asia. They were the accretion of Mariana-type island arc systems to the Siberian continent, the related large-scale orogeny and intrusions of basaltic and granitic magma and the formation of a huge turbidite basin commensurate with the Bengal Gulf basin in the western part of the Central Asian orogenic belt (CAOB). The structure of the basin, as well as the sources and environments of deposition remain open to discussion.
   This paper presents new major- and trace-element data on Late-Cambrian-Early Ordovician turbidites from different parts of the Russian Altai and a synthesis of Nd isotope composition and ages of detrital zircons. The turbidites share chemical similarity with material shed from weathered continental arcs. Broad variations of CIA (39-73) and ICV (0.63-1.66) signatures in sandstones suggest origin from diverse sources and absence of significant sorting. Trace elements vary considerably and have generally similar patterns in rocks from different terranes. On the other hand, there are at least two provinces according to Nd isotope composition and age of detrital zircons. Samples from eastern Russian Altai contain only Phanerozoic zircons and have Nd isotope ratios similar to those in Early Cambrian island arcs (epsilon(Nd)t + 4.4... + 5.4; T-Nd(DM)-2-st = 0.8-0.9 Ga). Samples from central, western, and southern parts of Russian Altai contain Precambrian zircons (some as old as Late Archean) and have a less radiogenic Nd composition (epsilon(Nd)t up to -3.6; T-Nd(DM)-2-st up to 1.5 Ga).
   The chemical signatures of Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician turbidites indicate a provenance chemically more mature than the island arc rocks, and the presence of zircons with 510-490 Ma ages disproves their genetic relation with island arcs. The turbidite basin formed simultaneously with peaks of granitic and alkali-basaltic magmatism in the western Central Asian orogen and resulted from interplay of plate tectonic and plume tectonic processes.

AB West Junggar is known to tectonically correlate with East Kazakhstan; however, the tectonic link of the southern West Junggar terrane to adjacent regions still remains uncertain. Here, we examined the oldest accretionary complexes, thus constraining its tectonic evolution and link during the Early-Middle Paleozoic. They have contrasting lithologic, geochemical, and geochronological features and thus, provenances and tectonic settings. The Laba Unit was derived from the Late Ordovician-Early Devonian continental arc system (peaking at 450-420 Ma) with Precambrian substrate, which formed as early as the Early Devonian and metamorphosed during the Permian; however, the Kekeshayi Unit was accumulated in an intra-oceanic arc setting, and includes the pre-Late Silurian and Late Silurian subunits with or without Precambrian sources. Integrated with the regional data, the southern West Junggar terrane revealed a tectonic link to the northern Yili Block during the Late Silurian to Early Devonian, as suggested by the comparable Precambrian zircon age spectra between the southern West Junggar terrane and the micro-continents in the southern Kazakhstan Orocline, the proximal accumulation of the Laba Unit in the continental arc atop the Yili Block, and the sudden appearance of Precambrian zircons in the Kekeshayi Unit during the Late Silurian. This link rejects the proposals of the southern West Junggar terrane as an extension of the northern Kazakhstan Orocline and the Middle Paleozoic amalgamation of West Junggar. A new linking model is thus proposed, in which the southern West Junggar terrane first evolved individually, and then collided with the Yili Block to constitute the Kazakhstan continent during the Late Silurian. The independent and contrasting intra-oceanic and continental arcs also support the Paleozoic archipelago-type evolution of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Heat recovery of marine engine exhaust gas is an effective way of improving the onboard fuel economy and environmental compliance of fishing ships. Among such heat recovery techniques, the absorption refrigeration cycle shows potential as it can convert the exhaust thermal energy into refrigeration output and meet the onboard refrigeration requirement. However, the severe operating conditions on the shipboard poses a great challenge for its application. This paper presents an experimental investigation of an absorption refrigeration system for the heat recovery of marine engine exhaust gas. To overcome the adverse effect of the severe onboard condition on the rectification process of the absorption refrigeration system, a ternary ammonia-water-lithium bromide mixture is selected as the working fluid. A prototype of the absorption system is designed and an experimental investigation is conducted. Then, the performances of both the ternary ammonia-water-lithium bromide-based system and binary ammonia-water-based system are compared. The results show that the rectifier heat exchange area can be reduced by approximately 16% under the experimental working condition. Furthermore, the ternary system operates at a relatively lower pressure, with a refrigeration temperature of less than -15.0 degrees C, which is higher compared to the temperature of less than - 23.6 degrees C associated with the binary system. Nevertheless, the ternary system achieves a remarkably higher cooling capacity. Moreover, by using the ternary ammonia-water-lithium bromide mixture, the heat loss of the prototype is reduced while the coefficient of performance and electric coefficient of performance are increased, indicating that the ternary system has a higher energy conversion efficiency.

AB The development of multigeneration systems is evolving in different directions. One of the main directions is the extended application of the technologies at smaller sizes. Micro-multigeneration solutions aim at becoming competitive at the size of the residential users. The cost of the technologies, in particular the cost of the cogenerator, is a major limitation to the diffusion of micro-multigeneration, especially in countries (e.g., Italy) where residential customers have a limited usage of electricity to supply their facilities. This paper discusses the prospects for the application of micro-multigeneration in Italy. The modelling and analysis of a residential micro-multigeneration system are developed from the energy efficiency and economic assessment viewpoints. The analysis is carried out on a typical system composed of a natural gas internal combustion engine, a small-scale photovoltaic plant, a backup boiler, thermal energy storage and electrical energy storage. A specific analysis tool has been implemented to address the operational planning of this system during a time period of one year. The whole model has been constructed from real data of thermal and electrical demand in a housing complex in Italy. The annual running cost and the primary energy savings occurring to serve the multi-energy demand have been considered in the operational assessment. From an economical viewpoint, the model considers the price of natural gas related to the cogeneration system, the electricity prices and all the tax breaks allowed in Italy. In this way, different scenarios have been constructed and assessed. The results indicate the impact of providing incentives on the purchase cost of the technologies, leading to increase the diffusion of micro-multigeneration solutions for the residential sector in the next years.

AB The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has been demonstrated to be a viable approach to recover low-grade waste heat and has been widely investigated in recent years. In the current research focused on the multi-objective optimization problem of ORC systems, few scholars consider the variation in turbine efficiency with the cycle parameters. This paper focused on the comparison of multi-objective optimization with variable turbine efficiency and that with constant turbine efficiency. The results obtained for the two types of turbine efficiency were compared, and the differences were analyzed. Flue gas at 523.15 K was used as the heat source, and pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, benzene and toluene were selected as working fluid candidates. The one-dimensional radial-inflow turbine efficiency prediction model was applied to replace constant turbine efficiency. The multi-objective model in conjunction with the turbine efficiency model was constructed by defining the net power output and system total cost per unit net power output as the objective functions. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was used to optimize the evaporation temperature and condensation temperature as the decision variables. With the aid of the ideal point, the optimal solution of each working fluid was selected from the Pareto frontier. The results showed that the turbine efficiency varies with changes in evaporation temperature and condensation temperature. In the multi-optimization with constant turbine efficiency, toluene and cyclohexane are the optimal working fluids, whereas with variable turbine efficiency, benzene is the optimal working fluid. In the sensitivity analysis, the optimal exergy efficiency shows opposite trends for the multi-objective optimization with constant and variable turbine efficiency.

AB Waste plastic in municipal solid wastes degrade very slowly over several years and poses a serious challenge for sustainable environment. Hydrocarbons embodied in waste plastic could be converted into liquid fuel. Recycling waste plastic oil (WPO) in diesel engines offers a sustainable solution for ecological safety and energy security. However WPO produces carcinogenic smoke emissions in diesel engines that have to be controlled. This study attempts to minimize these emissions with the aid of oxygenated three high-carbon alcohols and also provides a comparative analysis on the effects of their addition to WPO individually on emissions and performance of a single cylinder diesel engine. A response surface methodology (RSM) based optimization using a 3-factor x 3-level full factorial experimental design was employed to find the optimum combination of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), injection timing and alcohol with an objective to minimize NOx and smoke emissions with minimum BSFC. Three injection timings (21 degrees, 23 degrees and 25 degrees CA bTDC) and three EGR rates (10, 20 and 30%) were used. Multiple regression models developed using RSM for NOx, smoke density and BSFC were found to be statistically significant. Interactive effects between injection timing and EGR on responses for all blends were compared. From desirability approach, WPO70P30 injected at 21 degrees CA bTDC with 10% EGR delivered optimum emission and performance characteristics with a maximum desirability of 0.968. Pentanol was found to be the best among n-hexanol and n-octanol for this purpose. Confirmatory tests validated the models to be adequate with an error in prediction within 6%. With reference to diesel, n-pentanol with WPO injected at 21 degrees CA bTDC with 10% EGR reduced smoke emissions by 76.8% and increased NOx emissions by 32% with an improvement in BSFC by 17.8%. With respect to neat WPO, the same blend reduced smoke emissions by 74.2% and increased NOx emissions by 9.7% with an improvement in BSFC by 3.2%.

AB Solar organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has advantages over common PV systems in view of the flexible operation even if solar radiation is unavailable. However, at present the dynamic performance of solar ORC with respect to the off-design behaviour of storage unit, expander, pump and heat exchanger is rarely reported. This paper investigates a medium-temperature solar ORC system characterized by evacuated flat-plate collectors and pressurised water storage unit. The main aim of the study is to investigate the performance of the system with consideration of transient behaviour of the thermal storage unit which results in off-design operation of other components. The other aim is adjusting the power output according to electricity demand throughout a day. The heat storage unit is analysed using one-dimensional temperature distribution model. A transient simulation model is developed including pump and expander models. To meet the electrical demands of different periods, the mass flow rate of heat source is adjusted for controlling the evaporation temperature. Moreover, sliding pressure operation control strategy of the ORC is implemented to meet variable heat source temperature. A 550 m 2 solar collector area and a 4 m diameter and 7 m height pressurized water cylinder are used in simulation. Produced work is controlled and the results are matched with the demands. Produced work from the expander under the given conditions are 47.11 kWh in day time, 70.97 kWh in peak period and 31.59 kWh after midnight.

AB In this paper, the idea of using flameless combustion in a hybrid solar combustion system is investigated by modeling and thermodynamically analyzing a gas turbine system. In this regard, a gas turbine system coupling with hybrid solar flameless combustion including heliostat solar field, central receiver, flameless combustor and power generation system are modeled. In conditions that sun power is not adequate to heat up the combustion air over auto-ignition temperature of the fuel, air is passed through the first stage combustor. To provide a basic cycle for comparison, a common gas turbine with preheater is modeled as well. Energy and exergitic-based analyses of various systems are evaluated and environmental footprints reduction of proposed optimum cycle is assessed and compared to the basic case. The results illustrate that Nitrogen Oxides formation in hybrid solar flameless combustion is significantly lower than common gas turbine system. While the gas turbine with preheater generates 67 mu g Nitrogen Oxides per kWh, hybrid solar combustion system produces less than 7 mu g Nitrogen Oxides per kWh. In comparison to gas turbine system, fuel consumption decreases in hybrid solar flameless combustion system from 0.1875 kg/s to 0.16 kg/s (about 14.7%) when solar share is considered just 40%. Since the inlet air of flameless combustor is charged from solar heater outlet, increasing air temperature enhances the share of solar energy in the system which results in overall energy reduction in the system. The proposed system shows significant environmental benefits and based on the available technologies, it is suitable for high temperature solar towers.

AB In support of more efficient utilization of solar and nuclear energy in power generation, the present work proposes a conceptual design of a hybrid nuclear-solar power system (HNSPS) for on-demand power supply, based on a parallel thermal integration of small modular reactors with commercialized molten-salt concentrating solar power tower plants. A cost-effective thermal energy storage system is employed as a thermal coupling and a heat dispatcher to coordinate both nuclear heat and solar heat with power demands. The overall configuration and operation strategy of the hybrid system are elaborated. A numerical model of the hybrid system is developed based on the circulation of molten-salt. Using the model, a 7-day performance analysis of the hybrid system with different considerations are conducted. Effects of key design parameters on system performances are investigated by a parametric study. A customized evaluation parameter, named as "design score", is defined to assess the suitability of the designed configurations. The performance analysis shows that the integration of nuclear power with concentrating solar power allows the system to be less dependent on heat dispatch to achieve required power regulations, comparing to a standalone CSP plant with an equivalent power capacity. The parametric study indicates that a higher heat generation utilization of the hybrid system requires a larger TES and a smaller heliostats field, while a higher power supply efficiency of the hybrid system is accompanied with a larger TES, a larger heliostats field, and a higher nuclear power capacity proportion. The optimum design configuration of a 200 MWe HNSPS is estimated to have a nuclear power capacity proportion of 50%, a theoretical thermal energy storage duration of 14.8 h, and a heliostats field with a solar multiple of 1.27. This configuration can completely satisfy the power demand without any heat generation curtailment during the 7-day operation. The obtained results allow the HNSPS to be considered as a promising non-carbon-emitting power generation system for on-demand power supply.

AB Thermochemical energy storage has the potential to provide efficient, compact and long duration storage of thermal energy. Major advancements, however, are needed for such a technology to meet performance and cost targets. Here we present a study on novel composites for low to medium temperature thermochemical energy storage (< 150 degrees C) with an aim to maximize energy density and to understand the associated mass and heat transport phenomena. The composites were made of strontium bromide hexahydrate and natural graphite with the latter acting as a supporting matrix. We used a simple manufacturing method to fabricate the composites and experimentally characterized the performance of the materials using various methods including thermo-gravimetry, laser flash analysis and dynamic vapor sorption. The results showed that the composites achieved an energy density above 600 kJ/kg with the storage process occurring mostly below similar to 100 degrees C - a promising feature for domestic applications. The results also showed that the natural graphite could improve the hydration-dehydration kinetics by reducing hysteresis and a fourfold increase in the thermal conductivity could be achieved with 20% of natural graphite in the composite.

AB In the current work, the melting process, heat transfer, and energy storage characteristics of a bio-based nano-PCM in a vertical Cylindrical Thermal Energy Storage (C-TES) system are numerically investigated and verified with experimental work. Mathematical models based on non-linear differential equations are developed to study the mass, momentum, and energy transport processes inside the C-TES system. The effects of nanoparticles volume fraction (i.e. phi = 0%, 3%, and 5%) and Rayleigh number (i.e. Ra-nl = 10(6), 10(7), and 10(8)) on the melting process are investigated. To compare the numerical results, an experimental setup is developed and transient images are captured to identify the location and shape of solid-liquid interface. To prepare nano-PCM, the copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles are dispersed into the bio-based coconut oil PCM. The C-TES system is insulated from the bottom, isothermally heated from its lateral walls and the top. Numerically obtained solid-liquid interface locations and melt fractions for base PCM and nano-PCM are compared with experimental analysis and a very good agreement is obtained. The numerical results are further compared with existing numerical and experimental results available in the literature. The work then explains the effects of Rayleigh number and volume fraction of nanoparticles on melt fraction, Nusselt number, and stored energy. The results indicate that adding nanoparticles do not change the patterns of melt fraction, Nusselt number, and energy storage capacity with time compared to the base PCM case. The effects of specific heat capacity of solid nano-PCM, liquid nano-PCM, and latent heat capacity of nano-PCM on energy stored are discussed. The results show that the difference in energy stored with Rayleigh number is less during the beginning of the melting; as melting reaches in the convection dominated regime, a larger difference is observed due to increased melting at larger Rayleigh number.

AB The ever-increasing demand for more efficient energy conversion has placed designers under increasing pressure to develop processing equipment that can meet contemporary needs. It has long been known that a decreasing Reynolds number has a negative effect on centrifugal compressor efficiency. The drop in efficiency can be accounted for relatively easily in the design process using various empirical correlations. However, the correlations only account for a reduction in performance; they do not offer any consideration of the extent to how the drop in efficiency can be countered in the design process. To identify potential methods by which it is possible to improve the performance of centrifugal compressors operating at low Reynolds numbers, the loss development in centrifugal compressors with a reducing Reynolds number must be studied. Recent works on loss development, in general, have focused on the overall performance deterioration, and the differentiation of the losses originating from different causes with the reducing Reynolds number has been studied only in an axial compressor. The present paper examines loss development in a centrifugal compressor with a vaneless diffuser with respect to the Reynolds number and differentiates between the losses that originate from different causes. A new hybrid method is used to calculate the boundary layer thickness inside a complex flow field. The results show that the diffuser plays a significant role in the performance deterioration of centrifugal compressors with a low Reynolds number and should be included in the loss development analysis. A study of the boundary layers, flow fields and loss development indicates that growth in the impeller hub and diffuser boundary layers should be reduced to improve the performance of the compressor.

AB With the combination of molecular simulation and relevant experiments, the efficient Bronsted-Lewis acidic ionic liquid (IL) was designed and synthesized for biodiesel production from soapberry oil. In molecular simulation, 4-methylthiazole (MT) is proved to be the best matrix for IL preparation via electrostatic potential analysis and proton affinity analysis, and it also is verified by experiments. In orthogonal experiment, the relationship in catalytic activity between Bronsted-Lewis acidic IL and corresponding materials (Bronsted acidic IL and metal chloride) was revealed. Meanwhile, [Ps-MTH] [CF3SO3] and FeCl3 are verified as the best materials for preparation of Bronsted-Lewis acidic IL, and [Ps-MTH] [CF3SO3]-FeCl3 (x = 0.65) is determined as the most efficient catalyst in the end. The Lewis acidity, Bronsted acidity and interaction of [Ps-MTH] [CF3SO3] and FeCl3 in [Ps-MTH] [CF3SO3]-FeCl3 (x = 0.65) were characterized by FT-IR. And the catalytic mechanism of transesterification catalyzed by prepared IL was clarified. In order to maximize the biodiesel yield, optimization of process variables was conducted using Box-Behnken response surface methodology. The 97.04% of high biodiesel yield is obtained under the optimum conditions: reaction temperature was 127 degrees C, molar ratio (methanol to soapberry oil) was 27.96:1, catalyst amount was 3.06 mmol and reaction time was 8 h. Furthermore, [Ps-MTH] [CF3SO3]-FeCl3(x = 0.65) presents good catalytic activity in different transesterification for biodiesel production. And its catalytic activity decreases from 97.04% to 93.59% after being used for 5 times, which reflects good reusability. The main properties of soapberry biodiesel were also measured and compared to the ASTM D6751 standard.

AB In this work, the optimization of a low temperature, water-in-glass, evacuated tubes solar collector is presented. The process of optimization combined the simulated annealing method and a computational fluid dynamics model. The numerical study was carried out in three dimensions, steady-state and laminar regime. A design of experiments study via computational fluid dynamics was carried out with two levels and five parameters, 2(5), the parameters with significance in the performance of the collector were found from a commercial collector. This collector was used as base case in the process of optimization. In the optimization process, the absorber area was analyzed under three different cases because of the combination of geometrical parameters: length, diameter and number of tubes. Thus, 259 different collector geometries were constructed and modeled. Results from the design of experiments showed that the significant parameters on the thermal performance of the solar collector are: the diameter of the tubes, the absorber area, and the mass flow rate. Results of the optimization process showed that the minimum absorber area for an optimal geometry is 2.49 m(2), which is 19.4% lower than the commercial geometry considering the same outlet temperature. The diameter of the tubes increased around 30%, the length of the tubes decreased 40%, the cost of the optimal geometry and the number of evacuated tubes decreased 38.9% and the thermal efficiency increased 26.3%, compared to the commercial geometry. The results of this work can be helpful in further specific applications where the maximum performance and the minimum costs are important, such as: the design of low temperature, water-in-glass, evacuated tubes solar collector networks for heating water in swimming pools, buildings, hospitals and industries.

AB The present paper aims to evaluate the performance of a solar district cooling system in typical Middle East climate conditions. A centralized cooling station is supposed to distribute chilled water for a residential compound through a piping network. Two different solar cooling technologies are compared: two-stage lithium-bromide absorption chiller (2sABS) driven by Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTCs) vs. single-stage lithium-bromide absorption chiller (1sABS) fed by Evacuated Tube Collectors (ETCs). A computer code has been developed in Trnsys (R) (the transient simulation software developed by the University of Wisconsin) to simulate on hourly basis the annual operation of the solar cooling system, including building thermal load calculation, thermal losses in pipes and control strategy of the energy storage. A solar fraction of 70% was considered to size the solar field aperture area and the chiller capacity, within a multi-variable optimization process. An auxiliary compression chiller is supposed to cover the peak loads and to be used as backup unit. The two different solar cooling plants exhibit strongly different performance. For each plant configuration, the model determined the optimal size of every component leading to the primary cost minimization. The solar district cooling configuration based on 2sABS and PTCs shows higher performance at Riyadh (KSA) climate conditions and the overall cost is 30% lower than the one of the single-stage absorption chiller plant.

AB Hydrogen obtained from water electrolysis in addition to being sustainable becomes commercially competitive when a high degree of purity is sought. Ideally such purity is achieved by keeping the electrolyzer on a constant and rated power. To satisfy this objective the assistance of the electric grid to deal with the variability of the wind resource was proposed. The disadvantage of this alternative is the failure to ensure a 100% carbon-emission-free hydrogen. The surplus wind energy can be delivered to the grid to optimize the trade-off between purity and cleaning degree. This paper presents a study on how the electrolyzer should be sized - according to the turbine and wind resource - to fully compensate these emissions along the year, that is, to cancel the annual power supplied by the grid.

To validating the existence of the optimal medium temperature, the system performances were studied: the system power dissipation declined, while the heating capacity increased first and then decreased with the augment in medium temperature. To search the reason of the optimal medium temperature, the system parameters of both the refrigerant side and water side were also discussed in detail: the varied trend of the parameters were sophisticated with the change in medium temperature. Additionally, a correlation was established to predict the optimal value of the medium temperature under various conditions with the ambient temperature, water return temperature and water delivery temperature as the independent variables.

AB The thermal performance of compressor-assisted double-effect absorption refrigeration (CDAR) was numerically investigated and comprehensively analyzed with 1, 3-dimethylimidazolylium dimethylphosphate/methanol ([mmim]DMP/CH3OH) as working fluid. The CDAR system was modeled and simulated based on the proposed mathematical model of the compression process by considering the mass and energy conservation of each component. The effects of compression ratio and heat source temperature on the system's operating state, including solution temperature, refrigeration concentration, mass flow, and heat load of each component, were calculated and discussed. Variations in the coefficient of performance and exergy efficiency in four cases were simulated and compared. Results suggested that placing the assisting compressor between the evaporator and absorber was a good option, and placing the assisting compressor between two generators was also acceptable. The exergy losses of each component were calculated and compared. The largest exergy loss occurred in the low-temperature generator and accounted for approximately one-third of the total exergy input. The main reason for the exergy loss in the diffusion absorption refrigeration system was heat transfer with a temperature difference.

AB A novel solar thermal storage heating equipment that is integrated with several highly efficient solar collecting heat storage units (HSU) that filled with phase-change material (PCM) and combined with finned heat pipe to enhance the heat dissipation process was developed and experimentally studied. Due to its advantages such as compactness, easy integrity, intelligent operation, rapid heat storage and dissipation rates, and higher overall utilization efficiency, it may has extensive applications in near future in green heating of residential or commercial buildings, agricultural greenhouse heating, drying and other temperature control system. The solar radiation intensity, elevation angle of the equipment, ambient air temperature and flow-rate were considered experimentally as operating parameters. And the characteristics of the temperature distribution in different sections of the PCM in the HSUs were analyzed. The heat storage performance was studied at different solar radiation flux and elevation angle and the heat dissipation performance was conducted by changing ambient air temperatures and convective velocities. Experimental results showed that the optimum elevation angle of the apparatus was 60 degrees (when used in July/August in the western part of Inner Mongolia). The more extensive the solar radiation, the higher heat storage capacity and rate of the STHSE were achieved. Higher ambient air velocity and lower temperature could significantly improve the overall heat dissipation performance and efficiency. At ambient air temperature of 18 degrees C and velocity of 6.0 m/s through the wind tunnel, the overall heat dissipation rate reached 414 W and the overall efficiency of heat dissipation was obtained as high as 97%.

AB In CNG/Diesel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engines, because of low reactivity fuel (natural gas) spread of flame in combustion chamber suffers process of combustion and also there is more unburned hydrocarbon emission in this type of engine due to flame spread, free-combustion points, penetrating gas into rings and cavities. Using hydrogen as an additive can improve combustion process, improve engine performance and reduce emissions. By this research, a computational fluid dynamic modeling in coupling with Chemkin solver has been used to investigate the effects of hydrogen as an additive in RCCI CNG/Diesel internal combustion engine. Numerical results have been validated by a single cylinder Ricardo E6/MS engine that equipped by a standard Comet MK.V pre-chamber. Three different concentrations (10%, 20% and 30% in volume) of hydrogen have been studied by this modeling. Specification of Ricardo engine have been used for CFD modeling from IVC to EVO as a close system modeling. There is a good flow structure with good swirling flow before combustion that makes fuel more suitable for starting combustion. HRR diagrams show a delay in combustion by adding hydrogen in natural gas and air. IMEP, gross work and IFCE improved by 5.01%, 5.01% and 5.04% in concentration of 30% hydrogen, respectively. There are a descend in mass fraction of UHC and CO in different hydrogen concentration that 30% H-2 addition in fuel makes the amount of UHC and CO lower by 29.8% and 35.5%, correspondingly. This is in a condition that in-cylinder temperature rises about 2.9% by 30% of hydrogen adding. NOx emissions has been risen during adding H-2 because of increasing temperature, this increment is about 23.1% at 30% hydrogen that can be an undesired effect of using H-2 as an additive. In general, the simultaneous use of Pre-chamber and hydrogen has been able to reduce the amount of CO and UHC, but the amount of nitrogen oxide has been increased.

AB Renewable energy (RE) penetration growth without energy storage system (ESS) is restricted due to its poor dispatchability. Compressed air energy storage system (CAES) is one of the promising ESS technologies. But, low energy density and high mechanical inertia confined its application as a bulk ESS. In this paper, a novel hybrid thermal-compressed supercritical carbon dioxide energy storage (T-CCES) system is proposed to address CAES shortcomings. In this system, a stratified water thermal energy storage (TES) is employed to store both released heat of compression process and high-frequency reluctant power of a wind farm (which cannot be followed by CCES) using electrical heaters. A dynamic simulation is performed to evaluate system characteristics in steady wind generation condition and in a real wind generation condition. Stochastic simulation of the proposed system integrated with a real wind farm is also fulfilled to assess its characteristics and performance by considering uncertainties using sparse polynomial chaos expansion. Additionally, global sensitivity analysis via Sobol' indices is conducted to identify the most important parameters of the system. Results show that the system can store wind power during off-peak hours and smoothly releases it into the grid with 57.55% round-trip efficiency (RTE) and 84.1 kWh/m(3) energy density. Uncertainty quantification results indicate that the system can properly work under uncertainties with standard deviation of 55.72-58.16% RTE and 83.7-86.5 kWh/m(3) energy density. Moreover, results show that the random production of wind turbine has a negligible effect on performance characteristics of the T-CCES which makes it a promising solution for integration with wind farms.

AB The thermal performance in various orientations of gravity was investigated for operating multi-branch heat pipes (MBHPs) with different sintered wicks in the case of cooling a heat source with dual condenser. The effect of sintered particle size in different orientations on heat transfer performance were investigated systematically. The particle size effect was examined with three copper powders of particle size of 50-75 mu m, 75-100 mu m and 100-125 mu m in four orientations of gravity-assisted orientation, anti-gravity orientation, horizontal orientation, and compound orientation of gravity, respectively. All MBHPs were filled by deionized water to the filling ratio of 100%. Experiment results indicate that all MBHPs can operate with similar performance in all the tested orientations before dry-out occurring. Further, the MBHP with 75-100 mu m copper powder performs best in all the tested orientations, considering both the thermal resistance and the heat transport capability. In addition, it can start up successfully within 10 min without temperature overshoot and oscillation. That is, a MBHP can perform well in all the tested orientations and the copper powder of 75-100 mu m is a good candidate for better thermal performance.

AB This article identifies the sources and determines the convergence and causes of energy efficiency in Africa. In terms of contribution, it provides the first cross-country evidence. This study applies the stochastic fixed effect, true fixed effect and the Kumbhakar-Heshmati (K-H) models using a panel data of 22 countries for the period 1988-2014. The result reveals that: (1) the problem of energy efficiency in Africa is more structural in nature. Removing transient inefficiency and minimizing persistent inefficiency will save 5.7% and 84% of total energy consumption, respectively. Thus, energy security and carbon emissions will benefit more from policies aimed at the long-term than the short-term; (2) overall energy efficiency is low and hyoid in nature. While it declined from 1988 to 2006, the trend has reversed after 2006; (3) economic growth, urbanization and population density promote efficiency but price, foreign direct inflows and service and industry output reduce it; (4) energy efficiency convergence is conditional in nature, driven by country-specific factors such as the level of technology; (5) energy intensity is not a good measure of energy efficiency and should not be used as a policy indicator for energy efficiency enhancement.

AB Recycling of municipal mixed plastic waste (MPW) is an emerging technology for conversion of waste to wealth. In the current study, MPW was processed to produce plasto-oils (PO1 and PO2) by thermochemical depolymerization in a batch production of 0.5 ton/batch. These oils were used in a 3.7 kW rated power single cylinder direct injection compression ignition (CI) engine to assess performance, combustion and emission behavior of the engine. The experimental results with plasto-oils were compared with base diesel fuel operation at different brake mean effective pressures (BMEPs) of 1.8, 3.8, 5.8, 7.8 and 10.8 bar. It is explored that brake thermal efficiency of the test engine with plasto-oils was almost comparable with the diesel fuel at all engine loads. Carbon based emissions such as unburnt hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and smoke emissions from the engine at 3.8-10.8 bar BMEPs were slightly higher with plasto-oils than diesel fuel. Nitrogen oxides emission decreased faintly with the use of plasto-oils at medium and high BMEPs (5.8-10.8 bar). However, at lower BMEPs (1.8-3.8 bar), emission behavior of the engine (HC, CO, smoke and NOx emissions) was same with all kinds of fuels (diesel, PO1 and PO2). Overall, it is ascertained from the study that the plasto-oils exhibited a comparable performance with the conventional diesel fuel, which further promises its viability to use as a fuel candidate for CI engines.

AB In this article, an active solar distiller is designed and implemented. The distiller consists of a Fresnel lens concentrator with an auxiliary photovoltaic energy collector, which supplies an electrical water preheating process. The light concentrator and the photovoltaic system are oriented through a three-degree-of-freedom robotic system, achieving the sun tracking and focus tasks of the concentration process. The design uses concurrent engineering tools to improve the general behavior of the system for energy collection and water distillation. This approach demands some different analyses such as optical, structural, thermal, and dynamic, modeling, which yield to the main design. The system is validated through different tests concerning the energy collection process and the resulting water quality, leading to an energetically autonomous effective system that can provide an alternative distillation process.

AB The purpose of this work is to record the baseline performance of a state-of-the-art micro-combined heat and power (mCHP) system. A second goal of this work is to provide detailed thermodynamic first and second law performance measurements of the internal combustion engine and generator subsystems. A global technology survey was conducted to identify the leading mCHP systems in the 1 kW electric range. The Honda ECOWILL was identified as the state-of-the-art system in the United States, and an unused unit was procured. The ECOWILL underwent round-robin performance testing at three independent laboratories. First law (energy) and second law (exergy) analyses were conducted on the steady state data. Analysis revealed the ECOWILL operated at a first law electrical efficiency of 23.5 +/- 0.4% and a utilization factor of 74.5 +/- 3.2%. The primary energy loss was heat transfer from the device, followed by chemical and thermal energy in the exhaust stack. The second law analysis showed the ECOWILL operated at a second law electrical efficiency of 23.1 +/- 0.4% and total (including exergy in both the electrical and recovered waste heat streams) second law efficiency of 30.2 +/- 2.3%. Key areas of exergy destruction were, in decreasing magnitude, heat transfer, combustion irreversibility, and generator and friction losses.

AB The present experimental study aims at investigating the impact of adding graphene oxide nanoparticles (GO) to neat Jatropha Methyl Ester (JME) on a single cylinder air cooled direct injection four stroke diesel engine. The nano-fuels have been prepared from 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/l concentrations of graphene oxide with neat Jatropha biodiesel through ultrasonication process. The graphene oxide nanoparticles crystallite size, morphology, and the chemical structures were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. The compression ignition engine characteristics were investigated by the four JME-GO blends, and their results were compared with neat JME under various engine loads at a constant engine speed of 2000 rpm. The results indicate that the diesel engine operated by JME-GO nano-fuels enhanced the brake thermal efficiency by 17% compared to neat JME fuel. Furthermore, the peak cylinder pressure, the highest rate of pressure rise, and maximum heat release rate were also increased by 8%, 6%, and 6%, respectively. The CO and UHC emissions were decreased significantly by 60% and 50%, respectively, for JME-GO blends compared to pure JME fuel. At high engine load, the NOx emission was reduced by 15% for JME-GO blends compared to pure Jatropha biodiesel. The results also illustrated that the concentration of 50 mg/L had the optimum improvement in the overall characteristics of engine performance and emissions.

AB Italy is celebrated in the world for its agri-food industries while the process of production of pasta is highly energy demanding and requires both electrical and thermal energy simultaneously. Because most of the Italian factories producing pasta are located in the Southern part of the country, the direct use of thermal energy generated from the sun would be particularly profitable. In this study, the authors examine the possibility of generating by a Solar Industrial Process Heating plant the thermal energy required annually by an existing factory that produces durum wheat pasta located in Sicily (Italy). The hypothesized plant scheme consists of an array of Fresnel linear solar collectors and a concrete thermal energy storage system in which a heat transfer diathermal fluid circulates. This particular combination, although not the most efficient from the thermodynamic point of view, determines a lower visual impact and easier maintenance during the life span of the system. The use of food graded thermal oil ensures a high level of safety. A TRNSYS model has been developed in order to simulate the energy performance of the above described plant with the aim of optimizing the design of the solar heat for industrial process systems in terms of solar collectors and thermal energy storage dimensions taking into account the available space in the specific location. The obtained results show that the direct use of the thermal energy generated with the Fresnel solar collectors can significantly contribute to increase the sustainability of the most thermal energy-demanding factories working in the food industry, a strategic sector in the Mediterranean Area. The average annual solar contribution can reach about 40% of the total thermal energy requirement, maximizing the solar energy production during the summer season. Moreover, the proposed study allowed the determination of the maximum investment cost of the plant linked to a simple payback time, without external incentives, of 8 years.

AB Stable TiO2-H2O nanofluids are prepared and their stabilities are studied. An experimental set for studying the heat transfer and flow characteristics of nanofluids is established. Heat transfer and flow characteristics of TiO2-H2O nanofluids in a circular tube with rotating and static built-in twisted tapes are experimentally investigated and compared. An innovative performance evaluation plot of exergy efficiency is developed and the exergy efficiency of tube with rotating and static built-in twisted tapes filled with nanofluids is analyzed in this paper. The results indicate that the combination of rotating built-in twisted tape and TiO2-H2O nanofluids shows an excellent enhancement in heat transfer, which can increase the heat transfer by 101.6% compared with that of in a circular tube. The effects of nanoparticle mass fractions (omega = 0.1%, 0.3% and 0.5%) and Reynolds numbers (Re = 600-7000) on the heat transfer and flow characteristics of TiO2-H2O nanofluids are discussed. It is found that there is a critical Reynolds number (Re = 4500) for the maximum value of relative heat transfer enhancement ratio. The comprehensive performance of the experimental system is analyzed. It can be found that the comprehensive performance index of the experimental system firstly increases and then reduces with Reynolds number, and it can reach 1.519 at best. However, for the performance evaluation of exergy efficiency, the coupling of rotating twisted tape and nanofluids deteriorates the exergy efficiency. Also, it can be found that the exergy efficiency of the circular tube with twisted tape is greater than that of circular tube under the same pumping power and pressure drop, but it shows deterioration under the same mass flow rate.

AB The dual-loop organic Rankine cycle (DORC) is a promising technology for internal combustion engine waste heat recovery. Zeotropic mixtures can improve temperature matches with heat source and sink in the phase change process for its non-isothermal phase change characteristic. Thus, zeotropic mixtures are adopted for high-temperature loop (HTL) and low-temperature loop (LTL) of DORC. Cyclopentane/cyclohexane and benzene/ toluene mixtures are used for HTL, whereas isobutane/isopentane (R600a/R601a) mixtures are selected as working fluids for LTL. The mole fraction effects of mixtures on net power output, energy efficiency, energy destruction rate (HTL evaporator, condenser/evaporator, LTL preheater, and condenser), and heat utilization ratio of waste heat are analyzed. The influences of engine exhaust gas temperature on net power output and energy destruction rate are also discussed. Results show that the use of mixtures for the two loops can reduce the energy destruction rate of HTL evaporator and LTL condenser compared to that of pure working fluids system and the energy destruction rate of condenser/evaporator compared to that of mixtures using only one loop system. Furthermore, these mixtures increase the heat utilization ratio of waste heat, net power output, and energy efficiency compared to those of a pure working fluid system. When cyclopentane/cyclohexane or benzene/toluene mixtures are used for HTL and R600a/R601a mixtures are used for LTL, the system net power output relative increment rates of mixture systems are 2.5-9.0% and 1.4-4.3%, respectively, compared to those of corresponding pure working fluids system with 573.15-623.15 K engine exhaust gas temperature.

AB The waste heat from exhaust gases and cooling water of Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition are used to launch a two-stage Organic Rankine Cycle. Considering the chemical kinetic mechanism, a Computational Fluid Dynamic model is presented to simulate the gasoline-diesel fueled RCCI engine. In addition, the performance of ORC is simulated by applying the Engineering Equation Solver software. By linking these two codes, a detailed Computational Fluid Dynamic-thermo analysis is carried out for the proposed heat recovery system and also the potential effects of some decision parameters on the performances of the combined Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition - Organic Rankine Cycle system are studied in detail. The obtained results show that coupling Organic Rankine Cycle to the engine, improves Fuel Conversion Efficiency, break specific of Oxides of Nitrogen and Carbon Monoxide emissions as well as exergy efficiency to compare with sole engine operation state. According to the parametric analysis, can be seen that the temperature and pinch point differences of the evaporators, expanders' efficiencies as well as the temperatures and mass flow rates of the engine exhausted gases and cooling water should be taken as the effective parameters to evaluate the proposed system in terms of the first and second laws of thermodynamic. Moreover, a comparative study is performed between Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition engine and a conventional diesel engine as the heat source of the heat recovery system. Results indicate that the energy and exergy efficiencies of Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition - Organic Rankine Cycle system are higher than diesel - ORC under the same operations load, although, using a diesel engine has a greater influence on the net output power of the attached cycle, regardless of the engines' power.

AB This paper proposes a new hydraulic excavator boom driving system using novel asymmetric pump to reduce energy consumption. Due to large throttling loss and gravitational potential wasting, conventional hydraulic excavator boom driving system has very low energy efficiency. This paper aims to improve the energy efficiency of the hydraulic excavator by reducing throttling loss and regenerating potential energy directly based on a novel pump controlled system. The system under consideration utilizes a novel asymmetric pump which has three ports, of which two are connected to the hydraulic cylinder, and the other one is connected to an accumulator. Thus, this system can regenerate the potential energy directly and can basically match the unequal flow rates of the single rod cylinder. The structure and working principle of the asymmetric pump controlled single rod cylinder system are studied in depth in this paper. To better demonstrate the performance of the proposed system, the popular independent metering circuit, which has been proposed to improve the efficiency of boom system, is used as a comparison. Moreover, experimental results of the two systems have been obtained based on a real 6-ton hydraulic excavator. The boom driving system of the excavator was first modified to the independent metering circuit to conduct experiment, and afterwards was modified to the proposed system. Experimental results show that, about 82.7% of the potential energy could be regenerated and reutilized by the proposed system. Compared with the independent metering circuit, the electric power consumption of the boom system during moving-up operation can be reduced by 76.1%. Furthermore, if the energy efficiency of the power source is considered, the energy consumption during the entire boom cylinder working cycle can be reduced by 75.0%. Finally, it is worth noting that the proposed system can be applied in all kinds of heavy-duty construction machineries, though only hydraulic excavator is experimented.

AB Computational evaluation of three design modifications of a membraneless microfluidic fuel cell (MMFC), i.e., inlets located midway along the microchannel, multiple compartments in the channel cross section, and a multi-stream (oxidant-fuel-oxidant) configuration, is performed in this work. The first two modifications are novel concepts proposed in this work. These adjustments to the microchannel are introduced to decrease the negative effects caused by the increased channel length, width, and height on the performance of MMFCs. Formic acid and oxygen are dissolved in sulfuric acid solution as the fuel and oxidant, respectively. Simulations are executed by employing three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and mass transport equation for the analyses of flow and species concentration. The electro-chemical reaction is modeled using Butler-Volmer equations. Based on the study that investigated the inlet location, inlets placed at the center of the microchannel are shown to be the best option among the selected inlet positions. Additionally, the multi-compartment configuration enhances the current density by as much as three times compared to a simple square microchannel.

ID VARIABILITY
AB Snake venoms are a mixture of different molecules that can be used in the design of drugs for various diseases. The study of these venoms has relied on strategies that use complete venom extracted from animals in captivity or from venom glands that require the sacrifice of the animals. Colombia, a country with political and geographical conflicts has difficult access to certain regions. A strategy that can prevent the sacrifice of animals and could allow the study of samples collected in the field is necessary. We report the use of lyophilized venom from Crotalus durissus cumanensis as a model to test, for the first time, a protocol for the amplification of complete toxins from Colombian venom samples collected in the field. In this protocol, primers were designed from conserved region from Crotalus sp. mRNA and EST regions to maximize the likelihood of coding sequence amplification. We obtained the sequences of Metalloproteinases II, Disintegrins, Disintegrin-Like, Phospholipases A(2), C-type Lectins and Serine proteinases from Crotalus durissus cumanensis and compared them to different Crotalus sp sequences available on databases obtaining concordance between the toxins amplified and those reported. Our strategy allows the use of lyophilized venom to obtain complete toxin sequences from samples collected in the field and the study of poorly characterized venoms in challenging environments.

AB The assessment of the capacity of antivenoms to neutralize the lethal activity of snake venoms still relies on traditional rodent in vivo lethality assay. ED50 and LD50 assays require large quantities of venoms and antivenoms, and besides leading to animal suffering. Therefore, in vitro tests should be introduced for assessing antivenom neutralizing capacity in intermediary steps of antivenom production. This task is facilitated when one key lethal toxin is identified. A good example is crotoxin, a P-neurotoxin phospholipase A(2)-like toxin that presents anticoagulant activity in vitro and is responsible for the lethality of venoms of Crotalus durissus snakes. By using rotational thromboelastometry, we reported recently one sensitive coagulation assay for assessing relative potency of the anti-bothropic serum in neutralizing procoagulant activity of Bothrops jararaca venom upon recalcified factor-XII-deficient chicken plasma samples (CPS). In this study, we stablished conditions for determining relative potency of four batches of the anti-crotalic serum (ACS) (antagonist) in inactivating crotoxin anticoagulant activity in CPS (target) simultaneously treated with one classical activator of coagulation (agonists). The correlation coefficient (r) between values related the ACS potency in inactivating both in vitro crotoxin anticoagulant activity and the in vivo lethality of whole venom (ED50) was 0.94 (p value < 0.05). In conclusion, slowness in spontaneous thrombin/fibrin generation even after recalcification elicit time lapse sufficient for elaboration of one dose-response curve to pro-or anti-coagulant agonists in CPS. We propose this methodology as an alternative and sensitive assay for assessing antivenom neutralizing ability in plasma of immunized horses as well as for in-process quality control.

AB Actinoporins are pore-forming proteins found in sea anemones. Although we now have a large collection of data on actinoporins, our knowledge is based heavily on those identified in shallow-water anemones. Because the deep sea differs considerably from shallow waters in hydrostatic pressures, temperatures, and the prey composition, the deep-sea actinoporin may have evolved in unique ways. This study, therefore, aimed to obtain new actinoporins in the deep-sea anemone Cribrinopis japonica (Actiniaria, Actiniidae). An actinoporin-like sequence was identified from the previously established C. japonica RNASeq database, and the complete length (663 bp) of the deep-sea actinoporin gene, Cjtox 1, was obtained. In addition, a similar gene, Cjtox 11 (666 bp), was also identified from RNA of actinopharynx. CJTOX I and CJTOX II were similar in their primary structures, but CJTOX I lacked one residue in the middle of the protein. There was also a difference in the gene expression in live animals, where only Cjtox I was expressed in tentacles of C. japonica. In the heterologous expression where BL21 (DE3) strain was retransformed with the plasmid containing either Cjtox I or Cjtox 11 gene, the supernatants of both cell lysates showed hemolytic activity on the equine erythrocytes. Preincubation of the supernatants with sphingomyelin caused reduced activity, implying that the CJTOX I and II would target sphingomyelin as with other actinoporins. Because of the structures similarity to the known actinoporins and the sphingomyelin-inhibitable hemolytic activity, both CJTOX I and II were concluded to be new actinoporins, which were identified for the first time from a deep-sea anemone.

AB Bothrops lanceolatus is an endemic viperid species in the Lesser Caribbean island of Martinique. Envenomings by this species are characterized by local and systemic effects, among which the development of thrombosis in various organs is the most severe complication. An experimental toxicological characterization of this venom was performed using in vivo mouse tests and various in vitro assays. The venom induced lethal, local and systemic hemorrhagic, edema-forming, myotoxic, thrombocytopenic, proteinase and phospholipase A(2) activities. The preclinical efficacy of a batch of monospecific Bothrofav antivenom currently in use in Martinique was assessed. The antivenom was highly effective in the neutralization of all activities tested, in agreement with its described clinical efficacy. This batch of antivenom showed a higher preclinical efficacy as compared to a previous batch used in the past. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The molecular mechanism of the local hypersensitivity reactions to wasp venom including dermal necrosis remains an enigma regardless of the numerosity of the reported cases. In this study, we discovered a new membrane disrupting toxin, VESCP-M2 responsible for tissue damage symptoms following Vespa mandarinia envenomation. Electrophysiological assays revealed a potent ability of VESCP-M2 to permeate the cell membrane whereas in vivo experiments demonstrated that VESCP-M2 induces edema, pain and dermal necrosis characterized by the presence of morphological and behavioral phenotypes, pro-inflammatory mediators, biomarkers as well as the disruption of dermal tissue. This study presents the molecular mechanism and symptom-related function of VESCP-M2 which may form a basis for prognosis as well as therapeutic interventions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Snakebite is a public health problem in many countries of world. These accidents are considered a Neglected Tropical Disease and are responsible for a high morbidity and mortality index in the South and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Angolan snake venoms are poorly investigated and no specific antivenom against them is available in the country. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate biochemical and immunogenic properties of male and female venoms from Naja nigricollis, Bitis arietans and Bids gabonica snakes. These animals were collected during an expedition covering 1350 km of Angola, including the Provinces of Cuanza Sul, Benguela, Huila and Malanje. Results showed that Angolan snake venoms present distinctive immunogenic properties and large intra-specific variations, associated to the gender and the geographic origin of the animals. Thus, it is possible to suggest that for the preparation of a therapeutic antivenom, intra-species variability should be taken into account, in order to obtain an efficient serum to neutralize the toxic effects of the Angolan snake venoms.

AB It is known that tetrodotoxin (TTX), also known as pufferfish toxin, is an extremely potent neurotoxin and had been detected in various taxa. However, the exact function of the toxin in TTX-bearing organisms has remained unclear. In Takifugu pufferfish species, it has been suggested that TTX is utilized to protect larvae from predators but no experimental proof exists. In the present study, we used pufferfish Takifugu alboplumbeus larvae from wild and cultured parents to determine the effects of the maternal TTX on the survival of toxic and non-toxic pufferfish larvae, respectively. TTX contents in the larval pufferfish differed between the larvae derived from wild and cultured parents (1.23 +/- 0.20 ng/individual vs. undetectable levels, respectively). Immunohistochemical staining with anti-TTX monoclonal antibody demonstrated that the TTX-specific signals were primarily observed at the body surface of the larvae of wild parents, but not of cultured parents. Predation experiments demonstrated that the juveniles of Girella punctata and Chaenogobius gulosus, used as predator fish, ingested the pufferfish larvae derived from either type of parents, but instantly spat out those from wild parents only. These results indicate that larvae, which are at the most vulnerable stage in the life of pufferfish, are protected by maternal TTX. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Snakebite envenoming by viperid species, and by some elapids, is characterized by a complex pattern of tissue damage at the anatomical site of venom injection. In severe cases, tissue destruction may be so extensive as to lead to permanent sequelae, with serious pathophysiological, social and psychological consequences. Significant advances have been performed in the study of venom-induced tissue damage, including identification and characterization of the toxins involved, insights into the mechanisms of action of venoms and toxins, and study of tissue responses to venom-induced injury. Nevertheless, much remains to be known and understood on the pathogenesis of these alterations. This review focuses on some of the pending issues in the topic of snake venom-induced local tissue damage. The traditional 'reductionist' approach, which has predominated in the study of snake venoms and their actions, needs to be complemented by more integrative and holistic perspectives aimed at capturing the complexity of these pathological alterations. Future advances in the study of these topics will certainly pave the way for innovative therapeutic interventions, with the goal of reducing the impact of this aspect of snakebite envenoming.

AB Bothrops cotiara is a pitviper found in Southeastern Brazil and, scarcely, in the Misiones province of Argentina. In contrast to considerable information available on the venom of the Brazilian snake population, that of Misiones has received little attention. While exploring the chromatographic venom profile of Argentinean B. cotiara, a major protein peak was found which, according to a previous study, is not present in the venom of Brazilian origin. The corresponding protein was isolated by RP-HPLC, and characterized by electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) assay, and myotoxic activities. Representing nearly 15% of B. cotiara venom from Misiones, this protein was identified as a Lys49 PLA(2) homologue. In accordance with the characteristics of this toxin family, the protein induced myo-toxicity in mice and was devoid of PLA(2) activity. Since previous work reported that no PLA(2) or PLA(2)-homologues occur in B. cotiara venom of Brazilian origin, the presence of an abundant Lys49 PLA(2) homologue in the venom from Misiones highlights a striking phenotypic variation in toxin expression within two populations of a single snake species inhabiting different geographic areas. The considerable proportion of B. cotiara Lys49 PLA(2) homologue myotoxin in the venom alerts that skeletal muscle necrosis might be a potentially relevant consequence of eventual envenomings by this species in Misiones.

AB Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) have been implicated as the cause of enterotoxemias, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans and edema disease (ED) of pigs. Stx1 and Stx2 are the most common types found in association with illness, but only Stx2e is associated with disease in the animal host. Porcine edema disease is a serious affection which can lead to dead causing great losses of weaned piglets. Stx2e is the most frequent Stx variant found in porcine feces and is considered the key virulence factor involved in the pathogenesis of porcine edema disease. Stx2e binds with higher affinity to Gb4 receptor than to Gb3 which could be due to amino acid changes in B subunit. Moreover, this subtype also binds to Forssman glycosphingolipids conferring upon Stx2e a unique promiscuous recognition feature. Manifestations of edema disease are caused by systemic effects of Stx2e with no significant morphologic changes in enterocytes. Endothelial cell necrosis in the brain is an early event in the pathogenesis of ED caused by Stx2e-producing STEC strains. Further studies are needed to generate techniques and tools which allow to understand the circulation and ecology of STEC strains in pigs even in resistant animals for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes.

AB A receptor binding assay (RBA) for the determination of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxicity is formally validated through collaborative study and approved for regulatory monitoring use in the US for mussels and clams. However, to date, the method has not been tested on bivalve molluscs originating from European waters and no validation studies have been conducted for oysters, a shellfish species of great importance globally. This study firstly reports the work conducted to assess the performance of the assay in comparison with a regulatory chemical detection method for a range of shellfish species originating from Great Britain. Data obtained showed a complete absence of false negative RBA results, with a tendency to over-estimate PSP toxicity for some shellfish species in comparison with liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Secondly, the performance of the RBA was assessed for oysters, with the analysis of a dilution series of oyster matrix certified reference materials. Method trueness, sensitivity and precision were found to compare well with results reported previously for other species. In addition, the RBA analysis of untreated and demetallated oyster extracts, provided good evidence that the RBA is not suppressed in the presence of high concentrations of zinc as reported previously for the mouse bioassay. Consequently, there is strong evidence from this study, that the RBA would be suitable for determination of PSP toxicity in bivalve molluscs from GB, with acceptable method performance in oysters. Further validation studies would be required for other shellfish species of interest before the method can be considered suitable for implementation in Europe. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cancer is one of the most troubling diseases and is becoming increasingly common. Breast cancer has a high cure rate when diagnosed early, but when diagnosed late, treatment is frequently painful, devastating and unsuccessful. The search for new treatments that are more effective and less harmful has led to several substances and biomolecules from plants and animals with potential anti-tumor activity. Within this context, ticks have emerged as an excellent source of new molecules with a wide array of therapeutic properties. Various molecules in tick saliva have immunomodulatory, anticoagulant, antiinflammatory and anti-tumor effects across different tumor cell lines. Our study evaluates the effect of saliva from three widespread and important tick species in Brazil (Amblyomma sculptum, Amblyomma parvum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus) on MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and on the nonneoplastic MCF-10A cell line. We found that tick saliva from all three tick species showed cytotoxicity to tumor cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) but not to the non-tumor cells (MCF-10A). Morphological changes on the surface of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells did not occur on the MCF-10A cells. We also demonstrated that tumor cells die by apoptosis induced by caspase-3 and caspase 7 activity, suggesting that intrinsic pathway apoptosis may be triggered by tick saliva. These changes were not observed in MCF10A cells, which remained broadly unchanged even after exposure to diverse types of saliva. These results suggest that tick saliva from these tick species is a source of molecules, or biomolecules, useful for the potential source for the development of new breast cancer drugs.

AB In Mexico more than 40% of reported snakebites are due to rattlesnake species. In general, the venoms of these snakes are characterized by the presence of highly enzymatic components that could provoke coagulopathies, local and systemic tissue damage and some cases neurotoxicity. In northwestern Mexico (Baja California Peninsula, Gulf of California and Pacific islands), 15 species of Crotalus are distributed. Such a biodiversity implies a high variability in venom compositions that in turns would results in high variability in clinical manifestations. In this work, venoms of Crotalus catalinensis, C. enyo enyo, C. mitcllellii mitchellii and C. ruber lucasensis were studied. Lethal doses from 0.35 to 9.21 mg/kg were obtained being venom of C. m. mitchellii the most potent of all. Venoms of C catalinensis, C. e. enyo and C. r. lucasensis show high hemorrhagic potency (1.34, 1.48 and 1.68 mu g respectively). Coagulant activity was found in venoms of C. catalinensis (4.6 mu g), C. e. enyo (101.9 mu g) and C. m. mitchellii (13.6 mu g). Our results point out hemorrhage as one of the most expected signs by three of the four most abundant species in the area. Also, neurotoxicity must be expected by C. m. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Snakes are the major group of venomous vertebrates, and the rear-fanged snakes represent the vast majority of species and occur worldwide; however, relatively few studies have characterized their venoms and evaluated their potential hazards for humans. Herein we explore the protein composition and properties of the venom of the rear-fanged Green Parrot Snake, Leptophis ahaetulla marginatus, the most common snake found in the lguazu National Park (Argentina), as well as the main features of its venom delivery system. This species has venom reminiscent of elapid venoms, composed mainly of components such as 3FTxs, CRiSPs and AChE, but it shows low toxicity toward mammals (LD50 > 20 mu g/g mouse). The histology of its Duvernoy's venom gland is similar to that of other colubrids, with serous secretory cells arranged in densely packed secretory tubules. The posterior end of its maxilla exhibits 1-3 blade-shaped and slightly recurved fangs but without grooves. This study provides an initial analysis of the biological role of venom in Leptophis, with implications for potential symptoms that might be anticipated from bites by this species.

AB Venoms from snakes are rich sources of highly active proteins with potent affinity towards a variety of enzymes and receptors. Of the many distinct toxicities caused by envenomation, neurotoxicity plays an important role in the paralysis of prey by snakes as well as by venomous sea snails and insects. In order to improve the analytical discovery component of venom toxicity profiling, this paper describes the implementation of microfluidic high-resolution screening (HRS) to obtain neurotoxicity fingerprints from venoms that facilitates identification of the neurotoxic components of envenomation. To demonstrate this workflow, 47 snake venoms were profiled using the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) to mimic the target of neurotoxic proteins, in particular nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In the microfluidic HRS system, nanoliquid chromatographic (nanoLC) separations were on-line connected to both AChBP profiling and parallel mass spectrometry (MS). For virtually all neurotoxic elapid snake venoms tested, we obtained bioactivity fingerprints showing major and minor bioactive zones containing masses consistent with three-finger toxins (3FTxs), whereas, viperid and colubrid venoms showed little or no detectable bioactivity. Our findings demonstrate that venom interactions with AChBP correlate with the severity of neurotoxicity observed following human envenoming by different snake species. We further, as proof of principle, characterized bioactive venom peptides from a viperid (Daboia russelli) and an elapid (Aspidelaps scutatus scutatus) snake by nanoLC-MS/MS, revealing that different toxin classes interact with the AChBP, and that this binding correlates with the inhibition of alpha 7-nAChR in calcium-flux cell-based assays. The on-line post-column binding assay and subsequent toxin characterization methodologies described here provide a new in vitro analytic platform for rapidly investigating neurotoxic snake venom proteins.

AB In the present paper, a novel method is proposed to enhance the power production and resolve the inconsistent electricity generation of solar chimney power plants (SCPPs) during nighttime. For this purpose, an integrated renewable cycle is proposed by incorporating two technologies: solar chimney and waste-to-energy. The combination is performed by exploiting the warm air of the condensers outlet into the SCPP. The waste-to-energy (WTE) plant in Tehran is thermodynamically analyzed and the mass flow rate of the condensers cooling air is found. Results indicate that by decreasing the humidity of the municipal solid waste (MSW) from 40% to 30% or by increasing MSW feeding rate (0.934-1.146 kg/s), the mass flow rate of the condenser cooling air increases from 190.3 kg/s to 233.7 kg/s. In addition, by increasing the feeding rate or by decreasing the humidity of MSW in the mentioned range, net power output of the WTE plant increases from 1350 kW to 1650 kW. The best injection method is proposed for the warm air of the condensers outlet into the SCPP. Subsequently, the average power increase is examined in different months and parametric study is performed to assess the influence of the effective WTE parameters and meteorological variables on the power output of the SCPP. The final power of the SCPP reaches 20-70 kW (even at the hottest night of the year with 5% relative humidity) and increases 20-1200% and 65-94% (monthly average) compared to the case of without injection. Results demonstrate that in the integrated system, by a 22% increase in the MSW feeding rate (from 0.934 kg/s to 1.146 kg/s) or by decreasing the MSW moisture content (from 40% to 30%), power output of the WTE plant and SCPP increases by 22% and 7%, respectively. Additionally, relative humidity of the surrounding air can increase the SCPP power production by 25%. In addition, the results indicate that wind speeds higher than 12.5 m/s will not affect power production of the SCPP, while relative humidity of the surrounding air, ambient temperature, the MSW feeding rate, and humidity of the MSW have considerable effects on the SCPP power production. In average, total energy and useful exergy efficiency of the proposed system is increased by 0.15% and 0.12% compared to the standalone WTE plant during nighttime. The integration of SCPP with the WTE plant is an applicable method to enhance the power generation and overcome the inconsistent power production of SCPP during nighttime.

AB A new model of the energy selective electron (ESE) device composed of four electron reservoirs and four energy filters is proposed. The device can work as a thermal amplifier, which may be equivalent to a coupling system consisting of two three-electron-reservoir heat pumps. Expressions for the heat-pumping rate (HPR) and coefficient of performance (COP) of the device are analytically derived through the heat flows of two-terminal ESE devices. The maximum HPR and COP are calculated. It is found that the maximum HPR of the coupling system can attain 2 times of that of a three-electron-reservoir heat pump while its COP is still equal to that of a three-electron-reservoir heat pump. Moreover, the effects of the chemical potentials of electron reservoirs, central levels of energy filters, half width at half maximum of energy filters on the HPR and COP of the device are discussed in detail. The optimal configuration of the device is determined. The cut-off value of the half width at half maximum of energy filters is calculated. The optimum selection criteria of main parameters are provided.

AB The effects of thermal throat on flame stabilization in a kerosene fueled supersonic combustor were numerically and experimentally studied in the present paper. The results were obtained under the inflow condition of stagnation temperature 1100 K, stagnation pressure 1.0 MPa and Mach number 2.0. Wall pressure measurements and flame emission images were made during the experiments in an attempt to better understand the flame development, results showed the combustion organization scheme had a great effect on flame stabilization in the combustor. The flame development process in each case was different according to the flame luminosity pictures. When the pilot hydrogen was removed, the flame of case 1 and case 2 was still stable, and that of case 3 was blown off by the high-speed air flow, but it was surprised to find that the flame of case 4 was blowout even the pilot hydrogen existed. A shock train had generated in the isolator due to the thermal throat existing, which decreased the high-speed main stream, and increased the temperature and pressure, also enhanced the fuel mixing efficiency in the combustor, this was why the flame stabilization was achieved. But if the thermal throat disappeared, the shock train would be pushed out of the combustor by the high-speed air flow. The residence time for mixing, ignition and combustion was getting shorter, the flame was blown off finally.

AB Global sensitivity analysis of the efficiency of borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) during long-term operation on the borehole heat exchanger (BHE) arrangement was investigated to advance understanding of the system's thermal performance. Three parameters were assessed to determine the BHE arrangement: the first parameter designate the distance between BHE axis in x direction, the second in y direction and the third an angle between top surface of the rock mass and boreholes axis. Conducting research on the real system is extremely expensive, so it was decided to conduct simulation studies utilising a finite element method. The ANSYS software with a newly implemented heat and mass transport model in BHE was used. Based on conducted numerical simulations, and according to the design of the experiment, a multidimensional response surface was achieved. The global sensitivity was conducted based on a response surface model. It was found that the BHE inclination (S-Eeff(P3) = 0.97 - FAST algorithm) has a crucial impact for the BTES efficiency. The area on response surface, where the optimal BHE arrangement to maximise BTES efficiency could be reached, is an inclination P3 = 0 degrees and BHE spacing in the range of P1 = P2 = (1.5-3 m).

AB The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is a complex mixture of easily digestible compounds, mainly starchy materials, and hardly digestible compounds, mainly lignocelluloses. Thus, OFMSW has a high potential for biofuel production after the hydrolysis of carbohydrates. In this study, dilute-acid treatment was used for the hydrolysis of starchy materials, eliminating the amylases enzymes requirement. Besides, the acid treatment acted as a pretreatment for the improvement of lignocelluloses fractions prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses. The acid treatment was conducted with 0.5 and 1% (w/w) sulfuric acid at 130 and 160 degrees C for 0, 30, and 60 min. The treatment with 1% acid at 130 degrees C for 60 min resulted in the hydrolysate with the highest glucose concentration of 43.2 g/L, mainly originated from starchy materials, and the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of the treated solids resulted in a hydrolysate containing 23.4 g/L glucose, mainly from cellulose. These hydrolysates, containing different sugars and inhibitors, were then subjected to ethanolic fermentation using a highly inhibitor-tolerant strain of Zygomycetes fungi, Mucor indicus. Using acid treatment with 1% at 130 degrees C for 60 min, without detoxification, the ethanol yield of 44.6 and 44.4 g per 100 g glucose was obtained from hydrolysate and acid treatment liquor, respectively. The liquid remained after the separation of ethanol from fermentation liquor and the residual solid remained after enzymatic hydrolysis were subjected to anaerobic digestion for biogas production. Overall, 194.0 g ethanol and 144.8 L methane were produced from each kg of dry OFMSW through the consecutive processes. Therefore, without detoxification and amylases requirement, all biodegradable parts of MSW were converted to bioenergy in the form of ethanol and biogas, resulting in the production of 10,453 kJ energy and 326.6 mL gasoline equivalent from each kg of dry OFMSW.

AB In photovoltaic (PV) cells, a large portion of the solar-irradiance becomes heat which shoots the cell temperature up and decreases its electrical efficiency. The heat can be removed using phase-change-material (PCM) at the rear of the PV. In literature, the researchers have reported the performance of PV-PCM for their respective locations. However, selection criteria for climates suitable for PCM integration are not reported yet. Thus, it has been carried out in the current work. The model has been validated against the experimental measurements. It has been concluded that (i) the climates having less variations in the ambient temperature are more suitable for PCM integration. The electricity enhancement achieved by PV cooling is 9.7%. It reduces to 6.6% for the climate having large variations, (ii) Heat extraction by PCM-systems is more effective in warm climates in comparison to cold climates, (iii) PCM integration performs better in climates with low wind-speed, (iv) PCM is more effective for the climates where wind-flow is across the PV and (v) Climates having high solar-radiation is better for heat removal by PCM.

AB This paper proposes the implementation of cost-effective commercially available automotive components in small-scale power plants for the energy generation from carbon-neutral biomass. Specifically, a turbocharger and a power turbine of turbo-compound systems are proposed to be coupled with an external combustor and a high temperature heat exchanger in order to obtain a cheap externally fired gas turbine capable of producing about 30 kW of electrical power from the combustion of pruning residues. The externally fired gas turbine cycle can be combined either with a final heat exchanger to generate useful thermal power or with a bottoming cycle to generate useful thermal power and an additional electrical power of about 15 kW. Two plant configurations are proposed for the bottoming cycle: the first is a water Rankine cycle employing the "green steam turbine" as the steam expander, whereas the second is an organic Rankine cycle using an axial turbine and toluene as the working fluid. The results of the simulations, obtained through a detailed thermodynamic model, show that the use of a combined cycle is fundamental to maximize the primary energy savings of the power plant. In the case of negligible pressure losses, the use of a bottoming water Rankine cycle leads to a maximum second law efficiency of about 0.25 and maximum primary energy savings of about 0.23. Instead, a bottoming organic Rankine cycle employing a single stage turbine can increase the second law efficiency and the primary energy savings up to about 0.27 and 0.26, respectively. It is also demonstrated that the use of a two-stage turbine for the organic Rankine cycle can further enhance the plant performance. The effects of the pressure drops in the system are investigated in detail to point out that the minimization of the pressure losses is fundamental to improve the performance parameters of all the proposed configurations.

AB In this paper, a novel method of maximum power point tracking of renewable energy generators is proposed, utilizing the sum of dynamic and static conductance as maximum power point tracking loop variable. This allows to formulate the maximum power point tracking problem as a typical closed-loop stabilization task of non-linear static plant with zero reference. Consequently, a simple integrative controller is shown to be sufficient to ensure zero steady-state maximum power point tracking error with easily determinable nominal dynamics. A recently revealed method of online photovoltaic generator dynamic conductance estimation allowing robust terminal voltage control is utilized. Moreover, it is revealed that the resulting maximum power point tracking loop plant is piecewise linear around the maximum power point, i.e. for given environmental conditions two different convergence rates are expected, depending on the relative value of operating voltage to maximum power point voltage. Presented analytical outcomes are verified by application of the proposed maximum power point tracking structure to a grid-connected photovoltaic generator system under robust voltage control.

AB In previous years, unconventional fuel studies have been conducted by many researchers through their experimental work and numerical simulation. Running down of fossil fuel raised crisis of full fill demand of energy consumption in the world. The attention of researchers to investigate renewable energy sources such as biodiesel are suggested, which are less destructive for environmental. The paper is aimed to mitigate emissions parameter like NOx, smoke, particulate matter (PM) and summary of emissions (SE) from five different categories such as, edible and non-edible vegetable oils, waste animal fats, waste oil and alcohol biodiesel. Two experimental validations were conducted on a single cylinder, direct injection diesel engine at constant advanced injection timing and speed with diesel, for a Diesel-RK model. Numerical analysis shows that most effected NOx pollutant emission for soybean (edible) by 21.79%, jojoba curcas (non-edible) by 23.0%, chicken fats (animal fats) by31.2%, grease oil (waste oil) by 15.8% and butanol (alcohol) by 94.56%. The PM emission are reduced by 45.59%, 84.97%, 93.78%, 23.83%, 48.18% for soybean, microalgae, poultry fats, frying oil and pentanol respectively and also reductions in smoke emission by 93.8%, 93.43%, 92.26%, 89.14% and 79.14% for sunflower, karanja oil, fish oil, frying oil and pentanol respectively. The most effected summary of emissions (SE) are reduced by 3.91%, 15.66%, 43.37%, 3.01% and 37.65% for soybean, jojoba curcas, veal oil, grease oil and pentanol respectively; at full load and engine speed, injection timing and compression ratio were remained unchanged.

AB In integrated Photovoltaic (PV) systems, integrating the back side of the PV module with building wall insulate it from the surrounding air causing a dramatically increase of the PV temperature. The increase of the PV temperature causes a substantial decrease of its efficiency and output power. The idea of the present work is the investigation of the thermal regulation and efficiency enhancement of PV-building integrated system using phase change materials (PCM) and Al2O3 nanoparticles. The approach of the study is experimentally testing three separate PV modules integrated with building wall, pure PCM and PCM/Al2O3 nanoparticles compound at the same time and location. Temperatures distributions, open-circuit voltage, short- circuit current, output power and the modules efficiencies were recorded and analyzed. The results show that (i) integrating the PCM to the back side of the integrate PV modules regulates the module temperature and improves its efficiency, (ii) adding Al2O3 nanoparticles to the PCM further increase the possibility of the temperature regulation and the thermal efficiency of the integrated modules, and (iii) integrating the PV with pure PCM and enhanced PCM by nanoparticles can drop the temperature of the modules by 8.1 and 10.6 degrees C and increase its efficiency by 5.7 and 13.2%, respectively.

AB The cost competitiveness of an optimised solar combined heating and power (S-CHP) system based on a novel PVT collector is assessed in three different locations (Zaragoza, London and Athens). A series of sensitivity analyses are undertaken to evaluate the extent of the influence of the several economic parameters on the cost competitiveness of the proposed solar solution, and evaluate the need for financial incentives to boost the installation of this technology, in particular in the residential sector. From the different systems components' costs, the results show that the PVT collector price is the one that influences more the system economics, as it responsible of the highest share of the total investment (similar to 38%). High market discount rates and/or low inflation rates significantly and negatively affect the system cost competitiveness, leading to higher payback times (PBTs). Government incentives, if correctly applied, have the potential to improve the system economics in the shortterm. However, in low latitude locations these incentives might not be necessary as high irradiance levels and energy prices lead to reasonable PBTs. Finally, the analysis of potential future scenarios, considering a combination of several economic parameters, demonstrates that the S-CHP system cost competitiveness is feasible in the short term.

AB Enzymes that lengthen the carbon chain of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are key to the biosynthesis of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). Here we report on the molecular cloning, tissue distribution, functional characterization and nutritional regulation of a elovl5 gene from Nibea coibor. The full-length cDNA was 1315 bp, including a 5-untranslated region (UTR) of 134 bp, a 3-UTR of 296 bp and an open reading frame of 885 bp, which specified a peptide of 294 amino acids. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the deduced peptide sequence possessed all the characteristic features of microsomal fatty acyl elongases, including the so-called histidine box (HXXHH), the canonical C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, several predicted transmembrane regions and other highly conserved motifs. Expression of elovl5 was strongly observed in stomach, and more weakly in kidney, spleen, intestine, brain, eye, liver, gill, muscle and heart. Functional characterization revealed that the chu's croaker Elovl5 was able to elongate both C18 and C20 PUFA substrates. Nutritional study indicated that the hepatic expression of elovl5 could be up-regulated by low dietary n - 3 LC-PUFA. These results may contribute to better understanding the LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway and regulation mechanism in chu's croaker.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary tumor of the liver, has a poor prognosis and shows rapid progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) are critical for defining G-protein-dependent signal fidelity. RGS17 plays an important role in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Here, we showed that miR-199 was downregulated in a hepatocarcinoma cell line. Overexpression of miR-199 significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. RGS17 overexpression promoted HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and reversed the miR-199 mediated inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion. Dual-fluorescence reporter experiments confirmed that miR-199 downregulated RGS17 by direct interaction with the 3'-UTR of RGS17 mRNA. In vivo studies showed that miR-199 overexpression significantly inhibited the growth of tumors. Taken together, the results suggested that miR-199 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis by targeting RGS17.

AB Exponentially growing scientific knowledge in scientific publications has resulted in the emergence of a new interdisciplinary science of literature mining. In text mining, the machine reads the published literature and transfers the discovered knowledge to mathematical-like formulas. In an integrative approach in this study, we used text mining in combination with network discovery, pathway analysis, and enrichment analysis of genomic regions for better understanding of biomarkers in lung cancer. Particular attention was paid to non-coding biomarkers. In total, 60 MicroRNA biomarkers were reported for lung cancer, including some prognostic biomarkers. MIR21, MIR155, MALAT1, and MIR31 were the top non-coding RNA biomarkers of lung cancer. Text mining identified 447 proteins which have been studied as biomarkers in lung cancer. EGFR (receptor), TP53 (transcription factor), KRAS, CDKN2A, ENO2, KRT19, RASSF1, GRP (ligand), SHOX2 (transcription factor), and ERBB2 (receptor) were the most studied proteins. Within small molecules, thymosin-al, oestrogen, and 8-OHdG have received more attention. We found some chromosomal bands, such as 7q32.2, 18q12.1, 6p12, 11p15.5, and 3p21.3 that are highly involved in deriving lung cancer biomarkers.

AB Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) polymorphisms have been found associated with MetS and serum 25(OH)D levels but these associations remain controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the VDR polymorphisms and MetS, metabolic components, and serum 25(OH)D levels within the Thai population. A case control study included 237 participants with MetS according to the MetS diagnostic criteria of NCEP ATPIII and 376 controls. Anthropometric data, blood pressure, lipid profiles, serum 25 (OH)D, and fasting blood glucose were measured. VDR Fokl, Bsml, Taql, and Cdx2 polymorphisms were genotyped by using PCR-HRM. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of VDR genotypes and alleles between MetS and the control groups. VDR Tagl TT, and Bsml BB + Bb genotypes were associated with lower 25(OH)D levels (p < 0.05) in comparison to Taql Tt, and Bsml bb genotypes in the MetS group, respectively. In addition, the VDR Cdx2 GG genotype was associated with higher WC compared with the AG genotype in all subjects (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that BB + Bb genotypes of the VDR Bsml had significantly increased the odds ratio (OR) of hypertriglyceridemia when compared with the bb genotype (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.10-3.19, p = 0.022). In conclusion, VDR Bsml variant was associated with hypertriglyceridemia and may be predisposed to developing MetS. VDR Tag' and Bsml polymorphisms seems to influence serum 25(OH)D levels in MetS subjects, while Cdx2 polymorphism may influence WC in all subjects.

AB Purpose: Hyperglycemia is the high risk factor of vascular remodeling induced by angioplasty, and neointimal hyperplasia is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling caused by carotid artery balloon injury. Studies have shown that MicroRNA 24 (miR-24) plays an important role in angiocardiopathy, However, the role of miR-24 is far from thorough research. In this study, we investigate whether up-regulation of miR-24 by using miR-24 recombinant adenovirus (Ad-miR-24-GFP) can inhibit PDGF-BB signaling pathway and attenuate vascular remodeling in the diabetic rat model.
   Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 60) were randomly divided into 5 groups and fed with high sugar and high fat diet (Sham, Saline, Scramble, Ad-miR-24 groups), or ordinary diet (Control group). The front four groups were treated with streptozotocin (STZ) four weeks later and the blood glucose level was closely monitored. After the successful establishment of diabetic rats, the external carotid artery was injured by pressuring balloon 1.5 after internal carotid artery ligation, then the blood vessels were harvested 14 days later and indexes were detected including the following: HE staining for the level of vascular intima thickness, immunohistochemical detection for PCNA and P27 to test the proliferative degree of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), qRT-PCR for the level of miR-24, RAS,PDGF-R, western blot for the protein levels of JNK1/2, p-JNK1/ 2, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, RAS, PDGF-R, AP-1,P27 and PCNA. Serological detection was conducted for TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8.
   Results: The delivery of Ad-miR-24 into balloon injury site has significantly increased the level of miR-24. Up regulation of miR-24 could regulate vascular remodeling effectively, lower the level of inflammatory factors, inhibit the expression of mRNA and protein levels of JNK1/2, ERK1/2, RAS, PDGF-R, AP-1, P27, PCNA.
   Conclusion: miR-24 can inhibit the expression of AP-1 via the inhibition of PDGF-BB signaling pathway, thus inhibit VSMCs proliferation and vascular remodeling.

AB The Kriippel-like factors (KLF) family plays an important role in adipogenesis, which is subject to internal hierarchical regulation. KLF3 is a member of KLF family, mainly responsible for adipocyte differentiation and fat deposition. However, the transcriptional regulation of bovine KLF3 gene and its relationship with KLF15 gene remains unclear during bovine adipogenesis. Here, we report that the expression pattern of KLF3 and KLF15 genes during bovine adipogenesis, when KLF15 gene was overexpressed through adenoviral vector (Ad-KLF15) in bovine adipocytes the expression level of KLF3 gene was increased, similarly when KLF15 was down regulated through siRNA the expression level of KLF3 was also reduced. To explore the transcriptional regulation of bovine KLF3 gene and its relationship with KLF15, serial deletion constructs of the 5'flanking region of bovine KLF3gene revealed through dual-luciferase reporter assay that the core promoter is located in-264 to-76 regions. The most proximal GGGG element in the promoter of the bovine KLF3 gene (located in-264 to-76 regions) is required for promotion by KLF15. Electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays further confirmed that KLF15 gene binds to the KLF3 gene core promoter region in bovine adipocytes. These findings conclude that KLF15 promotes the transcriptional activity of KLF3 in bovine adipocytes. This mechanism to provides a new direction for further study of adipogenesis by internal regulation of members within KLF family.

AB Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) is characterized as low sperm count, decreased sperm motility and structural abnormalities of the sperm head in the same patient. However, very few studies reported the genetic alterations associated with OAT. Here we report a 38-year-old patient with OAT from a consanguineous family, with 2-6 million/mL sperm density, 2.1-3.8% normal sperm morphology and immotile sperm. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified homozygous variant c.1259A > G:p.Y420C in the TDRD6 gene. TDRD6 is a testis specific expressed protein that was localized to the chromatoid bodies in germ cells and played an important role in the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. This rare variant co-segregated with the OAT phenotype in this family. Bioinformatic analysis also suggested the variant a pathogenic mutation. Two intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles were carried out in the patient's wife, but she did not become pregnant after embryo transfer. So the mutations in TDRD6 may be associated with human male infertility and early embryonic lethality.

AB Deafness and myopia syndrome is characterized by moderate-profound, bilateral, congenital or prelingual deafness and high myopia. Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss is one of the most prevalent human genetic sensorineural defects. Myopia is by far the most common human eye disorder that is known to have a clear heritable component. The analysis of the two exons of SLITRK6 gene in a Moroccan family allowed us to identify a novel single deleterious mutation c.696delG, p.Trp232Cysfs*10 at homozygous state in the exon 2 of the SLITRK6, a gene reported to cause deafness and myopia in various populations.

AB Heredity is a well-known risk factor for varicose veins, but genetic basis of this condition remains poorly studied. Our aim was to conduct a large-scale genetic association study for primary varicose veins (PVVs) in the population of ethnic Russians. An initial scan using Illumina HumanExome-12 v1.0 BeadChip was performed for 273 patients with PVVs and 250 controls without a history of chronic venous disease and other venous disorders. After quality control and removal of monomorphic markers, 25,424 common and 48,232 rare variants were included in the analysis. 42 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in the independent replication cohort of 447 PVVs patients and 443 controls. Association of common variants with PVVs was investigated by logistic regression, and the impact of rare variants was analyzed using sequence kernel association test. No effect of low frequency alleles has been revealed in our study. Common variant analysis identified a promising signal at chromosome 6 within classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III subregion. The most strongly associated SNP in a combined analysis that reached a suggestive significance level of 3.2e - 05 was polymorphism rs4151657 in the complement factor B gene. Testing for potential pleiotropy with other traits indicated that the same causal variant in this region increases the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and has a negative impact on human height. Our results provide suggestive evidence for the involvement of the MHC class III genes in the pathogenesis of PVVs. Further independent studies are needed to confirm our pilot findings.

AB Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB), caused by the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Setosphaeria turcica, is one of the major foliar diseases of maize. The use of resistant cultivars is the most effective, economical, and environmentally friendly means to control NCLB. At present, the molecular mechanisms of maize resistance to S. turcica is not clear. Elucidating the molecular resistance mechanisms of maize response to S. turcica would aid breeding for a maize variety with fungal tolerance. In this study, maize leaves before and after infection with S. turcica were sequenced by RNA-seq, and 5903 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened. Among them, 950 and 2245 genes were up-regulated 12 h and 60 h (samples H12 and H60, respectively) after infection, 752 and 1956 genes were down-regulated in 1-112 and 1-160, respectively. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that the GO and Pathway with the most annotation sequences were closely related to plant resistance. The expression of eight randomly selected DEGs was analyzed using qRT-PCR, and expression was consistent with the RNA-seq data. The expression patterns of four categories of genes were analyzed namely, genes involved in plant and pathogen interactions, transcription factors related to plant stress-tolerance, genes related to plant hormones and plant antioxidant. Many resistant signaling pathways were initiated such as the MAPK signal transduction pathway and the expression of multiple antioxidant-related genes [Peroxidase (POD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)] following S. turcica infection. Many disease resistance signal transduction pathways and defense response pathways were induced following maize infection by S. turcica, suggesting a multiple gene network system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that RNA-seq technology has been used to perform transcription analysis of maize in response to S. turcica stress. Taken together, these data provide novel and valuable information that will help understand the resistance mechanism in maize against S. turcica and locate candidate genes related to maize resistance against S. turcica.

AB Background: Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of central nervous system. MicroRNAs play important roles in autoimmune diseases such as MS. Objectives: The aim was to evaluate the expression pattern of miR-34a, miR-199a, miR-30c and miR-19a in peripheral blood derived CD4 + T lymphocytes of both relapsing and remitting phases of MS.
   Methods: Blood samples from 40 RRMS patients (20 in relapsing and 20 in remitting phase) and 20 healthy volunteers were taken. CD4 + T cells were isolated. The expression level of miR-34a, miR-199a, miR-30c and miR-19a, and the percentage of Th17 and Treg cells were measured. Expression of master transcription factors of Th17 and Treg cells and several targets of these miRNAs were also evaluated.
   Results: Data indicated an increased expression of miR-34a, miR-30c and miR-19a in relapsing phase and decreased expression of miR-199a in remitting phase. ROC curve data add other prestigious information of miR-34a, miR-199a, miR-30c and miR-19a by defining relapsing and remitting phase and also healthy cases with high specificity and sensitivity at a proposed optimum cut-off point.
   Conclusion: Collectively, we showed a correlation between the four miRNAs with different phases of MS and their possible involvement in differentiation pathways of Th17 cells, as the most important players in MS.

AB Background: Mechanisms of metabolic syndrome (MetS) causation are complex, genetic and environmental factors are important factors for the pathogenesis of MetS In this study, we aimed to evaluate familial and genetic influences on metabolic syndrome risk factor and also assess association between FTO (rs1558902 and rs7202116) and CETP(rs1864163) genes' single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with low HDL_C in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS).
   Materials and methods: The design was a cross-sectional study of 1776 members of 227 randomly-ascertained families. Selected families contained at least one affected metabolic syndrome and at least two members of the family had suffered a loss of EIDL_C according to ATP III criteria.
   In this study, after confirming the familial aggregation with intra-trait correlation coefficients (ICC) of Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the quantitative lipid traits, the genetic linkage analysis of HDL_C was performed using conditional logistic method with adjusted sex and age.
   Results: The results of the aggregation analysis revealed a higher correlation between siblings than between parent-offspring pairs representing the role of genetic factors in MetS. In addition, the conditional logistic model with covariates showed that the linkage results between HDL_C and three marker, rs1558902, rs7202116 and rs1864163 were significant.
   Conclusions: In summary, a high risk of MetS was found in siblings confirming the genetic influences of metabolic syndrome risk factor. Moreover, the power to detect linkage increases in the one parameter conditional logistic model regarding the use of age and sex as covariates.

AB Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene has an important role as a candidate gene for the regulation of bone mass in osteoporosis. However, its association with bone mineral density (BMD) is controversial and has not been established in different ethnic populations. To enhance the understanding of VDR gene polymorphism in the context of BMD, we investigated the plausible genetic association of TaqI and ApaI polymorphism with BMD in North Indian postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.254 osteoporotic women (Age 55.82 +/- 6.91) and 254 postmenopausal non osteoporotic women (Age 54.76 +/- 6.26) were included in the study. VDR Taql and ApaI polymorphism were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism). BMD was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine (Lt-L4), hip, forearm and femoral neck. The average BMD with TT genotype was significantly lower at lumbar spine, hip and forearm. The Frequency of TT genotype and t allele was significantly high in osteoporotic women when compared with controls. The average BMD with Aa genotype was higher in ApaI. Furthermore, comparison of frequency distribution of genotype and allele for VDR Apal between osteoporotic patients and controls did not show any significant difference. Our findings revealed that Taql gene TT genotype was associated with low BMD in North Indian osteoporotic women. Moreover, TT genotype and t allele associated significantly with osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Therefore, VDR Taql gene is an important determinant of risk factor for osteoporosis.

AB Fibroblast growth factor binding proteins (FGFBPs) are a class of secreted proteoglycans that function as an extracellular chaperone for locally stored FGFs and enhance FGF signaling. To date, all three human FGFBP genes have been identified and one orthologue fgfbp1a has been studied in zebrafish embryos. Here, we described the cloning and expression patterns of four novel FGFBP orthologues in zebrafish, fgfbp1b, fgfbp2a, fgfbp2b, and fgfbp3. Quantitative PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization results showed that all transcripts except fgfbp2a are initially expressed in a maternal manner. fgfbplb, fgfbp2b and fgfbp2a transcripts are expressed broadly in the head at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf), and then become restricted to the pharyngeal tissue, pectoral fins, and liver, respectively. fgfbp3 is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) throughout embryonic and larval development. In adults, fgfbp family manifests the tissue specific patterns of expression with fgfbp3 robustly expressed in muscle and heart. Our work offers a starting point to uncover roles of FGFBP family genes and the possible mechanisms of FGF-dependent and -independent actions of FGFBP in vertebrates.

AB Patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who have minor allele of the complement receptor 1 (CR1) gene, displayed more sub-optimal responder to eculizumab compared with major allele. To investigate polymorphism of the CR1 gene in Chinese patients with PNH and its correlation with clinical features and the potential impact on eculizumab efficiency, we genotyped CR1 rs2274567, rs3811381 and the intron 27 Hind III restriction fragment length polymorphism in 95patients with PNH and 96 controls. The results indicated that the genotypes of CR1 rs2274567, rs3811381 and the intron 27 Hind III in PNH patients and controls both consist with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs2274567 and rs3811381 in PNH patients and normal controls were lower compared with data from the dbSNP database. Further analysis showed that the MAF of Chinese patients was significantly lower than that of Caucasians (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0006 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The minor allele of CR1 rs2274567, rs3811381 and the intron 27 Hind III was associated with decreased of hemoglobin level (P = 0.007, P = 0.022,and P = 0.022, respectively) in our patients. However, there was no significantly difference found in other clinical parameters. In conclusion, the results demonstrated the minor alleles of CR1 polymorphisms were lower in Chinese patients than in Caucasians, with a decrease in hemoglobin level. These findings may indicate less sub-optimal responders to eculizumab in Chinese patients.

AB Background: Evidences show that cluster determinant 36 (CD36) protein plays a role in lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, and the expression of CD36 is inducible in obesity. The present study evaluated the association of CD36 variants and the interaction with obesity on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk.
   Methods: We performed a case-control study nested in the Rural Chinese Cohort Study. We included 546 incident T2DM cases matched with non-T2DM controls in a 1:1 ratio by sex, age (within 2 years), marital status, and residence village. Four loci in CD36 (rs1194197, rs2151916, rs3211956, and rs7755) were genotyped by SNPscan (TM) Genotyping system.
   Results: After adjusting for potential confounding, we observed no statistically significant association between the CD36 polymorphisms and T2DM risk. Compared to wild-type homozygous carriers with normal weight, overweight/obesity participants carrying the mutational allele rs7755 showed increased risk of T2DM, by 114% (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.33-3.46; P-interaction = 0.007); abdominal obesity participants carrying the mutational allele rs7755 showed increased risk of T2DM, by 133% (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.48-3.66; P-interaction = 0.002). Furthermore, rs2151916 polymorphism was associated with triglycerides level (P = 0.019), and the rs1194197 variant was related to systolic blood pressure (P = 0.023) within the group of controls.
   Conclusions: CD36 genotypes were not associated with the progression to T2DM independently. However, our results suggested a positive interaction between the CD36 variants and obesity on T2DM susceptibility, which might be through a cardiometabolic disorder.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial regulators of affecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and progression. However, the biological role and underlying molecular mechanism of miR-613 in HCC still remain well unknown. In the study, our results demonstrated that expression of miR-613 was significantly lower in HCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues by quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. The association between miR-613 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics analysis showed that lower miR-613 expression significantly associated with tumor size, vascular infiltration and poor prognostic outcome in HCC patients. In vitro, ectopic overexpression of miR-613 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and invasion capability, while down-regulated miR-613 had reversed effects. Furthermore, luciferase reporter gene assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot assays demonstrated that miR-613 target 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of YWHAZ and regulated its expression in HCC cells. Overexpression of YWHAZ partially abolished the tumor suppressing effects induced by upregulating miR-613 in HCC cells. Thus, our results implied that miR-613 may represent a novel potentially therapeutic target for HCC.

AB Chronic stress severely threatens the welfare and health of animals and humans. In order to study the effects of chronic stress on metabolism, de novo transcriptome sequencing was used to generate the expressed sequence tag dataset for the goat, using nextgeneration sequencing technology. For this study, consecutive dexamethasone (Dex) injection was used in 10 healthy male goats (body weight 25 +/- 1.0 kg) to mimic chronic stress. Ten male goats were randomly assigned into two groups, one group was injected intramuscularly with the same volume of saline as control (Con) group, and another (Dex) group was injected intramuscularly with 0.2 mg/kg Dex for 21 days. To elucidate the resulting changes in genes, transcriptome profiling of liver was conducted by analysing samples from three goats of each group using RNA-Seq. A total of 137 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between Con group and Dex group. GO classification showed rhythmic process and hormone secretion in term cellular, and chemoattractant activity in term molecular function had noticeable differences in the proportion between DEGs and all genes. By mapping the DEGs to the COG database, we found that general function prediction only, energy production and conversion, and amino acid transport and metabolism were the most frequently represented functional clusters. We mapped the unigenes to the KEGG pathway database and found most annotated genes were involved in the AMPK signalling pathway as well as pathways in cancer and insulin signalling pathway. Via KEGG enrichment analysis, we found the DEGs were significantly enriched in insulin signalling pathway, AMPK signalling pathway and adipocytokine signalling pathway. In addition, these pathways have close relationship with metabolism, which resulted in metabolic changes in which the identified DEGs may play important roles. These results provide valuable information for further research on the complex molecular mechanisms of dexamethasone in goats and will provide a foundation for future studies.

Optimal glycaemic control, as assessed by glycated haemoglobin, and avoidance of hyper-and hypoglycaemic excursions have been shown to prevent diabetes-related complications. Insulin pump use has increased considerably over the past decade with beneficial effects on glycaemic control, quality of life and treatment satisfaction. The advent and progress of ambulatory glucose sensor technology has enabled continuous glucose monitoring based on real-time glucose levels to be integrated with insulin therapy. Low glucose and predictive low glucose suspend systems are currently used in clinical practice to mitigate against hypoglycaemia, and provide the first step towards feedback glucose control. The more advanced technology approach, an artificial pancreas or a closed-loop system, gradually increases and decreases insulin delivery in a glucose-responsive fashion to mitigate against hyper-and hypoglycaemia. Randomised outpatient clinical trials over the past 5 years have demonstrated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the approach, and the recent FDA approval of the first single hormone closed-loop system establishes a new standard of care for people with type 1 diabetes.

AB The efficacy of pharmaceutical treatments can be greatly enhanced by physiological feedback from the patient using biosensors, though this is often invasive or infeasible. By adapting microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to miniaturize such biosensors, previously inaccessible signals can be obtained, often from inside the patient. This is enabled by the device's extremely small footprint which minimizes both power consumption and implantation trauma, as well as the transport time for chemical analytes, in turn decreasing the sensor's response time. MEMS fabrication also allows mass production which can be easily scaled without sacrificing its high reproducibility and reliability, and allows seamless integration with control circuitry and telemetry which is already produced using the same materials and fabrication steps. By integrating these systems with drug delivery devices, many of which are also MEMS-based, closed loop drug delivery can be achieved. This paper surveys the types of signal transduction devices available for biosensing-primarily electrochemical, optical, and mechanical-looking at their implementation via MEMS technology. The impact of MEMS technology on the challenges of biosensor development, particularly safety, power consumption, degradation, fouling, and foreign body response, are also discussed.

AB The high incidence of degenerative tears and prevalence of retears (20-95%) after surgical repair makes rotator cuff injuries a significant health problem. This high retear rate is attributed to the failure of the repaired tissue to regenerate the native tendon-to-bone insertion (enthesis). Biological augmentation of surgical repair such as autografts, allografts, and xenografts are confounded by donor site morbidity, immunogenicity, and disease transmission, respectively. In contrast, these risks may be alleviated via growth factor therapy, which can actively influence the healing environment to promote functional repair. Several challenges have to be overcome before growth factor delivery can translate into clinical practice such as the selection of optimal growth factor(s) or combination, identification of the most efficient stage and duration of delivery, and the design considerations for the delivery device. Emerging insight into the injury-repair microenvironment and our understanding of growth factor mechanisms in healing are informing the design of advanced delivery scaffolds to effectively treat rotator cuff tears. Here, we review potential growth factor candidates, design parameters and material selection for growth factor delivery, innovative and dynamic delivery scaffolds, and novel therapeutic targets from tendon and developmental biology for the structural and functional healing of rotator cuff repair.

AB Ensuring an adequate angiogenic response during wound healing is a prevailing clinical challenge in biomaterials science. To address this, we aimed to develop a pro-angiogenic gene-activated scaffold (GAS) that could activate MSCs to produce paracrine factors and influence angiogenesis and wound repair. A non-viral polyethyleneimine (PEI) nanoparticles carrying a gene encoding for stromal derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) was combined with a collagen-chondroitin sulfate scaffold to produce the GAS. The ability of this platform to enhance the angiogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was then assessed. We found that the MSCs on GAS exhibited early over-expression of SDF-1a mRNA with the activation of angiogenic markers VEGF and CXCR4. Exposing endothelial cells to conditioned media collected from GAS supported MSCs promoted a 20% increase in viability and 33% increase in tubule formation (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the conditioned media promoted a 50% increase in endothelial cell migration and wound closure (p < 0.005). Gene expression analysis of the endothelial cells revealed that the functional response was associated with up-regulation of angiogenic genes; VEGF, CXCR4, eNOS and SDF-1 alpha. Overall, this study shows collagen-based scaffolds combined with SDF-1 alpha gene therapy can provide enhanced pro-angiogenic response, suggesting a promising approach to overcome poor vasculature during wound healing.

AB Traditional coronary drug-eluting stents (DES) are made from metal and are coated with a permanent polymer film containing an anti-proliferative drug. Subsequent to stent deployment in a diseased coronary artery, the drug releases into the artery wall and helps prevent restenosis by inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Although this technology has proven to be remarkably successful, there are ongoing concerns that the presence of a polymer in the artery can lead to deleterious medical complications, such as late stent thrombosis. Polymer-free DES may help overcome such shortcomings. However, the absence of a rate-controlling polymer layer makes optimisation of the drug release profile a particular challenge. The use of microporous stent surfaces to modulate the drug release rate is an approach that has recently shown particularly promising clinical results. In this study, we develop a mathematical model to describe drug release from such stents. In particular, we develop a mathematical model to describe drug release from microporous surfaces. The model predicts a twostage release profile, with a relatively rapid initial release of most of the drug, followed by a slower release of the remaining drug. In the model, the slow release phase is accounted for by an adsorption/desorption mechanism close to the stent surface. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental release data obtained in our laboratory, and good agreement is found. The valuable insights provided by our model will serve as a useful guide for designing the enhanced polymer-free stents of the future.

AB Topical therapy of nail psoriasis using methotrexate has not been realized due to the high molecular weight and low permeability of the compound. In this study, we used a 2940 nm fractional ablative laser to disrupt the nail barrier to enhance the in vitro transungual delivery of methotrexate. Bovine hoof membrane. an in vitro model of the human nail. was treated by the laser at different energy levels and pore densities. A successful microporation was characterized by mechanical properties, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, dye binding, histology, pore uniformity, confocal laser microscopy, nail integrity measurement, and permeation studies. No significant difference in the pore dimension was found in different treatment groups (p > 0.05). Increases in pore depth corresponded with increases in the laser energy. Laser ablation was found to affect the mechanical properties of the hoof membrane. In in vitro permeation studies, laser ablation resulted in a significant increase in the drug cumulative delivery, flux, and permeability coefficient as compared to the untreated group (n = 3, p < 0.05). A change in the laser energy and pore density was found to alter the drug permeability. Thus, transungual methotrexate delivery was enhanced by the fractional laser ablation.

AB The goal of this work was to study the printability of PDMS with a semi-solid extrusion printer in combination with the UV-assisted crosslinking technology using UV-LED light to manufacture drug containing structures. Structures with different pore sizes and different drug loadings were prepared containing prednisolone as a model drug.
   The work showed that it was possible to print drug-free and drug-loaded drug delivery devices of PDMS with the 3D printing technique used in this study. The required UV-curing time to get sufficient crosslinking yield and mechanical strength was minimum three minutes. The microgram drug release from the printed structures was highest for the most drug loaded structures regardless of the porosity of the devices. By altering the surface area/volume ratio it was possible to print structures with differences in the release rate.
   This study shows that room-temperature semi-solid extrusion printing 3D printing technique in combination with UV-LED crosslinking is an applicable method in the production of prednisolone containing PDMS devices. Both the extrusion 3D printing and the UV-crosslinking was done at room temperature, which make this manufacturing method an interesting alternative for manufacturing controlled release devices containing temperature susceptible drugs.

   In addition, the Office of Generic Drugs(1) has established a regulatory science research program intended to support projects that examine scientific questions relating to the development of generic combination products and their associated regulatory review. Several research examples are described within this article, which demonstrate how equivalence can be evaluated when the function of the device could potentially impact drug delivery. Moreover, this article provides an overview of regulatory recommendations and ongoing scientific research efforts to further develop guidances and ultimately improve public access to generic combination products.

   Sterilization techniques for implantable medical devices
ID MICROWAVE
AB This review article is focused on the sterilization techniques used for polymer-based implantable medical devices as well as the regulatory aspects governing sterile medical devices. Polymeric materials are increasingly used in implantable devices due to their biodegradable and biocompatible nature. Patients and medical staff often prefer long-term implantable devices and these can be achieved using high molecular weight polymers. Sterilization of polymer-based implantable devices is critical. Since all implantable devices must be sterile, the effect of the sterilization method on the different device components (such as, the polymer, the drug, the electronics, etc.) has to be considered. A comprehensive summary of the established sterilization methods is provided along with the possible effects on polymers. In addition, novel sterilization methods are also discussed.

AB Sludge pumps in wastewater treatment plants are often oversized due to uncertainty in calculation of pressure drop. This issue costs millions of dollars for industry to purchase and operate the oversized pumps. Besides costs, higher electricity consumption is associated with extra CO2 emission which creates huge environmental impacts. Calculation of pressure drop via current pipe flow theory requires model estimation of flow curve data which depends on regression analysis and also varies with natural variation of rheological data. This study investigates impact of variation of rheological data and regression analysis on variation of pressure drop calculated via current pipe flow theories.& para;& para;Results compare the variation of calculated pressure drop between different models and regression methods and suggest on the suitability of each method.

AB Anthropogenically released radioactive cesium (RCs) poses serious ecological and environmental concerns given its persistency in the environment. Although accumulation of RCs in aqueous and sedimentary environments is often reported to associate with organic matter (OM), the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Here, we investigated RCs in fine sediments along the Abukuma River, the largest river near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, 1.5-4 years after the accident. Measuring the density-separated sediment fractions with a broad range of OM content (%) indicated that the RCs concentration (Bq.kg(-1)) is positively correlated with OM content for intermediate-density fractions in which OM is primarily characterized by autochthonous origin. This relationship, however, did not hold for light-density fractions containing a high proportion of large-size allochthonous OM. Furthermore, H2O2-assisted OM digestion and amorphous material dissolution treatments resulted in only a minor reduction in sedimentary RCs. These results along with the fact that sediments with high autochthonous OM content showed high specific surface area indicated that RCs is tightly associated with finer-grained and chemically non-labile inorganic fractions concurrently resident with autochthonous OM. Overall, our findings highlight that autochthonous OM exerts a significant control on the accumulation, transport, and fate of RCs in aqueous and sedimentary environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vast numbers of xenobiotics are known still to be present in treated municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Some of these possess endocrine-disrupting potency and pose risks for exposed aquatic animals. We searched for 17 potential environmental contaminants having affinity to the progesterone receptor. Relative potency values of these progesterone receptor-active chemicals were obtained. On the basis of relative potencies and measured environmental concentrations, the contribution of progestins to measured progestagenic activities was evaluated. Wastewaters (influent and effluent) and surrounding surface waters (upstream and downstream) at six municipal WWTPs were screened using instrumental chemical analysis and in vitro reporter gene bioassay. We showed the presence of target compounds and (anti-)progestagenic activities in municipal wastewater and surface water. Nine and seven progestins were identified in influent and effluent wastewaters, respectively. Only two compounds, progesterone and medroxyprogesterone were found in surface waters. Progestagenic agonistic activities in influents were partially masked by strong anti-progestagenic activities that were detected in all influents and ranged from 2.63 to 83 ng/L of mifepristone equivalents (EQs). Progestagenic activities were detected in all effluents and ranged from 0.06 to 0.47 ng/L of reference compound ORG 2058 EQs (a synthetic progestin equivalents), thus indicating incomplete removal of progestins during wastewater treatment processing. This activity poses a continuing risk for the aquatic environment. By contrast, anti-progestagenic activities showed better removal efficiency in WWTPs compared to progestagenic agonistic activities. Anti-progestagenic activities were found in only three of six effluents and ranged from 0.26 to 2.1 ng/L mifepristone EQs. We explained most of the progestagenic activity in municipal WWTP effluents by the presence of synthetic progestins and progesterone, which contributed 65-96% of such activity in samples where no antagonistic activity was found. The progestins medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate and progesterone contributed most to the progestagenic activity detected in municipal effluents. Anti-progestagenic activities were found in some municipal effluents, but no causative agents were revealed because two analysed selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) with anti-progestagenic activities, mifepristone and ulipristal acetate, were not present in the effluents.

AB Given the increasing vulnerability of communities to the negative impacts of untreated wastewater, resource recovery (RR) systems provide a paradigm shift away from a traditional approach of waste separation and treatment towards a productive recovery of water, energy and nutrients. The aim of this research is to understand the relationships between factors that influence the adoption and sustainability of wastewater-based RR systems to inform technology implementation strategies. The study presents a theory-informed, community-influenced system dynamics (SD) model to provide decision-makers with an adaptable tool that simulates system-level responses to the strategies that are developed for the coastal town of Placencia, Belize. The modeling framework is informed by literature-based theories such as the theory of diffusion of innovations (TDI) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Various methods, including surveys, interviews, participatory observations, and a water constituents mass balance analysis are used to validate relationships and numerically populate the model. The SD model was evaluated with field data and simulated to identify strategies that will improve the adoption and sustainability of RR systems. Site demonstrations (marketing strategy) made a significant impact on the stock of adopted RR systems. The stock of sustained RR systems is driven by the sustainability rate (i.e. economic and environmental viability) which can be improved by more site demonstrations and tank options (technical strategy). These strategies, however, only contributed to incremental improvements in the system's sustainability performance. This study shows that changing community behaviors (i.e. reporting the correct number of users and reclaiming resources), represented by structural change in the SD model, is the more significant way to influence the sustainable management of the community's wastewater resources.

AB The impact of nitrogen on biological performance and sludge filterability of anaerobic membrane bioreactors was investigated in two lab-scale cross-flow anaerobic membrane bioreactors that were fed with cheese whey at two different COD:TKN ratios (50 and 190). Nitrogen deprivation adversely affected the biological treatment performance and reactor stability, as indicated by volatile fatty acids accumulation. On the other hand, nitrogen (urea) supplementation resulted in a reduced sludge median particle size and decreased sludge filterability. Standard filterability parameters such as capillary suction time and specific resistance to filtration tended to rapidly increase in the nitrogen supplemented reactor. The critical fluxes in the nitrogen limited and supplemented reactors were 20 and 9 L m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The rapid deterioration of sludge filterability under nitrogen supplemented conditions was attributed to abundant growth of dispersed biomass. Thus, the COD:TKN ratio of wastewater affected both bioconversion and filterability performance in the anaerobic membrane bioreactors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gas-permeable membranes coupled with low-rate aeration is useful to recover ammonia (NH4+) from livestock effluents. In this study, the role of inorganic carbon (bicarbonate, HCO3-) to enhance the N recovery process was evaluated using synthetic effluents with various NH4+ to HCO3- molar ratios of 0.5, 1.0,1.5 and 2.0. The study also evaluated the effect of increased organic matter on the NH4+ recovery using humic acids (3000-6000 mg L-1), and the N recovery from high-strength swine manure. The release of hydroxide from the HCO3- with aeration increased the wastewater pH and promoted gaseous ammonia formation and membrane uptake. At the same time, the recovery of gaseous ammonia (NH3) through the membrane acidified the wastewater. Therefore, an abundant inorganic carbon supply in balance with the NH4+ is needed for a successful operation of the technology. NH4+ removal efficiencies >96% were obtained with NH4+ to HCO3- ratios <= 1. However, higher molar ratios inhibited the N recovery process resulting in lower efficiencies (<65%). Fortunately, most swine manures contain ample supply of endogenous inorganic carbon and the process can be used to more economically recover the ammonia using the natural inorganic carbon instead of expensive alkali chemicals. In 4 days, the recovered NH4+ from swine manure contained 48,000 mg L-1. Finally, it was found the process was not inhibited by the increasing levels of organic matter in the wastewater evaluated.

AB This study seeks to understand the general distribution of virome abundance and diversity in tropical freshwater ecosystems in Singapore and the geospatial distribution of the virome under different landuse patterns. Correlations between diversity, environmental parameters and land use patterns were analyzed and significant correlations were highlighted. Overall, the majority (65.5%) of the annotated virome belonged to bacteriophages. The percentage of Caudovirales was higher in reservoirs whereas the percentages of Dicistroviridae, Microviridae and Circoviridae were higher in tributaries. Reservoirs showed a higher Shannon-index virome diversity compared to upstream tributaries. Land use (urbanized, agriculture and parkland areas) influenced the characteristics of the virome distribution pattern. Dictstroviridae and Microviridae were enriched in urbanized tributaries while Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae were enriched in parkland reservoirs. Several sequences closely related to the emerging zoonotic virus, cyclovirus, and the human-related virus (human picobirnavirus), were also detected. In addition, the relative abundance of PMMoV (pepper mild mottle virus) sequences was significantly correlated with RT-qPCR measurements (0.588 < r < 0.879, p < 0.05). This study shows that spatial factors (e.g., reservoirs/tributaries, land use) are the main drivers of the viral community structure in tropical freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Waterborne, food-borne and sewage-borne pathogens are a major global concern, with the annual recurrence, most notably during the summer, of outbreaks of gastroenteritis of unconfirmed etiology associated with recreational activities in marine environments. The consumption of contaminated water-based foodstuffs is also related to outbreaks of human illness. The main goals of the present study were: i) to identify the genetic assemblages of Giardia duodenalis cysts in growing and depurated oysters destined for human consumption on the southern coast of Sao Paulo, Brazil; ii) to verify the main circulating G. duodenalis assemblages and their subtypes in different brackish waters used for the production of mollusks and for recreational purposes; iii) to track the contamination of growing and depurated oysters by the human adenovirus and identify the infectivity of adenoviral particles recovered from oysters before and after depuration; iv) to evaluate the occurrence and genotype of the free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba in brackish water and oysters from all the sites described above. Four sampling sites in the Cananeia estuary were selected to search for pathogenic and amphizoic protozoa (Giardia and Acanthamoeba respectively): site 1: oyster growth, site 2: catchment water (before UV depuration procedure), site 3: filter backwash (filtration stage of water treatment) and site 4: oyster depuration tank. Oysters at sites 1 and 4 were evaluated for the presence of adenovirus (HAdV). Analysis consisted of conventional microbiological as well as molecular methods. Giardia duodenalis were detected in all the water sites analyzed and the molecular analysis revealed that sub-assemblage All was the most frequently distributed throughout the estuarine environment, although one sample was identified as belonging to the assemblage C. Acanthamoeba were also isolated from different locations of the estuarine area, and were detected at all the analyzed sites. The majority of isolates belonged to the T3 genotype, while the T4 genotype was identified once. The sequencing reaction of Giardia duodenalis revealed the contamination of three batches of depurated oysters by the sub-assemblage All. With respect to viruses, seven batches of oysters (four growing and three depurated) were found to be harboring infectious HAdV particles when submitted to plaque assay. Overall, the results of the sequencing reactions combined with the plaque assay revealed that the isolates of Giardia duodenalis and the infectious HAdV particles identified in oyster tissues have the potential to infect humans and pose a threat if consumed raw or lightly cooked. This is the first report on the sub-assemblage All identified in oysters which are submitted to a cleaning and disinfection procedure prior to human consumption in Brazil. Acanthamoeba specific genotypes were also identified for the first time in a recreational estuarine area in Brazil, contributing to knowledge of their molecular and environmental epidemiology, which is considered scarce even in marine and estuarine areas of the world.

AB Laboratory-scale incubation experiments in water/sediment systems were conducted to test the transformation behavior of the anticonvulsant gabapentin (GBP) under different environmental conditions (aerobic, anaerobic, with abiotic controls). GBP was transformed by biological processes as it was eliminated quickly under aerobic conditions (dissipation time 50% of initial concentration (DT50): 2-7 days) whereas no decrease was observed under anaerobic conditions. Measurements via high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap-MS) revealed eight biological transformation products (TPs). Three of them were identified with reference standards (GBP-Lactam, TP186, TP213), while for the other five TPs tentative structures were proposed from information by MS2/MS3 experiments. Furthermore, the quantitatively most relevant TP GBP-Lactam was formed via intramolecular amidation (up to 18% of initial GBP concentration). Incubation experiments with GBP-Lactam revealed a higher stability against biotic degradation (DT50: 12 days) in contrast to GBP, while it was stable under anaerobic and abiotic conditions. Besides GBP, GBP-Lactam was detected in surface water in the mu g L-1 range. Finally, GBP and GBP-Lactam were found in potable water with concentrations up to 0.64 and 0.07 mu g L-1, respectively. According to the elevated environmental persistence of GBP-Lactam compared to GBP and its presumed enhanced toxicity, we recommend to involve GBP-Lactam into monitoring programs.

AB Constructed stormwater wetlands provide a host of ecosystem services, including potentially pathogen removal. We present results from a multi-wetland study that integrates across weather, chemical, microbiological and engineering design variables in order to identify patterns of microbial contaminant removal from inlet to outlet within wetlands and key drivers of those patterns. One or more microbial contaminants were detected at the inlet of each stormwater wetland (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus > Bacteroides HF183 > adenovirus). Bacteroides HF183 and adenovirus concentrations declined from inlet to outlet at all wetlands. However, co-removal of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria only occurred at wetlands where microbial assemblages at the inlet (dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes) were largely displaced by indigenous autotrophic microbial communities at the outlet (dominated by Cyanobacteria). Microbial community transitions (characterized using pyrosequencing) were well approximated by a combination of two rapid indicators: (1) fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and (2) chlorophyll a or phaeophytin a fluorescence. Within-wetland treatment of fecal markers and indicators was not strongly correlated with the catchment-to-wetland area ratio, but was diminished in older wetlands, which may point to a need for more frequent maintenance.

AB The widespread use of pharmaceuticals by human populations results in their sustained discharge to surface waters via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, 16 highly prescribed pharmaceuticals were quantified along a 250 km transect of the Hudson River Estuary and New York Harbor to describe their sources and spatial patterns. Sampling was conducted over two dry weather periods in May and July 2016, at 72 sites which included mid-channel and nearshore sites, as well as locations influenced by tributaries and WWTP outfalls. The detection frequency of the study pharmaceuticals was almost identical between the May and July sampling periods at 55% and 52%, respectively. Six pharmaceuticals were measurable at 92% or more of the sites during both sampling periods, illustrating their ubiquitous presence throughout the study area. Individual pharmaceutical concentrations were highly variable spatially, ranging from non-detect to 3810 ng/L. during the study. Major factors controlling concentrations were proximity and magnitude of WWTP discharges, inputs from tributaries and tidal mixing. Two compounds, sucralose and caffeine, were evaluated as tracers to identify wastewater sources and assess pharmaceutical behavior. Sucralose was useful in identifying wastewater inputs to the river and concentrations showed excellent correlations with numerous pharmaceuticals in the study. Caffeine-sucralose ratios showed potential in identifying discharges of untreated wastewater occurring during a combined sewage overflow event Many of the study pharmaceuticals were present throughout the Hudson River Estuary as a consequence of sustained wastewater discharge. Whereas some concentrations were above published effects levels, a more complete risk assessment is needed to understand the potential for ecological impacts due to pharmaceuticals in the Hudson River Estuary.

AB Nitrogen (N) transport from land to water is a dominant contributor of N in estuarine waters leading to eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia. Our objectives were to (1) investigate the composition of inorganic and organic N forms, (2) distinguish the sources and biogeochemical mechanisms of nitrate-N (NO3-N) transport using stable isotopes of NO3- and Bayesian mixing model, and (3) determine the dissolved organic N (DON) bioavailability using bioassays in a longitudinal gradient from freshwater to estuarine ecosystem located in the Tampa Bay, Florida, United States. We found that DON was the most dominant N form (mean: 64%, range: 46-83%) followed by particulate organic N (PON, mean: 22%, range: 14-37%), whereas inorganic N forms (NOx-N: 7%, NH4-N: 7%) were 14% of total N in freshwater and estuarine waters. Stable isotope data of NO3- revealed that nitrification was the main contributor (36.4%), followed by soil and organic N sources (25.5%), NO3- fertilizers (22.4%), and NH4+ fertilizers (15.7%). Bioassays showed that 14 to 65% of DON concentrations decreased after 5-days of incubation indicating utilization of DON by microbes in freshwater and estuarine waters. These results suggest that despite low proportion of inorganic N forms, the higher concentrations and bioavailability of DON can be a potential source of N for algae and bacteria leading to water quality degradation in the estuarine waters.

AB We employed synchrotron infrared (IR) mapping to resolve forward osmosis (FO) membrane fouling in osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR). Synchrotron IR mapping offers a unique perspective to elucidate the fouling mechanisms and associated consequences in OMBR operation. We demonstrated the spatial distribution and relative intensity of carbohydrate and protein longitudinally along of the fouled FO membrane at the conclusion of OMBR operation. Both transmission and attenuated total reflection (ATR) modes were used to map the cross-section and surface of the fouled FO membrane. Micro X-ray computed tomography revealed patchy, "sand-dune" features on the membrane surface at the conclusion of OMBR operation. Synchrotron IR-ATR mapping demonstrated that the development of membrane fouling layer in OMBR operation was initiated by polysaccharide-like carbohydrate, followed by layering with protein-like substance, resulting in a characteristic "sand-dune" three dimensional feature. Synchrotron FTIR mapping shed light on foulant occurrence and accumulation in the draw solution. Strong penetration of protein-like substance into membrane matrix was visualised, resulting the detection of protein adsorption in the region of membrane supporting layer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Water sensitive interventions are being promoted to reduce the adverse impacts of urban development on natural water cycles. However it is currently difficult to know the best strategy for their implementation because current and desired urban water performance is not well quantified. This is particularly at the city-region scale, which is important for strategic urban planning. This work aimed to fill this gap by quantifying the water performance of urban systems within city-regions using 'urban water metabolism' evaluation, to inform decisions about water sensitive interventions. To do this we adapted an existing evaluation framework with new methods. In particular, we used land use data for defining system boundaries, and for estimating natural hydrological flows. The criteria for gauging the water performance were water efficiency (in terms of water extracted externally) and hydrological performance (how much natural hydrological flows have changed relative to a nominated pre-urbanised state). We compared these performance criteria for urban systems within three Australian city-regions (South East Queensland, Melbourne and Perth metropolitan areas), under current conditions, and after implementation of example water sensitive interventions (demand management, rainwater/stormwater harvesting, wastewater recycling and increasing perviousness). The respective water efficiencies were found to be 79, 90 and 133 kL/capita/yr. In relation to hydrological performance, stormwater runoff relative to pre-urbanised flows was of most note, estimated to be 2-, 6- and 3- fold, respectively. The estimated performance benefits from water sensitive interventions suggested different priorities for each region, and that combined implementation of a range of interventions may be necessary to make substantive gains in performance. We concluded that the framework is suited to initial screening of the type and scale of water sensitive interventions needed to achieve desired water performance objectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Viscosity of Fe85-x(C1B11Si2P3)((15+x)/17) (x= 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8) alloy melts has been investigated in the temperature range of 1200-1500 degrees C by the oscillating cup method. An anomalous viscosity decrease for Fe85-x(C1B11Si2P3)((15+x)/17) alloy melts near 1350-1400 degrees C has been demonstrated in the heating process, and viscosity hysteresis in subsequent cooling process has been observed. The above phenomena are explained by the evolution of cluster in melts. The relationship between viscosity and temperature during cooling processes is well described by the Arrhenius equation. The viscosity almost increases with the increasing total metalloid content at different temperatures. The activation energy calculated by the Arrhenius equation has shown an evident minimum at x = 4, which is supposed to be close to the eutectic composition. The thermal results further confirm the eutectic composition.

AB In this research, the melt-quenching method was used to synthesize a series of zinc tellurite glass systems doped with erbium oxide with the chemical composition of [(TeO2)(0.7) (ZnO)(0.3)](1-x) (Er2O3)(x) at different molar fraction, x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, density, molar volume, elastic and optical measurements were used to characterize the prepared glass samples. At room temperature, the result of the XRD, FTIR, density, elastic and optical properties were all recorded. An amorphous nature of glass samples is proven by the XRD spectra. The analysis of FTIR spectra shows the presence of functional vibration of tellurite network. It is observed that the density of the glass system increase with the molar fraction of Er2O3. The value of molar volume is found to be directly proportional to the density. Thus, the increment in the density value causes the increment of the molar volume due to the increase of erbium concentration. This in turn results in the creation of excess free volume due to the difference of atomic radius between erbium and tellurite. On the other hand, ultrasonic velocity was used to determine the elastic moduli of the glass systems. The elastic moduli such as longitudinal modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus and Young's modulus give a fluctuating trend against the concentration of Er2O3. The increase of the elastic moduli is due to the mix former effect. In contrast, the decrease of the elastic moduli is due to the breakdown of Er2O3 in the zinc tellurite glass system which weakens the glass structure of the ternary tellurite system. The optical properties of the prepared glasses were determined by UV vis analysis. The optical absorption was recorded at room temperature in the wavelength ranging from 220 nm to 800 nm. The optical absorption spectra reveal that fundamental absorption edge shifts to higher wavelength as the content of erbium oxide increase. The values of direct and indirect band gap have been calculated and are observed to decrease with the increase content of erbium oxide. However, the Urbach energy, refractive index, molar refraction and electronic polarizability are shown to be increased with an addition content of erbium oxides.

AB The structure of bulk glasses of xIn(2)O(3)-(50-x)CaO-50P(2)O(5) system was studied. A structural model was proposed based on a detailed analysis of both Raman and P-31 MAS NMR spectra and along with the results of an X-ray analysis. This model is based on the idea of chemical compounds as components having the lowest Gibbs energy and being therefore the most stable. Chemical compounds used by the model: Ca(PO3)(2), Ca2P2O7, In(PO3)(3), In-4(P2O7)(3), CaIn2(P2O7)(2) and InPO4 were proposed on a common basis of the chemical composition and the experimental results. The model demonstrates that the equilibria in the glass-forming melts maintains a mean coordination of cations of practically four across the entire range of the glass-forming region, and that with an increasing concentration of indium, the number of Me-O-P bonds increases by a quarter almost linearly. The validity of the model was verified by experimentally obtained compositional dependencies density, molar volume, glass transition temperature and thermal expansion coefficient.

AB Single-handed helical tantalum pentoxide nanotubes with inner chiral organic self-assemblies were prepared through a supramolecular templating approach. After carbonization and removal of tantalum pentoxide, single-handed twisted carbonaceous nanotubes were obtained. The handedness of the carbonaceous nanotubes followed that of the tantalum pentoxide nanotubes. The carbonaceous nanotubes were formed due to the adsorption of the organic self-assemblies on the inner surfaces of the tantalum pentoxide nanotubes and the shrinkage of organic self-assemblies during the drying process and subsequently carbonization. The X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy characterizations indicated that the carbon was amorphous. The circular dichroism spectra indicated that the twisted carbonaceous nanotubes exhibited optical activity. The elemental analysis showed that these carbonaceous nanotubes were N-doped. These N-doped carbonaceous materials might find applications as catalysts and chirality sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reduced catalysts were tested in low temperature steam reforming of model propane-methane mixture into methane-rich gas. The catalysts were compared with industrial samples and exhibited appropriate activity which increased in the following order: Industrial CH4 reforming catalyst < Ni-CeO2-Al2O3 approximate to Ni-Cr2O3-Al2O3 approximate to Ni-Al2O3 < Ni-MgO-Al2O3 approximate to Industrial CO and CO2 methanation catalyst. Ni-MgO-Al2O3 catalyst with lower Ni content and higher calcination and reduction temperatures showed activity close to that of industrial methanation catalyst. The effect was attributed to Ni-MgO interaction which resulted in higher Ni dispersion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The optical properties of iridescent nanostructures which were found in butterfly scales were investigated under varied temperature. An amazing hierarchical nanostructure with high thermal stability was revealed for the application of bio-inspired optical materials. Relationship between thermal dilation and light reflectance of the typical iridescent nanostructures including the ridge-specialized and body-lamellae structure were carefully studied by experimental tests and computer simulation. Results of experimental tests showed the light reflectance of the body-lamellae nanostructure performed more stable. Finite element methods and FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) solutions revealed the effect of thermal dilation and structural parameters on light reflectance. The results guided the design of future optical sensing materials with a high thermo-optic stable nanostructure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a promising color converter in warm white LEDs, phosphors-in-glass (PiG) thick film is still suffering from the deficiency of high-efficient red phosphors. Herein, commercial Ce3+:Y3Al5O12 and/or Eu2+:Sr2Si5N8 phosphors were successfully embedded into a phosphate glass matrix coated on a soda-lime-silicate glass substrate. Their structural and luminescent properties were respectively investigated by XRD, SEM and photoluminescence spectra analysis. Color-tunable emission was achieved by varying the weight ratio of red to yellow phosphors. After fabricating LED devices with the optimal sample, considerable luminous performance was achieved with luminous efficacy of 72.1 lm/W, correlated color temperature of 5612 K and color rendering index Ra of 82.5. It suggested that the Ce3+:Y3Al5O12/Eu2+:Sr2Si5N8 PiG thick film exhibits a significant potential for high-power warm white LEDs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The performance of photo detectors was explored under 670 nm laser of power intensity 3 mW/cm(2) at 1 mV bias. The typical detector parameters such as responsivity, external quantum efficiency and detectivity were determined. The enhanced photodetection with significantly improved responsivity and fast response time of 600 ms is achieved by alloy engineering in VxSn1-xSe2 (x = 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.5) ternary alloy. This study can open a new pathway to tune the properties, important for producing tuneable high performance electronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter, we repot a new radio-photoluminescence (RPL) material. The RPL was observed non-doped Li2CO3 ceramics sintered in vacuum. Under 340 +/- 40 nm excitation, a photoluminescence (PL) emission peak appeared around 470 nm, the intensity of which increases with X-ray irradiation dose. The RPL signal was very sensitive to X-ray dose, and the response signal was measurable as low as 0.1 mGy although the synthesis and measurement set-up were not optimized. This sensitivity is equivalent to that of commercial RPL dosimeters. In addition, the effective atomic number of Li2CO3 (Z(eff) = 7.32) is closer to that of biological tissue than any other dosimeter materials used in practice. From these reasons, we believe that this material should be a promising candidate for RPL dosimeters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Graphene; Friction; Atomic force microscopy; Substrate-regulation
AB In the present study, nanotribological measurements were performed via atomic force microscopy on Si/SiO2-supported graphene monolayers with varying oxide layer thicknesses. The observations uncovered significant discrepancies in resulting friction forces between each graphene sample. Nanoscale interfacial friction forces were observed to increase from similar to 0.49 nN to similar to 1.00 nN when the oxide layer thickness was increased from 90 nm to 300 nm. The findings were determined to be the result of increased phonon scattering which is responsible for the removal of the vibrational reduction of nanoscale friction. Such discrepancies in friction forces points toward the potential tunability of nanoscale friction in supported graphene. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of molar mass and temperature on the rheological properties of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) melts was investigated by dynamical mechanical and creep-recovery experiments. The results shown that the steady state viscosities obtained from both experimental modes were in good agreement, and a well linear relationship between the activation energy and molar mass was obtained. The creep compliance of PMMA increased with the molar mass increased or temperature decreased, while the linear steady state recoverable compliance was found to be independent of the molar mass and temperature. Moreover, it was found that the master curves followed the time-temperature superposition principle well in the whole frequency range or time scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Tb3-xCexAl5O12 (TAG:Ce) phosphors with various cerium doped concentrations were successfully prepared via molten salt (MS) synthesis method using the eutectic mixtures of NaNO2-KNO2 as the flux. Tb3Al5O12 phase can be formed at a temperature as low as 450 degrees C, but the as-prepared TAG:Ce phosphor with a 250 nm average particle size do not have noticeable emission and excitation spectra. However, after being annealed in a reducing atmosphere at 1100 degrees C, the phosphor was found to have the same particle size, and more importantly, stronger emission and excitation spectra as well. The results show that the modified MS method provides a feasible approach to produce TAG:Ce phosphor for optoelectronic applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The depressing texturation and stubborn directional saw marks on diamond wire sawing (DWS) polysilicon wafers has resulted in severe limitations for the mass application of DWS technology in PV market. Herein, a simple and low-cost copper-assisted chemical etching method was presented to controllably nano-texturing DWS polysilicon wafers. The work firstly reveals the adjustment of anion species in copper salts can readily control the nanostructure during the copper-catalyzed etching process. After etching, the obtained inverted pyramid structure can effectively reduce the reflectivity of the silicon wafer surface, the reflectance can be as low as 5.8% in the wavelength range of 300-1100 nm. Moreover, the surface saw marks are removed after etching, and the novel texture method guarantee the low recombination rates. The effective texturing method shows a promising potential application in the photovoltaic field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The synthesis of bismuth titanate Bi4Ti3O12 (BiT) is performed via a novel solid state reaction. The reaction is designed to control the stoichiometric content of the highly volatile element, i.e. Bi. The chemical route consists in trapping bismuth oxide colloids in a stabilized titanium based sol gel solution. The resulting colloidal-solution hybrid ink can be processed via various ceramic processes. After gelation of TiO2 in the sol-gel component the mixture reacts at high temperature (850 degrees C) to yield the BiT phase. The obtained material is c-axis oriented, and its lattice parameters, shrinkage and density matches the pure Bi4Ti3O12 phase. The sintered material exhibits enhanced higher dielectric constant (2 3 2) than usually reported for this phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 (CIGS) is a p-type semiconductor material and an attractive absorber for thin films solar cells due to its unique optical and electrical properties. The low cost of this technology is based on its application on ecological substrates (glass, ceramic or glass-ceramic materials), effective uses of raw materials and lower thickness of the film (range from 1.5 to 3 mu m). In this work, a new glass-ceramic substrate has been developed using industrial wastes materials (recycled glass, bottom ash and fly ash from a thermal power plant) used as support in thin film solar cell technology. The CIGS absorber has been synthesized by an easy and low-cost way of preparation using the co-precipitation method. The solar cell device has been completed and fully characterized. The obtained films were characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electrical characterization. The short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and total area power conversion efficiency (eta) of the device are 8,11 mA/cm(2), 168,2 mV, 27,6% and 0,4% respectively.

AB The investigation of unique sizes and shapes as they relate to various properties has become a great study for large field applications. Polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ) particles are produced by electrospraying. Morphology of the electrosprayed particles develops from the needle-like to star-like particles by controlling the concentration of the polymer solution. Therefore, electrospraying process instead of conventional methods has opened up an alternative for the fabrication of particles by controlling with three main parameters (applied voltage, flow rate and concentration of the polymer) that are used to manipulate their morphologies during preparation.

AB Ordered cubic smaller supermicroporous mesoporous silica has been successfully prepared using ionic liquid as template in acidic condition, where ionic liquid were produced from 1-dodecyl bromide and 1-methylimidazole (I-12). Most importantly, MS-I-12 exhibits two obvious pore size distribution at 1.7 nm attributed to supermicropores and 0.64 nm associated with micropores. Our present work is of importance because it not only provides a new methodology to synthesize supermicroporous mesoporous materials, but also opens a door for preparation of mesoporous silica with micropores.

TI Gradient wetting state for droplet transportation and efficient fog
   harvest on nanopillared cicada wing surface
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Cicada wing; Gradient wetting state; Fog harvesting; Nanostructured
   surface; Biomimetic; Functionality
AB As a result of natural selection, cicadas can easily remove water droplets, pollen or dust from their wing surface. A gradient wetting state along the wing veins is revealed for the first time in this work. That is, the Wenzel state (hydrophilic) is transitioned to the Cassie-Baxter state (superhydrophobic) from foot to apex of the wing, which is attributed to different radius, height, and gap of the nanopillars on its surface. A fog harvesting test demonstrates that the cicada wing has a remarkable fog harvesting efficiency of 6.6 g m(-2) s(-1), which is comparable to the values reported for representative plant and animal surfaces. Superhydrophobic region exhibits a lower adhesion force to the droplets than hydrophilic region. So the accumulated droplets easily roll off from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic regions, and the light weight state on the wing can be maintained under its slight shaking. This work may direct the design of gradient wetting surfaces by mimicking the nanopillar structure on cicada wing and explore potential application in water harvesting. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
