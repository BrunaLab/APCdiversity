AB Eimeria infections are common in sheep industry worldwide nonetheless very little is known on infection dynamics and associated risk factors influencing the outcome of clinical ovine coccidiosis. The aim of the present work was to analyse intrinsic (e.g. host age) and extrinsic (flock size, farm size and animal density) risk factors influencing dynamics of Eimeria spp. infections in sheep farms of the semi-arid region of Murcia in southern Spain. Overall, 64 ovine flocks in Murcia were surveyed and a total of 396 faecal samples were collected between May and July 2015. Flotation and McMaster techniques were performed for parasitological investigation. Excreted oocysts were identified on the basis of morphological as well as morphometric characteristics. In all analysed samples Eimeria spp. oocysts (100%) were found and 11 different Eimeria species were identified. Most prevalent species was E. ovinoidalis (97%) followed by E. parva/E.pallida (97%), E. weybridgensis (90.9%) and E. crandallis (89.4%), respectively. Concomitant infections with more than one Eimeria species were observed in all analysed samples. Analysis of intrinsic/extrinsic risk factor revealed age, herd/farm size and animal density to be the main factors significantly influencing Eimeria oocysts per gram of faeces counts (OPG) and overall prevalence of Eimeria spp. infections in sheep.

AB The present study aimed at analyzing the chemical composition and evaluating the in vitro and in vivo anthelmintic activity of Artemisia campestris essential oil aerial parts. The chemical composition was analysed by gaz chromatography/mass chromatography (GC/MS). Fifty compounds were identified representing 99.98% of the total oil. A. campestris essential oil was dominated by beta-pinene (36.40%) and 2-undecanone (14.7%).
   The in vitro anthelmintic activity tests of A. campestris essential oil were performed on Haemonchus contortus using egg hatch assay (EHA) and adult worm's motility assay (AWMA) compared with a reference drug al- bendazole. In the EHA 100% inhibition was observed at 2 mg/ml after 48 h incubation (IC50 = 0.93 mg/ml). In the AWMA, essential oil induced 66.6% inhibition at 0.5 mg/ml after 8 h post exposure.
   The nematicidal effect of essential oil was evaluated on Heligmosomoides polygyrus. It was monitored through faecal egg count reduction (FECR) and total worm count reduction (TWCR). Three doses (2000, 4000 and 5000 mg/kg) were studied using a bioassay. The dose of 5000 mg/kg showed a high nematicidal activity (72.1% FECR and 72% TWCR), 7 days post-treatment. The results of the present study suggest that A. campestris essential oil has a potential anthelmintic activity and further studies are required in order to establish its mechanisms of action.

AB This research assessed the dose/response to Duddingtonia flagrans chlamydospores (Df-C) administered to calves naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs), and its effect in reducing the infective larvae (L-3) population in faeces in a farm in the Mexican tropics. Forty zebu calves, between 6 and 12 months of age, were randomly distributed into four groups of 10 calves. One control and three groups treated with different oral doses of Df-C based on their body weight (BW) were established as follows: group 1 (control); group 2, 0.250 x 10(6) Df-C per kg/BW; group 3, 0.5 x 10(6) Df-C per kg/BW and group 4, 1 x 10(6) Df-C per kg/BW. The fungal doses were administered daily for 10 days. Every group was confined to individual pens, and they received a nutritional regime based on Buffel grass, concentrated supplement and water ad libitum. Every third day, starting one week before treatments, faeces were taken from the rectum of each animal to determine the number of eggs per g of faeces (epg) through the McMaster technique. Four coprocultures of 20 g each from each individual faecal sample were prepared and incubated for 14 days. The efficacy of the treatments was based on the mean of the GIN L-3 recovered from coprocultures of the different groups. Data were analysed using a completely randomized design through an ANOVA analysis, followed by a Duncan multiple range test. The efficacy of treatments was expressed as the larval reduction rate. High variation in the epg in the different groups along the experiment was recorded. The reduction in the GIN L-3 population was observed from the 4 to 11 day post-treatment in the three assessed doses. Results in group 2 (lowest fungal dose), showed 88.5, 57.6, 55.9 and 30% (58% overall reductions) in the GIN L-3 in the faeces of animals 4, 7, 9 and 11 days post-treatment, respectively. In group 3 (medium fungal dose), 95.8, 80.4, 63.4 and 52.7% GIN L-3 reductions (73% overall reduction) were recorded, respectively. At the highest Df-C dose used (1 x 10(6) per kg/BW), the results were 88.9, 78.0, 59.3 and 67.3% (73.5% overall reduction), respectively (p < 0.05). The species of identified nematodes through L-3 morphometric and molecular taxonomy were Cooperia spp. and H. contortus. From the three Df-C assessed doses, the medium dose (0.5 x 10(6) Df-C per kg/BW) was sufficient to substantially reduce the GIN L-3 in zebu calves maintained under conditions in the Mexican tropics.

AB Occurrence of residual endotoxin activity (ET) in dialysis water and also tap water as its source is a matter of great concern to medical professionals conducting dialysis therapy at healthcare facilities (HCFs). The present study was performed to determine the occurrence and fate of the ET at selected Japanese drinking water purification plants and HCFs between 2014 and 2016. Chemical coagulation and sedimentation, rapid sand filtration, and membrane filtration were highly effective to decrease both ET dissolved in water (free-ET) and ET bound to cells/particles (bound-ET). Moderate decreases in bound-ET and limited decreases in free-ET were observed by chlorination and ozonation. Bacterial activated carbon filtration was a major cause of significant increases in endotoxin activity during the course of drinking water purification process. Levels of residual ET in water supplied to HCFs were strongly affected by their source waters and the configurations of water purification processes served. Microbial regrowth on the premises, from water tanks to faucets at HCFs could also contribute to ET increases in tap water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) ubiquitously exists in natural waters and would adsorb onto the particle surface. Previous studies showed that NOM would alleviate the toxicity of nanomaterials, while the mechanism is seldom quantitatively interpreted. Herein, the effects of humic substances [Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA)) and biomacromolecules [alginate and bovine serum albumin (BSA)) on the aggregation and antimicrobial effects of silver sulfide nanoparticles (Ag2S-NPs) were investigated. The aggregation kinetics of Ag2S-NPs in electrolyte solutions were in agreement with the results based on Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) results showed that the SRFA, SRHA, alginate and BSA molecules coated on the Ag2S-NPs surfaces. The NOM coating layer prevented salt-induced coagulation of Ag2S-NPs, and the effects of BSA and SRHA on Ag2S-NPs stabilizing were more obvious than that of SRFA and alginate. Flow cytometry analysis results suggested that BSA and SRHA were more effective on alleviating the Ag2S-NPs induced cell (Escherichia coli) membrane damage than SRFA and alginate. After interpreting the electrophoretic mobility (EPM) data of the NOM coated Ag2S-NPs by Ohshima's soft particle theory, it was found that the thickness of the NOM coating layers followed the orders of BSA > SRHA > alginate > SRFA. The E.coli cell membrane damage level was negatively correlated with the thickness and softness of the coating layer. NOM coating may physically alleviate the contact between NPs and E. coli cells and thus attenuate the extent of cell membrane damage caused by the NP-cell interaction. This work provides a new perspective for quantitatively interpreting the influence of NOM on the environmental behaviors and risks of nanomaterials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coupling in situ thermal treatment (ISTT) with microbial reductive dechlorination (MRD) has the potential to enhance contaminant degradation and reduce cleanup costs compared to conventional standalone remediation technologies. Impacts of low-temperature ISTT on Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc), a relevant species in the anaerobic degradation of cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) to nontoxic ethene, were assessed in sand-packed columns under dynamic flow conditions. Dissolved tetrachloroethene (PCE; 258 +/- 46 mu M) was introduced to identical columns bioaugmented with the PCE-to-ethene dechlorinating consortium KB-1 (R). Initial column temperatures represented a typical aquifer (15 degrees C) or a site undergoing low-temperature MT (35 degrees C), and were subsequently increased to 35 and 74 degrees C, respectively, to assess temperature impacts on reductive dechlorination activity. In the 15 degrees C column, PCE was transformed primarily to cis-DCE (159 +/- 2 mu M), which was further degraded to VC (164 +/- 3 mu M) and ethene (30 +/- 0 mu M) within 17 pore volumes (PVs) after the temperature was increased to 35 degrees C. Regardless of the initial column temperature, ethene constituted >50 mol% of effluent degradation products in both columns after 73-74 PVs at 35 degrees C, indicating that MRD performance was greatly improved under low-temperature ISTT conditions. Increasing the temperature of the column initially at 35 degrees C resulted in continued VC and ethene production until a temperature of approximately 43 degrees C was reached, at which point Dhc activity substantially decreased. The abundance of the vcrA reductive dehalogenase gene exceeded that of the bvcA gene by 1-2.5 orders of magnitude at 15 degrees C, but this relationship inversed at temperatures >35 degrees C, suggesting Dhc strain-specific responses to temperature. These findings demonstrate improved MRD performance with low-temperature thermal treatment and emphasize potential synergistic effects at sites undergoing ISTT. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB While cyanobacteria have been widely recognised as the most common cause of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol related taste and odour (T&O) episodes in drinking water supplies, many reported occurrences could not be attributed to these organisms. The Streptomyces genus of soil bacteria also includes producers of these compounds, however their potential role in such occurrences is poorly understood and often disregarded on the basis that they are terrestrial rather than aquatic organisms, with their detection in water samples assumed to reflect the presence of dormant spores rather than metabolically active vegetative cells. Using qPCR and a differential cell lysis technique for DNA extraction, allowing distinction of spores from vegetative cells, the aim of this study was to determine the distribution, abundance and potential activity of Streptomyces species across a range of aquatic and marginal habitat zones in two drinking water reservoirs, including: exposed soil, submerged sediments, plant debris and emergent macrophytes at the margins; marginal and offshore surface waters; deep offshore waters; and offshore benthic sediments. Marginal substrates including soil, sediment and plant debris were identified as the dominant habitat zones for Streptomyces, (concentrations up to 1.1 x 10(7) cells g(-1)) supporting the concept of 'wash-in' from the margins due to run-off or water level rise following rainfall, as the likely pathway for Streptomyces induced T&O in reservoirs. However, vegetative cells were also found to comprise a substantial proportion of Streptomyces populations in the reservoir water mass itself (>90% in some surface and bottom water samples), suggesting the potential for these bacteria to be metabolically active in the water and therefore contribute to in situ production of T&O metabolites.

AB Algal extracellular organic matter (EOM) released from Microcystis aeruginosa can cause severe membrane fouling during algae-laden water treatment. To solve this problem, three typical sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs), i.e., ferrous iron/peroxymonosulfate (Fe(II)/PMS), UV/PMS and UV/Fe(II)/PMS, were employed as membrane pretreatment strategies. Their performance on mitigating EOM fouling of a ceramic UF membrane was systematically investigated and compared in the present study. The results indicated that SR-AOPs pretreatments could promote the reduction of DOC and UV254, and the removal performance showed an apparent regularity of UV/Fe(II)/PMS > Fe(II)/PMS > UV/PMS. The pretreatments were very effective for decomposing high-MW biopolymers (>20,000 Da) into low-MW humic substances (1000-20,000 Da), thus reducing the accumulation of high-MW biopolymers on membrane surface. With respect to membrane fouling control, Fe(II)/PMS significantly mitigated both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling, whereas UV/PMS only reduced reversible fouling, and exhibited little effect on irreversible fouling. By contrast, UV/Fe(II)/PMS showed the best performance for fouling reduction due to the synergistic effect of UV and Fe(II) for PMS activation. The dominating fouling mechanism was governed by both pore blockage and cake filtration, likely due to the bimodal MW distribution of EOM, and SR-AOPs pretreatments delayed the transition from pore blockage to cake filtration. In addition, SR-AOPs prior to UF membrane were also very effective to improve the removal of micropollutants (i.e., ATZ, SMT and p-CNB). These results demonstrate the potential application of SR-AOPs as pretreatment for membrane fouling control during algae-laden water treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although fungi play important roles in biogeochemical cycling in aquatic ecosystems and have received a great deal of attention, much remains unknown about the living fractions of fungal communities in aquifers of the terrestrial subsurface in terms of diversity, community dynamics, functional roles, the impact of environmental factors and presence of fungal pathogens. Here we address this gap in knowledge by using RNA-based high throughput pair-end illumina sequencing analysis of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene markers, to target the living fractions of groundwater fungal communities from fractured alternating carbonate-/siliciclastic-rock aquifers of the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory. The probed levels of the hillslope multi-storey aquifer system differ primarily in their oxygen and nitrogen content due to their different connections to the surface. We discovered highly diverse living fungal communities (384 Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) with different taxonomic affiliations and ecological functions. The observed fungal communities primarily belonged to three phyla: Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Chytridiomycota. Perceived dynamics in the composition of living fungal communities were significantly shaped by the concentration of ammonium in the moderately agriculturally impacted aquifer system. Apart from fungal saprotrophs, we also detected living plant and animal pathogens for the first time in this aquifer system. This work also demonstrates that the RNA-based high throughput pair-end illumina sequencing method can be used in future for water quality monitoring in terms of living fungal load and subsequent risk assessments. In general, this study contributes towards the growing knowledge of aquatic fungi in terrestrial subsurface biogeosphere. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of gadolinium (Gd) complexes as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has resulted in point source releases of anthropogenic Gd into the environment and presents the opportunity to trace the fate of wastewater plumes. Here we collected seawater samples along the coast of Northeast Brazil to investigate the influence of two submarine sewage outfalls on the distribution of Gd and other rare earth elements (REE) in the coastal waters. The shale-normalized REEs only show a small light over heavy REE enrichment and negative Ce anomalies, likely reflecting the influence of freshwater inputs. Positive Gd anomalies are observed at most of the sampling sites, indicating the ubiquitous presence of anthropogenic Gd in coastal waters. The highest Gd anomalies are found in the vicinity of the submarine sewage outfalls and decrease with increasing distance from point source. The total daily discharge of 216 +/- 82 g Gd and 92.0 +/- 19.3 g Gd was calculated for the Rio Vermelho (ERV) and Boca do Rio (EBR) submarine outfalls, respectively, which on population bases equates to 11.5 +/- 4.3 g Gd d(-1) for ERV and 15.5 +/- 3.3 g Gd d(-1) for EBR per 100 000 persons. It is estimated that in 2016 the annual emission of anthropogenic Gd by hospitals and clinics in Brazil varied between 527 kg and 53 tons. It was roughly estimated that between 698 and 2021 g Gd d(-1) are discharged into the Tropical and South Atlantic waters due to submarine outfall sewage along the coast of Brazil.

AB Detecting disturbances in microbial communities is an important aspect of managing natural and engineered microbial communities. Here, we implemented a custom-built continuous staining device in combination with real-time flow cytometry (RT-FCM) data acquisition, which, combined with advanced FCM fingerprinting methods, presents a powerful new approach to track and quantify disturbances in aquatic microbial communities. Through this new approach we were able to resolve various natural community and single-species microbial contaminations in a flow-through drinking water reactor. Next to conventional FCM metrics, we applied metrics from a recently developed fingerprinting technique in order to gain additional insight into the microbial dynamics during these contamination events. Importantly, we found that multiple community FCM metrics based on different statistical approaches were required to fully characterize all contaminations. Furthermore we found that for accurate cell concentration measurements and accurate inference from the FCM metrics (coefficient of variation <= 5%), at least 1000 cells should be measured, which makes the achievable temporal resolution a function of the prevalent bacterial concentration in the system-of-interest. The integrated RT-FCM acquisition and analysis approach presented herein provides a considerable improvement in the temporal resolution by which microbial disturbances can be observed and simultaneously provides a multi-faceted toolset to characterize such disturbances.

AB To determine the priority hazard in drinking water, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) method was used to evaluate the disease burden induced by trihalomethanes (THMs) and low-level arsenic through multiple exposure routes based on the two-year sampling from drinking water in Xi'an city, Northwest China. The average concentrations of chloroform (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM), bromoform (TBM) and arsenic were 12.67 mu g/L, 1.42 mu g/L, 0.60 mu g/L, 0.13 mu g/L and 1.00 mu g/L, respectively, and the total lifetime cancer risks for all THMs and arsenic were 8.54 x 10(-6) and 4.02 x 10(-5), which were 8.54 and 40.2 times of the negligible risk level (1.00 x 10(-6)), respectively. The DALYs estimation showed that the total DALYs lost for all age groups was 32.62 person-year, and the average individual DALYs lost was 4.77 x 10(-6) per person-year (ppy), which was 4.77 times of the reference level (1.00 x 10(-6) ppy). About 72.07% of the total disease burden was due to arsenic, which was considered to be the priority hazard in Xi'an drinking water. The age group of 75-80 years was found to be most vulnerable to the induced cancer risk, and skin cancer had the highest disease burden (2.24 x 10(-6) ppy). Due to the relatively high incidence rates of lung cancer and skin cancer, most DALYs lost for males were 2-4 times to that for females in the same age group. Oral ingestion made the most contribution (88.58%) to the total disease burden, followed by inhalation of THMs (11.30%), whereas dermal absorption showed negligible risk (0.12%). As the first to compare the cancer risks of arsenic and THMs to the public in DALYs in China, this study might be useful for potential strategies of risk control and management of hazardous agents in drinking water.

AB After treated wastewater is discharged into surface water for unplanned indirect potable reuse, solar irradiation transforms the dissolved organic matter (DOM), which would alter the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and change the cytotoxicity formation potential (CtFP) during post-chlorination in drinking water treatment plants. This study investigated the effects of solar irradiation on the CtFP and total organic halogen formation potential (TOXFP) of wastewater during post-chlorination. Exposure to natural sunlight decreased the formation potential of cytotoxicity to Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Under 24 h simulated solar irradiation, CtFP and TOXFP decreased by more than 40%. X-ray photoelectron spectra and Fourier transformation infrared spectra suggested solar irradiation destroyed the key DBP precursors containing phenolic hydroxyl moieties (Ph-OH). The destruction of Ph-OH under solar irradiation was reflected by a decrease in the electron donating capacity (EDC) of DOM and the post-chlorination decreased the EDC further. Increasing the irradiation-consumed EDC abated the chlorine-consumed EDC, while the chlorine-consumed EDC was positively correlated to the CtFP and TOXFP by means of the electrophilic substitution-aromatic ring cleavage. Solar irradiation thus reduced the CtFP and TOXFP in wastewater during post-chlorination. This study revealed that solar irradiation decreased the risks of treated wastewater for unplanned indirect potable reuse and provided a strategy of controlling CtFP and TOXFP via reducing EDC of DOM in pretreatments.

AB Simultaneous sludge fermentation and nitrite removal is an effective approach to enhance nutrient removal from low carbon-wastewater. It was found in this work that the presence of nitrite largely promoted hydrogen production from acidic fermentation of waste activated sludge (WAS). The results showed that with an increase of nitrite from 0 to 250 mg/L, the maximal hydrogen yield increased from 8.5 to 15.0 mL/g VSS at pH 5.5 fermentation and 8.1-13.0 mL/g VSS at pH 6 fermentation. However, the maximal hydrogen yield from WAS fermentation at pH 8 remained almost constant (2.9-3.7 mL/g VSS) when nitrite was in the range of 0-250 mg/L. Further analyses revealed that free nitrous acid (FNA) rather than nitrite was the major contributor to the promotion of hydrogen yield. The mechanism investigations showed that FNA not only accelerated the disruption of sludge cells but also promoted the biodegradability of organics released, thereby provided more biodegradable substrates for subsequent hydrogen production. Although FNA inhibited activities of all microbes involved in the anaerobic fermentation, its inhibitions to hydrogen consumers were much severer than those to hydrolytic microorganisms and hydrogen producers. Further investigations with microbial community showed that FNA increased the abundances of hydrogen producers (e.g., Citrobacter sp.) and denitrifiers (e.g., Dechloromonas sp.), but reduced the abundances of hydrogen consumers (e.g., Clostridium_aceticum). This work demonstrated for the first time that FNA in WAS fermentation systems enhanced hydrogen production. The findings obtained expand the application field of FNA and may provide supports for sustainable operation of wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water reuse is of increasing relevance for water-stressed regions but is often considered a contentious option. Research has shown that providing the public with information about reuse options can impact positively on its acceptability, although such impacts can be confined to specific groups. In this context, there is growing interest in understanding the impact of different forms and mechanisms of communication with the public around reuse. This contribution has investigated the use of video animations to communicate the safety of non-potable recycled water schemes. The aim of this study was to evaluate how different ways of framing messages about the safety of recycled water might impact on public attitudes. Participants were recruited in London (n = 689), UK, and randomly allocated to test and control groups, with the former being exposed to one of four video animations that used different frames to convey messages about recycled water safety. Surveys collected pre- and post-video message responses for dependent variables including the general acceptance of diverse non-potable recycled water uses, risk perceptions and trust. The findings complement existing knowledge on the impacts of different types of messaging on public attitudes to reuse schemes with important evidence for the positive impact of water safety communications framed in terms of compliance with water quality requirements. Contrarily, a positive attitudinal impact was not evident for safety message framed in terms of the selection of water treatment technology to remove contaminants nor in terms of non-potable water risks relative to other every-day risks. The results are of value to water resource planners looking to develop communication resources, as part of more comprehensive public engagement strategies, for improving perceptions of water reuse. Importantly, the findings help isolate the effects of specific message frames, and inform the debate on whether an increased understanding of risk positively or negatively influences willingness to support water reuse schemes.

AB Abiotic mechanisms of oxytetracycline degradation by redox-active minerals, Fe(III)-saturated montmorillonite (Fe-SWy) and birnessite (delta-MnO2), were studied to better understand the environmental behavior of tetracycline antibiotics in aqueous systems. Kinetics of dissipation (adsorption, oxidation and formation of transformation products (TPs)), was investigated up to 7 days, and reaction mechanisms were elucidated based on identification of TPs by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Oxytetracycline was completely removed from solution by both minerals, however kinetics, TPs and mechanisms were distinct for each mineral. Oxytetracycline oxidation by delta-MnO2 occurred within minutes; 54 identified TPs were detected only in solution, most of them exhibited decreasing levels with time. In contrast, oxytetracycline was completely adsorbed by Fe-SWy, its degradation was slower, only 29 TPs were identified, among them 13 were surface-bound, and most of the TPs accumulated in the system with time. Oxytetracycline transformation by delta-MnO2 involved radicals, as was proven by electrochemical degradation. Reductive dissolution was observed for both minerals. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated accumulation of Fe(II) on Fe-SWy surface, whereas Mn(II) was primarily released from delta-MnO2 surface. Highly oxidized carbon species (i.e., newly formed TPs) were observed on the surface of both minerals interacting with oxytetracycline. This study demonstrates the impact of structure and reactivity of redox-active minerals on removal and decomposition of tetracycline antibiotics in aqueous systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Membrane fouling remains a major challenge for applying membrane technology to water treatment and, therefore, new tools to recognize the key foulants are essential for characterizing and evaluating the membrane fouling process. In this work, fluorescence excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor framework-clustering analysis was used to investigate the membrane fouling during the filtration process of humic acid (HA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution by polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Interestingly, the interaction between BSA and HA in the membrane fouling process was observed, and was further confirmed by infrared microspectroscopy and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopic analysis. In addition, the HA-induced membrane fouling was observed to be initially relieved, but became aggravated when a certain amount of BSA was added. Furthermore, with such an integrated approach, the O-H groups in HA and amide bands in BSA were found to be mainly responsible for the membrane fouling and the HA-BSA interaction was mainly caused by the encapsulation of BSA with HA. This work develops a new method for probing membrane fouling and demonstrates the interaction between membrane foulants and its roles in membrane fouling process. Furthermore, the integrated approach developed in this work has a potential to explore other types of interfacial interactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, water-based paint (WBP) wastewater was treated using a natural coagulant, Moringa oleifera aqueous extract (MOAE), fortified with Ca2+ (from nitrate and chloride salts). In order to improve the quality of the treated wastewater and render it suitable for disposal, an electrolytic flow process was associated with the wastewater treatment using a filter-press reactor with a boron doped diamond (BDD) electrode. The feasibility of the treatment was evidenced by the reuse of the treated wastewater in the production of a new paint (manufactured by the company supplying the raw wastewater), whose quality was compatible with the water used by the manufacturer. The best conditions for the coagulation flocculation process involved the use of 80 mL of MOAE (50 g/L of MO and 0.125 mol/L of Ca2+) for every 1.0 L of wastewater at pH 6.5. The limiting current density (35 mA/cm(2+)) and an electrolysis time of 90 min (charge passed of 3.68 A h/L) were used in the electrochemical treatment. Biotoxicity assays using the brine shrimp Artemia salina revealed that the mortality (in %) of microcrustaceans was reduced from 100% (raw wastewater) to only 11% at the end of the electrolysis process, in addition to eliminating the strong odor and 85% of the organic load. Moreover, microbiological tests showed that the number of mesophiles decreased by more than six orders of magnitude and there was no growth of thermotolerant coliforms (TC). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A hybrid electrochemical conditioning strategy for enhanced sewage sludge dewatering was proposed. A water content of 47.2 wt.% for the dewatered sludge cake was achieved at an applied voltage of 20 V for 30 min, which was significantly lower than previously reported results. The capillary suction time (CST) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) were decreased by 75.6% and 90.9%, respectively. Four simultaneous processes, including electrooxidation, the electro-Fenton process, molecular oxygen activation via zero valent iron (ZVI) and Fe(III) flocculation, had synergetic effects on the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to enhance sludge dewaterability. The in situ generation of ZVI on the cathode electrode facilitated the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) via activation of molecular oxygen. The sludge pH decreased spontaneously and remained acidic due to the competitive reaction of ZVI generation to hydrogen evolution as well as the Fe(III) flocculation process, which further guaranteed the high efficiency of hydroxyl radical generation. Changes in the physiochemical properties of the sludge (particle size distribution, zeta potential, viscosity and EPS characteristics) induced by the hybrid conditioning process were further explored. In addition, the economic potential of the hybrid system was preliminarily assessed (USD$ 127.6/ton dry sludge). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A reactive electrochemical membrane (REM) system was developed with titanium suboxide micro filtration membrane serving as the filter and the anode, and was examined to inactivate Escherichia coli (E. coli) in water at various current densities. After passing through the membrane filter, the concentration of E. coli decreased from 6.46 log CFU/mL to 0.18 log CFU/mL. The REM operation and effects, including membrane pressure, anode potential, protein leakage, and cell morphology, were characterized under different treatment conditions. It was found that several mechanisms, including membrane filtration, external electrical field influence, and direct oxidation, functioned in concert to lead to bacteria removal and inactivation, and direct oxidation likely played the major role. As revealed by scanning electron microscope and extracellular protein analysis, high current density and voltage caused severe cell damage that resulted in partial or complete cell disintegration. The removal of a model virus, bacteriophage MS2, was also investigated at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and achieved 6.74 log reduction compared to the original concentration (10(11) PFU/mL). In addition to illustration of mechanisms, this study may provide a potentially promising approach that is suitable for decentralized treatment to meet dispersed water disinfection needs.

AB Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works is one of the largest sewage treatment plants in the world and consists mainly of a chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) unit and a disinfection unit. It has long been realized that most of the dosed chlorine (15 mg/L) is lost at the beginning part of the disinfection unit during disinfection of the CEPT effluent. Lab-scale tests were therefore conducted in this study to determine the causes. Because ferric chloride is used in CEPT, ferrous iron in the CEPT effluent (from the reduction of ferric iron) was initially thought to be the main chlorine consumer. However, the chlorine consumption by ferrous iron was found to be 1.2 mg/L at most. Suspended solids and sulfide also did not contribute significantly to the chlorine consumption. Batch tests were therefore conducted to evaluate the effects of mixing condition and chlorine stock solution concentration on the chlorine consumption. Less chlorine was consumed upon increased mixing. Using a high-concentration chlorine stock solution (25000 mg/L) resulted in a 3-times-higher chlorine consumption in the absence of mixing than using a low-concentration chlorine stock solution (2500 mg/L). By correlating the losses of ammonia and total nitrogen with the chlorine consumption, we hypothesized that the use of a high concentration chlorine stock solution under poor mixing leads to a localized high ratio of chlorine to ammonia, resulting in breakpoint chlorination and an unusually excessive chlorine consumption. A novel apparatus was developed to quantify the nitrogen gas generated during chlorination of a simulated wastewater, and the mass balance of nitrogen-containing species (i.e., ammonia, nitrogen gas, nitrite and nitrate) during the chlorination was inspected. The good fit between the measured chlorine consumption and that back-calculated from nitrogen-containing species verified our hypothesis. Finally, it needs mentioning that the high chlorine consumption and the breakpoint chlorination may occur during chlorine disinfection of any sewage effluents with relatively high ammonia levels; thus it is suggested that either not-too-high concentrations of chlorine stock solutions or sufficient mixing should be applied during disinfection of the sewage effluents.

AB Cell-based metabolomics was used in a proof-of-concept fashion to investigate the biological effects of contaminants as they traveled from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge to a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) intake in a surface-water usage cycle. Zebrafish liver (ZFL) cells were exposed to water samples collected along a surface-water flowpath, where a WWTP was located similar to 14.5 km upstream of a DWTP. The sampling sites included: 1) upstream of the WWTP, 2) the WWTP effluent discharging point, 3) a proximal location downstream of the WWTP outfall, 4) a distal location downstream of the WWTP outfall, 5) the drinking water intake, and 6) the treated drinking water collected prior to discharge to the distribution system. After a 48-h laboratory exposure, the hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites in ZFL cell extracts were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed distinct changes in metabolite profiles in response to WWTP effluent exposure. These effects on the hydrophilic metabolome gradually diminished downstream of the WWTP, becoming nonsignificant at the drinking water intake (comparable to upstream of the WWTP, p = 0.98). However, effects on the lipophilic metabolome increased significantly as the river flowed from the distal location downstream of the WWTP to the drinking water intake (p < 0.001), suggesting a source of bioactive compounds in this watershed other than the WWTP. ZFL cells exposed to treated drinking water did not exhibit significant changes in either the hydrophilic (p = 0.15) or lipophilic metabolome (p = 0.83) compared to the upstream site, suggesting that constituents in the WWTP effluent were efficiently removed by the drinking water treatment process. Impacts on ZFL cells from the WWTP effluent included disrupted energy metabolism, a global decrease in amino acids, and altered lipid metabolism pathways. Overall, this study demonstrated the utility of cell-based metabolomics as an effective tool for assessing the biological effects of complex pollutant mixtures, particularly when used as a complement to conventional chemical monitoring.

AB While fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics are susceptible to degradation by sulfate and/or hydroxyl radicals formed in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) based advanced oxidation processes, here we report that unactivated PMS itself exhibits a specific high reactivity toward FQs for the first time. Reaction kinetics of PMS with two model FQs, ciprofloxacin (CF) and enrofloxacin (EF), showed a strong pH dependency with apparent second-order rate constants of 0.10-13.05 M(-1)s(-1) for CF and 0.51-33.17 M(-1)s(-1) for EF at pH 5-10. This pH dependency was well described by species-specific parallel reactions. On the basis of reaction kinetics and structure activity assessment, the tertiary and secondary aliphatic N4 amines on the FQs' piperazine ring were proposed to be the main reaction sites. High performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass analysis showed the formation of hydroxylated, N-oxide, and dealkylated products. Bacterial growth inhibition bioassays using Escherichia coli showed that oxidation products of FQs by PMS retained negligible antibacterial potency in comparison to parent FQs. Kinetic modeling using the rate constants estimated from pure water well predicted the oxidation kinetics of low levels of CF and EF by PMS in surface water. The degradation efficiency of FQs by PMS in surface water was slightly lower than that by ozone, comparable to that by ferrate, and much higher than that by permanganate. These results suggest that PMS is a promising oxidant for the treatment of FQs in water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ammonia nitrogen removal from wastewaters has gained much attention in recent decades as a result of the environmental problems associated with discharge of excessive amounts of this critical nutrient including eutrophication of receiving waters, generation of offensive odours as a result of organism decay and complications associated with the disinfection of water supplies. While removal via biological processes represents the principal means by which a reduction in dissolved nitrogen concentrations is achieved, an electrochemical advanced oxidation process has been proposed as a potentially effective alternate means of removing ammonia from wastewaters with the removal associated with the in situ generation of oxidants (particularly active chlorine) at the anode. Here we describe the influence of key factors on the rate and extent of ammonia nitrogen removal in an electrochemical cell with a Ti/IrO2-RuO2 anode and Ti cathode. The rate of ammonia removal was found to be dependent on both current density and initial chloride concentration with similar to 95% ammonia removed from a 20 mM Cl- solution within approximately 40 min at a current density of 3 mA cm(-2), resulting in an energy consumption of 126 kWh kg(-1) NHS4+-N. Additionally, we show that by-products formation is effectively suppressed during the electrolysis process. A mechanistically-based kinetic model incorporating the key processes operating in the ammonia electro-oxidation process was developed with particular attention given to (i) anodic generation of active chlorine and other chloride-related by-products, (ii) active chlorine mediated ammonia oxidation. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical advanced oxidation process is a promising technology for treatment of ammonia-containing wastewaters with advantages including simplicity, safety and effectiveness.

AB The therapeutic efficacy of antiretroviral drugs as well as challenges and side effects against the human immunodeficiency virus is well documented and reviewed. Evidence is available in literature indication that antiretrovirals are only partially transformed and become completely excreted from the human body in their original form and/or as metabolites in urine and feces. The possibility of massive release of antiretrovirals through human excreta that enters surface water through surface runoff and wastewater treatment plant effluents is now of environmental concern because the public might be experiencing chronic exposure to antiretrovirals. The primary concern of this review is limited data concerning environmental fate and ecotoxicity of antiretrovirals and their metabolites. The review aims to provide a comprehensive insight into the evaluation of antiretrovirals in environmental samples. The objective is therefore to assess the extent of analysis of antiretrovirals in environmental samples and also look at strategies including instrumentation and predictive models that have been reported in literature on the fate and ecotoxicological effects due to presence of antiretrovirals in different environmental compartments. The review also looks at current challenges and offers possible areas of exploration that could help minimize the presence of antiretrovirals in the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The performances of an equilibrium and a kinetic passive sampler for monitoring a range of organic contaminants (Log K-OW from -0.03 to 6.26) were evaluated in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant, the receiving river Saar as well as the river Mosel in Germany. The polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and a new mixed polymer sampler (MPS) were selected as kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers, respectively. Concentrations were described in terms of a time-weighted average concentration (C-TWA) from the POCIS measurements and as an equilibrium concentration from the MPS (CEquil-MPS) and POCIS membrane (CEquil-PES) analyses. Twenty-seven compounds could be detected, includig eight priority substances of the EU Water Framework Directive. Both sampler types detected a similar range of compounds in the low ng/L to mu g/L range, with a high proportion of pharmaceuticals being detected at all sampling sites. To account for uncertainty in the POCIS sampling rates, a range in C-TWA was estimated by applying low and high sampling rates. For the compounds that were detected in the POCIS this range was within a factor of 3.5. Interestingly, the MPS extracts showed lower ionisation artefacts than the POCIS extracts during the LC-MS/MS analysis. Finally, total water concentrations (G(Total)) were estimated from the dissolved concentrations, literature organic carbon partition coefficients (K-OC) and the total organic carbon levels measured in the rivers. For the compounds in this study, negligible differences between C-Total and the passive sampler-derived dissolved concentrations were found with a maximum difference of 15% for diclofenac. Overall, this study demonstrated that the parallel application of kinetic and equilibrium passive samplers can improve the description of water quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The identification of appropriate sanitation systems is particularly challenging in developing urban areas where local needs are not met by conventional solutions. While structured decision-making frameworks such as Community-Led Urban Environmental Sanitation (CLUES) can help facilitate this process, they require a set of sanitation system options as input. Given the large number of possible combinations of sanitation technologies, the generation of a good set of sanitation system options is far from trivial.
   This paper presents a procedure for generating a set of locally appropriate sanitation system options, which can then be used in a structured decision-making process. The systematic and partly automated procedure was designed (i) to enhance the reproducibility of option generation; (ii) to consider all types of conventional and novel technologies; (iii) to provide a set of sanitation systems that is technologically diverse; and (iv) to formally account for uncertainties linked to technology specifications and local conditions.
   We applied the procedure to an emerging small town in Nepal. We assessed the appropriateness of 40 technologies and generated 17,955 appropriate system options. These were classified into 16 system templates including on-site, urine-diverting, biogas, and blackwater templates. From these, a subset of 36 most appropriate sanitation system options were selected, which included both conventional and novel options.
   We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of different elements on the diversity and appropriateness of the set of selected sanitation system options. We found that the use of system templates is most important, followed by the use of a weighted multiplicative aggregation function to quantify local appropriateness. We also show that the optimal size of the set of selected sanitation system options is equal to or slightly greater than the number of system templates.
   As novel technologies are developed and added to the already large portfolio of technology options, the procedure presented in this work may become an essential tool for generating and exploring appropriate sanitation system options. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrasound is widely used in water and wastewater treatment. However, the influence of ultrasound on the composition and structure of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and consequently its behaviors is still unclear. In this study, the changes in proton and metal binding moieties in DOM caused by ultrasound at an environmentally relevant concentration (about 5 mg.L-1) were investigated using spectrophotometric titrations. The amounts of carboxylic and phenolic-like groups in DOM before and after ultrasound were quantified by the spectral parameter, Dslope(350-400) (the differential slope of the Log transformed DOM absorbance in the wavelength region of 350-400 nm) in combination with the non-ideal competitive adsorption (NICA) model. The results demonstrate that the concentration of carboxylic-like sites decreased with an increase in the ultrasound intensity at the same reaction time. However, the concentration of phenolic-like sites increased with an increase in the ultrasound intensity in most cases. The amounts of bound metal Ca(II) and Al(III) ions decreased with an increase of the ultrasound intensity due to the reduction of available total binding sites (carboxylic-like and phenolic like groups) in the DOM after ultrasound. This study provides detailed in-situ information concerning the changes in the properties and behaviors of DOM in ultrasound, which would be useful to understand in more detail and to optimize the utility of ultrasound in water and wastewater treatment.

AB Chromate is considered a toxic contaminant in various water sources because it poses a risk to animal and human health. To meet the stringent limits for chromium in water and wastewater, pyrrolic nitrogen structure was investigated as a chromate adsorbent for aqueous solutions, employing a polypyrrole coating on carbon black. The characteristics of the adsorbent were analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Chromate was adsorbed as both Cr(III) and Cr(VI). The chromate adsorption capacity increased (from 50.84 to 174.81 mg/g) with increasing amounts of pyrrole monomers (from 50 to 86%) in the adsorbent. The adsorption capacity was well-correlated with the pyrrolic nitrogen content (from 2.06 to 6.57 at%) in the adsorbent, rather than other types of nitrogen. The optimized adsorption capacity (174.81 mg/g in the equilibrium batch experiment and 211.10 mg/g at an initial pH of 3) was far superior to those of conventional adsorbents. We investigated the mechanism behind this powerful chromate adsorption on pyrrolic nitrogen via physical/chemical analyses of the pH-dependent adsorption behavior, supported by first-principles calculation based on density functional theory. We found that Cr(III) and Cr(VI) adsorption followed different reaction paths. Cr(III) adsorption occurred in two sequential steps: 1) A Jones oxidation reaction (JOR)-like reaction of Cr(VI) with pyrrolic N that generates Cr(III), and 2) Cr(III) adsorption on the deprotonated pyrrolic N through Cr(III) N covalent bonding. Cr(VI) adsorption followed an alternative path: hydrogen-bonding to the deprotonation-free pyrrolic N sites. The pH-dependent fractional deprotonation of the pyrrolic N sites by the JOR-like reaction in the presence of chromate played an important role in the adsorption. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Landfill leachate contains extremely diverse mixtures of pollutants and thus requires appropriate treatment before discharge. Co-treatment of landfill leachate with sewage in wastewater treatment plants is a common approach because of low cost and convenience. However, some recalcitrant organic compounds in leachate can escape biological treatment processes, lower the UV transmittance of waste streams due to their UV-quenching properties, and interfere with the associated disinfection efficacy. Thus, the leachate UV quenching substances (UVQS) must be removed or reduced to a level that UV disinfection is not strongly affected. UVQS consist of three major fractions, humic acids, fulvic acids and hydrophilics, each of which has distinct characteristics and behaviors during treatment. The purpose of this review is to provide a synthesis of the state of the science regarding UVQS and possible treatment approaches. In general, chemical, electrochemical, and physical treatments are more effective than biological treatments, but also costlier. Integration of multiple treatment methods to target the removal of different fractions of UVQS can aid in optimizing treatment. The importance of UVQS effects on wastewater treatment should be better recognized and understood with implemented regulations and improved research and treatment practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As a typical advanced oxidation technology, the Fenton reaction has been employed for the disinfection, owing to the strong oxidizability of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). However, the conventional Fenton system always exhibits a low H2O2 decomposition efficiency, leading to a low production yield of center dot OH, which makes the disinfection effect unsatisfactory. Herein, we develop a molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) co-catalytic Fenton reaction for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of Escherichia coli K-12 (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). As a co-catalyst in the Fe(II)/H2O2 Fenton system, MoS2 can greatly facilitate the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle reaction by the exposed Mo4+ active sites, which significantly improves the H2O2 decomposition efficiency for the center dot OH production. As a result, the MoS2 co-catalytic Fenton system can reach up to 83.37% of inactivation rate of E. coli just in 1 min and 100% of inactivation rate within 30 min, which increased by 2.5 times than that of the conventional Fenton reaction. Furthermore, the center dot OH as the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MoS2 co-catalytic Fenton reaction was measured and verified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and photoluminescence (PL). It is demonstrated an increased amount of center dot OH generated from the decomposition of H2O2 in the presence of MoS2, which is responsible for the rapid and efficient inactivation of E. coli and S. aureus. This study provides a new perspective for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of bacteria in environmental remediation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A staged impoundment scheme was adopted for the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) to increase its maximal water level from 135 to 175 m between 2003 and 2010; however, the variation in phosphorus distribution and its bioavailability in the water column and surface sediment, during this period is still uncertain. Field surveys and historical monitoring data related to water column, surface sediment, total phosphorus (TP) and fractional contents, and water bloom characteristics were used to identify the effects of staged impoundment on phosphorus distribution and water eutrophication in the TGR It is indicated that retention of particulate phosphorus (PP)-bounded suspended sediment (SS) caused an average of 4.69 %-12.28% decline in water column TP between 2004 and 2010 compared with that measured between 1998 and 2003. Phosphorus did not notably accumulate in the mainstream surface sediment when the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m. The mainstream surface sediment was relatively clean, and the release of sediment bioavailable P (Bio-P) contributed to 0.013% of dissolved phosphorus (DP) concentrations in the water column when impoundment of the TGR was 175 m. An increase in dissolved Bio-P in the water column and weak hydrodynamic conditions stimulated the outburst of water bloom in more tributaries when the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m, and the dominant algae gradually evolved from river-dominated species to lake dominated species. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the entry of DP from the upstream and tributaries into the TGR and manage TP loads in the TGR as a lake rather than as a river in the future.

AB Numerous contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) typically occur in urban rivers. Wastewater effluents are a major source of many CECs. Urban runoff (stormwater) is a major urban water budget component and may constitute another major CEC pathway. Yet, stormwater-based CEC field studies are rare. This research investigated 384 CECs in 36 stormwater samples in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. Nine sampling sites included three large stormwater conveyances (pipes) and three paired iron enhanced sand filters (IESFs; untreated inlets and treated outlets). The 123 detected compounds included commercial-consumer compounds, veterinary and human pharmaceuticals, lifestyle and personal care compounds, pesticides, and others. Thirty-one CECs were detected in >= 50% of samples. Individual samples contained a median of 35 targeted CECs (range: 18-54). Overall, median concentrations were >= 10 ng/L for 25 CECs and >= 100 ng/L for 9 CECs. Ranked, hierarchical linear modeling indicated significant seasonal- and site type-based concentration variability for 53 and 30 CECs, respectively, with observed patterns corresponding to CEC type, source, usage, and seasonal hydrology. A primarily warm weather, diffuse, runoff-based profile included many herbicides. A second profile encompassed winter and/or late summer samples enriched with some recalcitrant, hydrophobic compounds (e.g., PAHs), especially at pipes, suggesting conservative, less runoff-dependent sources (e.g., sediments). A third profile, indicative of mixed conservative/non-runoff, runoff, and/or atmospheric sources and transport that collectively affect a variety of conditions, included various fungicides, lifestyle, non-prescription, and commercial-consumer CECs. Generally, pipe sites had large, diverse land-use catchments, and showed more frequent detections of diverse CECs, but often at lower concentrations; while untreated sites (with smaller, more residential-catchments) demonstrated greater detections of "pseudo-persistent" and other ubiquitous or residentially-associated CECs. Although untreated stormwater transports an array of CECs to receiving waters, IESF treatment significantly removed concentrations of 14 (29%) of the 48 most detected CECs; for these, median removal efficiencies were 26%-100%. Efficient removal of some hydrophobic (e.g., PAHs, bisphenol A) and polar-hydrophilic (e.g., caffeine, nicotine) compounds indicated particulate-bound contaminant filtration and for certain dissolved contaminants, sorption.

AB Algae-derived dissolved organic matter (AOM) is an important nutrient source for heterotrophic bacteria, while AOM such as humic substances pose significant challenges during water treatment processing. We hypothesized that the parasitic infection of algae could change the composition and concentration of AOM. This study investigated the quality and quantity of DOM and bacterial abundance in diatom (Synedra) cultures, with and without parasitic fungi (chytrids). The quality of DOM was analyzed using three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) and was compared to changes in algal and bacterial cell numbers. Bacterial abundance was higher and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were lower in the diatom cultures infected with parasitic fungi. Among the DOM compounds, the concentrations of tryptophan-like material derived from algae were significantly lower and the concentrations of humic substance-like material were higher in the infected treatment. The parasitic fungi may have consumed tryptophan-like material and stimulated the release of humic substances. These results provide the first evidence that fungal infection may modulate algal-bacterial interactions, which are associated with changes in the nature of AOM. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ozone is an effective oxidant and disinfectant commonly used for elimination of micropollutants and inactivation of resistant microbes. However, undesirable oxidation/disinfection byproducts such as bromate might form during ozonation. In this study, the UV absorbance and fluorescence indices were applied as surrogate indicators for predicting the inactivation of bacteria and formation of bromate during ozonation of water and wastewater effluents. The inactivation efficiencies of lab-cultured Escherichia coli (E. coli) and autochthonous bacteria were measured by plating (for E. coli only) and flow cytometry with fluorescence staining. During ozonation of E. coli spiked into wastewater effluents (similar to 10(6) cell/mL), the priority of inactivation efficiency determined by different cell viability methods were in the order of CFU > membrane damage > DNA damage. Approximately, 99% membrane damage and/or 90% DNA damage are conservatively supposed as an indicator for sufficient bacterial inactivation as well as degradation of antibiotic resistance genes. The related required O-3 dosing thresholds for sufficient inactivation of E. coli and autochthonous bacteria refer to similar to 0.6 O-3/DOC (g/g), similar to 50% decrease of UVA254, similar to 60% decrease of UVA280, or similar to 80% decrease of humic-like fluorescence. Within the range of 10(6)-10(8) cell/mL the bacterial concentration did not have significant effects on the required thresholds of the specific O-3 doses or spectroscopic indicators required for bacterial inactivation. The addition of 50 mM tert-BuOH as center dot OH scavenger increased the required specific ozone doses but decreased the losses of spectroscopic indicators necessary for sufficient bacterial inactivation, and also suggested that the membrane/DNA damages for bacterial inactivation were mainly attributed to the direct O-3 attacks. The bromate concentration was determined using ion chromatography with MS/MS detection. The results showed that when O-3 was dosed at the required thresholds for sufficient bacterial inactivation, bromate formation could usually be suppressed below 10 mu g/L. The present work supports that it is possible to reach a balance between bacterial inactivation and bromate formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphate is a vital nutrient for life but its discharge from wastewater effluents can lead to eutrophication. Adsorption can be used as effluent polishing step to reduce phosphate to very low concentrations. Adsorbent reusability is an important parameter to make the adsorption process economically feasible. This implies that the adsorbent can be regenerated and used over several cycles without appreciable performance decline. In the current study, we have studied the phosphate adsorption and reusability of commercial iron oxide based adsorbents for wastewater effluent. Effects of adsorbent properties like particle size, surface area, type of iron oxide, and effects of some competing ions were determined. Moreover the effects of regeneration methods, which include an alkaline desorption step and an acid wash step, were studied. It was found that reducing the adsorbent particle size increased the phosphate adsorption of porous adsorbents significantly. Amongst all the other parameters, calcium had the greatest influence on phosphate adsorption and adsorbent reusability. Phosphate adsorption was enhanced by co-adsorption of calcium, but calcium formed surface precipitates such as calcium carbonate. These surface precipitates affected the adsorbent reusability and needed to be removed by implementing an acid wash step. The insights from this study are useful in designing optimal regeneration procedures and improving the lifetime of phosphate adsorbents used for wastewater effluent polishing.

AB Biofilm formation in membrane systems negatively impacts the filtration system performances. This study evaluated how biofilm compression driven by permeate flow increases the hydraulic resistance and leads to reduction in permeate flux. We analysed the effect of biofilm compression on hydraulic resistance and permeate flux through computational models supported by experimental data. Biofilms with homogeneous surface structure were subjected to step-wise changes in flux and transmembrane pressure during compression and relaxation tests. Biofilm thickness under applied forces was measured non-invasively in-situ using optical coherence tomography (OCT). A numerical model of poroelasticity, which couples water flow through the biofilm with biofilm mechanics, was developed to correlate the structural deformation with biofilm hydraulics (permeability and resistance). The computational model enabled extracting mechanical and hydrological parameters corresponding to the experimental data. Homogeneous biofilms under elevated compression forces experienced a significant reduction in thickness while only a slight increase in resistance was observed. This shows that hydraulic resistance of homogeneous biofilms was affected more by permeability decrease due to pore closure than by a decrease in thickness. Both viscoelastic and elastoplastic models could describe well the permanent biofilm deformation. However, for biofilms under study, a simpler elastic model could also be used due to the small irreversible deformations. The elastic moduli fitting the measured data were in agreement with other reported values for biofilm under compression. Biofilm stiffening under larger flow-driven compression forces was observed and described numerically by correlating inversely the elastic modulus with biofilm porosity. The importance of this newly developed method lies in estimation of accurate biofilm mechanical parameters to be used in numerical models for both membrane filtration system and biofouling cleaning strategies. Such model can ultimately be used to identify optimal operating conditions for membrane system subjected to biofouling. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI High ammonium loading can increase alkaline phosphatase activity and

AB In aquatic ecosystems, ammonium is one of the dominant substances in the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and its impact has been widely explored as it is thought, in its toxic form (NH3), to cause stress on organisms. Little is, however, known about its potential effect on the release of phosphorus (P) from the sediment. In a two-month mesocosm (150 L) experiment, we tested if high loading of ammonium promotes sediment P release and investigated the dominant underlying mechanisms. A gradient of five target ammonium loading levels was used by adding NH4CI fertilizer: no addition/control (N0), 3 (N1), 5 (N2), 10 (N3), and 21 (N4) mg NH4Cl L-1 (NH4CI expressed as nitrogen). We found that: 1) significant sediment P release for N3 and N4 but minor release or retention for NO, N1, and N2 were detected both by the total phosphorus concentration (TP) in the overlying water and in situ measurements of diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) at the sediment-water interface; 2) overall, TP correlated significantly and positively with total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in the water. Further correlation and path analyses suggested that stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) was likely the dominant mechanisms behind the ammonium-induced sediment P release and decreased dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (an approximate reduction from 9.2 to 6.6 mg O2 L-1) was likely a contributing factor, particularly in the beginning of the experiment.

AB The objectives of this study were to specifically detect viable Escherichia coli in environmental waters by targeting the ycjM gene in a propidium monoazide (PMA)-qPCR assay. PMA is a viability dye that can inhibit the amplification of DNA from dead cells, thus allowing for the detection and quantification of only viable cells. The ycjM primers were used to target E. coli that directly originated from the feces of warm blooded animals, and avoid false positive detection caused by "naturalized" E. coli that can exist in the environment. In this study, tap water and environmental waters were inoculated with E. coli isolated from animal feces. Following cell collection, samples were treated with PMA, followed by DNA isolation and qPCR detection. For pure cultures, 5 mu M PMA with a 10-min light exposure was efficient at inhibiting the amplification of DNA from 10(5) CFU/mL dead E. coli cells, with a detection limit of 10(2) CFU/100 mL viable cells. For tap and environmental waters collected in the winter, a 10 mu M PMA was required and as low as 10(3) CFU/100 mL viable cells could be detected in the presence of 10(5) CFU/100 mL dead cells. For water samples collected during the summer, 10(2) CFU/10 mL viable cells could be detected in the presence of 10(4) CFU/10 mL dead cells, after a 20 mu M PMA treatment. No significant differences were found among the PMA-qPCR assay and two other standard culture-based methods for detection of viable E. coli in environmental water. In conclusion, with proper pretreatment of environmental water samples, this PMA-qPCR assay that targets the ycjM gene could quantify viable E. coli cells that directly come from the feces of warm-blooded animals, and therefore effectively and accurately indicate the quality of environmental water.

AB Groundwater (GW) is one of the most abundant water resources and around 1.5 billion people rely on GW as their main water supply. Manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) are very common GW contaminants. Even though their presence is considered mainly as an organoleptic and operational nuisance, water with elevated Mn content may also lead to adverse health impacts. Amongst the most common treatment processes currently used to treat domestic GW supplies: catalytic filtration may lead to Mn leaching if improperly maintained; while ion exchange consumes a considerable amount of salt and produces a brine waste which pollutes the environment. Thus, it is proposed to design a simple, yet robust treatment system which can be implemented in small/remote communities or even domestic applications. To this end, the main objective of this investigation was to assess the potential application of novel outside-in sulfonated polyethersulfone thin-film composite hollow fiber nanofiltration (HFNF) membranes to remove dissolved Mn, Fe and natural organic matter (NOM) from domestic GW supplies. Of particular interest was the impact of GW matrix on performance of the HFNF membranes. Our experimental findings demonstrated that, in absence of hardness and the cumulative throughput of 1.9 L/m(2), above 90 % of Mn, Fe and NOM were retained by the examined HFNF membranes (MWCO similar to 200 Da) regardless of their initial concentrations in the feed solution (250-1000 mu g/L). In contrast, increasing the hardness level reduced the removal of Mn and Fe ions. XPS analysis revealed that the surface properties of the HFNF membranes were altered when the membranes were exposed to calcium and magnesium salts. These observations were attributed to the propensity for Ca and Mg ions to bind to the sulfonic groups present on the surface of the HFNF membranes which, subsequently, weakens rejection by charge exclusion. On the other hand, in the absence of GW hardness, charge exclusion was mainly responsible for rejection of dissolved Mn and Fe. It was also found that GW hardness had no marked impact on the NOM rejection as the later was mostly removed by size exclusion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A fairly clean ice cover can form over a contaminated water pond when the air-cooled surface of water freezes and impurities are efficiently expelled to the remaining water underneath. Natural freeze crystallization has recently been studied as a potential wastewater purification method with aqueous solutions on a laboratory scale. The effect of impurity inclusions on ice strength has been researched in model ice basins over the past few decades. It is of interest to discover how efficiently natural freeze separation works under real weather conditions before freezing can be utilized for wastewater treatment application. Herein, understanding the mechanical strength properties of naturally frozen wastewater (ice) is important when planning ice breaking and harvesting devices.
   This research implemented in-situ measurements of the flexural and compressive strength of ice in natural ice-covered environments of a freshwater lake, two peatlands and three mining site basins, and compares the determined strength with analyzed impurities of the ice. The results showed that despite varying ice growth conditions and initial water constituents, it was possible to deduce an evident yet simple relationship between mean ice strength and ice impurities: the more impure the ice is, the lower the value of strength is Based on this exploration, it was concluded that separation efficiencies, i.e. the impurity removal ratio between basin water and ice, from 65% up to 90% can be achieved by natural freezing.

AB Low energy consumption and less fouling propensity of forward osmosis (FO) processes have been attractive as a promising water filtration technology. The performance of this process is however significantly influenced by its operating conditions. Moreover, these operating parameters have both favourable and adverse effects on its performance. Therefore, it is very important to optimize its performance for efficient and economic operation. This study aims to develop a software to analyze a full-scale FO system for optimum performance. A comprehensive theoretical framework was developed to estimate the performance of FO system. Analysis results were compared with the experimental results to validate the models. About 5% deviation of simulation results and the experimental findings shows a very good agreement between them. A novel optimization algorithm was then developed to estimate the minimum required draw solution (DS) inlet flowrate and the number of elements in a pressure vessel to attain the design objectives (i.e. desired final DS concentration and recovery rate at a specific feed solution (FS) flowrate). A detailed parametric study was also conducted to determine the optimum operating conditions for different objectives. It showed that for a specific design objective, higher recovery rate can be achieved by increasing the DS flowrate and number of elements in a pressure vessel. In contrast, lower final concentration can be obtained by lowering the DS flowrate and increasing the number of elements. Finally, a MATLAB based software with graphical user interface was developed to make the analysis process easier and efficient. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The application of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) technology has increased in popularity, largely due to the smaller physical footprint, enhanced biological nutrient removal performance and ability to perform with a more stable operation when compared to conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems. To date, the ability of AGS to remove microbial pathogens such as; Escherichia coli, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium has not been reported. This study compared the log(10) removal performance of commonly used pathogen surrogates (sulfite-reducing clostridia spores, f-RNA bacteriophage, E. coli and total coliforms) by AGS and CAS during the start-up phase, through to maturation. Results showed that AGS performed as well as CAS for the logio removal performance of all microbial surrogates, except for spores which were removed more effectively by AGS most likely due to greater adherence of spores to the AGS biomass compared to CAS mixed liquor. Results suggest that AGS is capable of meeting or exceeding CAS-equivalent health based targets for pathogen removal in the context of water recycling as well as not adversely affecting the secondary effluent water quality (suspended solids, turbidity and particle size) in terms of ultraviolet light transmissivity (254 nm). These findings confirmed for the first time that the adoption of AGS operation would not adversely impact downstream tertiary disinfection processes from altered water quality, nor would it require further pathogen treatment interventions in addition to what is already required for CAS systems.

AB In recent years, a significant effort has been devoted into investigating the effects of chloride on the degradation kinetics of aromatic pollutants. The impact of chloride on the decomposition of short-chain carboxylic acid intermediates from aromatics degradation has often been overlooked. In this study the roles of chloride in the oxidation of maleic acid (MA) in the Fe(II)/peroxymonosulfate (PMS) process was investigated. Degradation efficiency, reaction intermediates, adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) accumulation and mineralization were examined. The chloride ion (Cl-) was found to have an overall negative impact on MA degradation and mineralization in the Fe(II)/PMS system. The presence of Cl- led to the formation of chlorinated by-products and a high production of AOX. The mineralization of MA was decreased with increasing Cl- concentrations. Kinetic modeling demonstrated the impact of various radicals largely depended on the concentration of Cl-. The significance of Cl-2(center dot-) or Cl-2 for MA destruction was enhanced with increasing Cl- content, and overwhelmed that of SO4 center dot- when the Cl- concentration was over 5 mM. In the absence of Cl-, SO4 center dot- was the primary radical responsible for MA oxidation. A possible degradation pathway is proposed (cis-trans isomerization, decarboxylation and halogenations processes). These results may help to understand the full oxidation pathways of refractory aromatic compounds and the mechanism of chlorinated by-products formation in industrial saline wastewater treatment.

AB The propane hydrate formation was proposed to have potentials in realizing free-conditioning dewatering of sewage sludge with implications to simultaneous clean water extraction and highly efficient volume reduction. Primarily, the investigation on phase equilibrium of propane hydrates found that the organic components of sewage sludge promoted the propane hydrate formation in terms of decreasing equilibrium pressure by up to 19.2%, compared with that in pure water. Further, the feasibility of hydrate based dewatering was verified through the observation of propane hydrate formation in sewage sludge and also the quality analysis of water generated from decomposition of up-floated formed hydrates. The formation of up-floated propane hydrates extracted water molecules from sewage sludge into homogeneous crystal phase, which actually excluded sludge particles from hydrate phase and realized the reduction of water in sludge phase. The efficiency of water conversion into hydrates was determined by monitoring propane pressure, which indicated that 14 batch runs decreased the water content of sludge from 98.81wt.% to 44.3wt.% under free-conditioning conditions. The chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and total phosphorus of hydrate-extracted water were measured to be 21 +/- 1 mg/L, 10.5 +/- 0.2 mg/L and 0.4 +/- 0 mg/L, respectively, which reflected the excellent separation performance and also indicated that the hydrate-extracted water can be directly discharged without further treatments. Finally, the unit energy consumption of hydrate-based dewatering process based on a continuous operation mode was calculated to be 2673.96 kW h/t dry solid of sewage sludge, which was nearly half of that in thermal drying process. Therefore, the propane hydrate-based process is believed to maximize the green operation of enhanced sludge dewatering while minimizing the energy and additional material consumption.

AB In this study, we comparatively investigated the degradation of 12 trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) during UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS) processes. Second-order rate constants for the reactions of iopromide, phenytoin, caffeine, benzotriazole, and primidone with sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) were determined for the first time. Experiments were conducted in buffered pure water and wastewater effluent with spiked TOrCs. UV/PDS degraded all TOrCs more efficiently than UV/H2O2 in buffered pure water due to the higher yield of SO4 center dot- than that of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) at the same initial molar dose of PDS and H2O2, respectively. UV/PDS showed higher selectivity toward TOrCs removal than UV/H2O2 in wastewater effluent. Compounds with electron-rich moieties, such as diclofenac, venlafaxine, and metoprolol, were eliminated faster in UV/PDS whereas UV/H2O2 was more efficient in degrading compounds with lower reactivity to SO4 center dot-. The fluence-based rate constants (k(obs-UV/H2O2)) of TOrCs in wastewater effluent linearly increased as a function of initial H2O2 dose during UV/H2O2, possibly due to the constant scavenging impact of the wastewater matrix on (OH)-O-center dot. However, exponential increase of k(obs-UV/PDS) with increasing PDS dose was observed for most compounds during UV/PDS, suggesting the decreasing scavenging effect of the water matrix (electron-rich site of effluent organic matter (EfOM)) after initial depletion of SO4 center dot- at low PDS dose. Fulvic and humic-like fluorophores appeared to be more persistent during UV/H2O2 compared to aromatic protein and soluble microbial product-like fluorophores. In contrast, UV/PDS efficiently degraded all identified fluorophores and showed less selectivity toward the fluorescent EfOM components. Removal pattern of TOrCs during pilot-scale UV/PDS was consistent with lab-scale experiments, however, overall removal rates were lower due to the presence of higher concentration of EfOM and nitrite.

AB Antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are considered new classes of water contaminants due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. This paper provides comprehensive data on the occurrences of 19 antibiotics, bacteria resistant to 10 antibiotics, and 15 ARGs in raw influent and different treatment stages of conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems. Seventeen out of the 19 target antibiotics were detected in raw influent with concentrations of up to ten micrograms per liter. Concentrations of antibiotics measured in the secondary effluent were much lower compared to those in the raw influent. Among the antibiotics, amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, meropenem, minocycline, oxytetracycline, sulfamethazine and vancomycin had highest removal by CAS or MBR systems with median removal efficiency (RE) > 70%, while trimethoprim and lincomycin were recalcitrant in the CAS system with median RE <50%. Similarly, the target ARB and ARGs were omnipresent in the raw influent samples with average concentrations as high as 2.6 x 10(6) CFU/mL and 2.0 x 10(7) gene copies/mL, respectively. The concentrations of ARB in secondary effluent of the CAS system declined relative to the raw influent (i.e. lower than raw influent by 2-3 orders of magnitude) and no ARB were detected in the MF permeate of the MBR system. For ARGs, their concentrations in secondary effluent/MF permeate ranged from below method quantification limit (<MQL) to 10(4) gene copies/mL. It is noteworthy that several ARGs, i.e. bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(SHV), ermB, intl1, sul1 and tetO, were still found in the MF permeate of the MBR system at average concentrations up to 10(3) copies/mL. In conclusion, MBR outperformed CAS in the elimination of ARB, ARGs and most target antibiotics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the hydraulic performance of two swales composed of filters for stormwater management (filtering swales) in a large-scale experimental study and compares them to the performance of a swale composed of traditional bioretention soil (bioswale). Using experimental data, dimensionless formulations are derived to reflect the influence of swale design parameters on hydraulic performance. The developed formulas can be used to design swales accounting for practical factors for decision makers such as local rainfall patterns, volume capture requirements, and drainage area. The experimental data show that while the bioswale is characterized by large overland flows, the tested filtering swales manage, in the majority of cases, the complete inflow volume without overland flow. The longitudinal slope of the swales does not affect the infiltration capacity of the filtering swales for the tested experimental boundary conditions, only the inflow rate and media water content are found to be statistically significant. As an example, filtering swales tested in this study captured 90% of the runoff generated by a 12.2 mm/h storm (approximately a 5-year return period 1-h duration storm event in the city of Trondheim) on a road 40 times larger than the swale. This highlights the capacity of such swales for handling infrequent events. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) can be scavenged by rainfall and contribute dissolved organic matter (DOM) to rainwater. Rainwater may serve as a part or the whole of drinking water sources, leading to the introduction of PM-derived DOM into drinking water. However, little information is available on the role of PM-derived DOM as a remarkable precursor of CX3R-type disinfection by-products (DBPs) in rainwater. In this study, samples were collected from ten occurrences of rainfall in Shanghai and batch experiments were executed to explore the contribution of PM-derived DOM to CX3R-type DBP formation in rainwater and to further understand some of unknowns regarding its characteristics. Results revealed that a part of PM was scavenged by rainfall and the scavenge performance was better for smaller PM. The formation potentials (FPs) of individual CX3R-type DBP were similar among size-isolated PM. TCM was predominant (around 0.5-4.5 mu g-C/mg-C) and TCAA was the secondary (around 0.6-3.2 mu g-C/mg-C) among all detectable CX3R-type DBPs. Based on the PM removal data and DBP FP results, the contribution of PM-derived DOM to CX3R-type DBP formation in rainwater was modeled. Furthermore, aromatic proteins and soluble microbial product-like compounds were found to be significant compositions, which were reported to be DBP precursors. And low molecular weight (< 10 kDa) DOM derived from total PM and rainwater exhibited higher CX3R-type DBP FPs. DOM fractions with higher SUVA(254) and SUVA(285) values gave relatively higher yields of CX3R-type DBPs, indicating that aromatic compounds played an important role in DBP formation.

AB Evidence of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in watersheds has attracted worldwide attention. Limited in formation is available on the occurrences of health-related antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens (ARBPs) in recreational waters. The effects of certain environmental factors (e.g., suspended particles) on the spread of resistance also has not been characterized to date. In this study, a combination of culture and molecular methods was employed to comprehensively investigate the patterns of microbial resistance to representative antibiotics in samples from three recreational lakes in Beijing. The antibiotic resistance index (ARI) based on the gradient concentration assay revealed that samples showed high resistance to penicillin-G, moderate resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin and erythromycin and low resistance to ceftriaxone, gentamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) were cultured and collected, and the diversity of potential ARBP species was further explored using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The results showed that most of the identified ARBPs were environmental opportunistic pathogens with emerging clinical concerns, e.g., the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter junii. Furthermore, particle-attached (PA) fractions presented higher ARI values than free-floating (FL) fractions did, indicating that the PA fractions were more resistant to selected antibiotics. And the NGS results revealed that the PA fractions showed higher similarity in the screened ARB community compositions in comparison with the FL fractions, primarily due to a protective effect provided by the particles. Accordingly, ARBPs could persist for a longer time in protective particle matrices. However, quantification of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) by qPCR showed no significant abundance differences between the two fractions. Overall, these findings suggest a potential health risk from the prevalence of ARBPs in recreational waters and provides a better understanding of the contribution of particles in the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems, with implications for the control of excessive suspended particles by water management.

AB Nitrification failure of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in cold season calls into investigations of the functional ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs). In this study, we report the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacteria (AOB) and complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox) Nitrospira in 23 municipal WWTPs in cold season, and explore the correlations between AOMs abundance and their relative contribution to nitrification. The copy numbers of AOA and AOB amoA gene ranged from 2.42 x 10(7) to 2.47 x 10(9) and 5.54 x 10(6) to 3.31 x 10(9) copies/g sludge, respectively. The abundance of amoA gene of Candidatus Nitrospira inopinata, an important strain of comammox Nitrospira, was stable with averaged abundance of 8.47 x 10(6) copies/g sludge. DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) assays were conducted with three typical WWTPs in which the abundance of AOA was lower than, similar to and higher than that of AOB, respectively. The results showed that considerable C-13-assimilation by AOA was detected during active nitrification in all WWTPs, whereas just a much lesser extent of C-13-incorporation by AOB and comammox Nitrospira was found in one WWTP. High throughput sequencing with C-13-labeled DNA also showed the higher reads abundance of AOA than AOB and comammox Nitrospira. Nitrososphaera viennensis was the dominant active AOA, while Nitrosomonas oligotropha and Nitrosomonas europaea were identified as active AOB. The results obtained suggest that AOA, rather than AOB and comammox Nitrospira, dominate ammonia oxidation in WWTPs in cold season despite the numerical relationships of AOMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The treatment efficiency of a vegetative filter strip and a biofiltration swale treating heavily loaded road runoff are evaluated. Concentrations measured in water drained from the two systems are compared to those in untreated road runoff collected from a reference catchment for a wide range of contaminants including organic carbon, nutrients (N and P), trace metals, and organic micropollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), alkylphenols, bisphenol-A, phthalates), in both total and dissolved phases. Predominantly particulate pollutants, including Pb, Zn and PAH, were very efficiently removed (around 90%) for most events. However, poor particulate removal was observed during a winter period. Relatively few pollutants were significantly removed in the dissolved phase and observed concentration reductions tended to be lower than those of suspended solids and associated pollutants; as such, lower removals were observed for total concentrations of moderately particulate micropollutants, including bisphenol-A, alkylphenols and phthalates. In addition, some pollutants appear to be emitted from various biofilter components (filter media, drainage and lining materials), as low or negative concentration removals were observed during the first months of operation of the biofiltration swale.

AB Adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) is a parameter conventionally used to indicate the sum of organic halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBP5), which are formed from the reactions of disinfectants with dissolved organic matter, bromide and iodide in water. To overcome the issues of the AOX analytical method, we proposed a new facile and green pretreatment method to enable the analysis of nonionic total organic halogen (NTOX) via the following three steps: 1) separation of NTOX and halides with electrodialysis, 2) conversion of NTOX with ultraviolet (UV) photolysis, and 3) analysis of halides with ion chromatography. To verify this proposal, we mainly evaluated the efficiency of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) coupled with UV photolysis (VUV-UV) in converting NTOX into halides. Results showed that by applying VUV irradiation for 60 min and UV irradiation at pH 10-11 for another 30 min, over 85.5% of each halide from 20 representative small molecular weight DBP5 (each at 100 mu g-X/L level) was recovered. The purpose of UV photolysis under alkaline conditions was to reduce oxyhalides (such as bromate and iodate) formed in the VUV process back to halides. With the aid of electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, we captured the whole pictures of high molecular weight polar DBPs in a chlorinated drinking water before and after VUV-UV, through which averagely 96.4% of dehalogenation with the VUV-UV treatment was observed. An illustrative comparison of the conventional AOX method and the proposed NTOX method indicates that although the detected NTOX was lower (by 2.3-30.6%) than AOX, the results of the two methods were highly correlated (R-2 > 0.97). All these hence verified the photolysis as a mature yet novel tool for sample pretreatment in environmental analytical chemistry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The advantage of using non-invasive imaging such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) to asses material properties from deformed biofilm geometries can be compromised by the assumptions made on fluid forces acting on the biofilm. This study developed a method for the determination of elastic properties of biofilms by modelling the biofilm deformation recorded by OCT imaging with poroelastic fluid-structure interaction computations. Two-dimensional biofilm geometries were extracted from OCT scans of non-deformed and deformed structures as a result of hydrodynamic loading. The biofilm geometries were implemented in a model coupling fluid dynamics with elastic solid mechanics and Darcy flow in the biofilm. The simulation results were compared with real deformed geometries and a fitting procedure allowed estimation of the Young's modulus in given flow conditions. The present method considerably improves the estimation of elastic moduli of biofilms grown in mini-fluidic rectangular channels. This superior prediction is based on the relaxation of several simplifying assumptions made in past studies: shear stress is not anymore taken constant over the biofilm surface, total stress including also pressure is accounted for, any biofllm shape can be used in the determinations, and non-linear behavior of mechanical properties can be estimated. Biofilm elastic moduli between 70 and 700 Pa were obtained and biofllm hardening at large applied stress due to increasing flow velocity was quantified. The work performed here opens the way for in-situ determination of other mechanical properties (e.g., viscoelastic properties, relaxation times, plastic yields) and provides data for modelling biofilm deformation and detachment with eventual applications in biofilm control and removal strategies.

AB This study investigates the biofouling resistance of modified reverse osmosis (RO) feed spacers. Control spacers (made of polypropylene) were functionalized with a biocidal coating (silver), hydrophilic (SiO2 nanoparticles) or superhydrophobic (TMPSi-TiO2 nanoparticles) anti-adhesive coatings, or a hybrid hydrophilic-biocidal coating (graphene oxide). Performance was measured by adhesion assays, viability tests, and permeate flow decline in a bench scale RO system. The control spacers proved to be one of the better performing materials based on bacterial deposition and dynamic RO fouling experiments. The good anti-adhesive properties of the control can be explained by its near ideal surface free energy (SFE). The only surface modification that significantly reduced biofouling compared to the control was the biocidal silver coating, which outperformed the other spacers by all measured indicators. Therefore, future efforts to improve spacer materials for biofouling control should focus on engineering biocidal coatings, rather than anti-adhesive ones. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work proposes a technology for phosphonate removal from wastewater using magnetically separable microparticles modified with a tailored ZnFeZr-oxyhydroxide adsorbent material which proved to be highly efficient, reaching a maximum loading of similar to 20 mg nitrilotrimethylphosphonic acid-P/g (215 mu mol NTMP/g) at room temperature, pH 6 and 30 min contact time. The adsorption process at pH < 7 was fast, following the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. Furthermore, NTMP adsorption onto ZnFeZr-oxyhydroxide proved to be endothermic. At pH > pH(pzc) approximate to 7 (point of zero charge of the material) a drop in adsorption efficiency was observed for phosphate and for five different investigated phosphonates. Adsorption of NTMP could not be detected at pH > 8, however, the presence of more than 0.5 mM Ca-II improved significantly the adsorption efficiency. Successful reusability of the engineered particles was demonstrated throughout 30 loading cycles by changing the operational conditions (dose, pH) to optimize the performance. At optimal conditions, complete phosphonate removal was observed even after 30 cycles of particles' reuse in a synthetic NTMP-solution and DTPMP-rich membrane concentrate. In each cycle, phosphorus was desorbed and concentrated in a 2 M NaOH. Industrial phosphonate-containing wastewaters rich in calcium, e.g. membrane concentrates, proved to be especially suitable for treatment with the particles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A computational network heat transfer model was utilised to model the potential of heat energy recovery at multiple locations from a city scale combined sewer network. The uniqueness of this network model lies in its whole system validation and implementation for seasonal scenarios in a large sewer network. The network model was developed, on the basis of a previous single pipe heat transfer model, to make it suitable for application in large sewer networks and its performance was validated in this study by predicting the wastewater temperature variation across the network. Since heat energy recovery in sewers may impact negatively on wastewater treatment processes, the viability of large scale heat recovery was assessed by examining the distribution of the wastewater temperatures throughout a 3000 pipe network, serving a population equivalent of 79500, and at the wastewater treatment plant inlet. Three scenarios; winter, spring and summer were modelled to reflect seasonal variations. The model was run on an hourly basis during dry weather. The modelling results indicated that potential heat energy recovery of around 116, 160 & 207 MWh/day may be obtained in January, March and May respectively, without causing wastewater temperature either in the network or at the inlet of the wastewater treatment plant to reach a level that was unacceptable to the water utility.

AB Adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) is a bulk organic parameter conventionally used to indicate all adsorbable halogenated organic disinfection byproducts formed in disinfected water. Analytically, AOX is determined by three sequential steps: 1) concentration and separation of AOX from halides with activated carbon, 2) conversion of AOX into halides with pyrolysis, and 3) quantification of halides via microcoulometry or ion chromatography (IC). Because the approach is relatively costly and cannot effectively recover non-adsorbable compounds, we herein proposed a facile and green pretreatment tool to measure the nonionic portion of total organic halogen (NTOX) with a new three-step approach: 1) separation of NTOX and halides with electrodialysis (ED), 2) conversion of NTOX into halides with ultraviolet, and 3) analysis of halides with IC. To verify this proposal, this study presented the efficiency of ED in separating halides and NTOX under a variety of operational and environmental conditions. The results showed that ED removed >= 98.5% of fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide from all tested waters (up to 1000 mg-X/L) within 1.5 h. Meanwhile, ED recovered an average of 87.9% of fourteen small molecular weight model compounds with each at 100 AWL. By using electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, the whole pictures of high molecular weight compounds in a chlorinated drinking water before and after ED pretreatment were compared, which revealed 79.7% and 83.6% recoveries of overall polar chlorinated and brominated compounds, respectively. In addition, the quantity and property of the dissolved organic matter were largely maintained by ED, and the retained organics may be used for later characterization. The study hence presents a novel use of ED as a pretreatment tool to enable subsequent NTOX measurement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate a hydrogel bowl capable of selectively and rapidly collecting spilled oil while floating on water. The bowl has macroscopic openings in its sidewall, and its surface is first coated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and then with diffusion pump oil, which imparts exceptional hydrophobic, oleophilic, and high oil wettability properties. The use of a hydrogel makes it possible to obtain surface hydrophobicity and oleophilicity, while also being inexpensive, eco-friendly, and easy to fabricate. Using a prototype of the bowl and a small pump system, we demonstrate that oils with a broad range of viscosities (2.7-2000.0 cSt at 20-40 degrees C) are more rapidly and efficiently collected from the surface of both pure water and seawater than with any other reported technique. The hydrogel bowl can collect oil for more than one month without losing its efficiency and can be stored in oil for reuse. Therefore, such hydrogel bowls represent a new alternative to conventional oil spill remediation techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ethanol and lactate are considered suitable electron donors (EDs) for chain elongation (CE); however, their respective shortcomings still limit the substrate conversion ratio and medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) production. To address this limitation, different EDs and electron acceptors (EAs) were combined to compare their CE performances, and to investigate whether the combination of ethanol and lactate could further enhance the MCFA production based on the complementary characteristics of ethanol and lactate. The results verified, for the first time, ethanol and lactate as the co-EDs formed a cooperative relationship to largely promote the conversion of substrates into MCFA. The co-EDs of ethanol and lactate stimulated the transformation of dispersive lactate-carbon flux from the competing acrylate pathway into n-heptylate. Additionally, the coexisting by-products (H-2 and CO2) from ethanol and lactate also contributed to the supererogatory MCFA generation. The key microbial taxa that distinguished the co-EDs from their single action were the preponderant species from class Negativicutes and family Ruminococcaceae. In addition, the co-EAs of acetate, n-butyrate, and n-caproate also promoted MCFA generation. Low concentration of n-caproate could be directly elongated into n-caprylate, while n-caproate concentration exceeding the toxic limit was unsuitable as an EA. This research provided a guide for substrate selection and collocation for CE technology. Chinese liquor-making wastewater (CLMW) was subsequently used as a substrate for MCFA production since it contains abundant lactate, ethanol, and short-chain fatty acids. In this study, a MCFA selectivity of 80.34 +/- 5.26%, a slightly higher selectivity which is in the range of previously reported ones, was obtained. This study paves a way for the sustainable development of Chinese liquor industry by recycling the high-output CLMW into MCFA. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID LOW-PH; WASTE-WATER; GAS
AB Recovery of phosphate from wastewater is challenging, with one of the best opportunities being recovery from sludge anaerobic digestion liquor, as struvite. However, this is limited by the proportion of total phosphorous which is soluble, due to in-digester metal ion precipitation. High-pressure anaerobic digestion may enable enhanced phosphate solubility (and hence recovery potential), without the use of added acid, due to an increased liquid phase CO2 concentration. This was tested at 2, 4, and 6 bar absolute (bara) vs a 1 bara control reactor, fed with activated sludge. Increased pressure significantly (p = 0.0008), increased the fraction of phosphate that was soluble, ranging from 52% at 1 bara, to 75% at 6 bara. Model based analysis indicated that the main reason for increased solubility was pH depression (down to 6.4 at 6 bara), rather than changes in ion pairing (with carbonates) or increases in ionic activity. However, biological performance was adversely impacted, with a substantial loss in VS and COD destruction (on the order of 5%-10% absolute). No organic acid accumulation was observed. Bacterial and archaeal communities were significantly impacted (p similar to 0.0003-0.0005), with a shift to specific organisms, including Bacteroidales Rikenellaceae within the bacteria, and a Deep Sea Euryarchaeotal Group at 2 bara, and Methanocellaceae within the archaea at 4 and 6 bara. The work indicates that high-pressure operation is a technically viable option to improve phosphate recovery, and produce a high-methane biogas product, but that the loss of overall conversion needs to be further addressed, possibly through two-stage digestion.

Furthermore, highest adsorption of DOM (in terms of DOC, UV254 and fluorescence) was observed during wastewater filtration. UV absorbing DOM had fast and similar breakthrough in surface water and synthetic water, whereas fluorescence breakthrough was very rapid only in synthetic water. PARAFAC modeling showed that different fluorescing components were differently adsorbed during GAC process. Particularly, fluorescing components with maxima intensity at higher excitation wavelengths, which are corresponding to humic-like fluorescence substances, were better removed than other components in all waters. As opposed to DOM, EOCs were better adsorbed during synthetic water filtration, whereas the fastest EOCs breakthrough was observed during filtration of wastewater, which was the water that determined the highest carbon fouling. Exception was represented by long-chained perfluoroalkylated substances (i.e., PFOA, PFDA and PFOS). Indeed, adsorption of these compounds resulted independent of water quality. In this study was also investigated the applicability of UV254 and fluorescing PARAFAC components to act as surrogates in predicting EOCs removal by GAC in different water matrices. Empirical linear correlation for the investigated EOCs were determined with UV254 and fluorescing components in all water qualities. However, fluorescence measurements resulted more sensitive than UV254 to predict EOC breakthrough during GAC adsorption. When the data from all water qualities was combined, good correlations between the microbial humic-like PARAFAC component and EOC removals were still observed and they resulted independent of water quality if considering only real water matrices (wastewater and surface water). On the contrary, correlations between EOC removals and UV254 removals were independent of water quality when combining data of surface waters and synthetic water, but a different correlation model was needed to predict EOCs breakthrough in wastewater.

AB Found in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs), swimming pools, and recreational waters, N. fowleri, is the causative agent of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Although cases of N. fowleri infections are rare, the fatality is comparatively high (>95%) and surveillance is essential to minimize N. fowleri infections. However, conventional N. fowleri detection methods are less satisfying owing to their time-consuming and lab intensive characteristics as well as the lack of the ability to determine viability. As a result, an alternative detection approach capable of determining viability as well as species identification is required to better ensure public health. Based on our previous research focusing on distinguishing laboratory cultured N. fowleri from N. lovaniensis and N. italica, this study applies untargeted metabolomics methods to field samples from operational DWDSs. A list of diagnostic features was found to preliminarily discriminate the N. fowleri positive from N. fowleri negative and N. lovaniensis positive field samples with satisfying predictive accuracy. The results outlined in this manuscript further validate and improve the metabolite-based N. fowleri detection approach, potentially aiding water utilities in the detection and management of N. fowleri in drinking water.

AB As more sensor data become available across urban water systems, it is often unclear which of these new measurements are actually useful and how they can be efficiently ingested to improve predictions. We present a data-driven approach for modeling and predicting flows across combined sewer and drainage systems, which fuses sensor measurements with output of a large numerical simulation model. Rather than adjusting the structure and parameters of the numerical model, as is commonly done when new data become available, our approach instead learns causal relationships between the numerically modeled outputs, distributed rainfall measurements, and measured flows. By treating an existing numerical model - even one that may be outdated - as just another data stream, we illustrate how to automatically select and combine features that best explain flows for any given location. This allows for new sensor measurements to be rapidly fused with existing knowledge of the system without requiring recalibration of the underlying physics. Our approach, based on Directed Information (DI) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), is evaluated by fusing measurements across nearly 30 rain gages, 15 flow locations, and the outputs of a numerical sewer model in the city of Detroit, Michigan: one of the largest combined sewer systems in the world. The results illustrate that the Boosted Regression Trees provide skillful predictions of flow, especially when compared to an existing numerical model. The innovation of this paper is the use of the Directed Information step, which selects only those inputs that are causal with measurements at locations of interest. Better predictions are achieved when the Directed Information step is used because it reduces overfitting during the training phase of the predictive algorithm. In the age of "big water data", this finding highlights the importance of screening all available data sources before using them as inputs to data-driven models, since more may not always be better. We discuss the generalizability of the case study and the requirements of transferring the approach to other systems. 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorus (P) recovery from waste streams is attracting more attention due to the twin problems of aquatic eutrophication and global phosphorus scarcity. Layered double hydroxide mineral materials are promising phosphate adsorbents due to their excellent anion-exchange abilities and large surface area. In this study, the adsorption isotherms estimated the saturation capacity of calcined layered double hydroxide (LDH) nano-composites for phosphate as 100.7 mg-Pig-adsorbent. Ion exchange is proposed as the major mechanism in the sorption process. The commonly utilized desorption method via sodium hydroxide was found to cause recrystallization of LDH particles in increased crystal size based on the dissolution-reprecipitation (D-R) mechanism. Ammonia solution was used to desorb P from LDH adsorbent. However, struvite crystallization occurred during the desorption process because struvite has a higher precipitation tendency than LDH with sufficient NH4+ ions. The comparison of P leaching behavior among P-adsorbed LDH, ammonia-treated LDH, and pure struvite samples demonstrates that ammonia desorption probably weakened the interaction between phosphate species and LDH cationic layers, thus enhancing the bioavailability of P in LDH adsorbents. The ammonia-treated LDH has a high potential to serve like struvite as a P slow-releasing fertilizer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One challenge in H2O2 based Fenton-like reaction is to break through the limitation of slow reduction of ferric species (Fe-III). Present work describes a dramatic acceleration of Fenton-like reaction at neutral pH by using calcium peroxide (CaO2) as a source of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and EDTA as a chelating agent of ferric ions. In an optimized condition, phenol degradation in the H2O2 system displayed an initial latent time of 60 min, while phenol can be degraded immediately and removed completely in 30 min in the CaO2 system. Visual MINTEQ analyses indicated Fe-EDTA(-) was the active species in the reaction. The contribution of O-1(2) in CaO2 system was excluded by the poor selectivity in phenol conversion and the comparable (O2-TEMP)-O-1 EPR signals in both CaO2 and H2O2 systems. Kinetic analyses using chloroform as the probe of O-2(-) suggested the high production rate of O-2(-), which is four orders of magnitude higher than that in H2O2 system. The mechanism of the accelerated CaO2 based Fenton-like reactions was featured by that two electrons coming from CaO2 can be utilized to promote reduction of Fe-III: an inner sphere electron transfer takes place to reduce Fe-III-EDTA and produce O-2(-), and subsequently O-2(-) provides an electron to reduce another Fe-III-EDTA. The revealed intrinsic reducibility in CaO2 based Fenton-like reaction represents a new strategy to break through the well-known rate limiting step of Fe-III reduction in Fenton-like reaction and facilitate the removal of organic pollutants at neutral pHs, and also indicates a promising source of O-2(-) for diverse applications.

AB Removal of total polyphenols (TPP) is not only necessary as a pretreatment stepfor anaerobic digestion of wine wastewaters (WWW) but also the recovered polyphenols can be used as a dietary supplement. With a view to make the process sustainable, eco-efficient and cost effective, exhausted grape pomace (EGP) after the extraction of polyphenols was impregnated with ZnCl2 (1:1.5) and further activated at 450 degrees C for 1 h under inert atmosphere. The GPAC (grape pomace activated carbon) thus developed exhibited well-developed porosity with a predominance of micropores, high surface area and selective surface binding sites. Batch adsorption conducted on diluted WWW revealed the better performance of GPAC (84.3% removal) as compared to EGP (48.5% removal) under similar conditions; with maximum adsorption taking place at pH 3.8. While pH studies indicated a possible electron-donor-acceptor mechanism in the binding of TPP, kinetic studies indicated that diffusion was mediated by the porosity in GPAC. Isotherm studies conducted on GPAC and commercial carbon (CAC) revealed multilayer binding under WWW while Langmuir model was operative under simulated conditions. Contrary to the better performance of CAC, the same for GPAC was comparable at higher dosage where >80%TPP was removed from undiluted WWW. The phenol adsorption capacity of GPAC from real (28.4 mg/g) and from simulated wastewater (142.6 mg/g) was higher as compared to other reported adsorbents. Desorption of TPP from loaded GPAC was maximum (similar to 91%) with 1:1 ethanol-water solvent. The results reveal a sustainable eco-friendly solution for valorisation of exhausted grape pomace for recovery of polyphenols from wine wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Haloacetamides (HAMs), an emerging class of disinfection by-products, have received increasing attention due to their elevated cyto- and genotoxicity. However, only limited information is available regarding the iodinated analogues. This study investigated the formation and speciation of iodinated haloacetamides (I-HAMs) and their chlorinated/brominated analogues during the chloramination of bromide and/or iodide-containing waters and a model compound solution over various time periods. The rapid formation of diiodoacetamide (DIAM) was observed during chloramination of three simulated samples, whereas brominated (Br-HAMs) and chlorinated haloacetamides (Cl-HAMs) increased slowly with increasing reaction time. To further understand the differences in the formation of HAMs containing different halogens, experiments with the model compound asparagine in the presence/absence of iodide were conducted. Moreover, iodine utilisation factors and iodine incorporation factors were observed to increase significantly faster and were substantially higher than those of bromine. This implied that, compared with bromide, iodide has substantially greater potential to be transformed to the corresponding HAMs during chloramination, similar to that of other classes of DBPs. That is, I-HAMs formed faster than the other species investigated, including Cl-HAMs and Br-HAMs, in the early reaction stages (0-3 h). The effect of the bromide/iodide ratio (i.e., constant iodide, increasing bromide) on I-HAM formation was also examined. With increasing bromide/iodide ratio, the formation of Br-HAMs increased and dichloroacetamide decreased, but the formation of DIAM was largely unchanged. This was consistent with the constant level of iodide in spite of the increasing bromide. Chlorine and ammonia are applied separately during chloramination in water treatment, so the effect of pre-chlorination (before adding ammonia) on the formation and speciation of I-HAMs during in situ chloramination was also evaluated. Effective mitigation of DIAM formation with in situ chloramination was achieved, and the efficiency improved with increasing pre-chlorination time, where iodide was oxidised to iodate. The HAM associated cytotoxicity was calculated to determine the change in toxicity at different reaction times, bromide/iodide ratios, and pre-chlorination times. A similar trend as the formation of I-HAMs was observed, which increased rapidly in the first 3 h, but decreased somewhat subsequently. When the bromide/iodide ratio and pre-chlorination time was increased, the calculated toxicity of the HAMs increased (due to more formation of Br-HAMs and less Cl-HAMs) and decreased (due to less DIAM formation), respectively.

AB In this study waste activated sludge (WAS) was sonicated to release bacteria-sized volatile solids (VS) from flocs, after initial pH adjustment to 10 for higher energy efficiency. The released VS supported growth of phagotrophic alga Ochromonas danica. Initial-rate growth experiments confirmed the Monod-ype kinetics but the specific cell growth rate, mu, correlated with the prey-to-predator ratio, i.e., the ratio of (fed VS concentration)-to-(initial O. danica concentration), significantly better than with the VS alone, as the typical Monod dependency on soluble substrates. The best-fit kinetics had the following parameters: mu(max) = 0.198 h(-1) and K-M = 1.056 (g-VS/g-algae). Post-sonication reflocculation could render particles too large to ingest by O. danica; therefore, pH and VS effects on reflocculation were investigated. Batch cultivations were then conducted in fermentors at pH 5, under nonsterile conditions. Algae number reached 8.86 x 10(10) L-1 after 20 h, corresponding to similar to 2.3 g/L dry-weight and volumetric algae productivity of 2.8 g/L-day. VS reduction was 38%, giving an O. danica VS yield of 44.5%. The ultrasonication-algae process can be used to produce algae while achieving at least partial WAS treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Estuarine and coastal regions are often characterized by a high variability of suspended sediment concentrations in their waters, which influences dredging projects, contaminant transport, aquaculture and fisheries. Although various three-dimensional open source software are available to model the hydrodynamics of coastal water with a sediment module, the prediction of the fate and transport of cohesive sediments is still far from satisfied due to the lack of an efficient and robust flocculation model to estimate the floc settling velocity and the deposition rate. Single-class and sometimes two-class flocculation models are oversimplified and fail to examine complicated floc size distributions, while quadrature-based or multi-class based flocculation models may be too complicated to be coupled with large scale estuarine or ocean models. Therefore, a three-class population balance model was developed to track the sizes and number concentrations of microflocs, macroflocs and megaflocs, respectively. With the assumption of a fixed size of microflocs and megaflocs, only four tracers are needed when coupled with the open-source TELEMAC system. It enables better settling flux estimates and better addresses the occurrence and concentration of larger megaflocs. This tri-modal flocculation model was validated with two experimental data sets: (1) 1-D settling column tests with the Ems mud and (2) in-situ measurements at the WZ Buoy station on the Belgian coast. Results show that the flocculation properties of cohesive sediments can be reasonably simulated in both environments. It is also found that the number of macroflocs created, when a larger macrofloc breaks up, is a statistical mean value and may not be an integer when applying the model in the field.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a beneficial tool to evaluate the performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and to compare different upgrading options. The main objective of this study is to investigate the environmental impact of upgrading options of a preliminary WWTP in Istanbul, Turkey. The preliminary plant currently consists of mechanical treatment units and various upgrading options including primary treatment and high-rate activated sludge system (HRAS) process as well as the addition of food waste to wastewater were compared. Results showed that the baseline scenario (S0) had worse performance than all future scenarios (S1-3) except for climate change. The scenario of adding food waste to wastewater (S3) has the best performance in climate change, terrestrial acidification, terrestrial ecotoxicity and fossil depletion. Increased addition of food waste was also tested in the sensitivity analysis, and major improvements were obtained especially in climate change and terrestrial ecotoxicity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ensuring the biological stability of drinking water is essential for modern drinking water supply. To understand and manage the biological stability, it is critical that the bacterial growth in drinking water can be measured. Nowadays, advance treatment technologies, such as reverse osmosis (RO), are increasingly applied in drinking water purification where the produced water is characterized by low levels of nutrients and cell counts. The challenge is, therefore, how to measure the low bacterial growth potential (BGP) of such ultra-pure water using the available methods which were originally developed for conventionally treated drinking water. In this study, we proposed a protocol to assess BGP of ultra pure drinking water produced by RO and post-treatment (including remineralization). Natural bacterial consortium from conventional drinking water was added to all water samples during this study to ensure the presence of a wide range of bacterial strains. The method development included developing an ultra-pure blank with high reproducibility to lower the detection limit of the BGP method (50 +/- 20 x 10(3) intact cells/mL) compared with conventional blanks such as bottled spring water, deep groundwater treated by aeration and slow sand filtrate of surface water supply. The ultra-low blank consists of RO permeate after adjusting its pH and essential mineral content under controlled laboratory conditions to ensure carbon limitation. Regarding the test protocol, inoculum concentrations of >10 x 10(3) intact cells/mL may have a significant contribution to the measured low levels of BGP. Pasteurization of water samples before measuring BGP is necessary to ensure reliable bacterial growth curves. The optimized method was used to assess BGP of ultra-pure drinking water produced by RO membranes and post-treatment (including remineralization), where the BGP has decreased more than 6-fold to a level of 90 +/- 20 x 103 intact cells/mL compared with conventionally treated water (630 +/- 70 x 10(3) intact cells/mL).

TI First large-scale ecological impact study of desalination outfall
   reveals trade-offs in effects of hypersalinity and hydrodynamics

AB Desalination is an increasingly common method of meeting potable water demands, but the associated ecological risks are not well understood. Seawater desalination plants discharge large volumes of hypersaline brine directly into the ocean, raising concerns about potential impacts to marine life. In order to reduce impacts of brine, newer desalination outfalls are often fitted with high-pressure diffusers that discharge brine at high velocity into the water column, increasing the mixing and dilution of brine with ocean water. However, there are few published studies of marine impacts of desalination brine, and no well replicated before-after designs. Here we report a six-year study testing for impacts and subsequent recovery of sessile marine invertebrate recruitment near a desalination outfall with high-pressure diffusers. We used a Multiple Before-After-Control-Impact (MBACI) design to test for impacts and recovery at two distances (30 m and 100 m) from a 250 ML/day plant outfall, as well as a gradient design to test the strength of impacts relative to distance from the outfall. The diffusers achieved the target of less than 1 ps mu salinity difference to surrounding ambient waters within 100 m of the discharge outfall, but sessile invertebrates were nonetheless impacted. Polychaetes, bryozoans and sponges reduced in cover as far as 100 m from the outfall, while barnacles showed the opposite pattern and were more abundant near the discharging outfall. Ecological impacts were disproportionate to the relatively minor change in salinity (similar to 1 ps mu), suggesting a mechanism other than salinity. We propose that impacts were primarily driven by changes in hydrodynamics caused by the diffusers, such as higher near-bed flow away from the outfall. This is consistent with flow preferences of various taxonomic groups, which differ due to differences in settlement and feeding abilities. High-pressure diffusers designed to reduce impacts of hypersalinity may inadvertently cause impacts through hydrodynamics, leading to a trade-off in minimizing combined salinity and hydrodynamic stress. This study provides the first before-after test of ecological impacts of desalination brine on sessile marine communities, and rare insight into mechanisms behind impacts of a growing form of human disturbance.

AB Considerable efforts have been made in recent years in developing novel marker genes for fecal pollution tracking in environmental waters. CrAssphage are recently discovered DNA bacteriophage that are highly abundant in human feces and untreated sewage. In this study, we evaluated the host-sensitivity and -specificity of the newly designed crAssphage qPCR assays (Stachler et al., 2017) CPQ_056 and CPQ_064 (i.e., marker genes) in fecal samples collected from various human and several animal host groups in Australia. We also investigated the utility of these marker genes to detect sewage pollution in an urban recreational lake (i.e., Lake Parramatta) in Sydney, NSW. The mean concentrations of CPQ_056 and CPQ_064 marker genes in untreated sewage were 9.43 +/- 0.14 log(10) GC/L and 8.91 +/- 0.17 log(10) GC/L, respectively, 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than other sewage-associated viruses used in microbial source tracking studies. Among 177 animal fecal samples tested from 11 species, the host-specificity values for CPQ_056 and CPQ_064 marker genes were 0.95 and 0.93, respectively. Limited cross reactivity was observed with cat fecal and cattle wastewater samples. Abundance of crAssphage markers were monitored in an urban lake that receives stormwater runoff. The concentrations of both markers were higher (CPQ_056 ranging from 3.40 to 6.04 log(10) GC/L and CPQ_064 ranging from 2.90 to 5.47 log(10) GC/L) in 20 of 20 (for CPQ_056) and 18 of 20 (for CPQ_064) samples collected after storm events with gauged sewer overflows compared to dry weather event (10 of 10 samples were qPCR negative for the CPQ_056 and 8 of 10 were negative for the CPQ_064 marker genes) suggesting sewage pollution was transported by urban stormwater runoff to Lake Parramatta. The results of the study may provide context for management of sewage pollution from gauged overflow points of the sewerage system in the catchment.

AB Reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion is one of the most promising low temperature combustion (LTC) techniques, as it is able to provide ultra-low NOx and soot emissions together with higher thermal efficiency than conventional diesel combustion (CDC) in a wide range of operating conditions. However, the unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emission levels are orders of magnitude higher than CDC, which can result in a major problem for implementing the RCCI concept in real engines. In this sense, the high levels of UHC and CO emissions together with the low exhaust temperatures during RCCI operation could compromise the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) conversion efficiency.
   The objective of this work is to evaluate the efficiency of a conventional DOC in oxidizing the UHC and CO emissions from RCCI combustion. To do this, a medium-duty multi-cylinder diesel engine equipped with its original after treatment system has been used. First, the DOC conversion efficiency is evaluated under some steady-state conditions. Later, the influence of the thermal inertia on the DOC response has been evaluated by means of transient tests. In this sense, different engine load-speed steps as well some simplified conditions from the worldwide harmonized vehicle cycle (WHVC) and the supplemental engine transient cycle (SET) are evaluated. In steady-state conditions, with DOC-inlet temperatures of 200-300 degrees C, the results show conversion efficiencies of 100% for CO and 85-95% for HC. At 10% and 25% load, the DOC-outlet UHC levels are unacceptable considering the EURO VI regulation, while at 50% load the tailpipe emissions fulfill the emissions standard. The results in transient conditions are more promising thanks to effect of the thermal inertia, showing 100% conversion efficiency for CO and greater than 90% for UHC during large periods of engine operation.

AB This paper deals with the cost and energy efficiency for heat and electricity production. The operation of the medium size Combined Heat and Power plant, located in Poland, with diverse production units: steam boilers, water boilers and gas engines is studied. The analysis is performed for spring-autumn season, characterized by relatively low and variable heat power demand. Due to such mutable conditions production units are forced to operate out of the nominal efficiencies. The analysis is performed for heating and electric energy production on: steam boilers and turbo-generator, water boilers, steam boiler and gas engines; and water boiler and gas engines. To reflect the actual situation, a mathematical model for the complete installation is developed. The model calculates energy balance for a given heating power demand profile. The model is based on the actual parameters, including all technical aspects and equipment's limitations. The developed tool enables to select the mode of operation for each production unit separately or in combined mode. As a result, the energy balance in one hour operation period is calculated. Such approach allows to compare the energy production efficiency and cost in each system at every hour.
   Due to the fact, that nowadays heat and electricity production business, is strongly affected by legal regulations, the analysis of gas engines profitability with and without subsidy for natural gas based co-generation is performed.

AB The SOLWAT system, integrating the functions of photovoltaic electricity generation and solar disinfection, was subjected under a microbial kinetic study with the aim of applying system optimizations. E. coli, total coliforms, Enterococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens response and photovoltaic performance vs. conventional PET bottles was studied using river water sources and natural sunlight. Results showed that under strong climatic conditions the time required for the solar disinfection could be reduced by half in the SOLWAT system (3 h), increasing the quantity of treated water and favouring the SOLWAT power output due to the cooling effect of the water being purified on the top of the PV module, which is maximum during the beginning of the 50015 process, so the module could be benefited from lower operational temperatures when using reduced treatments times.

AB The influence of channel dimension and altering dry air inlet conditions such as temperature and humidity on the humidification efficiency of a multi-stage plate-type membrane humidifier for kW-scale proton exchange membrane fuel cells is analyzed in terms of the dew point approach temperature, water recovery ratio, pressure loss, and the coefficient of performance, Investigating the effect of channel dimension reveals that the width and depth of the channel significantly affect the humidification performance. The results show that the increase of dry air inlet temperature and humidity leads to improving the dew point approach temperature, decreasing the water recovery ratio, slight increasing the pressure drop, and consequently decreasing the coefficient of performance. The minimum dew point approach temperature and maximum water recovery ratio occur at the flow rate of 30 L/min. The highest water recovery ratio, 73%, is achieved at the temperature of 50 degrees C and relative humidity of 40%. Moreover, the pressure loss increases with the increment of air flow rate and the coefficient of performance declines with the increase of air flow rate. Thus, it is recommended to select the minimum possible flow rate, dry air inlet temperature, and relative humidity as the efficient operating condition.

AB In Wankel rotary engine (WRE), high mainstream velocity in combustion chamber blocks flame propagating to the end of combustion chamber, which causes high emissions and low combustion efficiency due to unburned mixtures. To solve this problem, a three-dimensional dynamic simulation model of a hydrogen-gasoline blends fueled WRE is built and validated. The in-cylinder mixture formation and combustion process are investigated under different hydrogen injection timing (HIT) and duration (HID) conditions. The study results show that the concentration of hydrogen distributed between the spark plug region and rear combustion chamber increases with retarded HIT and extended HID. Faster flame speeds are obtained for HIT of 110 degrees CA BTDC and HID of 40 degrees CA. At a fixed HID of 20 degrees CA, compared with HITs of 210 and 160 degrees CA BTDC, the peak in-cylinder pressures for HIT of 110 degrees CA BTDC are increased by 14.3% and 6.8%, respectively. At a fixed HIT of 110 degrees CA BTDC, the peak in-cylinder pressure in HID of 40 degrees CA is 52.3% and 9.21% higher than HIDs of 20 and 30 degrees CA. The highest in-cylinder pressure is achieved with the hydrogen injection strategy that HIT of 110 degrees CA BTDC, HID of 40 degrees CA. However, as the temperature increases with pressure, nitrogen oxide emissions are also increased with retarded HIT and extended HID obviously. Considering the lowest carbon monoxide is achieved and the unburned zone in the rear region of combustion chamber is eliminated in HIT of 110 degrees CA BTDC, of 40 degrees CA. The hydrogen direct injection strategy that HIT of 110 degrees CA BTDC, HID of 40 degrees CA acquires the best engine performance in this research.

AB Although single-phase mechanically pumped fluid loop (MPFL) and two-phase spray cooling technologies have been investigated independently for decades, there is a lack of understanding on the combined operation of these two modules. The MPFL has been extensively utilized in the space thermal control system due to its technological maturity and gravity immunity. The spray cooling, which is characterized by the speciality in thermally dealing with the high heat flux equipment, has not gone that far owing to its complexity in the management of the two-phase flow in the space environment. It is also acknowledged that the MPFL, as an overall cooling strategy in the space thermal control system, will not be replaced completely in the foreseeable future because the primary on-board electronic devices require normal heat dissipation demand and only a few equipment such as on-board laser diode and multi-chip modules demand extreme high heat removal technologies. Therefore, a combination of the MPFL and spray cooling technologies, which constitutes the biggest innovation in this paper, is imperatively needed. A hybrid cooling system (HCS) combining the single-phase self-adaptive MPFL and gravity-immune two-phase spray module which satisfies various cooling demands is proposed in the present study. A validating system as a prototype was established on the basis of the optimal design method. Three test cases were conducted to verify the coordinated operation between the single-phase module and two-phase one and investigate thermal performances of both modules. In all the experiments, the controlled temperature of the cold plate in the MPFL remains within a range between 35.9 degrees C and 41.9 degrees C under the heat load from 50 W to 150 W. The highest heat flux acquired by the spray cooling module can be up to 468.8 W/cm(2) with the superheat level being 70.0 degrees C. Results can be drawn that the two modules can be operated simultaneously and independently. Systematic operation efficiency of the proposed HCS is calculated to be 17.7 which displays a high economy of the proposed system.

AB The present study investigates the air-steam gasification of ten commercial and alternative lignocellulosic biomass fuels (pine sawdust, chestnut sawdust, torrefied pine sawdust, torrefied chestnut sawdust, almond shells, cocoa shells, grape pomace, olive stones, pine kernel shells and pine cone leafs) in order to evaluate the product gas composition and the process performance in a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier with focus on the different biomass properties. Accordingly, an effort to correlate the biomass characteristics with the gasification results has been done. Pine kernel shell (PKS) was used to test the effect of the gasification temperature (700, 800 and 900 degrees C), steam to air ratio in the gasifying agent (S/A = 10/90, 25/75, 50/50 and 70/30) and stoichiometric ratio (SR = 0.13 and 0.25) on the product gas composition, combustible gas (H-2 + CO + CH4) production, H-2/CO ratio, heating value, energy yield and cold gas efficiency of the obtained gas. Results showed that higher temperature and S/A ratio favored H-2 production and gasification performance. A higher value of SR slightly affected the gas composition, but led to a higher process efficiency as a consequence of a higher biomass conversion into gaseous combustible products. All the biomass samples of different origin and characteristics were then gasified at the best experimental conditions found (900 degrees C, S/A = 70/30, SR = 0.25). Gasification of all the biomasses was feasible and H-2 and combustible gas concentrations of 30-39 vol% and 59-78 vol% (inert gas-free basis), respectively, were obtained for the biomasses studied, with energy yields of 8-18 MJ/kg(biomass). Torrefied biomass showed similar combustible gas production than the corresponding raw biomass under the conditions studied, but it gave slightly higher H-2 production and efficiency results. Possible correlations of the gasification performance parameters with biomass properties were also analyzed. The results showed positive effects of biomass volatile matter content, C content and high heating value (HHV) on the CO and combustible gas contents, calorific value of the product gas, as well as gas and energy yields.

AB Micro or meso-scale combustors usually operate with premixed combustion due to restricted space available to allow the mixing of fuel and air. In the present study, a recuperative meso-scale non-premixed combustor i, developed for mini gas turbine applications. Experimental and computational analyses are performed to design this meso-scale combustor. An annular heat exchanger is provided around the combustion chamber. The health exchanger consists of eight longitudinal fins. Air at room temperature enters into the heat exchanger and absorb, the heat. Preheated air enters in the combustor through eight holes and fuel enters through central tube. Initially the computational analysis is carried out to design the combustor for different thermal inputs ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 kW and range of equivalence ratios of phi = 0.25 to 1.9. Non-premixed combustion calculations are conducted with the Reynolds Stress turbulence model coupled with the beta-PDF equilibrium along with mixture fraction transport combustion model. Based on the computational analysis, the combustor is built and tested. The design methodology of the combustor, reactants flow patterns and heat transfer characteristics of annular heat ex changer are reported in the present study. Preheat temperature of the air, combustor exit temperature and thing emissions from the combustor exit are measured and analyzed. Results show that the stable combustion is achieved with high thermal intensity and ultra-low emissions.

AB Energy is the most important factor determining the performance of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system because the mission capability of a small UAV is determined by the energy of its power source. For this reason, in this study, a new conceptual design process for a small UAV with a PEMFC system was investigated with respect to energy. The mission profile and requirements for the small (AV were first determined. Five reference aircrafts were selected based on mission requirements, and some input parameters were assumed for conducting analyses based on these reference aircrafts. A constraint analysis was conducted to determine wing loading and power-to-weight ratios. The wing loading and power-to-weight ratios were used for mission analysis to determine the design specifications of the small UAV. The effect of gravimetric power and energy densities of the PEMFC system on the designed UAV endurance was also investigated. Finally, performance targets of the PEMFC system were suggested for a long endurance mission of the small UAV. This study investigated a conceptual design process that can be widely used for the conceptual design of small UAVs with PEMFC systems.

AB In this research, the performance evaluation of methane (CH4) steam reforming in Wall Steam-methane Reformer (WCR), intended to supply hydrogen (H-2) to SOFC, is investigated using homemade code based on 2D numerical modeling. Focus is on the design of the catalyst coating on the walls of reactor. Various designs of nickel-based catalyst coating were closely examined and compared purporting to understand their effect on the WCR efficiency. The WCR designs operate at similar industrial operating conditions and with the same catalyst density. The computations were discussed with respect to the possible improvement on WCR efficiency. Comparing to the worst catalyst design found, the CH4 conversion rate improving is estimated to 31%, which corresponds to 95.8% more in H-2 production. The obtained results are of practical importance for the design of the catalyst coating and saving fuel energy.

AB Based on the mathematical model of the wind supercharged solar chimney power plant combined with seawater desalination (WSSCPPCSD), the velocity field characteristics of basic WSSCPPCSD were analyzed through three-dimensional numerical simulation. To investigate the influence of different structural parameters of system performance, systems with turbines of different blade numbers, installation angles and relative radial clearances, with guide cone or guide vane were also simulated. Unsteady numerical simulations of H-type wind pressure ventilator with different wind wheel blade installation angles were conducted, as well as another helix-type wind pressure ventilator. The results show that the increase of turbine blade number could lead to a reduced freshwater productivity, and the rotational speed corresponding to maximum turbine shaft power shifts in the direction of lower speed. Besides, with the increase of blade installation angle, both the freshwater productivity and the turbine shaft power increase first and then decrease. As the radial clearance of turbine blades increases, the system freshwater productivity increases and the noise decreases, and the turbine shaft power has a maximum value when the relative radial clearance is 2%. The addition of guide cone and guide vane can effectively improve the flow field. As for the wind pressure ventilator, system freshwater productivity and shaft power both increases first and then drops with the increase of wind wheel blade installation angle. In addition, the helix-type wind wheel can improve the self-starting performance of the wind pressure ventilator and decrease the fluctuation of blade torque at the same time, so as to improve the stability.

AB Leading PV system operation at its Maximum Power Point (MPP) is crucial to improve the overall system efficiency and reduce the solar energy cost. In such a sense, this paper presents a closed-loop Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) method based on the combination of a Second Order Sliding Mode Observer (SOSMO) and a traditional PI controller. The particular SOSMO proposed is especially appropriate to deal with finite time power gradient estimation even in the presence of unmodeled dynamics and external perturbations. Based on this estimation, the PI controller is used to quickly drive the PV system to operate on its MPP and tracking its variations. The resulting closed -loop scheme presents a fast tracking dynamics during rapidly changing environmental conditions having good accuracy and a moderate computational burden. The closed -loop system performance is evaluated using representative computer simulations and corroborated through experimental tests.

AB Chromium doped phosphate glass was melted adopting microwave (MW) heating and properties were compared with conventional glass. Standard methods of characterization adopting X-ray diffraction (XRD), density, UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy, Refractive indices (RI), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-Ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) were performed to evaluate the properties of the glasses. XRD analysis confirmed the amorphous nature. Enhanced absorption peaks in UV-Vis spectra at wavelengths 298, 456, 660 and 685 nm suggest higher Cr3+ concentration in MW prepared glass. Alteration in peak intensities and shift in binding energy in XPS confirm the presence of Cr(III) in different coordination and orientation in glass. Spectrophotometric method developing colour complex of Cr[VI] with 1,5-diphenyl carbazide indicates absence of Cr[VI] in the glass. Presence of IR bands due to different phosphate bonds depicts similar structure in both the glasses. Difference in density, RI, and glass transition temperature (T-g) are also observed in MW melted glass. Maximum instantaneous electrical power was 1.4 kW in MW cavity, whereas 4 kW was recorded in resistive heating furnace. Reflected power remains within 15% of forward power. Total melting time was similar to 2 h in MW heating unlike 6-7 h in resistive heating.

AB Using molecular dynamics simulations we examine the system size dependence of the fast dynamics in two model glass forming liquids, one of them a Lennard-Jones mixture for which cooperative fast relaxation has been reported. We find no indication of a temperature-dependent dynamic length scale characterizing these fast dynamics; the size effects in the short time range are temperature independent and the consequence of cutting off of long wavelength acoustic modes. In a molecular liquid exhibiting a clear Johari-Goldstein (JG) relaxation, significant size effects are again present both for the vibrational motion and long-time a relaxation (only the latter having a significant temperature dependence), but absent for the JG relaxation.

AB The present study showed the suitability of bioactive glass-ceramics for application as bioactive coating on Ti based biomedical implants. The desired properties of bioactive glass-ceramic coating were obtained through controlled crystallization. XRD, optical microscopy, SEM in association with EDX data showed the phase composition and morphology of the glass-ceramic coatings. Microhardness distribution across the coated substrates and the scratch resistance property of the coatings were varied for the differently heat treated coated substrates. The bioactivity of the fluroapatite based glass-ceramic coating on Ti6Al4V substrate was investigated in vitro in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. After immersion in SBF solution the glass-ceramic coating surface was characterized by SEM, EDX analysis and the elemental compositional change of the SBF solution was determined by chemical analysis technique. SEM, EDX analysis and chemical analysis indicated that the glass-ceramic coatings reacted with the SBF solution and formed fluroapatite layer on their surfaces.

AB Infrared (IR) optical materials have enabled a broad range of optical sensing and measurement applications in the mid-wave and long-wave IR. Many IR transmitting glasses are based on covalently-bonded selenides and tellurides, such as As2Se3 and GeTe2, which typically have relatively low glass transition temperatures (T-g) on the order of 200 to 350 degrees C. Many applications have working temperatures above the T-g of these materials, which compels the development of new IR materials. This work studies the underlying short-range order (SRO) structure and glass formability of a new family of ionically-bonded sulfide glasses, xBaS + yLa(2)S(3) + (1 - x - y)GeS2, to develop high T-g optical materials with a broad IR transmission range. These sulfide glasses were produced by melting sulfide materials inside evacuated and sealed carbon-coated silica ampoules at 1150 degrees C for 12 h and quenching to room temperature to form glass. Glass samples were then characterized by IR and Raman spectroscopies and differential thermal analysis (DTA). It was found that by increasing the modifier concentration, the predominantly Ge-4 SRO units, the superscript defines the number of bridging sulfur (BS) ions in the tetrahedral network found in GeS2 glasses, are ultimately converted to Ge-0 units at > 40 mol% network modifier content through the generation of non-bridging sulfur (NBS) ions. These molecular ionic units still form a glassy network, with some of the highest reported T-g values to date for a pure sulfide glass. This suggests that this composition has strong ionic bonds between negatively-charged tetrahedral SRO units and the positively-charged modifier cations. While the glass network is depolymerized in the high modifier content glasses though the formation of a high concentration of molecular ionic Ge-0 SRO groups, they are, nevertheless, homogeneous glassy materials that exhibit the largest T-g and Delta T (difference between crystallization temperature, T-c, and T-g) values of glasses in this system, making them the optimal glasses for high T-g IR optical components, including, potentially, refractory IR optical fibers.

AB The Pb1-xNixTiO3 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) nanoparticles are synthesized by sol-gel method and microwave sintering technique. Samples calcinated at 730 degrees C exhibit pseudo-cubic crystal structure, further sintering at 1000 degrees C the samples exhibited tetragonal structure except x = 0.8. The crystallite size is found to be 47-39 nm. Fourier Transfer-Infra Red studies confirm the Pb-Ti-O, Ti-O and Ni-O bond formation of prepared samples. The optical excitation spectrum reveals that the samples have direct allowed energy bandgap values of 2.81 to 2.82 eV. Synthesized samples particle size found to be 1 mu m to 31 nm from High-Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope analysis. The particle size is found to be decreasing on increasing the nickel concentration. X-ray powder diffraction and electron microscope profiles confirmed single phase behaviour of the compounds in lower concentration of nickel. The prepared compounds show nearly spherical shape morphology with an average particle size of 1 mu m to 31 nm which is close to crystallite size determined from the XRPD. The temperature dependent dielectric constant (epsilon) measurement show low values at room temperature and were nominally changes with increasing temperature upto 350 K. The ac electrical study of synthesized samples confirms the negative temperature coefficient of resistance and thermally activated charge carriers are responsible for the high-temperature behaviour. At room temperature prepared samples exhibited superparamagnetic nature. The saturation magnetization (M-s) and coercivity values are found to be 0.08-15.9 emu/g and 236-195 Oe at 15 kG field strength.

AB The atomic level structures of ternary 0.2Na(2)O + 0.8[xBO(3/2) + (1-x)GeO2] glasses have been carefully examined for the first time using a combination of Raman, infrared (IR) and B-11 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopies. It was found that, like in other mixed glass former (MGF) systems, there is an unequal sharing of the sodium oxide between the two glass formers, B and Ge, across this series 0 < x < 1. It is found that for all x > 0, the Na2O preferentially reacts with boron to create a larger number of tetrahedral boron, BO4/2-1 equivalent to B-4, units than would be found for a binary sodium borate glass of the same mole fraction, 0.20, of Na2O. In addition to this higher than expected fraction of B-4 units as determined by the B-11 MAS-NMR measurements, the Raman spectra further suggest the presence of high concentrations of octahedrally coordinated GeO6/2-2, Ge-6, units in the GeO2 rich end of this compositional series, x <= 0.2. Across this series, it is found that there are at most five short range order (SRO) structural units present in these glasses, BO3/2 (B-3), B-4, GeO6/2-2 (Ge-6), GeO3/2O-1 (Ge-3), and GeO4/2 (Ge-4), where the superscript gives the number of bridging oxygens (BOs) bonded to the central atom. The composition, x, dependence of all of these SRO structural units were determined by combining the results all of these spectral techniques and requiring that the total sum of all the negatively charged SRO units balance the positive ( +0.4) charges from the Na+ ions and that the total amount of B balance to 0.8 x, the total amount of Ge balance to 0.8*(1-x), and the total amount of oxygen balance to1.8-0.4 x as required by the stoichiometry of this compositional series.

AB Phosphate glasses due to their properties can be used in many fields like medicine, optics, electronics, environmental protection etc. Unfortunately, pure phosphate glasses have low chemical durability what limits their application. The addition of iron to the glass improves the durability considerably. Glass with composition 60P(2)O(5)-40Fe(2)O(3) have one of the highest chemical resistance. The glass properties are strongly related to the structure of the glass network which can be tested experimentally and also by application of computer simulations.
   In the paper classical molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the influence of the gradual addition of Na2O on the structure of 55P(2)O(5)-30Fe(2)O(3)-15FeO glass. Increasing sodium content in the glass causes depolymerization of the glass network and increasing number of non-bridging oxygens in [PO4] tetrahedra. The number of chemical durable P-O-Fe bridges decreases and they are replaced by P-O-Na. This leads to separation of iron cations from [PO4] units and formation of iron oxides clusters. The network of the glass with over 30 mol % of Na2O consists mainly of separated [PO4] tetrahedra and short pyrophosphate chains of [P2O7](4-). The glass structural properties due to sodium content increase are discussed.

AB Recent studies revealed that metallic ions have therapeutic effects on human bone metabolism and angiogenesis. Thus, in this study, a new magnesium-calcium-silicate glass powder, being doped with copper ions was synthesized through the sol-gel process; the material was termed as 60S7M2Cu. The glass was thermally treated at several temperatures up to 870 degrees C in order to induce crystallization, which would potentially enhance its mechanical and/or biological properties. Structural and morphological characterization, thermal analysis and in vitro apatite forming ability evaluation were performed by X-ray diffraction-XRD, Scanning Electron Microscopy-SEM coupled with Energy Dispersion Spectrometry-EDS, Thermogravimetric Analysis, as well as Fourier Transformed Infrared-FTIR Spectrometry. Moreover, the elemental release was recorded by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy ICP-AES. Experimental results showed that a crystalline hydroxyapatite phase was developed after 3 days in the simulated body fluid (SBF) followed, after 15 days, by the growth of a carbon hydroxyapatite layer, in both untreated glass as well as treated glass-ceramics nearly at all temperatures. At lower temperatures, namely 770 and 800 degrees C, a whitlockite bioactive phase appeared after the immersion in SBF, while a wollastonite crystalline phase emerged when treated at 830 and 870 degrees C without having a negative effect on its apatite forming ability. Copper ions releasing from the glass and glass-ceramics materials was proved to be slow and stable during the whole period of soaking. In this study copper containing glass and glass ceramics, which present apatite forming ability and according to literature possess the capability to induce the release of therapeutic ions with osteogenic and angiogenic capacity, were synthesized. Eventually, after further investigations, this glass composition could be applied in bone tissue engineering, where bioactive materials able to induce simultaneously both osteogenesis and angiogenesis constitute a constant demand.

AB The deformation behavior of MgAl/Mg nanoscale amorphous/crystalline multilayers (NACMs) with equal layer thicknesses of amorphous and crystalline phases under tension loading is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation method. The results show that the plastic deformation mode of NACMs changes from cross generalized shear bands dominated deformation to finally single shear band plastic deformation with the increase of layer thickness, and the plastic deformation of NACMs with medium layer thickness is realized through cooperative interactions among crystalline layer, amorphous layer and amorphous/crystalline interfaces (ACIs), which could be treated as a transition progress. The results indicate that the peak stresses of the NACMs are greater than that of monolithic amorphous regardless of layer thickness, which is likely to result from the increase of the strong crystalline phase and the strengthening effect of the ACIs. The results also reveal that the ductility and strength of NACMs could be improved effectively by choosing the appropriate layer thickness. In addition, the deformation behavior of NACMs is also quantificationally disclosed and analyzed in current study.

AB Bioactive, sol-gel derived borate glasses (SGBGs) can rapidly convert to hydroxy-carbonated apatite (HCA) in simulated body fluid (SBF). The processing conditions and compositional changes in four-component glasses have previously been investigated, yet the effect of certain elements, such as sodium, on the processing and bioactivity has not been explored. Therefore, in this study, a borate substituted Bioglass (R) "45S5" of the formulation (46.1)B2O3-(26.9)CaO-(24.4)Na2O-(2.6)P2O5 ; mol %, was created as the baseline glass and the amount of sodium was incrementally decreased three times, while maintaining the ratio of the other elements, until a sodium-free, three-component composition was generated (61.0)B2O3-(35.6)CaO-(3.4)P2O5; mol%. Decreasing sodium content altered the gelation behaviour, textural properties, and greatly influenced reactivity as measured through gravimetric changes when exposed to water vapour. Furthermore, ion release profiles corresponded with the different glass compositions, however, interestingly, sodium content had very little effect on rate of conversion to FICA in SBF, which was observed to be within 2 h, according to x-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. This study aims to serve as a basis to develop more simplified SGBG systems for tissue engineering applications.

AB Glasses with nominal molar composition 20B(2)O(3)-(80-x)Bi2O3-xFe(2)O(3) (where x = 0-40) were successfully prepared by melt-quenching. These glasses were characterised by multiple techniques including density, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-Ray fluorescence (XRF), Raman, FT-IR and Mossbauer spectroscopies, dilatometry and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Partial replacement of Bi2O3 by Fe2O3 leads to decreasing density and molar volume and a substantial increase in thermal stability, as measured by several parameters, with maximum improvements achieved when x = 10-20. These improvements are accompanied by modest increases in dilatometric softening point. FT-IR and Raman spectra confirm the presence of BO3 and BiO6 structural units in all glasses, with glass structure apparently little affected by Fe2O3. Mossbauer spectroscopy confirms that iron is present partly as 4-fold coordinated Fe3+ in all glasses, with some 5- and/or 6- coordinated Fe3+ sites also present.

AB Heterogeneous bubble nucleation during the production of commercial glasses is one of the negative factors affecting their technology and technical properties. In order to eliminate these bubbles, we conducted extensive research of bubble nucleation in soda-lime-silica glass melts at increasing temperatures and variable redox states of glass. Evolved gas analysis (EGA) coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to identify and evaluate crucial chemical reactions during the melting. The reactions were indicated also by the bubble compositions estimated from bubble contraction during the temperature drop. The fining action of sulfates in the reducing conditions was observed at temperatures between 1200 and 1300 degrees C using high temperature monitoring. This was confirmed by the relatively high average values of the bubble growth rates. In addition, extensive nucleation of bubbles took place at relatively low temperatures. The temperature region of nucleation was determined by monitoring bubble nucleation on the Pt wire immersed in the melt at increasing temperatures. The nucleation of the bubbles in variously reduced glasses has been observed at temperatures even lower than 1300 degrees C which further decreased with the increasing C/SO42- ratio. Next, we tried to clarify whether the process of bubble nucleation at a low redox state of glass was caused by supersaturation of the glass melt by either physically dissolved or chemically bound gases. We suppose that the nucleation of bubbles SO2 around 1300 degrees C can be attributed to the reaction between the sulfate remaining in melts and sulfides which have been formed by reduction reactions.

AB The present work investigates the validity of using the frequency and decay rate of free-free beam vibration, which are measured by the impulse excitation technique (IET), to characterize the viscoelastic properties of glass in the temperature range of glass transition. Based first on the classical Burgers model, we show that the temperature-dependent flow viscosity of borosilicate glass, calculated from the measured frequency and amplitude decay rate of the flexural vibration, agrees very well with the existing data. While for chalcogenide glass, the same calculation approach does not render the similar agreement, and the reason probably lies in non-exponential effects. To comprehend the IET data in the temperature range of glass transition, we propose a simplified theoretical framework for describing the transition from the solid-like to liquid-like viscoelastic behavior and discuss the cause of difference of the rheology behaviors of these two types of glass based on the formulation of non-exponential relaxation.

AB In the present work, Hafnium (Hf) based metallic glasses (MGs) have been developed with copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) as the constituent elements. Glass forming compositions in Hf-Cu-Ni ternary system have been predicted using widely accepted thermodynamic parameters. The resulting compositions were subsequently validated by synthesizing the ribbons by melt-spun technique. Structural transformations of these ribbons were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Existence of amorphous phase in the as-cast ribbons validates the applicability of thermodynamic approach. Further, it was observed that width of the supercooled liquid region (Delta T-x) for Hf-Cu-Ni system varies from 28 K to 69 K. In view of glass forming ability, the applicability of gamma* parameter is discussed for Hf-Cu-Ni system.

AB Oxygen has usually been considered to be detrimental for the glass formation ability and rarely been taken as a main constituent of amorphous alloys. Here, the effect of oxygen on the glass formation of electrodeposited Mo-O binary alloys was systematically investigated by regulating the current density, and the existence of oxygen was found to promote and stabilize the glassy structure. Fully amorphous structure is obtained at the composition of 76 at.% Mo and 24 at.% O, which is close to the Mo-O binary eutectic point. With an increase in the current density from 0.4 to 2.5 A/cm(2), the oxygen content of the deposited films decreases from 24 to 14 at. %, leading to a transition in microstructure from fully amorphous to mixed amorphous/nanocrystalline. In addition, the crystallization behavior and mechanical properties of the as-deposited amorphous Mo76O24 films were studied. The present work not only shows a novel method for producing amorphous alloy with a high refractory metal and oxygen content, but also verifies that oxygen could act as a main constituent in the formation of amorphous alloys.

AB Certain biomaterials are capable of inducing the secretion of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) from cells exposed to their biochemical influence, which plays a vital role in stimulating angiogenesis. Looking for this capacity, in this study three porous glasses were synthesized and characterized. Glass compositions (in mol-%) were: 60SiO(2) (36-2x)CaO-4P(2)O(5) xCuO xSrO with x = 0, 1 or 2.5, respectively, for B60, CuSr-1 or CuSr-2.5 glasses. Cu2+ and Sr2+ ions were added because of the reported biological capabilities of Cu2+ as angiogenic stimulator and Sr2+ as osteogenic stimulator. The objective of this study was to determine the concentration of the glass particles that, being out of the cytotoxic range, could increase VEGF secretion. The viability of cultivated bone marrow stromal cells (ST-2) was assessed. The samples were examined with light microscopy (LM) after the histochemical staining for haematoxylin and eosin (HE). The biological activity of glasses was evaluated in terms of the influence of the Cu2+ and Sr2+ ions on the cells. The dissolution products of CuSr-1 and CuSr-2.5 produced the highest secretion of VEGF from ST-2 cells after 48 h of incubation. The combination of Cu2+ and Se+ lays the foundation for engineering a bioactive glass than can lead to vascularized, functional bone tissue when used in bone regeneration applications.

AB We investigate the sub-T-g relaxation in both the mechanically milled and the quenched As2S3 glasses by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The results show that the sub-T-g enthalpy relaxation pattern of the milled As2S3 glass is similar to that of the quenched glass, but the fictive temperature (T-f) of the former is higher than that of the latter. By performing sub-T-g annealing, we find that the quenched As2S3 glass exhibits the Johari-Goldstein (JG) relaxation, whereas the milled glass shows the relaxation behavior with the activation energy of similar to 32RT(g) that deviates from the average value of 24RT(g) for the JG relaxation. An endotherm occurs prior to the sub-T-g relaxation peak when the milled glass undergoes sufficient sub-T-g annealing (temperature and time). The occurrence of the endothermic pre-peak and the higher activation energy of the milled glass imply its higher structural heterogeneity compared to the quenched glass. The Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectra indicate the existence of the As4S4 clusters and -S-S- chains in both the milled and the quenched glasses, confirming their structural heterogeneity.

AB We employed the Classical Nucleation Theory using a characteristic value of the pre-exponential constant and an average (temperature dependent) interfacial energy and derived an expression to estimate the maximum nucleation rates, I-max, as a function of the reduced glass transition temperatures, T-gr  T-g/T-m (T-g is the laboratory glass transition temperature and T-m is the melting point or liquidus temperature). The theoretical predictions were surprisingly good for 51 out of 54 silicate glass-formers tested and describe well the experimental trend that /mm, strongly decreases with increasing T-gr. This trend, in turn, explains the well-known fact that only silicate glasses having a relatively low T-gr, T-gr< 0.6, show internal homogeneous nucleation in laboratory time/samplesize scales.

AB In this paper, the role of hydrostatic pressure in Al90Sm10 bimetallic glass formation has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations with Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potential. The bimetallic glass is prepared by subjecting the Al90Sm10 alloy to hydrostatic pressure (P = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 GPa) during cooling the melt (cooling rate similar to 1 K/ps) and the variation in glass transition temperature is determined. It is observed that the glass transition temperature rises as applied hydrostatic pressure increases.RDF analysis indicates the enhancement in local ordering of the Al90Sm10 alloy with increasing applied pressure. Voronoi analysis of the bimetallic glass reveal that the glass-transition temperature behavior seems to be greatly influenced by distorted ICO-like structures Z14 < 0, 2, 8, 4 >, Z13 < 0, 1, 10, 2 >, Z13 < 0, 2, 8, 3 >. However, population of T6 motifs (3661 motifs) remains constant irrespective of the variation in applied hydrostatic pressure. This work as a whole provides an insight towards co-relation between glass transition process and applied pressure during cooling along with underlying physics for Al90Sm10 bimetallic glass.

AB Iron doped lithium metasilicate sample was synthesized using a combustion technique and characterized by XRD (X ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), optical, and EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) analyses. The phase purity of the combustion synthesized products was confirmed by XRD analysis. SEM data suggested the formation of a porous compound by virtue of the entrapment of the gases that evolved during the sample synthesis. FTIR data confirmed the formation of Si-O bonds in the system. Optical data confirmed the existence of both divalent and trivalent iron in the system. Characteristic absorption bands in the region 215-270 nm and 535-620 nm were observed due to the presence of Fe3+ in Oh and Td geometry respectively. On the other hand, the presence of bands at 967 and 1442 nm suggested the stabilisation of Fe2+ also in both Oh and Td geometries, respectively. The divalent iron being a non-Kramer ion, could not be observed by EPR. However, strong temperature-dependent EPR signals were observed in the sample owing to Fe3+. By analyzing the EPR data, super-paramagnetic type of behaviour was observed in the system. Furthermore, the relaxation times along with other EPR spectroscopic parameters were estimated for the system.

AB Chalcogenide glasses including As2S3 and Se are known to exhibit a variety of photoinduced deformations such as volume expansions, anisotropic shape changes, and surface ripples. These deformations are produced by photoinduced viscous material flows which are caused by some driving forces, while the origins are controversial. We propose a guiding idea that the driving force arises from atomic and optical mechanisms; the former from structural disordering and intermolecular alignment and the latter from radiation force and torque. Previously proposed models such as Coulombic and electric-gradient forces are criticized. We also compare these deformations with those in azobenzene-containing organic materials.

AB Thermal stabilization of carrot juice components, mainly beta-carotene, has been studied when they are embedded in a silica matrix. The organic components induce structural changes on the inorganic matrix, decreasing the sintering temperature at which stable forms of amorphous silica such as beta-tridymite, and crystalline structures like alpha / beta-cristobalite can be obtained, they also induce the formation of stishovite traces at ambient pressure. We made use of the sol-gel method with a water/TEOS molar ratio of 11 to prepare the silica composite. The characterization of the samples was carried out using X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, emission fluorescence, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Results indicate high thermostability of the composite as a result of the protective function of the photosystem II carotenoids, which tend to delay the gel glass transition removing water at higher temperature than other chlorophyll species embedded in a silica matrix.

AB Quinary tellurite glass system in the percentages of 75TeO(2)-5Li(2)O-10ZnO-(10-x) Nb2O5-xEr(2)O(3) where (x = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.8 mol%) have been prepared and characterized. Both Fourier-transform-in-frared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies were performed to study the structural changes correlated with the glass network. The thermal characteristics of the system were specified which showed a higher thermal stability (> 100 degrees C) due to the formation of more bridging oxygen's (BO's) revealed by (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies. The optical absorption spectra within near UV-visible regions were performed, and exhibited nine absorption bands centered around 1536, 977, 798, 653, 545, 524, 490, 450, and 443 nm corresponding to the I-4(15/2) ground state to the various excited states I-4(13/2), I-4(11/2), I-4(9/2), F-4(9/2), S-4(3/2), H-2(11/2), F-4(7/2),F-4(5/2), and F-4(3/2) respectively. The same measurement also showed increasing values of the optical band gap (E-g) form 2.70 to 2.90 (eV) and decreasing the refractive index (n) from 2.48 to 2.42. Both the extinction coefficient data and the complex dielectric functions of the glasses were estimated. The different optical parameters were distinctly affected by increasing the Er2O3 (mol %) and the structural changes. The radiative properties of the glass were calculated using J-O parameters. The Branching ratio (beta) of I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/2) transition peaked at 1520.48 nm for Er3+ ions has the highest value (1.000) also, the radiative lifetime (tau) of the same transition changed from 1.4510 to 1.8483. The gain cross-section of the laser transition level from (4)G(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) changed from 1.44 x 10(-20) to 1.92 x 10(-20) cm(-1) in the existing glass system. The acquired results exhibited that the existent glass can be a good candidate in the fiber drawing and laser, non-linear optical applications.

AB Fluoro-sulfo-phosphate glasses with rich ligand situations and excellent thermal stability are promising host materials for optically active species, injection moulding and low-temperature sealing, which have received a significant amount of interest in recent years. Herein, the glass-forming regions of such inverted glass systems are predicted via the thermodynamic method. Based on this, the actual glass formation areas are further determined by the experiments. The liquidus and eutectic points of the binary systems are calculated and the deviations in composition between the calculated results and available phase diagrams are determined with a small deviation (< 6 mol%). Meanwhile, the glass-forming regions are derived quantitatively, which are relatively in agreement with the experimental results. These results demonstrate that it is practical to predict the formation regions of fluoro-sulfo-phosphate glass systems based on thermodynamic calculation, providing an effective and predictive method for the development of new glass systems.

AB The amorphous Co70Fe5Si10B15 alloy was studied in terms of thermal and corrosion resistance as well as thermally induced structural transformations, using several structural and thermal analysis techniques and electrochemical measurements. It was shown that the alloy is thermally stable up to around 510 degrees C. Anodic polarization curves of the as-prepared alloy revealed its high corrosion resistance in 0.5 M NaCl, HCl and NaOH solutions. Multistep structural stabilization through the crystallization is manifested as two well defined DSC peaks corresponding to formation of fcc Co, hcp Co, Co23B6, and Co2Si phases, whose microstructural parameters were studied after thermal treatment at different temperatures in the range 25-800 degrees C. TEM and EDX analyses suggested the presence of minor Co-Si phases as well in the crystallized alloy and deformation twinning in the Co23B6 grains. The microstructural transformations exhibited significant influence on the magnetic moment of the alloy. Kinetics of non-isothermal crystallization was studied on the bases of isoconversional principle. Determination of kinetic triplets of individual crystallization steps, based on deconvolution of the complex DSC peaks applying Fraser-Suzuki function, enabled assessment of thermal stability of the alloy and kinetic predictions at different temperatures.

AB We have studied the relationship between ionic conductivity and the ionic radius of A site in 2AO-2TiO(2)-SiO2 (ATSO; A=Ca, Sr and Ba) glasses. Electrical measurements were carried out in the frequency range 100 Hz similar to 30 MHz and temperature range 300-540 degrees C. Raman spectroscopy and differential thermal analysis measurements were also performed. The exponents of the Cole-Cole plot, power-law conductivity and modulus formalisms reveal the nature of ionic transport and the conductivity relaxation. Raman spectroscopic data of ATSO glasses clarify the modification of vibrational networks of silicate and titanate complexes by alkaline-earth metals (Ca, Sr and Ba). The ratio of non-bridging oxygens per tetrahedrally coordinated cations (NBO/T) in the 2CaO- and 2SrO-2TiO(2) SiO2 glasses decreases rapidly, suggesting polymerization of the silicate and titanate networks. The disorder of the glass matrix in 2BaO-2TiO(2) SiO2 glass is greatly reduced with increasing non bridging oxygens per NBO/T and decreasing interionic Coulomb interactions. The conduction mechanisms of dc and ac for all ATSO glasses are the same but the ions hop through a different fractal structured conduction pathway. The dimension of ionic conduction pathway decreases with increasing ionic radius of alkaline-earth metals in ATSO glasses.

AB Formation of CuBr nanocrystals in fluorophosphate glass is investigated for the first time. The features of the nanocrystals nucleation and growth during isothermal treatment of the glass are analyzed based on spectral studies results. The mean size of the CuBr nanocrystals formed via thermo-induced crystallization varies within 7-10 nm. The nanocrystals size of 9 nm is revealed to be critical, below which the CuBr nanocrystals possess cubic structure, and above which the structure of the nanocrystals becomes hexagonal. While during spontaneous nanocrystals nucleation from the glass melt, without additional thermal inducing, the CuBr crystal structure remains cubic regardless of the size. A preliminary explanation of the effects revealed is proposed, assuming the principal role of internal pressure in drops of a copper halide liquid in a glass matrix.

There is overlapping of confined space effects for water bound in voids between nanoparticles with effects caused by the colligative properties of aqueous solution of trifluoroacetic acid in a chloroform medium. The interfacial phenomena determine the temperature behavior of bound water/ice depending on dispersion media features. Contact area between unfrozen water and nanooxide surface is smaller than the specific surface area due incomplete water filling of voids between hydrophilic/hydrophobic nanoparticles. In composites with cAl-100/AM1, there is a tendency of diminution of the contact area of water with hydrophobic nanosilica AM1 and hydrophobic chloroform immiscible with water. This effect changes the temperature behavior of water, which becomes more strongly bound to hydrophilic alumina. The observed effects can be of importance upon practical applications of nanooxide based composites.

AB The temperature and time dependent structure of molten NiP alloy of eutectic composition has been studied by neutron diffraction. Ni particles were found to exist in the melt at temperatures at least up to about 150 degrees above liquidus. The amount varies reversibly as temperature increases but decays slowly with time. Remarkably, particles still exist even after that the melt has been kept more than 30 h at different temperatures in the molten state. The static structure factor and the pair distribution function obtained at 1050 degrees C are presented.

AB Glass samples with a composition of (70-x)CuO-xTiO(2)-30P(2)O(5) (x = 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mol%) were prepared by melt quench method. The FTIR spectra suggest that the glass network becomes compact with the increase of TiO2. The XRD and DTA analysis indicate that the sample with a high content of TiO2 shows increasing tendency to crystallization. All samples were subjected to controlled heat treatments at temperatures set according to the DTA results. The main crystalline phases are Cu-3(PO4)(2), CuTi2(PO4)(3), besides that Cu2P2O7 and CuO phases crystallized in the samples containing 10 and 15 mol% TiO2. Porous bulky skeletons composed of nano-sized spherical CuTi2(PO4)(3) particles were formed after acid treatments of the controlled crystallized samples in H2SO4 solution due to the selective leaching of the crystalline phase(s). The interparticle voids contribute to the meso-and macro-porosity revealed by the N-2-sorption and SEM measurements. The results show that the sample containing 15 mol% TiO2 has the largest BET surface area and pore volume of 25.7 m(2)/g and 0.29 cm(3)/g, respectively, mainly due to the largest amount of Cu-3(PO4)(2) in the crystallized sample, which resulted in the lowest aggregation, smallest particle size of the CuTi2(PO4)(3) nano-particles consisting of the final porous glass-ceramic.

AB Similar to normal indentation studies, structural compaction and shear flow occur also in the lateral deformation of glass surfaces through scratching. Here, we apply instrumented indentation with tangential displacement in order to study the elastic-plastic regime of scratch-deformation on silica, borosilicate and soda lime silicate glasses. We adopt the protocol of volume recovery analysis by high-temperature annealing to determine variations in geometry and volume of the scratch groove before and after the release of scratch-induced densification. While very similar relative recovery behavior is found for both normal indentation and scratch testing, inherent differences occur in the absolute presence of deformation modes across all three types of glass. In particular, caused by shear deformation at the apex of the employed Berkovich scratch tip, pronounced material pile-up occurs in scratching for normal loads which are about one order of magnitude below reference experiments of normal indentation. This leads to an increase in the effective friction coefficient and a non-trivial correlation between the scratch hardness and the normal hardness of glasses.

AB In nature extreme PT-conditions result in numerous glass-like solids, the study of which allows specifying various structural and chemical features of extreme materials, which have a great application potential in various fields of technology. We studied features of nanostructure of natural impact glasses, including recently discovered ultrahigh-pressure high-temperature impact glasses, compared to low-pressure natural and synthetic standard silica glasses. In this paper we presented complex data of atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. We described nanostructural characteristics of impact glasses and showed influence of chemical composition on the features of their structure. We discovered that the elemental composition was the most important factor determining the glasses nano-heterogeneity. We noted an essential role of influence of Na impurity on glass nanostructure, The impact glasses with pure SiO2 composition have the smallest sizes of nanostructural elements.

DE Metallic glass; Segregation; Ca-Zn systems
ID MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; ATOMIC-STRUCTURE; ORDER
AB Solidification of the Ca72Zn28 melt is achieved by using both the thermal quenching and rapid pressurizing techniques in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations within a generalized gradient approximation. A chemical segregation process is perceived in the Ca72Zn28 system and hence the resulting configurations show nanosized glassy domains with different compositions. The structural and mechanical properties of both Ca72Zn28 metallic glasses have been probed by using various analyzing methods. Although the mean coordination number of the both models is found to be fairly close to each other, a careful investigation exposes that they have a different short-range order around Zn atoms. It appears that pressurizing significantly affects the environment of Zn atom, suppresses the occurrence of Zn-centered ideal icosahedral polyhedrons and retains the Zn centered tri-capped trigonal prism like configurations. On the other hand, the impact of pressure on the environment of Ca atoms is found to be not too drastic. The computer-generated models represent slightly different mechanical properties. The model obtained using the rapid pressurizing technique is stiffer than the one produced using the thermal quenching technique.

ID NUCLEATION; XANES; KINETICS; DENSITY; SI
AB We present the first Li K-edge XANES study of a varied suite of lithium silicate (LS) and lithium alkaline-earth silicate (LMS) glasses. The LS series contains three glasses with compositions LS4 (20 Li2O-80 SiO2), LS2 (33 Li2O-67 SiO2) and LS1.5 (40 Li2O-60 SiO2) and the LMS series is comprised of four glasses of compositions 20 Li2O-20 M2O-60 SiO2 where M = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba. The spectra were compared to those of known salts and minerals, particularly to lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3). Crystalline lithium metasilicate has a sharp, strong intensity absorption edge whereas the lithium silicate glasses all have a weak intensity edge feature, similar to that of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3). The intensity of the edge is governed by the existence of a 2p electron and can be correlated with the ionicity of the Li-0 bond. Therefore, the bonding environment in LS glasses differs considerably from their crystalline counterparts. The area of the absorption edge peak increases with the lithium content of the LS glasses. As for the LMS glasses the edge peak changes drastically depending on the alkaline-earth present. The peak area of the LMS glasses decreases with increasing charge density (Z/r(2)) from barium to magnesium. The area of the absorption edge peak in the LS glasses is larger than that of the LMS glasses. Thus, the addition of alkaline-earth elements to lithium silicate glasses modifies the glass network differently depending on the specific element, which in turn creates an altered lithium bonding environment as evidenced by their Li K-edge XANES spectra.

The glasses have been prepared via melt quenching route. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been done to obtain the band positions and functional groups for all the pristine as well as heat treated glasses, respectively. UV-visible spectroscopy has been performed to obtain the band gap, Urbach energy and refractive indices for all the pristine as well as heat treated glasses. The parameters like density/molar volume have been calculated with the varying La2O3/Y2O3 (X) ratio. Also, some theoretical parameters like electronegativity of metal ion/oxide ion, interionic distance, ionic concentration, optical basicity and polarizability have been calculated. The parameters like average cross link density, average force stretching constant, bulk modulus and number of network bonds per unit volume have also been calculated. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra have also been obtained for all the glass samples to determine the magnetic behavior as well as g values (spin Hamiltonian parameters). The optical basicity of all the glasses lies within the range of 0.621-0.631. All the pristine glasses exhibit band gap energy ranging from 5.80 to 5.89 eV.

AB We have developed a numerical model based on finite element analysis (FEA) with a viscoelastic material model coupling stress relaxation and structural relaxation, using the Mauro-Allan-Potuzak (MAP) non-equilibrium viscosity equation as the shift function. A modeling study of the delayed elasticity behavior in glass under different equilibrium viscosity and non-equilibrium viscosity conditions is conducted. The delayed elastic response is found to be well described by a stretched exponential function with three parameters: the maximum delayed elasticity response, the retardation time of delayed elasticity response, and the stretching exponent of delayed elasticity response. The delayed elasticity magnitude is seen to increase with lower values of the stretching exponent b(stress). At equilibrium viscosity, the retardation time shows a linear relationship with the stress relaxation time. However, when the temperature drops sharply in the non-equilibrium viscosity cases, the delayed elastic response may be frozen resulting in a lower magnitude for the delayed elasticity and the retardation time is not linear any more with the stress relaxation time. The delayed elasticity stretching exponent is seen to vary slightly at different relaxation times and normalized delayed elasticity response can roughly be collapsed into a single master curve. The impact of liquid fragility is also studied.

AB Slag beads with different amorphous phase contents can be prepared by gas quenching of blast furnace slag (BFS). The amorphous phase content can affect the activity of these slag beads, with higher amorphous phase contents leading to higher activity. In this study, thermodynamic simulations with FactSage 7.1 and differential scanning calorimetry were used to investigate the crystallization behavior of BFS during continuous cooling. The influence of different cooling rates and basicities on the crystallization behavior of BFS was studied, and the activation energy for crystallization was calculated by the Kissinger and Ozawa methods. The results showed that the precipitation of crystals could be prevented at high cooling rates and low BFS basicity. Accordingly, no precipitation of BFS crystals was observed when basicity was less than 0.91 and the cooling rate was above 50 degrees C/min. In addition, the activation energy for crystallization of BFS decreased with increasing basicity

AB Dielectric properties of heavy metal oxide glass system viz., PbO-Bi2O3-SiO2 mixed with varied concentration of NiO are studied as functions of frequency and temperature. The dielectric parameters viz., epsilon', tan delta, sigma(a.c). are observed to increase with NiO content. Electric moduli formalism is adopted for the analysis of dipolar relaxation effects. Impedance plots drawn for the glasses doped with different NiO concentrations pointed out decreasing value of electrical impedance of the glass samples with increase of NiO content. Activation energies for dipoles and for a.c. conductivity are found to decrease, whereas the concentration of defect energy states N(E-F) is increased with increase of NiO content. Quantitative analysis of these results along with those of spectroscopic studies indicated that with increase of NiO concentration there is gradual growing presence of Ni2+ modifier (O-h) ions in the glass matrix. As modifiers these ions are anticipated to stimulate structural defects by depolymerizing the glass network. The increasing degree of disintegration of the glass network is predicted to facilitate for diffusion of conducting ions in the bulk glasses. Finally, it is concluded that in spite of the fact that the host glass is a heavy dense glass (composed of multi component heavy metal oxides with low mobile charge carriers) which has got plenty of other applications in optically operated devices, it is more conducive even for easy diffusion of Ni2+ ions that contribute to ionic conductivity. In view of these observations it is concluded that the studied glass may be considered as ionic conducting material to be used in solid electrolytes.

AB Chalcogenide glass - silver heterostructures are candidates for photoresist and diffractive optical applications. To optimize their processing, we report the kinetics of Ag photo-dissolution in As2S3 matrix using in-situ optical transmission/reflection measurements and real time atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging under optical illumination. The results indicate that photo-dissolution occurs in three stages with the extent and kinetics of each stage depending strongly on Ag film thickness. By contrast, the photo-dissolution is found to be independent of As2S3 matrix thickness. The extent of three stages also depends strongly on the laser dose and can be reduced to two stages at higher laser fluence. A comparative study of two oppositely stacked sample configurations: As2S3/Ag/glass and Ag/As2S3/glass show that the heterostructures respond differently to light illumination. For the former, Ag dissolves completely into As2S3 matrix at a faster rate than for the latter case. The origin of this difference is established by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and AFM measurements.

AB Amorphous Zr54Cu46 and Zr27Hf27Cu46 thin-film metallic glasses were prepared by non-reactive magnetron co-sputtering of Zr, Hf and Cu in pure argon. Several as-deposited Zr54Cu46 films were post-annealed in high vacuum to create a crystalline thin-film alloy of the identical composition. The non-isothermal crystallization behavior of the amorphous Zr54Cu46 and Zr27Hf27Cu46 films and the effect of a substitution of Hf for Zr on the crystallization process were studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The activation energy of the crystallization was obtained by the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose method. The results show that the activation energy of the Zr27Hf27Cu46 film was higher for all conversion fractions, which indicates that the substitution of Hf for Zr enhances the thermal stability of the glassy state. Considerable attention was also paid to the isothermal oxidation behavior of the amorphous and crystalline Zr54Cu46, and amorphous Zr27Hf27Cu46 films investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. It was shown that all oxidation curves in the temperature range from 400 to 575 degrees C obeyed the parabolic law. The activation energy of the oxidation process determined by the Arrhenius equation for the oxidation rate constants was found to be the highest for the Zr27Hf27Cu46 film, which indicates that its surface oxide layer is a more effective barrier against the diffusion of species.

AB This account of issues in the field of nanotechnologies for specific drug delivery is concerned mainly with its diverse literature. It is a prelude to proposing guidelines to ensure that papers are written acknowledging first the complexity of the task, and second that as there is no such thing as a generic nanoparticle, nor a typical drug, nor standard targets, generalisations are rarely possible. The objective is to discuss some trends which have led to over-confident extrapolations of experimental work in animals to treatment. It is argued that a greater appreciation of the physics, biology and pharmaceutics involved could clarify the sense of any work done and the manner in which this is conveyed in publications. The essential content to be addressed in publications is outlined.

AB Nanoparticle drug delivery system improves the therapeutic efficacy of a drug; however, achieving sustained release from nanoparticles is challenging, owing to the increase of surface area and pronounced burst release. In this study, by incorporating an organogel of 12-hydroxystearic acid (12-HSA) into lipid-bilayers, a gel-liposomal formulation was developed to sustain drug release over time. The lipid-bilayer-coated nanogels (LBCNs) with a particle size of approximately 200 nm and with a core-shell structure had an entrapment efficiency of up to 80% for paclitaxel. LBCNs could continually release both hydrophobic and water-soluble drugs over time. Interestingly, the incorporation of organogel enhanced the cellular uptake of liposomes significantly and, accordingly, enabled improved cytotoxicity of chemotherapy agent against the cancer cells. In conclusion, by formulating the organogel into the lipid bilayers, gel-liposomes were developed, allowing for sustained drug release, improved internalization and the resultant enhancement of cytotoxicity of chemotherapy agent to cancer cells.

AB Combined micro-and nanosystems are appealing for pulmonary protein delivery, fulfilling the specific physiological requirements for efficient outcomes in-vivo. However, fabrication of protein formulations may impose stresses perturbing protein conformational stability and, hence, biological activity. Herein, a protein, insulin (INS), was nanoencapsulated inside chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs) by ionic gelation. By spray drying, the resultant protein-loaded NPs were further encapsulated with a thermoprotectant into powders bearing adequate aerodynamic properties for lung delivery. Structural modifications and interactions of the protein/carrier system were investigated following processing, with special emphasis on protein integrity. Accordingly, physicochemical, elemental, structural and thermal experiments were performed. The analyses revealed the localization of a proportion of the protein on the NPs' surface following nanoencapsulation, and the involved molecular interactions between the NPs and thermoprotectant after microencapsulation. Protein integrity was conserved throughout the preparation processes. This highlights the non-invasiveness of the fabrication techniques, particularly spray drying, for preparing micro-nanosystems for effective administration of inhalable macromolecules.

AB The flow of particulate materials is critical during processes such as mixing, compression and packing. Non-cohesive arching, a feature characteristic of coarse and free-flowing particles, has been studied extensively for silos and hoppers. However, the arching of powders during die fill has received much less attention. In this study, die fill performance of coarse and free-flowing nonpareils was evaluated using a specially designed die filling device in order to investigate the impact of non-cohesive arching during die fill under gravity flow. Through evaluating die fill performance, the arching phenomenon during dynamic conditions of die fill could be captured. Nonpareils with large particle size increased the likelihood of arching and caused poorer die fill performance for narrow orifices. In contrast, die fill in large orifices was generally better with larger particles due to reduced inter-particulate friction. Both particle size and size distribution influenced non-cohesive arching during die fill. Forced feeding did not appear to affect die fill performance and non-cohesive arching. A critical particle size range beyond which die fill performance would decrease, particularly for the narrow orifices, was identified. Findings from this study provided a better insight into non-cohesive arching during die fill.

AB The material residence time distribution in a continuous manufacturing process can be utilized to develop, design and justify the process control strategy. This paper successfully demonstrates using both major and minor formulation component step changes to determine the system response using either Near Infrared Spectroscopy or process parameters. These options provide development flexibility to determine the system's material residence time earlier in the development process and more cost effectively.

AB Multiparticulate formulations based on pellets, granules or beads, could be advantageous for paediatrics, geriatrics and patients with swallowing difficulties. However, these formulations may require suitable administration media to facilitate administration. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of administration media properties on palatability and ease of swallowing of multiparticulates. A range of vehicles were developed using xanthan gum (XG) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as model hydrocolloids. Such vehicles were prepared at three consistency levels (Level 1 - 'syrup', Level 2 - 'custard' and Level 3 - 'pudding') to investigate the effect of viscosity on their performance as administration media. A randomised, single-blind sensory evaluation study was carried out in thirty healthy adult volunteers using microcrystalline cellulose pellets as model multiparticulates, dispersed in the hydrogels (and water as control) at a concentration of 250 mg in 5 ml. Samples were evaluated using 5-point scales. The use of hydrogels as administration media improved a range of sample attributes compared to water formulations, including appearance, taste, mouthfeel, ease of swallowing and residue in the mouth (all improved by ca. 0,5 points) and oral grittiness perception (improved by ca. 1 point). Polymeric hydrogels thickened to medium consistency (Level 2, XG 0.5% and CMC 1.0% w/v) demonstrated the best performance.

AB Ball Milling technique has been used to prepare for the first time Vitis Vinifera extract-silica nanocomposites (VV-SiO2 NCs), which combine the pharmacological effects of the extract with the effectiveness of silica as drug delivery system and active component in the treatment of wound healing. Different contents (1.0, 9.0 and 33.0 wt%) of Vitis Vinifera ethanolic extract were loaded into the silica matrix by grinding the extract with fumed silica using a planetary mill apparatus. The effect of the starting mixture composition and milling time on the final products was examined. The efficiency of the milling process was studied by X-ray Powder Diffraction, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and Infrared Spectroscopy, indicating that the natural extract was not affected by the increasing of the milling time. The successful loading of the extract was demonstrated by Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements, which showed a decrease in the SSA and pore volume of the silica with the increasing of the extract amount. Morphology of the nanocomposites, investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy, showed an increased agglomeration in the nanocomposites with the increment of the VV extract amount. Studies on the total phenol quantification and antioxidant activity of the natural extract before and after incorporation in the silica matrix were also carried out. The obtained results indicate that the milling process does not alter the VV extract components, which result to be embedded in the silica matrix. An increase of the antioxidant activity with the increment of the extract amount in the nanocomposites, up to values comparable to the pure VV extract, was also observed.

   POLYMER INTERACTION
AB The present study explores the hypothesis that a polymer can affect the thermal stability of a drug in solid polymer-drug dispersions. The hypothesis is tested in a systematic fashion by combining isoconversional kinetic analysis with thermogravimetric measurements on several solid dispersions. Experimental systems involve three drugs: indomethacin (IMC), felodipine (FD), and nifedipine (ND) and their solid dispersions with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). It is found that PVP stabilizes IMC but destabilizes FD and ND. Isoconversional kinetic analysis provides insights into the origin of the observed effects. The enhanced thermal stability of IMC in the PVP matrix is associated with an increase in the activation energy of the respective degradation process. A detrimental effect of the PVP matrix on the stability of FD and ND has been linked to a decrease in the activation energy and an increase in the preexponential factor, respectively. The molecular underpinnings of the observed effects are discussed. It is concluded that the effects in question are of relevance for drug performance and need to be taken into account in preformulation studies.

AB The nanomicelles have recently drawn a great deal of attention for drug delivery into the skin. However, these carriers have only deposited in hair follicles and furrows, and drug in the micelles may not therapeutically reach into viable skin layers. The aim of this study was to formulate a combination of nanomicelles with terpenes to overcome this challenge and evaluate their potential for topical drug delivery into the skin. The nanomicelles were characterised with respect to size, size distribution (PDI), zeta potential, morphology and encapsulation efficiency (%). The drug accumulation and penetration were examined by tape stripping method in the skin. The colloidal stability of nanomicelles was followed with respect to size and PDI values. The nanomicelles were about 25-30 nm in size with narrow distribution. All of them had slightly negative surface charge, spherical shapes and high encapsulation efficiency (%). The tape stripping data revealed that nanomicelles consisting of terpinolene led to accumulation of more drug in the stripped skin as compared with commercial product and nanomicelles without terpene. Also, micelle formulations consisting of terpinolene (2.0%) had the highest colloidal stability. Consequently, combination of nanomicelles with terpinolene could be a feasible approach for enhancement of skin drug delivery.

AB Oromucosal drug delivery is necessary when a local effect in the oral cavity is required. Bioadhesive formulations should be advantageous because a larger fraction of the active principal is retained at the site of action allowing for an enhanced and prolonged effect. Despite a variety of mucoadhesion test systems being described in literature, none of these in-vitro tests does relate to physiological conditions in the oral cavity and suites for the testing of complete dosage forms, e.g. tablets. The novel mucoadhesion test is based on porcine buccal mucosa. Constituents, osmolality and pH of the used artificial saliva was as close as possible to physiologic conditions and the flushing rate was equivalent to the physiological secretion rate of saliva. Suitability of the novel test was evaluated with ODTs with live probiotic bacteria as the active principle. With the novel test system, it was shown that in the presence of mucoadhesive polymers (Carbopol (R), Metolose (R) and chitosan) up to 36% of the probiotic bacteria adhered to the mucosa corresponding to a two-or threefold increase compared to tablets without such polymers. Furthermore, the influence of the tablet size (contact area) on the mucoadhesive properties could be resolved.

AB The purpose of this work was to describe the closed loop in situ perfusion method in rats and to compare the difficulties and advantages with other methods proposed by regulatory agencies for BCS classification and finally to illustrate its application to evaluate the permeability of digoxin at relevant clinical concentrations. Digoxin was evaluated at two concentration levels: 1.0 mu g/ml (with and without sodium azide 65.0 mu g/ml) and 6.0 mu g/ml. These concentrations correspond to the ratio of the highest dose strength (0.25 mg) and the highest single dose administered (1.5 mg) and the 250 ml of water. In situ closed loop perfusion studies in rats were performed in the whole small intestine and also in duodenum, jejunum and ileum segments to evaluate the relevance of P-gp secretion in the overall permeability. A kinetic modelling approach involving passive permeation and efflux transport mechanism allowed the estimation of the passive diffusional component and the Michaelis-menten parameters. The estimated K-m value demonstrated that at clinical luminal concentrations the efflux process is not saturated and then it could be inhibited by other drugs, excipients or food components leading to the already reported clinical drug-drug and drug-food interations. The present data confirms from a mechanistic point of view these interactions.

AB This study aimed at investigating the potential mechanism of improved transportation of the curcumin loaded D-alpha-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate coated nanodiamonds system (NDs/CUR/TPGS complexes) using an in vitro Caco-2 cell monolayer model. The core-shell structured NDs/CUR/TPGS nanocomplexes were 196.32 +/- 5.76 nm in size, with a high loading efficiency of 81.59 +/- 3.42%. Cytotoxicity results suggested that the blank NDs did not induce any serious toxicity on Caco-2 cells even after incubated for 72 h. The cell viability for all the series of CUR loaded preparations was found to follow the sequence of CUR suspension > NDs/CUR > NDs/CUR/TPGS. Confocal laser fluorescence microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry system (FACS) studies confirmed that the cellular uptake of NDs could be efficiently enhanced by TPGS decoration. The transport mechanism of NDs/CUR and TPGS coated ones was mainly through an energy dependent, clathrin-mediated and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and the endocytosis of NDs/CUR was also via macropinocytosis. Furthermore, the P-app value (AP-BL) of NDs/CUR and NDs/CUR/TPGS was 2.09- and 3.86-fold higher than that of the CUR suspension. All the results demonstrated that the pharmacological activates and intestinal permeability of CUR across Caco-2 cell monolayer was greatly enhanced by NDs/CUR/TPGS nanocomplexes. Thus NDs could be a promising oral drug delivery platform for improving the intestinal permeability and oral bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs.

AB The process of milling often results in amorphization and the physical stability of amorphous phase is linked with its molecular dynamics. This study focuses on a propensity of two disaccharides (lactose and sucrose) to amorphize on ball milling and the stability of the resultant amorphous phase. The amorphous content in milled sugars is estimated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and the stability was measured in terms of the tendency to recrystallize by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS). The results show that the amorphous content increases with milling time and is greater for lactose than sucrose. At the same degree of amorphization, sucrose recrystallize at temperature similar to 15 degrees C higher than lactose, indicating higher stability. The molecular dynamics (beta relaxation process), suggest that milled sucrose is more stable with higher activation energy (similar to 9 kJ mol(-1)) than that of lactose. The moisture content of amorphous phase also impacts its molecular dynamics in terms of increase in activation energy as the moisture decrease with increasing the milling times. The study suggests a greater stability of amorphous sucrose and susceptibility of milled lactose to recrystallize, however, on extended milling when the moisture content decreases, lactose was seen to become relatively more stable.

AB Successful immunization often requires a primer, and after a certain lag time, a booster administration of the antigen. To improve the vaccinees' comfort and compliance, a single-injection vaccine formulation with a biphasic pulsatile release would be preferable. Previous work has shown that such a release profile can be obtained with compacts prepared from physical mixtures of various poly(DL-lactic(-co-glycolic) acid) types (Murakami et al., 2000). However, the mechanism behind this release profile is not fully understood. In the present study, the mechanism that leads to this biphasic pulsatile release was investigated by studying the effect of the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer, the temperature of compaction, the compression force, the temperature of the release medium, and the molecular weight of the incorporated drug on the release behavior. Compaction resulted in a porous compact. Once immersed into release medium with a temperature above the Tg of the polymer, the drug was released by diffusion through the pores. Simultaneously, the polymer underwent a transition from the glassy state into the rubbery state. The pores were gradually closed by viscous flow of the polymer and further release was inhibited. After a certain period of time, the polymer matrix ruptured, possibly due to a build-up in osmotic pressure, resulting in a pulsatile release of the remaining amount of drug. The compression force and the molecular weight of the incorporated drug did not influence the release profile. Understanding this mechanism could contribute to further develop single-injection vaccines.

AB In this paper, we presented a simple yet versatile strategy to generate a high drug payload nanoparticles by the combination with small molecular assembly and polymeric assembly for topical suppression of ocular inflammation. Upon physical mixing of the succinated triamcinolone acetonide (TA-SA) supramolecular hydrogel with the poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (epsilon-caprolactone)-poly (ethylene glycol) (PECE) aqueous solution at 37 degrees C, TA-SA/PECE nanoparticles formed spontaneously and characterized thoroughly by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The formed TA-SA/PECE nanoparticles displayed a comparable in vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy to that of native triamcinolone acetonide (TA), through a significant downregulation of various proinflammatory cytokines levels (e.g., NO, TNF-alpha) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) actived RAW264.7 macrophage. Meanwhile, the enhanced transcorneal drug permeability of TA-SA/PECE nanoparticles over that of TA suspension was clearly observed in an isolated rabbit cornea. Intraocular biocompatibility test demonstrated that TA-SA/PECE nanoparticles presented good biocompatibility after topical instillation during entire study period. More importantly, the TA-SA/PECE nanoparticles displayed superior therapeutic efficacy over that of the TA suspension in the endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) rabbit model via decreasing neutrophil infiltration in anterior chamber. Overall, the proposed TA-SA/PECE nanoparticles might be a promising candidate for uveitis therapy.

AB The comparison of spray drying versus hot melt extrusion (HME) in order to formulate amorphous solid dispersions has been widely studied. However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of both techniques to form cocrystals within a carrier excipient has not previously been compared. The combination of ibuprofen (IBU) and isonicotinamide (INA) in a 1:1 M ratio was used as a model cocrystal. A range of pharmaceutical excipients was selected for processing - mannitol, xylitol, Soluplus and PVP K15. The ratio of cocrystal components to excipient was altered to assess the ratios at which cocrystal formation occurs during spray drying and HME. Hansen Solubility Parameter (HSP) and the difference in HSP between the cocrystal and excipient (Delta HSP) was employed as a tool to predict cocrystal formation. During spray drying, when the difference in HSP between the cocrystal and the excipient was large, as in the case of mannitol (Delta HSP of 18.3 MPa0.5), a large amount of excipient (up to 50%) could be incorporated without altering the integrity of the cocrystal, whereas for Soluplus and PVP K15, where the Delta HSP was 2.1 and 1.6 MPa0.5 respectively, the IBU:INA cocrystal alone was only formed at a very low weight ratio of excipient, i.e. cocrystal: excipient 90:10. Remarkably different results were obtained in HME. In the case of Soluplus and PVP K15, a mixture of cocrystal with single components (IBU and INA) was obtained even when only 10% excipient was included. In conclusion, in order to reduce the number of unit operations required to produce a final pharmaceutical product, spray drying showed higher feasibility over HME to produce cocrystals within a carrier excipient.

AB Selenomethionine is an essential amino acid with a narrow therapeutic index and susceptibility to oxidation. Here it was encapsulated into a nanoparticle composed of chitosan cross-linked with tripolyphosphate for oral delivery. The formulation was optimised using a three-factor Box-Behnken experimental design. The chitosan: tripolyphosphate ratio, chitosan solvent pH, and drug load concentration were independently varied. The dependent variables studied were encapsulation efficiency, particle size, polydispersity index and zeta potential. For optimisation, encapsulation efficiency and zeta potential were maximised, particle diameter was set to 300 nm and polydispersity index was minimised. A 0.15 mg/mL concentration of selenomethionine, chitosan solvent pH of 3, and chitosan: tripolyphosphate ratio of 6:1 yielded optimum nanoparticles of size 187 +/- 58 nm, polydispersity index 0.24 +/- 0.01, zeta potential 36 +/- 6 mV, and encapsulation efficiency of 39 +/- 3%. Encapsulation efficiency was doubled to 80 +/- 1.5% by varying pH of the ionotropic solution components and by subsequent coating of the NPs with zein, increasing NP diameter to 377 +/- 47 nm, whilst retaining polydispersity index and zeta potential values. Selenomethionine-entrapped nanoparticles were not cytotoxic to intestinal and liver cell lines. Accelerated thermal stability studies indicated good stability of the nanoparticles under normal storage conditions (23 degrees C). In simulated gastrointestinal and intestinal fluid conditions, 60% cumulative release was obtained over 6 h.

AB Nonionic surfactants commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations may have P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibiting and/or permeation enhancing effects. The present work aims to distinguish these effects and assess the degree of cellular recovery after multiple exposures to nonionic surfactants. The investigated surfactants were polysorbates (PS): PS20, PS40, PS60, PS65, PS80 and PS85; monosaccharide-based: lauroyl methyl glucamide and n-nonyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside; or disaccharide-based: lauryl-beta-D-maltoside and trehalose 6-laurate. Bi-directional permeability studies of digoxin and mannitol, and calcein-AM efflux assay were performed in cell cultures. Cellular recovery was evaluated by continuous measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Polysorbates with one fatty acid chain decreased the efflux of digoxin through P-gp inhibition in MDCKII MDR1 cells. Mono- and di-saccharide-based surfactants, in a dose dependent manner, enhanced digoxin absorptive permeability without decreasing the secretory permeability in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the surfactants had a transcellular permeation enhancing effect. Caco-2 cell monolayers recovered to different degrees of 60-100% of the initial TEER values. Calcein-AM assay was found to be non-predictive to surfactants influence on digoxin permeability across cell monolayers. In conclusion, these results may assist, in a mechanism-based, selection of suitable surfactants for formulating oral dosage forms to enhance the absorption of low bioavailable P-gp substrates.

AB Endothelial cells are main components of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and form a tight monolayer that regulates the passage of molecules, with the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters efflux pumps. We have developed a human in vitro model of HBEC-5i endothelial cells cultivated alone or with human astrocytes conditioned medium on insert. HBEC-5i cells showed a tight monolayer within 14 days, expressing ZO-1 and claudin 5, a low apparent permeability to small molecules, with a TEER stability during five days. The P-gp, BCRP, MRPs transporters were well expressed and functional. Accumulation and efflux ratio measurement with different ABC transporters substrates (Rhodamine 123, BCECF AM, Hoechst 33342) and inhibitors (verapamil, Ko143, probenecid and cyclosporin A) were conducted. At barrier level, the functionality of ABC transporters was three-fold enhanced in astrocyte conditioned medium. We validated our model by the transport of pharmacological substrates: caffeine, rivaroxaban, and methotrexate. The rivaroxaban and methotrexate were released with an efflux ratio > 3 and were decreased by more than half with inhibitors. HBEC-5i model could be used as relevant tool in preclinical studies for assessing the permeability of therapeutic molecules to cross human BBB.

AB The optimisation of the pharmaceutical properties of carboxylic acid drugs is often conducted by salt formation. Often, the salt with the best solubility is not chosen due to other factors such as stability, solubility, dissolution and bioavailability that are taken into consideration during the preformulation stage. This work uses advanced imaging techniques to give insights into the preformulation properties that can aid in the empirical approach often used in industry for the selection of salts. Gemfibrozil (GEM) was used as a model poorly soluble drug. Four salts of GEM were made using cyclopropylamine (CPROP), cyclobutylamine (CBUT), cyclopentylamine (CPENT) and cyclohexylamine (CHEX) as counterions. DSC, XRD and SEM were used to confirm and characterise salt formation. IDR obtained using UV-imaging up to 10 min for all the salts showed that an increase in the chain length of the counterion caused a decrease in the IDR. Past the 10 min mark, there was an increase in the IDR value for the CPROP salt, which was visualised using UV-imaging. The developed interfacial (surface) area ratio (Sdr) showed significant surface gains for the compacts. Full dosage form (capsule) imaging showed an improvement over the GEM for all the salts with an increase in chain length of the counterion bringing about a decrease in dissolution which correlated with the obtained UV-imaging IDR data.

AB Acriflavine (ACF) hydrochloride is currently repurposed as multimodal drug, inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) pathways and exerting cytotoxic properties. The aim of this study was to encapsulate ACF in reverse micelles and to incorporate this suspension in lipid nanocapsules (LNC). Designs of experiments were used to work under quality by design conditions. LNC were formulated using a phase-inversion temperature method, leading to an encapsulation efficiency around 80%. In vitro, the encapsulated drug presented similar cytotoxic activity and decrease in HIF activity in 4T1 cells compared to the free drug. In vivo, ACF-loaded nanoparticles (ACF dose of 5 mg/kg) demonstrated a higher antitumor efficacy compared to free ACF on an orthotopic model of murine breast cancer (4T1 cells). Moreover, the use of LNC allowed to drastically decrease the number of administrations compared to the free drug (2 versus 12 injections), suppressing the ACF-induced toxicity.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most lethal Brain tumors, characterized by its high invasive nature and increased mortality rates forms a major bottleneck in transport of therapeutics across the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are classified as enzymes, which are found to be up regulated in the Glioma tumor microenvironment and thus can be considered as a target for inhibition for curbing GBM. Many chemotherapeutics and techniques have been employed for inhibiting MMPs till now but all of them failed miserably and were withdrawn in clinical trials due to their inability in restricting the tumor growth or increasing the overall survival rates. Thus, the quest for finding the suitable MMP inhibitor is still on and there is a critical need for identification of novel compounds which can alter the BBB permeability, restrain tumor growth and prevent tumor recurrence. Currently, naturally derived substances are gaining widespread attention as tumor inhibitors and many studies have been reported by far highlighting their importance in restricting MMP expression thus serving as chemotherapeutics for cancer due to their minimal toxicity. These substances may serve as probable candidates for inhibiting MMP expression in GBM. However, targeting and delivering the inhibitor to its target site is an issue that needs to be overcome in order to attain maximum specificity and sustained release. The birth of nanotechnology served as a boon in delivering drugs to the most complicated areas thus paving way for Nano drug delivery. An efficient Nano carrier with ability to cross the BBB and competently kill the Glioma cells forms the prerequisite for GBM chemotherapy. Vesicular drug delivery systems are one such class of carriers, which have the capacity to release the drug at a predetermined rate at the target site thus minimizing any undesirable side effects. Exploiting vesicular systems as promising Nano drug carriers to formulate naturally derived substances, that can bypass the BBB and act as an inhibitor against MMPs in GBM is the main theme of this review.

AB Several studies have demonstrated dysregulated cardiac microRNAs (miRNAs) following cardiac stress and development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. miRNAs are also differentially expressed in the inflammation that occurs in heart failure and, among these inflammatory-related miRNAs, the miR-155 has been implicated in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. Despite these data showing the role of miRNA-155 in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy under a hypertrophic stimulus, it is also important to understand the endogenous regulation of this miRNA without a hypertrophic stimulus to fully appreciate its function in this cell type. The first aim of the present study was to determine whether, without a hypertrophic stimulus, miR-155 overexpression induces H9c2 cardiac cells hypertrophy in vitro. The second objective was to determine whether osteoglycin (Ogn), a key regulator of heart mass in rats, mice, and humans, is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-155 with a potential role in inducing H9c2 cells hypertrophy. Here, we show that, without a hypertrophic stimulus, miR-155 significantly repressed Ogn protein levels, but induce neither alteration in morphological phenotype nor in the expression of the molecular markers that fully characterize pathological hypertrophy of H9c2 cells. However, most importantly, Ogn silencing in H9c2 cells mimicked the effects of miR-155 overexpression in inducing cellular architecture changes that were characterized by a transition of the cell shape from fusiform to rounded. This is a new role of the post-transcriptional regulation of Ogn by miR-155 in the maintenance of the cardiac cell morphology in physiological and pathological conditions.

AB Background: Obesity triggers a variety of severe conditions, therefore deteriorates metabolism rate of adipose tissues and muscles. Uncoupling proteins which are highly stimulated by fatty acids are potential targets for antiobesity agents through breaking the electron gradient in the mitochondrial matrix and creating imbalances in the electron transport chain, thereby increasing the amount of substrate used to produce energy. Therefore, the aim of present study is assessment of exercise and high fat diet on expression level of Ucp1 subcutaneous white and brown adipose tissues (scWAT & BAT) respectively.
   Methods: To perform experiments, 48 male C57BL/6 mice were divided to two major groups and fed with high fat diet (HFD) or low fat diet (LFD) during a period of 12 weeks. After the first intervention, each groups was divided into four groups randomly as (HF-EX), (HF-SED), (LF-EX), (LF-SED) [EX: exercise; SED: sedentary] in form of treadmill running for 45 min/day, 5 days/week during 8 weeks. One day after the last practice session, mice were sacrificed and Ucp1 expression was assessed on scWAT & BAT.
   Results: Data indicated a down-regulation in scWAT Ucp1 in obese mice similar to what observed for the expression of Pgc1 alpha. Both, BAT Ucp1 and Pgc1 alpha mRNA decreased significantly in response to obesity and physical activity. Moreover, exercise caused significant decrease in scWAT mitochondrial proteins contradictory to BAT.
   Conclusion: Taken together, exercise exerted controversial effects compared with HFD and obesity on expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1 alpha in scWAT dissimilar to BAT tissues, concluding that obesity may cause a resistance to exercise in terms of metabolic demands for scWAT tissue.

AB Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and metastasis of HCC is the leading cause of poor prognosis. Among all the extrahepatic metastases, lymph node metastasis (LNM) is common, second only to lung metastasis. However, the pathogenesis of HCC LNM remains largely unknown.
   Methods: Microarray was performed to investigate the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles in serum samples from HCC LNM patients (N = 4) and HCC non-LNM controls (N = 5). Subsequently, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to validate the expression levels of randomly selected differential lncRNAs and mRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were employed to explore the potential functions of differentially expressed mRNAs. Co-expression networks were further constructed to elucidate the interactions of the differential genes and to speculate on the potential functions of the dominant lncRNAs. In this research, we attempted to illuminate the correlations between lncRNA and HCC LNM.
   Results: Compared with the non-LNM group, a total of 234 lncRNAs and 58 mRNAs were obtained as significantly dysregulated genes in LNM group (p < 0.05, fold change >= 2). Functional enrichment analyses showed that upregulated mRNAs are mostly enriched for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, biotin binding and AP-3 adaptor complex, while the downregulated mRNAs are enriched for macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor binding, succinate-CoA ligase activity and palmitoyltransferase activity. In addition, coexpression network revealed that the dominant lncRNAs are potential participants of protein metabolic process, integral component of membrane, RNA binding, Golgi apparatus, as well as focal adhesion pathway.
   Conclusion: This study first revealed the expression profiles and potential functions of dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs in HCC LNM, which may provide novel clues for further studies on HCC LNM.

AB Background: Leukoaraiosis (LA) is one of the manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption plays a key role in LA. Cadherin is a component of adherent junctions (AJ), which play a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion, cell-cell recognition and homeostasis in BBB development. We hypothesized that alterations in cadherin genes might be a potential cause of BBB abnormalities that result in LA.
   Methods: A total of 339 LA individuals (LA-PVWM, 183; LA-DWM 156) were enrolled, who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging with obtainable vascular risk factors. Genotyping of cadherin single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs5030625, rs1801026, and rs16260) was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction with LightSNiP reagents (coupled primer and probe) and FastStart DNAMaster HybProbe (Roche Diagnostic, GmBH, Mannheim, Germany) on a LightCycler 2.0 instrument.
   Results: Two SNPs, rs1801026 and rs16260, were significantly different between the control and LA groups. The combinatorial effects of the three SNPs were also significant. The haplotypes G-T-C and GA-T-A increased the development of LA-PVWM (OR = 1.76 and OR = 40.7, respectively). The haplotypes G-T-A and GA-T-A increased the development of LA-DWM (OR = 2.56 and OR = 10.48, respectively), but G-C-C decreased the development of LA-DWM (OR = 17.57).
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence for genetic polymorphisms of the AJ component cadherin gene and the association of its haplotypes with LA.

AB Objective: The study aimed to ascertain the correlation between AKR1B1 polymorphism rs759853 and the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) through a meta-analysis.
   Methods: Crude odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CIs) were calculated to assess the association of AKR1B1 rs759853 polymorphism with DR risk. Stratification analyses were further conducted based on ethnicity, diabetes mellitus (DM) type, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) status, and genotyping method. Heterogeneity was detected by Q test. Sensitivity analysis was implemented to check the robustness of final results. Additionally, Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test were used to evaluate underlying publication bias.
   Results: Our meta-analysis ultimately incorporated 21 eligible publications with 22 independent case-control studies. The overall results demonstrated that AKR1B1 rs759853 polymorphism had no association with DR risk under all genetic models. However, after subgroup analysis by DM type, the rs759853 polymorphism was a protective factor against the DR onset in patients with type 1 DM (TT vs. CC: OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.17-0.67; TT + CT vs. CC: OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.36-0.68; TT vs. CC + CT: OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.28-0.83; allele T vs. allele C: OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.44-0.72; CT vs. CC: OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.37-0.74). Furthermore, subgroup analysis by genotyping method suggested that rs759853 genotyped using MassARRAY assay was significantly correlated with decreased risk of DR under dominate model (TT + CT vs. CC: OR = 0.71, 95%CI = 0.52-0.96).
   Conclusion: AKR1B1 polymorphism rs759853 may inhibit the occurrence of DR in patients with type 1 DM.

AB Emerging evidence documented the key functions of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in various malignancies. Nevertheless, the research relevant to the clinical value and functions of circRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still very limited. In this study, we performed qRT-PCR to assess the levels of hsa_circ_0007534 in NSCLC tissues and cell lines and evaluated its clinical significance using Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis. Additionally, loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments were performed to detect whether hsa_circ_0007534 could affect cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastatic properties and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in A549 and H1299 cells. Further xenograft study was carried out to validate the in vitro data. The results indicated that hsa_circ_0007534 was up-regulated in both NSCLC tissue samples and cell lines and this up-regulation is linked to lymph node invasion and advanced TNM stage. Hsa_circ_0007534 could also function as an unfavorable prognostic indicator for the patients with NSCLC. For the part of functional assays, down-regulation of hsa_circ_0007534 suppressed cell growth, migratory and invasive capacities; facilitating cell apoptosis in A549 and H1299 cells. Conversely, up-regulation of hsa_circ_0007534 caused the opposite biological behaviors. What's more, animal experiments validated the oncogenic role of hsa_circ_0007534. Ultimately, the present study indicates that hsa_circ_0007534 might be a potential NSCLC-associated prognostic/therapeutic target.

AB The tripartite motif (TRIM)-5 and TRIM22 are involved in innate immune response and show anti-viral activities. The current study aimed at evaluating the association of TRIMS and TRIM22 polymorphisms with treatment outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC). TRIMS rs3824949 and TRIM22 polymorphisms (rs7113258, rs7935564, and rs1063303) were genotyped using TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in 425 treatment-naive CHC patients. Rapid virological response (RVR), early virological response (EVR), and sustained virological response (SVR) were found in 54.1%, 74.8%, and 67.1% of the patients, respectively. RVR and SVR were associated with TRIMS rs3824949 (GG), TRIM22 rs1063303 (GC), and TRIM22 rs7113258 (AA), while there was a relationship between TRIMS rs3824949 (GG) and EVR. TRIMS and TRIM22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were strongly associated with increased odds of RVR, EVR, and SVR after an interferon-based therapy in patients with CHC.

AB Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease with an estimated prevalence of 1/500. More than 40 genes have been reported to cause HCM. Among them, CSRP3 is usually included on HCM gene panels used for molecular diagnosis by next-generation sequencing (NGS). To provide new insights into the pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a NGS workflow based on a panel of 48 cardiomyopathies-causing genes was analyzed on a cohort of 542 HCM patients. As expected, this molecular approach led to identify most pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants into prevalent HCM-causing genes: MYBPC3 (123/542; 22.7%), MYH7 (48/542; 8.9%), TNNT2 (12/542; 2.2%), and TNNI3 (10/542; 1.8%). Among MYBPC3 variants, 96 led to a premature stop codon (78%). More surprisingly, our molecular study led also to detect, for the first time, homozygous CSRP3 truncating variants in two unrelated HCM probands. Meta-analysis of rare previously reported CSRP3 variants on HCM probands using ACMG guidelines indicate that only one variation (p.Cys58Gly) could be considered as likely pathogen. By combining meta-analysis results and identification of two unrelated HCM patients with homozygous CSRP3 truncating variants, we suggest that the association of CSRP3 as a validated HCM-causing gene require additional studies and those CSRP3 variants could result in HCM with an autosomal recessive inheritance rather than with an autosomal dominant transmission as usually reported on HCM (OMIM 612124).

AB Glioma is a devastating disease with increasing incidence worldwide. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) was demonstrated to be involved in a wide range of pathophysiological processes, including tumorigenesis and development. Recently, the abnormally expressed hsa_circ_0001649 was found in several malignancies. In the current study, the expression levels of hsa_circ_0001649 in glioma and its clinical significance were explored. The biological functions including cell growth, colony-forming ability and apoptosis altered by hsa_circ_0001649 were further investigated in vitro. Tumor formation assay was also carried out to elucidate the oncogenic properties of hsa_circ_0001649. The data documented a decrease of hsacirc_0001649 expression in glioma specimens and cell lines. In addition, down-regulated hsa_circ_0001649 is linked to larger tumor size (p = 0.002) and advanced WHO grade (p = 0.023). Additionally, hsacirc_0001649 may be an independent prognostic marker for glioma patients after surgery (p = 0.046). Moreover, up-regulated hsa_circ_0001649 inhibits glioma cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, increased expression of hsa_circ_0001649 facilitates apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2/caspase-3 pathway. Ultimately, this study suggests that hsa_circ_0001649 may be a potential glioma-related prognostic/therapeutic target.

AB Purpose: To determine SLCOIBI rs4149056 and rs2306283 gene polymorphisms and SLCO1B1 serum levels in patients with early and exudative age-related macular degeneration.
   Materials and methods: The study enrolled 206 patients with exudative AMD, 253 patients with early AMD and 301 control subjects. DNA was extracted from peripheral venous blood leukocytes using commercial kits. Genotyping of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 and rs2306283 was carried out using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Serum SLCO1B1 levels were measured using SLCO1B1 ELISA kit.
   Results: We found statistically significant differences in genotype (T/T, T/C and C/C) distribution of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 variant between the patients with exudative AMD and control group (52.4%, 47.6% and 0% vs. 64.8%, 31.6% and 13.7%, respectively, p < 0.001). Univariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that age was a risk factor for exudative AMD development. Also, T/C variant was associated with 1.9-fold increased Odds ratio of exudative AMD development under a codominant model (OR = 1.863; 95% CI: 1.290;2.689; p < 0.001). The results remained of the same statistical significance after multivariate analysis. On the other hand, C allele was associated with 1.6-fold increased odds ratio of exudative AMD development (OR = 1.563; 95% CI: 1.035;2.359; p = 0.034) only after adjustment for age. No significant associations were found in analysis of genotypes and alleles at rs2306283.
   Serum SLCO1B1 concentration was significantly higher in early AMD patients than in healthy controls (median, IQR: 2.92 ng/ml, 5.01 ng/ml versus 1.26 ng/ml, 2.63 ng/ml, respectively, p = 0.025), as well as in exudative AMD patients than in controls (median, IQR: 2.72 ng/ml, 5.71 ng/ml versus 1.26 ng/ml, 2.63 ng/ml, respectively, p = 0.002). Furthermore, subjects with rs4149056 T/C genotype had higher SLCO1B1 serum levels than those with T/T genotype (median, IQR: 3.73 ng/ml, 3.14 ng/ml versus 1.23 ng/ml, 1.47 ng/ml, respectively, p = 0.037).
   Conclusion: Our study determined that SLCO1B1 (c.521 T > C) rs4149056 T/C genotype and C allele may be associated with exudative age-related macular degeneration, as well as with elevated serum SLCO1B1 levels. Also, higher serum SLCO1B1 levels were found to be associated with early and exudative age-related macular degeneration.

AB Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA is a central mode of genetic regulation in higher eukaryotes. High-throughput experimental verification of alternative splice forms, functional characterization, and regulation of alternative splicing are key directions for research. However, little information is available on the transcriptome-wide changes during different ages in different chicken breeds. In this study, the sequencing reads of chicken muscle tissues collected from White feather broiler (day 42) and Luning Chicken (day 70, 120, 150) were mapped to the chicken genome. Results showed that a total of 16,958 genes were annotated, with 2230 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when comparing White feather broiler and Luning Chicken, and an average of 700 DEGs when comparing different ages in Liming Chicken. Functional classification by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathways analysis for selecting the genes showed most DEGs were related to muscle development and immune response. Of the 16,958 genes, a total of 6249 genes (36.85%) underwent AS events, and over 40% were specifically expressed in each library. Additionally, 6 DEGs (SRPK3, ENSGALG00000022884, CCL4, GATM, SESN1,PTTG1IP) involved in muscle development and immunity response were found to be alternatively spliced among all the four muscle tissues. In conclusion, we present a complete dataset involving the spatial and temporal transcriptome of chicken muscle tissue using RNA -seq. These data will facilitate the understanding of the effects of breed and age on the development of muscle and uncover that AS events of candidate genes may have important functional roles in regulation of muscle development in chicken.

TI Hypermethylated LATS2 gene with decreased expression in female breast
   cancer: A case control study from North India

ID ENCODES; KINASE
AB Background: LATS2, a presumed tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 13q11-12 is involved in cell growth related activity like regulation of cell cycle at G1/S. The reduced expression of LATS2 has been reported in many tumors; including tumors of Breast, which is to the best of our knowledge has not been studied in north Indian female breast cancer population.
   Objective: Here, we looked upon the expression pattern and methylation status of the LATS2 gene in north Indian female breast cancer cases to further strengthen its role as a tumor suppressor gene and more importantly as a cancer biomarker.
   Methods: mRNA expression level was determined by real time PCR in 140 Breast cancer patients, Protein expression was studied by Immunohistochemistry and Promoter methylation was studied by Methylation specific PCR. All findings were correlated with clinicopathological features.
   Results: LATS2 mRNA expression was remarkably downregulated in 67.85% (95/140) cases. The expression of Large Associated Tumor Suppressor 2 at protein level was also absent in 67.85% (95/140) cases. The absence of LATS2 protein strongly correlated with promoter hypermethylation where 91 out of a total of 107 hyper methylated cases showed absence of protein (91/107, 85%). The absence of LATS2 protein was strongly significant with HER2 neu status (0.01), TNM staging (0.009) and Molecular subtype (0.024).
   Conclusion: The decreased expression in breast cancer seems to be associated with hypermethylation of LATS2 promoter regions. Further LATS2 as a tumor suppressor can be recognized as a promising Biomarker in Breast cancer pathogenesis. Though, further studies, targeting larger sets of breast cancer population are required to establish LATS2 as a promising biomarker.

AB We performed the in silico genome-wide identification of antimicrobial peptides against the available genome sequence of the naked mole rat Heterocephalus glaber (H. glaber). Our results showed the presence of Hg-CATH, the single cathelicidin containing the antimicrobial domain in H. glaber. We chemically synthesized a 25 amino-acid peptide (Delta Hg-CATH) corresponding to the predicted antimicrobial-active core region of Hg-CATH, and evaluated its antibacterial activity against seven bacterial strains. The Delta Hg-CATH peptide exhibited strong bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria, including a multi-drug resistant strain, while showing low toxicity towards mammalian cells, including erythrocytes. Scanning electron microscopy images of bacterial cells treated with Delta Hg-CATH showed disruption of their membranes due to the formation of toroidal pores. Identifying novel antimicrobial peptides, such as Hg-CATH, may be important for identifying candidate peptides for the control of multi-drug resistant bacteria.

AB One of the most importantly involved pathways in cancer development is fatty-acid signaling pathway. Synthesized lipids as energetic sources are consumed by cancer cells for proliferation, growth, survival, invasion and angiogenesis. Fatty acids as signaling compounds regulate metabolic and transcriptional networks, survival pathways and inflammatory responses. Aggregation of fatty acids with fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) facilitates their transportation to different cell organelles. FABPs, a group of lipid binding proteins modulate fatty acid metabolism, cell growth and proliferation and cancer development. They may be used as tumor marker in some cancers. FABPs are expressed in most malignancies such as prostate, breast, liver, bladder and lung cancer which are associated with the incidence, proliferation, metastasis, invasion of tumors. This review introduces several isoforms of FABPs (FABP1-12) and summarizes their function and their possible roles in cancer development through some proposed mechanisms.

ID GENE-TRANSFER; HUMAN-CELLS; SYSTEM; SELECTION
AB Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon based technology has been extensively applied in basic research and biotechnology for routine cell culture gene delivery and vertebrate transgenesis, and it is also investigated in various gene therapy applications. Cell tolerance for the transgene is a key factor during transgenesis and is modulated not only through the type but by the dose of expression. Our experimental results exemplify that transgenes regulated with high activity promoters can reduce the overall success of gene delivery. Observations connected to transposon donors regulated by different promoters have also revealed inverse correlation between transcription activity and the hyperactive variant SB100X excision efficiency. This competition between transcription and transposition was independent of the transgene coding sequence and did not alter the transgenic efficiency in general. However, promoters applied in the transgene cassette can produce different average copy numbers depending on the transcriptional activity of the transposon. Unlike the piggyBac (PB) transposon system, this phenomenon allows a fine balance of expression using the high copy potential SB system that adjusts the copy number of lower activity promoter driven transgenes to a higher expression level. All this contributes to a well-tolerated and satisfactory transgenesis, and would be important to consider in gene therapy applications.

AB Objective: To study the correlation between adenosine deaminase (ADA) and IFN-gamma gene polymorphism and the risk of tuberculous pericarditis (TBP).
   Methods: Two-hundred and forty-five patients with TBP were enrolled as a study group, including 140 males and 105 females. According to the general information of TBP patients in the study group, 115 patients with non-tuberculous pericarditis were recruited as the control group. Four ADA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs121908715, rs79281338, rs121908723, and rs61737144) and the rs2069707 locus of the IFN-gamma polymorphism were detected using PCR and Sanger sequencing.
   Results: Carriers with the T allele at the rs121908715 locus of ADA had a higher risk of TBP (adjusted OR = 3.986, 95% CI = 1.858-8.718, p < 0.001). There was a significantly higher risk of TBP in carriers with the G allele at the rs121908723 locus of ADA (adjusted OR = 2.334, 95% CI = 1.084-5.102, p = 0.018). The risk of TBP was higher in carriers with the G allele at the rs2069707 locus of IFN-gamma (adjusted OR = 2.844, 95% CI = 1.399-5.853,p = 0.002). TB patients who carry both the T allele at the rs121908715 locus of ADA and the G allele of the IFN-gamma gene, or who both carry the G allele at the rs126908723 locus of ADA and the G allele at the rs2069707 locus of IFN-gamma have a higher risk of contracting TBP (adjusted OR = 11.034, 95% CI = 2.781-15.328, p < 0.001 and adjusted OR = 10.315, 95% CI = 4.522-13.854, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The ADA SNPs rs12190871 and rs121908723, and the rs2069707 locus SNPs of IFN-gamma are risk factors for contracting TBP.

AB The genus Fusarium contains some of the most studied and important species of plant pathogens that economically affect world agriculture and horticulture. Fusarium spp. are ubiquitous fungi widely distributed in soil, plants as well as in different organic substrates and are also considered as opportunistic human pathogens. The identification of specific enzymes essential to the metabolism of these fungi is expected to provide molecular targets to control the diseases they induce to their hosts. Through applications of traditional techniques of sequence homology comparison by similarity search and Markov modeling, this report describes the characterization of enzymatic functionalities associated to protein targets that could be considered for the control of root rots induced by Fusarium oxysporum. From the analysis of 318 F. graminearum enzymes, we retrieved 30 enzymes that are specific of F. oxysporum compared to 15 species of host plants. By comparing these 30 specific enzymes of F. oxysporum with the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica rapa, Glycine max, Jatropha curcas and Ricinus communis, we found 7 key specific enzymes whose inhibition is expected to affect significantly the development of the fungus and 5 specific enzymes that were considered here to be secondary because they are inserted in pathways with alternative routes.

AB ATP-binding cassette (ABC) is one of the largest superfamily of proteins, which are ubiquitously present, performing variety of cellular functions. These proteins as drug transporters have been enticing substantial consideration because of their clinical importance. The present study focuses on genome wide identification of ABC proteins of an important halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii and explores their role in salt and drug tolerance. Our bioinformatics analysis identified a total of 30 putative ABC protein-coding genes whose expression at transcript level was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Our comparative phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide binding domains of D. hansenii and topology prediction categorized these proteins into six subfamilies; ABCB/MDR, ABCC/MRP, ABCD/ALDP, ABCF/YEF3, ABCE/RLI, and ABCG/PDR based on the nomenclature adopted by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO). Further, our transmembrane domain (TMD) predictions suggest that out of 30 ABC proteins, only 22 proteins possess either two or one TMD and hence are considered as membrane localized ABC proteins. Notably, our transcriptional dynamics of ABC proteins encoding genes following D. hansenii cells treatment with different salts and drugs concentrations illustrated variable transcriptional response of some of the genes, pointing to their role in salt and drug tolerance. This study first time provides a comprehensive inventory of the ABC proteins of a haploid D. hansenii which will be helpful for exploring their functional relevance.

AB Deer antlers, the secondary organs of deer, are a unique model to study regeneration of organ/tissue in mammals. Pedicle periosteum (PP) is the key tissue type for antler regeneration. Based on our previous study, the DNA methylation was found to be the basic molecular mechanism underlying the antler regeneration. In this study, we compare the genome-wide DNA methylation level in regenerative tissues (the potentiated PP of antler, muscle, heart and liver) and non-regenerative tissue (the dormant PP) of deer by the fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP) method. Our results showed that DNA methylation level was significantly lower in the regenerative tissues compared to the non-regenerative tissue (P < 0.05). Furthermore, 26 T-DMRs which displayed different methylated status in regenerative and non-regenerative tissues were identified by the MSAP method, and were further confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Taken together, our data suggest that DNA methylation, an important epigenetic regulation mechanism, may play an important role in the mammalian tissue/organ regeneration.

ID DIFFERENTIATION
AB The impact of exercises on young developing organisms is still of interest to researchers. Similarly like Thoroughbreds, Arabian horses competing at the race track. The high percent of lameness and loss of days in training are often the result of weakness in the condition of the musculoskeletal system. The objective of the presented study was to identify by RNA-Seq method, the possible skeletal system originating transcriptomic profile in peripheral blood of Arabian horses undergoing race training. Obtained results showed that one of the most significantly deregulated pathway involved in bone homeostasis was those involved in osteoclast differ. entiation. Among the significantly expressed molecules, we recognized twelve genes potentially involved in the metabolism of the skeletal system: BGLAP, CTSK, TYROBP, PDLIM7, SLC9B2, TWSG1, NOTCH2, IL6ST, VAV3, NFATc1, CLEC5A, TXLNG. The panel of identified genes should be evaluated as candidate biomarkers for bone homeostasis indicators of Arabians performing on race tracks to assess bone remodelling states during training for race track competitions.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate eukaryotic gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In addition to their involvement in a variety of biological processes, miRNAs are implicated in the eukaryotic response to bacterial pathogens. The objective of this study was to identify miRNAs involved in the regulation of the porcine response to the human foodborne pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). Differential expression analysis from the whole blood of pigs over a 7-day period following S. Typhimurium challenge identified 50 miRNAs, many of which are implicated in functional pathways associated with NF-kappa B signaling and apoptosis (e.g., ssc-let-7c, ssc-miR-21). Transcriptional analyses of whole blood mRNA identified the differential expression of several genes involved in NF-kappa B signaling and apoptosis (e.g., IL10, CBX4, TGFB2) whose mRNAs are predicted targets of miRNAs identified in our study. Overall, our data identified porcine miRNAs that are differentially expressed following S. Typhimurium challenge, thereby defining regulatory factors to target for controlling the porcine response to this human foodborne pathogen.

AB Rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus is the first marine teleost demonstrated to have the ability to synthesize long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from C-18 PUFA precursors, and thus provides us a unique model for studying the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in teleosts. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were shown to play important roles in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish at posttranscriptional level in our previous studies. Here, we focused the roles of miR-146a in such regulation. The expression of miR-146a displayed an inverse pattern with that of elongase 5 (Elovl5), a key enzyme catalyzing the elongation of C-18 (18:4n3 and 18:3n6) and C-20 (20:5n3 and 20:4n6) PUFA in the LC-PUFA biosynthesis, in vivo in liver of rabbitfish reared under different salinities, as well as in vitro in S. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells incubated with different fatty acids. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-146a may target the 3'UTR of elovl5 directly, which was confirmed by the dual luciferase reporter assays in HEK 293T cells. Overexpression of miR-146a significantly downregulated the expression of elovl5 in SCHL cells, while knockdown of miR-146a showed an opposite effect. Moreover, up-regulation of miR-146a in SCHL cells significantly suppressed the elongation indexes 20:3n6/18:3n6, 20:4n3/18:4n3 and 22:5n3/20:5n3 associated with Elovl5 catalyzing activity, and consequently reduced the contents of LC-PUFA. These results indicate that miR-146a is involved in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis through inhibiting the mRNA expression and activity of Elovl5 in rabbitfish, which was for the first time to focus on the role of miR-146a in LC-PUFA biosynthesis in vertebrates and will provide a new insight into the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in teleosts.

AB The increasing vital roles of long coding RNA (lncRNAs) in the glioma tumorigenesis have renewedly and roundly recognized. Nevertheless, the in-depth that lncRNAs modulate the gliomagenesis is still elusive. In this research, we focus on the functional study of lncRNA SNHG12 in the glioma pathogenesis. SNHG12 expression was enhanced and high-expressed in the glioma clinical tissue samples and cell lines, especially in the advanced clinical grade. In functional study, knockdown of SNHG12 impaired the proliferation, induced the apoptosis in vitro and, meanwhile, inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. In mechanistic study, it was found that SNHG12 harbored the complementary binding sites with miR-101-3p at 3'-UTR, acting as a miRNA 'sponge'. Furthermore, miR-101-3p also targeted the 3'-UTR of FOXP1 mRNA. The three elements construct the SNHG12/miR-101-3p/FOXP1 axis. Overall, we confirmed a functional regulatory pathway that SNHG12 and miR-101-3p regulated the expression of FOXP1 in glioma cells, forming the SNHG12/miR-101-3p/FOXP1 pathway. This finding might act as a valuable target for glioma.

AB Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been emerged as critical regulators for human diseases and as prognostic markers in several tumors, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Herein, we identified a tumor-suppressive miRNA, miR-202-5p, which may suppress CRC tumorigenesis. SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily c member 1 (SMARCC1) is a susceptibility gene in CRC. However, the role of SMARCC1 in CRC tumorigenesis has not been elucidated. In our present study, we demonstrated that miR-202-5p was a tumor-suppressive miRNA in CRC progression. We found that expression of miR-202-5p was obviously decreased in CRC tissues. Down-regulation of miR-202-5p was associated with postoperative survival. Overexpression of miR-202-5p inhibited the growth and metastasis of CRC cells. The SMARCC1 was a direct target of miR-202-5p and promoted the growth and metastasis of CRC cells. Further study showed that SMARCC1 could reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-202-5p on growth and metastasis of CRC cells. In conclusion, our data highlight the key role of miR-202-5p in the progression of CRC. Thus, miR-202-5p may be a potential prognostic marker and of treatment relevance for CRC progression intervention.

   Stability analysis; Jacobian
AB In this paper, the Jacobian matrix of the Coarse-Mesh Finite Difference (CMFD) method is analyzed. Both the homogenization and the current preservation effects are studied in heterogeneous multidimensional configurations. Some bounding values of the spectral radius are also given. An analytical stability analysis is carried on an interface slab problem. This analysis leads to the computation of the stability parameter introduced in the Generalized Coarse Mesh Rebalancing method. A dynamical stabilization technique is proposed for multidimensional neutron lattice calculations. Numerical calculations show that the proposed technique dumps the unstable modes, in particular in optically thick configurations, where the classical CMFD method fails to converge.

AB This paper deals with anisotropic mesh adaptation applied to unsteady inviscid CFD simulations. Anisotropic metric-based mesh adaptation is an efficient strategy to reduce the extensive CPU time currently required by time-dependent simulations in an industrial context. In this work, we detail the time-accurate extension of multi-scale anisotropic mesh adaptation for steady flows [35] (a control of the interpolation error in L(P )norm to capture all the scales of the solution contrary to the L-infinity norm that only focuses on the larger scales) to unsteady flows when time advancing discretizations are considered. This is based on a space-time error analysis and an enhanced version of the fixed-point algorithm [3]. We also show that each stage - remeshing, metric field computation, solution transfer, and flow solution - is important to design an efficient time-accurate anisotropic mesh adaptation process. The parallelization of the whole mesh adaptation platform is also discussed. The efficiency of the approach is emphasized on three-dimensional problems with convergence rate and CPU time analysis.

AB A new parallel generalized unstructured grid solver for prediction of rarefied gas dynamics is presented. The method is based on the direct numerical solution of the semi-classical Boltzmann equation using a discrete velocity method (DVM) and supports accurate prediction of non-continuum flows in near-vacuum rarefied flow regimes. For in-space propulsion applications which involve mixed continuum-rarefied environments, the flow regimes are solved separately through the use of DVM and hybrid RANS/LES solution procedures, respectively, on the same computational domain while interacting with one another. The solver also supports coupled Lagrangian particle transport and coalescence/breakup modeling to enable prediction of plume flow impingement and contaminant dispersal through mixed continuum-rarefied environments around spacecraft. Such simulation capabilities are essential for the prediction of spacecraft environments concerning plume impingement pressure, heating, and contamination on spacecraft components such as solar panels and sensitive instruments. Example applications include venting and plume flow environments from spacecraft main engines and attitude control thrusters firing in near-vacuum conditions. The framework upon which the solvers are developed is introduced along with a detailed description of the direct Boltzmann solution and collision integral evaluation procedures. The accuracy of standalone kinetic and coupled continuum-kinetic predictions is validated by comparison against experimental data for shock structure using various different intermolecular interaction models. Results are presented to demonstrate the merits of the capability for prediction of high-speed gas-particle interaction through complex moving shock systems, and thruster plume flow impingement with liquid droplet tracking in near-vacuum conditions.

AB A phase-space boundary integral method is developed for modelling stochastic high-frequency acoustic and vibrational energy transport in both single and multi-domain problems. The numerical implementation is carried out using the collocation method in both the position and momentum phase-space variables. One of the major developments of this work is the systematic convergence study, which demonstrates that the proposed numerical schemes exhibit convergence rates that could be expected from theoretical estimates under the right conditions. For the discretisation with respect to the momentum variable, we employ spectrally convergent basis approximations using both Legendre polynomials and Gaussian radial basis functions. The former have the advantage of being simpler to apply in general without the need for preconditioning techniques. The Gaussian basis is introduced with the aim of achieving more efficient computations in the weak noise case with near-deterministic dynamics. Numerical results for a series of coupled domain problems are presented, and demonstrate the potential for future applications to larger scale problems from industry. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB This paper develops a finite element formulation and computational model for coupling electric and finite strain dynamic fields with widely discrepant frequencies, governing the behavior of piezoelectric materials. The piezoelectric materials are defined by time-dependent nonlinear constitutive laws. A fully coupled, total Lagrangian finite element formulation is developed for modeling the electric and mechanical fields. A challenge in computational modeling of piezoelectric devices arise due to large discrepancy in the frequencies of the electrical signal and mechanical vibrations, especially when a large number of mechanical cycles need to be simulated. A wavelet transformation induced multi-time scaling (WATMUS) algorithm is developed for dynamic piezoelectric simulations. The WATMUS algorithm projects the high frequency electric fields on to the lower frequency of displacement and velocity fields, on which time integration is performed. The method significantly enhances the computational efficiency in comparison with single time scale integration methods. The accuracy and efficiency of the WATMUS algorithm are validated through piezo-electric applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We describe an energy-enstrophy conserving discretisation for the rotating shallow water equations with slip boundary conditions. This relaxes the assumption of boundary-free domains (periodic solutions or the surface of a sphere, for example) in the energy-enstrophy conserving formulation of McRae and Cotter (2014). This discretisation requires extra prognostic vorticity variables on the boundary in addition to the prognostic velocity and layer depth variables. The energy-enstrophy conservation properties hold for any appropriate set of compatible finite element spaces defined on arbitrary meshes with arbitrary boundaries. We demonstrate the conservation properties of the scheme with numerical solutions on a rotating hemisphere. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We introduce a provably stable, high-order-accurate finite difference method for simulation of acoustic and flexural gravity waves in compressible, inviscid fluids partially covered by a thin elastic layer. Such waves arise when studying ocean wave interactions with floating ice shelves, sea ice, and floating structures. Particular emphasis is on a well-posed interface treatment of the fluid-ice coupling. To ensure numerical stability and efficiency, finite difference approximations based on the summation-by-parts (SBP) framework are combined with a penalty technique (simultaneous approximation term, SAT) to impose the boundary and interface conditions. The resulting SBP-SAT approximations are time integrated with an unconditionally stable finite difference method. Numerical simulations in 2D corroborate the predicted efficiency and stability behaviors. The method can be used in its current form to study transmission of ocean waves and tsunamis through ice shelves, and upon coupling to an elastic half-space beneath the ice and water, to study ice motions associated with long-period seismic surface waves.

AB We present new Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (DG) hydrodynamic methods for compressible flows on unstructured meshes in axisymmetric coordinates. The physical evolution equations for the specific volume, velocity, and specific total energy are discretized using a modal DG method with linear Taylor series polynomials. Two different approaches are used to discretize the evolution equations - the first one is the true volume approach and the second one is the area-weighted approach. For the true volume approach, the DG equations are derived using the true 3D volume that is consistent with the geometry conservation law (GCL). The Riemann velocity at the nodes on the surface of the element, and the corresponding surface forces, are calculated by solving a multidirectional approximate Riemann problem using surfaces areas for axisymmetric coordinates. This true volume approach conserves mass, momentum, and total energy and satisfies the GCL. However, it can not preserve spherical symmetry on an equal-angle polar grid with 1D radial flows. For the area-weighted approach, the DG equations are based on the 2D Cartesian geometry that is rotated about the axis of symmetry using a single, element average radius. With this approach, the Riemann velocity at the nodes on the surface of the element, and the corresponding surface forces, are calculated by solving a multidirectional approximate Riemann problem in 2D Cartesian geometry. This area-weighted approach, in the limit of an infinitesimal mesh size, conserves physical momentum, and physical total energy. The area-weighted approach preserves spherical symmetry on an equal-angle polar grid for 1D radial flows, but it does not satisfy the GCL. A suite of test problems are calculated to demonstrate stable mesh motion, the expected second order accuracy of these methods, and that the new area-weighted DG method preserves spherical symmetry on 1D radial flow problems with equal-angle polar meshes.

AB In this paper, we propose a simple and accurate numerical method for capturing moving interfaces on fixed Eulerian grids by coupling the Tangent of Hyperbola Interface Capturing (THINC) method and Level Set (LS) method. The innovative and practically-significant aspects of the proposed method, so-called THINC/LS method, lie in (1) representing the interface with polynomial of high-order (arbitrary order in principle) rather than the plane representation commonly used in the Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC) Volume of fluid (VOF) methods, (2) conserving rigorously the mass of the transported VOF field, (3) being able to resolving fine interface structures under mesh resolution, and (4) providing a straightforward and easy-to-code algorithm for 3D implementation. We verified the proposed scheme with the widely used benchmark tests. Numerical results show that this new method can obtain high-order accuracy for interface reconstruction and can produce more accurate results in capturing moving interfaces compared to the classical VOF methods.

AB This paper aims at studying the influence of material heterogeneity on the stability of explicit time marching schemes for the high-order spectral element discretisation of wave propagation problems. A periodic fluctuation of the density and stiffness parameters is considered, where the period is related to the characteristic element size of the mesh. A new stability criterion is derived analytically for quadratic and cubic one-dimensional spectral elements in heterogeneous materials by using a standard Von Neumann analysis. The analysis presented illustrates the effect of material heterogeneity on the stability limit and also reveals the origin of instabilities that are often observed when the stability limit derived for homogeneous materials is adapted by simply changing the velocity of the wave to account for the material heterogeneity. Several extensions of the results derived for quadratic and cubic one-dimensional spectral elements are discussed, including higher order approximations, different periodicity of the material parameters and higher dimensions. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the validity of the new stability limits derived for heterogeneous materials with periodic fluctuation. Finally numerical examples of the stability for randomly fluctuating material properties are also presented, discussing the applicability of the theoretical limits derived for material properties with periodic fluctuation.

AB We present an algebraic dynamic multilevel method for multiphase flow in heterogeneous fractured porous media (F-ADM), where fractures are resolved at fine scale with an embedded discrete modelling approach. This fine-scale discrete system employs independent fine-scale computational grids for heterogeneous matrix and discrete fractures, which results in linear system sizes out of the scope of the classical simulation approaches. To reduce the computational costs, yet provide accurate solutions, on this highly resolved fine-scale mesh, F-ADM imposes independent dynamic multilevel coarse grids for both matrix and lower-dimensional discrete fractures. The fully-implicit discrete system is then mapped into this adaptive dynamic multilevel resolution for all unknowns (i.e., pressure and phase saturation). The dynamic resolution aims for resolving sharp fronts for the transport unknowns, thus constant interpolators are used to map the saturation from coarse to fine grids both in matrix and fractures. However, due to the global nature of the pressure unknowns, local multilevel basis functions for both matrix and fractures with flexible matrix-fracture coupling treatment are introduced for the pressure. The assembly of the full sets of basis functions allows for mapping the solutions up and down between any resolutions. Due to its adaptive multilevel resolution, F-ADM develops an automatic integrated framework to homogenise or explicitly represent a fracture network at a coarser level by selection of the multilevel coarse nodes in each sub-domain. Various test cases, including multiphase flow in 2D and 3D media, are studied, where only a fraction of the fine-scale grids is employed to obtain accurate nonlinear multiphase solutions. FADM casts a promising approach for large-scale simulation of multiphase flow in fractured media. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An invariant-region-preserving (IRP) limiter for multi-dimensional hyperbolic conservation law systems is introduced, as long as the system admits a global invariant region which is a convex set in the phase space. It is shown that the order of approximation accuracy is not destroyed by the IRP limiter, provided the cell average is away from the boundary of the convex set. Moreover, this limiter is explicit, and easy for computer implementation. A generic algorithm incorporating the IRP limiter is presented for high order finite volume type schemes. For arbitrarily high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes to hyperbolic conservation law systems, sufficient conditions are obtained for cell averages to remain in the invariant region provided the projected one-dimensional system shares the same invariant region as the full multi-dimensional hyperbolic system does. The general results are then applied to both one and two dimensional compressible Euler equations so to obtain high order IRP DG schemes. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the proven properties of the IRP limiter and the performance of IRP DG schemes for compressible Euler equations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A weighted and shifted difference formula is constructed based on the Lubich operators, which gives a forth-order and unconditionally stable difference scheme for the Cauchy problem of space fractional diffusion equations. The novelty of the proposed method here is that only four weighted parameters are required, compared to eight parameters used in the previous work, to achieve the fourth-order accuracy and to ensure the stability at the same time. To verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme, several numerical experiments for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional fractional diffusion problems are provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The paper discusses high-order finite-volume numerical modeling of drift waves, which is an ubiquitous phenomenon in magnetized plasmas. It is found that some standard discretization methods applied to the conservative form of the governing equations can lead to a numerical instability. A method to stabilize high-order discretization is proposed and demonstrated to work in numerical simulations performed with the fourth-order finite-volume code COGENT. As practical examples, a stable drift-wave solution with adiabatic electrons and the collisionless (universal) drift-wave instability driven by electron kinetic effects are considered. Application of the present analysis to a broader range of computational fluid dynamics systems is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a novel partitioned algorithm for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems that couples the motion of rigid bodies and incompressible flow. This is the first partitioned algorithm that remains stable and second-order accurate, without sub-time-step iterations, for very light, and even zero-mass, bodies in three dimensions. This new added-mass partitioned (AMP) algorithm extends the previous developments in [1, 2] by generalizing the added-damping tensors to account for arbitrary three-dimensional rotations, and by employing a general quadrature for the surface integral over a rigid body to derive the discrete AMP interface condition for the fluid pressure. Stability analyses for two three-dimensional model problems show that the algorithm remains stable for bodies of any mass when applied to the relevant model problems. The resulting AMP algorithm is implemented in parallel using a moving composite grid framework to treat one or more rigid bodies in complex three-dimensional configurations. The new three-dimensional algorithm is verified and validated though several benchmark problems, including the motion of a sphere in a viscous incompressible fluid and the interaction of a bi-leaflet mechanical heart valve and a pulsating fluid. Numerical simulations confirm the predictions of the stability analysis even for complex problems, and show that the AMP algorithm remains stable, without sub-iterations, for light and even zero-mass three-dimensional rigid bodies of general shape. These benchmark problems are further used to examine the parallel performance of the algorithm and to investigate the conditioning of the linear system for the pressure including the newly derived AMP interface conditions.

AB A new computational model is developed to solve three phase immiscible compressible flow in strongly heterogeneous poroelastic media. Within the context of the iterative coupled formulation based on the fixed stress split algorithm the governing equations are decomposed into three subsystems associated with the geomechanics, hydrodynamics and transport problems. The hydrodynamics involves an overall compressibility which plays essential role in the magnitude of additional source in the pressure equation associated the time derivative of the total mean stress. We show that the additional coefficients in the source can be decomposed into a rock/grain and fluid components involving the formation volume factors of each phase. The flow equations are written in a proper conservative form for application of mixed-hybrid formulation whereas the nonlinear coupling between flow and transport is handled by a proper sequential iterative scheme. A new post-processing approach is proposed to update the Lagrangian porosity based on the freezing of the total mean stress which reproduces the one-way formulation in a straightforward fashion under the stationarity of the total mean stress. The geomechanical subsystem is also discretized by a mixed formulation based on the decomposition of the effective stress into spherical and deviatoric components in order to handle the nearly-incompressible undrained limit. The system of conservation laws for the liquid saturations is rephrased in an alternative form for an appropriate operator splitting method, leading to the appearance of an extra source term arising from the transient behavior of the Lagrangian porosity induced by the geomechanical coupling. Within the framework of a predictor-corrector scheme, the predictor step is discretized by an extended version of a higher order central-upwind scheme whereas the corrector, which captures the influence of rock skeleton deformation upon transport, is captured by a Godunov splitting. The potential of the new computational model is illustrated in numerical simulations of water-flooding and of WAG (Water Alternating Gas) injection problems in poroelastic media. Numerical results illustrate precisely the role of the transient nature of the total stress upon subsidence, rock compaction, oil and gas production and finger grow in primary and secondary recovery regimes.

Plasma is assumed isotropic in momentum space. The set of reactions consists of: Moeller and Bhabha scattering, Compton scattering, two-photon pair annihilation, and two-photon pair production, which are described by QED matrix elements. In our method exact energy and particle number conservation laws are fulfilled. Reaction rates are compared, where possible, with the corresponding analytical expressions and convergence of numerical rates is demonstrated. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a reduced-order approximation of the BGK equation leading to fast and accurate computations. The BGK model describes the dynamics of a gas flow in both hydrodynamic and rarefied regimes. The particles of the gas are represented by a density distribution function depending on physical space, velocity space and time. In this work, the density distribution function is approximated in the velocity space by a small number of basis functions computed offline. In the offline phase, the BGK equation is sampled in order to collect information on the density distribution function. To complete this sampling, optimal transport is used to add new information by interpolating the samples of the density distribution function. Finally, the basis functions are built by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. During the online phase, the offline knowledge is used to compute approximations of the density distribution function at low cost. To do so, the BGK equation is projected onto the basis functions, leading to a system of partial differential equations. The system obtained is hyperbolic by construction and is solved by an IMEX Runge-Kutta scheme in time and a finite-volume scheme in space. To improve the accuracy, the reduced-oder model is modified to conserve mass, momentum and energy of the gas. Numerical illustrations of 1D and 2D flows are given. In particular, we investigate the reconstruction and the prediction of shock waves, boundary layers and vortices. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the reduced-order model and the significant reduction of the computational cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new computational framework for a coupled PIC-DSMC tool using multiple GPUs to model the kinetic behavior of electrons in plasma plumes is presented in this work. The disparate length scales of the Debye length and the collisional mean free path are resolved by using separate, independent linearized Morton Z-ordered forest of trees. A 2:1 restraint is imposed for the PIC module to solve partial differential equations in the context of an AMR/Octree framework. The MPI-CUDA parallelization strategies used to implement a preconditioned conjugate gradient method for solving the electrostatic Poisson's equation on the 2:1 octree are discussed and the scaling of the code to near ideal speedup as a function of the number of GPUs is demonstrated. The PIC method is validated using analytical test cases, and the octree-based PIC simulations are found to be ten times more efficient compared to the uniform grid method especially for plume simulations which have large density variations. The computational strategies are then demonstrated with the simulation of collisionless, mesothermal plasma plumes using a kinetic approach for both ions and electrons. The effect of ion mass and electron source location are analyzed by comparing plume dynamics and electron velocity distribution functions. It is shown that a more confined mesothermal plume is observed for the heavier xenon ions, present in electric propulsion devices, compared to protons. The confinement of the xenon plume traps the electrons resulting in higher electron temperatures compared to the proton plasma case. In both the simulations, however, the electron temperature is found to be anisotropic. Finally, when a shifted electron source location case is considered the electron velocity distributions in all three directions are found to be unequal and non-Maxwellian, contrary to the co-located case. The ion beam is observed to attract the electrons, which initially oscillate between the radial edges of the ion beam as confirmed by the bi-modal velocity distribution at early times. As the plume evolves, it electrostatically traps these electrons within the ion beam, allowing them to thermalize, as observed from the single-peak electron velocity distribution functions at later times. These results demonstrate that GPUs can efficiently accelerate computations of a fully kinetic approach to enable the study of electron kinetics and neutralization with the highest physical fidelity.

AB We describe a new spatial discretization of a continuum gyrokinetic Vlasov model in axisymmetric tokamak edge plasma geometries. The geometries are represented using a multiblock decomposition in which logically distinct blocks are smoothly mapped from rectangular computational domains and are aligned with magnetic flux surfaces to accommodate strong anisotropy induced by the magnetic field. We employ a fourth-order, finite-volume discretization in mapped coordinates to mitigate the computational expense associated with discretization on 4D phase space grids. Applied to a conservative formulation of the gyrokinetic system, a finite-volume approach expresses local conservation discretely in a natural manner involving the calculation of normal fluxes at cell faces. In the approach presented here, the normal fluxes are computed in terms of face-averaged velocity normals in such a way that (i) the divergence-free property of the gyrokinetic velocity is preserved discretely to machine precision, (ii) the configuration space normal velocities are independent of mapping metrics, and (iii) the configuration space normal velocities are computed from exact pointwise evaluation of magnetic field data except for one term. The algorithms described in this paper form the foundation of a continuum gyrokinetic edge code named COGENT, which is used here to perform a convergence study verifying the accuracy of the spatial discretization.

AB A three-dimensional problem of monochromatic electromagnetic wave scattering by perfectly conducting body of small thickness is considered. The numerical method for the solution of this problem, based on the relocation of the boundary condition to the median surface is developed. In this method we state a new boundary value problem in the domain outside this surface. The original shape of the body is taken into account due to the boundary conditions. Further, the resulting problem reduces to a system of two integro-differential equations on the median surface. A numerical scheme for solving these equations is developed. This scheme does not degenerate when the body thickness tends to zero. The developed method has been tested by the example of the problem of electromagnetic wave scattering by the body in the form of a rectangular wing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, direct sampling method is considered for determining the location of a set of small, linear perfectly conducting cracks from the collected far-field data corresponding to an incident field. To show the feasibility of the direct sampling method, this study proves that the indicator function of the direct sampling method can be represented by the Bessel function of order zero and the crack lengths. The results of the numerical simulations are shown to support the fact that the imaging performance is highly dependent on the crack lengths. To explain the fact that the imaging performance is highly dependent on the rotation of the cracks, the direct sampling method is further analyzed by establishing a representation using Bessel functions of orders zero and one. Based on the derived representation of indicator function, we design improved direct sampling methods by applying incident fields with multiple directions and multiple frequencies. Corresponding analysis of indicator functions and simulation results are shown for demonstrating the effectiveness and improvements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The work proposes a simple, efficient and unified approach to combat carbuncle phenomenon. The basic idea of this approach is to construct an affordable shock-stable item into numerical flux. This item is acquired by comparing three-wave Roe solver and two-wave HLL solver based on Roe linearization and the projection of difference term. It is consistent with shear viscosity and meantime restrained by the pressure-based sensing function for shear layer. The proposed enhancement is easy to implement and apply within Roe, HLLEM, HLLC, AUSM+, etc. Several well-known cases illuminate its shock robustness and potential application to hypersonic flows.

AB In this paper, a moving reference frame-based gas-kinetic BGK (MRF-BGK) scheme is developed for simulation of viscous flows around arbitrarily moving bodies. Different from most of existing gas-kinetic schemes, the BGK model is now constructed in a general moving reference frame. Due to the non-inertial effects, there will be an additional acceleration term in the Boltzmann equation, which should be carefully defined in order to correctly recover the concerned Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. This recovery actually serves as a basis for developing the present method. Within the finite volume framework, the BGK model with the inclusion of the acceleration term is locally solved and the numerical fluxes at the cell interface can be evaluated. Through this way, the source (acceleration) term effects can be naturally included into the gas evolution process and the resulting fluxes. Considering that explicit BGK schemes may show low efficiency for certain unsteady applications where the physical time scales are significantly larger than the spatial scales, the dual time-stepping approach together with an implicit BGK scheme is employed. Numerical tests show that the developed MRF-BGK scheme can be well applied for several incompressible and compressible viscous flows. The accuracy is shown to be comparable to the moving grid BGK method, however the mesh movement is avoided in the present method. Also as compared with the immersed boundary BGK method, it is more efficient to deal with high-Reynolds number flows. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A general-purpose method is presented and implemented to express analytically one stationary configuration of an ideal 3D elastic rod when the end-to-end relative position and orientation are imposed. The mechanical equilibrium of such a rod is described by ordinary differential equations and parametrized by six scalar quantities. When one end of the rod is anchored, the analytical integration of these equations lead to one unique solution for given values of these six parameters. When the second end is also anchored, six additional nonlinear equations must be resolved to obtain parameter values that fit the targeted boundary conditions. We find one solution of these equations with a zero-finding algorithm, by taking initial guesses from a grid of potential candidates. We exhibit the symmetries of the problem, which reduces drastically the size of this grid and shortens the time of selection of an initial guess. The six variables used in the search algorithm, forces and moments at one end of the rod, are particularly adapted due to their unbounded definition domain. More than 850 000 tests are performed in a large region of configurational space, and in 99.9% of cases the targeted boundary conditions are reached with short computation time and a precision better than 10(-5). We propose extensions of the method to obtain many solutions instead of only one, using numerical continuation or starting from different initial guesses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a fast numerical framework for the computation of acoustic scattering by poroelastic plates of arbitrary geometries. A boundary element method, BEM, is applied to solve the Helmholtz equation subjected to boundary conditions related to structural vibrations. This analysis is performed by rewriting the BEM boundary conditions in terms of a modal basis of the poroelastic plate which is computed by the finite element method, FEM. The current formulation allows a direct solution of the fully coupled fluid-structure interaction problem. In order to accelerate the solution of the large dense linear systems from the BEM formulation in three-dimensional problems, a wideband adaptive multilevel fast multipole method, FMM, is employed. A parametric study is carried out for the trailing-edge scattering of sample acoustic sources, representative of either uncorrelated turbulent eddies or a non-compact turbulent jet. Firstly, the noise scattering by a compact quadrupole source is analyzed for low and high frequencies for square and trapezoidal plates. Results show that geometric features such as trailing-edge sweep and serrations are very effective in the reduction of noise scattering. Moreover, it is shown that finite elastic plates are more effective in reducing the scattered noise at higher frequencies. On the other hand, porosity is more effective in reducing the radiated sound for lower frequencies. Results demonstrate that elasticity and porosity can be combined with trailing-edge sweep and serrations to reduce the scattered noise at a broader range of frequencies for poroelastic plates.

AB We present a hybrid capturing/tracking method for finite volume solvers of compressible flows involving two immiscible fluids that are described by equations of states for ideal gases. The approach is an extension of the two-dimensional level set based in-cell-reconstruction method originally proposed by Smiljanovski et al. [1] for deflagration waves to three-dimensional flows involving interfaces between two immiscible fluids with surface tension forces. The interface motion is captured by an extension to the conservative, un-split geometric volume-of-fluid technique of Owkes and Desjardins [2]. The resulting method is a sharp interface method that avoids time-step restrictions or merging/mixing rules due to cut-cells by using cell-face-aperture averaged waves to update the volume averaged states of cells containing the interface directly. The method furthermore avoids the use of any mixed states in discretization stencils, by reconstructing the pure fluid states in each mixed cell, explicitly enforcing the jump conditions across the interface. Simulations of compressible flows that involve the interaction of shocks with interfaces between immiscible fluids are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

AB We consider a time-dependent diffusion-reaction model for two vector unknowns, satisfying a divergence-free constraint, and the associated scalar Lagrange multiplier. The motivation for studying such a model is provided by a plasma physics problem arising in the modeling of nuclear fusion devices (Braginskii equations), where the two vector unknowns represent ion and electron velocities, the scalar unknown is the electrostatic potential and the divergence-free constraint reflects the physical assumption of quasi-neutrality. We first recast the problem in a form reminiscent of the standard Stokes problem, which allows us to recognize the importance of using a compatible discretization for the vector and scalar unknowns, then propose and analyze a stable finite element formulation. Following this, we address some peculiar geometrical aspects of the model, showing how they can be naturally dealt with within our formulation, and finally discuss a solution procedure for the resulting linear system based on the classical Uzawa algorithm. Some numerical experiments complete the paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies finite element discretizations for three types of time-dependent PDEs, namely heat equation, scalar conservation law and wave equation, which we reformulate as first order systems in a least-squares setting, subject to a space-time conservation constraint (coming from the original PDE). Available piecewise polynomial finite element spaces in (n + 1)-dimensions for functional spaces from the (n + 1)-dimensional de Rham sequence for n = 2,3 are used for the implementation of the method. Computational results illustrating the error behavior, iteration counts and performance of block-diagonal and monolithic geometric multigrid preconditioners are presented for the discrete CFOSLS system. The results are obtained from a parallel implementation of the methods for which we report reasonable scalability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A fourth-order finite-volume Vlasov-Poisson algorithm is developed for simulating axisymmetric plasma configurations in (r, v(r), v(theta)) phase space coordinates. The Vlasov equation for cylindrical phase space coordinates is cast into conservation-law form and is discretized on a structured grid. The conservative finite-volume discretization is based on fifth-order up-wind reconstructions of the distribution function and a fourth-order quadrature rule that accounts for transverse variations of fluxes along control volume surfaces. High-order specular reflection boundary conditions enable high-fidelity treatment of plasma distribution functions at the axis and at wall boundaries. The numerical method is applied to simulate a confined uniform neutral gas to assess convergence properties for an equilibrium system in which effects of finite-temperature and acceleration due to centrifugal and Coriolis forces are present. The discretization is also applied to a Z-pinch configuration to study electrostatic ion confinement and the dynamics of the associated breathing mode. Simulations show that the ion distribution function exhibits non-Maxwellian features and that a temperature anisotropy develops and is sustained. The finite-volume implementation is demonstrated to converge at fourth-order for both applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Modified Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (MHMC) methods combine the ideas behind two popular sampling approaches: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and importance sampling. As in the HMC case, the bulk of the computational cost of MHMC algorithms lies in the numerical integration of a Hamiltonian system of differential equations. We suggest novel integrators designed to enhance accuracy and sampling performance of MHMC methods. The novel integrators belong to families of splitting algorithms and are therefore easily implemented. We identify optimal integrators within the families by minimizing the energy error or the average energy error. We derive and discuss in detail the modified Hamiltonians of the new integrators, as the evaluation of those Hamiltonians is key to the efficiency of the overall algorithms. Numerical experiments show that the use of the new integrators may improve very significantly the sampling performance of MHMC methods, in both statistical and molecular dynamics problems.

AB In this work, droplet-droplet interaction is modelled using a multi-scale approach which couples multiphase flow simulation using a volume of fluid method to a surface thin film model operating on the sub-grid scale. The volume of fluid model is based on a multiple marker method with a smoothed surface tension calculation, and a thin film model is derived to simulate film drainage using a Reynolds equation approach. A novel method of coupling the two allows for the prediction of coalescence or rebound of colliding droplets essentially from first principles, relying only on a critical film thickness parameter. The model is implemented using the open source tool set OpenFOAM and tested against experimental results of colliding hydrocarbon droplets from the literature. It is found to produce accurate interface deformation results for the duration of the collision, and to consistently predict the outcome of the collision process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

DE Embedded boundary method; Non-normal stability; Pseudospectra; Ghost

ID INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOWS; FINITE-DIFFERENCE
AB We present non-normal linear stability of embedded boundary (EB) methods employing pseudospectra and resolvent norms. We analyze the stability of the linear wave equation in a domain with an embedded boundary in one and two dimensions. In particular, we characterize the stability in terms of the normalized distance of the EB to the nearest ghost node (alpha). An important objective is that the CFL condition remains unaffected by the EB which is taken to be that of the underlying grid (as if the EB is absent or aligned with the regular grid). We consider various spatial and temporal discretization methods including both central and upwind-biased schemes. Stability is guaranteed when alpha <= alpha(max) where alpha(max) ranges between 0.5 and 0.77 depending on the discretization scheme. The stability analysis is also briefly examined for the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Sharper limits on the sufficient conditions for stability are obtained based on the pseudospectral radius (the Kreiss constant) than the restrictive limits based on the usual singular value decomposition analysis. A resulting sufficient condition for stability is that the intersection of the EB with the surface normal passing through a ghost node ((x) over right arrow (g)) must lie within the ghost cell (0.5 Lambda x distance from (x) over right arrow (g)). This condition leads us to propose a simple and robust reclassification scheme for the ghost cells (dubbed "hybrid ghost cells") to ensure Lax stability of the discrete system. This has been tested successfully for both low and high order discretization schemes with transient growth of at most O(1). Moreover, we present a fourth order EB reconstruction scheme taking into account both accuracy and stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB New ceramics with CoZrTa2O8 formula were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction method. The phase composition of all sintered samples was confirmed as a single phase with monoclinic wolframite structure belonged to the P2/c space group. The grain growth was analyzed through the investigation of relative density and grain size. The dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) was discussed with relative density, polarizability and porosity. The quality factors (Q x f) were analyzed by considering grain growth and atomic packing fraction. The temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (tau(f)) had no significant change under different sintering temperature. The typical microwave dielectric properties of CoZrTa2O8 ceramics were epsilon(r) = 23.54, Q x f = 20,100 GHz, and tau(f) = -8.72 ppm/degrees C, sintered at 1250 degrees C for 4 h. Considering the low dielectric loss and near-zero tau(f) value, CoZrTa2O8 ceramics should be good candidates for microwave device application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile, simple route for modifying the structural and morphological architecture of trivalent europium ion doped yttrium orthophosphates through pH tuning is described. SEM analysis confirmed the evolution of different architectural morphology through pH tuning. Additionally, the possible mechanism for the selective control of the phase structure and morphological evolution of YPO4:5 Eu3+ was well ascertained. The results strongly augmented that the control phase transformation from hexagonal to tetragonal structure presented a remarkable change in luminescent properties. This change was rationally evaluated, and the influence of the phase and shape on optical properties was well explored. It hints that we can synthesize multi-functional materials by controlling the shape and structure of yttrium orthophosphates. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The rationally designed one-dimensional (1D) porous CeVO4 nanobelts have been prepared by electrospinning process and the band structure and density of states are simulated by DFT method. As an excellent photocatalyst for visible light degradation of methylene blue (MB) solution, 1D porous CeVO4 nanobelts possess the stable crystal structure, which contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic stability. Accordingly, the 1D belt structures are beneficial to promoting the separation and migration of charge carriers, reducing diffusion length, and providing rich catalytically active sites for photoeletrochemical reactions. Benefiting from these structural and compositional features, CeVO4 nanobelts exhibit the excellent photocatalytic performance and recycling ability, compared with individual CeVO4 powders upon simulated sunlight irradiation.

AB A novel approach to prepare graphene nanosheets was developed by exfoliating graphene oxide (GO) assisted with oxalic acid (H2C2O4). The expansion and reduction of GO were synchronously fulfilled through the decomposition of H2C2O4 impregnated into the interlayer of GO. The structure of the as-exfoliated graphene nanosheets were determined by a series of characterizations. The results showed that the as-exfoliated graphene nanosheets possessed ca. 10-layered thickness and the lower oxygen content. The mechanism was proposed that H2C2O4 played a role of the expansion-reduction associated effect in exfoliation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Al-Cu alloy was friction stir welded (FSWed) with Al-Zn and Al-Mg alloys, respectively. Tensile properties, strain hardening behavior and fracture mechanisms of the FSWed dissimilar joints were evaluated. Results reveal that the strain-hardening rate of Al-Cu/Al-Zn dissimilar joint is higher than that of base metals due to the presence of finer recrystallized grains in the stir zone, while the strain-hardening rate of Al-Cu/Al-Mg dissimilar joint lies in-between those of base metals. The hardening level of Al-Cu/Al-Zn joint after tensile deformation, defined as HVf /HVw (a ratio of microhardness of fractured joints to that of as-welded joints), exhibits an 'M' shape across the welded joint.

TI Achieving highly tunable negative permittivity in titanium
   nitride/polyimide nanocomposites via controlled DC bias

AB Metacomposites with negative permittivity that derived from random structures have drawn considerable attention. Nowadays, negative permittivity was commonly realized in percolative composites via controlling the compositions and microstructures. Herein, highly tunable plasma-like negative permittivities were successfully achieved in titanium nitride/polyimide nanocomposites via applying external DC bias. It is indicated that the trapped charges at the interfaces between titanium nitride and polyimide can escape from the interfaces after absorbing energy from DC bias, resulting in elevated concentration of free charges and enhanced plasma oscillations, hence the enhanced plasma frequencies and negative permittivities. This work demonstrated that applying DC bias is an effective way to achieve highly tailorable negative permittivity, which is of great significance to the exploration of high-performance negative-k metacomposites.

   Sustainable technology
AB India is one of the Developing countries that needs to face the environmental pollution. We have many ways to reduce environmental pollution that causes by production of Portland cement and by the increasing of waste material. Geopolymer is the term used to represent the binders produced by polymeric reaction of alkaline liquid with silicon and aluminium as source materials. Common river sand is expensive due to excessive cost of transportation from natural sources. Also large-scale depletion of these sources creates environmental problems. River sand is most commonly used fine aggregate in the production of concrete poses the problem of acute shortage in many areas. In such a situation the Quarry rock dust can be an economic alternative to the river sand.
   Quarry Rock Dust can be defined as residue, tailing or other non-voluble waste material after the extraction and processing of rocks to form fine particles less than 4.75 mm. This paper presents the feasibility of the usage of Quarry Rock Dust as a substitute for Natural Sand in geopolymer mortar. The by-product materials considered in this study are combination of GGBFS and Fly ash. The experimental program involves casting of geopolymer mortar cubes by using GGBFS, Flyash and Quarry rock dust and testing them at 1 day, 3 days and 7 days for compressive strength. Different parameter considered in this study is alkaline fluid to binder ratio Keeping 12-Molarity of the alkaline liquid and the ratio of sodium hydroxide to sodium meta silicate as constant (1:2).

AB The current study reports the swift synthesis of high strength nanocrystalline magnesium silicide (Mg2Si) doped with bismuth (Bi) of 0-0.025 at.% via spark plasma assisted combustion synthesis. The proposed synthesis approach is rapid (similar to 54 min) against the conventional liquid and solid state synthesis routes which warrants prolong duration. XRD and TEM studies reveal the in-situ evolution of Mg2Si phase and substantial doping of Bi. The synthesized Mg2Si compound exhibits higher density (>95). Mg2Si0.975-Bi-0.025 demonstrates the benchmarked Vickers hardness of 484.2 +/- 15.44 Hv(1) and un-doped Mg2Si shows the excellent fracture toughness of 2.09 +/- 0.03 MPa root m.

AB The coal-based energy production in China generates more than 600 million tons of coal fly ash (CFA) each year, which drives us searching for new methods for recycling CFA. In this work, continuous glass fibers with a range of CFA (25-45%) were successfully prepared without showing any sign of fiber crystallization. The measured fiber tensile strength was found to increase with CFA proportionally. The fiber derived from 45% CFA exhibited the best tensile strength (higher than the E glass fiber prepared/tested under the same conditions) and good chemical stability (98% mass retention in the acid corrosion test). Our study shows a feasibility of making continuous CFA derived glass fibers with high iron oxide content and an alternative way for CFA recycling. Its improved strength and good chemical durability can benefit both economy and environmental protection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silver nanoparticles have been synthetized and deposited on cp Ti substrates in one-step process by the use of laser ablation in open air. The nanoparticles are produced by ablating Ag foil using two different lasers and an inert gas jet oriented into the interaction zone to prevent oxidation and to direct the ablated material to the substrate. The HRTEM images and FFT confirmed the crystalline nature of the obtained silver nanoparticles with the presence of oxidized ones, while FE-SEM revealed that the nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on Ti substrates. The Ag-containing Ti substrates showed good antibacterial activity against Lactobacillus salivarius. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the weld metal, Fe2Zr intermetallic phase was observed and its average hardness and fracture toughness are 19.3 GPa and 2.52 MPam(1/2), respectively. It was noticed that radial cracks initiated from the corners of the impressions. Fine lamellar structure (alpha Fe + Fe2Zr) with an average hardness of 7.5 GPa were observed but no cracks were observed when subjected to a peak load of 300 mN. A simple model was developed to explain possible phase formation mechanism in the Fe-Zr system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An 8 week pilot implantation study in a rabbit femoral defect model was conducted to evaluate the local response to new bone cement materials. The materials demonstrated favorable tissue responses with evidence of direct new bone formation. Counter to the literature, there were no beneficial effects associated with strontium releasing biomaterials. Nevertheless, highly hydrophilic glass filled cements may present benefit through rapid surface mineralization, and in vivo swelling, providing a press fit coupling to bone. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The novel open-cell Mg-8Gd-2Zn (wt%) foams containing long-period stacking order (LPSO) phase were fabricated. The compressive properties of the as-cast Mg-8Gd-2Zn foams and AZ91D foams at different temperatures were investigated. The experimental results show that the Mg-8Gd-2Zn foams mainly consist of alpha-Mg, LPSO and (Mg,Zn)(3)Gd phase. As compared to the AZ91D foams, the Mg-8Gd-2Zn foams exhibit lower compressive strength at room temperature or 100 degrees C, but higher compressive strength at 200 degrees C or 300 degrees C. The energy absorption capacity of the foams is also improved at 300 degrees C. The enhanced compressive properties of the foams at elevated temperatures can be attributed to the high thermal stability of LPSO phase. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

L1(0)-Mn55Ga45/FeCo composites were synthesized by cryogenic ball milling. In three different bathes, the FeCo mass percentage was controlled as 5%, 10% and 15%, respectively. The magnetic exchange coupling between FeCo and L1(0)-Mn55Ga45 was investigated by VSM. The results showed that when FeCo was 5% and 10%, effective exchange coupling and increased maximum energy product were observed in the composites. However, when the FeCo mass percentage was increased to 15%, both magnetic exchange coupling and maximum energy products were reduced in the composite. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigated the influence of isothermal holding time on characteristics of nano-scale transition carbide and interfaces of tempered high-carbon martensitic steel processed by sub-zero treatment (SZT). We interpreted a stress-induced activity of carbon atoms through SZT prior to tempering, which was crucial for obtaining desirable precipitation of transition carbide. The modification upon interfaces under the influence of transition carbide characteristics was recognized for the first time and discussed based on mechanism of precipitate-interface interaction in relation to the nanohardness value.

AB A novel hybrid material, containing alternating layers of molybdenum oxide covalently bonded to the electron-rich 3,8-phenanthroline as the spacer molecules, has recently been realised. The structure of [MoO3(3,8-phenanthroline)(0.5)] consists of corner-shared {MoO5 N} octahedra where the Raman spectra correlate very well with the structural data. It is demonstrated here that the choice of the ligands used can influence the oxidation state of the metal cations and the vibrational characteristics of the Mo-O/Mo-N bonds. Previous magnetization measurements indicated that the susceptibility changes only slightly with temperature in the high-temperature region with a surprising magnetic ordering at low temperature, which we can now attribute the latter to the presence of Mo cations in lower oxidation state. The presence of these reduced species was indicated from our revised structural refinement analysis and supported by surface spectroscopic analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hollow structured Si-Ni-C composite nanofabric was fabricated by electrospinning combined with thermal treatment. The hollow structure was obtained by calcining the precursory Si-NiO-C nanofabric under Ar atmosphere without using any sacrificial material. The resultant hollow structure could accommodate the volume effect of Si during Li-ion insertion and extraction. The NiO was reduced to Ni simultaneously with the calcination, which could increase the conductivity of the nanofabric. The hollow Si-Ni-C nanofabric formed a freestanding conductive structure which can be directly used as electrode for Li-ion batteries. The obtained self-supported anode delivered a capacity of 622 mAh/g after 100 cycles. The anode also presented a stable rate performance at 2000 mA/g. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we have fabricated the reduced graphene oxide/manganese ferrite (RGO/MnFe2O4) hybrid composites by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. The obtained MnFe(2)O(4 )particles exhibited the uniquely cubic morphology with an average particle size of 100.6 nm, which were uniformly attached to the surface of RGO sheets. Results demonstrated that both the ratio of RGO to MnFe2O4 and filling ratio had notable effects on the microwave absorption performance of the as-prepared hybrid composites. Moreover, the hybrid composites showed the characteristics of thin thickness, broad bandwidth and strong absorption. Significantly, the hybrid composite with a filling ratio of 70 wt% (S2) exhibited the best microwave absorption performance, i.e. the minimum reflection loss reached -47.5 dB and effective absorption bandwidth (less than -10 dB) was 5.2 GHz for a thickness of only 1.7 mm. Therefore, the RGO/MnFe2O4 hybrid composites could be potential candidates for application in microwave absorption. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photocatalytic activity of low band gap hydrogenated HfO2 doped TiO2 (H-HfO2/TiO2), HfO2 doped TiO2 (HfO2/TiO2) and TiO2 (pristine) were investigated by photocatalytic degradation of five different industrial dyes. The current study envisages the effect of doping hydrogen and HfO2 up on TiO2 for photocatalytic degradation of different chemically structured dyes. Methylene Blue attains fast degradation efficiency of 90%, within 10 min of the reaction due to high photocatalytic adsorption and degradation over the rough TiO2 surface. Effect of pH on dye degradation is observed, leading to disintegration and mineralization. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents an intelligent human trajectory destination detection system from video. The system assumes a passive collection of video from a wide scene used by humans in their daily motion activities such as walking towards a door. The proposed system includes three main modules, namely human blob detection, star skeleton detection and destination area prediction, and it works directly with raw video, producing motion features for destination prediction system, such as position, velocity and acceleration from detected human skeletons, resulting in several input features that are used to train a machine learning classifier. We adopted a university campus exterior scene for the experimental study, which includes 348 pedestrian trajectories from 171 videos and five destination areas: A, B, C, D and E. A total of six data processing combinations and four machine learning classifiers were compared, under a realistic growing window evaluation. Overall, high quality results were achieved by the best model, which uses 37 skeleton motion inputs, undersampling on training data and a random forest. The global discrimination, in terms of area of the receiver operating characteristic curve is around 87%. Furthermore, the best model can predict in advance the five destination classes, obtaining a very good ahead discrimination for classes A, B, C and D, and a reasonable ahead discrimination for class E.

AB Nonlinear optimization is an active line of research, given the wide range of scientific fields that benefit from its development. In the last years, the meta-heuristics proved to be one of the most effective methods to tackle difficult optimization problems, providing an alternative in cases where exact methods would be unfeasible. In this work, we present a method based on the Iterative Topographical Global Optimization meta-heuristic, which we call C-ITGO, incorporating specific mechanisms to solve nonlinearly constrained optimization problems. We use the method developed in this work to optimize eight complex engineering design problems and compare the results obtained here against those obtained with several other methods found in the literature. In the tests performed, C-ITGO outperforms all competing methods, achieving state of the art results for the problems considered. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Novel set of general descriptive features for enhanced detection of
   malicious emails using machine learning methods
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English

DE Email; Detection; Machine learning; Analysis; Malware; Features
ID CLASSIFICATION; ACCURACY; AUC
AB In recent years, cyber-attacks against businesses and organizations have increased. Such attacks usually result in significant damage to the organization, such as the loss and/or leakage of sensitive and confidential information. Because email communication is an integral part of daily business operations, attackers frequently leverage email as an attack vector in order to initially penetrate the targeted organization. Email message allows the attacker to deliver dangerous content to the victim, such as malicious attachments or links to malicious websites. Existing email analysis solutions analyze only specific parts of the email using rule-based methods, while other important parts remain unanalyzed. Existing anti-virus engines primarily use signature-based detection methods, and therefore are insufficient for detecting new unknown malicious emails. Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective at detecting maliciousness in various domains and particularly in email. Previous works which used machine learning methods suggested sets of features which offer a limited perspective over the whole email message. In this paper, we propose a novel set of general descriptive features extracted from all email components (header, body, and attachments) for enhanced detection of malicious emails using machine learning methods. The proposed features are extracted just from the email itself; therefore, our features are independent, since the extraction process does not require an Internet connection or the use of external services or other tools, thereby meeting the needs of real-time detection systems. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our new novel features against sets of features suggested by previous academic work using a collection of 33,142 emails which contains 38.73% malicious and 61.27% benign emails. The results show that malicious emails can be detected effectively when using our novel features with machine learning algorithms. Moreover, our novel features enhance the detection of malicious emails when used in conjunction with features suggested by related work. The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest detection rates, with an AUC of 0.929, true positive rate (TPR) of 0.947, and false positive rate (FPR) of 0.03. We also present the IDR (integrated detection rate), a new measure which helps calibrate the threshold of a machine learning classifier in order to achieve the optimal TP and FP rates, which are the most important measures for a real-time and practical cyber-security application.

AB Cloud computing and data centers that support this paradigm are rapidly evolving in order to satisfy new demands. These ever-growing needs represent an energy-related challenge to achieve sustainability and cost reduction. In this paper, we define an expert and intelligent system that applies various energy policies. These policies are employed to maximize the energy-efficiency of data-center resources by simulating a realistic environment and heterogeneous workload in a trustworthy tool. An environmental and economic impact of around 20% of energy consumption can be saved in high-utilization scenarios without exerting any noticeable impact on data-center performance if an adequate policy is applied.

AB Automatic language identification (LID) in practical environments is gaining a lot of scientific attention due to rapid developments in multilingual speech processing applications. When an LID is operated in noisy environments a degradation in the performance can be observed and it can be majorly attributed to mismatch between the training and operating environments. This work is aimed towards developing an LID system that can robustly operate in clean and noisy environments. Traditionally, to reduce the mismatch between training and operating environments, noise is synthetically induced to the training corpus and these models are termed as multi-SNR models. In this work, various curriculum learning strategies are explored to train multi-SNR models, such that the trained models have better generalization in performance over varying background environments. I-vector, Deep neural networks (DNN) and DNN With Attention (DNN-WA) architectures are used in this work for developing LID systems, Experimental verification of the proposed approach is carried out using IIIT-H Indian database and AP17-OLR database. The performance of LID system is tested at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels using white and vehicular noises from NOISEX dataset. In comparison to multi-SNR models, the LID systems trained with curriculum learning have performed better in terms of equal error rate (EER) and generalization in EER across varying background environments. The degradation in the performance of LID systems due to environmental noise has been effectively reduced by training multi-SNR models using curriculum learning. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hubs are special facilities widely found in distribution systems acting mainly as transshipment and switching points, being used to concentrate and consolidate flows. Every hub is subjected to a disruption of its functionality, called interdiction, that can be caused by many reasons such as natural disasters or even intentional attacks. Interdictions result in an efficiency loss to the system, substantially increasing the total distribution cost. A way to mitigate the impact caused by interdictions is fortifying some hubs, avoiding them to be interdicted. This context naturally leads to the multiple allocation r-hub interdiction median problem with fortification, which consists of identifying q hubs to be fortified in a multiple allocation hub-and-spoke supply network, knowing that r hubs will be interdicted. We assume that the set of hubs chosen to be interdicted is the one that causes the highest increase in the total distribution cost. For this bilevel problem, we propose an integer linear programming formulation with an exponential number of constraints that is solved through a branch-and-cut algorithm. Our results show that our method requires less computational time than the exact algorithm found in the literature, being able to optimally solve several large instances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a hybrid genetic programming (GP) with multiple genes is implemented for developing prediction models of spectral energy demands. A multi-objective strategy is used for maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the complexity of the models. Both structural properties and earthquake characteristics are considered in prediction models of four demand parameters. Here, the earthquake records are classified based on soil type assuming that different soil classes have linear relationships in terms of GP genes. Therefore, linear regression analysis is used to connect genes for different soil types, which results in a total of sixteen prediction models. The accuracy and effectiveness of these models were assessed using different performance metrics and their performance was compared with several other models. The results indicate that not only the proposed models are simple, but also they outperform other spectral energy demand models proposed in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Fuzzy PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation) method allows one to capture uncertainty and imprecision of input data of a decision problem as well as the uncertainty of the decision-maker's preferences. However, a considerable number of implementations of the Fuzzy PROMETHEE method are burdened with some imperfections related to, among other things, a high level of complexity, an applied computational procedure or the incompatibility with the classical PROMETHEE method paradigms. The article presents a new fuzzy MCDM method called NEAT F-PROMETHEE (New Easy Approach To Fuzzy PROMETHEE) characterized by low complexity, conformity with the methodological assumptions of the classical PROMETHEE method and the improvement of the process of mapping fuzzy numbers from a space X on Y with the use of the correction mechanism while mapping. Furthermore, other improvements have been introduced which are to simplify the computational procedure and increase its clarity for the sake of the decision-maker. The prepared method and its results have been compared to other Fuzzy PROMETHEE implementations, the classical PROMETHEE method as well as the Fuzzy TOPSIS method. In the research, it has been found out that the correction mechanism and other improvements applied in NEAT F-PROMETHEE make it possible to obtain a higher computational accuracy what results in a higher credibility of the solution of a decision problem in comparison with many other Fuzzy PROMETHEE implementations. The advantage of the prepared method over more complex implementations is its simplicity, easiness of application and interpretation of results. It has also been indicated that uncertainty of input data and uncertainty of the decision-maker's preferences are related to each other and the relationship is expressed by grouped relations of preferences, that is, preference, J-preference and outranking.

AB Different oak species or origins have been studied to find an alternative to traditional ones and Quercus humboldtii from Colombia is a candidate. Some studies analyse the composition of this oak, but no work has been found to study its use for wine treatment. The aim was to evaluate volatile composition of toasted Q. humboldtii oak chips and the wines treated with these chips. To evaluate its oenological potential Q. alba and Q. petraea have been included in this trial. The wines were subjected to a sensory analysis. Results indicated that oak chips and wines macerated for 90 days with toasted Colombian chips exhibited higher 5-methylfurfural, guaiacol, trans-isoeugenol and syringol concentrations than others, while the furfural and cis-beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone content was lower. Sensory analysis showed that the wines treated with Colombian oak presented more notes of smoked and less of coconut. Therefore, this oak could probably be considered suitable for ageing.

AB Resveratrol exhibits many health benefits; however, low water-solubility and instability under processing conditions such as heating can be some of the main challenges for its processing and formulation. Here the complexation of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) with resveratrol was investigated to improve its solubility and stability. The solubility of resveratrol in water was determined as 7 mg/100 ml. Resveratrol-beta-Lg nanoparticles (181.8 nm) were produced at pH 6 and 75 degrees C for 45 min. Heating resveratrol solutions at 75 degrees C for 45 min resulted in isomerization of resveratrol and reduced antioxidant activity. However, resveratrol-beta-Lg nanocomplexes which had undergone the same heat treatment exhibited improved antioxidant activity. Heating under pasteurisation conditions led to similar results and both native beta-Lg and nanoparticles exhibited a protective effect against heat-induced chemical changes in resveratrol, resulting in enhanced antioxidant activity. Fluorescence measurements revealed strong interactions of resveratrol with both native protein and nanoparticles.

Transfer parameters evaluated from the data suggest that competition among various interactions exists at low and high molalities of KCl(aq.) solutions. The increase in bitterness and decrease in hydration number of methylxanthines with the m(B) values have been observed. The dehydration effect of KCl(aq.) at low molalities on the methylxanthines has also been established using ITC. Positive change in the chemical shifts (H-1 NMR) and increase in absorption intensity (UV-vis) of methylxanthines in the presence of KCl(aq.) further support our results.

AB Tristyrylphenol ethoxylates (TSPxEOs), nonionic surfactant adjuvants, are widely used to replace alkylphenols in many agricultural formulations. Herein, a rapid and sensitive method based on a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe "QuEChERS" and supercritical fluid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) method was developed to quantify TSPxEOs in cucumber, leaves, and soil. Following optimization, the tested oligomers were fully separated within 8 min. The matrix-matched calibration standards showed satisfactory linearity with coefficients of determination (R-2) >= 0.991. The limits of quantification (LOQs: 0.001-0.048 mu g kg(-1)) were excellent for TSPxEOs (x=6-29). The average recoveries at three (low, medium, and high) fortification levels were ranged between 62.5% and 112.9% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) <= 20.0% for TSPxEOs (x=6-29) in various matrices. The method was successfully applied to determine TSPxEOs residual levels in field-incurred samples. Conclusively, the developed method is versatile and could be used for monitoring TSPxEOs in food and environmental samples.

AB A variety of food and drink samples (n=21) were analyzed to evaluate the presence of (nano-) particles in their composition. After assessment of the sample pre-treatment step, a fast screening analysis was performed for drinks by Dynamic Light Scattering showing particles from 10 to 300 nm that could correspond to organic or metallic NPs. Metallic NPs were identified in foods by Single-Particle mode Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and Asymmetrical Flow Field-Flow Fractionation coupled to Multiangle Laser Light Scattering and Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The determination of Ti, Si and Ag concentration in the initial food suspensions, after filtration and centrifugal ultrafiltration enabled to estimate the ionic and nanoparticles content. Si-containing particles can be present in cappuccino powder as large aggregates and Si-and Al-containing particles in hot chocolate. Ti-containing NPs (80-200 nm) were found in chewing gum and Ag NPs in silver pearls (50-150 nm) used for decoration pastry.

AB Injera is an Ethiopian flat bread that is mostly made from tef flour. Injera making on an industrial scale holds a significant economic and social interest but requires a thorough study of how the process variables affect the product quality. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of mill type (hammer, disc, and blade) on injera sensory quality and starch digestibility. The application of software for the determination of injera quality descriptors and its comparison with visual human eye evaluation was also established. Injera made with disc mill flour had higher overall acceptability (6.6) than that obtained from hammer mill (4.2) and blade mill (4.1) flours. The injera made with blade mill flour obtained the lowest rapidly available glucose and rapidly digestible starch. The outcome of introducing software for the determinations of injera number of eyes was found effective; its difference with human eye determination was insignificant.

AB Untargeted metabolomics unraveled the effects of varying substrates (soybean, wheat, and rice) and inocula (Aspergillus oryzae and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) on metabolite compositions of koji, a starter ingredient in various Asian fermented foods. Multivariate analyses of the hyphenated mass spectrometry datasets for different koji extracts highlighted 61 significantly discriminant primary metabolites (sugars and sugar alcohols, organic acids, amino acids, fatty acids, nucleosides, phenolic acids, and vitamins) according to varying substrates and inocula combinations. However, 59 significantly discriminant secondary metabolites were evident for koji-types with varying substrates only, viz., soybean (flavonoids, soyasaponins, and lysophospholipids), wheat (flavones and lysophospholipids), and rice (flavonoids, fatty acids derivatives, and lysophospholipids). Independently, the substrates influenced primary metabolite compositions in koji (soybean > wheat, rice). The inocula choice of A. oryzae engendered higher carbohydrates, organic acids, and lipid derivative levels commensurate with high alpha-amylase and beta-glucosidase activities, while B. amyloliquefaciens affected higher amino acids levels, in respective koji types.

AB The present study was aimed at the investigation, through HPLCDAD-ESI-MS/MS, of polyphenols in seven autochthonous C. intybus varieties, already known from literature to contain various substances with antioxidant properties, from the Veneto region of Italy, namely 'Castelfranco', 'Chioggia', 'Rosa di Gorizia', 'Rosa di Verona', 'Treviso Precoce', 'Treviso Tardivo' and 'Verdon da Cortel'. Thirteen polyphenols, belonging to hydroxycinnamic acid, flavone, flavonol and anthocyanin classes, were detected in most samples. The developed analytical method was validated in agreement with ICH guidelines. The total amount of polyphenols ranged from 52 to 386 (mean: 254) mg/100g fresh weight (F.W.). The results were further confirmed by Principal Composition Analysis (PCA), which highlighted peculiar features and similarities among analysed samples for each variety (except for 'Chioggia' samples). The developed method is suitable for routine analyses, as well as geographical characterization, selection of different C. intybus varieties and for the determination of related polyphenols dietary recommended intakes.

AB Despite the evident influence of the cultivar on olive oil composition, few studies have been devoted to exploring the variability of phenols in a representative number of monovarietal olive oils. In this study, oil samples from 80 cultivars selected for their impact on worldwide oil production were analyzed to compare their phenolic composition by using a method based on LC-MS/MS. Secoiridoid derivatives were the most concentrated phenols in virgin olive oil, showing high variability that was significantly due to the cultivar. Multivariate analysis allowed discrimination between four groups of cultivars through their phenolic profiles: (i) richer in aglycon isomers of oleuropein and ligstroside; (ii) richer in oleocanthal and oleacein; (iii) richer in flavonoids; and (iv) oils with balanced but reduced phenolic concentrations. Additionally, correlation analysis showed no linkage among aglycon isomers and oleocanthal/oleacein, which can be explained by the enzymatic pathways involved in the metabolism of both oleuropein and ligstroside.

AB We have previously reported on the antioxidant potential of Artocarpus heterophyllus J33 (AhJ33) variety fruit waste from different extraction methods. In the study, the rind maceration extract (RDM) exhibited the highest phenolic and polyphenolic contents and strongest antioxidant potential measured by the DPPH assay (R-2 = 0.99). In this paper, we now report on the bioassay-guided fractionation of the active ethyl acetate (EtOAC) fraction of RDM and its TOF-LCMS analysis. Seven sub-fractions resulting from the chromatographic separation of the EtOAC fraction showed radical scavenging activities between 80 and 94% inhibition. Subsequent LCMS analysis led to the identification of fifteen compounds comprising 5 phenolics and 10 nonphenolic compounds, 11 of which are reported for the first time from AhJ33 variety. Most of the identified compounds have been reported to possess antioxidant activity in many previous studies. This indicates that AhJ33 is a promising source of antioxidants for the development of food and nutraceutical products.

AB Nisin and natamycin are natural preservatives used in a broad range of food products. In the present study, the stability of an aqueous nisin/natamycin blend (pH 4.0) for the beverage market was tested at room temperature (22 degrees C) under dark conditions by means of liquid chromatography. Both an HPLC-UV and a UPLC-MS method were developed to monitor the concentration of natamycin and nisin, respectively.
   After 6 months at room temperature (22 degrees C) under dark conditions, the nisin/natamycin blend (pH 4.0) still contained 85% of the original amount of nisin and 95% of natamycin. Even after 1 year, 50% of nisin and 90% of natamycin remained in the formulation. The resulting degradation products were studied by means of high resolution mass spectrometry. For both nisin and natamycin, degradation products originating from hydration (natamycin+ H2O; nisin+ H2O) and oxidation reactions (natamycin+ O; nisin+ O; nisin+ 2O) were observed.

AB Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), the main green tea component, is intensively studied for its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-cancer effects. In the present study, a screen on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion library was performed to identify conditions under which EGCG had deleterious rather than beneficial effects. Two genes were identified whose deletion resulted in sensitivity to EGCG: FET3 and FTR1, encoding the components of the Fet3/Ftr1 high-affinity iron uptake system, also involved in Cu(I)/Cu(II) balance on the surface of yeast cells. The presence of EGCG in the growth medium induced the production of Cu (I), with deleterious effects on fet3 Delta and ftr1 Delta cells. Additionally, when combined, physiological surpluses of Cu (II) and EGCG acted in synergy not only against fet3 Delta and ftr1 Delta, but also against wild type cells, by generating surplus Cu(I) in the growth medium. The results imply that caution should be taken when combining EGCG-rich beverages/nutraceuticals with copper-rich foods.

AB This is the first report investigating the effects of cultivation, growth under full sunlight (MSL) or shade (MS), and processing (drying, sapeco and roasting) on the composition and antioxidant potential of mate. Samples were roasted (180 degrees C, 200 degrees C, 220 degrees C or 240 degrees C) for a fixed time (10 min) or roasted (10, 20, 30 or 40 min) at a fixed temperature (200 degrees C). HPLC/UV/MS analysis and measures of total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition and soybean oil oxidation) were used to analyse phytochemicals. There were significant differences (p < 0.05, ANOVA/Tukey) in phenolics between MS and MSL samples following certain processing steps, but Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated no distinction between MS and MSL samples, suggesting that light intensity had no effect on phenolics. Caffeine increased significantly (p < 0.05) in MS samples. Temperature was more important than time, since pyrolysis of phenolics was more intense at 240 degrees C.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant activity and the homology of peptides extracted from dry-cured Xuanwei and Jinhua ham. The antioxidant activity of crude peptides was assessed by ORAC and ABTS assays and the scavenging effects on DPPH and O2-. free radicals. LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used to analyze the peptide composition. Based on the identified peptides, homologous proteins were matched by the Peaks software. Overall, 243 and 213 peptides were identified with their parent proteins in Xuanwei and Jinhua dry-cured hams. Based on the ORAC and TEAC values, XHP showed higher antioxidant ability than JHP (P < 0.05). After further purification by G-15 chromatography, the results indicate that the oligopeptides with less than 1000 Da had greater antioxidant activity than the other two fractions. Homology-based proteomics showed that the majority of peptides originated from myosin which accounted for 26% in XHP and 32% in JHP respectively.

AB The presence of monomeric and dimeric flavan-3-ol monohexosides was investigated in grapes and wines. Polyphenol extracts were prepared from grape seeds and skins (Syrah, Merlot, and Cabernet-Sauvignon) sampled at three different developmental stages. Different wines (Tannat, Alicante, Syrah, Merlot, and Grenache) were also studied. The different samples obtained were analyzed by UPLC-ESI-IT-MS. Specific molecular ions corresponding to flavan-3-ol hexosides were detected by using targeted molecular ions with specific m/z values: 451 for (epi) catechin hexosides, and 739 for procyanidin dimer hexosides. 4'-O-beta-glucosyl-(+)-catechin and 7-O-beta-glucosyl-(+)-catechin were obtained by using a glucosyl transferase from apple, UGT71A15, and their structures determined by NMR. These glucosylated monomers and the dimers were identified in all analyzed grape seed and several skin extracts at the different stages and in wines made from different varieties.

The effect of mesh size and core: wall ratio (w/w) on the product yield and encapsulation efficiency of these apocarotenoids was examined. Nanoencapsulates were characterized and their stability was examined in the presence or absence of a strong phenolic antioxidant, the caffeic acid, under thermal and in vitro gastrointestinal conditions. Spherical particles were obtained. Product yield and encapsulation efficiency (%) of crocins and picrocrocin was found to be satisfactory. Thermal stability and bioaccessibility of these apocarotenoids was enhanced by nanoencapsulation. Further protection was provided by caffeid acid.

AB Nanoemulsions containing 0.5% w/w corn oil enriched with 0.4% w/w curcumin, sodium-alginate (1.0% w/w) and 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0% w/w of surfactant, were assessed, including particle size (nm), zeta-potential (mV) and turbidity over time. Furthermore, nanoemulsions encapsulation efficiency (EE), antioxidant capacity (AC) and release kinetics were studied. Nanoemulsions showed particle sizes <= 400 +/- 3 nm and effectively reduced droplets interfacial tension with negative zeta-potential values (<= - 37 mV), regardless the concentration of surfactant. Nanoemulsions with 2.0% w/w lecithin did not suffer destabilization phenomena during almost 86 days of experiment, whereas those containing Tween 20 or SMP at the same concentrations were destabilized after 5 days or along 24 h, respectively. Despite EE of nanoemulsions was above 75%, just in lecithin-stabilized nanoemulsions it was directly correlated to AC. Therefore, this work contributes to elucidate the influence of lecithin, Tween 20 and SMP on curcumin encapsulation and stabilization of curcumin-loaded nanoemulsions.

AB The alpha-glucosidase inhibition effects of the 80% ethanol extracts in the seeds of five Vigna species (V. nakashimae, V. nipponensis, V. umbellate, V. radiate, and V. angularis) were evaluated and their half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values showed considerable differences (p < 0.05) ranging from 7.3 to > 900 mu g/ml. V. nakashimae exhibited the most potent inhibition with IC50 value of 7.3 +/- 1.1 mu g/ml, followed by V. nipponensis (184.0 +/- 9.5 mu g/ml) and V. umbellata (520.0 +/- 8.1 mu g/ml). Bioactivity-guided fractionation of V. nakashimae seeds yielded three phenolics by silica gel chromatography and their structures were elucidated as gambiriin D (1), luteoliflavan-7-O-glucopyranoside (2), and catechin-7-O-glucopyranoside (3) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In particular, gambiriin D (1) possessed strong inhibition activity with IC50 of 36.8 +/- 2.3 mu M through simple reversible slow-binding inhibition (kinetic parameters: k(4)= 0.0048 mu M(-1)s(-1); K-i(app)= 48 mu M). Furthermore, this compound inhibited recombinant human aldose reductase with IC50 value of 12.0 +/- 0.7 mu M. Results suggest that V. nakashimae may be a potent alpha-glucosidase inhibition for health products.

AB In order to evaluate the effects of magnetic nanoparticles plus microwave (MNPMT) or far-infrared (MNPFT) thawing on protein conformation changes and moisture migration of red seabream (Pagrus major) fillets, cold storage thawing, microwave thawing, MNPMT, far-infrared thawing and MNPFT were subjected to red seabream fillets. DSC and dynamic rheology were conducted to analyze physicochemical changes. Raman spectra before and after isotope H/D exchange, intrinsic fluorescence and UV second derivative spectra were carried out to explore myofibrillar protein structural changes. Low-field NMR was used to test water migration. SEM was performed to observe fiber microstructure. Results indicated that MNPMT and MNPFT both had a desirable thermal stability and gelation property. Besides, both showed stable protein secondary and tertiary structure. Immobilized water in them also had no significant changes compared with fresh sample. This research provided some novel thawing technologies for application in food industry.

AB 69 maize germ samples from North China Plain, 40 processed products of maize germs obtained in lab, 30 crude corn oils from factories and 40 refined corn oils from supermarkets in China were analyzed of deoxynivalenol (DON) by HPLC combined with ultraviolet detection and immunoaffinity column. 95.7% of maize germs were contaminated by DON. The average content was 449.0 mu g/kg. The average of DON in processed products of maize germs including solvent extracted oil, cold-press oil, meal and cake was 163.7, 113.1, 1111.5 and 1175.2 mu g/kg, respectively. Only 20% of crude corn oil and 12.5% of refined corn oil were contaminated by DON with the range of 67.5-340.5 mu g/kg and 57.1-207.5 mu g/kg, respectively. During the production of corn oil, solvent extraction oil had a larger amount of DON than pressing oil. The contamination of DON in corn oil was not serious or widespread, which indicated a low risk of health.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first discovered in 1947. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and, in 2015, in the Americas. Since 2013, many countries have reported cases of microcephaly and other central nervous system malformation associated with ZIKV. Because the initial target population for a ZIKV vaccine is expected to be women of child-bearing age, including those who may be pregnant, it is necessary to develop safe, easily administered, and non-viral vaccines. Here, we show that a single tetrafunctional Amphiphilic Block Copolymer (ABC) delivers DNA that encodes the full natural sequence of prM-E, among other antigen designs tested, induces the highest antibody titer and neutralization activity against three divergent ZIKV isolates. Vaccination with a single tetrafunctional block copolymer delivering low dose (10 mu g) DNA plasmid rapidly induces protection from detectable viremia during acute infection in mice challenged by ZIKV more than 7 months after their first vaccination and boosted 2 weeks before challenge. This use of tetrafunctional ABCs is a new approach to deliver DNA antigens against flaviviruses. The data demonstrate that DNA formulated by a tetrafunctional block copolymer rapidly elicits protective responses against multiple diverse ZIKV isolates. This represents potential for an easy-to-administer and simple to manufacture vaccine candidate against ZIKV and possibly other emerging threats to global health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion system protein PopB and its chaperon protein PcrH, when co-administered with the adjuvant curdlan, elicit Th17 responses after intranasal immunization of mice. These PopB/PcrH-curdlan vaccines protect mice against acute lethal pneumonia in an IL-17-dependent fashion involving CD4 helper T cells secreting IL-17 (Th17 cells). In this study, we tested whether encapsulation of PopB/PcrH in poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles could elicit Th17 responses to PopB. Recombinant PopB/PcrH or PcrH alone was encapsulated into PLGA nanoparticles. Mice (FVB/N) were intranasally immunized with the PLGA-PopB/PcrH nanoparticles, PLGA-PcrH nanoparticles, PLGA alone, or PopB/PcrH alone. The protective efficacy was assessed in an acute lung infection model with a lethal dose of an ExoU-producing version of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. Th17 responses were assayed by intracellular flow cytometry and by ELISA for IL-17 in supernatants of splenocytes co-cultured with purified PopB/PcrH. PLGA-PopB/PcrH-immunized mice showed 3-4-fold higher Th17 responses both in the lung and in the spleen compared to mice immunized with empty PLGA or PopB/PcrH alone. After challenge with P. aeruginosa, PLGA-PopB/PcrH-immunized mice showed significantly lower bacterial counts in the lungs and improved survival. In conclusion, encapsulation of PopB/PcrH in PLGA nanoparticles can elicit Th17 responses to intranasal vaccination and protect mice against acute lethal P. aeruginosa pneumonia.

AB African horse sickness is a severe, often fatal, arboviral disease of equids. The control of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) in endemic countries is based currently on the use of live attenuated vaccines despite some biosafety concerns derived from its biological properties. Thus, experimental vaccination platforms have been developed over the years in order to avoid the biosafety concerns associated with the use of attenuated vaccines.
   Various studies showed that baculovirus-expressed AHSV-VP2 or modified Vaccinia Ankara virus expressing AHSV-VP2 (MVA-VP2) induced virus neutralising antibodies and protective immunity in small animals and horses.
   AHSV is an antigenically diverse pathogen and immunity against AHS is serotype-specific. Therefore, AHS vaccines for use in endemic countries need to induce an immune response capable of protecting against all existing serotypes. For this reason, current live attenuated vaccines are administered as polyvalent preparations comprising combinations of AHSV attenuated strains of different serotypes.
   Previous studies have shown that it is possible to induce cross-reactive virus neutralising antibodies against different serotypes of AHSV by using polyvalent vaccines comprising combinations of either different serotype-specific VP2 proteins, or MVA-VP2 viruses. However, these strategies could be difficult to implement if induction of protective immunity is highly dependent on using a two-dose vaccination regime for each serotype the vaccine intends to protect against.
   In our study, we have tested the protective capacity of MVA-VP2 and baculovirus-expressed VP2 vaccines when a single dose was used. Groups of interferon alpha receptor knock-out mice were inoculated with either MVA-VP2 or baculovirus-expressed VP2 vaccines using one dose or the standard two-dose vaccination regime. After vaccination, all four vaccinated groups were challenged with AHSV and clinical responses, lethality and viraemia compared between the groups. Our results show that complete clinical protection was achieved after a single vaccination with either MVA-VP2 or baculovirus sub-unit VP2 vaccines. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: In sub-Saharan Africa, a generation of HIV-1-infected children is approaching the age of sexual debut and becoming at risk for HPV infection and its sequelae. We assessed safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccine in HIV-1-infected adolescents.
   Methods: In an open-label trial among Kenyan, HIV-1-infected adolescents aged 9-14 years, we administered the qHPV vaccine at 0, 2 and 6 months and measured antibody titers to HPV-16, 18, 6 and 11 at month 7 and 12 post-vaccination. Measures of immunogenic response from HIV-1-negative historical cohorts from Africa and HIV-1 positive adolescent cohorts from the USA were used for comparison.
   Results: We enrolled 100 girls and 80 boys with a median age of 12 years and median baseline CD4 cell count of 684 (IQR 478, 935) cells/mu L. One hundred and fifty four (86%) were receiving antiretroviral therapy for a median of 4.5 (IQR 2.3, 6.3) years; 110 (71%) had <400 copies of plasma HIV-1 RNA/mL. Of 189 enrolled children, 179 received all three doses. Two hundred and eighty five (64%) of 445 adverse events were injection site reactions; none were greater than grade 2. Of 6 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), none were considered vaccine related. Seroconversion to HPV-18, 16, 11, 6 at month 7 occurred in 93.3%, 98.3%, 97.2% and 99.6% of vaccine recipients; similar rates have been reported in historical controls. The mean logo HPV antibody titer measured at month 7 increased with each log(10) increase in CD4 by 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.7) for HPV-18; 1.2 (0.9-1.4) for HPV-16; 1.1 (0.8-1.3) for HPV-11; 0.7 (0.5-1.0) for HPV-6 (all p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Almost all Kenyan HIV-1-infected adolescents mounted an immune response comparable to other immunized populations. HPV antibody titers were higher in those with preserved CD4 cell counts. Longer term-follow up will determine sustainability of the immune response. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The number of children entering schools without mandated vaccinations has increased in high-income countries due to the rise of nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements. Herd immunity is threatened when unvaccinated children are concentrated in spatial pockets. Despite the role of vaccine-autism controversy in the current wave of the anti-vaccine movement, we do not know if exemption clusters are associated with local autism rates; it is often assumed that these clusters are merely the result of sociodemographic composition. This study uses data on the number of students with a Personal Belief Exemption reported by schools from 1992 to 2014 and unique data on the locations of children with an autism diagnosis in California to study the correlates of large exemption pockets. Our spatial analysis shows that the prevalence of autism is not associated with the locations of large pockets of vaccination exemptions. Likewise, the spatial distributions of socioeconomic factors and proximity to health care resources have limited roles in explaining these large exemption pockets. Racial/ethnic composition, however, has strong associations with the locations of the large pockets. Our results suggest that community-level interventions are needed to maintain herd immunity as exemption pockets are not merely the result of population composition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) and CVA10 are two of the major pathogens associated with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. The majority of CVA6 and CVA10 infections result in mild, self-limiting episodes (fever and herpangina) in pediatric populations; however, in some cases, can proceed to severe neurological disease and death. Efforts to mitigate viral transmission to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with infection would be greatly strengthened by the availability of an efficacious CVA6 and CVA10 bivalent vaccine. Here we report the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a bivalent combination vaccine comprised of formaldehyde-inactivated, whole-virus CVA6 and CVA10. We demonstrate that subcutaneous delivery of the bivalent vaccine can induce antigen-specific systemic immune responses, particularly the induction of polyfunctional T cells, which elicit active immunization to achieve a protection rate of >80% in the infected neonatal mice. Furthermore, passive transfer of the antisera from vaccinated mice potently protected recipient mice against CVA6 and CVA10 challenge. Importantly, the bivalent vaccine could induce high levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies in adult female mice and the maternal antibody transmitted to the recipient mice played an important role in controlling homotypic and heterotypic CVA6 and CVA10 infections and viral replication in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicate that there is no immunological interference between the two antigens with respect to their ability to induce virus-specific immune responses, and thus provides proof of-concept for further development of multivalent vaccines for broad protection against HFMD.

AB A major challenge in influenza research is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response observed in humans. A workshop organised by the EDUFLUVAC consortium, a European Union funded project coordinated by the European Vaccine Initiative, brought together experts from the influenza vaccine community with the aim to discuss the current knowledge and future perspectives for testing broadly reactive influenza vaccines in animal models. The programme included a diversity of models from well-established and publicly accepted models to cutting edge, newly developed animal models as well as ex-vivo approaches and human models.
   The audience concluded that different vaccine approaches may require evaluation in different animal models, depending on the type of immune response induced by the vaccine. Safety is the main concern for transition to clinical development and influenza vaccine associated enhanced disease was specifically emphasised. An efficient animal model to evaluate this aspect of safety still needs to be identified. Working with animal models requires ethical compliance and consideration of the 3R principles. Development of alternative approaches such as ex-vivo techniques is progressing but is still at an early stage and these methods are not yet suitable for broader application for vaccine evaluation. The human challenge is the ultimate model to assess influenza vaccines. However this model is expensive and not largely applicable. The currently used pre-clinical models are not yet specifically focused on studying unique aspects of a universal influenza vaccine. Further collaboration, communication and effective networking are needed for success in establishment of harmonised and standardised pre-clinical models for evaluation of new influenza vaccines.
   This report does not provide a complete review of the field but discusses the data presented by the speakers and discussion points raised during the meeting.

AB Accidental freezing of aluminum-based vaccines occurs during their storage and transportation, in both developed and developing countries. Freezing damages the freeze-sensitive aluminum adjuvanted vaccines, through separation of lattice between aluminum adjuvant and antigen, leading to formation of aluminum aggregates, and loss of potency. In this study, we examined Alhydrogel (TM) ([AlO(OH)]xnH(2)O, aluminum hydroxide, hydrated for adsorption) stored under recommended conditions, and exposed to freezing temperature until solid-frozen. The main purpose of our research was to determine the destruction areas of the solid-frozen Alhydrogel (TM) using selected methods of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy working in diffraction mode. The Zeta potential evaluation, measurements of albumin adsorption power, thermogravimetric analysis and estimation of the mass loss after drying indicated significant structural (physical) and chemical differences between the freeze damaged and non-frozen vaccine adjuvant. The presented results are important to better understand the type and nature of damages occurring in freeze-damaged aluminum-based vaccines. These results can be used in future studies to improve the temperature stability of aluminum adjuvanted vaccines. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We tested a new A/H1N1 inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) manufactured by Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologics (IVAC), Vietnam in 48 adults in a Phase 1, double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial. Two doses of unadjuvanted vaccine or placebo were administered three weeks apart. The vaccine was well tolerated with only transient mild local reactions and low-grade fever in a small proportion of the subjects. One serious adverse event considered unrelated to the study product was reported. The IVAC vaccine proved to be highly immunogenic with 91 percent (95% CI: 0.78, 1) of the subjects developing a >= 4 fold immune responses by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, and 96 percent (95% CI: 0.78, 1) by the microneutralization (MN) assay. Post-vaccination geometric mean titers (GMTs) were 283.7 (95% CI: 161.7, 497.5) in the HAI and 725.7 (95% CI: 411.3, 1280.3) in the MN assay. These promising results merit further development of the vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Estimation of the magnitude of the herd effect on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is important when evaluating health benefits and cost-effectiveness of paediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) programmes and may influence policy makers' decisions on PCV use. Several epidemiological, programmatic, and immunological factors can affect the magnitude of the PCV herd effect. We investigated to what extent the choice of analytical methodology may also influence herd effect estimates.
   Methods: To estimate the magnitude of the herd effect from paediatric PCV programmes, we examined overall IPD incidence rates in >= 65-year-olds from Finland, Australia, England/Wales, and the United States under different analytical scenarios. We used two different statistical methods: before/after comparison of average IPD incidence rates and interrupted time series (ITS) analysis accounting for underlying time trends. We also investigated how varying the length of the pre- and post-PCV analysis periods influenced the outcomes.
   Results: The estimated impact of paediatric PCV programmes on IPD incidence rates in adults >= 65 years varied substantially across the different scenarios within each country. The choice of statistical method and analysis periods contributed to this variation, and their influence varied by setting. For the datasets from England/Wales and the United States, the different scenarios produced relatively minor variation in estimated impact. For the Australian and Finnish datasets, differences were more prominent. In particular, for Finland, opposite conclusions could be drawn depending on the methodology: while no estimated herd effect was seen with the before/after method, a herd effect was evident with the ITS method.
   Conclusions: The choice of statistical method and analysis periods can substantially influence the magnitude of estimated herd effects from paediatric PCV programmes. It is important to consider the reliability and presence of pre-PCV patterns in the IPD surveillance data used for analysis, the methodology and associated assumptions used to estimate herd effects.

AB A ferret challenge study was conducted to address the efficacy of the egg-based and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-based live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) strains. Vaccines derived as 6:2 reassortants from the A/Leningrad/134/17/57 master donor strain and the HA and NA components from the A/California/07/2009 (A/Cal)- and A/Michigan/45/2015 (A/Mich)-like strains of type A H1N1 influenza virus were used in the study. Monovalent, trivalent and quadrivalent formulations of the LAIV containing either of the two H1N1 strains were analysed. A total of ten groups of six animals each were immunised intranasally (i.n.) with a single dose of 0.5-ml vaccine formulation or placebo and challenged on day 28 with the homologous wild-type A/Cal or A/Mich strain. Immune response post immunisation and virus replication post challenge were studied.
   Both the strains derived from embryonated eggs or MDCK cells, irrespective of the vaccine valency, were capable of rendering complete protection from virus replication in the lung. The A/Mich vaccine strain showed higher immune titres and efficacy than the A/Cal vaccine strain in all the vaccine formulations. The haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralisation antibody titres were induced, and the reduction in the virus load in the respiratory tract was observed to be higher in animals treated with the monovalent formulation compared to the trivalent and quadrivalent formulations. Overall, it appears that the monovalent formulations render better protection from infection and would therefore be the best candidate during a pandemic. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: A unique population of Nigerian children, aged 1-5 years, never receive any of the recommended childhood vaccines. However, the characteristics of this population has not been previously described. Given Nigeria's historically poor childhood immunization coverage and high child mortality rates, it was imperative we investigate the prevalence and correlates of never-vacccination among Nigerian children.
   Methods: We conducted secondary analysis of the 2013 Nigeria Demographic Health Survey data of Nigerian children, aged 12-59 months (n = 20,586). Weighted multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between socio-demographic factors and never-vaccination of Nigerian children. Further regression analysis was conducted after stratifying by Northern and Southern regions.
   Results: About twenty one percent of study sample, had never been vaccinated. Over eighty percent of the never-vaccinated children in our study resided in the Northern geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Child never-vaccination was found to be significantly associated with key socio-demographic characteristics. Children born into poor households, with mothers who are unemployed and uneducation, were more likely to be never-vaccinated. Unique predictors of child never-vaccination specific to Northern Nigeria were identified. Islam (aOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.11-2.17) and lack of access to Television or Radio (aOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.22-1.81) promoted never-vaccination, while increasing maternal age and rural residence (aOR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.42-0.95) were associated with lower odds of never-vaccination.
   Conclusion: Socio-demographic factors are predictors of child never-vaccination in Nigeria. Further investigations are needed to better understand the underlying contexts that conribute to child never vaccination in populations identified in this study. More so, it is important to examine the mechanism through which predictors that are region-speific, culminate in child never-vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) play a central role in polio eradication efforts. Armed conflicts resulting in insecurity negatively affect SIAs. In the Southwest region of Cameroon, armed conflicts persisted in 2018. We present our experiences of conducting a polio SIA in an insecure region.
   Methods: The SIA took place from the 2nd to 4th of March 2018 and targeted 307,920 children aged 0-59 months. Bivalent polio vaccine was used. Before the SIA, extensive planning was done under the leadership of a Central Technical Group. Planning included security assessment, advocacy and social mobilisation.
   Results: Only 4 of the 18 health districts (HDs) of the Southwest region were considered safe. Regardless, vaccination teams worked in all HDs. The SIA achieved a coverage of 89.9%. Town criers and social mobilisers were the main sources of information about the SIA. Most (76%) children were vaccinated using the door to door strategy. There was no case of vaccine refusal.
   Conclusion: Community members were very receptive of the SIA and this may be due to the communication that was adopted. Strong dedication by vaccination teams, community members' understanding and acceptance of polio SIAs are all key factors to the eradication of polio in conflict zones. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Group A streptococcus (GAS) causes an exceptionally diverse range of diseases, raising questions about the optimal product characteristics of a commercially viable vaccine. The objectives of this study were to (1) estimate the current health and economic burdens caused by 24 diseases attributable to GAS each year in Australia and (2) use these estimates to explore the value of a GAS vaccine for different clinical indications, age schedules, and population groups.
   Methods: For objective 1, we estimated the population heath and economic burdens by synthesising data from administrative databases, nationally representative surveys, literature reviews, public reimbursement schedules, and expert opinion. For objective 2, we modelled the prospective lifetime burden of GAS for all infants from birth, for children from 5 years of age, and for adults from 65 years of age. A vaccine was assumed to reduce each GAS disease by 70% for a period of 10 years, and the difference in outcomes between vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohorts were used to calculate the cost-effective value of vaccination.
   Results: The annual health and economic burdens of GAS diseases totalled 23,528 disability-adjusted life years and AU$185.1 million in healthcare costs respectively; approximately half of each measure was due to cellulitis, followed by other skin infections and throat infections. Reducing the incidence of throat infections, skin infections, and cellulitis in non-Indigenous cohorts resulted in 30%, 33%, and 28% of the total vaccine value for an infant schedule (cost-effective vaccine price AU$260 per course); 47%, 26%, and 22% of the value for a child schedule (AU$289); and 2%, 15% and 74% for an adult schedule (AU$489).
   Conclusions: A vaccine that prevents GAS cellulitis and other skin infections, in addition to throat infections, would maximise its value and commercial viability, with a cost-effective price in line with other recently-licensed and funded vaccines in Australia.

AB Background: The World Health Organization recommends the development of affordable next-generation inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV) using attenuated poliovirus Sabin strains. Previously, we introduced a novel PER.C6 (R) cell culture platform, which allows for high yield production of an affordable trivalent Sabin IPV vaccine.
   Methods: Immunogenicity and safety of this novel PER.C6 (R)-based Sabin-IPV (sIPV) was assessed in rats and non-human primates (NHPs). NHPs received one of four different dose dilutions vaccine according to current human schedule (three prime-immunizations and one boost immunization). For comparison, NHPs received commercially available reference Salk IPV or sIPV.
   Results: Dose-dependent immunogenicity and good tolerability was observed for the PER.C6 (R)-based sIPV formulations in rats and NHPs. In NHPs, the lowest tested dose that induced anti-Sabin virus-neutralizing antibody titers that were non-inferior to commercial sIPV after three immunizations was 5-7.5-25 D-antigen units for type 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
   Discussion: PER.C6 (R)-based sIPV induced comparable immunogenicity to commercial Salk IPV and sIPV vaccines in NHPs. Together with the absence of any preclinical safety signals, these data warrant further testing in clinical trials. sIPV produced on the PER.C6 (R) cell platform could be one solution to the need for an affordable and immunogenic IPV to achieve and maintain global polio eradication.

AB Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most important cause of severe respiratory illness in infants. There is no effective vaccine and the only effective treatment available is the monoclonal antibody palivizumab which reduces the risk of severe RSV disease in prematurely born infants. However, palivizumab is too costly to allow for wide implementation and thus treatment is restricted to supportive care. Despite extensive efforts to develop a vaccine, progress has been hindered by the difficulty in measuring and assessing immunological correlates of RSV vaccine efficacy in the presence of high levels of pre-existing RSV antibodies.
   Methods: Here we describe a new method for measuring the functional activity of antibodies induced by vaccination distinct from pre-existing antibodies. Antibodies in lymphocyte supernatants (ALS) from the cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of young adults who had recently been vaccinated with a novel RSV candidate vaccine were directly assayed for virus neutralising activity. An ELISA method was used to measure antibodies in nasal and serum samples and then compared with the adapted ALS based method.
   Results: There was a wide background distribution of RSV-specific antibodies in serum and nasal samples that obscured vaccine-specific responses measured two weeks after vaccination. No RSV-specific antibodies were observed at baseline in ALS samples, but a clear vaccine-specific antibody response was observed in ALS seven days after the administration of each dose of vaccine. These vaccine-specific antibodies in ALS displayed functional activity in vitro, and quantification of this functional activity was unperturbed by pre-existing antibodies from natural exposure. The results demonstrate a promising new approach for assessing functional immune responses attributed to RSV vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: An adverse reaction associated with vaccination is considered to be a key barrier to vaccinate, yet little attention has been given to interventions to reduce their occurrence. Exercise is a behavioural adjuvant which may also influence adverse reactions. Here, two randomized controlled trials are reported, examining the effects of exercise on self-reported adverse reactions following vaccination in adolescents and young adults.
   Methods: Study one; 116 adolescents receiving the HPV vaccine were randomly allocated to either Control (n = 56) or Pre-vaccine Exercise (n = 60) group (2015-2016). Exercise consisted of 15-minutes upper body exercise. Study two; 78 young adults receiving the influenza vaccine were randomly allocated to either Control (n = 19), or one of 3 exercise groups: Pre-vaccine Arm (n = 19), Pre-vaccine Leg (n = 20) or Post vaccine Arm (n = 20) (2017). Exercise included 15-minutes of arm or leg exercises prior to or after vaccination. All participants in both studies completed an adverse events diary for seven-days post-vaccination.
   Results: Study one; Reported days of tenderness in female adolescents that exercised were significantly lower than control (p = 0.032), with a similar trend in reported days of pain (p = 0.050). Furthermore, days of feeling ill (p = 0.070) and reduced appetite (p = 0.067) were found to be lower with exercise, although not significant. Overall, female adolescents reported significantly more days of pain (p = 0.003), tenderness (p < 0.001), swelling (p = 0.011), and feeling ill (p = 0.0040). Study two; Exercise groups reported reduced days of swelling (p = 0.018), fever (p = 0.013), and lowered appetite (p = 0.011) across both genders. Furthermore, females reported reduced days of medication use with exercise (p = 0.034), and a trend toward reduced days of swelling (p = 0.052).
   Discussion: In two separate trials, a short bout of exercise reduced reported adverse reactions after vaccinations for local and systemic adverse reactions. Gender differences in reported local and systemic adverse reactions were more evident among adolescents than young adults. These findings support the need for further work to examine the potential benefit of exercise in improving vaccination procedures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and non-replicating adenoviral vectors can induce expanded, sustained effector memory CD8(+)T-cell responses, termed "memory inflation". During murine CMV (MCMV) infection, CD4(+) Tcells maintain inflationary virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses via IL-2 but not IL-21. Adenovirus vector vaccination can induce phenotypically, functionally and transcriptionally similar inflationary responses, but it is not known how IL-21 influences the inflating memory response to adenoviral vaccination. Here, we show that IL-21 is an absolute requirement for induction and maintenance of vaccine-derived inflationary CD8(+) T-cell responses. These data indicate that the induction pathway of inflationary Ad-LacZ T-cells is distinct from inflationary MCMV-specific T-cells and is highly dependent on IL-21. Our observations highlight a fundamental difference in the mechanism by which adenovirus vectors and MCMV drive inflationary T-cell responses. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Limited data is available on the use of different HPV vaccines in the same subjects. We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of a mixed vaccination schedule with one dose of nonavalent (9vHPV) and one dose of bivalent vaccine (2vHPV) administered in different order versus two doses of 9vHPV vaccine.
   Methods: 371 girls and boys aged 9-10 years were randomized (1:1) to receive (I) two doses of 9vHPV or (II) a mixed schedule of 2vHPV + 9vHPV or 9vHPV + 2vHPV with a 6 month interval. Antibodies to HPV were tested by ELISA in blood samples collected one or six months post-first dose and one month post-second dose.
   Results: Post-first dose of 9vHPV 99.4-100% of subjects were seropositive to 9 HPV types included in the vaccine. GMTs varied from 5.0 to 73.6 IU(AU)/ml depending on HPV type. Post-first dose of 2vHPV all subjects were seropositive to HPV16 and 18 (GMTs 16.7 and 11.7 IU/ml, respectively) and 50.0-76.7% were seropositive to 7 types not included in 2vHPV (GMTs varied from 0.3 to 17.5 AU/ml depending on type). Post-second dose all subjects, regardless of the study group, were seropositive to 9 HPV types included in 9vHPV. Anti-HPV16 and 18 GMTs were higher in subjects with the mixed schedule and for the other 7 HPV types higher in subjects who received two doses of 9vHPV vaccine. A higher proportion of subjects who received 2vHPV reported local or systemic adverse events than those who received 9vHPV as the first dose. Post-second dose there were no differences in reported adverse events between the two vaccines.
   Conclusions: The results show the mixed HPV vaccination schedules used in this study are immunogenic and have an acceptable safety profile. Although the seroprotective threshold of antibodies remains unknown the 100% seropositivity to all 9 HPV types included in 9vHPV and the increase of GMTs observed in all study groups post-second dose administration are reassuring and suggest protection might be achieved regardless of the schedule used.

AB Background: There is a considerable global burden of invasive group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. Vaccines are being developed for use in pregnant women to offer protection to neonates. Objective: To estimate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of maternal immunisation against neonatal and maternal invasive GBS disease in the UK.
   Methods: We developed a decision-tree model encompassing GBS-related events in infants and mothers, following a birth cohort with a time horizon equivalent to average life expectancy (81 years). We parameterised the model using contemporary data from disease surveillance and outcomes in GBS survivors. Costs were taken from NHS sources and research studies. Maternal immunisation in combination with risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) was compared to the current standard practice of risk-based IAP alone from an NHS and Personal Social Services (health-provider) perspective. We estimated the cases averted and cost per QALY gained through vaccination. One-way sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed.
   Results: An effective maternal immunisation programme could substantially reduce the burden of GBS disease. The deterministic analysis estimated the threshold cost-effective price for a GBS vaccine to be 54 pound per dose at 20,000 pound/QALY (71 pound per dose at 30,000 pound/QALY). Results were most sensitive to assumptions on disease incidence, sequelae rate and vaccine efficacy. Probabilistic analysis showed 90.66% of iterations fell under the 30,000 pound threshold at a vaccine price of 55 pound. Inclusion of modest prevention of stillbirths and/or, preterm births, carer health impacts, maternal GBS deaths and 1.5% discounting improved cost-effectiveness compared to the base case. Lowering vaccine strain coverage made the vaccine less cost-effective. A key limitation is that the properties of the final GBS vaccine are unknown.
   Conclusions: Maternal GBS immunisation is expected to be cost-effective, even at a relatively high vaccine price. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: A monovalent rotavirus vaccine was introduced in the Ethiopian Expanded Program on Immunization from November 2013. We compared impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction on rotavirus associated acute diarrhea hospitalizations and genotypic characteristics of rotavirus strains pre-and post-vaccine introduction.
   Methods: Sentinel surveillance for diarrhea among children <5 years of age was conducted at 3 hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 2011 to 2017. Stool specimens were collected from enrolled children and tested using an antigen capture enzyme immunoassay. Rotavirus positive samples (156 from pre- and 141 from post-vaccination periods) were further characterized by rotavirus genotyping methods to identify the predominant G and P types circulating during the surveillance era.
   Results: A total of 788 children were enrolled during the pre- (July 2011-June 2013) and 815 children during the post-vaccination (July 2014-June 2017) periods. The proportion of diarrhea hospitalizations due to rotavirus among children <5 years of age declined by 17% from 24% (188/788) in the pre-vaccine period and to 20% (161/185) in post-vaccine introduction era. Similarly, a reduction of 18% in proportion of diarrhea hospitalizations due to rotavirus in children <12 months of age in the post (27%) vs pre-vaccine (33%) periods was observed. Seasonal peaks of rotavirus declined following rotavirus vaccine introduction. The most prevalent circulating strains were G12P[8] in 2011 (36%) and in 2012 (27%), G2P[4] (35%) in 2013, G9P[8] (19%) in 2014, G3P[6] and G2P[4] (19% each) in 2015, and G3P[8] (29%) in 2016.
   Discussion: Following rotavirus vaccine introduction in Ethiopia, a reduction in rotavirus associated hospitalizations was seen in all age groups with the greatest burden in children <12 months of age. A wide variety of rotavirus strains circulated in the pre- and post-vaccine introduction periods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Maternal vaccines against pertussis are not yet recommended in the developing world. Besides unclear burden estimates, another concern is that transplacental transfer of maternal pertussis antibodies could result in attenuation of the immune response to whole cell pertussis (DTwP) primary vaccination series in infants. This study was taken up to determine whether higher levels of maternal pertussis antibodies attenuate immune response of infants to DTwP vaccination series given at 6-10-14 weeks of age.
   Methodology: A total of 261 pregnant women and their infants from four low-income settlements in Karachi, Pakistan were enrolled in this study. The study endpoints were infant antibody titers for Pertussis toxin (PTx), Filamentous hemagglutinin antigen (FHA), Pertactin (PRN) and Fimbriae type 2/3 (FIM) - from birth through 18 weeks of age. Cord blood or pre-vaccine pertussis antibody titers indicate the concentration of maternal antibodies transferred to infants. Linear regression models were used to determine the association between higher maternal antibody titers and infant immune response to DTwP vaccine. Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) was calculated as the ratio of infant antibody titers at specified time points against the maternal antibody titers at the time of delivery.
   Results: At eighteen weeks of age, the adjusted beta regression coefficient for PTx was 0.06 (95% CI: -0.49-0.61), FHA 0.02 (95% CI: -0.26 -0.29), PRN 0.02 (95%CI -038- 0.43), and FIM 0.17 (95%CI: -0.21-0.54). Among infants who received at least two doses of DTwP vaccine, higher maternal antibody titers did not have any attenuating effect on infant post-immunization antibody titers against all four pertussis antigens.
   Conclusion: Maternal pertussis antibodies did not attenuate infant's immune response to pertussis antigens in DTwP primary vaccine given at 6-10-14 weeks of age. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: During an influenza epidemic, where early vaccination is crucial, pharmacies may be a resource to increase vaccine distribution reach and capacity.
   Methods: We utilized an agent-based model of the US and a clinical and economics outcomes model to simulate the impact of different influenza epidemics and the impact of utilizing pharmacies in addition to traditional (hospitals, clinic physician offices, and urgent care centers) locations for vaccination for the year 2017.
   Results: For an epidemic with a reproductive rate (R0) of 1.30, adding pharmacies with typical business hours averted 11.9 million symptomatic influenza cases, 23,577 to 94,307 deaths, $1.0 billion in direct (vaccine administration and healthcare) costs, $4.2-44.4 billion in productivity losses, and $5.2-45.3 billion in overall costs (varying with mortality rate). Increasing the epidemic severity (R0 of 1.63), averted 16.0 million symptomatic influenza cases, 35,407 to 141,625 deaths, $1.9 billion in direct costs, $6.0-65.5 billion in productivity losses, and $7.8-67.3 billion in overall costs (varying with mortality rate). Extending pharmacy hours averted up to 16.5 million symptomatic influenza cases, 145,278 deaths, $1.9 billion direct costs, $4.1 billion in productivity loss, and $69.5 billion in overall costs. Adding pharmacies resulted in a cost-benefit of $4.1 to $11.5 billion, varying epidemic severity, mortality rate, pharmacy hours, location vaccination rate, and delay in the availability of the vaccine.
   Conclusions: Administering vaccines through pharmacies in addition to traditional locations in the event of an epidemic can increase vaccination coverage, mitigating up to 23.7 million symptomatic influenza cases, providing cost-savings up to $2.8 billion to third-party payers and $99.8 billion to society. Pharmacies should be considered as points of dispensing epidemic vaccines in addition to traditional settings as soon as vaccines become available. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Varicella and herpes zoster (HZ), diseases both caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), are vaccine-preventable. However, the hypothesis that childhood varicella vaccination may increase the incidence of HZ hinders varicella universal routine vaccination (URV) implementation in many countries.
   Methods: This non-systematic and narrative review of the literature considers the burden of varicella and HZ, and the effectiveness of the respective vaccines. We present the factors involved in the interplay between varicella vaccination and HZ incidence, including the roles of exogenous and endogenous boosting. We review HZ incidence model predictions, and compare these with real-world evidence, which has accumulated since varicella URV was introduced.
   Conclusion: Although more research and longer surveillance are needed, available real-world evidence has not confirmed the model-predicted increase in HZ incidence, associated with childhood varicella URV. Although there is a rising incidence of HZ globally, this trend appears to be predominantly the result of an aging population. Vaccination against varicella in childhood provides significant benefits with respect to the medical, societal and economic burdens of the disease. Therefore, a theoretical concern of an increased burden of HZ with varicella vaccination programs should not prevent children from being protected against the disease.

AB VSV-EBOV is a replication-competent Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine, which was tested in clinical trials as response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak 2013-2016. It is the most advanced EBOV candidate currently in the licensure process. The experimental vaccine was again administered as response to outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, underlying molecular mechanisms that convey protection remain incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known key regulators that influence gene expression on a post-transcriptional level. The miRNA-mediated control has emerged as a critical regulatory principle in the immune system, which strongly influences the balance of innate and adaptive immune responses by modulation of signaling pathways critical for differentiation of immune cells. We investigated expression levels of circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) in plasma from healthy vaccinees, as they may reflect cellular dynamics following VSV-EBOV immunization and additionally may serve as potential biomarkers for vaccine efficacy.
   As part of the WHO-led VEBCON consortium, we investigated safety and immunogenicity of VSV-EBOV in a phase I trial. A comprehensive analysis of expression levels on c-miRNAs from plasma samples following VSV-EBOV immunization (day 0, 1, 3 post vaccination) was conducted using RT-qPCR assays. Potential biological relevance was assessed using in silico analyses. Additionally, we correlated dynamics of miRNA expressions with our previously reported data on vaccine-induced antibody and cytokine responses and finally evaluated the prognostic power by generating ROC curves.
   We identified four promising miRNAs (hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-199a, hsa-miR-484), showing a strong association with adaptive immune responses, exhibited favourable prognostic performance and are implicated in immunology-related functions.
   Our results provide evidence that miRNAs may serve as useful biomarkers for prediction of vaccine induced immunogenicity. Furthermore, our unique data set provides insight into molecular mechanisms that underlie VSV-EBOV-mediated protective immune responses, which may help to decipher VSV-EBOV immune signature and accelerate strategic vaccine design or personalized approaches.

AB Background: Herpes zoster (shingles) is a common viral disease increasing in risk and severity with age. Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complication of shingles, causes severe pain impacting quality of life (QoL). Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL), a licensed vaccine for the prevention of shingles in the United Kingdom (UK), is part of the national immunisation programme (NIP) for adults aged 70-79. Public Health England (PHE) reports show shingles vaccine coverage varies, but is typically 50-60% across eligible cohorts.
   Materials/methods: This retrospective, matched cohort study was conducted using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) UK primary care database. Individuals aged 70-79 were classified based on their vaccination status between September 2013 and May 2016. Risk and incidence rates for shingles were calculated for both groups over the duration of the study (mean 1.2 years). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated using the equation 1-relative risk (RR) for shingles and PHN.
   Results: Within the total cohort (n = 295,135), 70,867 (24%) were vaccinated and 224,268 (76%) were unvaccinated. 2435 (0.83%) patients developed shingles: 241 (0.34%) among the vaccinated and 2194 (0.98%) among the unvaccinated. The VE for preventing shingles was 65.3% (95% CI: 60.3-69.6%). The incidence rate in the vaccinated group was 2.95 (95% CI: 2.59-3.34) vs 8.02 (95% CI: 7.68-8.36) per 1000 person years in the unvaccinated group. Risk of PHN was 0.02% and 0.06% in the respective vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The VE for preventing PHN was 72% (95% CI: 50.0-83.9%). PHN incidence rates were 0.16 (95% CI: 0.08-0.27) and 0.53 (95% CI: 0.44-0.62) per 1000 person years in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, respectively.
   Conclusions: ZVL reduced the risk of shingles among an elderly population. Given the negative impact of shingles and PHN on QoL, the benefits of vaccination are clear. Improving uptake in the UK is needed in this population. (C) 2018 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., and The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccines effectively prevent infectious diseases. Many types of vaccines against various pathogens that threaten humans are currently in widespread use. Recently, adjuvant adaptation has been attempted to activate innate immunity to enhance the effectiveness of vaccines. The effectiveness of adjuvants for vaccinations has been demonstrated in many animal models and clinical trials. Although a highly potent adjuvant tends to have high effectiveness, it also has the potential to increase the risk of side effects such as pain, edema, and fever. Indeed, highly effective adjuvants, such as poly(I:C), have not been clinically applied due to their high risks of toxicity in humans. Therefore, the task in the field of adjuvant development is to clinically apply highly effective and non-or low-toxic adjuvant-containing vaccines. To resolve this issue, it is essential to ensure a low risk of side effects and the high efficacy of an adjuvant in the early developmental phases. This review summarizes the theory and history of the current safety assessment methods for adjuvants, using the inactivated influenza vaccine as a model. Our novel method was developed as a system to judge the safety of a candidate compound using biomarkers identified by genomic technology and statistical tools. A systematic safety assessment tool for adjuvants would be of great use for predicting toxicity during novel adjuvant development, screening, and quality control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Three alkaline treatments (pH 10, 11, and 12 for 1 h) were used to treat return sludge alone to reduce sludge production in laboratory-scale anaerobic-anoxic-oxic processes. After 99 days of operation, alkaline treatments at pH 10 and 11 led to accumulative excess sludge production and sludge yield reduction of 18.8%-31.7% and 14.7%-27.8%, respectively. However, alkaline treatment at pH 12 led to system breakdown because of sludge bulking. The alkaline treatment at pH 10 did not affect the chemical oxygen demand and NH4(+)-N removals of the system and sludge volume index (SVI) of aerobic activated sludge. However, alkaline treatments at pH 11 and 12 obviously deteriorated the wastewater treatment efficiencies and sludge SVI. Although the three treatments increased the effluent pH by 0.08 to 0.38, the effluent pH of three systems were all lower than 9.00. The treatments at pH 10 and 11 increased the specific oxygen uptake rate of activated sludge, whereas the treatment at pH 12 decreased this rate.

AB Collagen and calcium-binding EGF domain-1 (CCBE1) is a secreted protein critical for lymphatic/cardiac vascular development and regeneration. However, the low efficient production of the recombinant full-length CCBE1 (rCCBE1) has been a setback for functional studies and therapeutic applications using this protein.
   The main goal of this work was to implement a robust bioprocess for efficient production of glycosylated rCCBE1. Different bioprocess strategies were combined with proteomic tools for process/product characterization, evaluating the impact of process parameters on cell performance, rCCBE1 production and quality.
   We have shown that rCCBE1 volumetric yield was positively correlated with higher cell density at transfection (HDT), and under these conditions the secreted protein presented a mature glycosylated profile (complex N-glycans). Mild hypothermia was also applied to HDT condition that resulted in enhanced cell viability; however an enrichment of immature rCCBE1 variants was detected. Mass spectrometry-based tools allowed the identification of rCCBE1 peptides confirming protein identity in the affinity chromatography enriched product rCCBE1 biological activity was validated by in vitro angiogenesis assay, where enhanced vessel formation was observed.
   Herein, we report a step forward in the production and characterization of human glycosylated rCCBE1, amenable for in vitro and in vivo studies to explore its regenerative therapeutic potential.

AB The present study describes the formulation of a biosurfactant produced by Bacillus methylotrophicus UCP1616 and investigates its long-term stability for application as a collector in a bench-scale dissolved air flotation (DAF) prototype. For formulation, the conservative potassium sorbate was added to the biosurfactant with or without prior heat treatment at 80 degrees C for 30 min. After formulation, the biosurfactant samples were stored at room temperature for 180 days and the tensioactive properties of the biomolecule were determined with different pH values, temperatures and concentrations of salt. Then, a central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the influence of the independent variables (effluent flow rate and formulated biosurfactant flow rate) on the oil removal efficiency in the DAF prototype. The formulated biosurfactant demonstrated good stability in both conservation methods, with tolerance to a wide pH range, salinity and high temperatures, enabling its use in environments with extreme conditions. The efficiency of the formulated biomolecule through heating and addition of sorbate was demonstrated by the 92% oil removal rate in the DAF prototype. The findings demonstrate that the biosurfactant from Bacillus methylotrophicus enhances the efficiency of the DAF process, making this technology cleaner. This biosurfactant can assist in the mitigation and management of industrial effluents, contributing toward a reduction in environmental pollution caused by petroleum-based hydrocarbons.

AB Feed supplements are concentrated cell culture media that contain a variety of nutrients, which can be added during a bioprocess. During fed-batch cultivation, feed media are typically added to a growing cell culture to maximize cell and product concentrations. In this study, only a single shot of feed medium was added on day 0 to a basal cell culture medium and compared to non-supplemented basal medium (feed-spiked at day 0 versus control experiments) by cultivation of a recombinant mAb expressing CHO cell line in batch mode under controlled conditions in a bioreactor. Since the feed-spike at day 0 was based on existing medium components without introducing additional supplements, a desirable process with decreased complexity was generated. Unlike cells in basal medium, feed-spiked cultures reached almost 2 x higher peak cell concentrations (10 x 10(6) c/mL vs. 18 x 10(6) c/mL) and 3 x higher antibody concentrations (0.8 g/L vs. 2.4 g/L). Batch process time and the integral over the viable cell count were similar for both process types. Constantly high cell-specific production rates in feed-spiked cultures (70 pg/cell/day) compared to continuously declining rates in basal medium (from 70 to 10 pg/cell/day) were responsible for an overall 70% higher cell-specific production rate and the higher product concentrations. To associate gene expression patterns to different process proceedings, transcriptome analysis was performed using microarrays. Several transcripts that are involved with glutamine de novo synthesis and citric acid cycle were significantly upregulated on several days in feed-spiked cultures. The top identified gene ontology (GO) terms related well to cell cycle and primary metabolism, cellular division as well as nucleobase formation or regulation, which indicated a more active proliferative state for feed-spiked cultures. KEGG biochemical pathway analysis and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further confirmed these findings from a complementary perspective. Moreover, several interesting gene targets, which have not yet been associated with recombinant protein expression, were identified that related to a higher proliferative state, growth, protein synthesis, cell-size control, metabolism, cell survival as well as genes that are associated with the control of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in feed-spiked cultures. Analysis of critical product quality attributes (i.e. glycosylation, charge variants and size distribution) showed that feed-spiking did not change antibody quality.

AB Halophilic microorganisms have great potentials towards biotechnological applications. Halomonas hydrothermalis Y2 is a halotolerant and alkaliphilic strain that isolated from the Na+-rich pulp mill wastewater. The strain is dominant in the bacterial community of pulp mill wastewater and exhibits metabolic diversity in utilizing various substrates. Here we present the genome sequence of this strain, which comprises a circular chromosome 3,933,432 bp in size and a GC content of 60.2%. Diverse genes that encoding proteins for compatible solutes synthesis and transport were identified from the genome. With a complete pathway for ectoine synthesis, the strain could produce ectoine from monosodium glutamate and further partially secreted into the medium. In addition, around 20% ectoine was increased by deleting the ectoine hydroxylase (EctD). The genome sequence we report here will provide genetic information regarding adaptive mechanisms of strain Y2 to its harsh habitat, as well as facilitate exploration of metabolic strategies for diverse compatible solutes, e.g., ectoine production.

AB Bacteria from the Bacillus group are microorganisms that inhabit a large number of different habitats. They are well known as producers of a wide array of antagonistic compounds of different structures, having between 5 to 8% of the total genome devoted to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Most important bioactive molecules from the genus Bacillus are non-ribosomally synthesized peptides and lipopeptides, polyketide compounds, bacteriocins and siderophores. Lipopeptides from Bacillus have very complex mechanisms of biosynthesis catalyzed by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), large enzyme complexes with modular structure, with each module being in charge for the incorporation of a particular amino acid. In general, they have a broad spectrum of antagonistic activity against plant pathogenic bacteria, fungi and viruses. Most important molecules from this group, circular lipopeptides from surfactin, iturin and fengycin families affect the target cells on the membrane level. Bacillus strains exhibit their biocontrol capacity predominantly through inhibitory activity on the growth of plant pathogens, as well as inducing systemic resistance in plants and competing for ecological niches with plant pathogens. Our previous studies showed the presence of multiple biosynthetic operons for synthesis of non-ribosomal lipopeptides in the collection of natural isolates of Bacillus, with many strains having more than one of them. Several strains of Bacillus sp. that we have recently characterized showed very strong antibacterial and antifungal activity against phytopathogens. The PCR analysis showed the presence of biosynthetic operons for iturin, bacillomycin, fengycin and surfactin in tested strains. Measurement of the kinetics of production of antimicrobial substances showed that, in most cases, synthesis started at the beginning of exponential phase of growth, reaching the maximum of antimicrobial activity at the beginning of the stationary growth phase and stayed at this level for the whole duration of observed period. Preparations of cell-free supernatants of tested strains were active against many fungal and bacterial pathogens, in vitro and in vivo. Mass spectrometry and HPTLC bioautography analysis of purified compounds confirmed the presence of lipopeptides of mentioned families, hence confirming the biocontrol capacity of Bacillus isolates.

AB Effect of particle size (85 mu m vs. 50 mu m) on the performance of continuous capture chromatography using Protein A affinity was evaluated in combination with varied feed titers, loading flow rates and target breakthrough using a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach. In comparison to previous studies, higher cell culture titers on the order of 5-15 g/L, relevant to current high productivity industrial cell lines, were evaluated. Further, three modes of capture continuous chromatography were included in the DoE: single column batch, 2-column CaptureSMB and 4-column periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC). The breakthrough percentage at the outlet of the first column being loaded showed the most significant impact on process performance, confirming the advantage of multi-column over batch chromatography processes. Out of the two resins, the one with smaller particle size displayed significantly better performance. To verify and generalize these results, a shrinking core model for protein A chromatography has been developed and validated. The model was used to optimize the processes with respect to capacity utilization (load per cycle) and productivity (load per time). The smaller particle size resin (50 mu m) produced steeper breakthrough curves and allowed for better capacity utilization at any given productivity value. The improvement in loading was around 15% on average in comparison to the 85 mu m bead size in spite of the ligand density being same. The 50 mu m resin also allowed for higher maximum productivity values compared to the 85 mu m resin (improvements of 25-50%, depending on the process), despite lower maximum flow rate due to increased pressure drop. In addition, it is worth noting that recovery and regeneration rather than the maximum flow rate (pressure drop) became the limiting factor for process optimization in almost all considered scenarios.

AB Citrus huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating disease associated with Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus spp. (CLas), a bacterium restricted to the sieve tube system of the phloem that is transmitted by the psyllid vector, Diaphorina citri. In this study, the human antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme and beta-defensin 2, were targeted to the vascular tissue of Mexican lime (Citrus x aurantifolia [Christm.] Swingle) by fusion to a phloem-restricted protein. Localized expression was achieved, via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of the stem, which led to protein expression and mobilization within the vascular tissue of heterotrophic tissues. HLB-infected plants were monitored for 360 days. Lower bacteria titers were observed in plants expressing either beta-defensin 2, lysozyme, or the combination thereof, and these plants had increased photosynthesis, compared to untreated control trees. Thus, targeting of antimicrobial proteins to the vascular tissue was effective in decreasing CLas titer, and alleviating citrus greening symptoms. Based on these findings, this strategy could be used to effectively treat plants that are already infected with bacterial pathogens that reside in the phloem translocation stream.

AB The decolourization and detoxification of azo dyes (Orange 2, Acid Orange 6) by fungal laccase from Trametes versicolor were evaluated. For laccase catalysed reaction, the azonaphthol Orange 2, with 72.8% decolourization, was degraded more rapidly than the azobenzene Acid Orange 6, with 45.3%. The presence of hydroxyl group at o-position to azo bond in the structure of Orange 2 was more preferable than the presence of two hydroxyl groups at o- and p-positions to azo bond in Acid Orange 6. Although the laccase treatment was more effective for the Orange 2 decolourization, the toxicity of both monoazo dye solutions became less toxic for the prokaryote growth. The phytotoxicity of Orange 2 and Acid Orange 6 solutions after laccase treatment was decreased in the range of 41.2-64.3 %. Also, the photoxicity, as measured by the production of chlorophylls a and b by Chlorella vulgaris and Microcystis aeruginosa, was decreased by laccase treatment of selected monoazo dyes. Our results show that different dyes can be decolorized and detoxified by laccase from T. versicolor in a single step.

AB Vitamin D is essential for bone health and has significant roles in non-skeletal health and organ function. Dermal synthesis through exposure to ultraviolet B light is the major natural source of vitamin D, while only a small portion of the necessary amount can be acquired by a diet without fortified foods. In recent years, vitamin D deficiency as a result of lifestyles with inadequate sun exposure, has received increased attention due to its association with the increased risk of serious chronic diseases. This review summarizes our current understanding of food fortification strategies with vitamin D and the resulting health impact. Conventional and biotechnological approaches can be used for the production of new and novel vitamin D rich or vitamin D fortified foods. The availability of a wider range of every-day consumed fortified foods as part of a "Daily D" public health policy can contribute to the improvement of vitamin D status and to prevention of vitamin D deficiency.

AB Cellulose hydrolysis is a synergetic process performed sequentially by different cellulolytic enzymes including endoglucanases, exoglucanases and glucosidases. Trichoderma reesei has been acknowledged as the best cellulase producer, but cellulase production by T. reesei through submerged fermentation is costly due to intensive energy consumption associated with the process for mixing and aeration, since non-Newtonian fluid properties are developed with mycelial growth. Therefore, engineering the ratio of cellulolytic enzymes in the cocktail for more efficient cellulose hydrolysis is an alternative strategy for reducing cellulase dosage and thus saving cost in enzyme consumption for cellulose hydrolysis. In this study, T. reesei QS305 with high endoglucanase activity was developed from T. reesei Rut-C30 by replacing the transcription repressor gene ace1 with the coding region of endoglucanase gene egl1. Compared to T. reesei Rut-C30, T. reesei QS305 showed 90.0% and 132.7% increase in the activities of total cellulases and endoglucanases under flask culture conditions. When cellulase production by T. reesei QS305 was performed in the 5-L fermentor, cellulases activity of 10.7 FPU/mL was achieved at 108 h, 75.4% higher than that produced by T. reesei Rut-C30. Moreover, cellulases produced by T. reesei QS305 were more efficient for hydrolyzing pretreated corn stover and Jerusalem artichoke stalk.

AB Objective: To compare vascular endothelial function between dipping (D) and nondipping (ND) patterns in patients with and without mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using EndoPAT, a test of reactive hyperemia used to assess peripheral vascular endothelial function.
   Methods: The sample consisted of individuals of both genders between 18 and 65 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) of <= 35 kg/m(2) and apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of <= 15. The nondipping pattern was considered present when the dip of nocturnal blood pressure (NBP) was <10%. All of the sample underwent clinical and physical evaluation, full polysomnography, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and EndoPAT evaluation. A generalized linear model was used for statistical analysis.
   Results: The sample comprised 120 individuals, 35 in the control group and 85 in the mild OSA group. Four groups were formed: Control-ND, Control-D, Mild OSA-ND, and Mild OSA-D according to nocturnal ABPM patterns. The frequency of nondipping was (34.1%) in the Mild OSA group and (17.1%) in the Control group (p = 0.07). The Mild OSA-ND group had a higher augmentation index (AIx) than the Mild OSA-D group. Regression analysis showed that male gender, higher age, and nondipping status were associated with these results, whereas oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and AHI did not. With respect to the reactive hyperemia index (RHI), the Mild OSA-D group had lower values compared to the Control-ND group, but an association with OSA was not confirmed in the regression model.
   Conclusion: Nondipping status was associated with a worse augmentation index in both groups independently of AHI or oxygen desaturation index. Male gender, higher age, and nondipping status were associated with augmentation index. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Ontology evolution; Biomedical ontology; Semantic Web
ID MAPPINGS; WEB
AB The consistent evolution of ontologies is a major challenge for systems using semantically enriched data, for example, for annotating, indexing, or reasoning. The biomedical domain is a typical example where ontologies, expressed with different formalisms, have been used for a long time and whose dynamic nature requires the regular revision of underlying systems. However, the automatic identification of outdated concepts and proposition of revision actions to update them are still open research questions. Solutions to these problems are of great interest to organizations that manage huge and dynamic ontologies. In this paper, we present an approach for (i) identifying the concepts of an ontology that require revision and (ii) suggesting the type of revision. Our analysis is based on three aspects: structural information encoded in the ontology, relational information gained from external source of knowledge (i.e., PubMed and UMLS) and temporal information derived from the history of the ontology. Our approach aims to evaluate different methods and parameters used by supervised leaming classifiers to identify both the set of concepts that need revision, and the type of revision. We applied our approach to four well-known biomedical ontologies/terminologies (ICD-9-CM, MeSH, NCR and SNOMED CT) and compared our results to similar approaches. Our model shows accuracy ranging from 68% (for SNOMED CT) to 91% (for MeSH), and an average of 71% when considering all datasets together.

ID RELATEDNESS
AB Background: Word embeddings have been prevalently used in biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications due to the ability of the vector representations being able to capture useful semantic properties and linguistic relationships between words. Different textual resources (e.g., Wikipedia and biomedical literature corpus) have been utilized in biomedical NLP to train word embeddings and these word embeddings have been commonly leveraged as feature input to downstream machine learning models. However, there has been little work on evaluating the word embeddings trained from different textual resources.
   Methods: In this study, we empirically evaluated word embeddings trained from four different corpora, namely clinical notes, biomedical publications, Wikipedia, and news. For the former two resources, we trained word embeddings using unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data available at Mayo Clinic and articles (MedLit) from PubMed Central, respectively. For the latter two resources, we used publicly available pre-trained word embeddings, GloVe and Google News. The evaluation was done qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative evaluation, we randomly selected medical terms from three categories (i.e., disorder, symptom, and drug), and manually inspected the five most similar words computed by embeddings for each term. We also analyzed the word embeddings through a 2-dimensional visualization plot of 377 medical terms. For the quantitative evaluation, we conducted both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation. For the intrinsic evaluation, we evaluated the word embeddings' ability to capture medical semantics by measruing the semantic similarity between medical terms using four published datasets: Pedersen's dataset, Hliaoutakis's dataset, MayoSRS, and UMNSRS. For the extrinsic evaluation, we applied word embeddings to multiple downstream biomedical NLP applications, including clinical information extraction (IE), biomedical information retrieval (IR), and relation extraction (RE)-, with data from-shared tasks.
   Results: The qualitative evaluation shows that the word embeddings trained from EHR and MedLit can find more similar medical terms than those trained from GloVe and Google News. The intrinsic quantitative evaluation verifies that the semantic similarity captured by the word embeddings trained from EHR is closer to human experts' judgments on all four tested datasets. The extrinsic quantitative evaluation shows that the word embeddings trained on EHR achieved the best F1 score of 0.900 for the clinical IE task; no word embeddings improved the performance for the biomedical IR task; and the word embeddings trained on Google News had the best overall F1 score of 0.790 for the RE task.
   Conclusion: Based on the evaluation results, we can draw the following conclusions. First, the word embeddings trained from EHR and MedLit can capture the semantics of medical terms better, and find semantically relevant medical terms closer to human experts' judgments than those trained from GloVe and Google News. Second, there does not exist a consistent global ranking of word embeddings for all downstream biomedical NLP applications. However, adding word embeddings as extra features will improve results on most downstream tasks. Finally, the word embeddings trained from the biomedical domain corpora do not necessarily have better performance than those trained from the general domain corpora for any downstream biomedical NLP task.

AB In online health expert question-answering (HQA) services, it is significant to automatically determine the quality of the answers. There are two prominent challenges in this task. First, the answers are usually written in short text, which makes it difficult to absorb the text semantic information. Second, it usually lacks sufficient labeled data but contains a huge amount of unlabeled data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel deep co-training framework based on factorization machines (FM) and deep textual views to intelligently and automatically identify the quality of HQA systems. More specifically, we exploit additional domain-specific semantic information from domain-specific word embeddings to expand the semantic space of short text and apply FM to excavate the non-independent interaction relationships among diverse features within individual views for improving the performance of the base classifier via co-training. Our learned deep textual views, the convolutional neural networks (CNN) view which focuses on extracting local features using convolution filters to locally model short text and the dependency-sensitive convolutional neural networks (DSCNN) view which focuses on capturing long-distance dependency information within the text to globally model short text, can then overcome the challenge of feature sparseness in the short text answers from the doctors. The developed co-training framework can effectively mine the highly non-linear semantic information embedded in the unlabeled data and expose the highly non-linear relationships between different views, which minimizes the labeling effort. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the predictive performance of the answer quality in the context of HQA services.

AB Effective stratification of cancer patients on the basis of their molecular make-up is a key open challenge. Given the altered and heterogenous nature of cancer metabolism, we here propose to use the overall expression of central carbon metabolism as biomarker to characterize groups of patients with important characteristics, such as response to ad-hoc therapeutic strategies and survival expectancy.
   To this end, we here introduce the data integration framework named Metabolic Reaction Enrichment Analysis (MaREA), which strives to characterize the metabolic deregulations that distinguish cancer phenotypes, by projecting RNA-seq data onto metabolic networks, without requiring metabolic measurements. MaREA computes a score for each network reaction, based on the expression of the set of genes encoding for the associated enzyme(s). The scores are first used as features for cluster analysis and then to rank and visualize in an organized fashion the metabolic deregulations that distinguish cancer sub-types.
   We applied our method to recent lung and breast cancer RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and we were able to identify subgroups of patients with significant differences in survival expectancy. We show how the prognostic power of MaREA improves when an extracted and further curated core model focusing on central carbon metabolism is used rather than the genome-wide reference network.
   The visualization of the metabolic differences between the groups with best and worst prognosis allowed to identify and analyze key metabolic properties related to cancer aggressiveness. Some of these properties are shared across different cancer (sub) types, e.g., the up-regulation of nucleic acid and amino acid synthesis, whereas some other appear to be tumor-specific, such as the up- or down-regulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction, which display different patterns in distinct tumor (sub)types.
   These results might be soon employed to deliver highly automated diagnostic and prognostic strategies for cancer patients.

   Balancing strategies
ID INFORMATION EXTRACTION; MODEL
AB Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs suddenly after contact with an allergen. Epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis are very important in planning and evaluating new strategies that prevent this reaction, but also in providing a guide to the treatment of patients who have just suffered an anaphylactic reaction. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are one of the most effective and richest sources for the epidemiology of anaphylaxis, because they provide a low-cost way of accessing rich longitudinal data on large populations. However, a negative aspect is that researchers have to manually review a huge amount of information, which is a very costly and highly time consuming task. Therefore, our goal is to explore different machine learning techniques to process Big Data EMR, lessening the needed efforts for performing epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis. In particular, we aim to study the incidence of anaphylaxis by the automatic classification of EMR. To do this, we employ the most widely used and efficient classifiers in text classification and compare different document representations, which range from well-known methods such as Bag Of Words (BoW) to more recent ones based on word embedding models, such as a simple average of word embeddings or a bag of centroids of word embeddings. Because the identification of anaphylaxis cases in EMR is a class-imbalanced problem (less than 1% describe anaphylaxis cases), we employ a novel undersampling technique based on clustering to balance our dataset. In addition to classical machine learning algorithms, we also use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify our dataset. In general, experiments show that the most classifiers and representations are effective (F1 above 90%). Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Multilayer Perceptron and Random-Forest achieve an F1 around 95%, however linear methods have-considerably lower training times, CNN provides slightly better performance (F1 = 95.6%).

TI A novel depth estimation algorithm of chest compression for feedback of

AB Introduction: High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a key factor affecting cardiac arrest survival. Accurate monitoring and real-time feedback are emphasized to improve CPR quality. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a novel depth estimation algorithm based on a smartwatch equipped with a built-in accelerometer for feedback instructions during CPR.
   Methods: For data collection and model building, researchers wore an Android Wear smartwatch and performed chest compression-only CPR on a Resusci Anne QCPR training manikin. We developed an algorithm based on the assumptions that (1) maximal acceleration measured by the smartwatch accelerometer and the chest compression depth (CCD) are positively correlated and (2) the magnitude of acceleration at a specific time point and interval is correlated with its neighboring points. We defined a statistic value M as a function of time and the magnitude of maximal acceleration. We labeled and processed collected data and determined the relationship between M value, compression rate and CCD. We built a model accordingly, and developed a smartwatch app capable of detecting CCD. For validation, researchers wore a smartwatch with the preinstalled app and performed chest compression-only CPR on the manikin at target sessions. We compared the CCD results given by the smartwatch and the reference using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (WSRT), and used Bland-Altman (BA) analysis to-assess-the agreement between the two methods.
   Results: We analyzed a total of 3978 compressions that covered the target rate of 80-140/min and CCD of 4-7 cm. WSRT showed that there was no significant difference between the two methods (P = 0.084). By BA analysis the mean of differences was 0.003 and the bias between the two methods was not significant (95% CI: -0.079 to 0.085).
   Conclusion: Our study indicates that the algorithm developed for estimating CCD based on a smartwatch with a built-in accelerometer is promising. Further studies will be conducted to evaluate its application for CPR training and clinical practice.

AB Background: Although birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, methods for observing human pregnancies with birth defect outcomes are limited.
   Objective: The primary objectives of this study were (i) to assess whether rare health-related events-in this case, birth defects-are reported on social media, (ii) to design and deploy a natural language processing (NLP) approach for collecting such sparse data from social media, and (iii) to utilize the collected data to discover a cohort of women whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes could be observed on social media for epidemiological analysis.
   Methods: To assess whether birth defects are mentioned on social media, we mined 432 million tweets posted by 112,647 users who were automatically identified via their public announcements of pregnancy on Twitter. To retrieve tweets that mention birth defects, we developed a rule-based, bootstrapping approach, which relies on a lexicon, lexical variants generated from the lexicon entries, regular expressions, post-processing, and manual analysis guided by distributional properties. To identify users whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes could be observed for epidemiological analysis, inclusion criteria were (i) tweets indicating that the user's child has a birth defect, and (ii) accessibility to the user's tweets during pregnancy. We conducted a semi-automatic evaluation to estimate the recall of the tweet-collection approach, and performed a preliminary assessment of the prevalence of selected birth defects among the pregnancy cohort derived from Twitter.
   Results: We manually annotated 16,822 retrieved tweets, distinguishing tweets indicating that the user's child has a birth defect (true positives) from tweets that merely mention birth defects (false positives). Inter-annotator agreement was substantial: K = 0.79 (Cohen's kappa). Analyzing the timelines of the 646 users whose tweets were true positives resulted in the discovery of 195 users that met the inclusion criteria. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect reported on Twitter, consistent with findings in the general population. Based on an evaluation of 4169 tweets retrieved using alternative text mining methods, the recall of the tweet collection approach was 0.95.
   Conclusions: Our contributions include (i) evidence that rare health-related events are indeed reported on Twitter, (ii) a generalizable, systematic NLP approach for collecting sparse tweets, (iii) a semi-automatic method to identify undetected tweets (false negatives), and (iv) a collection of publicly available tweets by pregnant users with birth defect outcomes, which could be used for future epidemiological analysis. In future work, the annotated tweets could be used to train machine learning algorithms to automatically identify users reporting birth defect outcomes, enabling the large-scale use of social media mining as a complementary method for such epidemiological research.

AB This paper proposes an effective and robust approach for Chemical-Induced Disease (CID) relation extraction from PubMed articles. The study was performed on the Chemical Disease Relation (CDR) task of BioCreative V track-3 corpus. The proposed system, named re1SCAN, is an efficient CID relation extraction system with two phases to classify relation instances from the Co-occurrence and Non-Co-occurrence mention levels. We describe the case of chemical and disease mentions that occur in the same sentence as 'Co-occurrence', or as 'Non-Co-occurrence' otherwise. In the first phase, the relation instances are constructed on both mention levels. In the second phase, we employ a hybrid feature set to classify the relation instances at both of these mention levels using the combination of two Machine Learning (ML) classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM) and J48 Decision tree). This system is entirely corpus dependent and does not rely on information from external resources in order to boost its performance. We achieved good results, which are comparable with the other state-of-the-art CID relation extraction systems on the BioCreative V corpus. Furthermore, our system achieves the best performance on the Non-Co-occurrence mention level.

AB Objective: We present a method for comparing association networks in a matched case-control design, which provides a high-level comparison of co-occurrence patterns of features after adjusting for confounding factors. We demonstrate this approach by examining the differential distribution of chronic medical conditions in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to the distribution of these conditions in their matched controls.
   Materials and methods: Newly diagnosed MDD patients were matched to controls based on their demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, place of residence, and healthcare service utilization in the Korean National Health Insurance Service's National Sample Cohort. Differences in the networks of chronic medical conditions in newly diagnosed MDD cases treated with antidepressants, and their matched controls, were prioritized with a permutation test accounting for the false discovery rate. Sensitivity analyses for the associations between prioritized pairs of chronic medical conditions and new MDD diagnosis were performed with regression modeling.
   Results: By comparing the association networks of chronic medical conditions in newly diagnosed depression patients and their matched controls, five pairs of such conditions were prioritized among 105 possible pairs after controlling the false discovery rate at 5%. In sensitivity analyses using regression modeling, four out of the five prioritized pairs were statistically significant for the interaction terms.
   Conclusion: Association networks in a matched case-control design can provide a high-level comparison of co-morbid features after adjusting for confounding factors, thereby supplementing traditional clinical study approaches. We demonstrate the differential co-occurrence pattern of chronic medical conditions in patients with MDD and prioritize the chronic conditions that have statistically significant interactions in regression models for depression.

AB The process of discovering novel drugs to treat diseases requires a long time and high cost. It is important to understand side effects of drugs as well as their therapeutic effects, because these can seriously damage the patients due to unexpected actions of the derived candidate drugs. In order to overcome these limitations, computational methods for predicting the therapeutic effects and side effects have been proposed. In particular, text mining is a widely used technique in the field of systems biology, because it can discover hidden relationships between drugs, genes and diseases from a large amount of literature data. Compared with in vivo/in vitro experiments, text mining derives meaningful results with less time and cost.
   In this study, we propose an algorithm for predicting novel drug-phenotype associations and drug-side effect associations using topic modeling and natural language processing (NLP). We extract sentences in which drugs and genes co-occur from the abstracts of the literature and identify words that describe the relationship between them using NLP. Considering the characteristics of the identified words, we determine if the drug has an up regulation effect or a down-regulation effect on the gene. Based on genes that affect drugs and their regulatory relationships, we group the frequently occurring genes and regulatory relationships into topics, and build a drug topic probability matrix by calculating the score that the drug will have a topic using topic modeling. Using the matrix, a classifier is constructed for predicting the novel indications and side effects of drugs considering the characteristics of known drug-phenotype associations or drug-side effect associations.
   The proposed method predicts both indications and side effects with a single algorithm, and it can exclude drugs with serious side effects or side effects that patients do not want to experience from among the candidate drugs provided for the treatment of the phenotype. Furthermore, lists of novel candidate drugs for phenotypes and side effects can be continuously updated with our algorithm every time a document is added. More than a thousand documents are produced per day, and it is possible for our algorithm to efficiently derive candidate drugs because it requires less cost than the existing drug repositioning methods.

AB Relation extraction between medical concepts from electronic medical records has pervasive applications as well as significance. However, previous researches utilizing machine learning algorithms judge the semantic types of medical concept pair mentions independently. In fact, different concept pair mentions in the same context are of dependencies which can provide beneficial evidences for identifying their relation types. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has considered such dependencies in discharge summaries. However, its hard constraints are not applied effectively to the History of Present Illness (HPI) in electronic Medical Records. According to the writing characteristics of HPI records, we generalize two regularities of dependencies among concept pairs mentioned in an HPI record to enhance the performance of relation extraction. We incorporate the two soft constraints corresponding to the regularities and the posterior probabilities returned by a local classifier into a joint inference process which applies Integer Quadratic Programming method to carry out collective classification for all concept pair mentions in an HPI record. We implement four local classification models including support vector machine, logistics regression, random forest and piecewise convolutional neural networks to examine the performance of our approach. A series of experimental results demonstrate that our collective classification method has made a principal improvement and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.

AB The detection of Adverse Medical Events (AMEs) plays an important role in disease management in ensuring efficient treatment delivery and quality improvement of health services. Recently, with the rapid development of hospital information systems, a large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been produced, in which AMEs are regularly documented in a free-text manner. In this study, we are concemed with the problem of AME detection by utilizing a large volume of unstructured EHR data. To address this challenge, we propose a neural attention network-based model to incorporate the contextual information of words into AME detection. Specifically, we develop a context-aware attention mechanism to locate salient words with respect to the target AMEs in patient medical records. And then we combine the proposed context attention mechanism with the deep learning tactic to boost the performance of AME detection. We validate our proposed model on a real clinical dataset that consists of 8845 medical records of patients with cardiovascular diseases. The experimental results show that our proposed model advances state-of-the-art models and achieves competitive performance in terms of AME detection.

AB Prostate cancer (PC) is more common cancer in older men. Then, the existing evaluation method of PC risk grades is based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging/scoring system. It utilizes the comprehensive risk data of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, Gleason score, and T-2 staging score as the evaluation criteria of PC patients. However, these risk data of PC patients not only may belong to different risk grades simultaneously to result in the unreasonable and uncertain evaluation results to some extent, but also may lose useful fuzzy and uncertain information in the existing evaluation method with non-fuzzy information. To overcome these insufficiencies, the research problems in this study are: (a) to present a new concept of a cubic hesitant fuzzy set (CHFS) for expressing uncertain and hesitant fuzzy information; (b) to propose the generalized distance and similarity measure between CHFSs; (c) to establish a comprehensive evaluation method of PC risk grades with CHFS information by using the similarity measure of CHFSs; and (d) to provide the evaluation examples of PC patients as actual clinical cases for indicating the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed risk evaluation method. Then, the main contribution of this original study is that we present a new concept of CHFS to express uncertain and hesitant information of PC risk grades and the generalized distance-based similarity measure of CHFSs to establish a comprehensive evaluation method of PC risk grades. Finally, by the 16 evaluation examples of the PC patients, all their evaluation results verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed comprehensive evaluation method. The comparative analysis demonstrates that its evaluation performance is superior to that of the existing evaluation method of PC risk grades.

AB Due to importantly beneficial, effects on physical and mental health and strong association with many rehabilitation programs, Physical Activity Recognition and Monitoring (PARM) have been considered as a key paradigm for smart healthcare. Traditional methods for PARM focus on controlled environments with the aim of increasing the types of identifiable activity subjects complete and improving recognition accuracy and system robustness by means of novel body-worn sensors or advanced learning algorithms. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabling technology is transferring PARM studies to open and connected uncontrolled environments by connecting heterogeneous cost-effective wearable devices and mobile apps. Little is currently known about whether traditional PARM technologies can tackle the new challenges of IoT environments and how to effectively harness and improve these technologies. In an effort to understand the use of IoT technologies in PARM studies, this paper will give a systematic review, critically examining PARM studies from a typical IoT layer-based perspective. It will firstly summarize the state-of-the-art in traditional PARM methodologies as used in the healthcare domain, including sensory, feature extraction and recognition techniques. The paper goes on to identify some new research trends and challenges of PARM studies in the IoT environments, and discusses some key enabling techniques for tackling them. Finally, this paper consider some of the successful case studies in the area and look at the possible future industrial applications of PARM in smart healthcare.

AB Recently, the growing demand for energy along the environmental concerns, as well as the limitation of fossil fuels, have made it necessary to research in and develop the field of renewable energies. The concept of a multi-generation energy system could be a reliable solution for future needs. In the current study, a novel integrated energy system based on solar energy was considered and analyzed in details by assisting the exergy and exergo-economic methodology. Using the concentrative photovoltaic thermal solar collectors, as the prime energy source, the proposed system comprised of both daytime mode and nighttime mode cycles, in order to continuously generate power. The factors influencing the performance of the system were investigated by a parametric study and the overall system outputs are reported in specified conditions. Related to the mentioned conditions, the output power of the electrical demand was 1000 kW in the daytime mode and the refrigeration capacity was 43.11 MW. In the case of nighttime mode, the output power was 823.1 kW. Considering these data, the overall exergy efficiencies were 21.24% and 35.86%, respectively, Furthermore, an economic analysis was done based on the energy generation of the integrated system. Results indicated that the proposed system was shown, great economic viability with a unit cost of generated electrical energy about 4.617 $/GJ and a unit cost of cooling effect about 299.3 $/GJ in daytime mode. Moreover, the unit cost of generated electrical energy in night time mode is 56.21 $/GJ. Moreover, the system provided the required energy sustainably through the year and by using clean energy sources prevented a total amount of 220469.3 ton of annual carbon emission, which is equal to 20,339 ha of forest absorbing carbon.

AB A building integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPV/T) system was designed and analyzed. The BIPV/T system is composed of multiple PV/T air collectors integrated into the building facade and connected to an air handling unit (AHU) to control the air flow. The system operates with two applications, an application for cold weather and an other for hot weather. In cold weather, the BIPV/T system recovers heat from the PV modules to preheat the outdoor fresh air. While in hot weather, the cool air exhausted from the conditioned spaces of the building is used to decrease the PV cells temperature, instead of ambient air as in conventional PV/T air collectors. An experimental tests were conducted to see the effect of using the cool exhaust air as coolant for the PV cells instead of ambient air. In order to predict thermal and electrical performance of each PV/T air collector under real climatic conditions, a theoretical model of a single pass PV/T air collector was developed and validated against experimental observations from previous literature. The theoretical and experimental comparison between the case of using exhaust air as coolant and the case of using ambient air as coolant showed an important decrease in PV cells temperature. The maximum decrease value in PV cells temperature obtained from the simulation is 9.46 degrees C in a selected day from August, while the electrical simulation showed that the average increase value in electrical efficiency in a selected day from August is 0.350. The simulation of the BIPV/T system in cold weather indicated that the average rate of saved useful thermal energy when using preheated outdoor fresh air in a selected day from February is 24.20%. Furthermore, the PV/T air collector performances were compared for the optimal tilt angle and the complete vertical position. The results revealed that installing the PV/T air collector at optimal tilt angle showed much better performances than a one installed at a complete vertical position, especially the electrical performance in Summer.

AB A novel design of tube structure with cosine wave is proposed in this study to investigate effects of wavy surface characteristics on enhancement of heat transfer in a shell and tube heat exchanger, experimentally. All experiments have been designed and carried out on water/water loops. Response Surface Methodology is used to investigate the optimization procedure. Four effective parameters of wavy starting length (0 mm <= b <= 120 mm), hot water flow rates (11 l/min <= Q(c) <= 19 l/min), cold water flow rates (7 l/min <= Q(h) <= 11 l/min) and wavy wavelength (0 mm <= lambda <= 80 mm) in five levels was selected to obtain the maximum thermal performance factor. The results showed that the thermal performance factor reduces by increasing of the hot water flow rate. The thermal performance factor of wave tubes is found to be larger than that of smooth tubs. Optimizing of the procedure indicated that to maximize the thermal performance factor, the lower values of wave starting length and hot water flow rate, and higher values of cold water flow rate and a wavelength of 33.13 mm, must be selected. Also results show that the corrugating process is useful from economic analysis point of view.

AB This paper proposes a new methodology to find the most economic system configuration and energy management strategy for Li-ion battery based off-grid renewable energy systems. A system level macroscopic model and a microscopic battery lifetime prediction model are incorporated into the optimization framework to simulate hourly performance of the system. Due to the computational efficiency of the model, optimization is carried out using enumerative method {evaluating all the possible combinations of components and control strategies) to ensure finding the global optimum solution of the problem. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the optimization results are compared with a baseline scenario which is an installed PV-battery system to provide electricity for an isolated house situated near Zaragoza, Spain. Results indicate that the optimized scenario leads to 9.7% reduction in the levelized cost of energy and 48.6% improvement in the battery service period in comparison with the baseline scenario. Moreover, by considering a 0.5% unmet load, the economic feasibility of the system and the battery longevity are enhanced to 14.6% and 78.4%, respectively. Finally, to evaluate the effect of battery unit price and future trends on the optimization results, sensitivity analysis is performed.

AB Herein, the mechanochemical process combined diluted acid impregnation and ball-milling treatment was developed to overcome the recalcitrance of lignocellulose. The high-yield fermentable sugars (glucose and xylose) and impregnated enzymatic lignin (IEL) streams have been simultaneously obtained via mechanochemistry and enzymatic hydrolysis process. It was found that the mechanochemical pretreatment significantly facilitated the enzymatic hydrolysis of the treated substrates, releasing high yield (> 90%) of fermentable sugars for further utilization. CP/MAS C-13 NMR and solution-state 2D NMR techniques showed that the crystallinity index (CrI) and degree of polymerization (DP) of cellulose in the treated substrates were both decreased. In addition, detailed structural characterizations of the obtained IEL fractions were achieved by the state-of-the-art NMR and GPC techniques. Results showed that the IEL fractions presented similar structural features as compared to the corresponding native lignin (DEL). The study provides an efficient and clean pathway for the conversion of energy from lignocelluloses; meanwhile, the residual lignin with unchanged structures could serve as ideal feedstock for the liquid fuel, bio-based materials, and chemicals in the current biorefinery process.

AB In this study, an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is proposed to be integrated with the flue gas pre-compression process to reduce the energy cost resulting from Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). An equation-based flowsheet optimization model is developed considering the mixture working fluid design, ORC operating conditions and the compression process simultaneously. The optimal number of stages of CO2 compression, the working fluid composition and the optimal operating conditions of ORCs and the compression train can be determined simultaneously using the proposed mathematical model. Proper heat integration can boost the power output of the ORC system significantly. The heat integration model considering variable process streams is extended to the integrated ORC and flue gas compression train process. The results show that the optimal number of stages is 4 and a pure working fluid could perform better than a mixture working fluid if operating conditions are chosen properly. The integration of ORCs can reduce the energy penalty by 7.9% compared with the original optimal design that did not include ORCs. In addition, one compressor stage is avoided.

AB A three-evaporator and dual-ejector refrigeration system was presented in this paper. By combining two single ejectors as a whole, the authors attempted to discuss the effects of key geometric dimensions of each stage on both stage performances with two-dimensional CFD simulation method. First, the CFD models were validated by experimental data. Then, the primary nozzle diameters of both stages were determined by the cooling load demands of the refrigerating and air-conditioning chambers. Next, the detailed effects of key geometric parameters such as the length of constant-pressure mixing section, the length of constant-area mixing section and area ratio of each stage on two-stage performances were identified with simulations. Finally, the optimum values of the key geometric parameters were obtained, and the results showed that the area ratio had the most significant influences on the entrainment ratio of both stages as compared to other parameters.

AB A series of novel disc-shaped wind rotors used in the small-scale wind turbine are redesigned with the inspiration from the eco whisper turbine. The aerodynamic parameters such as power coefficient and torque coefficient are obtained by numerical simulation and wind tunnel test. The tip speed ratio, pitch angle and opening angle are taken into consideration to account for the influences on the power coefficient. The specific case with pitch angle of 30 degrees and opening angle of 45 degrees is tested in a wind tunnel and simulated with different turbulence models for Reynolds number in the range of 6.8 x 10(4)-1.70 x 10(5), respectively. The results indicated that: (1) the numerical results based on the standard k-omega model agree well with the experimental results; (2) the orthogonal method shows the rank of influencing factors is pitch angle, opening angle and tip speed ratio, whose contributions to the power coefficient are about 66.36%, 18.53% and 11.43%, respectively; (3) the effects of both pitch angle and opening angle on power coefficient may be positive or negative, depending on the level of tip speed ratio; (4) as tip speed ratio increases, peak power coefficient can be achieved for an individual pitch angle or opening angle; (5) the value of tip speed ratio correspondent to the peak power coefficient decreases with decreasing pitch angle or opening angle; (6) the rotor with pitch angle of 20 degrees and opening angle of 30 degrees at a tip speed ratio of 1.4 provides the highest power coefficient of 0.47. The maximum power coefficient in the present paper is higher than most of the rotors in literature according to the comparison.

AB Microgrids are increasingly being used as a platform to integrate distributed generation such as renewable energy sources and (RESs) conventional sources in both grid-connected and isolated power systems. Due to the inherent intermittent nature of RESs, energy storage systems (ESSs) that can absorb fluctuations have become inevitable. Nevertheless, large capacities of ESSs increase the initial cost while small capacities lead to instabilities and increase in the cost of conventional fuels. Therefore, finding the optimal size of the ESS for a given application is essential for the reliable, efficient and economical operation of a microgrid. Once the battery size is decided, maintaining its energy at appropriate levels is essential to ensure stable and safe operation of the microgrid. This paper presents a novel expert fuzzy system - grey wolf optimization (FL-GWO) based intelligent meta-heuristic method for battery sizing and energy management. The proposed energy management operation is carried out by a Grey Wolf Optimiser (GWO) that is helped to set the membership functions and rules of the fuzzy logic expert system. The unit commitment (UC) issue, which is essential for the proper operation of the isolated microgrid, has been additionally considered in this paper. To verify the performance of the proposed method, results are compared with the rules-based method and traditional GWO algorithm. It has been proven from the results that the FL-GWO has a significant convergence property and capability to minimize the Levelized Cost Of Electricity (LCOE) by 14.13% and 24.15% compared with conventional GWO algorithm and rules-based method, respectively. The weather conditions for different climates is used to verify the performance of the intelligent energy management method under different operating scenarios. The results show that the intelligent online multi-objective energy management strategy is capable of managing a smooth power flow with the same optimal configuration in the isolated microgrid, minimising the fossil fuel utilisation and reducing the CO2 emission level.

AB This study focused on circuitry arrangement optimization for a multi-tube phase change material heat exchanger. The optimization approach was developed based on a genetic algorithm approach coupled with numerical simulation and was aimed at maximizing the equivalent hot water output during the discharging process. Validated two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations were used to support the genetic algorithm optimization process and to accurately investigate the thermal performance of the optimal circuitry arrangement. The results showed that adding more connections near the outlet side of the phase change material heat exchanger could lengthen the flow path in the high temperature zone, which was beneficial for a high mass flow rate condition of 1.68 kg min(-1) with a 5% increment. Under medium and low mass flow rates of 1.2 kg min(-1) and 0.5 kg min(-1), a 3% increment and a 6% decrement, respectively, were observed. It was found that different mass flow rates require their own optimal circuitry arrangements, and the arranged rules were not necessarily the same. Therefore, circuitry arrangement optimization should be performed according to the operating flow rate or designed range to maximize the optimization effect. The proposed optimization approach could serve as an effective way to improve the energy efficiency of multi-tube latent thermal energy storage systems.

AB This work proposed a two-stage pretreatment with alkaline sulphonation and steam treatment, and investigated its efficiency for converting Eucalyptus woody biomass to fermentable sugars and bioethanol. Comparing with steam pretreatment and subsequent sulphonation, this alkaline sulphonation-steam pretreatment improved carbohydrate recovery by maintaining a more neutral pH throughout the pretreatment process, while promoting the enzymatic digestibility of biomass through lignin removal and modification. Results showed that the alkaline sulphonation-steam pretreatment caused lignin removal of 69.37% and 120.28 mmol/kg acid groups incorporation into substrate, both of which could lead to significantly improved cellulose accessibility. About 80% of the sugars present in the original carbohydrate (cellulose and hemicellulose) were released, which could be recovered after pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. The sugars released from enzymatic hydrolysis of substrate pretreated by alkaline sulphonation-steam pretreatment could be efficiently converted to ethanol, indicating that alkaline sulphonation-steam two-stage pretreatment is a promising pretreatment approach of lignocellulosic biomass for the production of biofuels.

AB A precise estimate of PV panels temperature is crucial for accurately assessing their electrical performance. Therefore, in this study, one of the main aims has been to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the PV cell temperature, by using realistic boundary conditions. Unlike previous thermal models in the literature, which usually focus on its mere application, a detailed step by step development and numerical implementation of the complete model has also been provided in great details in this work. The developed model is transient, so it can fully simulate the thermal performance of any PV panel under time-varying field conditions. Once the model is defined for a specific PV panel, the only external inputs it needs are the total incident solar irradiation, wind speed and the ambient temperature. The model has been adequately validated through PV panel's datasheet provided information, literature data and against a versatile set of experimental data under various weather conditions. After thorough validations, the developed model was compared to various other widely used empirical, analytical and numerical thermal models from the literature. The comparison shows that by using realistic boundary conditions, the developed thermal model has far better prediction accuracy than other models from the literature. The methodology presented in this study is completely generic. That is, though it has been implemented and validated here for a silicon-based PV module the approach may be used to model any freestanding plane PV surface, with appropriate modifications to layer thicknesses and material properties. A range of weather conditions may also be accommodated.

AB Reversible solid oxide cells may be a cost competitive energy storage technology at the distributed scale. Leveraging C-O-H chemistry and operating near 600 degrees C allows the cells to be exothermic in both modes, improving efficiency and operability. This study characterizes ReSOC balance-of-plant hardware off-design performance to investigate component mode compatibility, the effect of tank dynamics, and part-load performance for a 100 kW/800 kWh plant. We also introduce a variable volume floating piston tank concept to improve energy storage density and evaluate operability advantages. Results show that with proper system design, balance-of-plant components are compatible, and tank dynamics have minimal impact when tanks are uninsulated and designed for storage near ambient temperature. System AC roundtrip efficiency is between 53% and 54%, depending on the tank technology selected and the compressor operating approach. Energy density is 84.4 kWh/m(3) for rigid tanks, and 146.1 kWh/m(3) for the variable volume tank concept at 100 bar storage pressure. This study also shows that ReSOC systems can maintain high efficiency at part-loads as low as 15% of rated capacity, Economic analysis of the system estimates an installed capital cost of $422-452/kWh, and a levelized cost of storage of 18.8-19.6 (sic)/kWh, values competitive with state-of-the-art battery technology.

AB This research is aimed at geometric analysis of parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) in different sizes of the main components of the system. The rate of the Local Concentration Ratio (LCR) on the receiver tube and optical efficiency are two main features in geometric optimization of the parabolic trough solar collectors. In this work, parabolic trough solar collector was optimized for different sizes with three design variables; the receiver diameter, the collector aperture width and the rim angle. The method used in this research was the Monte Carlo Method (MCM) in MATLAB. The optical and geometric modeling was developed for coding in MATLAB. For the case study, a parabolic trough solar collector was used in the laboratory. The current results showed that the optical efficiency of 65% was obtained for the collector components with the collector aperture width of 0.6 m, rim angle of 100 degrees and receiver diameter of 0.025 m. Also, the optical efficiency of 61% was obtained for the collector with the aperture width of 0.7 m, rim angle of 90 degrees, and diameter receiver of 0.025 m.

AB Pyrolysis of waste tire is attracting widespread interest recently because of the great potential in waste valorization treatment. In this study, the thermal decomposition behavior, pyrolysis mechanism and products distribution of waste bicycle tire were investigated by means of TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS. According to the TG results, two main pyrolysis stages of waste bicycle tire were observed, which were considered as the decomposition of rubber (285-531 degrees C) and further pyrolysis of pyrolytic products (663-847 degrees C), respectively. The volatiles release characteristics and FTIR spectrum at different temperatures exhibited good consistency with pyrolysis behavior. A detail information of pyrolysis products was analyzed by Py-GC/MS, which mainly include gaseous, alkenes and aromatics. The pyrolysis mechanism of waste bicycle tire was belong to free radical reaction, and the possible further pyrolysis pathway of D-limonene and styrene was also presented. Moreover, the products distribution under different pyrolysis final temperatures and heating rates conditions were summarized. Thus, this study could enhance our understanding on more specific details for the pyrolysis process of waste tire to some extent.

AB This paper proposes a novel hybrid refrigeration system with energy storage, driven by low-grade solar heat and consisting of a single-stage absorption cycle coupled with a thermochemical process by sharing the same condenser, evaporator and refrigerant fluid. A first screening of ammonia-based working pairs for evaporation temperatures of - 10 degrees C, condensation temperatures of 30 degrees C and heat source temperatures of 80 degrees C reveals LiNO3 as suitable sorbent salt for the absorption subsystem, and BaCl2, PbBr2, SrCl2, LiCl, NH4Br and SnCl2 as candidate reactive salts in the thermochemical subsystem. The subsequent parametric study indicates that the absorption subsystem with NH3/LiNO3 reaches close-to-maximum COP at the indicated conditions, and the thermochemical subsystem delivers its highest COP with the NH3/BaCl2 pair. Then, the power-storage and performance-storage relationships of the thermochemical subsystem are analyzed for the NH3/BaCl2 pair with respect to variations in operating conditions and several implementation parameters of the reactive composite. Finally, the performance of the hybrid system with the (NH3/LiNO3 + NH3/BaCl2) pair combination is compared to its subsystems against a variable demand profile calculated from climatic data of July in Barcelona, Spain. A novel indicator is defined to assess demand coverage: the Coefficient of Satisfaction of Demand (CSD). Depending on solar collector field area and amount of refrigerant storable by the thermochemical subsystem, the hybrid system reaches up to 24% higher CSD than the reference system (a solar single-stage absorption refrigerator with no storage), and at least 14% higher COP than the thermochemical process.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of composition ratios of working fluids and pressure drops in heat exchangers on the performance of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system employing R245fa/R236fa for waste heat recovery (WHR). Thermodynamic analysis, heat transfer calculation, and the cost-evaluation of apparatus and maintenance of the ORC system are applied to assess the levelized energy cost for the economic performance. Moreover, exergoeconomic factors of the components in the ORC system are calculated. The results indicate that the ORC system cycled with R245fa/R236fa mixture has higher thermodynamic and economic performances than ORC system with either pure-component of R236fa or pure-component of R245fa. At optimal mixture ratio, R245fa/R236fa has higher net power output than R245fa by 7.07% and lower levelized energy cost than R236fa by 3.07%. Both the saturated temperature of liquid working fluid and the proportion of R236fa in R245fa/R236fa mixture increase as pressure drops in the heat exchangers of the ORC system increase. As pressure drop ratio equals to 0.16, R245fa/R236fa with optimal composition ratio is thermodynamically superior to R236fa and R245fa by 2.16% and 9.07%, respectively. Similarly, at the optimal composition ratio, R245fa/R236fa mixture also performs better than R236fa by 2.37% or R245fa by 1.5% in economic analysis. As for exergoeconomic factors, relatively high values for the pump and expander and moderate values for the heat exchanger devices are obtained in the system. On the whole, the values of exergoeconomic factor increase with composition ratio of R245fa/R236fa mixture. Compared with R245fa and R245fa/R236fa mixtures, R236fa has the highest value of exergoeconomic factor for each component of the ORC system. Finally, the correlations of the optimal thermodynamic and economic performances of the ORC system with R245fa/R236fa are proposed for WHR.

AB In this study, an innovative concentrated solar power plant integrated with desalination process and absorption refrigeration cycle aimed at supplying power, fresh water and refrigeration, was developed and exergetically assessed. The system comprised a concentrated solar thermal power plant with parabolic dish collectors and steam turbine, a multi-effect desalination process with parallel feed of seawater, and a single-stage ammonia water absorption refrigeration system. Generally, the collectors provided 21,030 kW thermal power to the steam power plant and 4632 kW of which was converted to electrical power in steam power plant. The absorption refrigeration cycle produced 820.8 kW refrigeration and the desalination cycle provided fresh water at a rate of 22.79 kg/s. The integrated system was simulated in Aspen Hysys and all the components of the integrated system were individually scrutinized based on the second law of thermodynamics; as well, the exergy destruction rate and exergy efficiency of each component were obtained and discussed thoroughly. According to the results, about 86% of the total exergy destruction rate of the system belonged to the distillation column and heat exchangers. The overall exergy efficiency of the cycle was 66.05%, while, the net overall thermal efficiency of the integrated system was 80.70%. The results of the economic analysis showed that the proposed integrated structure had an investment return period of 5.738 years and a net annual profit of 6.828 million US$ per year. Moreover, the impact of various factors on the performance of the integrated system was investigated using sensitivity analysis.

AB Measurement, prediction, and modeling of currency price volatility constitutes an important area of research at both the national and corporate level. Countries attempt to understand currency volatility to set national economic policies and firms to best manage exchange rate risk and leverage assets. A relatively new technological invention that the corporate treasurer has to turn to as part of the overall financial strategy is cryptocurrency. One estimate values the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies at $557 billion USD at the beginning of 2018. While the overall size of the market for cryptocurrency is significant, our understanding of the behavior of this instrument is only beginning. In this article, we propose a hybrid Artificial Neural Network-Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ANN-GARCH) model with preprocessing to forecast the price volatility of bitcoin, the most traded and largest by market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies.

AB Analyzing a large number of documents for sentiment analysis entails huge complexity and cost. To alleviate this burden, dimensionality reduction has been applied to documents as a preprocessing step. Among dimensionality reduction algorithms, compared with feature selection, feature extraction can reduce information loss and achieve a higher discriminating power in sentiment classification. However, feature extraction suffers from lack of interpretability and many nonlinear extraction methods, which generally outperform linear methods, are not applicable for sentiment classification because of the characteristics that only provide corresponding low-dimensional coordinates without mapping. Therefore, this research proposes an improved semi-supervised dimensionality reduction framework that simultaneously preserves the advantages of feature extraction and addresses the drawbacks for sentiment classification. The proposed framework is mainly based on linear feature extraction providing mapping and feature weighting is applied before feature extraction. Feature weighting and extraction are conducted in a semi supervised manner so that both label information and structural information of data can be considered. The superiority of both feature weighting and feature extraction was verified by conducting extensive experiments in six benchmark datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we study the visualization of complex structures in the context of automatic graph drawing. Constructing geometric representations of combinatorial structures, such as networks or graphs, is a difficult task that requires an expert system. The automatic generation of drawings of graphs finds many applications from software engineering to social media. The objective of graph drawing expert systems is to generate layouts that are easy to read and understand. This main objective is achieved by solving several optimization problems. In this paper we focus on the most important one: reducing the number of arc crossings in the graph. This hard optimization problem has been studied extensively in the last decade, proposing many exact and heuristic methods to minimize the total number of arc crossings. However, despite its practical significance, the min-max variant in which the maximum number of crossings over all edges is minimized, has received very little attention. We propose new heuristic methods based on the strategic oscillation methodology to solve this NP-hard optimization problem. Our experimentation shows that the new method compares favorably with the existing ones, implemented in current graph drawing expert systems. Therefore, a direct application of our findings will improve these functionality (i.e., crossing reduction) of drawing systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metaheuristics provide high-level instructions for designing heuristic optimisation algorithms and have been successfully applied to a range of computationally hard real-world problems. Local search meta heuristics operate under a single-point based search framework with the goal of iteratively improving a solution in hand over time with respect to a single objective using certain solution perturbation strategies, known as move operators, and move acceptance methods starting from an initially generated solution. Performance of a local search method varies from one domain to another, even from one instance to another in the same domain. There is a growing number of studies on 'more general' search methods referred to as cross-domain search methods, or hyper-heuristics, that operate at a high-level solving characteristically different problems, preferably without expert intervention. This paper provides a taxonomy and overview of existing local search metaheuristics along with an empirical study into the effects that move acceptance methods, as components of single-point based local search metaheuristics, have on the cross-domain performance of such algorithms for solving multiple combinatorial optimisation problems. The experimental results across a benchmark of nine different computationally hard problems highlight the shortcomings of existing and well-known methods for use as components of cross-domain search methods, despite being re-tuned for solving each domain.

AB Most machine learning algorithms possess hyperparameters. For example, an artificial neural network requires the determination of the number of hidden layers, nodes, and many other parameters related to the model fitting process. Despite this, there is still no clear consensus on how to tune them. The most popular methodology is an exhaustive grid search, which can be highly inefficient and sometimes infeasible. Another common solution is to change one hyperparameter at a time and measure its effect on the model's performance. However, this can also be inefficient and does not guarantee optimal results since it ignores interactions between the hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose to use the Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology (factorial designs) for screening and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to tune a machine learning algorithm's hyperparameters. An application of our methodology is presented with a detailed discussion of the results of a random forest case-study using a publicly available dataset. Benefits include fewer training runs, better parameter selection, and a disciplined approach based on statistical theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The autolysis of pretreated bovine skin (PBS) (treated with 0.1 M NaOH and 1% HCl), its endogenous proteases, inhibitors and their effects on quality attributes of gelatin were examined. PBS was subjected to different temperatures (20-90 degrees C) and pH (2-9) and treated with different protease inhibitors. Maximum autolytic activity of PBS was observed at 40 degrees C and pH 5. Ethylene-bis (oxyethylenenitrilo) tetraacetic acid (EGTA) was the most effective in impeding the degradation of gamma-, beta- and alpha- chains of PBS protein indicating that metallocollagenases were the predominant endogenous proteases in bovine skin. Gelatin was extracted in the absence (GAE) and presence (GPE) of EGTA, and EGTA with papain enzyme (GPEP). GPEP had a higher yield and lower gel strength than GEA and GPE. Metallocollagenases partook in the degradation of gelatin thereby affecting its functional properties. Pretreating PBS with or without EGTA, and papain influenced the quality attributes of gelatin.

AB Properties of starches isolated from soft and hard wheat dough after freezing/thawing (F/T) treatment were investigated. Significance of results was observed between isolated hard wheat starch (HWS) and soft wheat starch (SWS), but both cultivars showed an increase in the amounts of damaged starch and leaching proteins, lipids, and amylose with F/T cycles. The freezing-treated HWS exhibited a higher swelling power and peak, trough, breakdown and final viscosity than SWS after F/T treatment. The onset, peak and conclusion gelatinization temperatures and the enthalpy of the isolated HWS determined by differential scanning calorimetry, decreased throughout F/T cycles. Concomitantly, the bread containing freezing-treated HWS exhibited a lower bread specific volume and harder crumb firmness, which might be associated with its significant structural changes induced by F/T treatment.

AB The effects of thermal (pasteurization and sterilization) and non-thermal (ultrasound and plasma) processing on the composition of prebiotic and non-prebiotic acerola juices were evaluated using NMR and GC-MS coupled to chemometrics. The increase in the amount of Vitamin C was the main feature observed after thermal processing, followed by malic acid, choline, trigonelline, and acetaldehyde. On the other hand, thermal processing increased the amount of 2-furoic acid, a degradation product from ascorbic acid, as well as influenced the decrease in the amount of esters and alcohols. In general, the non-thermal processing did not present relevant effect on juices composition. The addition of prebiotics (inulin and gluco-oligosaccharides) decreased the effect of processing on juices composition, which suggested a protective effect by microencapsulation. Therefore, chemometric evaluation of the H-1 qNMR and GC-MS dataset was suitable to follow changes in acerola juice under different processing.

AB Changes in the structural properties of hydrogels made with gelatin and bovine serum albumin mixtures were recorded following exposure to high pressure at 300 MPa for 15 min at 10 and 80 degrees C. Dynamic oscillation, SEM, FTIR and blending law modelling were utilised to rationalise results. Pressurization at the low temperature end yielded continuous gelatin networks supporting discontinuous BSA inclusions, whereas an inverted dispersion was formed at the high temperature end with the continuous BSA network suspending the discontinuous gelatin inclusions. Lewis and Nielsen equations followed the mechanical properties of the composites thus arguing that solvent partition between the two phases was always in favour of the polymer forming the continuous network. As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to elucidate the solvent partition in pressurised hydrogel composites using blending law theory. Outcomes were contrasted with earlier work where binary mixtures were subjected only to thermal treatment.

AB This study evaluated the impact of thermal treatment on the degradation of carotenoids, flavonoids and ascorbic acid in juice of orange cv. Cara Cara. A total of 42 carotenoids were detected in the Cara Cara juice and the simulated system, and the newly formed compounds were identified as isomers derived from beta-cryptoxanthin, beta-carotene, lycopene, phytoene and phytofluene. During thermal treatment, carotenes of lycopene, phytoene and phytofluene were highly stabile in Cara Cara juice probably due to the matrix protection, while they decreased by 70.85%, 12.50% and 45.59% respectively in the simulated system following the first-order degradation reaction (k = 1.70 x 10(-3), 2.90 x 10(-4) and 6.28 x 10(-4)). Epoxy-carotenoid esters were sensitive to the low pH of the Cara Cara juice and esterified beta-cryptoxanthin was the only ester group survived by thermal treatment. Thermal degradations of total caotenoid, flavonoid and ascorbic acid in Cara Cara juice were fitted by bi-exponential function.

AB Abalone has been farmed commercially for the last few decades, and the breeding and economic value of abalone have gained extensive attention. In this study, the lipid profile of the foot muscles, viscera, and gonads of male and female Japanese abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino was explored using ultra performance liquid chromatography- electrospray ionization-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS), to discuss the effect of lipid composition on its nutritional value. Thirty-four species from ten lipid classes including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, triacylglycerol, steroids, terpenoids and fatty acids were annotated by MS-DIAL to obtain all fragment ions for precursors. Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) enriched in unsaturated fatty acids were the major components, which accounted for 52-57% of total lipids. Considering the high-level of GPLs, and their importance in maintaining the integrity and functionality of cell membranes, further utilization of inexpensive tissues, such as viscera and gonads is warranted.

AB A new biosensor for monitoring glucose levels in beverages is presented. The measurements are performed using potentiometric detection. Working electrodes are made using platinised paper as support and a biocompatible polymeric membrane made of a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol and chitosan containing glucose oxidase as the recognition layer. The system is based on the detection of the hydrogen peroxide generated by an enzymatic reaction performed in a highly sensitive, selective and simple way. The biosensors display suitable analytical performance (sensitivity -119.6 +/- 6.4 mV/dec in the 0.03-1.0 mM range with a limit of detection of 0.02 mM). Determination of glucose in commercial orange juices is presented. These results were validated against conventional standard methods, showing good accuracy and fast analytical response. The methodology presented herein does not require complex samples treatment, offering an alternative to conventional methods, particularly for determinations performed with minimal expertise and without a laboratory infrastructure.

AB This study aims at identifying the composition of polyphenols present in Amygdalus pedunculata Pall seed coat (APSC), and characterizing their antioxidant, antibacterial, and anticancer activities. The polyphenols from APSC were composed of 32 compounds. The compounds with important biological activities included apigenin 7-O-glucoside (the main component; 34.53 mg/100 g), quercitrin (23.43 mg/100 g), kaempferol (10.28 mg/100 g), naringenin (6.27 mg/100 g), cyanidin 3-rutinoside (5.76 mg/100 g), cyanidin 3-O-galactoside (5.19 mg/100 g), and quercetin (2.50 mg/100 g), as well as a variety of phenolic acids (gentisic acid, 23.13 mg/100 g; salicylic acid, 18.79 mg/100 g; gallic acid, 2.55 mg/100 g; etc.). Characterization of the identified polyphenols indicated that APSC possessed high antioxidant activity, due to its ability to reduce Fe3+ and scavenge ABTS, DPPH, OH center dot, O-2(center dot-), and H2O2 free radicals. The ability of APSC to reduce Fe3+ and scavenge ABTS radical, and H2O2 was stronger than that of control group ascorbic acid (Vc). The data from bacteriostatic test showed that polyphenols from APSC had good antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis, but showed no activity against Aspergillus niger. Cell viability assays using HepG2 cell illustrated that polyphenols from APSC significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. The findings demonstrate that polyphenols from APSC may be utilized as is or further developed into natural antioxidant, antibacterial, and anticancer agents. This work also provides a basis for the development and utilization of Amygdalus pedunculata Pall.

AB The aim of the present investigation was to study the in vitro mineral dialyzability of pasta made with white and whole-grain flours obtained from two genotypes (Klein Guerrero and Baguette Premium 11) with different mineral contents. Pasta samples were made from white flour (FP), and whole grain flour from cyclonic mill (WFAP) and blade mill (WFBP). Mineral content and in vitro digestion were determined on all samples to study starch variation and mineral dialyzability. Whole-grain pasta contained significantly higher amounts of minerals than FP, since bran and embryo are richer in minerals than endosperm. In addition to the low content of mineral composition observed in FP, the dialyzability of some minerals (Cu, Fe, Mg and Zn) was higher than whole-grain pasta even when the percentage of starch hydrolyzed after intestinal digestion was higher than FP. These results can also be useful for developing wheat-based products rich in the desired minerals.

AB We investigated the effects of jeotgal (fermented fish sauce) on kimchi fermentation, with or without saeu-jeot and myeolchi-jeot. Bacterial community analysis showed that Leuconostoc, Weissella, Lactobacillus, and Tetragenococcus were the dominant genera; however, their succession depended on the presence of jeotgal. Leuconostoc gasicomitatum was the dominant species in kimchi without jeotgal, whereas Weissella koreensis and Lactobacillus sakei were the dominant species in kimchi with myeolchi-jeot and saeu-jeot, respectively. Metabolite analysis, using H-1 NMR, showed that the amounts of amino acids and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were higher in kimchi with jeotgal. Increases in acetate, lactate, and mannitol contents depended on fructose consumption and were more rapid in kimchi with jeotgal. Moreover, the consumption of various amino acids affected the increase in kimchi LAB. Thus, the role of jeotgal in kimchi fermentation was related to enhancement of taste, the amino acid source, and the increases in levels of functional metabolites.

AB Capsaicinoids were extracted from a range of spices and chillies using methanol, prior to concentrating the compounds using solid-phase extraction cartridges and water/methanol (50:50% v/v) as the solvent, followed by elution with acetonitrile. The primary extraction procedure, involving only sonication of the spices in methanol, gave results comparable to a procedure that used a combination of sonication, stirring and centrifuging. The voltammetric quantification of the capsaicinoids, at approximately +0.5 V vs. ferrocene(0/+) that were transferred from methanol/water into acetonitrile/water via solid phase extraction, was carried out in micro-centrifuge tubes. Linear calibration curves for voltammetry measurements were obtained from low ppm up to at least 1400 ppm of capsaicinoids, with concentrations being detected in the different source extracts (paprika, tabasco sauce, cayenne pepper, and fresh chillies) from approximately 17 to 430 ppm, which corresponded to values of between approximately 130 and 4000 ppm, respectively, present in the original samples.

AB Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by filamentous-type fungi that contaminates a wide variety of foods and beverages such as wines. In these trials, we evaluated the capacity of the following polymers for the removal of OTA from acidic model solutions and red wine: polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP), resin of N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and triallyl isocyanurate (PVP-DEGMA-TAIC), and poly(acrylamide-co-ethylene glycol-dimethacrylate) (PA-EGDMA). In acidic model solution, PVP-DEGMA-TAIC and PA-EGDMA polymers removed up to 99.9% of OTA, but their trapping capacity was highly reduced by the presence of competing phenolic substances (i.e. gallic acid and 4-methylcathecol). In real red wine, PA-EGDMA polymer showed the most promising results, with more than 68.0% OTA removal and less than 14.0% reduction in total phenolic. Finally, computational chemistry analyses showed that the affinity between OTA and the polymers studied would be due to Van der Waals interactions.

AB Graphene-magnetite composite (G-Fe3O4) was successfully synthesized and applied as adsorbent for magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of two phenolic acids namely 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHB) from stingless bee honey prior to analysis using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet-visible detection (HPLC-UV/Vis). Several MSPE parameters affecting extraction of these two acids were optimized. Optimum MSPE conditions were 50 mg of G-Fe3O4 adsorbent, 5 min extraction time at 1600 rpm, 30 mL sample volume, sample solution pH 0.5, 200 mu L methanol as desorption solvent (5 min sonication assisted) and 5% w/v NaCl. The LODs (3 S/N) calculated for 4-HB and 3,4-DHB were 0.08 and 0.14 mu g/g, respectively. Good relative recoveries (72.6-110.6%) and reproducibility values (RSD < 8.5%, n= 9) were obtained. The developed G-Fe3O4 MSPE method offered is simple, easy, environmental friendly and efficient for extraction of the two phenolic acids from stingless bee honey samples.

AB The effects of rapid aging technology on aroma compounds and characteristic of white tea were investigated in comparison with natural aged white tea (NAWT) and fresh white tea (FWT). Volatile compounds of white teas were extracted using headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME), and analyzed with gas-chromato-graphy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with chemometrics. Aroma metabolites analysis showed that 40 compounds were identified to distinguish rapid aged white tea (RAWT) from others. Principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), heatmap analysis and Venn diagram demonstrated that alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, heterocyclics and alkanes exhibited significant variations. Quantitative descriptive analysis of white tea aroma showed that in RAWT, sweet and herbal aroma were significantly improved; whereas grassy green and delicate aroma declined sharply. This study provides a comprehensive investigation on aroma quality of RAWT, offering a potentially rapid way to produce aged white tea.

AB The goal of this study was to improve the chemical stability of menhaden oil and control the lipolysis in emulsions with whey protein during in vitro digestion through EGCG conjugation and genipin-mediated interfacial cross-linking (CL). WPI-EGCG conjugate was successfully synthesized, confirmed by SDS-PAGE, ESI-MS, and phenolic group quantifications (125.3 mg/g), and characterized with far UV CD and ATR-FTIR. Emulsion particle diameter with WPI-EGCG is lower than with WPI. Compared to the native emulsion, WPI CL increased particle diameter and physical stability. Higher oxidative stability was observed for emulsions stabilized with WPI-EGCG conjugate than that with interfacial cross-linking due to the great antioxidant activity. Whereas, WPI CL is more effective than WPI-EGCG conjugate in hindering the rate and extent of lipolysis. The combination of EGCG conjugation and interfacial CL showed both the highest protection of menhaden oil against degradation and highest inhibition on the rate and extent of lipolysis of menhaden oil.

AB Based on theoretical and mechanistical considerations, an equation is presented that describes the observed rate of a pH sensitive reaction. In contrast to the commonly used catalytic catenary, the new approach enables the calculation of non-biased thermodynamic activation parameters. Applying this model, the general acid/base catalysis of the ring opening of beta-D-fructopyranose was analyzed polarimetrically. Thereby, it could be shown that acids (bases) catalyze the ring opening of anionic (cationic) sugar species. Since anomerization rate constants correlate with the rate of sugar degradation, catalysts of anomerization will increase the sugars reactivity as well. The most effective catalysts of the ring opening of beta-D-fructopyranose in the food relevant pH milieu are weak acids and their conjugated bases. Consequently, the enhanced reactivity of reducing sugars in the presence of amino acids is not solely due to classical Maillard reaction but primarily due to carboxylic acid catalysis of degradation reactions.

AB Analyzing the H-1 NMR spectrum of D-glucose, the resonance frequencies of the anomeric protons of five D-glucose anomers could be determined in dependence on temperature. Besides, the relative concentrations of all cyclic D-glucose anomers could be quantified. Based on that, thermodynamic parameters were calculated. In addition, ring opening rate constants of all cyclic D-glucose anomers were measured for the first time using 1H selective blind saturation transfer NMR spectroscopy. The results presented here give rise to the assumption that furanoid anomers highly influence the reactivity of total D-glucose. Finally, the complex anomeric equilibration curves for a freshly prepared solution of crystalline alpha-D-glucopyranose are presented. Based on that, it is hypothesized that the reactivity of a solution of a reducing sugar in general and D-glucose in particular depends on time until the thermodynamic equilibrium state is reached.

AB The anti-allergenicity of phlorotannin-targeted extracts from four edible seaweed species of Fucus genus was evaluated herein for the first time. Extracts were able to act upon cellular events triggered by immunological reaction (IgE/antigen), and on cellular events downstream the Ca2+ influx caused by a chemical stimulus (calcium ionophore A23187), preventing degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells. Furthermore, a dose-dependent behaviour towards allergy-related enzymatic systems was observed for all the phlorotannin extracts. Linear correlations were found between reduction of the allergic mediators released and the total phlorotannin content, as well as between the enzyme inhibition and the amount of phlorotannins in the extracts. These results point to a multi-target anti-allergic capacity of phlorotannin-targeted extracts, which displayed effects on different critical steps of the allergic response, contributing to the valorisation of Fucus spp. both as food and for nutraceutical applications.

AB Bors is a traditional Romanian beverage obtained by naturally fermenting an aqueous suspension of wheat bran and corn flour, used as flavoring enhancer in local gastronomy since ancient times, and more recently consumed as refreshing drink. To investigate the changes in sensory, physico-chemical, phenolic and aroma composition resulted after two successive fermentations, bor. samples were subjected to standard, sensory, HPLC and GC/MS analysis. Total phenolic compounds and ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic compound, were positively influenced by natural starter addition, increase of fermentation temperature, and thermal treatment, whereas the effect on less abundant phenolic acids was not univocal. The variables had the same effect on antioxidant activity and brown index. Volatiles (alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters), pungent-sour and goat milk-cheese odor notes increased at higher fermentation temperature, whereas bran and yogurt odor notes decreased. The addition of a natural starter at 4 degrees C allowed balancing odor intensity and antioxidant activity.

AB Eleven compounds were identified during profiling of polyphenols by UPLC-QTOF/MS. In abundance was quercetin-3-O-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside in M. malabathricum ethanolic leaves extract while 6-hydroxykaempferol-3-O-glucoside was present in the leaves extract of M. decenfidum (its rare variety). TPC and TFC were significantly higher in M. decemfidum extract than M. malabathricum extract. During DPPH, FRAF and beta-carotene bleaching assays, M. decemfidum extract exhibited greater antioxidant activity compared to M. malabathricum extract. Effect of M. malabathricum and M. decemfidum extracts on viability of MDA-MB-231 cell at concentrations 6.25-100 mu g/mL were evaluated for 24, 48 and 72 h. After 48 and 72 h treatment, M. malabathricum and M. decemfidum leaves extracts exhibited significant activity in inhibiting MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line with M. malabathricum extract being more cytotoxic. M. malabathricum and M. imbricatum serves as potential daily dietary source of natural phenolics and to improve chemotherapeutic effectiveness.

AB Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) is rich in polyphenols which are known to be protective agents against several diseases. Polyphenols are highly sensitive against temperature, pH, oxygen, and light conditions, leading to low bioaccessibility. In this study, polyphenols of sour cherry concentrate (SCC) were encapsulated by uniaxial or coaxial electrospinning with gelatin or gelatin-lactalbumin. Results showed that phenolic acids had higher encapsulation efficiencies than anthocyanins. Encapsulation efficiencies were found as 89.7 and 91.3% in terms of phenolic acids and 70.3 and 77.8% in terms of flavonoids for the uniaxially electrospun samples with gelatin and gelatin-lactalbumin, respectively. The content of polyphenols in SCC decreased after intestinal tract whereas all electrospun samples showed improved bioaccessibility. According to in vitro digestion results, electrospinning encapsulation provided 8 times better protection of cyanidin-3-glucoside compared to the non-encapsulated SCC. Results showed that especially coaxial electrospinning encapsulation is an effective method for sour cherry polyphenols.

AB Two types of chicken broth, broiler broth (BB) and native chicken broth (NCB), were used to analyse their differences in aroma by gas chromatography-olfactometry/mass spectrometry (GC-O/MS). NCB contained more complex volatiles and exhibited a richer aromatic profile compared with BB. Results from aroma extract dilution analysis showed that (E,E)-2,4-decadienal was the odorant with highest flavour dilution (FD) factor in both broths. The FD factors of 10 odorants in NCB were greater than those in BB, and 13 odorants with almond, citrus, vegetable, cucumber and sweet smells were only found in NCB. Moreover, 16 aroma compounds had average odor activity values (OAVs) greater than 1, among which (E,Z)-2,4-decadienal (OAV(BB) = 181, OAV(NCB) = 1067), (E, E)-2,4-decadienal (OAV(BB) = 175, OAV(NCB) = 1065), (E, E)-2,4-nonadienal (OAV(BB) = 28, OAV(NCB) = 169), and (E)-2-nonenal (OAV(BB) = 39, OAV(NCB) = 120) exhibited the highest values. Omission tests corroborated the importance of dienals to the overall aroma of chicken broth; nevertheless, omitting either (E, E)-2,4-decadienal or (E, E)-2,4-nonadienal individually did not result in significant aroma change.

AB A new ionic liquid functionalized graphene-pipette-tip solid-phase extraction method coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography was established for the simultaneous extraction and determination of three auxins in soybean sprouts. The graphene adsorbent, with multiple adsorption mechanisms, was first synthesized by functional modification of pentafluorobenzyl imidazolium bromide ionic liquid through thiol-ene click chemistry. The ionic liquid was applied to prevent the aggregation of graphene; it also imbued graphene with the ability for p-p interactions, ionic exchange, electrostatic interactions, as well as hydrogen bonding (which is stronger than the interaction between water and analytes), by augmenting the adsorption mechanisms between the adsorbent and analytes. Under optimized conditions, linearity was achieved in the ranges 0.03-5.00 mu g/g for indole-3-acetic acid and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 0.09-5.00 mu g/g for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, with a detection limit of 0.004-0.026 mu g/g; this adsorbent has been successfully applied for the determination of auxins in soybean sprouts.

The proximate composition showed appreciable levels of protein (39.5 g.100 g(-1)), carbohydrates (44.74 g.100 g(-1)), total fiber (34.47 g.100 g(-1)), soluble fiber (22.65 g.100 g(-1)), insoluble fiber (11.81 g.100 g(-1)), ash (13.81 g.100 g(-1)), and low lipid contents (2.47 g.100 g(-1)). No cyanogenic compounds were detected in both samples. Freeze-drying stood out as the method that led to the greatest reductions of the bioactive compounds (33.12-73.86%, dry basis) and antioxidant capacity when compared to the leaves in natura. Microwave drying was the preservation method that produced dry leaves with higher content of bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity. Therefore, microwave drying produced dehydrated Curcuma longa L. leaves with the highest bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity.

AB Although the enantiomeric distribution of chiral volatiles presents great potential in discrimination of tea cultivars and their geographic origins, this area has received little attention. Thus, we herein aimed to determine the relationships between tea cultivars and the enantiomeric distributions of their chiral volatile constituents. Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and enantioselective gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Es-GC-MS) were employed to quantify 15 volatile components in 22 tea cultivars from different locations within China. The tea cultivars were successfully differentiated by their geographical origins, and the concentrations of R-linalool, S-citronellol, S-E-nerolidol, (1R, 2R)-methyl jasmonate, S-a-ionone, and the two enantiomers of linalool oxide A differed significantly among the different groups. It should also be noted that tea processing methods greatly influenced the formation of volatile enantiomers. Our results demonstrated that the enantiomeric distribution of volatile constituents closely correlates with the geographical origins, leaf types, and manufacturing suitabilities of the tea cultivars examined herein.

AB Cold pressed parsley seed oil gained special interest for the development of new functional foods. Similar to other edible oils it needs protection against oxidation. The present study evaluated the protective effects of anthocyanins extracted from outer skins of red onion on parsley seed oil.
   The natural extract-oil samples and control have been subjected to storage at 45 degrees C for 10 days. The results of thermal analysis by DSC showed an optimal concentration of anthocyanins of 3 mL/100 g oil. Kinetic studies using the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose methods were performed on the sample optimally prepared. The results regarding the activation energy indicated improved stability of parsley seed oil in the presence of anthocyanins. The kinetic studies based on peroxide values also suggested the protective role of red onion anthocyanins.
   The results are important for the development of natural alternatives useful for the inhibition of oxidation in parsley seed oil.

AB The roles of water in the mantle transition zone, lower mantle, and the core-mantle boundary are investigated. The evidence for a wet mantle transition zone has been suggested based on hydrous mineral inclusions in diamond. Seismic wave velocity and electrical conductivity profiles together with mineral physics data are consistent with existence of stagnant slabs in a wet mantle transition zone. The transition zone may contain continental crustal components in these stagnant slabs. Dense hydrous magmas may exist at the base of the upper mantle. Fluids or volatile-rich magmas may also exist at the top of the lower mantle due to the large contrast in water contents between the mineral assemblages in the mantle transition zone and the lower mantle, and the crossing of the convective descent of the cold hydrated materials. Dense magmas are not likely to be formed at the top of the lower mantle and hydrous magmas generated in this region move upwards and metasomatize the overlying mantle transition zone. Water can be transported deeper into the lower mantle by gravitational collapse of the stagnant slabs, which supply water into the lower mantle, including the core-mantle boundary. Hydrous delta-H solid solution may be the most important hydrous phase in lower mantle, and existence of this phase reduces the aluminum content in coexisting bridgmanite and post-perovskite, and thus modifies the physical properties of the lower mantle. Hydrous delta-H solid solution can accumulate at the base of the lower mantle. The iron-water reaction at the core-mantle boundary can also create pyrite-type FeOOH which can be a potential candidate material for the ultralow velocity zone (ULVZ).

AB The Upper Paleozoic sedimentary sequence in the Beishan Region, northwest China, provides a complete record of the complex amalgamation and extension history of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) for this part of China. Integrating newly obtained stratigraphic, paleontological and radiometric data, this paper reviews the Upper Paleozoic stratigraphic sequences of the Beishan Region. The Upper Paleozoic strata here are divided into three megasequences (MS). They are, in ascending order: Devonian, Mississippian-Guadalupian and Lopingian megasequences (MS1, MS2, and MS3), separated by two major unconformities each indicative of a huge sedimentary hiatus. MS1 is made up of continental and epicontinental marine deposits in the pre-rift stage; MS2 of transgressive marine and volcanic strata in the syn-rift stage; and MS3 of continental sediments in the inversion stage. The major unconformity between MS1 and MS2 is interpreted to represent the regional uplift and erosion caused by the final amalgamation of CAOB in the Beishan Region. The syn-rift MS2 represented by transgressive marine and volcanic strata in the Beishan Region can be well-correlated with Pennsylvanian-Guadalupian megasequences in Inner Mongolia, where they rest on a major interregional unconformity. This correlation suggests the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in Beishan and Inner Mongolia before the Carboniferous, followed by the development of a synchronous marine rift megasequence in the southern part of the CAOB.

AB We present the detailed mineralogical, geochemical (major and trace element), bulk Nd and Sr and mineral 0 isotope data for eclogites, associated orthogneisses and metasedimentary rocks from the recently discovered eclogite-bearing complex of the Zamtyn-Nuruu range (SW Mongolia). Trace element studies reveal the enrichment of eclogites with LILE and LREE relative to typical mid-ocean ridge basalts at similar levels of HREE and HFSE but without a clear arc-derived Nb minimum. The eclogites have relatively narrow range of mostly radiogenic epsilon Nd(T) values (+2.3 to +3.7 as back-calculated for 550 Ma) and model age T-DM of 1.47-1.77 Ga at a wide range of initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio due to variable LILE mobilization in pre- or synmetamorphic processes. The geochemical and isotope data indicate the variably enriched MORE-like protolith for eclogites that have their variable composition through differentiation of precursor melts, slightly enriched mantle source and/or variable degree of crustal contamination. The mostly siliciclastic eclogite-hosting metasediments are likely derived from the intra-continental riftogenic basin, whereas the medium-pressure metapelites of the Maykhan Tsakhir formation originate from deeper passive margin sedimentation. Their Mesoproterozoic two-stage model age TDM-2ST of 1.49-1.63 Ga and crustal epsilon Nd(T) values (-3.5 to -5.3) significantly differ from the Zamtyn Nuruu complex rocks and indicate a mixed Nd source likely resembled from the juvenile Neoproteorozoic magmatism with depleted Nd signatures and the older Meso- or Paleoproterozoic crustal substrate. Contrastingly, eclogite-hosting gneisses exhibit the epsilon Nd(T) of the ancient crust (-12.9) and Paleoproterozoic model age TDM-2ST of 2.22 Ga. Both eclogites and metasediments evidently exhibit an input from the ancient crustal source that may be represented by orthogneisses of the Alag Khadny complex. Oxygen isotope data (delta O-18 of garnets mostly within +5.5 to +6.6) at high Fe3+ /Sigma Fe ratio of bulk rocks (0.15-0.21) indicate variable but mostly limited interaction of precursor rocks with oceanic water, degassing at shallow crustal level or at the surface or relatively more oxidized (back-arc or subarc) mantle source. Considering the limited trace element evidence for the input from continental crust, generally elevated Fe3+ /Sigma Fe for samples showing different retrograde alteration degrees, and no or limited delta O-18 evidence of pre-metamorphic interaction with oceanic water, we may suggest that primitive low-K tholeitic basalts close to T-MORB tholeites derived from a heterogeneously enriched mantle source of a rifted continental margin as precursor rocks for the studied eclogites. As a consequence of the geological structure and geochemical evidence, connection of rifting to the Rodinia break-up is proposed.

AB The tectonic evolution of the Xing'an-Inner Mongolia Orogenic Belt (XIMOB) in the southeastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt is not well understood. It is arguable whether the Paleo-Asian Ocean was closed in Devonian or Early Mesozoic and whether the tectonic regimes during Carboniferous and Permian were operated by continuous subduction-arc systems or extension after the orogenic process. Comprehensive studies of metamorphism for four metamorphic terranes including the Ondor Sum Group, Baoyintu Group, Xilingol Complex, and early Triassic metamorphic sequences in central Inner Mongolia provide good constraints on the arguable issues about the XIMOB. According to the zircon U-Pb dating analyses in this study, quartz schists of the Ondor Sum Group in the northern and southern orogenic belts (NOB and SOB) have a broad detrital zircon age range from late Archean to early Paleozoic with a similar youngest deposition age of 434-430 Ma, but have different zircon age populations with a similar to 650 Ma peak for the NOB but not for the SOB. Biotite gneisses of the Xilingol Complex have age populations and the youngest deposition age of 436 Ma similar to the Ondor Sum Group in the NOB. Amphibolites in the complex have a metamorphic zircon age of 321 +/- 3 Ma and hornblende Ar-40/Ar-39 age of 309 +/- 2 Ma. The early Triassic metamorphic sequences, metabasites in Wulangou and mica-schists in Shuangjing both have broad zircon age ranges from the late Archean to late Paleozoic. Their protoliths are constrained to have formed later than 258 Ma and 261 Ma respectively and the metamorphism occurred soon afterwards in the Early Triassic constrained by an actinolite Ar-40-Ar-39 age of 241 +/- 19 Ma in metabasite and a muscovite Ar-40-Ar-39 age of 240 +/- 2 Ma in mica-schist. Combined with the results previously published, this study identified four phases of metamorphism in central Inner Mongolia since Paleozoic. The Silurian (430-426 Ma) high P/T metamorphism of the Ondor Sum Group was related to bidirectional subduction processes. The Devonian (similar to 400 Ma) medium P/T metamorphism of the Baoyintu Group suggests a crustal thickening orogeny. The Carboniferous (337-321 Ma) low P/T metamorphism of the Xilingol Complex is indicative of an extension process of a previous orogen. The Early Triassic (similar to 240 Ma) extensive medium-low P/T metamorphism along the Solonker suture zone was attributed to the closure of limited ocean basins. Thus, an alternative tectonic scenario for the metamorphic terranes in central Inner Mongolia involves: (i) the early Paleozoic trench-arc system (500-425 Ma); (ii) the Devonian collisional orogeny due to closure of the Paleo-Asian-Ocean (400-360 Ma); (iii) the Carboniferous and Permian extension after the collision (350-250 Ma), and (iv) the Early Triassic within-plate orogeny due to the closure of limited ocean basins (similar to 240 Ma).

AB The Xing'an-Inner Mongolia accretionary belt in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) was produced by the subduction of three oceanic plates: the Paleo-Asian, Mongol-Okhotsk and Paleo-Pacific oceanic plates. The interactions between these plates remain unclear. Here we report an Alaskan-type ultramafic-mafic intrusion in the Kedanshan area, central Inner Mongolia, China. The main lithologies of this intrusion include cumulate dunite, pyroxene peridotite, olivine pyroxenite and cumulate gabbro, with late gabbroic/anorthositic dykes. Minerals and whole-rock compositional variations display characteristics of an arc cumulate trend (Alaskan type), through fractional crystallization of Mg-rich and hydrous basaltic magma associated with oceanic subduction. Zircons from two gabbro samples yield Early Jurassic ages of 193 +/- 6 Ma and 179 +/- 4 Ma, respectively. We conclude that this ultramafic-mafic complex is an accumulated intrusion from an arc-related, high-Mg magma chamber above a supra-subduction zone. Considering the ages, location and tectonic setting of the complex, we suggest that it was most likely generated by melting of a large and triangle-shaped mantle wedge during superimposed subduction between the Mongol-Okhotsk and the Paleo-Pacific oceanic plates in the Jurassic.

AB Central Inner Mongolia is located in the southeastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), and controversy has long surrounded its late Paleozoic tectonic evolution. Here, we present an integrated study of zircon U-Pb ages, whole rock major and trace elements, and zircon Hf isotopes for five less studied alkali feldspar granitic plutons in the Dongwuqi area to the north of the Erenhot-Hegenshan-Heihe suture zone. Zircon U-Pb dating by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) indicates that these granitic plutons were emplaced in the Late Carboniferous (315-300 Ma). The Late Carboniferous alkali feldspar granites belong to high-K calc-alkaline series and are evolved I-type granites. They are high in SiO2 (73.22-77.36%), and low in MgO (0.07-0.49%) with enrichments in light rare earth elements (LREEs), Zr, Hf, Rb, Th, and U, and depletions in Ba, Nb, Ta, Sr, and Eu. The Dongwuqi granitic rocks are characterized by high positive zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+7.6 to +15.1), and relatively young two-stage Hf model (T-DM2) ages (364-835 Ma). These geochemical data, together the common miarolitic texture, indicate that they were derived from partial melting of juvenile arc-related mafic to intermediate rocks in the lower crust, and eventually emplaced in low-pressure conditions or at shallow crustal levels, with involvement of extensive fractional crystallization during magma evolution. Our new results, along with the published regional data, delineate a NE-trending Carboniferous continental arc belt (more than 1700 km) in the northern accretionary zone of the Erenhot-Hegenshan-Heihe suture. Accordingly, we invoke that the Dongwuqi Late Carboniferous high-K granites were emplaced in an active continental margin setting, which was probably related to the northwestward subduction of the Hegenshan oceanic plate beneath the Xing'an-Uliastai-Nuhetdavaa block.

AB This study presents new whole-rock geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic data, together with zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotope ratios, of granitic rocks and associated dikes from the Okhotsk and Aniva plutons in South Sakhalin. The two plutons emplaced in the Mid-Eocene show markedly contrasting geochemical characteristics. The Okhotsk granites (44-42 Ma) are mildly peraluminous (A/CNK = 1.02-1.08), ferroan and alkali-calcic, and have transitional I- and A-type granite features. This granite suite contains rare inherited zircons. The Aniva granites (40 Ma) are peraluminous (A/CNK = 1.08-1.21), magnesian and calc-alkaline, typical of S-type features. This suite, essentially biotite-cordierite bearing, has abundant inherited zircons dated from 48 to 2446 Ma. Whole rock Sr-Nd and zircon Hf isotopic data indicate that the genesis of the two plutons involved partial melting of mixed sources with dominant juvenile crustal components (newly accreted accretionary complexes or newly underplated basaltic materials) and magma mixing between underplated mantle-derived magmas and crustal partial melts. The Okhotsk granites have epsilon Nd (T) values of + 3.1 to + 3.7, initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.7047-0.7048, and zircon epsilon Hf (T) values of + 11 to + 16. The Aniva granites have epsilon Nd (T) values of +0.5 to +0.9 and initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.7052 to 0.7055, and zircon epsilon Hf (T) values of +4 to +12. According to Sr-Nd and Nd-Hf isotopic mixing calculations, the proportion of the juvenile component (=mantle-derived materials) is estimated to be > 70%, and that of the upper crust component is less than 30% in the sources of the Okhotsk and Aniva plutons. We further argue that, based on Nd and Hf isotopic constraints, the Okhotsk and Aniva granites are correlated to the Mid-Eocene granites in the western and eastern parts, respectively, of the Hidaka terrane in Hokkaido. From the Sikhote-Alin area to the Sakhalin and Hokkaido Islands, the increase in juvenile sources and the decrease in recycled crustal materials are exhibited in the Nd isotopic signatures of the granitoids from early Cretaceous to Miocene. The granitic magmatism in South Sakhalin and Hokkaido may be the most prominent example of juvenile crustal growth among these areas.

AB The Akiyoshi Belt in the Inner Zone of Southwest Japan is made up of a Permian accretionary complex, the main component of which is the Late Permian Nishiki Group that mainly consists of sandstone, mudstone, felsic tuff and a minor amount of chert and conglomerate. We employ multiple methods, which includes sandstone petrography, detrital garnet composition and detrital zircon U-Pb dating to investigate the likely sources of these terrigenous deposits and to reconstruct the paleogeographic link between the proto-Japan and the East Asian continent. The highly immature Late Permian sandstones are interpreted to derive from multi-type source rocks that include felsic igneous rocks, basalts, sedimentary rocks and low to medium-grade metamorphic rocks in proximal locations. The detrital zircon U-Pb results show that all samples contain a dominant Early to Late Permian zircon population (294-254 Ma) and these zircons are interpreted to be derived from an active volcanic arc, which was most likely caused by subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate beneath the South China Block. We found that spessartine-rich almandine garnets and almandine garnets dominated assemblages in the lower unit changed to grossular-andradite garnets dominated assemblage in the upper unit, which was caused by a progressive uplifting and denudation of the Permian volcanic arc.

AB The Longmu Co-Shuanghu suture zone in central Qiangtang, northern Tibetan plateau, is a segment of the main suture zone of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. Numerous studies have focused on ophiolite and high-pressure metamorphic rocks from this suture zone, whereas the associated subduction-related magmatic rocks have received little attention. In this study, we present new data for the Late Paleozoic granitoids from the Gangma Co, Guoganjianian and Chasum areas along the Longmu Co-Shuanghu suture zone. Zircon U-Pb dating indicates that these granitic rocks were emplaced between 364 Ma and 346 Ma (Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous). Three granitic plutons exhibit different geochemical compositions, but show uniform Sr-Nd and zircon Hf isotopic features with positive epsilon(Nd)(T) and zircon epsilon(Hf)(T) values. Furthermore, these rocks were all formed in a volcanic arc setting associated with an oceanic subduction zone. Together with data from coeval volcanic rocks, we suggest that the Late Paleozoic magmatic rocks were formed as a result of northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. Subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean probably commenced in the Late Devonian, continued throughout the Late Paleozoic, and ended in the Triassic.

AB The Khondalite Belt is located in the northwestern North China Craton and contains late Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks that generally underwent high-grade metamorphism. Only a few supracrustal sequences experienced low-grade metamorphism such as the Meidaizhao sequence in the Daqingshan area. The Erdaowa sequence north of Hohhot City, Inner Mongolia, is another late Paleoproterozoic supracrustal unit showing relatively low-grade metamorphism compared with the adjacent metapelitic khondalites. It is composed of metavolcanic as well as clastic metasedimentary rocks and marble. It was traditionally subdivided into the Halaqin and Hongshangou Formations. We undertook an integrated study of U-Pb zircon dating and O-Hf isotopic analysis, combined with whole -rock chemistry, on metasedimentary rocks of the Erdaowa sequence in order to understand the relationship between the low- and high-grade rocks and their tectono-thermal history in the Khondalite Belt. Cores and metamorphic domains of detrital zircons from a two-mica schist of the Halaqin Formation have Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 2.0 and 1.86 Ga, delta(18) values of 6.69-9.45 parts per thousand and 6.68-12.15 parts per thousand, and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of + 7.7 to +16.2 and +3.3 to +20.9, respectively. A recrystallized core, fir-tree domain and altered domain of zircon from a Grt-St-Ky two-mica gneiss have Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of > 2.0 Ga, 1.88 Ga and 1.86 Ga, delta(18) values of 12.10-12.75 parts per thousand, 11.57-12.65%o and 11.57-12.27 parts per thousand, and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of + 0.7 to + 5.4, 2.0 to +4.7 and 2.0 to +0.5, respectively. These data limit the time of deposition of the sedimentary rocks between 2.0 and 1.88 Ga and show a high maturity, similar to khondalites of the same sequence. Compared with previous studies, we infer that the Erdaowa sequence consists of rocks of different origins and metamorphic grades (including khondalites), which were brought up to the same crustal level as tectonic slices due to late Paleoproterozoic tectonic processes.

AB Typical Proterozoic rapakivi granite of the Northern Hemisphere occur in Precambrian shield areas, and are commonly associated with anorthosites, mangerites, and charnockites, thus belonging to the AMCG (anorthosite-mangerite-charnocidte-granite) suite. A similar suite is represented in the North China Craton (NCC) by the Shachang rapalcivi granite and Damiao anorthosite complexes. The Shachang complex consists of amphibole-biotite rapakivi granite, porphyritic biotite granite, coarse-grained biotite granite, medium-to fine-grained biotite granite, and two-mica granite (listed from the earliest to the latest phases). New zircon U-Pb dating shows that the complex was formed over the period 1700-1682 Ma. The mafic minerals of the complex are calcic amphibole (ferroedenite-ferrohastingsite) and biotite (annite-siderophyllite), and the compositions of the amphibole suggest that the matrix of the amphibole-biotite rapakivi granite crystallized at a pressure of similar to 4 kbar. The temperatures of crystallization, obtained from the compositions of amphibole, biotite, and zircon, decreased from similar to 780 degrees C for the amphibole-biotite rapakivi granite to similar to 660 degrees C for the two-mica granite. Our study of the Shachang complex indicates an evolution from early potassium-rich magmas to late silicon-rich magmas. The early amphibole-biotite rapakivi granite crystallized under relatively high temperatures (760-780 degrees C) and low fO(2), while the later rocks formed under lower temperatures (760-660 degrees C) and high fO(2). The Shachang rapakivi granite and Damiao anorthosite complexes contain different mafic minerals and show diverse trace element ratios and disparate geochemical evolutionary trends, suggesting different sources. Zircon Lu-Hf and whole-rock Sin-Nd isotopic data for the Shachang complex are relatively homogeneous, with epsilon(Hf)(t) and epsilon(Nd)(t) values varying from -9.8 to -3.3 and -6.4 to -3.4, respectively. Corresponding two-stage Hf model ages and Nd depleted mantle model ages vary from 2650 to 2850 Ma and from 2480 to 2840 Ma, respectively. These model ages are similar to the ages of Neoarchean lower crustal metamorphic rocks in the NCC (2500-2800 Ma). In addition, the compositions of the amphiboles and biotites in the granite in the Shachang complex indicate derivation from the crust. All the evidence points to the Shachang rapakivi granite complex having been formed from magmas derived from the lower crust of the NCC, rather than from the fractionation of mantle-derived mafic magmas with minor crustal contamination. This paper provides a detailed case study of the Shachang complex that will further our understanding of the sources of Proterozoic rapakivi granite in the Northern Hemisphere that belong to the AMCG suite of rocks.

AB Late Mesozoic magmatic rocks are widely distributed in southern Anhui province, and are represented by the Qingyang-Jiuhuashan granitic complex, which consists dominantly of the Qingyang pluton of granodiorite and monzogranite, and the Jiuhuashan pluton of K-feldspar granite. These two plutons have zircon U-Pb ages of 138 Ma-128 Ma. Combining the new data with previously reported age data, the magmatism in southern Anhui province can be subdivided into three stages: early stage of similar to 152-136 Ma, middle stage of similar to 136-130 Ma, and latest stage of similar to 130-120 Ma. Granodiorite (early stage) and monzogranite (middle stage) of the Qingyang pluton have SiO2 contents of 66-68 wt%, total alkali contents of 7.5-8.6 wt%, K2O/Na2O ratios of 1.1-1.3, A/CNK ratios of 0.9-1.1, and low FeOT/(FeOT + MgO) values of 0.71-0.73. These rocks show depletion in Nb, Ta, and Zr and slightly negative Eu anomalies. K-feldspar granite (late stage) of the Jiuhuashan pluton is characterized by high SiO2 contents (> 75 wt%), K2O/Na2O ratios of 1.1-1.3, and A/CNK ratios of 0.9-1.2, and high FeOT/(FeOT + MgO) values of 0.88-0.93. They have high concentrations of Nb, Ta, and Zr, and strongly negative Eu anomalies. Initial epsilon(Hf) values of zircon grains from the granodiorite and monzogranite range from - 8.01 to -6.71 and -11.40 to - 9.43, with 8180 values varying from 7.16 parts per thousand to 8.04 parts per thousand and 7.26 parts per thousand to 8.06 parts per thousand, respectively. Zircon grains from K-feldspar granites have relatively high initial epsilon(Hf) values of -7.62 to -4.78, but similar 8180 values of 7.03-8.84 parts per thousand. Geochemical features of granodiorite and monzogranite point to an I-type signature, whereas those of K-feldspar granite show an A-type affinity. We propose that the granodiorite and monzogranite originated from mixing melts produced by partial melting of lithospheric mantle metasomatized by fluids and crustal rocks induced by underplating basaltic magmas, related to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific oceanic crust, whereas the K-feldspar granite formed from crustal anatexis in an extension setting caused by rollback of the subduction.

AB The origins of the Mesozoic low-delta O-18 A-type granites in eastern China are quite controversial. A new "low-delta O-18" granite, the Taohuadao alkaline (A(1)-type) granite from the Zhoushan archipelago, offshore from Zhejiang, is reported in this study. Integrated in situ analyses of Hf-O-Li isotopes in zircon are used to provide insights on the petrogenesis and evolution of this granite, and low-delta O-18 granites in general. Three types of zircon have been recognized in Taohuadao samples: zircon with sector/oscillatary zoning (Type 1), disturbed zoning (Type 2) and extremely high-U (Type 3) grains. Data are carefully screened for radiation damage and post-magmatic alteration and only Type 1 zircon represents a magmatic origin. In Type 1 zircons, Type la with normal mantle delta O-18(zrn) value of 5.23 parts per thousand has a positive delta Li-7 value (2.0 +/- 3.3 parts per thousand), while Type 1b has a delta O-18 value of similar to 4.81 parts per thousand and highly variable negative delta Li-7 values (-31.9 parts per thousand to -0.3 parts per thousand). In contrast to the O-Li isotopes, zircon is quite homogeneous in terms of Hf isotopes (epsilon Hf-(t) = - 3.5 +/- 1.7), suggesting that the Taohuadao A(1)-type granites were derived from a simple source. Our results show that the magmatic zircon delta O-18(zrn) values are negatively correlated with Hf content but positively correlated with Zr/Hf ratio in zircon, which indicates that fractional crystallization plays an important role in producing the slightly low delta O-18 signature. The anhydrous nature of the As-type granites suppressed the crystallization of biotite and hornblende, while low oxygen fugacity is responsible for insufficient precipitation of magnetite, both of which drive the later differentiates towards slight depletion in O-18. Therefore, we suggest a ferrogabbro-type fractional crystallization may have played a major role in producing the chemical and oxygen isotopic variations of the Taohuadao A(1)-type granite and accounts for similar to 0.50 parts per thousand O-18-depletion. The extremely depleted delta Li-7 in Type 1b zircons is most likely a result of diffusion-driven fractionation. Mantle-like O-Li isotopes and very low Li abundance in zircon suggest a predominantly mantle origin with little, if any, involvement of continental crustal materials in the granite. Thus the Taohuadao A(1)-type granite was most likely produced by intensive fractionation of reduced, anhydrous basaltic melts, rather than by mixing of mantle- and crustally-derived melts as previously thought.

AB The initiation and duration of magmatism in the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG), likely resulting from extensional collapse of the northern Taiwan mountain belt, remains an important issue of debates in the Taiwan orogeny. Here we report a detailed study of U-Pb ages determined by SIMS and LA-ICPMS, together with Hf isotopic data, of zircon separates from a total of 22 extrusive rocks from the TVG lava flow and additional two andesites from Keelungyu (KLY), a volcanic islet off NE Taiwan. Magmatic zircons from the TVG are characterized by uniform and high Hf isotopic ratios, with epsilon(Hf)(T) mostly from +20 to +10. Their overall Pb-206/U-238 ages suggest that the TVG magmatism was initiated similar to 3 Ma but more active <= 0.8 Ma with a flare up <= 0.35 Ma. Magmatic zircons from the two KLY samples reveal identical Pb-206/U-238 ages (0.41 Ma), coupled with Hf isotopes [epsilon(Hf)(T): +25 to +9] comparable to those of the TVG. Thus, KLY is proposed as part of the TVG. Consequently, we argue that the main body of the TVG formed <= 0.8 Ma by post-collisional volcanism, but the mechanism resulting in the magmatic episodes >= 1.0 Ma remains obscure due to the scarcity of rock exposures.

AB Resolved measurements of the relative abundances of (CDH3)-C-13 and (CD2H2)-C-12 from a Taiwan mud volcano confirm that thermogenic CH4 with a formation temperature of 150 degrees C is bubbling from a pool of liquid mud. Analysis for both doubly-substituted molecules provides confirmation that isotopic exchange equilibrium was achieved between methane isotopologues. Methane extracted from the headspace of core samples taken from sediments deposited proximal to the bubbling pool of mud shows small departures from isotopic equilibrium.

AB Non-gradient topology optimization aims to utilize soft computing approaches to approximate the optimal material distribution inside a predefined design domain of a structure. Although these approaches have the advantage of solving problems without a need for calculating gradients or sensitivities, they are associated with the drawback of coarse meshing or a limitation over the design domain. In this paper, we demonstrate how the derivative-free level-set method can eliminate this drawback without scarifying the quality of obtained topologies. We solved three benchmark numerical experiments at different levels of fine meshing. Additionally, the topological attainability is explored using image processing and models of physical problems of structural compliance, heat transfer and composite structures. The obtained results were compared to those by gradient methods. The results indicate that the proposed derivative-free level-set method can make the number of decision variables independent of the meshing level, but the level of attainable topological features. They demonstrate that the proposed approach can attain complex topological details using small numbers of decision variables at relatively low computational costs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Shape optimization in unsteady flow problems enables the consideration of dynamic effects on design. The ability to treat unsteady effects is attractive, as it can provide performance gains when compared to steady-state design methods for a variety of applications in which time-varying flows are of paramount importance. This is the case, for example, in turbomachinery or rotorcraft design. Given the high computational cost involved in time-accurate design problems, adjoint-based shape optimization is a promising option. However, efficient sensitivity analysis should also be accompanied by a significant decrease in computational cost for the primal flow solution, as well. Reduced-order models, like those based on the harmonic balance concept, in combination with the calculation of gradients via adjoint methods, are proposed for the efficient solution of a certain class of aerodynamics optimization problems. The harmonic balance method is applicable if the flow is characterized by discrete finite dominant flow frequencies that do not need to be integer multiples of a fundamental harmonic. A fully-turbulent harmonic balance discrete adjoint formulation based on a duality-preserving approach is proposed. The method is implemented by leveraging algorithmic differentiation and is applied to two test cases: the constrained shape optimization of both a pitching airfoil and a turbine cascade. A key advantage of the current approach is the accurate computation of gradients as compared to second order finite differences without any approximation in the linearization of the turbulent viscosity. The shape optimization results show significant improvements for the selected time-dependent objective functions, demonstrating that design problems involving almost-periodic unsteady flows can be tackled with manageable computational effort.

AB A parallel implementation of coupled spin-lattice dynamics in the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package is presented. The approach is very general, and can be applied to simple ferromagnets, magnetic alloys, or amorphous magnetic materials. Equations of motion for both spin only and coupled spin-lattice dynamics are first reviewed, including a detailed account of how magneto-mechanical potentials can be used to perform a proper coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. A symplectic numerical integration algorithm is then presented which combines the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for non-commuting variables and conserves the geometric properties of the equations of motion. The numerical accuracy of the serial implementation was assessed by verifying that it conserves the total energy and the norm of the total magnetization up to second order in the timestep size. Finally, a very general parallel algorithm is proposed that allows large spin-lattice systems to be efficiently simulated on large numbers of processors without degrading its mathematical accuracy. Its correctness as well as scaling efficiency were tested for realistic coupled spin-lattice systems, confirming that the new parallel algorithm is both accurate and efficient.

AB A Monte Carlo fluence estimator has been designed to take advantage of the computational power of graphical processing units (GPUs). This new estimator, termed the volumetric-ray-casting estimator, is an extension of the expectation estimator. It can be used as a replacement of the track-length estimator for the estimation of global fluence. Calculations for this estimator are performed on the GPU while the Monte Carlo random walk is performed on the central processing unit (CPU). This method lowers the implementation cost for GPU acceleration of existing Monte Carlo particle transport codes as there is little modification of the particle history logic flow. Three test problems have been evaluated to assess the performance of the volumetric-ray-casting estimator for neutron transport on GPU hardware in comparison to the standard track-length estimator on CPU hardware. Evaluation of neutron transport through air in a criticality accident scenario showed that the volumetric-ray-casting estimator achieved 23 times the performance of the track-length estimator using a single core CPU paired with a GPU and 15 times the performance of the track-length estimator using an eight core CPU paired with a GPU. Simulation of a pressurized water reactor fuel assembly showed that the performance improvement was 6 times within the fuel and 7 times within the control rods using an eight core CPU paired with a single GPU.

AB For many applications the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm had proved to be a very efficient tool for getting the best solution especially when the problem has hundreds of free parameters to optimize. This study aims to expend the list of DE successful scientific applications and to use the DE method for photosynthetic pigments optical response modeling. Chlorophyll (Chl) and bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) are the main pigment molecules of the photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. These complexes are responsible for photon absorption and sequential transport of energy to the photosynthetic reaction center where the charge separation occurs. The DE routines were adopted to perform the fitting of Chl and Bchl Qy band absorption and fluorescence spectra measured in dimethyl ether. To simulate these spectra the stochastic Brownian oscillator model with 49 vibronic modes for Chl and 60 modes for BChl has been applied. By using the artificially calculated spectra, 10 strategies were tested with different settings of the scaling factor (F) and crossover parameter (Cr) before to fit the real experimental data. Once the proper strategy and settings, which give the fastest convergence, were found, the set of parameters representing the electron-phonon coupling (Huang-Rhys factors) and the lowest frequency modes were calculated. These parameters can be used for modeling of the light-harvesting complex nonlinear optical response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a robust and accurate discretization approach for incompressible turbulent flows based on high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods. The DG discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations uses the local Lax-Friedrichs flux for the convective term, the symmetric interior penalty method for the viscous term, and central fluxes for the velocity-pressure coupling terms. Stability of the discretization approach for under-resolved, turbulent flow problems is realized by a purely numerical stabilization approach. Consistent penalty terms that enforce the incompressibility constraint as well as inter-element continuity of the velocity field in a weak sense render the numerical method a robust discretization scheme in the under-resolved regime. The penalty parameters are derived by means of dimensional analysis using penalty factors of order 1. Applying these penalty terms in a postprocessing step leads to an efficient solution algorithm for turbulent flows. The proposed approach is applicable independently of the solution strategy used to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, i.e., it can be used for both projection-type solution methods as well as monolithic solution approaches. Since our approach is based on consistent penalty terms, it is by definition generic and provides optimal rates of convergence when applied to laminar flow problems. Robustness and accuracy are verified for the Orr-Sommerfeld stability problem, the Taylor-Green vortex problem, and turbulent channel flow. Moreover, the accuracy of high-order discretizations as compared to low-order discretizations is investigated for these flow problems. A comparison to state-of-the-art computational approaches for large-eddy simulation indicates that the proposed methods are highly attractive components for turbulent flow solvers.

AB A brief review of the Stefan problem of solidification from a mixture, and its main numerical solution methods is given. Simulation of this problem in 2D or 3D is most practically done on a regular grid, where a sharp solid-liquid interface moves relative to the grid. For this problem, a new simulation method is developed that manifestly conserves mass, and that simulates the motion of the interface to second order in the grid size. When applied to an isothermal simulation of solidification from solution in 1D at 50% supersaturation for only 5 grid points, the motion of the interface is accurate to 5.5%; and for 10 points the result is accurate to 1.5%. The method should be applicable to 2D or 3D with relative ease. This opens the door to large scale simulations with modest computer power. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Flows in which the primary features of interest do not rely on high-frequency acoustic effects, but in which long-wavelength acoustics play a nontrivial role, present a computational challenge. Integrating the entire domain with low-Mach-number methods would remove all acoustic wave propagation, while integrating the entire domain with the fully compressible equations can in some cases be prohibitively expensive due to the CFL time step constraint. For example, simulation of thermoacoustic instabilities might require fine resolution of the fluid/chemistry interaction but not require fine resolution of acoustic effects, yet one does not want to neglect the long-wavelength wave propagation and its interaction with the larger domain.
   The present paper introduces a new multi-level hybrid algorithm to address these types of phenomena. In this new approach, the fully compressible Euler equations are solved on the entire domain, potentially with local refinement, while their low-Mach-number counterparts are solved on subregions of the domain with higher spatial resolution. The finest of the compressible levels communicates inhomogeneous divergence constraints to the coarsest of the low-Mach-number levels, allowing the low-Mach-number levels to retain the long-wavelength acoustics. The performance of the hybrid method is shown for a series of test cases, including results from a simulation of the aeroacoustic propagation generated from a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in low-Mach-number mixing layers. It is demonstrated that compared to a purely compressible approach, the hybrid method allows time-steps two orders of magnitude larger at the finest level, leading to an overall reduction of the computational time by a factor of 8.

AB Assessing impacts of climate change on hydrology involves global scale climate projections by General Circulation Models (GCMs), downscaling of global scale projections to regional scale by statistical methods or regional climate models and then use of regional outputs in hydrological simulations. Hydrological simulations considers varying inputs starting with soil characteristics, land cover, vegetation types, control structures to social parameters such as human interventions, irrigation and water use. This makes the model highly parametrized and at the same time highly uncertain due to the non-availability of majority of input parameters. Here, we compare the contributions of uncertainty from hydrological parameterization in the hydrological projections of climate change to that generated from the use of multiple climate models. The Ganga River Basin in India was selected as the study region. For regional climate change projections, we use dynamic downscaling outputs from Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) and statistical downscaling outputs from a transfer function forced with 3 GCMs, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL), European Consortium Earth System Model (EC-EARTH) and MPI (Max Plank Institut) ESM (Earth System Model). Monte-Carlo Simulations (MCS) are performed with 1000 generated sets of sensitive model parameters for each of the GCM-regional model combination. We find that the observed time series of river discharge is reproduced well but with bias in low-flow conditions. This is probably associated with human intervention and poor representation of baseflow in VIC due to the neglected groundwater storage which feed the surface water during low flow condition. The future projections show that the major uncertainty lies across climate models for all the four seasons (MAM, JJAS, ON and DJF) and for all the hydrological variables, soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), water yield and river discharge. The uncertainty resulting from the MCS is quite small as compared to the climate model uncertainty. We are unable to find any added value in hydrological simulations by rigorous hydrological calibration and parameterization in absence of many required data, when the forcing meteorological data has huge uncertainty. Our findings highlight the need of convergence of climate models before the studies on hydrological impacts assessment and subsequent development of adaptation strategies.

AB Climate change will lead to great impacts on flood frequency curve and design floods in the future. However, traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to analyze the flood characteristics within a bivariate framework under changing environment. Moreover, previous studies investigating bivariate characteristics of flood usually do not derive the adaptive flood quantiles. This study assesses the implications of climate change for future bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume in Ganjiang River basin, China. The outputs of two global climate models (BNU-ESM and BCC-CSM1.1) are statistically downscaled by Daily bias correction (DBC) method and used as inputs of the Xinanjiang hydrological model to simulate streamflow during 1966-2099. Projections for future flood (2020-2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are divided into two 40-year horizons (2040s, 2080s) and a comparison is made between these time horizons and the baseline (1966-2005). Univariate flood frequency analysis indicates that there is a considerable increase in the magnitude and frequency of flood under the RCP8.5 scenario, especially for the higher return periods. The bivariate quantile curves under different levels of Joint Return Period (JRP) for historical and future periods are derived by copula functions and the most likely realizations are estimated. It is found that climate change has heavier impacts on the future joint bivariate quantiles for larger return periods. Finally the adaptive isolines and most likely flood quantiles under a JRP are derived from analyzing the merged series by non-stationary copula-based models. The results highlight that the joint probability, illustrated by the isoline of a given JRP, varies significantly over time when non-stationary models are applied. This study incorporates the impacts of climate change on bivariate flood quantiles and develops an adaptive quantile estimation approach, which may provide useful information for the references of flood risk assessment and management under changing environment.

AB Evaluation of surface soil moisture is necessary to understand spatiotemporal soil moisture trends and their implications on water resources management. This research evaluated a real-time instantiation of NASA's Land Information System (LIS) for water resources management applications at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently available with remotely-sensed satellite estimates or in situ measurements of the same product. Managed by NASA's Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center, the "SPoRT-LIS" is an observation-driven, real-time simulation of the Noah land surface model at a 3-km resolution over the full continental United States. Surface soil moisture estimates from SPoRT-LIS (0-10 cm layer) were validated against in situ soil moisture from the International Soil Moisture Network in the Missouri and Arkansas-Red-White River Basins. Validation was conducted at in situ measurement depths of 5-cm and 10-cm, and performance was evaluated across varying soil types, land cover, depth, slope, aspect, and pixel heterogeneity to determine conditions under which SPoRT-LIS surface soil moisture had excellent estimation capability. Results demonstrate that 53% of data at a depth of 5-cm and 51% of the data at a depth of 10-cm were significantly correlated with a Spearman's p greater than 0.5 on a daily basis. Based upon validation results, it is evident that the SPoRT-LIS surface soil moisture estimate is satisfactory for research and operational water resources management applications.

AB Monthly streamflow records from a set of gauging stations, selected to form a reference hydrologic network, are analyzed together with precipitation and temperature data to establish whether the streamflows in the Guadalquivir River Basin have experienced changes during the last half of the 20th century that can be attributed to hydrological forcing. The observed seasonal and annual streamflows in the reference network have undergone generalized and significant decreases during the study period. Annual rainfall did not experienced statistically significant changes. The observed trends in streamflows may be attributed to either land-use changes, or to the statistically significant changes exhibited both by yearly potential evapotranspiration values and by the seasonal redistribution of precipitation. In the attribution work conducted using both data-based and simulation-based methods, the intra-annual redistribution of precipitation is shown to be the main statistically significant climate-driver of streamflow change. The contributions of other non-climate factors, such as changes in land cover, to the reduction in annual streamflows are shown to be minor in comparison.

AB Future changes in rainfall patterns induced by climate changes will affect society and ecosystems, and quantifying these changes is of utmost importance for the management of hydroclimate risk. In particular, the estimation of intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves for rainfall data is a routine procedure in urban hydrology and hydraulic studies and should be revisited to reflect future changes in rainfall variability. In this work, we propose a novel methodology based on the scaling-invariant property of rainfall duration versus intensity to estimate parameters of a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution at sub-daily scales. A Bayesian inference framework is developed so that uncertainties are reduced and can be easily propagated to IDF curves. The proposed model can be employed to: (i) improve local (at-site) GEV estimates for sites with limited rainfall records; (ii) estimate GEV parameters at sub-daily scales and construct IDF curves for sites where only daily rainfall records are available (partially gauged sites); (iii) construct regional IDF curves for homogeneous hydrologic regions; and (iv) update local and regional IDF curves from simulations of future daily rainfall. The model is tested using historical rainfall data from 18 gauges located in the Han River Watershed in South Korea, and projected climate change scenarios RCP 6 and RCP 8.5 from the Met Office Hadley Centre HadGEM2-AO model. When considering historical data, the results show that the model satisfactorily estimate IDF curves for both gauged and partially gauged sites. In future scenarios, the model reveals a substantial increase in rainfall events of rare intensity (large return periods), mostly due to changes in the rainfall variability rather than changes in the average rainfall. Particularly, for a 100-year return period event, we expect an increase of about 23% in scenario RCP 6 and about 30% under scenario RCP 8.5 when projected using regional IDF curves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first statistical approach in the literature to assess future changes in regional IDF curves, which in our opinion is more suitable than evaluating local estimates only.

AB Drainage and deformation of intercalated confining layers due to internal stress change (discharge/recharge cycle) in an aquifer-aquitard system not only can have great effects on the groundwater storage (GWS), but also can cause unsynchronized water level (WL) fluctuations. The phase relationship between GWS and WL is crucial for the accuracy and attribution of GWS changes. We identify the dominating episodic components of GWS and WL through the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) analysis and Harmonic analysis. First, we analyzed a generic aquifer-aquitard system using numerical simulations which showed that the dissipation of overpressure from the aquitard and flow from it is the inherent cause of a phase shift between the GWS and WL observations. Water released from confining layers with compaction time constant of zero (no-delay) to century time scale results in detected phase shift between total GWS and WL in the aquifer. Then, we analyzed the complex and varied phase relationship between GWS derived using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and measured WL time series in the subsiding North China Plain (NCP) aquifer. The spatially varied phase relationship between GWS and measured WL is reasonably related to varied land subsidence development features and may be related with the compaction time constant and thickness of the confining layers. Results of the generic numerical model and the NCP observations suggest that elastic/inelastic response need to be considered in the interpretation and correction of GWS changes for a compacted aquifer-aquitard system.

TI Gravity effect on consolidation in poroelastic soils under saturated and

AB A rigorous mathematical framework is presented for the development of a set of coupled partial differential equations to describe the consolidation of saturated soils under the simultaneous action of external static loads and gravity forces. These equations generalize the Biot model of poroelasticity in a systematic manner to well account for additional momentum exchange arising from the physical mechanisms involved in gravitational compaction due to changes in volumetric fraction and material density of each constituent.
   A boundary-value problem is then formulated as a representative example to quantitatively examine gravity effect on the dissipation of excess pore fluid pressure and settlement magnitude, and is solved numerically in a finite difference scheme. In the current study, the boundary conditions have been directly calculated in numerical scheme, which improves previous studies to avoid using the approximation of the trapezoidal rule. A physically-consistent parameter, derived fundamentally from the first principle, balance of momentum, is proposed for the first time, which provides an exact measure of the degree to which variations in final total settlement occur due to the presence of gravity effect. This dimensionless parameter takes a closed-form expression that refines our foregoing works, and is quite general since it is applicable to both saturated and variably-saturated soils.
   Our studies show that the variations are essentially controlled by soil elasticity modulus and height, as well as a derived gravity factor. This factor underlines the importance of the dependency between consolidation behaviors and distinct physical properties of pore fluids. Lastly, a comparative study is carried out, indicating that gravity forces yield more significant impact on unsaturated soils than saturated soils we examined, leading to more relative increment in the final total settlement.

AB Small reservoirs represent a critical water supply to millions of farmers across semi-arid regions, but their hydrological modelling suffers from data scarcity and highly variable and localised rainfall intensities. Increased availability of satellite imagery provide substantial opportunities but the monitoring of surface water resources is constrained by the small size and rapid flood declines in small reservoirs. To overcome remote sensing and hydrological modelling difficulties, the benefits of combining field data, numerical modelling and satellite observations to monitor small reservoirs were investigated. Building on substantial field data, coupled daily rainfall-runoff and water balance models were developed for 7 small reservoirs (1-10 ha) in semi arid Tunisia over 1999-2014. Surface water observations from MNDWI classifications on 546 Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI sensors were used to update model outputs through an Ensemble (n = 100) Kalman Filter over the 15 year period. The Ensemble Kalman Filter, providing near-real time corrections, reduced runoff errors by modulating incorrectly modelled rainfall events, while compensating for Landsat's limited temporal resolution and correcting classification outliers. Validated against long term hydrometric field data, daily volume root mean square errors (RMSE) decreased by 54% to 31200 m(3) across 7 lakes compared to the initial model forecast. The method reproduced the amplitude and timing of major floods and their decline phases, providing a valuable approach to improve hydrological monitoring (NSE increase from 0.64 up to 0.94) of flood dynamics in small water bodies. In the smallest and data-scarce lakes, higher temporal and spatial resolution time series are essential to improve monitoring accuracy.

AB Knowledge on the water uptake depths of vegetation is crucial for understanding water transport processes of the soil-vegetation atmosphere continuum and relevant for many applications (e.g. the estimation of groundwater recharge, irrigation planning and the parameterization of (eco-) hydrological models). The identification and quantification of water uptake from deep soil layers and groundwater remain challenging. This study uses a combined framework based on natural abundances of stable water isotopes and isotopic labeling experiments with deuterium oxide ((H2O)-H-2) to study root water uptake and identify uptake from deep soil in a semi-arid environment.
   Between 2013 and 2016, more than 1000 soil (isotope depth profiles); plant (xylem and transpiration) and water (precipitation and groundwater) samples for the analysis of isotope ratios were collected. Two experiments using isotopic labeling were carried out in order to assess root water uptake depths. Herein, we i) present series of deep soil water isotope depth profiles, interpret water transport dynamics and ecohydrological feedbacks; di) examine the suitability of natural isotope depth profiles for identifying deep root water uptake; iii) apply the Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR to quantify deep root water uptake and iv) constrain water uptake depths using isotopic labeling experiments and derive an active root water uptake distribution.
   Our results show that the form of isotope depth profiles of soil in water-limited environments follows characteristic shapes for the end of the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Isotope ratios in the upper 4 m of the soil are heavily dependent on the character of the respective rainy season. Under certain conditions - e.g. droughts or weak rainy seasons - the isotope depth profile displays an enrichment in heavy isotopes up to 4 m depth. Such pronounced anomalies provide an opportunity for studies on source water partitioning. In the present experiment, the studied individuals of Acacia erioloba were found to obtain 37% [24-52%] of their water from deep soil (> 4 m) and groundwater at the end of the dry season of 2015. All other investigated trees (individuals of B. plurijuga, S. luebertii, T. sericea and C. collinum) mainly utilize water originating from 1 m to 2.5 m depth. Under "average" rainy season conditions, the similarity of isotope ratios of potential plant water sources hinders a conclusive identification of water uptake depths.
   Deep natural isotope depth profiles in dry environments can - under certain conditions - be used to identify and quantify access of vegetation to deep water resources. Isotopic labeling enables to determine active root distributions for the lateral root zone. Combined frameworks contribute to a better understanding of deep water uptake. A differentiated consideration of water uptake from the lateral root zone and deep, potentially groundwater-tapping roots is required in order to fully investigate ecohydrological feedbacks and for a proper parameterization of models.

AB In order to obtain an improved soil moisture (SM) dataset at large scale, an advanced SM merging methodology based on error correction methods was constructed to merge the model-based and in-situ observed SM data. The SM datasets in a 0-40 cm soil layer were derived from 10 km x 10 km Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and 797 in-situ stations, respectively. The merging methodology was conducted grid by grid, and mainly included two parts: bias correction and random error correction. Firstly, the bias correction was performed for the VIC simulations by applying the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching approach combined with the kriging technique. Secondly, the random error of the VIC simulations was corrected using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) technique based on a spatio-temporal correlation function which was proposed and constructed in this study. Through validations against in-situ observations, the merged SM was evaluated, and the merging errors in each step were analyzed and discussed. The results showed that the merged SM product was improved compared to the original SM data, both temporally and spatially. The SM merging methodology is effective and reliable in combining the accurate but sparse in-situ observations and the continuous VIC simulations. In addition, the spatial mismatch impact on the representativeness of in-situ stations was limited, and the merging errors were mainly produced in the CDF estimation process. The random error information in the spatial dimension exhibited a bigger impact on the random error correction comparing to that in the temporal dimension. This study provided strong encouragement for the efficient use of in-situ SM observations and provided valuable methods for combining multi-sources SM datasets.

AB Mountainous headwater catchments are safeguards of quality groundwater and hence require special protection against contamination by anthropogenic sources. However, methods currently handling contamination risk fail to produce reliable results in mountainous watersheds because they overlook the influence of downhill flows and contaminant transport in the validation process. To overcome this difficulty, a new model based on so-called "concentration profiles" is presented that combines the DRASTIC framework for evaluation of intrinsic vulnerability, the categorization of land uses for evaluation of specific vulnerability to nitrate and Processing Modflow graphical user interface for simulation of nitrate transport. This model was tested in a mountainous region of Northern Portugal. The risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate was generally classified as moderate. The risky areas are regions used for agriculture and livestock production. These activities have raised nitrate concentrations of spring water (15-25 mg.l(-1)) downstream the risky areas. The Modflow simulations linked the risky areas (contaminant sources) to actual nitrate plumes (contaminant sinks) and modeled nitrate distributions at specific groundwater travel times. Winter plumes could be simulated for the 1-year stress period, and hence are flushable in a short time span. Spring and summer plumes could only be explained by contaminant transport during 10-20 years. In these cases, even if contaminant sources were immediately neutralized, the washout of nitrate would take decades. These results may hold back the fulfillment of sustainable development goals related to water and sanitation until 2030, and hence deserve reflection by water planners and policy makers. The modeling exercise provided extra evidence that safeguarding the catchment headwater is the keystone of groundwater quality protection in mountainous catchments. Therefore, application of this modified DRASTIC to other mountainous areas may not need to resort to Processing Modflow. The study comprises the main paper (this paper) and a MethodsX companion paper.

AB Socioeconomic drought in association with minimum instream flow against the backdrop of local water supply was investigated. An integrated procedure for design combinations of drought properties, such as duration, severity, and peak, involving the truncation of drought events, the goodness-of-fit of joint and marginal distributions of drought properties, the determination of design combinations of these properties for a given Kendall return period, and the evaluation of uncertainty of the combinations, was developed. In multivariate design of socioeconomic droughts in a case study, univariate, bivariate and trivariate design values of drought properties and their alterations due to the regulation of water reservoirs were computed. Results showed that any two properties of drought exhibited a high positive dependence. For a given bivariate return period, the pairs of cumulative frequencies of drought properties formed a symmetric curve for truncated samples and a symmetric curving-belt for large quantities of simulated samples. For a given trivariate return period, the pairs of cumulative frequencies of duration and peak showed a symmetry, but the pairs of duration and severity or severity and peak were remarkably scattered on the side of severity and comparatively concentrated on the side of duration or peak. For the confidence interval of probability of 0.95, the range of trivariate design values was larger than that of bivariate design. The differences between drought design values of univariate, bivariate, and trivariate designs were small, which resulted from high correlations of drought properties, the use of Kendall frequency, and approximate identical cumulative frequencies in design combinations. The decrease of socioeconomic drought properties under the regulation of water reservoirs was significant, but the drought spell, total volume, and monthly maximum of water deficit for a 5-year return period still accounted for 3.06-3.27 months, 0.426-0.470 billion m(3), and 0.211-0.217 billion m(3), respectively, provided that the local water supply was met.

AB Elevated concentration and high variance of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface waters are a challenge for the production of drinking water. Past studies have indicated a dominant role of wetlands in DOC mobilization, but have mainly been focused on boreal and oceanic catchments. Here we analyze the observational DOC time series from 89 temperate humid catchments which drain into German drinking water reservoirs. We characterize the DOC concentration median and variability and utilize partial least squares regression in order to quantify the relation to catchment characteristics such as land use, climate, and topography. We found that the long-term median DOC concentration in the catchment is well predicted by the 90th percentile of the distribution of the topographic wetness index (0.9P TWI) over the entire catchment area. The 0.9P TWI can be directly connected to the abundance of riparian wetlands in the catchments. DOC concentration variability (represented as the ratio of the interquartile range and the median concentrations) was also found to be well predictable. Concentration variability was highest in cold and wet catchments with a high 0.9P TWI. Here we also found stronger correlations between DOC concentrations and discharge, with positive concentration-discharge patterns. Catchments with elevated DOC-concentration variance also exhibited the most severe long-term increases in concentrations. Our results thus indicate that, in temperate climates, riparian wetlands can be the dominant source zones of DOC and control the hydrological mobilization and potentially also the spatial difference in long-term concentration trends observed in surface waters. We conclude that the dominance of topography and climatic conditions in controlling spatio-temporal patterns in DOC concentrations leads to very limited management options.

AB Characterizing the hydraulic conductivity distribution in aquifers is fundamental for groundwater models, solute transport and hyporheic exchange. Based on a total of 13,397 borehole packer test data collected at 12 high dam sites in Southwest China, the statistical distribution of hydraulic conductivity of rocks in this deep-incised valley area was investigated using hypothesis test, regression analysis and semi-variogram analysis, showing that the hydraulic conductivity of igneous and metamorphic rocks at various depths in the study area follows a log-normal distribution within 600 m depth. The vertical variation in hydraulic conductivity K [m/s] and standard deviation of lgK with depth d [m] can be best described by the power function K = 2 x 10(-6) d(-0.48) and the logistic function sigma(lgk) = 0.6/[1 + (d/428)(4.7)]. It is deduced that the decreasing degree of weathering and unloading from ground surface to unaltered fresh rocks leads to reduction in the geometric mean of hydraulic conductivity by about 1-2 orders of magnitude. The hydraulic conductivity of rocks in the study area is more controlled by geologic structures of various origins and scales and less by lithology. The compiled data and analysis presented in this study provide a reference for calibration of catchment hydrological models as well as parameterization of surface water-groundwater interactions in mountainous regions.

AB The predictability of droughts in China was investigated using a series of statistical, dynamic and hybrid models. The results indicate that, statistical models exhibit better skill in forecasting the Standardized Precipitation Index in six months (SPI6) than dynamic models. Overall, the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) method and wavelet machine learning models outperform other statistical models in forecasting SPI6. The hybrid model can improve the performance of SPI6 forecast by combining statistical and dynamic models using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. As for drought onset detection, the 'low probability of detection (POD) low probability of false alarm (POF)' and 'high POD high POF' phenomena exist in statistical and dynamic models, respectively. On average, less than 20% drought onsets can be detected in statistical models while less than 40% in dynamic models, with more than 40% false alarms appearing in statistical models and more than 75% in dynamic models. The hybrid model can slightly balance them, resulting in a POD of 20% and a POF of 50%. In spite of the low predictability, some stations with high equitable threat score (ETS) can be used in early drought warning under certain requirement. These conclusions may help improving drought prediction at a local or national scale.

AB Numerical models of soil-water dynamics have been widely used in the design of soil cover systems for mine site reclamation; however, in most cases these models only consider water dynamics without consideration of heat dynamics. For cover systems in northern climates, such as those associated with oil sands mines in northern Alberta, Canada, freezing conditions exist for approximately 6 months of the year and snow melt comprises approximately 25% of annual precipitation. This study attempts to assess whether a fully coupled water and heat flow model (CM) provides additional insights into cover performance as compared with a water flow model (FM). The CM and FM are developed for a monitored reclamation cover constructed over oil sands shale overburden. The validated results indicated that the key limitation of the CM was its inability to simulate frozen ground infiltration. This limitation results in an overestimate of snow melt runoff and does not replicate the development of perched conditions on the shale overburden surface as a result of snow melt infiltration. The FM is also unable to simulate the observed infiltration of snow melt deep into the cover when snow melt is re-presented simply as surface precipitation in early spring following ground thaw. Both models are improved if snow melt infiltration is represented in the model by the preferential filling of macropores across the full depth of the cover and oxidized shale prior to ground thaw. This methodology is incorporated with the CM to produce a coupled water and heat model with enhanced infiltration (CM-EI), and with the FM to produce a flow model with enhanced infiltration (FM-El). The CM-EI provided an improved simulation of soil temperature dynamics under frozen and unfrozen conditions, as well as soil water dynamics under unfrozen conditions, including the improved representation of the annual water balance components over each water year. Given the small difference in annual water balance components between the CM-EI and FM-EI modelling approaches (similar to 5 mm/year), it is concluded that a FM-EI provides the best tool with which to assess the performance of these reclamation covers.

AB Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is an important parameter for climatological and hydrological studies, as well as for agricultural water resources management. In this study, 7 temperature-based solar radiation models were adopted to improve the Makkink model for ET0 estimation in Northwest China. The temperature-based models only require air temperature as input data, which can be easily monitored in most areas around the world. The applicability of the improved Makkink models (M1-M7), the original Makkink (MK) model, the Jensen-Haise (JH) model as well as the Irmak (IK) model were evaluated on different time scales using meteorological data obtained from 12 weather stations in Northwest China. The results showed that the 7 improved Makkink (MK1) models (R-2 ranged 0.71-0.86) were more accurate than the 3 physical models (R-2 ranged 0.64-0.76) for daily ET0 estimation at the 4 sub-zones of Northwest China, and the M4, M5, M6 and M7 models were superior to the other models. The M5 model had the best estimation accuracy for daily ET0 on daily scale, followed by M7 and M6, with the R-2 median of 0.83, 0.83 and 0.82, the RMSE median of 0.86, 0.88 and 0.89 mm/d, and the GPI median of 1.03, 0.90 and 0.87, respectively. On monthly scale, the 7 MKi models (with relative error almost less than 20%) were also better than the 3 physical models (with relative error usually more than 20%) at the 4 sub-zones. The M5 model also showed the best performance for monthly average daily ET0 estimation, followed by M7 and M6, with the R 2 median of 1.00, 1.00 and 1.00, the RMSE median of 0.13, 0.16 and 0.19 mm/d, and the GPI median of 0.25, 0.05 and 0.02, respectively. Overall, the estimation accuracy of the Makkink model was much improved by using the temperature-based solar radiation models, and in Northwest China, M5 model which only requires temperature and relative humidity as input data is highly recommended to estimate ET0 on both daily and monthly scales.

AB Climate variability along with increase in the demand for water resources highlights the need for better understanding of the link between regional climate and terrestrial water storage. This paper examined the variation of terrestrial water storage in relation to climatic influences over the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) River Basin from GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA), satellite altimetry, rainfall, and Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) anomaly data. Although there is no statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) long-term trend in terrestrial water variation and rainfall in the basin (lake storage, TWSA, and rainfall, p-value = 0.45, 0.48, and 0.55, respectively), in the last decade, two visible droughts occurred between 2002 and 2004, and 2009 and 2010, which resulted in water deficit in the basin, where below average rainfall, TWSA, and lake height (storage) were observed during these periods. Extreme rainfall analysis from Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and strong connection between wet season rainfall, lake height, and TWSA, respectively, indicate interannual terrestrial water storage dynamics in the UBN Basin is strongly influenced by climate. Further, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences rainfall in the UBN Basin, specifically the peak rainfall season (June-September), which shows negative correlation (r = -0.62) with MEI anomaly values, which indicates that the El Nino case (positive MEI values) is linked to the dry conditions in the basin. The findings of this study, combined with studies such as socioeconomic impact of drought, will facilitate better planning and management of water resources in water stressed regions. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the application of a combination of satellite and other hydrologic data in understanding the hydro-climatic condition of a remote basin.

AB Low impact development (LID) practices are effective in restoring natural hydrological processes, but they may be affected by groundwater and pose additional risk to groundwater dynamics and contamination in shallow groundwater conditions. Their performance in shallow groundwater is not well understood due to monitoring difficulty and the deficiency of modeling tools. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is an urban hydrology-hydraulic model that has been widely used to evaluate the performance of LID practices. However, it cannot accurately simulate the hydrological processes of LID practices in shallow groundwater. This study presents the development, calibration, validation, and testing of a modified SWMM (SWMM-LID-GW) that incorporates groundwater feedbacks into LID simulations. The hydrological performance of LID practices under different environmental conditions was simulated, based on which the impacts of initial groundwater table depth, rainfall type, and in-situ soil type were evaluated, and a number of general nonlinear multivariate formulas were proposed to predict the hydrologic performance of LID practices in shallow groundwater environment and support the feasibility analysis of LID practices before project implementation. The reduction of exfiltration and increase of groundwater drainage in shallow groundwater accounted for a significant proportion of the water budget of LID practices. The influence of shallow groundwater was greater for shallower groundwater tables, in less permeable in-situ soils, and for events of higher intensities and longer durations. However, due to the dominant role of shallow groundwater, the impacts of both rainfall type and in-situ soil type on the hydrological performance of LID practices in shallow groundwater were minimal in general, in contrast to the impacts on deep groundwater tables. The SWMM-LID-GW outperformed the current SWMM for a wide range of groundwater conditions, particularly for locations in which the groundwater table frequently rises to 1.0 m or less below ground.

AB It is widely recognized that the prediction of transport of contaminants in a fractured rock mass requires models that preserve several distinctive features of the inner fracture network, like heterogeneity and directionality; in this respect, Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) play a significant role. The solution of the associated equations would claim a high computational demand, that could be met only by using agile and robust numerical techniques. In this note a new numerical technique, fully validated from a mathematical standpoint, is applied to engineering problems, also introducing dispersion models for the description of non-stationary transport phenomena. The method results in a fast and scalable resolution tool, based on a PDE-constrained optimization approach designed to avoid mesh generation problems and allowing for transport simulations with an Eulerian approach. Examples are reported to show the quality of the solution obtained, even by using relatively coarse meshes and quite geometrically complex DFNs.

AB This paper investigates the issues related to the use of validation in hydrological model calibration. Traditionally, models are calibrated and then assessed on an independent period (split-sample) to determine their adequacy in simulating streamflow as compared to observations. In this study, two hydrological models and three North American catchments are used to evaluate the effects of using validation to assess the model parameters' robustness on the model's actual simulation capabilities and accuracy in simulating streamflow. The length of the calibration period is increased from 1 to 16 years, and for each case a large number of randomly selected combinations of years are used for calibration and for validation using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency metric. The calibrated model is then run on an independent 8-year test-period to assess the model's actual performance in simulation mode in unknown conditions. The process is bootstrapped 30 times to ensure the robustness of the results. The tests pit the calibration/validation methods on increasing calibration period lengths against a full calibration on the entire available dataset. Results show that the calibration on the full dataset is the optimal strategy as it generates the most robust parameter sets, provides the best model accuracy on an independent testing period and does not require assumption-making on the modeler's part. The calibrated parameter sets for each test-case were evaluated using the relative bias and correlation metrics, which revealed that the method transfers well to these two other metrics. Results also demonstrate the pitfalls of the commonly used split-sampling strategy, where good parameter sets may be discarded due to model performance discrepancies between calibration and validation periods. The conclusions point to the need to use as many years as possible in the calibration step and to entirely disregard the validation aspect under certain conditions.

AB The coastal Chaouia, located on the Moroccan Atlantic coast, comports three aquifers: a first Plio-quaternary constitutes the cover, a second Cretaceous located at SW in the zone of Azemmour-Tnine Chtouka, and a third Primary located at SE in the zone of Tnine Chtouka-Casablanca. These reservoirs constitute the only exploitable water resource for the social and economic development of the region between Azemmour and Casablanca. These aquifers are unconfined, pellicular, and discontinuous. They feed by infiltration of rainwater and discharge at sea. Agricultural irrigation is carried out exclusively from the groundwater, which causes a drop of the piezometric surface and the intrusion of saltwater into the aquifer at the coast. The consequence is the abandonment of some wells contaminated by seawater leading to conflict situations and significant economic losses. Therefore, delineation of the freshwater/saltwater interface is very important in order to build a sustainable groundwater management system and to implement appropriate regulatory policies.
   The purpose of this study is to determine the extent and the geometric characteristics of the saltwater contamination extent in the coastal aquifers of the coastal Chaouia. To achieve this, 399 vertical electric soundings and 48 electrical resistivity tomography profiles were performed perpendicular to the ocean. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity and the piezometry were measured in 344 wells distributed over the study area.
   The study demonstrated the effectiveness of electrical methods for mapping seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. In fact, the results of the interpretation of the VES and ERTs after calibration with the lithological data of the boreholes, as well as the values of the electrical conductivity, have shown that the length of the saltwater wedge penetration inland depends on the lithological nature of the aquifer formations. Thus, in the zone of Azemmour - Tnine Chtouka, characterized by the presence of Cretaceous terrains, the extension of the saltwater wedge exceeds 2 km towards the continent and its depth reaches 45 m. On the other hand, in the zone of Tnine Chtouka- Casablanca, characterized by the rise of the schists surmounted by the altered schists the seawater intrusion remains limited at 700 m from the coast and at 20 m of depth.

AB Hydraulic redistribution (HR) in sites with shallow soils and its response to random droughts during the summer rainy season in humid areas remains poorly understood. We investigated the soil moisture dynamics, HR and water buffer of shallow soils by monitoring the soil moisture content at multiple depths during a random drought event in the summer rainy season, in typical forestland and orchard in a subtropical area. Soil moisture sensors were installed at depths of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 cm at three sites (forest, peach1, and peach2). The total and net daily water use and water buffer capacity of the root zone were defined and calculated. During the short-term drought, the HR of soil moisture occurred at all sites, suggesting that it could be an important process in both forest and orchard land in response to short-term drought. HR occurred at both daily and multiple-day timescales in the shallow soils. The net daily water use had less difference between the sites than the total daily water use. Principal component analysis of the total and net daily water use showed only evident clustering characteristics for the total daily water use, indicating an important plant-soil interaction effect. The depth-averaged magnitude of daily HR varied from 0.385 mm (0.0077 m(3) m(-3)) at the forest site to 0.725 mm (0.0145 m(3) m(-3)) at the peachl site. The redistributed water replenished over 75% of the water depleted from the shallow soil. In particular, soil moisture was better retained in 15-20 cm root zone than in other soil layers. Furthermore, the water buffer capacity of the forest site was not higher than those of the two peach sites (where land use converted from forest), indicating that land use conversion does not necessarily weaken soil water retention. The study results highlighted that HR has a significant influence on water recharge and water retention in humid area, thus benefiting plant drought tolerance and total water utilization. This study provides more insights to evaluate HR's effect on water retention and enhance our understanding of HR in shallow soils during random droughts in the summer rainy season in humid areas.

AB Sediment and nutrient fluxes from agricultural areas to rivers have led to high dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations that promote algal blooms. Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of sediments on aquatic nitrogen, especially DON, on such blooms. Here, concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, DON, urea, free amino acids (DFAA), combined amino acids (DCAA), excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) were simultaneously determined in both sediments and the overlying waters from three different waterways and their interactions were analyzed, together with sediment enzyme activities, in the agriculture dominant St. Lucie Watershed. Concentrations of DCAA were generally higher, as compared to DFAA regardless of medium. The sum of urea and amino acids accounted for similar to 20% of water DON. The composition of DCAA and DFAA varied between water and sediment. Degradation index of both DFAA and DCAA was similar between sediment and water, suggesting strong exchange activities between water and sediment. Sediment NH4-N concentration was associated closely with 14 water DFAA. A model, comprised of sediment DON, NH4-N, activities of acid phosphatase (AP) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and two fluorescence compounds, can predict the variations of water NH4 center dot N (55%), NO3-N (77%), DOC (83%), DON (64%), DFAA (> 88%), DCAA (62-96%), and fluorescence indexes (98%). While this model provided an accurate prediction of water nutrient status in the St. Lucie Watershed, it still needs to be verified in situ across larger environmental gradients to incorporate real-world complexity and increase generality.

AB Global satellite-gauge merged precipitation (SGMP) products combine the advantages of satellite precipitation estimates with rain gauge data, providing great potential to hydrological applications. However, the inaccuracies of the precipitation products together with hydrologic model limitations, could cause great uncertainty in streamflow predictions. Therefore, this study investigates the hydrological value of three mainstream global SGMP products, including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42V7 product, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHing technique (CMORPH) satellite-gauge merged product (CMORPH BLD), the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) Gauge-calibrated product (GSMaP Gauge). They are used as the precipitation input of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model over the Huaihe River basin in China. To better quantify their effects on parameter calibration and streamflow predictions, a newly developed residual error model accompanied with the Bayesian uncertainty analysis are performed. CMORPH satellite-gauge merged precipitation product, recently developed by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) (CMORPH CMA), is a high-quality regional precipitation product. Thus, this study applies the CMORPH CMA within the same framework to provide a benchmark. The results show that the parameter uncertainty are influenced significantly by the input of various precipitation products. There is a tradeoff between the deterministic streamflow performance and the probabilistic predictive performance for selecting the best input among the three global precipitation products. The streamflow uncertainty intervals of the three global precipitation products are then merged using the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method. The BMA results show satisfying hydrological performance in terms of deterministic streamflow predictions, with the largest Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of Efficiency (NSCE) values of 0.86 and 0.64, and the smallest absolute relative error (RE) values of 0% and 10.2% in the calibration and validation periods, respectively. In addition, the BMA results also produce much more reliable probabilistic predictions, which even outperform the outcomes of the high-quality CMORPH CMA. Our study demonstrates the potential uncertainty of various SGMP products for model calibration and streamflow predictions.

AB Water flow along or across the interfaces of contrasting materials is ubiquitous in hydrology and how to solve them in macroscopic models derived from volumetric average of the pore-scale processes remains elusive. While the change in the average velocity and pressure at water-sediment interface has been well established for channel flow over porous beds, whether a volumetric average alerts the pressure continuity when water flows across the interface of two porous materials is poorly understood despite its imperative implications in hydrological modelling. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide evidences via pore-scale simulations that volumetrically averaging the pore-scale processes indeed yields a discontinuous pressure when water flows across a material interface. We simulated two columns numerically reconstructed by filling them with stratified media: One is an idealised two-layer system and the other one is a 3D column filled by fine glass beads over coarse glass beads with their pore geometry acquired using x-ray computed tomography. The pore-scale simulation is to mimic the column experiment by driving fluid to flow through the void space under an externally imposed pressure gradient. Once fluid flow reaches steady state, its velocity and pressure in all voxels are sampled and they are then spatially averaged over each section perpendicular to the average flow direction. The results show that the average pressure drops abruptly at the material interface no matter which direction the fluid flows. Compared with the effective permeability estimated from the homogenization methods well established in the literature, the emerged discontinuous pressure at the interface reduces the combined ability of the two strata to conduct water. It is also found that under certain circumstances fluid flow is direction-dependant, moving faster when flowing in the fine-coarse direction than in the coarse-to-fine direction under the same pressure gradient. Although significant efforts are needed to incorporate these findings into practical models, we do elicit the emergence of discontinuous pressure at material interface due to volumetric average as well as its consequent implications in modelling of flow in heterogeneous and stratified media.

AB The 1962 Rubi flood was a severe flash flood, the worst to ever take place in Spain, claiming the lives of more than 800 people following 200 mm of rainfall in 2 h. Such a high number of casualties can be explained by the very high vulnerability of people who lived in the floodplains of a wandering, ephemeral stream (a wadi) prone to flash floods. Many publications to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the flood have been used as proxy data for the event, especially in terms of social aspects. The meteorological and pluviometric information is reviewed, while other information is only found in grey literature. Recently, the event has been considered an outlier in the panorama of European flash floods. Because of the above, this paper aims to convey all the information to readers and show that it deserves to be raised to an international level as an example of an extreme flash flood. After addressing some misunderstandings, it can be concluded that the event was not an outlier, nor was it extreme, in terms of total rainfall, return period, discharge, discharge per unit basin area, unit stream power and flow velocity. It may be extraordinary because the flood reached very high levels by transporting large amounts of both fine and coarse sediment particles. The stream is steep, ephemeral, lacking an armour layer, and prone to torrential events, in which the large sediment transport played a role in how high the flood levels rose. The use of flooding marks to compute discharges is also discussed. In addition, the paper presents a torrential calculation based on the momentum principle in a control volume.

AB After the impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, algal blooms frequently occurred in the tributaries of the reservoir, which has posed a great challenge for the local aquatic environment and ecology. To investigate the main causes and key factors of the algal blooms, the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model is applied to the simulation of the three-dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality in the Yangtze River and Xiangxi Bay, and the concept of water age is adopted to quantitatively analyze the effects of hydrodynamics on the water quality by linking water age and phytoplankton levels, which has seldom been explored in previous studies. The model results show good agreement with the field data, and the simulation reproduces the thermal stratification and density current in Xiangxi Bay. The results show that Xiangxi Bay exhibits quite complicated hydrodynamic characteristics, and could be divided into different zones according to the transport process. In the upper reach, the water quality is mainly affected by the upstream inflows, while it is mainly affected by the intrusion flow from the mainstream near the river mouth. Water age and water temperature are found to be the key factors influencing the algal blooms in Xiangxi Bay. Besides, a significant positive correlation has been found between the chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentration in the surface layer and the water age of the dominant water source. This conclusion can be adopted to interpret the longitudinal distribution of chl-a concentration and to explain why Xiangxi Bay is susceptible to algal blooms. The correlation between water age and chl-a concentration is further used to evaluate the effectiveness of water level fluctuation in preventing algal blooms. The analyses and findings in this study could help to better understand the complicated hydrodynamic and water quality processes in Xiangxi Bay following the impoundment, and provide insights into ecological and environmental management of Three Gorges Reservoir.

AB Hysteresis is a widely reported phenomenon in natural and engineered systems across different temporal and spatial scales. Its definition is non-unique and rather context-dependent, while systems with hysteretic behavior, including hydrological systems, are commonly referred to as path-dependent systems or systems with memory. Despite widespread existence of hysteretic processes, the current generation of hydrologic models do not directly account for hysteresis. In this paper, we review the fundamentals, theories, and general properties of hysteresis in the broad scientific literature and then focus on its representations in hydrological sciences. Through illustrative examples, we show how an incomplete understanding or representation of the underlying processes in a system can lead to considering the system as being path-dependent. We argue that, in most cases, hysteresis is a manifestation of our dimensionality-reducing approach to process understanding and representation. We further explain that modelling hysteresis in an ideal world requires a full-dimensional process representation, based on a perfect understanding of the processes, their heterogeneity, and their spatio-temporal scale dependency. We discuss, however, that the missing dimensions/physics in a hydrologic model may be compensated to some extent by enabling the model with formal hysteretic components. Moreover, we show that the conventional model structure and parameterization may be designed in a way to partially reproduce a desired hysteretic behavior.

AB We propose a novel analytical approach that provides a simple, integrated tool for assessing the effects of hydroclimatically-driven flow regime variations on fish habitat. Average habitat quality metrics can be predicted effectively by an analytical equation. This is the result of the integration of two functions describing (a) the flow regime (the frequency distribution of discharge) and (b) the relationship between discharge and habitat quality. We applied this approach as a "proof of concept" to a simple model of velocity thresholds for juvenile salmon fry. The flow regime was described by a gamma distribution with physically meaningful parameters derived using a mechanistic-stochastic approach that explicitly links the flow regime to hydro-meteorological conditions and catchment wetness. Under different flow conditions, habitat quality was estimated using hydraulic habitat models. An empirical analytical function was then used to describe the relationship between specific discharge and habitat quality. Six river channel reaches characterized by different bed geometry and morphology were investigated. Four reaches are located in the Girnock burn, a natural upland river in the North of Scotland, while the remaining two reaches are located in the River Lyon in the central Highlands of Scotland that is heavily regulated for hydropower production. Results show that the stochastic model and the analytical function applied, each containing three parameters, successfully described Girnock (in both dry and wet years) and Lyon (naturalised) flow regimes and captured the relationship between available habitat and specific discharge reasonably well. For each site we obtained heat maps linking climatic and landscape features to bi-monthly average available habitat. These maps can provide clear generalised insights into the potential effects of hydroclimatic variations on metrics of fish habitat and have potential for wider applications using more complex habitat model.

AB In recent years, West Africa has witnessed an increasing number of damaging floods that raise the question of a possible intensification of the hydrological hazards in the region. In this study, the evolution of extreme floods is analyzed over the period 1950-2015 for seven tributaries in the Sudano-Guinean part of the Senegal River basin and four data sets in the Sahelian part of the Niger River basin. Non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (NS-GEV) distributions including twelve models with time-dependent parameters plus a stationary GEV are applied to annual maxima of daily discharge (AMAX) series. An original methodology is proposed for comparing GEV models and selecting the best for use. The stationary GEV is rejected for all stations, demonstrating the significant non-stationarity of extreme discharge values in West Africa over the past six decades. The model of best fit most commonly selected is a double-linear model for the central tendency parameter (mu), with the dispersion parameter (sigma) modeled as either stationary, linear, or a double-linear. Change points in double-linear models are relatively consistent for the Senegal basin, with stations switching from a decreasing streamflow trend to an increasing streamflow trend in the early 1980s. In the Niger basin the trend in mu is generally positive since the 1970s with an increase in slope after the change point, but the change point location is less consistent. The recent increasing trends in extreme discharges are reflected in an especially marked increase in return level magnitudes since the 1980s in the studied Sahelian rivers. The rate of the increase indicated by the study results raises urgent considerations for stakeholders and engineers who are in charge of river basin management and hydraulic works sizing.

AB The Haihe River Basin has become a watershed that suffers from intensive interference from human activities, as landscape patterns and runoff processes have significantly changed in recent decades. Investigating the effect of landscape patterns on surface runoff is helpful for establishing the synergistic evolution relationship between the landscape and the hydrological cycle, providing a theoretical basis and effective way for the future management of water resources. In this study, a landscape metrics approach is used to describe the spatial patterns of landscapes, measure changes in landscape patterns, and relate spatial patterns to surface runoff processes of water resources at a watershed scale. Given that commonly used landscape metrics not considering undulating terrain characteristics, soil properties and landcover conditions, which have significant effects on the surface runoff, a Runoff Landscape Index (RLI) is developed to evaluate the effect of watershed landscape factors on surface runoff. Factors relating to landcover, soil and topography are analyzed, weighed, and integrated during the indicator development. Then, correlation between landscape indicators (RLI and commonly used indicators) and surface runoff is examined. The results show a significant positive correlation between RLI and surface runoff, and the average correlation coefficient is 0.831, much greater than the correlation coefficients for commonly used landscape indices. With potential applications for remote sensing and GIS technology, RLI could be used to efficiently predict annual runoff in ungauged basins even in future land cover scenarios and possibly provide a new perspective for water resource management at the river basin scale.

AB The associations between the seasonal moisture budget (precipitation minus evaporation) and atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections related with dry and wet conditions in the greater Mediterranean Basin are investigated. The driest and wettest Mediterranean winters are selected according to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and the differences in the moisture budget among them and average conditions (i.e. climatology) are investigated. The analysis focuses on the role of major teleconnection indices for the conditions of the driest/wettest winters. According to the results, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index is the best indicator of variability in the driest/wettest conditions, which are conventionally associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Large-scale climate variability over the Mediterranean Basin is strongly linked with significant changes of the moisture fluxes in the Gulf of Mexico region and partially in the east coast region of the United States (US), especially for wet years in the Western Mediterranean. The displacement of the prevailing atmospheric centres of action located over the subtropical mid-east Atlantic (Azores high) to the Northwest Atlantic determines the wet conditions over the Western and Eastern Mediterranean Basins, respectively. It is speculated that the relative strengths and positions of these large-scale systems control the Eastern and Western patterns of the Mediterranean climate variability.

AB A steady increase in the consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal-care products worldwide is increasing their occurrence in the biosphere. The current study describes the abundance of 42 selected emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), including human and veterinary antibiotics, UV-filters and analgesics in the groundwater of the urban aquifer of Zaragoza (Spain), which is affected by intensive exploitation of shallow geothermal resources. The presence of groundwater heat pump systems in the aquifer studied offered the opportunity to study the occurrence of EOCs in relation to groundwater temperature and other physicochemical effects derived from this technology. Analysis of the data obtained allowed us to identify statistically significant relationships between the presence of EOCs and temperature, as well as other physicochemical and geochemical properties of groundwater. The results obtained suggest that temperature is a minor factor controlling the degradation of the organic compounds analysed compared to the oxygen input from groundwater heat pump systems which is possibly increasing the aerobic redox conditions, thus preventing the degradation of organic pollutants. Intensive use of shallow geothermal resources therefore seems to contribute in the prevalence of such compounds in the aquifer close to geothermal systems.

AB Accurate estimation of pan evaporation (Ep) is required for many applications, e.g., water resources management, irrigation system design and hydrological modeling. However, the estimation of Ep for a target station can be difficult as a result of partial or complete lack of local meteorological data under many conditions. In this study, daily Ep was estimated from local (target-station) and cross-station data in the Poyang Lake Watershed of China using four empirical models and three tree-based machine learning models, including M5 model tree (M5Tree), random forests (RFs) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). Daily meteorological data during 2001-2010 from 16 weather stations were used to train the models, while the data from 2011 to 2015 were used for testing. Two cross-station applications were considered between each of the 16 stations and the other 15 stations. The results showed that the radiation-based Priestley-Taylor model (on average RMSE = 1.13 mm d(-1), NSE = 0.53, R-2 = 0.57, MBE = 0.21 mm d(-1)) gave the most accurate daily Ep estimates among the four empirical models during testing, while the mass transfer-based Trabert model (on average RMSE = 1.38 mm d(-1), NSE = 0.25, R-2 = 0.46, MBE = 0.65 mm d(-1)) performed worst. The GBDT model outperformed the RFs model, M5Tree model and the empirical models under the same input combinations in terms of prediction accuracy (on average RMSE = 0.86 mm d(-1), NSE = 0.68, R-2 = 0.73, MBE = 0.07 mm d(-1)) and model stability (average percentage increase in testing RMSE = 16.3%). The RMSE values generally increased with the increase in the distance of two cross stations. A distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations is highly recommended for cross-station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy (median percentage increase in RMSE <5% for cross-station application #1 and <20% for application #2) in the Poyang Lake Watershed of China and maybe elsewhere with similar climates.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of temperature-based models i.e. temperature-based Penman-Monteith FAO 56 fed with average wind speed (U) value (TPMU) and default U quantity (TPM2), Hargreaves-Samani (HS) and FAO Blaney-Criddle (FBC) against Penman-Monteith FAO 56 (PM) using data recorded in 1993-2015 at 146 sites over Iran. Two statistics i.e. normalized Root Mean Square (nRMSE) and relative Mean Bias Error (rMBE) were calculated to analyze the absolute error and bias magnitude of the temperature-based ET0 estimation, respectively. Except for the December-January-February (DJF), the models gave reliable seasonal estimates (i.e. nRMSE of 30 > %) for the majority of studied areas. At monthly scale, FBC gave poor estimates of ET0 in DJF for more than 60% of semi-arid and sub/humid-humid sites. ET 0 in December and January was not also modeled reliably by TPM2 for 61 and 52% of the semi-arid and sub/humid-humid sites, respectively. Hence, application of FBC and TPM2 appears not to be recommendable in cold areas and months over Iran. Overall, TPMU and HS are better suited at all temporal scales under data limitation over the studied areas. In the case of data availability, calculation of TPM with local average U (instead of default quantity of 2 m s(-1)) is highly likely to improve the estimation accuracy. Seasonal and monthly ET0 were mostly underestimated over the hyper-arid/arid sites during the March-April-May (MAM) and June-July-August (JJA). However, TPM2 and HS overestimated ET degrees for the majority of semi-arid and sub-humid/humid areas. The U anomalies were identified as the primary contributing factor to the error in temperature-based ET0 estimation for most cases. TPM2 , HS and FBC provided more accurate estimates for the U range of 1.5-2.5 m s(-1) . These findings are of significant practical importance for agricultural, hydrological and climatic studies and applications under data sparse condition.

AB Knowledge of the transfer of sediment through river systems is essential for understanding the physical, chemical and biological processes on the Earth's surface. A holistic analysis of long-term records of water discharge, sediment transport, riverbed morphology and estuarine hydrology is here used to quantify spatial and temporal variations in fluvial sediment fluxes along the Changjiang River. We show that the establishment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has directly changed the fluvial sediment-transport process by annually trapping 1.23 x 10(8) t of sediment. The upper Changjiang reach has switched from being the main sediment source before 2003 to a depositional sink of fluvial sediment subsequently. The major lakes, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, have shifted from being local sediment sinks before 2003 to sediment sources thereafter, such that they now provide sediment to the Changjiang River. Since the 2003 closure of the TGD the riverbed of the middle-lower Changjiang has become the major source of sediment being transmitted downstream, now providing almost 50% of the material entering the estuary. Shoals in the estuarine channels and landward sediment transport from the sea have become major sediment sources for the river estuary. We conclude that dams currently in preparation along the upper Changjiang reach and adjacent lakes may cause the cessation of sediment supply to downstream reaches. Rising sea levels and frequent storms may terminate landward sediment transport, increasing estuarine erosion and inducing seaward sediment transport. It can therefore be expected that substantial erosion could occur in the near future in the Changjiang estuary system.

AB Accurate quantification of large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) has an important scientific and practical significance. In this study, three global high-resolution ET products were intercompared and evaluated across China; the evaluated ET products were the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) version 3.2, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) version 2.0 Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) dataset, and the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) dataset. The evaluations were performed at the site scale with eddy covariance (EC) based observations from eight flux stations, and at the basin scale with water balance-based ET estimates from 22 river basins in China. The intercomparison results indicated that the three products consistently presented an increasing trend over a large proportion of China but large differences in the trend of the annual ET and the mean annual ET estimates. The trends of the annual ET estimates derived from the GLEAM, GLDAS, and NTSG products are 0.449, 0.904 and 1.261 mm/yr(2), respectively; the countrywide mean annual ET derived from the three products are 390.2, 443.4 and 419.9 mm/yr, respectively. The site-scale evaluation results indicated that the GLEAM and NTSG products achieved comparable consistencies with the monthly gauge observations and outperformed the GLDAS product; GLEAM was more consistent with the daily gauge observations than GLDAS. At the basin scale, all three products were unable to reasonably reproduce the water balance-based annual ET time series in most basins; the three products systematically overestimated ET in the wet basins compared with the water balance-based ET estimates. The differences in the ET estimates among the ET products may be largely attributed to the discrepancies in the forcing data and model algorithms.

AB Relating stream dynamics to catchment properties is essential to anticipate the influence of changing environmental conditions and to predict flows of ungauged rivers. Although the importance of subsurface processes in catchment hydrology is widely acknowledged, geological characteristics are rarely explicitly included in studies assessing physiographic controls on catchment dynamics. In this investigation of 22 catchments of the Swiss Plateau and Prealpes, we use a simple linear regression approach to analyze the relationship between streamflow indicators and various geological and hydrogeological properties of the bedrock and quaternary deposits, along with meteorological, soil, land use and topographical characteristics. We use long-term discharge percentiles, as well as dimensionless flow duration curves (FDC, standardized by long-term mean discharge) that allow to evaluate the catchment response to climate forcing. While climate conditions dominate the high to medium discharge percentiles (Q5-Q50), the capacity of the catchments to buffer the meteorological forcing can only be attributed to geological characteristics. The sandstone proportion in the catchments explains 54% of the variance of both extremities of the dimensionless FDC (Q5/Qmean and Q95/Qmean) and productive quaternary deposits are responsible of 55% resp. 58% of the variance of the two ratios. Examining the hydrogeological characteristics of both bedrock and quatemary lithologies considerably improves the understanding of catchment dynamics.

AB The relevance of fluvial systems to process nutrients and carbon is widely accepted, but their role as sinks and sources of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is still under discussion especially in non-forested and highly productive streams. In this study, we used a mass balance approach at a reach scale in a Pampean stream to elucidate the major sources of water, nutrients and DOC as well as to determine net in-stream retention efficiencies of nutrients and DOC under different hydrological conditions.
   We measured conductivity, conservative ions (chloride and calcium), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate (NO3), nitrite (NO2), ammonium (NH4) and DOC at the end-point of a reach of Las Flores stream (site A), at two upstream tributaries (B1 and B2), and at each potential hydrological contributors to stream flow (groundwater, overland and subsurface flows, and rainfall). In addition, we monitored one storm event where we collected samples during the rising and the recession limb of the hydrograph.
   Stream flow originated from groundwater (approximate to 50%), upstream tributaries (B1 and B2) at baseflow, whereas overland flow contributed > 20% during high flows. During baseflow, groundwater provided NO3 to stream water, while B2, which received a point input of a dairy industry, was the main source of SRP and NH4. Conversely, SRP and NH 4 were provided by B1, overland flow and subsurface flow during high flows. Overland flow also contributed DOC during high flow periods. Mass balance estimates revealed that the reach acts as a source of DOC, SRP and NO3 (21.4, 37.4 and 53.5% mean net in-stream release, respectively) and a sink of NH 4 (-36.8% mean net in-stream retention). Relevant in-stream processes may be nutrient uptake (as in the case of SRP and NH4) and biotic production (DOC), as well as decomposition (SRP) and nitrification (NH4) in this Pampean stream. Our results stress the relevance of nutrient and DOC generation processes within the channel in non-forested and highly productive streams.

AB Urbanization modifies the hydrologic cycle, resulting in increased runoff rates, volumes, and peak flows in the drainage network. In this paper, the implementation of green roofs as source control solutions for mitigating the impacts of urbanization is analysed at the urban catchment scale. The hydrologic-hydraulic response of a 2 km(2) urban basin is investigated under various implementation scenarios and rainfall characteristics. In particular, a distributed hydrologic model is employed to assess the impact of 4 spatially homogeneous installations of green roofs (25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of roofs area converted) when forced by 6 storms differing in both duration and return period. In addition, a spatially heterogeneous configuration is tested, with green roofs concentrated where the drainage network is more prone to high degrees of filling. Results show that implementing green roofs at the urban watershed scale can be considered a valuable strategy to reduce both flow peak and volume in urban drainage networks, although the approach is more effective for frequent storms of smaller magnitude. In addition, it is found that the urban system may respond non-linearly to the extent of green roofs implementation in terms of peak flow reduction at the network outlet, and that non-linearity is mainly related to the network being close to its flow convey capability. Finally, planning redevelopment efforts on the basis of local insufficiencies in network convey capacity has the potential of increasing the effectiveness of Low Impact Development solutions.

AB The longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems refers to the process-based connections between upstream and downstream areas and is fundamental to understanding the dynamic and nonlinear hydrological behaviour of river basins. However, the quantification of such connectivity remains a challenge due to the absence of a consensus on the appropriate data and methods, especially in delta plains. In this study, based on the difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations, a new and quantitative longitudinal functional connectivity index (LFCI) was developed for delta plains. Focusing on the Taihu Plain, we then analysed the spatial-temporal changes in the LFCI during 1960-2012 and investigated the correlations between the LFCI and climate change and human activities. We found that the decadal, annual and seasonal changes in the average LFCI all presented slightly increasing trends in the recent 50 period, but the annual average LFCI increased significantly after 1978; the average LFCIs in June, July, and August of the flood season were less than those in other months in the Taihu Plain. We also found that the spatial-temporal changes in the average LFCI exhibited larger differences at the subregional and station scales; those in the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu subregion were least, and the average LFCIs at stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were less than those at other stations. Moreover, we found that the average LFCI had significant correlations with precipitation, river density and water surface ratio. Our results were consistent with common sense facts, which demonstrated that the indicator developed in this study can quite effectively quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains.

AB Groundwater resources are shared across management boundaries. Multiple management units that differ in scale, constraints and objectives may manage a shared resource in a decentralized approach. The interactions among water managers, water users, and the water resource components influence the performance of management strategies and the resilience of community-level water supply and groundwater availability. This research develops an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to capture the dynamic interactions among household-level consumers and policy makers to simulate water demands. The ABM is coupled with a groundwater model to evaluate effects on the groundwater table. The framework is applied to explore trade-offs between improvements in water supply sustainability for local resources and water table changes at the basin-level. A group of municipalities are simulated as agents who share access to a groundwater aquifer in Verde River Basin, Arizona. The framework provides a holistic approach to incorporate water user, municipal, and basin level objectives in evaluating water reduction strategies for long-term water resilience.

AB Excessive river erosion and sedimentation threatens critical infrastructure, degrades aquatic habitat, and impairs water quality. Tools for predicting the magnitude of erosion, sedimentation, and channel evolution processes are needed for effective mitigation and management. We present a new numerical model that simulates coupled river bed and bank erosion at the watershed scale. The model uses modified versions of Bagnold's sediment transport equation to simulate bed erosion and aggradation, as well as a simplified Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM) to simulate bank erosion processes. The model is mechanistic and intermediate complexity, accounting for the dominant channel evolution processes while limiting data requirements. We apply the model to a generic test case of channel network response following a disturbance and the results match physical understanding of channel evolution. The model was also tested on two field data sets: below Parker Dam on the lower Colorado River and the North Fork Toutle River (NFTR) which responded dramatically to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. It accurately predicts observed channel incision and bed material coarsening on the Colorado River, as well as observations for the upstream 18 km of the NFTR watershed. The model does not include algorithms for extensive lateral migration and avulsions and therefore did not perform well in the lower NFTR where the channel migrated across a wide valley bottom. REM is parsimonious and useful for simulating network scale channel change in single thread systems responding to disturbance.

The analytical solutions of the fractional derivative models are given and all parameters are determined based on test data. The dependence of fractional derivative models on parameters such as fractional derivative order and threshold hydraulic gradient are analyzed by sensitivity studies. The fractional derivative models provide better description of non-Darcian flow in porous media under the conditions of high and low velocity. Furthermore, the memory effectiveness of fractional calculus is discussed, showing that the fractional derivative order is an indicator of non-Darcian flow in porous media.

AB Chalcogenide amorphous materials, such as GeTe, are known to exhibit deposition dependent optical and structural properties. The formation of a single and homogeneous amorphous GeTe (a-GeTe) phase is questionable since the deposited films can be mixtures of monoelemental nanoclusters. In this work, we employed two deposition techniques, pulsed laser deposition from a polycrystalline GeTe target and co-sputtering from two distinct Ge and Te targets, respectively, to obtain a-GeTe films. To improve the homogeneity of the amorphous phase obtained by magnetron sputtering, the substrate temperature was varied from room temperature up to 180 degrees C. The samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. It was found that the film mass density, optical bandgap, refractive index and absolute reflectivity become progressively larger with increasing substrate temperature, due to the minimization of voids fraction and the number of dangling bonds in the amorphous structure. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results prove the formation of Ge-Te bonds and therefore of the GeTe alloy at the optimal substrate temperature of 180 degrees C. This study reveals the importance of optimizing the deposition conditions for obtaining a specific amorphous phase, which enables the atomic rearrangements responsible for fast phase-change needed in memory applications.

AB A novel Fe-based metallic glass (Fe0.52Co0.30Ni0.18)(73)Cr17Zr10 without metalloids has been prepared. Its mechanical properties and plastic deformation behavior have been investigated systematically by bending test, tensile test and Vickers indentation test. This metallic glass ribbon exhibits good bending ductility, but it shows catastrophic brittle fracture in tensile tests. The Vickers hardness is 904.4 HV, which is higher than most of used quenched steel, manifesting the possibility of good wearability. Under different indentation forces, the plastic deformation of indentation is adjusted through radial and semi-circular shear bands. The average indentation size(D) and the radius of plastic deformation zone(R) increases with increasing indentation forces(P). The normalized shear deformation zone(R/D) is unrelated with indentation forces.

ID SYSTEM
AB The glass-forming domain in the new Sb2O3-PbCl2-LiCl system has been delimited. Systematic investigations were undertaken to establish the influence of each starting component on the characteristic temperatures (T-g and T-x) and the density. Glasses have T-g between approximately 255 degrees C and 310 degrees C for the richest LiCl and the free LiCl compositions, respectively. A decrease of the network connectivity due to the PbCl2 or Lid is supported by the data. AC, DC, and Thermally Simulated Deposition Current (TSDC) measurements were carried out to study the electrical properties of the lithium and lead chloride antimonate glasses. The interpretation of the results was supplemented by X-ray diffraction and TEM measurements in order to identify and quantify the crystalline phases observed in crystallized compositions after quenching. The positive effect of PbCl2 on conductivity was established although the TSDC demonstrates the Li+ ions can be considered as the only charge carriers in this system.

AB A series of flexible and free standing composite membranes based on polyethylene oxide (PEO) and the nematic liquid crystal (LC) E8 were prepared using solution casting technique. The effect of the LC concentration on the structural modifications of PEO/E8 LC composites was investigated by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), micro-Raman and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The electro-chemical impedance measurements were performed in the applied frequency range of 0.1 Hz - 2 MHz. The dielectric properties of the PEO/E8 LC membranes were studied upon variation of the LC concentration and results were analyzed by Kohlrausch - Williams - Watts and Havriliak - Negami formalisms. These investigations pointed out that LC doped polymeric membranes display remarkable features that could be interested for their use as novel composite electrolytes for rechargeable metal ions batteries.

AB Glasses with composition (59.5-x)P2O5-20.0MgO-20.0ZnSO(4)-0.5Dy(2)O(3)-xAgCl (0.0 <= x <= 0.5 mol%) were prepared by melt-quenching method and characterized thoroughly. The role of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) inclusion on the spectroscopic and the physical properties of the synthesized glasses were determined. Judd-Ofelt (J-O) theory was used to complement the experimental optical data. TEM images confirmed the existence of Ag NPs of average size approximate to 4.5 nm. The absorption spectra showed eleven bands aroused from the ground state (I-6(15/2)) to various excited states transitions of dysprosium (Dy3+) ion. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of Ag NPs was probed around 446 nm. The calculated J-O parameter (Omega(2)) for the glass without Ag NPs incorporation was the highest, indicating the strong metal-ligand covalence bond. Irrespective of Ag NPs contents, the emission spectra of the studied glasses revealed two intense photoluminescence bands centered at 480 nm (blue: F-4(9/2)-> H-6(15/2)) and 574 nm (yellow: F-4(9/2)-> H-6(13/2)) accompanied by two very weak red bands positioned at 662 and 752 nm. The luminescence intensity of both blue and yellow band was enhanced by a factor of 2 and it was 1.5 fold for the red bands. This enrichment in the luminescence intensity was attributed to the Ag NPs mediated SPR effect and subsequent energy transfer from the Ag NPs to the nearsighted Dy3+ ions.

AB In previous study, it was found that the fractal dimension of the silica aerogel could be only controlled by adjusting the catalysts. In this work, we used the aging process investigated by H ae reid et al. to continuously adjust the fractal dimension of silica aerogel. The fractal structure of the silica aerogels were analyzed by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). The SAXS measurements show linear increases in the volume fractal dimension (2.32-2.64) of the secondary particles with aging time (0-72 h). This linear behavior is due to the silica precipitated from the aging solution to the secondary particles is at a constant rate. In the meantime, the light transmittances was obtained by ultraviolet-Visible-infrared spectrophotometer, extinction coefficient were obtained by fitting the curve of light transmittances. We developed a new model to build a connection between the extinction coefficient and the fractal dimension of the silica aerogel obtained by SAXS. From new model, it was found it is due to the increases in volume fractal dimension (D-f) that result in increases of extinction coefficient and decreases of light transmittances. The optical transparency of silica aerogel is strongly affected by the volume fractal dimension (D-f) of the secondary particles of silica aerogel.

AB We have used highly accurate first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to explore the structural (both topological and chemical ordering) evolution during solidification of Mg90Ca10 and MgaoAlio liquids upon cooling. Using various structural analysis methods, we find that local atomic structure of both amorphous alloys are characterized by major distorted and perfect icosahedral symmetry. The fraction of fivefold icosahedra around Mg atoms in Mg-Ca alloy is higher than in Mg-Al alloy. Eutectic Mg90Ca50 alloy shows strong chemical short range order, which further increases upon cooling. In contrast, Mg90Al10 shows weak chemical short range ordering which seems to show weak temperature dependency behavior. The fraction of fivefold icosahedral symmetry, which is responsible for geometrical frustration, and the atomic size are responsible for the dynamic slowdown and causing glassy formation.

AB Silica aerogels are considered as promising materials for future energy saving buildings, however, their reliability remains questionable as commercially available aerogels can show relatively high standard deviations e.g. 22.2 +/- 1.4 mW m(-1)K(-1). Therefore a synthesis protocol for silica aerogel powder with thermal conductivities having extremely reduced standard deviations was designed, compatible with mass production, i.e. reduced use of solvents and hydrophobization agents. Silica sols were prepared from non-ion exchanged water glass, while a combined solvent exchange, silylation and washing out of sodium ions was carried out using a hexane/trimethylchlorosilane/isopropyl alcohol solution with a molar ratio trimethylchlorosilane/pore water of only 0.11. The hexane amount was reduced 35 times compared to typical processes in literature. The aerogel powder was finally dried at ambient pressure at 150 degrees C. No notable shrinkage was observed for 8 wt% silica aerogel samples, having a thermal conductivity of 25.4 mW m(-1) K-1 with a standard deviation of only 0.1. The 6 wt% silica aerogels had a thermal conductivity of 23.4 mW m(-1) K-1 with a standard deviation of 0.3, but had shrunken 36%. By replacing trimethylchlorosilane with hexamethyldisiloxane, aerogels having a thermal conductivity of 22.4 mW m(-1) K-1 with a standard deviation of 0.3 were obtained.

AB According to recent studies, Cu-Zr and Ni-Zr binary alloying systems are very similar based on known glass forming ability criteria, however, they exhibit significant difference in glass-forming ability in practice. In this work, local atomic structures of Cu-Zr and Ni-Zr metallic glasses are studied by molecular dynamics simulation to explain the source of mentioned difference. The total and partial distribution functions, coordination number and voronoi analysis are utilized to characterize the local atomic structures around Zr, Ni and Cu atoms. It was found that the local environment around Zr atoms is almost similar in both systems. The difference in the atomic structure in these systems mainly arises from topologies of polyhedra around Cu and Ni atoms. In particular, full icosahedron is one of the most popular local structure in Cu-Zr system, while its population is significantly smaller in Ni-Zr system with the same composition. Additionally, networks formed by full icosahedra connections, medium range order, are more robust in Cu-Zr system. Higher percentage of topologically ordered and compact structures and their connectivity could explain why bulk metallic glass formation is possible in Cu-Zr system but not in Ni-Zr system.

AB In this work, a series of dense arc-sprayed Fe-B-Si-Nb-Cr-Mo glassy coatings were developed. The effects of Cr and Mo on glass formation and mechanical properties were explored in details. The coatings have a full glassy state. Thermal stability of the coatings increases remarkably with addition Cr and Mo. The onset crystallization temperature (T-x) increases from 797 K to 912 K. The hardness increases from 16.4 GPa to 18.7 GPa. The relatively wear resistance of the FeBSiNbCrMo glassy coating is about 7.8 times and 1.5 times that of Q235 steel and the FeBSiNb coating, respectively. The corrosion resistance in 3.5 wt% NaCL solution reveals that the FeBSiNbCrMo glassy coating has the lowest I-corr and the highest fitted R-t An attempt has been established to discuss correlations between structural characteristics and mechanical properties of the coatings with different elements.

AB Intermediate phases represent the so called "sweet spot" in amorphous material systems where the bond stretching and bond bending constraint forces are equally balanced by the total degrees of freedom in the system. They are sometimes also referred to as "Boolchand" phases in recognition of the seminal contributions of Dr. Punit Boolchand to the study of these materials. In a prior publication (King et al., J. Non-Cryst Solids 379 (2013) 67), we presented possible evidence for the existance of an intermediate (i.e. "Boolchand") phase in amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) with a wide range in mean atomic coordination (< r > = 2.4 - 2.7). Support for such a wide phase window was based primarily on a correlation between the post plasma deposition bi-axial film stress and < r >. However, we demonstrate in the present article that the apparent width of the Boolchand intermediate phase window in the prior study was inflated due to two competing film stress contributions, and that the true range in < r > for the phase window is substantially narrower. Specifically, opposing tensile and compressive film stress components were identified to arise during the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of a-SiC:H. The tensile film stress component was attributed to film/substrate thermal contraction mismatch on cooling from the deposition temperature, while the compressive stress component was attributed to ion bombardment of the a-SiC:H growth surface during PECVD. In the prior study, the energy of the ions during PECVD was primarily modulated by the addition of a low frequency bias to the plasma and was intentionally utilized to produce films with varying compressive stress and < r >. In the present study, the low frequency bias was removed from the PECVD of a-SiC:H and instead the deposition pressure was varied to produce films with varying < r > and exclusively tensile stress. Through detailed analysis of the tensile bi-axial film stress and Young's modulus dependence on < r >, we found conclusive evidence that the film-substrate thermal contraction mismatch was the dominant film stress component in this case and that the magnitidue of the tensile stress was purely due to rigidity percolation in the a-SiC:H film. We therefore conclude that in our previous study the balance of the tensile and compressive stress components resulted in the deceptive appearance of a potentially wide Boolchand intermediate phase window for a-SiC:H. Based on the a-SiC:H films generated in the present study where only the tensile stress component was significant, we have found the window for a possible intermediate phase to be greatly narrowed at Delta < r > <= 0.05.

AB The annealing effect below glass transition temperature (T-g) on nanoindentation hardness and shear transformation zone (STZ) volume was studied in a Ni-Nb metallic glassy thin film. The indentation size effect (ISE) and loading rate effect on hardness were systematically investigated. It was found that ISE was less pronounced and strain rate sensitivity (SRS) was higher in the sample suffered longer annealing time. As annealing time reached a critical value, hardness value, ISE and SRS changed quite limited which could be due to full structure relaxation in samples. The hardness spatial distribution was more scattered with increasing annealing time, indicating a more pronounced mechanical heterogeneity at microscale. Based on SRS values and cumulative probability distribution of hardness, STZ volumes were estimated upon two distinct methods, respectively. A tight correlation between STZ volume and structure state was revealed. As increasing annealing time, STZ volume was continuously decreased and approached down to a stable value.

AB Glasses in the ternary xLi(2)O + (33-x)CaO + 67B(2)O(3) tetraborate system, with x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 33 mol%, were prepared by melting and casting. The glass structure, and thermal, and electrical response of highly transparent and homogeneous glasses were evaluated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Impedance Spectroscopy (IS). The glass transition temperature (T-g) decreases as CaO is substituted by Li2O (increasing x), while the thermal stability against crystallization to the supercooled liquid in the region T-g < T < T-l where T-l is the liquidus temperature, increases up to x = 20, according to Delta T  (T-oc-T-g), where T-oc is the onset temperature of the first exotherm crystallization, and also considering the Hubrys (K-H), and Weinberg's (K-W) thermal parameters. The short range order (SRO) structural change in this glass series is governed by the isomerization reaction Bempty set(2)O(-) double left right arrow Bempty set(4)(-), also designated as B-2 double left right arrow B-4, where the superscript defines the number of bridging oxygens (BOs) on the SRO structural units. Li2O substituting CaO in this tetraborate glass compositional series favors the formation of tetrahedral boron, B-4 SRO units, isomerization reaction for compositions up to 10 mol%. For glasses at higher lithium oxide contents, the reaction in the opposite direction is favored towards the formation of the metaborate B-2 SRO units. A dramatic increase in the ionic conductivity at 300 degrees C of more than 10 orders of magnitude was observed across this same compositional series. This dramatic increase is related to the higher mobility of the Li+ ions, which has a smaller ionic radius, 0.59 angstrom (four-fold coordination) and a single ionic charge compared the significantly larger, 1.00 angstrom (six-fold coordination) and divalently charged Ca2+ ions in the glassy structure arrangement.

AB The results of experimental study of silver-containing lanthanum-phosphate glasses, modified by electron irradiation with electrons energy E = 5 and 50 keV and thermal treatment are presented. The concentration of Ag2O in glasses was 17 and 30 mol%. It is shown that initially silver is contained in glasses mainly in a state of subnanosized neutral molecular clusters (MCs). Local electron irradiation results in the increase of MCs concentration in the irradiated zone. This process is accompanied by the appearance of luminescence outside the irradiated zone. Redistribution of silver during electron irradiation is confirmed by X-ray spectral microanalyses. During irradiation with E = 5 keV some part of silver migrates to the glass surface, forming the solid silver film. During thermal treatment the growth of silver MCs takes place, and, at last, they form silver nanoparticles (NPs).

AB A multiobjective optimization procedure is employed to retrieve the viscoelatic parameters of silica aerogel clamped plates. This retrieval method preserves the aerogel sample integrity and, in contrast to the existing ones, relies on the minimization of two different cost functions. The first one, namely J(1), is related to the reflective properties of clamped plates backed by a rigid cavity, while the second one, namely J(2), concerns both the reflectance and transmittance spectra measured in transmission configuration. The recovered parameters are in agreement with previously reported values in the literature. In addition, they are also supported by designing structures for perfect absorption (100% of absorption), which has been validated experimentally. Aerogel plates can be therefore used as innovative building units of artificial structures for the broadband absorption of sound.

AB The temperature dependence of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids can be characterized by the dynamic fragility (m) and apparent activation energy (E-a) at the glass transition temperature T-g. In this study, we derive analytical expressions that allow the calculation of these parameters from a modified Kaelble equation which divides the temperature dependence into two regimes above and below a characteristic temperature T-d. Special emphasis is given to the analysis of the T-d parameter that can be considered as the rheological glass transition temperature. Rheological characterization is performed on twenty-seven bitumens originating from various crude oil sources and refining processes. Their dynamic fragilities and apparent activation energies are calculated at the calorimetric T-g and at T-d. Bitumen can be classified as a strong glass-forming liquid, dynamic fragilities varying in the range of m(T-g) = 26 ... 52 for the individual bitumen samples. The results indicate that m (T-g) and E-a(T-g) are linearly correlated with T-g and these T-g-dependences are unusually strong in comparison to other classes of glass-forming liquids. However, dynamic fragilities and apparent activation energies evaluated at T-d are nearly independent of the type of bitumen and show only a weak dependence on T-d.

AB The indium and aluminum nitride (InxAl1-xN) semiconductor material was postulated in 2008 as an excellent candidate to produce solar cells. In this research, amorphous layers of InxAl1-xN (0.55 <= x <= 0.60) were synthesized using the RF sputtering magnetron technique, and then studied for their possible use in photovoltaic applications. Physical, structural, morphological, optical, and electrical properties were studied. The amorphousness was checked by XRD difractograms. Samples have very smooth surfaces, with very low roughness values, according to AFM and SEM techniques.
   Electrical properties of the InAlN films were studied using Van Der Pauw technique and Hall Effect parameters. The volumetric carrier concentration decreases when InN fraction mole increases. The mobility values range between 6 x 10(-2) and 5 x 10(-1) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), which are lower than those obtained for crystalline and polycrystalline samples. The obtained band gap values could be used in both the absorbing layer and the window layer in solar cells (1.9 eV-2.3 eV). Interestingly, this figures of Eg are very close to the previously obtained values for polycrystalline samples. The optical absorption coefficients were high compared to the materials currently used in solar cells (similar to 10(5) cm(-1)). This implies the possibility of using thinner layers in photovoltaic devices based on InxAl1-xN.

AB It has been shown that the additional annealing of thermally poled silicate glasses at temperatures exceeding the glass poling temperature and close to, but below, the glass transition temperature leads to an essential decrease of the volume of polarized regions and, as the result, to an increase in the height of the surface relief structures formed by poling with profiled relief anodic electrode. Thermodynamic and rheological explanations of the found volume decrease are given.

AB We present a method for high temperature stabilization of bulk amorphous aluminium oxide. The stabilization is achieved by dispersing polysilane dendritic molecules in aluminium hydroxide gel, which upon thermal treatment gives amorphous aluminium oxide stable up to 900 degrees C. The dispersed macromolecules covalently bind to the alumina matrix and induce homogeneously distributed strain fields that keep the alumina amorphous. The thermal conversion of the precursor system was followed by thermogravimetry with an evolved gas analysis, infrared spectroscopy and Si-29 NMR. The amorphous structure of aluminium oxide was confirmed with an X-ray and electron diffraction. Additionally, the amorphous state was supported by presence of penta-coordinated aluminium detected by Al-27 NMR and a low bandgap measured by a UV-visible absorption spectroscopy.

AB The properties of Na2O-B2O3-SiO2+La2O3 glasses (NBS_La) are not well understood. In particular the influence of the lanthanides on the polymerized network structure and organization are not well known. In this work, we use a Polarizable Ion Model (PIM) that was fitted on electronic structure calculations to simulate a series of NBS_La glasses using molecular dynamics. The simulations account well for the main structural characteristics of NBS_La glasses such as the structure factors and the ionic local environments despite minor discrepancies with experiments about the Si-O distance and the B coordination. In particular, we examine the impact of La2O3 addition to Na2O-B2O3-SiO2 glasses in term of structural changes and in the Na migration paths which become more homogeneous.

AB The glass properties as well as the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of Li2O-B2O3 and Li2O-Al2O3-B2O3 glasses are investigated; both glass systems are optically-activated by the addition of the lanthanide ions Tb3+, Eu3+, and Dy3+. Glass transition, glass crystallization, and glass melting temperatures as well as glass forming temperature ranges are determined upon varying the modifier-to-former (Li2O-to-B2O3) ratio in the range between 1:6 to 1:2. For lithium borate glass, the risk of spontaneous crystallization decreases upon decreasing the lithium concentration. The photoluminescence quantum efficiency increases slightly upon decreasing the lithium concentration with the value of a Al2O3-containing sample always lower than that of the Al2O3-free correspondent.

AB The by-product silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) was usually obtained from polysilicon industry and was a cheaper alternative precursor. An economic method to produce silica aerogel using silicon tetrachloride under ambient pressure drying was presented in this work, which can also solve the pollution problem during the by-product silicon tetrachloride treatment process. The prepared aerogel samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, thermal conductivity analysis, contact angle test, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that the molar ratio of H2O/SiCl4 could affect the properties of aerogels seriously. The density and thermal conductivity first decreased and then increased as the molar ratio increased from 13 to 32. The porosity showed an opposite trend with the density. Silica aerogel with high specific surface area (856.7 m(2)/g), low density (0.077 m(3)/g) and low thermal conductivity (0.0213 W/m.k) were obtained at the optimal conditions when the molar ratio was 25. The resulting aerogel is also mesoporous material with super hydrophobicity and have a huge application in thermal insulation field.

AB The presented study shows how the incorporation of silver changes the structure and physical properties of chalcogenide glass (GeS2)(50)(Sb2S3)(50). Nine samples with silver content (0-25 at. %) were studied to give a detailed picture. The structure and its changes were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. The medium range order of the (GeS2)(50)(Sb2S3)(50) glass was identified. The structural motif of interconnected SbS3/2 pyramids is the doorway for the silver incorporation in the (GeS2)(50)(Sb2S3)(50) glass. The material hardness is significantly increased by up to 26% due to silver addition. The ability of silver to fill cavities in a glass is responsible for the observed hardness increase. Electronic properties and silver ion mobility were examined by impedance spectroscopy and radioactive tracer diffusion. The purpose of the presented study is to give an instructive description of how silver change the structure of the studied chalcogenide glass and give a complex feeling of how the silver changes its physical properties.

AB The influence of heat treatments on the crystallization behavior and magnetic properties of Fe85Si1.4B9Cu0.5P4C0.1 amorphous alloy were investigated. The as-spun ribbon was annealed at various temperatures for different time in nitrogen atmosphere. It indicates that both of annealing temperatures and time have an important influence on the formation of nanocrystalline structure. Through a series of heat treatments, it found that the rapid thermal processing could effectively prevent the precipitation of Fe-(B, P) compounds and reduce the Hc of alloy. Before the precipitation of secondary phases, the increase of annealing time is effective for the precipitation of a large number of alpha-Fe phases, which contributes to the increase of saturation magnetization (Ms) of the alloy. The Fe85Si1.4B9Cu0.5P4C0.1 nanocrystalline alloy annealed at 420 degrees C for 1 min exhibits lowest He of 5.5 A/m and higher Ms. of 204.5 emu/g (Bs approximate to 1.92 T). The Fe85Si1.4B9Cu0.5P4C0.1 nanocrystalline alloy annealed at 420 degrees C for 30 min exhibits highest Ms. of 207.9 emu/g (Bs approximate to 1.95 T) and lower He of 6.7 A/m.

AB The transcriptional regulator CpxR mediates an adaptive response to envelope stress, tightly linked to virulence and antibiotics resistance in several Gammaproteobacteria pathogens. In this work, we integrated crystal-lographic and small-angle X-ray scattering data to gain insights into the structure and conformational plasticity of CpxR from Escherichia coli. CpxR dimerizes through two alternative interaction surfaces. Moreover, widely different CpxR conformations coexist in solution, from compact to fully extended ones. The possible functional implications of these structural features are discussed.

AB Human bone is known to adapt to its mechanical environment in a living body. Both its architecture and microstructure may differ between weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing bones. The aim of the current study was to analyze in three dimensions, the morphology of the multi-scale porosities on human cortical bone at different locations. Eight paired femoral diaphyses, femoral necks, and radial diaphyses were imaged using Synchrotron Radiation mu CT with a 0.7 mu m isotropic voxel size. The spatial resolution facilitates the investigation of the multiscale porosities of cortical bone, from the osteonal canals system down to the osteocyte lacunar system. Our results showed significant differences in the microstructural properties, regarding both osteonal canals and osteocytes lacunae, between the different anatomical locations. The radius presents significantly lower osteonal canal volume fraction and smaller osteonal canals than the femoral diaphysis or neck. Osteocytes lacunae observed in the radius are significantly different in shape than in the femur, and lacunar density is higher in the femoral neck. These results show that the radius, a non-weight-bearing bone, is significantly different in terms of its microstructure from a weight-bearing bone such as the femur. This implies that the cortical bone properties evaluated on the femoral diaphysis, the main location studied within the literature, cannot be generalized to other anatomical locations.

AB Particle picking is a crucial first step in the computational pipeline of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Selecting particles from the micrographs is difficult especially for small particles with low contrast. As high-resolution reconstruction typically requires hundreds of thousands of particles, manually picking that many particles is often too time-consuming. While template-based particle picking is currently a popular approach, it may suffer from introducing manual bias into the selection process. In addition, this approach is still somewhat time-consuming. This paper presents the APPLE (Automatic Particle Picking with Low user Effort) picker, a simple and novel approach for fast, accurate, and template-free particle picking. This approach is evaluated on publicly available datasets containing micrographs of beta-galactosidase, T20S proteasome, 70S ribosome and keyhole limpet hemocyanin projections.

AB The pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, is cultured for pearl production in Japan. The shell of the pearl oyster consists of calcium carbonate and a small amount of organic matrix. Despite many studies of the shell matrix proteins, the mechanism by which calcium elements are transported from the mantle to the shell remains unclear. Investigating the molecular mechanism of calcium transportation, we prepared artificial seawater with a high concentration of calcium ions (10ASW) to induce calcification in the pearl oyster. When pearl oysters were cultured in 10ASW, unusual nanoparticles were precipitated on the surface of the nacreous layer. SDS-PAGE and 2D-PAGE analyses revealed that some calcium-sensing proteins (Sarcoplasmic Ca-binding Protein (Pf-SCP) and Pf-filamin A) might be related to the synthesis of these nanoparticles. The recombinant proteins of Pf-SCP can bind to calcium ions and accumulate nanoparticles of calcium carbonate crystals. However, transcriptomic analysis of the pearl oysters grown in 10ASW showed that the matrix protein genes in the shell did not differ before and after treatment with 10ASW. These results suggest that, despite increasing calcium transportation to the shell, treatment with a high concentration of calcium ions does not induce formation of the organic framework in the shell microstructure. These findings offer meaningful insights into the transportation of calcium elements from the mantle to the shell.

AB In this work, TiVCrZrHf high entropy alloy ultrathin films were deposited on Si/SiO2 substrate as diffusion barrier layers of Cu thin films by magnetron sputtering. The microstructure and texture of TiVCrZrHf/Cu thin films during annealing were investigated. The experimental results show that the TiVCrZrHf films could retard interdiffusion in Cu thin films upon annealing up to 600 degrees C, and retain stable amorphous structure due to their high entropy and limited diffusion kinetic. The rapid diffusion paths occurred in barrier layer caused by the crystallization of TiVCrZrHf films after annealing at 700 degrees C. Interdiffusion between Cu and Si though the TiVCrZrHf barriers defects and grain boundaries occurred at 700 degrees C, and the Cu3Si phase was thus formed. Moreover, an extremely sharp {1 1 1} fiber texture on TiVCrZrHf barrier layer was formed in Cu thin film. Thus, the excellent thermal and structural stabilities of TiVCrZrHf film revealed it to be a potential candidate barrier material for Cu interconnects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this research, fine-grained SnO2-based varistors with a simple microstructure and the mean grain size of 0.8 mu m were obtained by the microwave sintering method. The breakdown electric field measured for these varistors was 12 kV/cm that is 3 times higher than the conventional-sintered varistors. The high nonlinear coefficient (60) and low leakage current density (9 mu A/cm(2)) were achieved in fine-grained SnO2 varistors. The fine-grained SnO2 varistors appropriately clamped pulse current surges and the calculated value of the clamping voltage ratio of these varistors was 2. The excellent electrical properties and protective effect of fine-grained SnO2 varistors showed that these varistors are astonishingly suitable for ultra-high voltage applications.

AB Au-Ag nanosponges have been investigated by previous research, however, SERS performance of the material has not been studied systematically. Herein, experiments with different Ag deposition cycle durations (up to 12 cycles) were conducted to obtain substrates with varying Ag content. Rhodamine 6G and (Bu4N)(2)[Ru(dcbpyH)(2)-(NCS)(2)] were used to investigate the SERS performance of different substrates. The most intense enhancement Raman spectrum was observed on Au-Ag hybrid nanosponges substrate after 1 cycle of Ag deposition. The peak intensities of R6G and N719 on the substrate reach 25 and 7 times higher values, respectively, than those on Au-Ag alloy nanoparticles substrate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-efficiency absorbent is a prerequisite for CO2 capture from the atmosphere to alleviate environmental degradation. Herein, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) was used to investigate the CO2 adsorption and separation behaviors in four alkyl anime functionalized triphenylamine-based covalent organic frameworks (TPA-xC-NH2, x = 1-4). Results show that a longer alkyl anime chain has a more remarkable effect on the CO2 adsorption capacity and separation over N-2. The alkyl amine chain owning four carbon atoms of TPA-4C-NH2 exhibits the best performance. The CO2 adsorption capacity in TPA-4C-NH2 is 3.41 mmol/g at 298 K and 5.26 mmol/g at 273 K and 1 bar, thereby enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity by 50.2% and 30.5%, respectively, with a 121% selectivity increase compared with that of the pristine TPA-COF. The pore characteristic, isosteric heat, coulomb/non-coulomb interaction, and selectivity are analyzed to elucidate the enhancement mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB kaolinite nanotubes (KNTs) were firstly used to coload TiO2 nanoparticles and carbon nitride (C3N4) nanosheets for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. The influence of C3N4 amount on the photocatalytic activity of composites was evaluated. The optimum sample showed an ultrahigh efficiency/effective mass ratio that is 18.8 and 24.7 times higher than these of pure TiO(2 )and C3N4 references, respectively. The enhancement of photocatalytic performance for clay-semiconductor composites can be attributed to the Z-scheme transport of photoproduced electrons and the good dispersion of catalyst particles on KNTs. The work provides an example that KNTs can be used as a promising support with very little catalysts but high photocatalytic performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work aims at developing an energy-efficient process for production of high strength hot-rolled quenching and partitioning (Q&P) steel. A novel processing strategy involving quenching above martensite start temperature (M-s) in combination with dynamic carbon partitioning is first proposed for hot-rolled Q&P process. The alloy 0.25C-3Mn-2Al (wt%) was intentionally designed to low interface mobility during slow cooling in bainite range and thus controlled partial bainite transformation. Finally, multi-phases containing ferrite, martensite and nano-sized retained austenite were obtained and an improved mechanical property can be achieved with tensile strength similar to 1096 MPa and uniform elongation similar to 16%. This work breaks the Q&P constraint with quenching temperature below M-s and provides an easy-industrialized processing route. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Activated carbons (ACs) were prepared by drying at temperatures of 60-285 degrees C before microwave-assisted activation to investigate effects of predying on their properties. The predrying affected ACs' P-containing functional groups, structural defects, and textural properties. The mesopore volume, total pore volume, and BET surface area of ACs peaked when predrying temperature was 250 degrees C (1.05 mL/g, 1.26 mL/g, and 1509 m(2)/g), mainly because predrying changed microwave activation temperature. The mesopore volume ranked among the highest values ever reported for ACs prepared by microwave activation with P-containing agents; the corresponding mesopore fraction (83.3%) was also large, compared with that of many reported ACs. The drying before microwave activation is an effective strategy to prepare ACs with both superior mesopore volume and high mesopore fraction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydroxyapatite nanocrystals were synthesized by wet chemical precipitation using bio-waste shells of mollusk (clam and mussel) and egg as feedstock materials. The powdered shells were calcined, dissolved in water, and the resulting product was reacted with phosphoric acid. X-ray diffraction analysis identified pure phase of hydroxyapatite for the three different raw materials. Transmission electron microscopy observations of hydroxyapatite indicated that rod-like crystals were produced in nanometric scale, which showed pH-dependent surface charges using zeta potential analysis. Overall, this study proved that calcium-rich bio-wastes are valuable materials to be used as feedstock for production of high purity and economically feasible hydroxyapatite nanocrystals for biomedical and technological applications.

AB We have found that monosodium glutamate, a common food additive, combines with neodymium(III) chloride to form a gel-like luminescent material. Preliminary rheology tests suggest that arrested phase separation causes the material's gel behavior at high test frequencies. Luminescence spectra showed not only the expected Nd3+ emissions (upon 582 nm excitation) but also a broad emission in the infrared with maximum on 980 nm (upon 289 nm excitation), preliminarily assigned to a matrix effect.

AB To overcome the drawback of UV light response in La2Ti2O7 nanosheets, novel up-conversion carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with visible light response have been introduced on the surface of La2Ti2O7 for efficient enhancement of photocatalytic performance. The resulted CQDs/La2Ti2O7 samples were characterized by XRD, TEM, FT-IR, XPS and UV-vis, respectively. Rhodamine B (RhB) solution was chosen as the target organic pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The results indicated that 5 wt% loading of CQDs composite exhibited the best performance. Both the up-converted photoluminescence behavior and their electron capturing ability of CQDs are considered as the main reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic abilities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Two-dimensional (2D) ceria nanoflakes with a thickness of similar to 2 nm were successfully synthesized by cobalt doping via a one-step hydrothermal method. SEM, TEM, AFM, XRD and FT-IR were employed to reveal the morphologies and structures of the products. The results showed that the introduction of Co dopants was critical for the formation of unique 2D nanoflakes structure in this system and it is believed that nanoflakes were formed through a Co induced 2D self-assemble of small ceria nanocrystals based on the oriented attachment. In addition, the nanoflakes Co-CeO2 showed high catalytic activity for mercury oxidation due to the abundant oxygen defects, which was confirmed by the oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O-2-TPD) and Photoluminescence (PL) spectra. This work has provided new strategy of design and preparation of ceria nanomaterials with high catalytic activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A highly transparent self-cleaning superhydrophobic surface was constructed via a facile and environmentally friendly strategy by using biomass-based polyurethane and fused SiO2 nanoparticles. By simply controlling the amounts of castor oil (CO) and SiO2, the coating presented excellent superhydrophobic with high water contact angle (158.5 degrees) and low sliding angle (3.9 degrees), as well as the transmittance of the coating was above 80% in visible-light region. Moreover, the coatings showed remarkable robustness against abrasion of 5 cycles without an apparent decrease of superhydrophobicity and possessed excellent self-cleaning properties against dirty contaminant. Therefore, such transparent and self-cleaning superhydrophobic coating could make it an ideal material for application in optoelectronics, liquid-repellent coatings, and oil-water separation.

AB Innovative Cu/Al clad composites with unique sequencing were rotary swaged at 20 degrees C and 250 degrees C with various swaging degrees. The analyses carried out by electron microscopies and neutron diffraction focused on deformation behaviour of the component metals, grains orientations, occurrence of residual stress and possible development of intermetallic phases on the interfaces. The results showed the swaging temperature and total imposed strain to have significant influences on all the investigated parameters. The Al wires cross-sections within the composites were affected by the increasing total imposed strain more at 250 degrees C, these composites also exhibited formation of intermetallics at higher swaging degrees. However, according to the neutron diffraction results, all the swaged composites experienced structure restoration resulting in residual stress relaxation despite the fact that they exhibited texture formation. Rotary swaging was proven to be applicable for production of Cu/Al clad composite wires in the industrial scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we report a facile way to fabricate fluorescent spherical photonic crystals (SPCs) microspheres for the first time. The SPCs microspheres immobilizing Photonic Bandgap (PBG) structure into a hydrogel framework, which can be used to uptake nanosized CdTe NCs particles based on their reversible volume phase transition behavior. Moreover, the resultant SPCs microspheres can not only monitor surrounding humidity, but also exhibit well integration of fluorescence and PBG color in a single structure. More interestingly, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of fluorescent SPCs microspheres are angle-independent on the curved surface which would open a novel insight into the fabrication of multifunctional optical devices based on PBG and PL functionalities.

AB Black-ZrO2 thin films were successfully fabricated on the surface of a Zr metal plate by simple oxidation at a controlled temperature in air, under normal atmospheric pressure. The black-ZrO2 thin films were composed of two types of grains with monoclinic ZrO2 structures: 1) fine equiaxed grains with sizes of up to a few hundred nanometers from the surface to a depth of about 5 mu m; 2) columnar grains, with long and short diameters of several microns and a few hundred nanometers, respectively, in the inner region above the equiaxed grains. The bandgap of the black-ZrO2 thin films was estimated to be 0.72 eV, based on the Tauc plot using diffuse reflections, which allowed for absorption in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the solar spectrum.

AB Fabrication of wide band-gap (E-g) CuGaSe2 (CGSe) thin film solar cells with large area uniformity and good reproducibility is difficult, which is crucial for tandem cells. In this work, a method was proposed and investigated to overcome this problem. CGSe solar cells were fabricated by sputtering from a ternary CGSe target and post selenization treatment at different temperatures. After selenization, the CGSe grains grow up gradually, and the copper-poor and selenium-rich CGSe absorbers are obtained successfully. The X-ray diffraction peaks are all corresponded to CGSe phase. As the temperature increases from 530 to 570 degrees C, the average efficiency increases from 1.57% to 3.11%. When the temperature reaches 590 degrees C, the efficiency drops to 2.38%. The champion device obtained at 570 degrees C shows an E-g of 1.66 eV and an efficiency of 3.21%, which indicates the potential for the top cell in tandem solar cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (MePEG-PCL) nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated using an emulsion solvent evaporation technique, aiming at improving the limited clinical application of Saikosaponin-a (SSa) due to its poor water solubility and hemolysis. The mean diameter of SSa loaded MePEG-PCL NPs (MePEG-PCL@SSa) were determined to be 97.02 +/- 1.17 nm. The results of H-1 NMR confirmed the core-shell structure of NPs. In vitro release of SSa from MePEG-PCL@SSa NPs was a sustained manner with no apparent initial drug burst. The hemolysis and cytotoxicity of MePEG-PCL@SSa were investigated with Red Blood Cells (RBC) and bEnd.3 cells, respectively. The results displayed that hemolysis reduced greatly (3.26 +/- 0.17% at high NPs concentration), and the cytotoxicity was not seriously observed. Our findings provided a promising method to develop a SSa formulation for the potential clinical application. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Microfluidic spinning technology (MST) employed for the fabrication of microfibers is an emerging material fabrication method of great scientific interest. To achieve high-strength properties of the fabricated reinforced microfibers, the nanostructure must be tunable. Herein we present a process combining hydrodynamic alignment (HA) and MST to synthesize microfibers with different diameters in a multi-phase coaxial flow. The preferential macromolecule orientation along the microfiber forming direction and its diameter was tuned by varying the process parameters. The tensile test revealed that the maximum strength of the fabricated calcium alginate microfiber reached 185.1 MPa, whereas the microfibers were found to have consistent and uniform size with an average diameter of 31.3 mu m. Successful HA at higher flow rates prior to gelation caused a decrease in the diameter of the microfiber. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This report provides the first quantitative evaluation and prediction of residual stress arising from a single particle deposition in the metal cold spray of Ti-6Al-4V. Micro-ring-core Focused Ion Beam-Digital Image Correlation (FIB-DIC) technique is employed to determine the residual stress variation experimentally, while finite element simulation with Johnson-Cook plasticity and dynamic failure model is employed to numerically predict the residual stress distribution within single particle, and they show good agreement with each other for different impact velocities. This provides a tight link between the validated description of microscopic phenomena and the ensuing macroscopic properties and processes of the deposit. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FACILE PREPARATION
AB Conductive polymer composite (CPC) foams have been considered as a promising electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials because of the advantages of the lightweight, low-cost and easy preparation process. However, most of the currently reported CPC foams were prepared by batch foaming process. Insight of large-scale and low-cost production of CPC foams, we presented a feasible extrusion foaming strategy of polystyrene (PS) composites with micro-graphite (mGr) or multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) using supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO2) as the physical blowing agent for EMI shielding application. The composite foams showed elongated cell morphology; meanwhile, the compressive strength and electrical conductivity were significantly increased. These composite foams presented a remarkable high performance of EMI shielding efficiency, corresponding average EMI SE of 22 dB and specific EMI SE of 92 dB/(g/cm(3)). In comparison between mGr and MWCNT, PS/mGr composite foams showed better EMI SE than that of PS/MWCNT composite foams at the same filler content due to the lower foam density of PS/mGr composite foams. Considering the feasible, large-scale and low-cost production process, these CPC foams are expected to apply in high performance EMI shielding areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel La2NiO4+delta-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 dual-phase hollow fiber membrane was developed via a combined phase inversion-sintering process. The enhanced O-2-permeability is due to the existence of LNO and SDC interface crossing the composite membrane not only from the surface, but also from the bulkiness, which greatly promotes the oxygen ionic transport rates. Such dual-phase membrane shows great CO2-resistance without sacrificing the oxygen permeation flux value when swept by pure CO2 compared with helium. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SPIN-RESONANCE; MOLECULES; METALS
AB This work presents the effect of switching of resistivity of activated carbon fibers, obtained with a combination of adsorption of specific molecules and application of external electric field. Observed resistivity jumps were due to the ordering of dipolar guest molecules which acted as a gating factor for transport of charge carriers within the granular structure of the fiber. Presented research shows that the control of electrical transport in porous carbon systems is possible by means of structure, host-guest interactions and temperature, combined with external stimulation. As such it is important for fundamental understanding of electronic properties of graphene-based systems, and for their adsorption-related applications, for example energy generation and storage. Resistivity switching might prove useful for tuning of carrier transport in nanoelectronic units (single-electron transistors, spin valves) or for enhancing the performance of molecular sensors.

AB A novel synthetic strategy was successfully developed to fabricate mesoporous biochar with high-surface area from crab shell as carbon precursor and its natural CaCO3 as in situ template. The influences of pyrolysis temperature on the pore structure were investigated via N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and scanning/transmission electron microscope. The as-prepared biochar at pyrolysis temperature of 900 degrees C possessed high surface area of 634 m(2)/g and large mesopore percentage of 70.80%. The maximum specific capacitance of biochar electrode reached 220 F/g. The excellent supercapacitor performance of this supercapacitor was strongly attributed to the thermal decomposition of CaCO3, producing high surface area and mesoporous structure for raw biochar.

AB GeTe and SnTe based materials are emerging as viable alternatives for toxic PbTe based thermoelectric materials. Here, a systematic study of thermoelectric properties of Bi and In codoped GeTe, and Sb, In and Ag codoped SnTe alloys processed by Spark Plasma Sintering are presented. We report that codoping of Bi and In to GeTe, (i) enhances the thermoelectric performance by the synergistic effect of nanostructuring, suppression of carrier density and creation of resonant level, which enables to simultaneously enhance the thermopower and reduce the thermal transport, and (ii) promotes the R3m -> Fm-3m structural transition. These cumulative effects help Ge0.93Bi0.05In0.02Te to maintain the peak figure of merit, zT similar to 0.85 over a wide spectrum of temperature from 550 to 773 K, making them a serious candidate for device fabrications. We also report that Sb and In codoping in SnTe enhances the thermoelectric performance, as Sn0.845Sb0.15In0.005Te exhibits an improved zT similar to 0.8 at 823 K, when compared to pristine SnTe.

AB This work reports on the use of graphite as dispersoid to strengthen Cu. Material processing involved two-stage cycles of ball milling and spark plasma sintering, respectively for the dispersion of graphite nanoparticles into nanostructured Cu and the formation of dense compacts with relatively large Cu grains. The 3 wt% of graphite allows progressive hardening and stiffening of the Cu-graphite composite, showing the potential of graphite as effective dispersoid upon suitable processing.

TI ZnO nanoparticles enhanced hydrophobicity for starch film and paper

ID NANOCOMPOSITE; COMPOSITE
AB Since hydrophobicity can improve the usability and functionality of materials in humid condition, enhancing the hydrophobic behavior of starch films or papers is of importance. In this work, ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were introduced into the starch solution under ultrasonic and magnetic-stirring, followed by cast filming and paper coating. The contact angles of resulting film and coated paper containing 2% (wt) NPs were increased from 85.73 degrees to 121.45 degrees, 64.47 degrees to 103.94 degrees, respectively. The results from comprehensive characterizations confirmed the hierarchical structure created by ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of starch film as well as the formation of intact layers on coated paper. The excellent miscibility between starch and ZnO NPs was also achieved. The approach developed is promising and facilitates the hydrophobic modification of green-based materials.

AB Fluorinated silica nanoparticles (F-SiO2 NPs) were prepared by sol-gel method, and anchored on the surface of loofah sponge, so fabricating a novel three-dimensional (3D) superhydrophobic material. The morphology, chemical composition and wettability of the surface of the as-modified loofah sponge were characterized and compared with those of unmodified loofah sponge. The water contact angle (WCA) on the surface of modified loofah sponge is as high as 156 degrees. Such a 3D superhydrophobic loofah sponge can immediately remove oil from the oil/water mixture. It implies that the low-cost and renewable loofah sponge can be effectively utilized as a novel 3D superhydrophobic material for oil/water separation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
