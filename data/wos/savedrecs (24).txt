AB Human blood monocytes are divided into populations based on the differential expression of CD14 and CD16 receptors: CD14 (+) CD16(classical), CD14 (+) CD16 (+) (intermediate), and CD14(-)CD16(+) (non-classical). Given their functional differences and their role in pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), monocyte profiling is of clinical interest. Here we investigated blood monocyte subsets in clinically stable COPD patients with alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (PiZZ, n = 7) and with normal AAT variant (PiMM, n = 7). Peripheral whole blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes and incubated with LPS (from E. coli; 1 mu g/ml) or placebo for 6 h at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2. To profile monocyte subsets we performed flow cytometry analysis based on HLA-DR and CD14/CD16 staining. HLA-DR + subsets of cells did not differ between PiZZ and PiMM COPD, and healthy controls (n = 7), used as a reference. Monocyte profiling, which express the CD14 and CD16, but not the HLA-DR (HLA-DR-) showed that intermediate monocytes subset was lowest in PiZZ group, and almost totally disappeared from blood treated with LPS. The non-classical subset was almost absent in PiZZ patients independently of LPS treatment. Recent studies demonstrate that non-classical monocytes exhibit a unique ability to protect the vascular endothelium under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions whereas intermediate monocytes are recruited at a later stage of inflammation, and are associated with secretion of cytokines/chemokines and wound healing. Evident alterations in blood monocyte subsets together with a partial reduction of AAT levels, an important anti-inflammatory protein, can be key factors for the early manifestation of emphysema in some PiZZ AATD carriers.

AB There is no reliable estimate of burden of snakebite-envenoming (SBE) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We derived from a meta-analysis the burden of SBE related deaths, amputations and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in 41 countries in SSA. The annual burden was estimated at 1.03 million DALYs (95% Confidence Interval: 0.80-1.28 million DALYs). This is similar to or higher than the burden of many Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) and the finding advocates for a commensurate resources allocation towards control of SBE.

AB Envenomation by scorpions of the genus Tityus is an important public health problem in Argentina, involving near 8000 stings and 2 deaths each year. Treatment for envenomation is the use of specific antivenom and intensive hospital care. Antivenom is produced by the Ministry of Health and freely distributed throughout the country. For antivenom production it is necessary to collect scorpion venom, which is a difficult task because although scorpions can be found in Argentina, they are less abundant than in warmer latitudes. For this reason venom collection constitutes a bottleneck for antivenom production. Although in Argentina several species of Tityus can be found, most of the accidents are caused by Tityus trivittatus, and the venom of this scorpion has historically been the venom used for antivenom production. We analyzed retrospectively 26 pools of telson homogenates (6964 telsons) and 37 pools of milked venom obtained by electrical stimulation (equivalent to 6841 milkings). Lethal potencies of samples from different provinces were very similar, although venom from scorpions of Buenos Aires city showed the lowest potency. The venom obtained by milking (median LD50 12.3 mu g), provided batches containing LD(50)s more potent when compared with the venom obtained from telson homogenates (p < 0.0001). Many batches of telson homogenates (30%) showed lower potencies than acceptable for antivenom production and control. In addition to the study of the venom yield, the records of immunization of horses, the potency of the batches and the protein content of each batch of anti-scorpion antivenom produced were analyzed, comparing those produced using milked venom with those using telson homogenates as immunogens. Batches produced using milked venom required a shorter period of immunization (p < 0.0001), rendered higher neutralizing titers (p 0.0350) and possessed lower protein content (p 0.0092). Results clearly showed that the milking of scorpions is a more efficient tool to obtain venom for antivenom production in comparison to the use of telson homogenates.

AB Among the diverse toxic components produced by cyanobacteria, microcystins (MCs) are one of the most toxic and notorious cyanotoxin groups. Besides their potent hepatotoxicity, MCs have been revealed to induce potential reproductive toxicity in various animal studies. However, little is still known regarding the distribution of MCs in the reproductive organ, which could directly affect reproductive cells. In order to respond to this question, an acute study was conducted in adult medaka fish (model animal) gavaged with 10 mu g.g(-1) body weight of pure MC-LR. The histological and immunohistochemical examinations reveal an intense distribution of MC-LR within hepatocytes along with a severe liver lesion in the toxin-treated female and male fish. Besides being accumulated in the hepatocytes, MC-LR was also found in the connective tissue of the ovary and the testis, as well as in oocytes and degenerative spermatocyte-like structures but not spermatocytes. Both liver and gonad play important roles in the reproductive process of oviparous vertebrates. This observation constitutes the first observation of the presence of MC-LR in reproductive cells (female, oocytes) of a vertebrate model with in vivo study. Our results, which provide intracellular localization of MC-LR in the gonad, advance our understanding of the potential reproductive toxicity of MC-LR in fish.

AB Leucurogin is an ECD disintegrin-like protein, cloned from Bothrops leucurus venom gland. This new protein, encompassing the disintegrin region of a PIII metalloproteinase, is produced by recombinant technology and its biological and functional activity was partially characterized in this study. Biological activity was characterized in vitro using human fibroblasts. Functional activity of leucurogin was analysed in vitro and in vivo with murine B16F10 Nex-2 and human melanoma BLM cells. The results show that leucurogin inhibits cellular processes dependent on collagen type I. In a competition assay with collagen, leucurogin inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, the adhesion of fibroblast to collagen. At 10 mu M leucurogin reduces adhesion (40%) and migration (70%) of hFb and inhibits migration (32%) and proliferation (65%) of BLM cells. At 2.5 mu M leucurogin inhibits 80% cell proliferation of B16F10 Nex-2 melanoma cells. At 4.8 mu M leucurogin inhibits, in vitro, the vascular structures formation by endothelial cells by 66%. Leucurogin, injected intraperitoneally, i.p. (5 mu g/animal, two-month old C57/B16 male mice) on alternate days for 15 days, inhibits lung metastasis of Bl6F10 Nex-2 cells by 70-75%. In the treatment of human melanoma, grafted intradermally in the nude mice flank, leucurogin (7.5 mu g/ kg in alternate days during 17 days) inhibits tumor growth by more than 40%. Leucurogin can be considered a promising agent for melanoma treatment.

AB Searching for Amnesic (ASP), Paralytic (PSP) and Lipophilic (LT) toxins in seafood is of great importance for consumer protection. Studies are usually focused on the most aquacultured species, the mussel. But, there are a number of potentially commercially important shellfish species as rough cockle Acanthocardia tuberculata (Linnaeus, 1758) and smooth clam Callista chione (Linnaeus, 1758) which are common in the Croatian Adriatic Sea. Investigation of marine biotoxins accumulation in these two species of shellfish from the Adriatic Sea has not been conducted up to now. In order to detect the potential marine biotoxin profile of A. tuberculata and C. chione wild populations, samples were taken monthly during one-year survey from the estuarine area in the central Adriatic Sea. HPLC-FLD with pre-column oxidation and HPLC-UV-DAD methods were employed for PSP and ASP toxins determination, respectively, while LTs were determined by LC-MS/MS. This research had revealed the differences in the accumulation of ASP, PSP and LT toxins between the two studied species, as Acanthocardia tuberculata showed more diverse profile with higher concentrations of analysed toxins. Both investigated shellfish species had shown levels of these biotoxins under the legal limits set by the European Commission.

AB The South African coral snake (Aspidelaps lubricus, Elapidae) has not previously been reported to cause any neurotoxic envenomations in humans. We recently treated a 44-year-old man who was bitten twice, once in each hand, by a captive South African coral snake (Aspidelaps lubricus) while feeding the female snake who had recently laid eggs. Approximately one hour after receiving the bite, he developed vomiting, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and paralysis of the bulbar and upper extremity muscles, with retention of voluntary motor control in the lower extremities. Supportive care was provided, and paralysis and respiratory failure resolved spontaneously 12 hours after onset. No antivenom for this species is available. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of significant human envenomation by Aspidelaps lubricus. Physicians, first responders, and herpetologists should be aware of the potential for neurotoxicity in humans.

ID TRPV1
AB Complex regional pain syndrome (CAPS) is characterized by hyperalgesia, autonomic and trophic alterations of bones, muscles and skin. It is supported by neurogenic inflammation and impairment of sympathetic nervous system. Botulinum Toxin (BTX) is an option for the management of pain, with level B evidence of efficacy in neuropathic, joint and myofascial pain syndrome. We report a case of CRPS treated with intra articular injection of BTX-A (IaBI). BTX-A 100 U in 2 cc Na Cl 0,9% was injected into the gleno-humeral joint. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) were administered at T0 (baseline), T1 (one month after IaBI) and T2 (four months after IaBI). Autonomic and trophic skin disorders were clinically monitored. Pain decreased at T1, with a lasting effect at T2, associated with improvement of range of motion (ROM). No improvement in terms of autonomic and trophic skin disorders were reported neither at T1 nor T2. These findings support a possible antinociceptive role of BTX-A in the management of CRPS pain related to inhibition of pain neurotransmitters release. A literature revision of IaBI is provided.

AB Background: Scorpion envenomation and its consequences represented a serious healthcare problem in Upper Egypt and considered to be an important cause of life-threatening emergency particularly in children.
   Methods: One hundred patients presented to the emergency department of Assiut University Children Hospital with a history of scorpion sting aged less than 18 years were included in our randomized comparative trial during 2016. Two groups of patients were randomly categorized according to the route of administration of scorpion antivenom; intramuscular and intravenous with 50 patients in each group. Full history, clinical examination, and routine baseline investigations were performed.
   Results: Myocarditis, encephalopathy, cardiogenic shock, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, mean hospital stay and mortality were significantly lower in those received intravenous antivenom compared with those received intramuscular one.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study and other experimental and clinical trials confirmed that the administration of the scorpion antivenom by intravenous route has a lower incidence of systemic toxicity, a better outcome of fatal complication resulted from envenomation especially cardiogenic shock, decreased need for ICU facilities and mechanical ventilation, shorter hospital stay, and better overall outcome than the intramuscular route.

AB Victims of Bothrops jararaca snakebites manifest bleedings, blood incoagulability, platelet dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia, and the latter has been directly implicated in the genesis of hemorrhagic diathesis. We addressed herein the direct effects of B. jararaca venom (BjV) on ex vivo platelet aggregation and granule secretion in washed human and mouse platelets. BjV directly aggregated platelets, but the extent of platelet aggregation was lower in human than mouse platelets. On the other hand, BjV (24.4 mu g/mL) and thrombin (0.1 U/mL) induced a similar extent of ATP and platelet factor 4 (PF4) secretion in both species. BjV-induced platelet aggregation was independent of the platelet dense body content, as in pearl mouse (Ap3b1(-/-))platelets, whose dense bodies are deficient in adenine nucleotides and serotonin, the extent of platelet aggregation was superior to that induced in BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice. BjV-induced beta-hexosaminidase secretion in human platelets was less intense than that evoked by thrombin, and the contrary was observed in mouse platelets. Irreversible inactivation of platelet cyclooxygenase 1 by acetylsalicylic acid did not reduce BjV-induced platelet aggregation. BjV exerted no cytotoxic activity in human and mouse platelets, as evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase loss. Eptifibatide, which inhibits the binding of fibrinogen to platelet glycoprotein complex GPIIb-IIIa, differently blocked BjV-induced platelet aggregation in mice and humans. BjV-induced platelet aggregation did not depend on snake venom serine proteinases nor metalloproteinases in mice, whilst serine proteinases were rather important for platelet aggregation in humans. Our results show that BjV induces direct activation, aggregation, and secretion in human and mouse platelets, but it exerts diverse responses in them, which should be considered in comparative studies to understand pathophysiological events during Bothrops envenomation.

AB We investigate how ideas from covariance localization in numerical weather prediction can be used in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of high-dimensional posterior distributions arising in Bayesian inverse problems. To localize an inverse problem is to enforce an anticipated "local" structure by (i) neglecting small off-diagonal elements of the prior precision and covariance matrices; and (ii) restricting the influence of observations to their neighborhood. For linear problems we can specify the conditions under which posterior moments of the localized problem are close to those of the original problem. We explain physical interpretations of our assumptions about local structure and discuss the notion of high dimensionality in local problems, which is different from the usual notion of high dimensionality in function space MCMC. The Gibbs sampler is a natural choice of MCMC algorithm for localized inverse problems and we demonstrate that its convergence rate is independent of dimension for localized linear problems. Nonlinear problems can also be tackled efficiently by localization and, as a simple illustration of these ideas, we present a localized Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler. Several linear and nonlinear numerical examples illustrate localization in the context of MCMC samplers for inverse problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Basis adaptation in Homogeneous Chaos spaces rely on a suitable rotation of the underlying Gaussian germ. Several rotations have been proposed in the literature resulting in adaptations with different convergence properties. In this paper we present a new adaptation mechanism that builds on compressive sensing algorithms, resulting in a reduced polynomial chaos approximation with optimal sparsity. The developed adaptation algorithm consists of a two-step optimization procedure that computes the optimal coefficients and the input projection matrix of a low dimensional chaos expansion with respect to an optimally rotated basis. We demonstrate the attractive features of our algorithm through several numerical examples including the application on Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) calculations of turbulent combustion in a HIFiRE scramjet engine.

AB We introduce a numerical framework that enables unprecedented direct numerical studies of the electropermeabilization effects of a cell aggregate at the meso-scale. Our simulations qualitatively replicate the shadowing effect observed in experiments and reproduce the time evolution of the impedance of the cell sample in agreement with the trends observed in experiments. This approach sets the scene for performing homogenization studies for understanding the effect of tissue environment on the efficiency of electropermeabilization. We employ a forest of Octree grids along with a Voronoi mesh in a parallel environment that exhibits excellent scalability. We exploit the electric interactions between the cells through a nonlinear phenomenological model that is generalized to account for the permeability of the cell membranes. We use the Voronoi Interface Method (VIM) to accurately capture the sharp jump in the electric potential on the cell boundaries. The case study simulation covers a volume of (1 mm)(3) with more than 27,000 well-resolved cells with a heterogeneous mix of morphologies that are randomly distributed throughout a spheroid region.

AB In this paper, a third-order reconstructed DG(p(1)p(2)) method based on the variational reconstruction (VR) (Wang et al., 2017 [24]) is developed for simulating the two dimensional steady-state compressible flows on unstructured and hybrid grids. The proposed method combines the advantages of the DG discretization with the flexibility of the variational reconstruction, which exhibits its superior potential in enhancing the level of accuracy compared to the underlying DG method. In this variational rDG(p(1)p(2)) method, the low order degrees of freedom are evolved through the underlying DG(p(1)) method, while the high order degrees of freedom are reconstructed through the variational reconstruction, in which the constitutive relations are built by minimizing the so-called 'cost function'. The cost function is defined by the total interfacial jump integration in the computational domain using the variational method. The large sparse linear system resulted by the variational reconstruction is solved in an efficient way coupled with the temporal discretization for the steady-state simulations. A number of test cases are presented to assess the performance of the new high order variational rDG(p(1)p(2)) method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Stability of energy stable flux reconstruction for the diffusion problem

AB The flux reconstruction (FR) method has gained popularity within the research community. The approach has been demonstrated to recover high-order methods such as the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. Stability analyses have been conducted for a linear advection problem leading to the energy stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) methods also named Vincent-Castonguay-Jameson-Huynh (VCJH) methods. ESFR schemes can be viewed as DG schemes with modally filtered correction fields. Using this class of methods, the linear advection diffusion problem has been shown to be stable using the local discontinuous Galerkin scheme (LDG) to compute the viscous numerical flux. This stability proof has been extended for linear triangular and tetrahedra elements. Although the LDG scheme is commonly used, it requires, on particular meshes, a wide stencil, which raises the computational cost.
   As a consequence, many prefer the compact interior penalty (IP) or the Bassi and Rebay II (BR2) numerical fluxes. This article, for the first time, derives, for both schemes, a condition on the penalty term to ensure the stability for the linear diffusion equation. The derivations are based on Gauss Legendre flux points and on periodic boundary conditions. Moreover the article proposes that for both the IP and BR2 numerical fluxes, the stability of the ESFR scheme is independent of the auxiliary correction field. A von Neumann analysis is conducted to study the maximal time step of various ESFR methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The level set method for modeling multi-fluid interfaces gives a simple approach for the simulation of multiphase flow problems. However, many of the components of this method, such as the redistancing of the level set function and discretization of the singular surface tension force, become more difficult on unstructured meshes in a control volume framework; furthermore, these operations are shown to lead to errors in conservation of mass of the individual phases, as well as unphysical currents near the interface. This paper presents a novel formulation for the level set method combined with a balanced-force algorithm using a control volume finite element method (CVFEM) for unstructured grids. A diffuse interface description is used, allowing a straightforward inclusion of surface tension forces; we show that by consistently evaluating the pressure gradient and surface tension, we are able to discretely balance these two forces and suppress any parasitic currents given a prescribed curvature. By converting the redistancing equation to a form that is suitable for CVFEM and enforcing a constraint directly linked with the phase fraction in each cell, we are able conserve mass and preserve the shape of the interface to a high degree of accuracy in multiphase flow problems with high density and viscosity ratios. The accuracy of the of our proposed method is assessed by comparing with benchmark results from the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For situations where reservoir management based on developing and running a full-scale reservoir simulation model is not plausible, data-driven models may provide an attractive alternative. Recently, we developed a simple data-driven model, INSIM-FT for reservoir flow and transport as a replacement for a reservoir simulator. However, INSIM-FT only considers two-dimensional flow in a reservoir that contains only vertical wells. In this work, we develop a new data-driven model that extends the interwell numerical simulation model with front-tracking (INSIM-FT) from single-layer reservoirs to full three-dimensional (3D) multi-layer reservoirs. The new model, which is referred to as INSIM-FT-3D, can be used for history matching and reservoir performance predictions for a three-dimensional reservoir under waterflooding. The novelty of the new approach includes: (1) INSIM-FT-3D replaces the original Riemann solver in INSIM-FT by a new Riemann solver based on a convex-hull method that enables the solution of the Buckley-Leverett problem with gravity; (2) unlike the original INSIM-FT model, which assumes all wells are vertical, the INSIM-FT-3D model allows for the inclusion of wells with arbitrary trajectories with multiple perforations; (3) INSIM-FT-3D applies Mitchell's best-candidate algorithm to automatically generate the imaginary wells that are evenly distributed in the reservoir given a set of prefixed actual well nodes and (4) INSIM-FT-3D utilizes our own modification of Delaunay triangulation to build the 3D connection map necessary to use the general INSIM-FT-3D formulation. History matching of the INSIM-FT-3D model parameters is performed using the ensemble-smoother with multiple data assimilations. The model parameters for history matching include the connection-based parameters, the parameters defining the power-law relative permeabilities and the parameters defining the well indices for the perforated zones of a well with multiple perforated well segments.
   The reliability of the analytical water-saturation solution obtained with INSIM-FT-3D is validated by comparison with corresponding results from an Eclipse [47] model with very fine grids and small time steps. After illustrating the utility and reliability of the method for a three-dimensional synthetic problem, the method is shown to give reasonable history-matching and prediction results for a field example. At last, the proposed method is tested for Brugge field, a field-scale synthetic reservoir simulation model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the reduction of the Langevin equation arising from bio-molecular models. To facilitate the construction and implementation of the reduced models, the problem is formulated as a reduced-order modeling problem. The reduced models can then be directly obtained from a Galerkin projection to appropriately defined Krylov subspaces. The equivalence to a moment-matching procedure, previously implemented in [32], is proved. A particular emphasis is placed on the reduction of the stochastic noise, which is absent in many order-reduction problems. In particular, for order less than six we can show the reduced model obtained from the subspace projection automatically satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Details for the implementations, including a biorthogonalization procedure and the minimization of the number of matrix multiplications, will be discussed as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ID TRANSPORT-EQUATION; APPROXIMATION; SYSTEMS; SOLVER; GMRES
AB We investigate integral formulations and fast algorithms for the steady-state radiative transfer equation with isotropic and anisotropic scattering. When the scattering term is a smooth convolution on the unit sphere, a model reduction step in the angular domain using the Fourier transformation in 2D and the spherical harmonic transformation in 3D significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedoms. The resulting Fourier coefficients or spherical harmonic coefficients satisfy a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. We study the uniqueness of the equation and proved an a priori estimate. For a homogeneous medium, the integral equation can be solved efficiently using the FFT and iterative methods. For an inhomogeneous medium, the recursive skeletonization factorization method is applied instead. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases and for both transport and diffusion regimes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Uncertainty Quantification and Sensitivity Analysis problems are made more difficult in the case of applications involving expensive computer simulations. This is because a limited amount of simulations is available to build a sufficiently accurate metamodel of the quantities of interest.
   In this work, an algorithm for the construction of a low-cost and accurate metamodel is proposed, having in mind computationally expensive applications. It has two main features. First, Universal Kriging is coupled with sparse Polynomial Dimensional Decomposition (PDD) to build a metamodel with improved accuracy. The polynomials selected by the adaptive PDD representation are used as a sparse basis to build a Universal Kriging surrogate model. Secondly, a numerical method, derived from anisotropic mesh adaptation, is formulated in order to adaptively insert a fixed number of new training points to an existing Design of Experiments.
   The convergence of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and assessed on different test functions with an increasing size of the input space. Finally, the algorithm is used to propagate uncertainties in two high-dimensional real problems related to the atmospheric reentry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ADAPTIVE MESH REFINEMENT; NONPARALLEL; FLOWS
AB A new linear wavepacket tracking method is presented that can ultimately be used for efficient transition prediction of hypersonic boundary-layers. The wavepacket tracking method employs higher-order accurate adaptive mesh refinement to track wavepackets that are introduced in the boundary-layer via pulse disturbances. The evolution of these wavepackets is used to extract boundary-layer stability characteristics, such as amplitude curves, growth rates and N-Factor curves, which are commonly used for transition prediction. The efficiency and accuracy of the wavepacket tracking method, for determining the stability characteristics of the flow, strongly depends on the numerical implementation details, such as the refinement criteria, the tracking parameter and refinement function used for adaptive mesh refinement. While the computational expense at one time step of continuous forcing approaches, commonly employed in direct numerical simulations of transitional flows, scales with the size of the geometry of interest, the computational expense for the current adaptive mesh refinement wavepacket tracking method scales with the size of the wavepacket. A detailed description of the adaptive mesh refinement wavepacket tracking (AMR-WPT) method and its computational expense is provided and the method is validated against stability analysis results extracted from direct numerical simulations on static meshes and linear stability theory for a supersonic shear layer and different hypersonic boundary-layer flows.

AB A high order direct discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is proposed in this work for solving the two-dimensional steady and unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations on arbitrary grids. The inviscid term is discretized by using a simplified artificial compressibility flux which can be obtained explicitly and straightforwardly without entailing any numerical iterative procedure for solving a Riemann problem of a nonlinear system. And the viscous term is discretized by the direct DG (DDG) method which was developed based on the weak formulation of the scalar diffusion problems on structured grids. A number of test cases are presented to assess the performance of the DDG method compared to the widely used BR2 method for solving the INS equations. The numerical results indicate that the DDG method can achieve the designed order of accuracy and is able to deliver comparable accuracy as the BR2 method. Due to its simplicity in implementation, the DDG method provides an attractive alternative for solving the INS equations on arbitrary grids. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents a novel proposal of a second-order accurate (in time and space) particle-based method for solving transport equations including incompressible flows problems within a mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. This methodology consists of a symmetrical operator splitting, the use of high-order operators to transfer data between the particles and the background mesh, and an improved version of the eXplicit Integration Following the Streamlines (X-IVS) method. In the case of incompressible flows, a large time-step iterative solver is employed where the momentum equation is split to improve the numerical approximation of the convective term.
   New interpolation and projection operators are evaluated and quadratically accurate solutions of scalar transport tests are presented. Then, incompressible flow problems are solved where the rate of convergence of the method is assessed using both structured and unstructured background grids. The method is implemented in the open source platform OpenFOAM (R) allowing employing arbitrary meshes and obtaining reliable computing time comparisons with standardized solvers. The results obtained reveal that the current method is able to obtain a lower level of error than a fast Eulerian alternative, without increasing the total computing time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB An extension of the von Neumann linear analysis is proposed for the study of the discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation (DVBE) and the lattice Boltzmann (LB) scheme. While the standard technique is restricted to the investigation of the spectral radius and the dissipation and dispersion properties, a new focus is put here on the information carried by the modes. The technique consists in the computation of the moments of the eigenvectors and their projection onto the physical waves expected by the continuous linearized Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. The method is illustrated thanks to some simulations with the BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) collision operator on the D2Q9 and D2V17 lattices. The present analysis reveals the existence of two kinds of modes: non-observable modes that do not carry any macroscopic information and observable modes. The latter may carry either a physical wave expected by the NS equations, or an unphysical information. Further investigation of modal interactions highlights a phenomenon called curve veering occurring between two observable modes: a swap of eigenvectors and dissipation rate is observed between the eigencurves. Increasing the Mach number of the mean flow yields an eigenvalue collision at the origin of numerical instabilities of the BGK model, arising from the error in the time and space discretization of the DVBE.

AB In the article [Yang et al. (2012) [37]], the authors have developed a high order moving mesh WENO method for one-dimensional (1D) hyperbolic conservation laws, which is shown to be effective in resolving shocks and other complex solution structures. In this paper, in the light of the similar moving mesh technique, we develop a novel WENO scheme with non-polynomial bases, in particular, the exponential bases to further improve the performance of WENO schemes for solving 1D conservation laws. Furthermore, we modify the original moving mesh technique by developing a new monitor function as well as a different mesh smoothing strategy. A collection of numerical examples is presented to demonstrate high order accuracy and robustness of the method in capturing smooth and non-smooth solutions including the strong delta shock arising from the weakly hyperbolic pressureless Euler equations.

DE DMD; Full-Orthogonalization-Arnoldi; Error analysis; Parallel; Large

AB A novel technique based on the Full Orthogonalization Arnoldi (FOA) is proposed to perform Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for a sequence of snapshots. A modification to FOA is presented for situations where the matrix A is unknown, but the set of vectors {A(i-1)v(1)}(i=1)(N) are known. The modified FOA is the kernel for the proposed projected DMD algorithm termed, FOA based DMD. The proposed algorithm to compute DMD modes and eigenvalues i) does not require Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for snapshot matrices X with kappa(2)(X) << 1/epsilon(m), where kappa(2) (X) is the 2-norm condition number of the snapshot matrix and epsilon(m) is the relative round-off error or machine epsilon, ii) has an optional rank truncation step motivated by round off error analysis for snapshot matrices X with kappa(2) (X) approximate to 1/epsilon(m), iii) requires only one snapshot at a time, thus making it a 'streaming' method even with the optional rank truncation step, iv) consumes less memory and requires less floating point operations to obtain the projected matrix than existing projected DMD methods and v) lends itself to easy parallelism as the main computational kernel involves only vector additions, dot products and matrix vector products. The new technique is therefore well-suited for DMD of large datasets on parallel computing platforms. We show both theoretically and using numerical examples that for FOA based DMD without rank truncation, the finite precision error in the computed projection of the linear mapping is 0 (epsilon(m)kappa(2) (X)). The proposed method is also compared to existing projected DMD methods for computational cost, memory consumption and relative round off error. Error indicators are presented that are useful to decide when to stop acquiring new snapshots. The proposed method is applied to several examples of numerical simulations of fluid flow.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DE Radial basis functions; RBF; RBF-FD; Cubic polyharmonic splines; PHS;
   Runge's phenomenon
AB Radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) approximations generalize grid-based regular finite differences to scattered node sets. These become particularly effective when they are based on polyharmonic splines (PHS) augmented with multi-variate polynomials (PHS+poly). One key feature is that high orders of accuracy can be achieved without having to choose an optimal shape parameter and without having to deal with issues related to numerical ill-conditioning. The strengths of this approach were previously shown to be especially striking for approximations near domain boundaries, where the stencils become highly one-sided. Due to the polynomial Runge phenomenon, regular FD approximations of high accuracy will in such cases have very large weights well into the domain. The inclusion of PHS-type RBFs in the process of generating weights makes it possible to avoid this adverse effect. With that as motivation, this study aims at gaining a better understanding of the behavior of PHS+poly generated RBF-FD approximations near boundaries, illustrating it in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D.

We present an accurate and computationally efficient rejection method for sampling a given scattering kernel of any isotropic material. The proposed method produces continuous neutron energy and angular distributions, typically using just a single interpolation per sampling. We benchmark the results of this method against those from accurate analytical models and one of the major neutron transport codes. We also show the results of applying this method to the conventional discrete double differential cross sections. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Numerical methods are developed to simulate high temperature gas flow and coupled surface reactions, relevant to porous thermal protection systems used by hypersonic vehicles. Due to the non-continuum nature of these flows, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used, and the computational complexity of the simulations presents a number of unique challenges. Strategies for parallel partitioning, interprocessor communication, complex microstructure geometry representation, cutcell procedures, and parallel file input/output are presented and tested. Algorithms and data structures are developed for a microstructure generation tool called FiberGen that enables realistic microstructures to be constructed based on targeted fiber radius, orientation, and overall porosity, with user defined variations about these values. The data structures and algorithms associated with FiberGen are robust and efficient enough to enable DSMC simulations where the microstructure geometry changes to directly simulate ablation problems. Subsonic boundary conditions are described and validated, and a number of example solutions are presented. The example problems demonstrate the difference between surface ablation and in-depth volume ablation regimes for porous TPS materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Micro scale simulations are performed of flow through porous (pyrolyzing) thermal protection system (TPS) materials using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. DSMC results for permeability are validated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and theory, for simple porous geometries under continuum flow conditions. An artificial fiber-microstructure generation code FiberGen is used to create triangulated surface geometry representative of FiberForm (R) (FiberForm) material. DSMC results for permeability of FiberForm are validated for a range of pressures (transitional flow conditions) and agree with experimental measurements. Numerical uncertainty is determined to be within 2% if sufficiently large portions of the microstructure are included in the computation. However, small variations in fiber size and angle bias can combine to give +30% uncertainty when comparing with experimental permeability data. X-ray microtomography scans of FiberForm are used to create microstructure geometry for incorporation within DSMC simulations of coupled oxygen diffusion and gas-surface chemistry in the presence of a blowing pyrolysis gas. In-depth penetration of atomic oxygen is limited to 0.2-0.4 mm for the range of Knudsen number and pyrolysis gas conditions studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a review on numerical methods for simulating multiphase and free surface flows. We focus in particular on numerical methods that seek to preserve the discontinuous nature of the solutions across the interface between phases. We provide a discussion on the Ghost-Fluid and Voronoi Interface methods, on the treatment of surface tension forces that avoid stringent time step restrictions, on adaptive grid refinement techniques for improved efficiency and on parallel computing approaches. We present the results of some simulations obtained with these treatments in two and three spatial dimensions. We also provide a discussion of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques in the context of multiphase flows and propose several future potential research thrusts for using deep learning to enhance the study and simulation of multiphase flows.

AB Biofouling severely impacts operational performance of membrane systems increasing the cost of water production. Understanding the effect of critical parameters of feed water such as biodegradable substrate concentration on the developed biofilm characteristics enables development of more effective biofouling control strategies.
   In this study, the effect of substrate concentration on the biofilm characteristics was examined using membrane fouling simulators (MFSs). A feed channel pressure drop (PD) increase of 200 mbar was used as a benchmark to study the developed biofilm. The amount and characteristics of the formed biofilm were analysed in relation to membrane performance indicators: feed channel pressure drop and permeate flux. The effect of the characteristics of the biofilm developed at three substrate concentrations on the removal efficiency of the different biofilms was evaluated applying acid/base cleaning.
   Results showed that a higher feed water substrate concentration caused a higher biomass amount, a faster PD increase, but a lower permeate flux decline. The permeate flux decline was affected by the spatial location and the physical characteristics of the biofilm rather than the total amount of biofilm. The slower growing biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration was harder to remove by NaOH/HCl cleanings than the biofilm developed at the higher substrate concentrations.
   Effective biofilm removal is essential to prevent a fast biofilm regrowth after cleaning. While substrate limitation is a generally accepted biofouling control strategy delaying biofouling, development of advanced cleaning methods to remove biofilms formed under substrate limited conditions is of paramount importance.

AB The frequent detection of artificial sweeteners (ASs) in wastewater and surface water gives rise to concerns about their removal, Acesulfame (ACE) and sucralose (SUC) are two ASs that are difficult to remove. The ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) advanced oxidation technology (AOT) is being considered as an effective process for the degradation of micropollutants in wastewater. However, the study of the degradation of ASs in real wastewater by the UV/PS is minimal. This study investigated the kinetics and modeling of ACE and SUC degradation in wastewater by the UV/PS process. Both ACE and SUC could be degraded effectively using this process. The degradation of ACE was mainly attributed to UV photolysis (51%), HO center dot (26%) and SO4 center dot- (16%), while that of SUC was mainly attributed to HO center dot (68%) and SO4 center dot- (27%). The second-order rate constants of ASs with SO4 center dot- were significantly lower than that with HO center dot. Three major transformation products (TPs) of ACE and four major TPs of SUC were identified. Additionally, the effects and mechanisms of the water matrices, such as HCO3-, Cl-, NO3- and natural organic matter (NOM), on ASs degradation were investigated through response surface methodology (RSM). NOM and Cl- significantly inhibited the degradation of ACE in the UV/PS system, whereas NOM and HCO3- played a main inhibition role on the degradation of SUC. A water matrices parameter model for predicting ASs degradation in real wastewater was established by RSM for the first time, and the removal of ACE and SUC was well predicted by the model.

AB Intensive membrane cleaning can be used with ceramic membranes since they are physically/chemically robust. It might therefore be possible for membrane bioreactors (MBRs) to be operated under the condition of a high membrane flux when ceramic membranes are used with such intensive membrane cleaning. In this study, bench-scale MBRs equipped with flat-sheet ceramic membranes were operated for long periods. Circulation of granular materials (cylindrical polyurethane) in the tank and frequent chemically enhanced backwash (CEB) were used as intensive physical cleaning and chemical cleaning in this study, respectively. Experiments were carried out with synthetic wastewater. The use of granular materials, which can cause significant damage to polymeric membranes (Kurita et al., 2015), was effective for controlling the formation of cake (deposition of microbial flocs) on the surface of the ceramic membranes. When both mechanical cleaning using the granular materials and CEB with 1000 ppm of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) were applied, contrary to an expectation, evolution of reversible fouling (formation of a transparent gel layer on the membrane surface) became uncontrollable, whereas irreversible fouling was effectively controlled. The use of NaClO induced release of organic macromolecules via biomass decay, leading to the evolution of reversible fouling. When the intensity of CEB with NaClO was adequately lowered, with the aid of the mechanical cleaning using the granules, the bench-scale MBR could be operated stably under an elevated membrane flux for a long period (>70 days). It was postulated that the adjustment of CEB intensity preferably altered properties of organic macromolecules released from biomass: the structure of the gel layer was porous when the CEB intensity was lowered. When CEB is used in MBRs, it is thus important to balance cleaning efficiency and its harmful effect on biomass. When adequate CEB is used with intensive mechanical cleaning, MBRs with ceramic membranes can be operated under high flux conditions. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A household slow sand filter (HSSF) is a widely used water treatment technology recognized as one of the most effective and sustainable in reducing waterborne diseases. However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning its behaviour in the presence of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. In this context, the study aimed to evaluate HSSF ability to remove Microcystis aeruginosa cells (stain BB005) and microcystin-LR from water, among other parameters, when operated under continuous (C-HSSF) and intermittent (I-HSSF) flows. C-HSSF was operated at a constant filtration rate (1.22 m(3) m(-2) day(-1)), while I-HSSF was operated at a variable filtration rate (starting at 2.95 m(3) m(-2) day(-1) and finishing at zero). Each filter produced 60 L day(-1). The influence of the pause period was also tested in the I-HSSF. The water from the study was prepared by inoculating M. aeruginosa culture in water from a well to a final cell density of +/- 1 x 10(5) cells mL(-1). M. aeruginosa removal rates were 2.39 +/- 0.34 log and 2.01 +/- 0.43 log by C-HSSF and I-HSSF, respectively. Microcystin-LR concentration in studied water was 5.55 mu g L-1, and both filters produced filtered water with microcystin concentrations below 1.0 mu g L-1, the maximum value recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), for most of the samples. Turbidity and apparent colour were also within WHO guidelines. Filters operating with different flow regimes and distinct residence times did not statistically influence treatment efficiencies. Both filters showed promising results in the M. aeruginosa and microcystin-LR removals from water; nevertheless, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms involved in the reduction of both cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin through household slow sand filtration.

AB If photocatalytic water purification technologies will find practical applications, the impact of total dissolved solids in the source water on the activity of the photocatalyst must be evaluated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SiO32- in water on a TiO2 ceramic photocatalyst; specifically, we determined the effects of SiO32- on the rate of photocatalytic degradation of formic acid (as a model contaminant) and on the rate of photocatalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli in an aqueous solution. Both the rate of formic acid degradation and the sterilization rate decreased with increasing SiO32- concentration. On the other hand, at a given SiO32- concentration, the activity of the photocatalyst did not decrease over the course of 120 h, and the surface structure of the photocatalyst did not change (i.e., no precipitate formed on the surface). The decreases in photocatalytic activity due to the presence of SiO32- could be recovered by flushing the experimental apparatus with distilled water. These results show that the reason for the lower photocatalytic activity in the presence of SiO32- than in its absence was due to adsorption of SiO32-- onto the surface of the TiO2 photocatalyst and that SiO32- adsorption was an equilibrium process in water.

AB Due to high phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) content, human urine has often proven to suitable raw material for fertiliser production. However, most of the urine diverting toilets or male urinals dilute the urine 2 to 10 times. This decreases the efficiency in the precipitation of P and stripping of N. In this work, a commercial fertiliser blend was used as forward osmosis (FO) draw solution (DS) to concentrate real diluted urine. During the concentration, the urea in the urine is recovered as it diffuses to the fertiliser. Additionally, the combination of concentrate PO43-, reverse Mg2+-flux from the DS and the Mg2+ presents in the flushing water, was able to recover the PO43- as struvite. With 50% concentrated urine, 93% P recovery was achieved without the addition of an external Mg2+ Concurrently, 50% of the N was recovered in the diluted fertiliser DS. An economic analysis was performed to understand the feasibility of this process. It was found that the revenue from the produced fertilisers could potentially offset the operational and capital costs of the system. Additionally, if the reduction in the downstream nutrients load is accounted for, the total revenue of the process would be over 5.3 times of the associated costs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mesophilic batch anaerobic digesters fed by different substrates were set up to identify the role of substrate rheology in anaerobic digestion performance while operating below the toxic level. Five substrates of different rheological behaviour but at the same amount of organic matters were prepared by addition of different amount of an inert material (0, 0.03, 0.07, 0.11, and 0.20 g) per g of waste activated sludge (WAS). To gain a comprehensive insight, the interactive relationship between substrate rheology, physico-chemical properties and biogas production as well as digestate dewaterability was investigated. The results proved that better access of microorganisms to organic matters improved the digester performance and led to 19.29% and 12.5% increase in biogas yield and VS removal efficiency, respectively. Moreover, the statistical analysis showed that consistency index and loss modulus of sludge could be employed as promising indications for biogas yield while yield stress could predict dewaterability of digestate as far as the other physico-chemical properties remained unchanged. During digestion measurement of consistency index and loss modulus of digestate could be performed as a reliable tool to monitor biogas production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flushing toilet with seawater is an effective method for preserving freshwater resources, but it introduces iodide and bromide ions into domestic wastewater. During chlorine disinfection, iodide and bromide ions in the saline wastewater effluent lead to the formation of iodinated and brominated aromatic disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Examples of aromatic DBPs include iodophenolic, bromophenolic and chlorophenolic compounds, which generally display substantially higher toxicity than haloaliphatic DBPs. This paper presented for the first time the rates of phototransformation of 21 newly identified halophenolic DBPs in seawater, the receiving waterbody of the wastewater effluent. The phototransformation rate constants (k) were in the range from 7.75 x 10(-4) to 4.62 x 10(-1) h(-1), which gave half-lives of 1.5-895 h. A quantitative structure activity relationship was established for the phototransformation of halophenolic DBPs as log k = -0.0100 x Delta G(f)(0) + 5.7528 x log MW + 0.3686 x pKa - 19.1607, where Delta G(f)(0) is standard Gibbs formation energy, MW is molecular weight, and pKa is dissociation constant. This model well predicted the k values of halophenolic DBPs. Among the tested DBPs, 2,4,6-triiodophenol and 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol were found to exhibit relatively high risks on marine organisms, based on toxicity indices and half-lives. In seawater, the two DBPs underwent photonucleophilic substitutions by bromide, chloride and hydroxide ions, resulting in the conversion to their bromophenolic and chlorophenolic counterparts (which are less toxic than the parent iodophenolic DBPs) and to their hydroxyphenolic counterparts (iodo(hydro)quinones, which are more toxic than the parent iodophenolic DBPs). The formed iodo(hydro)quinones further transformed to hydroxyl-iodo(hydro)quinones, which have lower toxicity than the parent compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The solar/chlorine process produces multiple reactive species by solar photolysis of chlorine, which can be used as an energy-efficient technology for water treatment. This study investigated the effects of pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) on the degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and on the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in the solar/chlorine system. The degradation of 24 structurally diverse PPCPs was enhanced appreciably in the solar/chlorine system compared to solar irradiation and dark chlorination. The reactive species in the solar/chlorine system were identified to be hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot), reactive chlorine species (RCS, i.e., Cl-center dot and ClO center dot) and ozone. With increasing pH from 6 to 8, the steady-state concentrations of HO center dot and Cl-center dot decreased from 1.23 x 10(-14) M to 4.79 x 10(-15) M and from 9.80 x 10(-16) M to 4.31 x 10(-16) M, respectively, whereas that of ClO center dot increased from 5.30 x 10(-14) M to 2.68 x 10(-13) M and the exposure of ozone increased from 0.44 mu M min to 1.01 mu M min in 90 min. Accordingly, the removal efficiencies of 6 PPCPs decreased and 11 PPCPs increased. The decreased removal of PPCPs with increasing pH was due to the decrease in HO center dot and Cl-center dot, while the increased removal was attributed to the increased ClO center dot and ozone. The presence of DO enhanced the degradation of most PPCPs, indicating the role of ozone on the degradation. The formation of total organic chlorine (TOCl) and known DBPs was enhanced by 60.7% and 159.4%, respectively, in the solar/chlorine system compared to chlorination in a simulated drinking water containing 2.5 mg L-1 natural organic matter (NOM). As the pH rose from 6 to 8, TOCl formation decreased by 16.2%, while that of known DBPs increased by 58.6% in solar/chlorine. The absence of DO slightly suppressed the formation of TOCl and known DBPs. This study illustrated the significant role of RCS in the solar/chlorine system, which enhanced the degradation of micropollutants but increased the formation of chlorinated DBPs.

AB Transformation of industrial chemicals might be a significant source of hitherto unknown persistent and mobile organic contaminants (PMOC, PM chemicals) present in the aquatic environment. Herein we depicted a three-step strategy consisting of (I) the prioritization of potential PMOC precursors among REACH-registered chemicals, (II) their lab scale transformation through hydrolysis, photolysis, MnO2 oxidation, and biotransformation and subsequent structural elucidation of derived transformation products, and finally (III) the assessment of their environmental relevance. The proposed procedure was utilized to investigate eleven chemicals, for nine of which a concentration reduction was observed. For six of these chemicals transformation products were at least tentatively identified and partially confirmed with a commercially available reference standard. Retrospective assessment of high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry data as well as a target screening method for the identified TPs and some of the prioritized REACH chemicals revealed the widespread presence of the following chemicals in the environment: 2-pyrrolidone (hydrolysis product of vinylpyrrolidone), TP 216 (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-acetic acid, biotransformation product of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-ethanol), and 1,3-diphenylguanidine (prioritized chemical with experimental evidence of environmental stability). 2-Pyrrolidone was detected in 23/25 investigated surface water samples and present in concentrations of up to 400 ng/L. TP 216 was detected in 20/25 surface water samples and an additional sampling of a waste water treatment plant and the receiving surface water confirmed that TP 216 is formed in waste water treatment plants. The vulcanisation agent 1,3-diphenylguanidine was present in all investigated samples. A leaching experiment with a tire suggested that tires and thus tire wear particles are a potential source of 1,3-diphenylguanidine. With these data the depicted approach was proven successful and suitable for true unknowns like TP 216, and thus an alternative to non-target screenings or suspect-screenings with predicted TPs to identify environmentally relevant transformation products.

AB Hydrological droughts have considerable negative impacts on water quantity and quality, and understanding their regional characteristics is of crucial importance. This study presents a multi-stage framework to detect and characterize hydrological droughts considering both streamflow and water quality changes. Hydrological droughts are categorized into three stages of growth, persistence, retreat, and water quality variables (i.e., water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and turbidity) are utilized to further investigate drought recovery. The framework is applied to 400 streamflow gauges across the Contiguous United States (CONUS) over the study period of 1950-2016. The method is illustrated for the 2012 US drought, which affected most of the nation. Results reveal the duration, frequency, and severity of historical droughts in various regions as well as their spatial consistencies and heterogeneities. Furthermore, duration of each stage of drought (i.e., growth, persistence, and retreat) is also assessed and the spatial patterns are diagnosed across the CONUS. Considering the water quality variables, increased water temperature (4 degrees C on average) and reduced dissolved oxygen concentration (2.5 mg/L on average) were observed during drought episodes, both of which impose severe consequences on ecology of natural habitats. On the contrary, turbidity was found to decrease during droughts, and indicate a sudden increase when drought terminates, due to increase in runoff. Varied drought recovery durations are perceived for different water quality variables, and in general, it takes about two more months for water quality variables to recover from a drought, following the hydrological drought termination.

AB At contaminated sites, indoor inhalation of volatile organic compounds from groundwater contamination, known as vapor intrusion (VI), is an important exposure pathway to determine groundwater cleanup level. Based on empirical analysis, US EPA concluded that there is a low probability for vapors from fuel hydrocarbons dissolved in groundwater to induce indoor concentrations that exceed risk-based standards, and recommended 6 feet vertical building-source separation distance as the risk screening tool for such cases. In this study, we examine this recommendation by performing numerical modeling to investigate the detailed effects of the capillary fringe on petroleum vapor biodegradation and attenuation. First, the numerical model is validated by comparison with laboratory data and field measurements in US EPA's database. Then the verified model is used to simulate two scenarios involving the capillary fringe effect, one with a groundwater source at various depth and the other with a soil gas source located above the groundwater level. For a groundwater contaminant source, the capillary fringe plays a significant role in VI by controlling the soil moisture content and oxygen availability, thus affecting the soil gas concentration biodegradation and attenuation. Specifically, the capillary fringe effect can significantly decrease the indoor air concentration by decreasing upward diffusion rates of hydrocarbon, increasing the thickness of the aerobic zone, and enhancing aerobic biodegradation. As a result, it is highly unlikely for sources located at groundwater level to induce unacceptable vapor intrusion risks, supporting US EPA's recommendation. Moreover, the simulations suggest that the vertical smear zone of residual light non-aqueous liquid contamination, induced by temporal fluctuations of groundwater level, may lead to a potential threat to indoor air quality for a short vertical source-building separation distance, and thus requires more attention. The sensitivity test of the numerical model also indicates that it is the vertical separation distance between building foundation and the top of the smear zone instead of the smear zone thickness that should be given more attention during the investigation.

AB Functional identification and elimination of activity-decayed sludge are helpful for improving the performance of biological treatment process. However, cell decay-associated changes in biological functions have not been explored for gravity-separated sludge. In this work, sludge flocs from the aerobic basin of a wastewater treatment plant treating high-concentration organic coking wastewater was fractionated according to settling velocity, i.e. sludge F (fast settling), sludge M (moderate settling) and sludge S (slow settling). Sludge volume index (SVI), mean floc size, dehydrogenase activity, specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) content and aggregation interaction were investigated in the fractionated sludges. Apoptosis-like decayed cell distribution (ALDCD), a novel property of sludge, was proposed to describe sludge decay based on cell membrane variation. ALDCD of sludge F was 6.64% and 13.5% lower than sludge M and S, respectively. Microbial community and functional prediction revealed that sludge F exhibited the highest microbial potential for organic removal and sludge M had the highest potential for nitrogen metabolism while sludge S had the lowest potential for both. Our analysis suggests that the treatment efficiency might be enhanced by retaining compact sludge flocs while eliminating dispersive sludge flocs. This study also facilitates the identification and elimination of functional microbial groups from decayed sludge in wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Clean water is one of the main resources for key activities such as agriculture, power generation, and public and industrial supplies. However, once wastewater generated by these activities is released into the environment, it may represent a potential risk to ecosystems and even human health depending on the presence of certain types and levels of contaminants. This study is focused on personal care products (PCPs), a class of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) which includes commonly used cosmetic and personal hygiene products (e.g., fragrances, UV filters, antimicrobials, surfactants, among others), and their comparison with legacy contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). We have monitored the concentrations of up to 66 target compounds in influent and effluent wastewater, sludge, and compost samples from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) at Jerez de la Frontera (SW Spain) over a 1-year period. Almost half of the target compounds (44%) were frequently detected in influent wastewater samples, with prevalence of synthetic fragrances and higher abundance of UV filters during warmer periods. Due to their relatively poor removal efficiencies (<70%), 30 target compounds were always detected in the final effluent. The highest levels here were observed for an UV filter (octocrylene) and three synthetic fragrances (traseolide, OTNE, and galaxolide), showing maximum concentrations of 4-7 mu g L-1 and 12-95 mu g g(-1) in the dissolved and particulate fractions, respectively. Concentrations of these compounds increased in sludge, being up to 365 mu g g(-1) for some fragrances and showing negligible decrease after anaerobic digestion. Windrow composting of this sludge, however, resulted in an efficient removal (up to 100%) for most analytes. On the other hand, levels between <1 and 651 ng g(-1) were measured in soils columns (0-150 cm) at the WWTP gardens irrigated with effluent wastewater. The occurrence of PCPs in these soils seemed to be heavily influenced by temperature, as maximum concentrations were measured in colder months, indicating a higher rate of microbial activity degradation and/or volatilization during warmer months.

AB The hyporheic zone (HZ), located at the interface of surface and groundwater, is a natural bioreactor for attenuation of chemical contaminants. Engineered HZs can be incorporated into stream restoration projects to enhance hyporheic exchange, with flowpaths optimized to promote biological habitat, water quantity, and water quality improvements. Designing HZs for in-stream treatment of stormwater, a significant source of flow and contaminant loads to urban creeks, requires assessment of both the hydrology and biogeochemical capacity for water quality improvement. Here, we applied tracer tests and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to characterize an engineered hyporheic zone unit process, called a hyporheic design element (HDE), in the Thornton Creek Watershed in Seattle, WA. Dye, NaCl, and bromide were used to hydrologically link downwelling and upwelling zones and estimate the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of hyporheic flowpaths. We then compared water quality improvements across hydrologically-linked surface and hyporheic flowpaths (3-5 m length; similar to 30 min to >3 h) during baseflow and stormflow conditions. We evaluated fate outcomes for 83 identified contaminants during stormflow, including those correlated with an urban runoff mortality syndrome in coho salmon. Non-target HRMS analysis was used to assess holistic water quality improvements and evaluate attenuation mechanisms. The data indicated substantial water quality improvement in hyporheic flowpaths relative to surface flow and improved contaminant removal with longer hyporheic HRT (for similar to 1900 non-target compounds detected during stormflow, <17% were attenuated >50% via surface flow vs. 59% and 78% via short and long hyporheic residence times, respectively), and strong contributions of hydrophobic sorption towards observed contaminant attenuation.

AB The UV/peracetic acid (UV/PAA) process as a novel advanced oxidation process has been reported to produce carbon-centered radicals (R-C center dot) for Naproxen (NAP) degradation, which is a representative of naphthyl structure substances. Real water matrices, such as carbonate and bicarbonate ions (CO32-/HCO3-), humic acid (HA), and chloride ion (Cl-), may react with these reactive radicals and change their contributions to NAP degradation. The results showed that R-C center dot. contributed 60.8% and center dot OH contributed 39.2% to NAP degradation in pure water by a competition method. CO32-/HCO3- (0-20 mM) showed minimal effect on NAP degradation in the UV/PAA process, meanwhile, it has observable inhibition effect on NAP degradation in the UV/H2O2 process (mainly of center dot OH) and minimal effect in the UV/PAA process with tert-butanol (TBA) (mainly of R-C center dot). Results suggested that CO32-/HCO3- could react with center dot OH yielding CO3 center dot- with low reactivity to NAP, CO3 center dot- could further react with PAA to produce R-C center dot. This speculation was confirmed by the increased contribution of R-C center dot to NAP degradation with the increase of CO32-/HCO3- concentration through the competition method. HA (0-5 mg/L) had a higher scavenging capacity for R-C center dot than center dot OH because HA with naphthyl structure was likely to be attacked by R-C center dot.Cl- (0-200 mM) had little effect on NAP degradation in the UV/PAA and UV/H2O2 processes, while exerted an observable inhibition on NAP degradation in the UV/PAA process with TBA. This finding suggested that Cl- could react with R-C center dot to produce Cl center dot, which could further convert into HOCl center dot(-), and then excess center dot OH was formed. The new knowledge on the conversion of reactive radicals obtained in this study provides an important basis for facilitating further research on the UV/PAA advanced oxidation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are a group of diverse anaerobic microorganisms omnipresent in natural habitats and engineered environments that use sulfur compounds as the electron acceptor for energy metabolism. Dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR)-based techniques mediated by SRB have been utilized in many sulfate-containing wastewater treatment systems worldwide, particularly for acid mine drainage, groundwater, sewage and industrial wastewater remediation. However, DSR processes are often operated suboptimally and disturbances are common in practical application. To improve the efficiency and robustness of SRB-based processes, it is necessary to study SRB metabolism and operational conditions. In this review, the mechanisms of DSR processes are reviewed and discussed focusing on intracellular and extracellular electron transfer with different electron donors (hydrogen, organics, methane and electrodes). Based on the understanding of the metabolism of SRB, responses of SRB to environmental stress (pH-, temperature-, and salinity-related stress) are summarized at the species and community levels. Application in these-stressed conditions is discussed and future research is proposed. The feasibility of recovering energy and resources such as biohydrogen, hydrocarbons, poly-hydroxyalkanoates, magnetite and metal sulfides through the use of SRB were investigated but some long-standing questions remain unanswered. Linking the existing scientific understanding and observations to practical application is the challenge as always for promotion of SRB-based techniques. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although oxidation of As(III) to As(V) is deemed necessary to promote arsenic removal, the oxidation process usually involves toxic byproducts, well-defined conditions, energy input or sludge generation. Moreover, extra operations are required to remove the resulting As(V). A heterogeneous catalytic process of CuFe2O4 with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) is established for As(III) oxidation and adsorption. The PMS can be activated by CuFe2O4 to generate radical species for As(III) oxidation. The CuFe2O4/PMS has a stronger affinity for arsenic than CuFe2O4 alone. Oxidation and adsorption promote each other. As a result, the heterogeneous catalytic process is more efficient for As(III) removal than a preoxidation of As(III) followed by adsorption. The adsorption capacity for As on CuFe2O4/PMS reached up to 63.9 mg/g, which is much higher than that of As(III) (36.9 mg/g) or As(V) (45.4 mg/g) on CuFe2O4 alone. The process can work effectively over a wide range of pH values (3-9) and temperatures (10-40 degrees C). Coexisting ions such as sulfate, carbonate, silicate and humic acid have an insignificant effect on As(III) removal. The As(III) (1415 mu g/L) can be completely oxidized to As(V) and rapidly removed to below 10 mu g/L (less than 15 min) using CuFe2O4(0.2 g/L)/PMS(100 mu M). Moreover, the As(III) (50 mu g/L) can be completely oxidized and removed within 1 min. The proposed process is easily applicable for the remediation of As(III)contaminated water under ambient conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many arsenic-bearing freshwaters are facing with eutrophication and consequent algae-induced anoxia/ hypoxia events. However, arsenic cycling in eutrophic waters and its impact on public health are poorly understood. Laboratory simulation experiments are performed in this study to investigate the effect of algal blooms on the cycling of arsenic in a sediment-water-air system. We found that the anoxia induced by the degradation of algal biomass promoted an acute arsenic (mostly As(III)) release within two days from sediment to both the water and atmosphere, and the release effluxes were proportional to the algae dosage. The reduction and methylation of arsenic were enhanced at the sediment-water interface, owing to the significant increase in arsenate reductase genes (arrA and arsC), and arsenite methyltransferase genes (arsM) caused by increased anoxia. The analysis of synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicated that the concomitantly released natural organic matter (NOM) and sulfur (S) at the sediment water interface reduced the As(III) release to a certain extent in the later reducing period of incubation, by forming As2S3 (43-51%) and As(III)-Fe-NOM (28-35%). Our results highlight the needs for the in-situ assessment of volatile arsenic in eutrophic freshwaters with its risk to human and animal health. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coil (E.coii) and Enterococcus, have been widely used to indicate the presence of pathogens. However, the suitability of fecal indicator bacteria to represent health risks is still being challenged, particularly in tropical aquatic environments. The objective of this study is to understand the occurrence and prevalence of indicators and pathogens in areas with contrasting land use, as well as to identify the major correlations between indicators, pathogens and environmental parameters. The spatial and temporal variation of indicators and pathogens was studied to examine the distribution patterns for areas with different land use, and the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations. A total of 234 water samples were sampled for two years from reservoirs and their tributaries, and tested for fecal indicator bacteria, coliphages, human specific markers, pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The prevalence of indicators and pathogens in reservoirs were generally low, while relatively high concentrations were observed in tributaries to varying degrees. Of the enteric viruses, norovirus GII was among the most prevalent and had the highest concentration. Although strong correlations were found between indicators, only relatively weak correlations were found between indicators and pathogens. The results in this study showed that none of the bacteria/phage indicators were universal predictors for pathogens. Inclusion of the alternative indicators, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Bacteroides and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) to monitoring programs could help to determine whether the fecal source was human. The microbial distribution patterns allow the classification of sampling sites to different clusters and thus, help to identify sites which have poor water quality. This approach will be useful for water quality management to pinpoint factors that influence water quality and help to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Metabolic division of labor is a key ecological strategy in bacteria to allow concurrent execution of multiple tasks through functional differentiation and metabolite exchange. While it is prevalent in nature, a lot of novel interactions remain to be further explored for improved wastewater biological treatment. Here, we present a combined experimental and modeling study on the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and thiocyanate from wastewater by using a syntrophic microbial community. The syntrophic division of labor was achieved by coupling autotrophic denitrification (AD) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (AN) through both cooperative and competitive interactions. We demonstrated that the syntrophic community can achieve almost complete removal of all pollutants under certain initial conditions. We then perturbed the initial condition by varying the concentration ratio between ammonium to thiocyanate as well as the biomass ratio between AD and AN. Our observations show that adding ammonium negatively impacts the thiocyanate removal efficiency and adding anammox bacteria have opposite effects on the removal efficiency of thiocyanate and ammonium. Using a mathematical model, we simultaneously varied these two initial conditions and identified the parameter regime where our syntrophic ecosystem can be most efficient in removing total nitrogen. By highlighting the utility of syntrophic pair of functional bacteria in removing pollutants, our study will facilitate the rational design of more complex microbial consortia for the removal of toxic and hazardous compounds from industrial wastewater.

AB Substantial consumption and widespread contamination of the available freshwater resources necessitate a continuing search for sustainable, cost-effective and energy-efficient technologies for reclaiming this valuable life-sustaining liquid. With these key advantages, capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technology for the facile removal of ions or other charged species from aqueous solutions via capacitive effects or Faradaic interactions, and is currently being actively explored for water treatment with particular applications in water desalination and wastewater remediation. Over the past decade, the CDI research field has progressed enormously with a constant spring-up of various cell architectures assembled with either capacitive electrodes or battery electrodes, specifically including flow by CDI, membrane CDI, flow-through CDI, inverted CDI, flow-electrode CDI, hybrid CDI, desalination battery and cation intercalation desalination. This article presents a timely and comprehensive review on the recent advances of various CDI cell architectures, particularly the flow-by CDI and membrane CDI with their key research activities subdivided into materials, application, operational mode, cell design, Faradaic reactions and theoretical models. Moreover, we discuss the challenges remaining in the understanding and perfection of various CDI cell architectures and put forward the prospects and directions for CDI future development.

AB Water pollution risks to human health and the environment are emerging as serious concerns in the European Union and worldwide. With the aim to achieve good ecological and chemical status of all European water bodies, the "European Water Framework Directive" (WFD) was enacted. With the framework, bioanalytical techniques have been recognized as an important aspect. However, there are limitations to the application of bioassays directly for water quality assessment. Such approaches often fail to identify pollutants of concern, since the defined priority and monitored pollutants often fail to explain the observed toxicity. In this study, we integrated an effect-based risk assessment with a zebrafish-based investigation strategy to evaluate water sample extracts and fractions collected from the Danube. Four tiered bioassays were implemented, namely RNA-level gene expression assay, protein-level ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay, cell-level micronucleus assay and organism-level fish embryo test (FET). The results show that teratogenicity and lethality during embryonic development might be induced by molecular or cellular damages mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated activity, estrogenic activity and genotoxic activity. With the combination of high-throughput fractionation, this effect-based strategy elucidated the major responsible mixtures of each specific toxic response. In particularly, the most toxic mixture in faction F4, covering a log Kow range from 2.83 to 3.42, was composed by 12 chemicals, which were then evaluated as a designed mixture. Our study applied tiered bioassays with zebrafish to avoid interspecies differences and highlights effect-based approaches to address toxic mixtures in water samples. This strategy can be applied for large throughput screenings to support the main toxic compounds identification in water quality assessment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB River biofilms play fundamental roles in shaping the architecture of aquatic systems. Sorption to biofilms was thought to be a crucial mechanism controlling the fate and transport of trace emerging contaminants. This study focused on the role of in situ colonized river biofilms in the early fate of phthalate esters (PAEs) and bisphenols (BPs) at trace concentrations in a representative urban river. PAEs and BPs were readily sorbed to biofilms with uptakes of 38.2-162.5 mu g/g for PAEs and 1787.7-4425.6 mu g/g for BPs, respectively. The total mass and characteristics of the colonized biofilms varied in response to seasons and water qualities. The biofllm colonized in the downstream of a wastewater treatment plant exhibited the highest sorption capacity among the tested sites, possibly attributed to the higher organic contents of biofilms owing to the elevated availability of nutrients. Correlation analysis indicates that certain water qualities, e.g., TN and NH3-N, and biofllm properties, e.g., organic and polysaccharide fractions could be selected to predict the sorption capacities of river biofilms. Hydrophobic partitioning into organic matter appears to be the dominant sorption mechanism and biofllm polysaccharides were probably responsible for the adhesion of tested compounds. The contaminant partitioning into biofilm and sediment at mass/volume ratios typical for small rivers suggests that the biofilm could serve as an important sorbing matrix for the trace organic contaminants as compared to the sediments. Our work yields new insights into the early uptake and accumulation of trace plasticizers by natural biofilms, which is of significance in understanding the subsequent transport of trace organic contaminants in fluvial systems.

AB Suspended growth, mixed community phototrophic wastewater treatment systems (including high-rate algal ponds and photobioreactors) have the potential to achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus recovery with effluent nutrient concentrations below the current limit-of-technology. In order to achieve reliable and predictive performance, it is necessary to establish a thorough understanding of how design and operational decisions influence the complex community structure governing nutrient recovery in these systems. Solids residence time (SRT), a critical operational parameter governing growth rate, was leveraged as a selective pressure to shape microbial community structure in laboratory-scale photobioreactors fed secondary effluent from a local wastewater treatment plant. In order to decouple the effects of SRT and hydraulic retention time (HRT), nutrient loading was fixed across all experimental conditions and the effect of changing SRT on microbial community structure, diversity, and stability, as well as its impact on nutrient recovery, was characterized. Reactors were operated at distinct SRTs (5,10, and 15 days) with diurnal lighting over long-term operation (>6 SRTs), and in-depth examination of the eukaryotic and bacterial community structure was performed using amplicon-based sequencing of the 18S and 16S rRNA genes, respectively. In order to better represent the microalgal community structure, this study leveraged improved 18S rRNA gene primers that have been shown to provide a more accurate representation of the wastewater process-relevant algal community members. Long-term operation resulted in distinct eukaryotic communities across SRTs, independent of the relative abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in the inoculum. The longest SRT (15 days, SRT 15) resulted in a more stable algal community along with stable bacterial nitrification, while the shortest SRT (5 days, SRT 5) resulted in a less stable, more dynamic community. Although SRT was not strongly associated with overall bacterial diversity, the eukaryotic community of SRT 15 was significantly less diverse and less even than SRT 5, with a few dominant OTUs making up a majority of the eukaryotic community structure in the former. Overall, although longer SRTs promote stable bacterial nitrification, short SRTs promote higher eukaryotic diversity, increased functional stability, and better total N removal via biomass assimilation. These results indicate that SRT may be a key factor in not only controlling microalgal community membership, but community diversity and functional stability as well. Ultimately, the efficacy and reliability of Nfq removal may be in tension with TN removal in mixed phototrophic systems given that lower SRTs may achieve better total N removal (via biomass assimilation) through increased eukaryotic diversity, biomass productivity, and functional stability.

AB This study aims to provide a method for developing artificial neural networks in estuaries as emulators of process-based models to analyse bathing water quality and its variability over time and space. The methodology forecasts the concentration of faecal indicator organisms, integrating the accuracy and reliability of field measurements, the spatial and temporal resolution of process-based modelling, and the decrease in computational costs by artificial neural networks whilst preserving the accuracy of results. Thus, the overall approach integrates a coupled hydrodynamic-bacteriological model previously calibrated with field data at the bathing sites into a low-order emulator by using artificial neural networks, which are trained by the process-based model outputs. The application of the method to the Eo Estuary, located on the northwestern coast of Spain, demonstrated that artificial neural networks are viable surrogates of highly nonlinear process-based models and highly variable forcings. The results showed that the process-based model and the neural networks conveniently reproduced the measurements of Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations, indicating a slightly better fit for the process-based model (R-2 = 0.87) than for the neural networks (R-2 = 0.83). This application also highlighted that during the model setup of both predictive tools, the computational time of the process-based approach was 0.78 times lower than that of the artificial neural networks (ANNs) approach due to the additional time spent on ANN development. Conversely, the computational costs of forecasting are considerably reduced by the neural networks compared with the process-based model, with a decrease in hours of 25, 600, 3900, and 31633 times for forecasting 1 h,1 day, 1 month, and 1 bathing season, respectively. Therefore, the longer the forecasting period, the greater the reduction in computational time by artificial neural networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deterioration modelling has been a bottlenecking step towards risk-informed asset management of municipal water distribution networks. To close the gap, we proposed a two-time-scale (ITS) point process model on a pipe level for modelling and prediction of water main breaks. This paper presents the characterization, statistical parameter estimation, probabilistic features, and application of the model. Combining Poisson and renewal models into one, the proposed TTS process is characterized by a conditional intensity function of two time variables one in a pipe clock for overall pipe aging and the other in a repair clock for local renewal. As a result, different aging patterns including the complicated bathtub type behaviour can be modelled. A novel statistical method that combines data augmentation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo was developed for model estimation to deal with partially missing event histories. A case study using real-life data collected from a regional municipality in Canada was presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model. The modelling process ranging from model estimation, verification, validation, and updating to application in asset management was thoroughly demonstrated. This study also demonstrated that one must use the full distributions of the parameters to obtain an unbiased prediction of mean number of water main breaks. The proposed model was also compared with the Poisson process model in terms of break intensity, survival probability, mean cumulative number of breaks, and mean annual number of breaks. The implications of the different results to asset management were carefully discussed as well. Last, the ability of the proposed model to capture the maintenance effectiveness of pipe repair was proven. This work represents a solid advancement towards holistic assessment of the aging risk of a municipal water distribution network. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Degradation of bromate by Fe(II)-Ti(IV) layered double hydroxides

AB The photocatalytic decomposition of bromate (BrO3-), a possible human carcinogen, has attracted much attention because of its high efficiency and easier combination with ultraviolet (UV) disinfection in water treatment plants. In this study, the Fe(II)-Ti(IV) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been made through a facile hydrothermal method and used as an alternative photocatalyst for reduction of BrO3-. LDHs prepared at a Fe/Ti molar ratio of similar to 0.5 and pH 7.0, denoted as Fe-Ti-0.5 (pH 7.0), exhibited the highest BrO3- removal efficiency (removal rate constant = 0.067 +/- 0.002 min(-1)) compared to commercial TiO2 and the LDHs prepared at different pHs or different Ferri ratios. The presence of alcohols in water enhanced the photocatalytic reduction of BrO3- due to the greater abundance of electrons caused by alcohols effectively reacting with holes. The neutral pH also favors the degradation of BrO3-. However, the presence of nitrate and nitrite can inhibit the degradation process, due to their reactions with hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)) and hydrogen atom radicals (H center dot). Cyclic degradation runs and magnetic separation techniques demonstrated the superior reusability of the Fe-Ti-0.5 (pH 7.0) LDH for BrO3- removal. The removal rate of BrO3- under UV was higher than that without UV, indicating that the decomposition proceeded primarily via a photo-reductive mechanism induced by e(aq)(-) and H center dot and thus degradation pathways are proposed. Moreover, when tested in tap water, greater than 90% of BrO3- was removed after 60 min reaction in UV/Fe-Ti-0.5 (pH 7.0) LDH systems in the presence of 5 parts per thousand (v/v) methanol. This demonstrates the high potential for such systems for removing BrO3- from disinfected drinking water. This work may shed lights on the design of effective photocatalysts for the enhanced degradation of BrO3- in water plants and the influence of constituents in raw water on the treatment.

AB Efficient media designs for microbial quorum quenching (QQ) are essential to enable maximal biofouling control in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Here we introduce a novel, double-layered, biocarrier design, which has QQ bacteria in the shell layer with biostimulating agents in the core, for effective membrane biofouling control. Confining the biostimulant within dense polymer materials permits its controlled release over an extended period. The provision of the biostimulant from the core to the outer shell, where the QQ bacteria are encapsulated, facilitates their prolonged survival and active life. The core-shell structured QQ bead with the stimulant inside, which inhibits biofilm formation, shows the best fouling mitigation in laboratory testing of MBRs, while enhancing signal molecule degradation and lowering exopolymer secretion. This new, layered QQ bead, which has dual functions of bioaugmentation and biostimulation, supports a highly efficient and sustainable anti-biofouling strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A novel electrocatalytic system was developed to realize one-pot conversion of organic pollutants into liquid fuels such as methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH). The process combines the catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants with electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. We first coupled the electrocatalytic process with SO(4)(center dot-)based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) using a 3D-hexagonal Co3O4 anode. In this step, 4-NP was mineralized to CO2, and then the CO2 was converted to CH3OH and C2H5OH by electrocatalytic reduction using a flower-like CuO cathode. The experimental results show the destruction of 4-NP (60 mL, 10 mg/L) can be as high as 99%. In addition, the yields of CH3OH and C2H5OH were 98.29 mu mol/L and 40.95 mu mol/L, respectively, which represents a conversion of 41.8% of 4-NP into liquid fuels; the electron efficiency was 73.1%. In addition, we found that 3D-hexagonal arrays of Co3O4 with different morphologies can be obtained by adding different amounts of urea. We also investigated the formation mechanism of novel 3D-hexagonal Co3O4 arrays for the first time. A mechanism was proposed to explain the electrocatalytic steps involved in the conversion of 4-NP to CH3OH and C2H5OH and the synergetic effects between AOPs and electrocatalysis.

AB The frequent occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in aquatic environments is of great concern because of their teratogenicity, toxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity to plants, animals and human beings. In this study the bioelectricity generation, biodegradation, phytoextraction and substrate adsorption of phenanthrene and anthracene in a constructed wetland-microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) were investigated with an anode electrode amended with or without biochar-nZVI. During a 182-day operation period, the average removal efficiency for phenanthrene and anthracene ranged from 88.5% to 96.4%. The concentration of phenanthrene in roots, stems and laminas of T. orientalis was 14.9, 3.9 and 2.3 ng g(-1) respectively, while that of anthracene was 22.2, 3.1 and 1.3 ng g(-1), respectively. In addition, the application of nZVI was conducive to bioelectricity generation and organic compound degradation in the CW-MFC reactor. The distribution of the bacterial community indicated that the relative abundance of Bacillus, Paludibacter, Desulfovibrio and Lactococcus with a degradation capability for refractory organics was significantly increased. Especially the genus Bacillus for excreting catalase became more abundant. The results of our study indicate how to promote bioelectricity generation and biodegradation of refractory organic compounds in a CW-MFC by improving the culture conditions for bacteria.

AB Ammonia recovery from urine avoids the need for nitrogen removal through nitrification/denitrification and re-synthesis of ammonia (NH3) via the Haber-Bosch process. Previously, we coupled an alkalifying electrochemical cell to a stripping column, and achieved competitive nitrogen removal and energy efficiencies using only electricity as input, compared to other technologies such as conventional column stripping with air. Direct liquid-liquid extraction with a hydrophobic gas membrane could be an alternative to increase nitrogen recovery from urine into the absorbent while minimizing energy requirements, as well as ensuring microbial and micropollutant retention. Here we compared a column with a membrane stripping reactor, each coupled to an electrochemical cell, fed with source-separated urine and operated at 20 A m(-2). Both systems achieved similar nitrogen removal rates, 0.34 +/- 0.21 and 035 +/- 0.08 mol N L-1 d(-1), and removal efficiencies, 45.1 +/- 18.4 and 49.0 +/- 9.3%, for the column and membrane reactor, respectively. The membrane reactor improved nitrogen recovery to 0.27 +/- 0.09 mol N L-1 d(-1) (38.7 +/- 13.5%) while lowering the operational (electrochemical and pumping) energy to 6.5 kWh(e) kg N-1 recovered, compared to the column reactor, which reached 0.15 +/- 0.06 mol N L-1 d(-1) (17.2 +/- 8.1%) at 13.8 kWh(e) kg N-1.
   Increased cell concentrations of an autofluorescent E. coli MG1655 + prpsM spiked in the urine influent were observed in the absorbent of the column stripping reactor after 24 h, but not for the membrane stripping reactor. None of six selected micropollutants spiked in the urine were found in the absorbent of both technologies.
   Overall, the membrane stripping reactor is preferred as it improved nitrogen recovery with less energy input and generated an E. coli- and micropollutant-free product for potential safe reuse. Nitrogen removal rate and efficiency can be further optimized by increasing the NH3 vapor pressure gradient and/or membrane surface area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Silica scaling of reverse osmosis membranes in brackish water desalination is less understood than hardness scaling due to the complex silica behaviors at the membrane/water interface. In this study, -COOH, -SO3H, -NH2 and -OH functional groups were introduced onto polyamide membranes to create distinct surface physicochemical properties. The resulting membranes were further studied under similar scaling conditions to yield temporal flux loss data that were empirically interpreted by a logistic growth model. The scaled membranes were also characterized by complementary analytical techniques. It was found that permeate flux loss was strongly correlated to the initial silica layer formed by direct interaction between reactive silanol (Si -OH) and reciprocal groups on the membrane surface, rather than the entire scaling layer. Importantly, membrane surface properties dictated the initial silica layer formation through three possible mechanisms, i.e., electrostatic repulsion, competitive adsorption, and interfacial energy change. Of these, electrostatic repulsion was identified as the primary one. Therefore, by modifying the membrane surface properties, the three aforementioned mechanisms may be enhanced to favor the formation of a loose, disordered initial silica scaling layer. Accordingly, membrane flux loss may be mitigated. This finding provided important insights into the design heuristics of scaling resistant reverse osmosis membrane for brackish water desalination.

AB This paper aims to stimulate discussion based on the experiences derived from the QUICS project (Quantifying Uncertainty in Integrated Catchment Studies). First it briefly discusses the current state of knowledge on uncertainties in sub-models of integrated catchment models and the existing frameworks for analysing uncertainty. Furthermore, it compares the relative approaches of both building and calibrating fully integrated models or linking separate sub-models. It also discusses the implications of model linkage on overall uncertainty and how to define an acceptable level of model complexity. This discussion includes, whether we should shift our attention from uncertainties due to linkage, when using linked models, to uncertainties in model structure by necessary simplification or by using more parameters. This discussion attempts to address the question as to whether there is an increase in uncertainty by linking these models or if a compensation effect could take place and that overall uncertainty in key water quality parameters actually decreases. Finally, challenges in the application of uncertainty analysis in integrated catchment water quality modelling, as encountered in this project, are discussed and recommendations for future research areas are highlighted.

AB Partial lead service line replacement (PLSLR) results in the addition of a new galvanic connection and can increase lead concentrations at the tap. Focus has been given to minimizing lead release after PLSLR, but little information is available on the impact of lead remedial actions on copper concentrations, especially before passivation occurs. The impact of water quality (decreased chloride-to-sulfate mass ratio from 0.9 to 0.3; addition of orthoP; pH increase to 8.3) on lead and copper concentrations was investigated after stagnation (30 min-336 h) in a pipe rig comparing full lead service line (LSL), and two configurations of partial LSLs (Cu-Pb and Pb-Cu). Results show different trends for lead and copper: maximum lead concentrations were reached in 16 h while copper concentrations continued to increase over 336 h. Lead release rates were also the highest in the first 16 h of stagnation and were strongly impacted by water quality and the configuration of PLSLR (Cu-Pb vs Pb-Cu). Increasing the sampling flow rate from 5 to 15 LPM drastically increased the particulate lead release (78-fold) in Pb-Cu configurations; this effect was however not observed in 100% Pb or Cu-Pb configurations. High velocity flushing prior to 16 h stagnation decreased total Pb release by a factor of 12-fold for Cu-Pb, 1.6-fold for Pb-Cu and 2.0-fold for 100% Pb. Results support the definition of sampling protocols targeted for the detection of lead and copper sources and the proscription of flushing prior to sampling. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; PH
AB Microbially induced concrete corrosion (MICC) is a major deterioration affecting sewers worldwide. MICC is not uniform on sewer inner walls and often occurs at hot spots such as crown and tidal regions, which are critical to determine sewer service life. Especially, concrete corrosion in tidal regions is complicated due to the fluctuation of wastewater levels and the hydraulic scouring effects. The traditional methodology of corrosion monitoring also limits the study of the tidal corrosion. In this study, by using a combination of various advanced mineral analytical techniques and culture-independent 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the development of corrosion, the formation of corrosion products and the variation of microbial communities in tidal regions were investigated systematically. The physical-chemical characteristics in tidal regions varied with the distance from the wastewater surface. Above the wastewater, more severe corrosion was detected with a closer distance to wastewater, producing gypsum as the major corrosion products. The microbial succession in tidal regions occurred, with the coexistence of conventional autotrophic SOB and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria initially, and shifting to the predominant colonization of Mycobacterium when pH reached around 1. The heterotrophic bacteria, i.e. Mycobacterium and Bacillus, were likely responsible for the observed corrosion due to the potential capability in generating sulfuric acid. The applications of advanced mineral and microbial analytical techniques were demonstrated effective in improving the understanding of concrete sewer corrosion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a major component of DOM in waters, and plays a vital role in carbon cycling in inland waters. In this study, the light absorption and three-dimensional excitation emission matrix spectra (EEMs) of CDOM of 936 water samples collected in 2014-2017 from 234 lakes in five regions across China were examined to determine relationships between lake water sources (fresh versus saline) and their fluorescence/absorption characteristics. Results indicated significant differences regarding DOC concentration and a(CDOM)(254) between freshwater (6.68 mg C L-1, 19.55 m(-1)) and saline lakes (27.4 mg C L-1, 41.17 m(-1)). While humic-like (F-5) and fulvic-like (F-3) compounds contributed to CDOM fluorescence in all lake waters significantly, their contribution to total fluorescence intensity (F-T) differed between saline and freshwater lakes. Significant negative relationships were also observed between lake altitude with either F-5 (R-2 = 0.63, N = 306) or F-T (R-2 = 0.64, N = 306), suggesting that the abundance of humic-like materials in CDOM tends to decrease with increased in lakes altitude. In high altitude lakes, strong solar irradiance and UV exposure may have induced photo-oxidation reactions resulting in decreased abundance of humic-like substances and the formation of low molecular weight compounds. These findings have important implications regarding our understanding of C dynamics in lacustrine systems and the contribution of these ecosystems to the global C cycle. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Accurate source identification is critical for optimizing water pollution control strategies. Although the dual stable isotope (N-15-NO3-/O-18-NO3-) approach has been widely applied for differentiating riverine nitrogen (N) sources, the relatively short-term (<1 yr) N-15-NO3-/O-18-NO3- records typically used in previous studies often hinders rigorous assessment due to high temporal variability associated with watershed N dynamics. Estimated contributions of legacy N sources in soils and groundwater to riverine N export by modeling approaches in many previous studies also lack validation from complementary information, such as multiple stable isotopes. This study integrated three years of multiple stable isotope (N-15-NO3-/O-18-NO3- and H-2-H2O/O-18-H2O) and hydrochemistry measurements for river water, groundwater and rainfall to elucidate N dynamics and sources in the Yongan watershed (2474 km(2)) of eastern China. Nonpoint source N pollution dominated and displayed considerable seasonal and spatial variability in N forms and concentrations. Information from delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- indicated that riverine N dynamics were regulated by contributing sources, nitrification and denitrification, as well as hydrological processes. For the three examined catchments and entire watershed, slow subsurface and groundwater flows accounted for >75% of river discharge and were likely the major hydrological pathways for N delivery to the river. Riverine NO3- sources varied with dominant land use (p<0.001), with the highest contributions of groundwater (60%), wastewater (35%), and soil (50%) occurring in agricultural, residential and forest catchments, respectively. For the entire watershed, groundwater (similar to 50%) and soil N (>30%) were the dominant riverine NO3- sources, implying considerable potential for N pollution legacy effects. Results were consistent with observed nitrous oxide dynamics and N sources identified in previous modeling studies. As the first attempt to apply multiple isotope tracers for exploring and quantifying N transformation and transport pathways, this study provides an integrated approach for verifying and understanding the N pollution legacy effects observed in many watersheds worldwide. This study highlights that river N pollution control in many watersheds requires particular attention to groundwater restoration and soil N management in addition to N input control strategies.

AB Metal-free photocatalysts have attracted growing concern in recent years. In this work, a new class of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) modified porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is synthesized via a facile polymerization method. With the optimal CQDs loading, the CQDs modified g-C3N4 exhibits-15 times higher degradation kinetic towards diclofenac (DCF) than that of pure g-C3N4. The enhanced photo catalytic activity can be ascribed to the improved separation of charge carriers as well as the tuned band structure. Moreover, a photosensitation-like mechanism is proposed to elucidate the photo-generated electrons transfer and reactive radicals formation. CQDs are anchored to g-C3N4 surface via C-O bond, which provide channels for the preferential transfer of photo-excited electrons on DCF molecule to the conduction band of g-C3N4. Superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) dominates the degradation of DCF, while holes (h(+)) show a negligible contribution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation successfully predicts that the sites on DCF molecule with high Fukui index (f(0)) are preferable to be attacked by radicals. DCF degradation pathway mainly includes ring hydroxylation, ring closure and C-N bond cleavage processes. Acute toxicity estimation indicates the formation of less toxic intermediates/products compared to DCF after photocatalysis. Moreover, the hybrid photocatalysts exhibit good reusability in five consecutive cycles. This work not only proposes a deep insight into photosensitation-like mechanism in the photocatalysis system by using C3N4-based materials, but also develops new photocatalysts for potential application on removal of emerging organic pollutants from waters and wastewaters.

AB The competitive removal of Pb2+ and malachite green (MG) from water by three magnetic phosphate nanocomposites (Fe3O4/Ba-3(PO4)(2), Fe3O4/Sr-5(PO4)(3)(OH), and Fe3O4/Sr5xBa3x(PO4)(3)(OH), namely "FBP", "FSP", and "FSBP", respectively) was systematically investigated compared with Fe3O4 ("F") nanoparticle. Temperature and adsorbent dosage for competitive removal were optimized to be 20 degrees C and 0.05 g in 50 mL. The kinetic and isothermal adsorption results were fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively. In the competitive removal process, FSP showed a high affinity to Pb2+ (202.8 mg/g) while FBP possessed high selectivity for MG (175.4 mg/g), and FSBP was effective at simultaneous removal of Pb2+ and MG, with a capacity of 143.7 and 90.9 mg/g, respectively. The magnetic contents in nanocomposites allow magnetic separation of materials from the water after treatment. We proposed that the simultaneous removal mechanism by FSBP was due to ion exchange between Pb2+ and Sr2+ in the lattice and then the formation of hydrogen bonds between PO43- outside the material's surface and positively charged hydrogen in MG. This study indicates the potential of these phosphate nanocomposites to be used as effective materials for selective or simultaneous removal of Pb2+ and MG from water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fluidized bed bioreactors (FBR) are characterized by two-phase mixture of fluid and solid, in which the bed of solid particles is fluidized by means of downward or upward recirculation stream. FBRs are widely used for multiple environmental engineering solutions, such as wastewater treatment, as well as some industrial applications. FBR offers many benefits such as compact bioreactor size due to short hydraulic retention time, long biomass retention on the carrier, high conversion rates due to fully mixed conditions and consequently high mass transfer rates, no channelling of flow, dilution of influent concentrations due to recycle flow, suitability for enrichment of microbes with low Km values. The disadvantages of FBRs include bioreactor size limitations due to the height-to-diameter ratio, high-energy requirements due to high recycle ratios, and long start-up period for biofilm formation. This paper critically reviews some of the key studies on biomass enrichment via immobilisation of low growth yield microorganisms, high rates via fully mixed conditions, technical developments in FBRs and ways of overcoming toxic effects via solution recycling. This technology has many potential new uses as well as hydrodynamic characteristics, which enable high-rate environmental engineering and industrial applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a chloramine disinfection by-product, and its formation in drinking waters can increase due to the addition of cationic polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (polyDADMAC). PoIyDADMAC is a cationic polymer added as a coagulant or coagulant aid to enhance turbidity removal during sedimentation and filtration. This paper answers two central questions to understanding the nature of the NDMA precursors in polyDADMAC. First, what is the reactivity of different molecular weight (MW) fractions of polyDADMAC with chloramines? NDMA formation potential (NDMAFP) and kinetic experiments with chloramines were conducted for non-fractionated (raw) and size-excluded fractions (<3K, 3-10K, and >10K Da.) of polyDADMAC. The lower MW fraction (<3K Da.) of polyDADMAC solutions was responsible for forming 64 +/- 6% of the NDMA, despite containing only 8.7 and 9.8% of the carbon or nitrogen present in the bulk polymer. The chloramine demand kinetics of the lowest MW fraction were also >2 x faster than the higher MW fractions. Therefore, in a water treatment application the lower MW polyDADMAC likely contributes to most of the NDMA attributed to the use of polyDADMAC. The second question was: can H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) be used to characterize the molecular structures in polyDADMAC that react with chloramines? A peak for 1H NMR dimethylamine (DMA), a known low MW NDMA precursor, was found in a commercial polyDADMAC solution and decreased upon chloramination. The estimated DMA alone could not account for the observed NDMAFP, indicating the presence of other low MW precursors. Diffusion order spectroscopy (DOSY) NMR also showed multiple lower MW organics in polyDADMAC that change upon chloramination, including a 1.5x decrease in MW, suggesting chloramines cleave C-C or C-N bonds. These reactions may produce intermediates responsible for NDMA formation. Polymer manufacturers could use NMR to synthesize polyDADMAC with less DMA and other low MW compounds that produce NDMA upon chloramination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Waste activated sludge (WAS) contains many anionic functional groups which can interact with heavy metal ions through electrostatic action and complexation reactions. The transition metals adsorbed in WAS can catalyze sludge pyrolysis in anaerobic conditions and improve structural properties of organic matter. In this work, a multistage WAS utilization process for preparing the carbon-based Fenton-like catalysis materials is proposed. More specifically, WAS is firstly used as an adsorbent for heavy metals (Cu and Ni) removal, and then complexes are converted into heterogeneous Fenton-like carbon-based catalysts through oxygen-free pyrolysis. The mechanisms of interactions between extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and metals are investigated, and the physicochemical properties of sludge-based carbons (SBC) are comprehensively characterized using varies techniques. It is found that WAS is an excellent adsorbent for Cu and Ni removal, which is mainly due to the coordination and electrostatic interactions between EPS and heavy metals. Cu and Ni adsorbed in WAS significantly improved the porous structure of SBC. Both adsorption and catalytic oxidization of Cu/Ni-SBC contribute the removal of E2 in real wastewater. The E2 removal mechanism is explored by electron-spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) analysis, and it is found that both of center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH radicals are responsible for E2 degradation in Cu(II)-SBC-H2O2, while center dot O-2(-) radicals contributes to E2 degradation in Ni(II)-SBC-H2O2 system, so the former performed better than the latter in total removal of E2. Besides, Cu(II) and Cu(I) are both formed in Cu(II)-SBC during the oxidation process, while only Ni(II) is found in the Ni(II)-SBC-H2O2 process, confirming that different catalytic oxidation reactions are occurred in the Cu(II)-SBC-H2O2 and Ni(II)-SBC-H2O2 processes. This study facilitates a great strategy to the sludge multi-stage circulating utilization and a better understanding about the role of the Cu/Ni existed in SBC during the estrogens removal process.

AB MEG2 was recently found to have important functions in human cancers. However, the expression status and biological functions of MEG2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that MEG2 expression was reduced in HCC tissues and cell lines using qRT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Decreased MEG2 expression predicted unfavorable clinical features and decreased overall survival and disease-free survival of HCC patients. In vitro functional assays showed that overexpression of MEG2 inhibited the cell viability, migration and invasion of HCCLM3 cells while MEG2 knockdown promoted these biological functions of Hep3B cells. Subcutaneous injection model and tail vein injection model showed that forced expression of MEG2 in HCCLM3 decreased the growth and lung metastasis of HCCLM3 cells in nude mice. Mechanically, MEG2 inhibited the EMT and AKT phosphorylation of HCC cells. The promoting effects of MEG2 knockdown on BAT, cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of Hep3B cells was blocked by AKT phosphorylation inhibition. In all, this study demonstrates that MEG2 inhibits the growth and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting AKT pathway.

AB Aims: In previous studies, dysregulated IncRNAs in colorectal cancer were screened using RNA-sequencing by Atsushi Yamada. In these dysregulated lncRNAs, a long non coding RNA named CA3-AS1 attracted our attention due to its high conservation and fold change, which was downregulated in colorectal cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of IncRNA CA3-AS1 in colorectal cancer.
   Methods: RT-PCR was used to detect CA3-AS1, miR-93, PTEN mRNA expression. Apoptosis, proliferation, and invasion were examined by western blotting, CCK8, transwell assay to evaluate the function of RPL34-AS1.
   Results: We found that IncRNA CA3-AS1 mainly located in cytoplasm, and overexpression of lncRNA CA3-AS1 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and promotes cell apoptosis. Our results revealed that miR-93 could directly bind to CA3-AS1, and verified the oncogenic role of miR-93. Furthermore, we found that miR-93 played its role through regulating PTEN, the tumor-suppressor gene, which was inversely correlated with miR-93.
   Conclusion Based on the investigation, 1ncRNA CA3-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis, which could be blocked by overexpression of miR-93. In summary, our study demonstrated that CA3-AS1/miR-93/PTEN axis may play an important role in the regulation of colorectal cancer progression, which provides new insights for clinical treatment.

AB Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious clinical syndrome that can cause respiratory failure and threaten the life of the patients. A biomarker that can predict the syndrome can contribute to a better clinical management of the patients. In adults, genetic polymorphisms in inflammatory-response genes have been shown to be a promising biomarker. However, the pathogenesis of ALI in adult is known to be different from that in children and no previous study has investigated the association between inflammatory gene polymorphisms and pediatric ALI (PALI) risk. In this work, we examined the association between 12 polymorphisms in six inflammatory-response genes (TNF, IL6, IL10, IL18, NFKB1 and NFKBIA) and risk of PALI. A total of 1075 children with ALI and 1382 non-ALI controls were recruited. The polymorphisms were genotyped employing RFLP method. The risk association was estimated via logistic regression analysis, with P < 0.004 being statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. A statistically significant association was observed for IL10 rs1800896 (heterozygous, P < 0.0001; homozygous variant, P < 0.0001; allele, P < 0.0001) and TNF rs1800629 (heterozygous, P < 0.0001; homozygous variant, P = 0.0012; allele, P < 0.0001) polymorphisms. On the other hand, no significant association was found for IL6 rs1800795, rs1800796 and rs1800797 polymorphisms, IL10 rs3021097 polymorphism, NFKB1 rs28362491 polymorphism, NFKBIA rs2233406 and rs696 polymorphisms, IL18 rs1946518 and rs187238 polymorphisms, and TNF rs1799964 polymorphism. In conclusion, IL10 rs1800896 and TNF rs1800629 may serve as a risk biomarker for pediatric ALI among Chinese.

TI Associations between HMGB1 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility and
   clinical outcomes in Chinese Han sepsis patients
SO GENE

ID INFLAMMATION; PROGRESSION
AB Objectives: High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is an important late inflammatory mediator in the body. In recent years, studies have found that it plays an important pathogenic role in various diseases such as sepsis. However, it is unclear whether the genetic variation of the HMGB1 gene is related to the susceptibility to sepsis. This study investigated the relationship between susceptibility and outcome of the HMGB1 gene rs2249825, rs1045411, and rs1360485 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Chinese Han patients with sepsis.
   Methods: The HMGB1 gene rs2249825, rs1045411, and rs1360485 genotypes were detected by the direct sequencing method in 345 patients with sepsis and 345 healthy controls. Serum HMGB1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: The HMGB1 gene rs2249825 and rs1045411 site SNPs were associated with sepsis risk, but the rs1360485 site SNP was not associated with sepsis risk. Subjects with the HMGB1 gene rs2249825 and rs1045411 site mutations had higher serum HMGB1 levels, and patients with mutant genotype sepsis had higher APACHE II scores and lower 30-day survival rates. There were no correlations among the rs1360485 site SNP, sepsis risk, and patient 30-day survival.
   Conclusion: The HMGB1 gene rs2249825 and rs1045411 site SNPs are associated with susceptibility and outcomes of Chinese Han patients with sepsis. The rs2249825 locus C allele and the rs1045411 locus A allele are high risk factors for sepsis and severity in the Chinese Han population, and are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with sepsis.

AB The CYP21A2 gene encoding 21-hydroxylase is on chromosome 6p21.3 within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class III major histocompatibility complex and an association between congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and HLA class I and II alleles has been shown in genetically isolated populations. One-third of CAH causing alleles are 30-kb deletions due to homologous recombination events between active and pseudogenes resulting in chimeric genes. The aim of this study was to re-visit the association between the CYP21A2 variants and HLA polymorphisms in a large ethnically diverse cohort of patients with CAH who underwent comprehensive CYP21A2 genotyping, including specification of chimeric gene subtypes (CAH CH-1 through CH-9 of CYP21A1P/CYP21A2 chimeras; CAH-X CH-1 through CH-3 of TNXA/TNXB chimeras) in alleles with 30-kb deletions. The study population included 201 patients (86 males, 115 females, age 3-75 years) with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (159 classic, 42 nonclassic) and 194 parents. Based on the availability of parental genotype, we determined the haplotypes of CYP21A2 mutations and HLA types in 95 probands (190 alleles). Five prevalent haplotype associations were found: p.V281L and B*14-C*08 (P < 0.0001); p.I172N and DQB1*03 (P = 0.035); and of the chimeric genes caused by 30-kb deletions: CH-1 and A*03 (P = 0.033); CH-5 and C*06-DRB1*7 (P < 0.0001); and CAH-X CH-1 and DQB1*03 (P = 0.004). Our findings show that a number of associations between HLA alleles and haplotypes and CYP21A2 mutations, including large 30-kb deletions, exist commonly across ethnicities. These HLA associations may have clinical implications for patients with CAH and may provide insight into the genetics of this highly complex region of the human genome.

AB Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression may have role on recurrence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with positive surgical margin(s).
   Objective: The aim was to investigate the role of genetic expression changes of EGFR on recurrence rates in patients in follow up with surgically excised BCC with positive surgical margin(s).
   Methods: Thirty-four surgical margin positive BCC lesions that were closely followed up without an immediate reoperation were included in this study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed from the both healthy and tumoral tissue samples.
   Results: EGFR was expressed at a significantly higher rate in tumoral tissues compared to healthy tissues (p < 0,05). In patients with recurrence lesions, EGFR expression was 6,66 times higher compared to patients with non-recurrent. Also, there was statistically significant difference EGFR expression for infiltrative subtypes (p < 0,05).
   Conclusion: Our study focuses on the role of EGFR overexpression specifically and outcomes for recurrent and infiltrative subtyped lesions are significant for both clinic and pathogenesis of BCC. Similar studies have to be performed with high numbered patient groups.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that have been proposed to control or fine-tune complex genetic pathways by post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. It was proved that numerous miRNAs have influence on the biology of adipocytes as well as on the function of adipose tissues. This study shows that miR-10b-5p expression was decreased in mice, rats, and human under obesity. In addition, the obtained results indicated that the expression level of miR-1013-5p was increased in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes without manifesting a significant role in 3T3-L1 cells proliferation. On the other hand, the downregulation of miR-10b-5p by the inhibitor played a role in 3T3-L1 cells differentiation and adipogenesis. Our results strongly suggest that Apol6 was the target gene of miR-10b-5p. The inhibition of miR-10b-5p promoted the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and adipogenesis by upregulating the Apol6 expression. Then, the unregulated Apol6 acted as an oncogene in certain obesity-related cancers. These results indicate that miR-10b-5p may have a therapeutic significance for obesity and obesity-related cancers.

AB In order to explore the differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), the GSE84957 lncRNA expression profile was included in the present study through data mining in the National Center for Biotechnology Information/Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI/GEO). Then, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of LSCC (1646 lncRNAs and 2713 mRNAs, fold change >= 2, P <= 0.05) were identified from the GSE84957 dataset using bioinformatics analysis. Of the 10 selected differentially expressed lncRNAs, the expression of 7 IncRNAs were verified by qRT-PCR method. Then, LINC00668, a potential carcinogenic IncRNA, was screened out by narrowing down the screening criteria (fold change >= 4, P <= 0.01). Furthermore, correlation analysis demonstrated that expression levels of LINC00668 were associated with age, pathological differentiation degree, T stage, clinical stage and cervical lymph node metastasis. Moreover, a series of bioinformatics tools and in vitro experiments proved that knockdown of LINC00668 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of LSCC cells. The present study identified the lncRNAs landscape of LSCC through data mining and bioinformatics analysis, and verified oncogenic LINC00668, which may play important roles in promoting LSCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion.

AB Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) is a zinc finger protein transcription factor of the KLF family and plays an important role in various important biological process, including cell proliferation, differentiation, embryonic development, and cancer formation. In this study, the full length Klf4 cDNA sequence of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) was analyzed. Phylogenetic, gene structure, and synteny analysis revealed that PoKlf4 was conserved to that of teleost. Transcript of PoKlf4 showed that its expression was high during early embryonic development but reduced when gastrulation began, thus indicating its possible role in embryonic development. Tissue expression pattern showed that PoKlf4 was expressed higher in ovaries than in testes. ISH revealed that PoKlf4 was also expressed in spermatogonium, oocytes, and oogonia and in high levels in epithelial and lamellar epithelial cells of gills. Functional characterization of PoKlf4 gene promoter provided valuable information in understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms of PoKlf4 gene. PoKlf4 could up-regulate Nanog, a gene that prevents ES cells from differentiating and being up-regulated by PouSf3 and Stat3 genes that could maintain ES cell self-renewal. These results suggested that PoKlf4 maintains the pluripotency of ES cells. This study provides valuable information in exploring the regulatory network of PoKlf4 and lays the foundation for further research on the function of this gene.

AB Lin-28 is a conserved RNA-binding protein that is involved in a wide range of developmental processes and pathogenesis. At the molecular level, Lin-28 blocks the maturation of let-7 and regulates translation of certain mRNA targets. In Drosophila, Lin-28 is reported to play a role in oogenesis, muscle formation, and the symmetric division of adult intestinal stem cells. In this study, we characterized Drosophila Lin-28 through a detailed examination of its temporal and spatial expression. Lin-28 is specifically expressed in embryonic nervous and cardiac systems. However, loss or gain of lin-28 function does not cause any abnormality during embryonic development. Instead, the ubiquitous overexpression of Lin-28 leads to lethality from late larval stage to pupal stage, and eye-specific overexpression causes severe cell loss. The ectopic expression of human Lin28A has the same effect as Drosophila Lin-28, indicating functional conservation in Lin-28 orthologs. We also examined the effect of Lin-28 on let-7 biogenesis through the mutant and overexpression analysis. Lin-28 does not block the production of let-7 in Drosophila, which suggests the let-7 independent pathway as a molecular mechanism of Lin-28.

AB Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) have important functions in tumorigenesis, progression, recurrence and drug resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). lncARSR has been reported to play an important role in the maintenance and self-renewal of renal cancer stem cells, but its role in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains obscure. Herein, we observed high expression of lncARSR in chemoresistant hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). A remarkable increase of lncARSR expression in EpCAM or CD133-positive liver CSCs as well as in CSC-enriched hepatoma spheres. Interference lncARSR suppressed liver CSC expansion by inhibiting the dedifferentiation of hepatoma cells and decreasing the self-renewal ability of liver CSCs. Mechanistically, we found STAT3 as the downstream of lncARSR in HCC cells. The special STAT3 inhibitor S31-201 abolished the discrepancy in liver CSC proportion and the self-renewal capacity between lncARSR knockdown hepatoma cells and control cells, which further confirmed that STAT3 was required in lncARSR promoted liver CSCs expansion. More importantly, interference lncARSR HCC cells were more sensitive to sorafenib or cisplatin treatment. This maybe means that patients with low lncARSR levels benefited from cisplatin or sorafenib treatment, but patients with high lncARSR expression did not. Conclusion: lncARSR was upregulated in liver CSCs and could promote HCC cells dedifferentiation and liver CSCs expansion by targeting STAT3 signaling.

AB Background: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited heart muscle disease, which is mainly caused by desmosomal mutations. Sarcomere variants were the primary genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and were recently detected in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). Our aim is to seek potential pathogenic variants of sarcomere genes in our ACM cohort and describe their characteristics.
   Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of 14 sarcomere genes in 84 patients with ACM and set strict criteria to identify potential pathogenic variants. Clinical screening was performed on all available family members of the patients carrying sarcomere variants and specific variants were tested in screened family members by Sanger sequencing.
   Results: We identified 6 sarcomere variants in 6 (7%) patients, which were all definite ACM. Sarcomere variants were detected in NEBL, MYH7, MYH6 and TNNI3, with low prevalence in controls and predicted pathogenic in silico. Among these patients, three had previous detected PKP2 variants. Patients with sarcomere variants all experienced major arrhythmic cardiac event (MACE) with the average age of the first documented MACE being 41.2 +/- 11.0 years. Pedigrees analysis showed none of the sarcomere variants carriers among the family members were affected, indicating very low penetrance.
   Conclusions: We detected some sarcomere variants in our ACM cohort. Although those patients with sarcomere variants had severe arrhythmic burden, family co-segregation analysis didn't strongly support a primary role in the pathogenesis of ACM.

AB Background Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) is the most common form of primary glomerular disease with unclear molecular mechanisms. Currently, limited study on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CGN is available. Our study aimed to identify potential lncRNAs and genes in the normal and adriamycin-induced CGN rats, which to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of CGN pathogenesis.
   Methods: To identify LncRNAs specifically expressed in CGN, the expression of LncRNAs in glomerular tissues of rats from the adriamycin-induced group (n = 3) was compared with that in the control group (n = 3) using RNA-sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were performed between the 2 groups. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to analyze the biological functions and pathways for the differentially expressed mRNAs. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed to analyses for the genes. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was visualized.
   Results: A total of 114 significantly up-regulated and 86 down-regulated lncRNAs, 1038 up-regulated and 88 down-regulated mRNAs were identified. Additionally, 116, with the highest connectivity degree in PPI network, was noteworthy enriched in various kinds pathways. Coding-non-coding gene co-expression networks (CNC network) were drawn based on the correlation analysis between the differentially expressed LncRNAs and mRNAs. Ten LncRNAs, NONRATT000964.2, NONRATT018086.2, NONRATT023684.2, NONRATT009530.2, NONRATT006315.2, NONRATT026805.2, MSTRG.9260.1, NONRATT009155.2, MSTRG.7681.1, NONRATT009275.2, were selected to analyze the relationship between LncRNAs and CGN via the CNC network and GO analysis. Real-time PCR result confirmed that the six LncRNAs were specifically expressed in the CGN rats.
   Conclusions: The ten LncRNAs were differentially expressed and might play important roles in the development of CGN. Key genes, such as II6, Ptprc, TOP2a, Fos, Myc, etc., may be crucial biomarkers for CGN.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to explore the hemodynamic and morphological changes of the choke vessels, and to investigate the role of HIF-1 alpha in the flap adaptation to hypoxic and choke vessel transformation after multi-territory perforator flap transplantation.
   Methods: Animal model of single pedicle multi-territory perforator flap was established in the back of SD rats and the blood supply characteristics were studied by gelatin-oxide perfusion technique. HE staining and stereomicroscope were used to observe vascular changes. Afterward, the influence of hypoxia on cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Besides, the expression of HIF-1 alpha, iNOS and VEGF expression of HUVECs under hypoxia were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot.
   Results: The results revealed that all the choke vessels immediately began to expand after operation. The day after operation, some of the choke vessels continued to grow and expand, turning into the true anastomosis, while the others gradually dwindled and finally disappeared. Compared with the control group, the day after transplantation, the expression levels of both HIF-1 alpha and iNOS were significantly increased. The only different was that HIF-1 alpha was then maintained a high level, iNOS was significantly decreased aftertimes. What's more, the expression of VEGF was increased to the maximum at 3 days after operation and then decreased. In HUVECs, hypoxia increased the expression of HIF-1 alpha, iNOS and VEGF protein. Besides, it also promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis. In addition, we also found that hypoxia-induced VEGF and iNOS upregulation is mediated by HIF-1 alpha overexpression and HIF-1 alpha knockout can reverse the effects induced by hypoxia.
   Conclusions: We found that HIF-1 alpha may participate in the early vascular dilatation of transregional skin flap by inducing iNOS expression and promoting the reconstruction of choke vessels through increase VEGF expression.

AB The Nile tilapia Sox9b gene is characterized as a homolog of the mammalian Sox9 gene, which exhibits testis biased expression and is involved in testis development. However, the transcriptional regulation of the Sox9b gene is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the male sex differentiation gene doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (Dmrt1) was predominantly expressed in the Nile tilapia testis and that Dmrt1 knockdown in the Nile tilapia decreased the expression of the Sox9b gene in the testis. An in silica analysis predicted that the proximal promoter of the Nile tilapia Sox9b gene had two potential cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for the Dmrt1 transcription factor. Together, a luciferase reporter analysis and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Dmrt1 increased the transcriptional activity of the Nile tilapia Sox9b promoter via a specific CRE near the translation start site. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed that Dmrt1 could directly bind to this specific CRE for Dmrt1 in the Nile tilapia Sox9b promoter. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the male sex-differentiation factor Dmrt1 positively regulates the transcription of the Nile tilapia Sox9b gene by directly binding to a specific CRE within the Sox9b promoter.

The noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD) is a recently identified, highly conserved lncRNA that is essential for the mitotic cell division. Recent studies demonstrated the potential oncogenic function of NORAD in bladder cancer and colon cancer, however, the role and clinical value of NORAD have not been illustrated in gastric cancer. Here, we found that NORAD was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of NORAD was significantly correlated with the worse prognosis of the gastric cancer patients. Down-regulation of NORAD suppressed the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, NORAD acted as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), which sponged miR-608 and suppressed the expression of miR-608 in gastric cancer cells. Further experiments demonstrated that miR-608 targeted the forkhead box O6 (FOXO6) and negatively regulated the expression of FOXO6. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of NORAD on miR-608, overexpression of NORAD enhanced the level of FOXO6 in gastric cancer cells. Overexpression of FOXO6 attenuated the inhibitory effect of miR-608 on the gastric cancer cell growth. Collectively, our results demonstrated that NORAD promoted the growth of gastric cancer cells via modulating the miR-608/FOXO6 pathway.

AB RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key players of genome regulation. Here we report the transcriptome study of HnRNP D-Like protein, which belongs to the hnRNP family. We used RNA-seq to analyze the global transcript level and alternative splicing on hnRNPDL shRNA-treated cells and control. Sh-hnRNPDL extensively increased in the expression of genes involved in female pregnancy, cell apoptosis, cell proliferation and cell migration. HnRNPDL regulated alternative splicing of hundreds of genes enriched in transcription regulation and signaling pathways including NOD-like receptor signaling, Notch signaling, and TNF signaling. This study provides the first transcriptome-wide analysis of hnRNPDL regulation of gene expression, which adds to the understanding of critical hnRNPDL functions.

AB Purpose: The recent researches indicate that differential non-coding RNAs expression signatures could be associated with the pathogenesis of gastric cancer (GC). However, there are few studies focused on lncRNA-miRNAs co-expression profiling in GC patients. Therefore, in the present study the expression of H19 and MEG3 and their related miRNAs including miR-148a-3p, miR-181a-5p, miR-675-5p and miR-141-3p were determined in the plasma samples of GC patients and controls.
   Materials and methods: This case-control study included 62 GC patients and 40 age-sex matched controls. The non-coding RNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR. Further, using in silico analysis, we identified shared targets of studied miRNAs and performed GC-associated pathway enrichment analysis.
   Results: Our results showed that the H19 level was significantly (P = 0.008) elevated and MEG3 expression was significantly (P = 0.002) down-regulated in GC patients compared to healthy participants. Furthermore, it was revealed that the miR-675-5p level was increased, while miR-141-3p plasma levels were significantly reduced in GC patients (P < 0.05). We did not observe a significant difference for miR-148a-3p (P = 0.682) and miR-181a-5p (P = 0.098) expression between groups. In addition, the expression levels of H19, MEG3 and miR-148a-3p were associated with some clinicopathological features of patients (P < 0.05). ROC analysis revealed that a combination of H19, MEG3 and miR-675-5p levels able to discriminate controls and GC subjects with 88.87% sensitivity and 85% specificity (AUC, 0.927; 0.85-0.96 CI, P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: The results of current study demonstrated that combination of H19, MEG3 and miR-675-5p expression levels could provide a potential diagnostic panel for GC.

AB Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal disease with increasing morbidity and poor prognosis due to poor response to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Neurotensin (NTS) has long been recognized as an important factor in the central nervous system and as an endocrine agent in the peripheral circulation via NTS receptor (NTSR) mediated actions. In recent years, NTS has been implicated in the carcinogenesis of numerous cancers; however, its role in cholangiocarcinoma remains obscure. Here, we observed the expression of NTS in cholangiocarcinoma vs. non-cancerous tissues and found that up-regulation of NTS facilitated cholangiocarcinoma cell metastasis and down-regulation of NTS inhibited their migration ability. Mechanistically, NTS drove cholangiocarcinoma cell metastasis via the EGFR/AKT pathway. Both the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 or EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib stopped the discrepant metastatic capacity between NTS-depleted cholangiocarcinoma cells and control cells, further confirming that EGFR/AKT was required in NTS-promoted cholangiocarcinoma cell metastasis. More importantly, overexpression of NTS predicted poor prognosis of CCA patients. In summary, NTS could promote cholangiocarcinoma cells metastasis by amplifying EGFR/AKT signaling and may therefore be useful to predict patient prognosis.

ID SUSCEPTIBILITY
AB Purpose: This study aimed to find associations between miR-328 expression in whole blood, polymorphism at 3'UTR of the PAX6 gene (paired box homeotic gene 6) and myopia.
   Methods: We evaluated 451 individuals (142 individuals with low, 49 with moderate and 13 with high-degree myopia, and 247 healthy individuals). DNA and RNA were extracted from peripheral blood samples. Expression of miR-328 was assessed and genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PAX6 (rs662702) performed using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction System.
   Results: Moderate and high degree myopia showed significant differences between IT and CT genotypes of the PAX6 gene (p < 0.001). In the myopia group, 71.4% of the subjects had the TT genotype and 28.6% had the CT genotype; meanwhile in the control group, 97.1% had the TT genotype and 2.9% had the CT genotype. The odds ratio of having moderate and/or high degree myopia for individuals with the CT genotype was 13.6 (2.865-64.55) 95% CI versus TT genotype (p = 0.001). MiR-328 results showed that Delta Ct values differed statistically significantly between the myopia and control groups. Patients with myopia in the peripheral blood cells had a higher expression of miR-328 than controls (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Significant differences were detected between the PAX6 gene (rs662702) TT and CT genotypes in moderate and high degree myopia; the risk C allele increased the risk for myopia. The expression level of miR-328 in peripheral blood cells was higher in patients with myopia than controls. We did not find the association between expression of mir-328 in the peripheral blood cells and PAX6 gene (rs662702) polymorphism comparing myopia and control groups.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNA molecules, have emerged as important factors during intervertebral disc degeneration. This study was to determine whether miR-202-3p regulates interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) in human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Human NP cells were stimulated with IL-1 beta in vitro. MicroRNA arrays were used to determine the expression profile of 1971 human miRNAs and the miRNAs targets were identified using bioinformatics. In IL-1 beta-stimulated NP cells, 10 microRNAs were down-regulated, 2 microRNAs were up-regulated. There was a significant reduction in hsa-miR-202-3p (miR-202-3p) expression in the severe degenerative disc compared with mild degenerative disc. Down-regulation of miR-202-3p expression by IL-1 beta was correlated with up-regulation of MMP-1 expression in human NP cells. IL-1 beta-induced activation of MAP kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) decreased miR-202-3p expression and induced MMP-1 expression. MiR-202-3p suppressed IL-1 beta-induced MMP-1 production. Conversely, treatment with anti-miR-202-3p remarkably increased MMP-1 production. In addition, mutation of the miR-202-3p binding site in the 3'-UTR of MMP-1 mRNA abolished miR-202-3p-mediated repression of reporter activity. Functional analysis showed that miR-202-3p could decrease type II collagen degradation, whereas overexpression of MMP-1 by Lentiviral-shMMP-1 abolished the effect of miR-202-3p on type II collagen degradation. These results suggest that miR-202-3p is an important regulator of MMP-1 in human nucleus pulposus and may contribute to the development of intervertebral disc degeneration.

AB Plant aquaporins constitute a large family of proteins involved in facilitating the transport of water and small neutral molecules across biological membranes. In higher plants they are divided into several sub-families, depending on membrane-type localization and permeability to specific solutes. They are abundantly expressed in the majority of plant organs and tissues, and play a function in primary biological processes. Many studies revealed the significant role of aquaporins in acquiring abiotic stresses' tolerance. This review focuses on aquaporins belonging to PIPs sub-family that are permeable to water and/or carbon dioxide. Isoforms transporting water are involved in hydraulic conductance regulation in the leaves and roots, whereas those transporting carbon dioxide control stomatal and mesophyll conductance in the leaves. Changes in PIP aquaporins abundance/activity in stress conditions allow to maintain the water balance and photosynthesis adjustment. Broad analyses showed that tight control between water and carbon dioxide supplementation mediated by aquaporins influences plant productivity, especially in stress conditions. Involvement of aquaporins in adaptation strategies to dehydrative stresses in different plant species are discussed in this review.

AB Histone modifications such as methylation of key lysine residues play an important role in embryonic development in a variety of organisms such as of Pacific oysters, zebrafish and mice. The action of demethylase ("erasers") and methyltransferase ("writers") enzymes regulates precisely the methylation status of each lysine residue. However, despite fishes being very useful model organisms in medicine, evolution and ecotoxicology, most studies have focused on mammalian and plant model organisms, and mechanisms underlying regulation of histones are unknown in fish development outside of zebrafish. Here, putative histone lysine demethylases (Kdm) and methyltransferases (Kmt) were identified in an isogenic lineage of the self-fertilizing hermaphroditic vertebrate, the mangrove rivulus fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus. Evolutionary relationships with other animal demethylases and methyltransferases were examined, and expression patterns during embryonic development and in adult tissues were characterized. Twenty-five Kdm orthologues (Jarid2, Jmjd1c, Jmjd4, Jmjd6, Jmjd7, Jmjd8, Kdm1a, Kdm1b, Kdm2a, Kdm2b, Kdm3b, Kdm4a, Kdm4b, Kthn4c, Kdm5a, Kdm5b, Kdm5c, Kdm6a, Kdm6b, Kdm7a, Kdm8, Kdm9, UTY, Phf2 and Phf8) and forty-eight Kmt orthologues (Ezh1, Ezh2, Setd2, Nsd1, Nsd2, Nsd3, Ash1l, Kmt2e, Setd5, Prdm1, Prdm2, Prdm4, Prdm5, Prdm6, Prdm8, Prdm9, Prdm10, Prdm11, Prdm12, Prdm13, Prdm14, Prdm15, Prdm16, Setd3, Setd4, Setd6, Setd1a, Setd1b, Kmt2a, Kmt2b, Kmt2c, Kmt2d, Kmt5a, Kmt5b, Ehmt1, Ehmt2, Suv39h1, Setmar, Setdb1, Setdb2, Smyd1, Smyd2, Smyd3, Smyd4, Smyd5, Setd7, Setd9, Dot1l) were discovered. Expression patterns of both Kdm and Kmt were variable during embryonic development with a peak in gastrula stage and a reduction in later embryogenesis. Expression of both Kdm and Kmt was higher in male brains compared to hermaphrodite brains whereas specific expression patterns of Kdm and Kmt were observed in the hermaphrodite ovotestes and male testes, respectively. Putative histone demethylases (Kdm) and methyltransferases (Kmt) were for the first time characterized in a teleost besides zebrafish, the mangrove rivulus. Their domain conservation and expression profiles suggest that they might play important roles during development, gametogenesis and neurogenesis, which raises questions about epigenetic regulation of these processes by histone lysine methylation in K. marmoratus. Due to its peculiar mode of reproduction and the natural occurrence of isogenic lineages, this new model species is of great interest for understanding epigenetic contributions to the regulation of development and reproduction.

AB Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is a high density lipoprotein (HDL)-binding protein which defense the body against oxidative stress. To investigate the role of the PON1 gene in CCHF, we screened the genotypes of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (Q192R [rs662] and L55M [rs854560]) in CCHF patients stratified according to course of severity and mortality by using PCR-based RFLP assay. Overall, 132 patients diagnosed as CCHF were enrolled in this study. The frequencies of the three genotypes and two alleles of Q192R and L55M polymorphisms didn't show any statistically significant differences in terms of mortality and disease severity (p > 0.05). Any statistically significant differences were not found between severe and mild and fatal and non-fatal CCHF patients according to seven composite genotypes (p > 0.05). When we analyzed the clinical characteristics of CCHF patients stratified according to PON1gene polymorphisms, any statistically significant differences were not also observed (p > 0.05). Our study showed no possible association between genotypes of PON1 gene Q192R and L55M polymorphisms and CCHF.

AB The SWI/SNF complex is a multimeric chromatin remodeling complex that has vital roles in regulating gene expression and cancer development. However, to date few studies have deeply explored the mechanism of SMARCA2 inactivation. We applied multi-omics analysis to explore the mechanism of SMARCA2 inactivation in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and performed the dCas9-DNMT3a system to evaluate the role of promoter methylation in SMARCA2 transcriptional regulation. We also assessed the tumor suppressing roles of SMARCA2 in lung cancer development by in vitro experiments. SMARCA2 promoter hypermethylation was significantly associated with decreased expression of SMARCA2. This result was further confirmed in the results of our own tissues. In addition, we observed that the mRNA level decreased by about 3 folds while the CpG island of promoter is nearly 30% hypermethylated by dCas9-DNMT3a system in H1299 cells. We identified SMARCA2 as a tumor suppressor gene whose expression was downregulated in lung cancers. Its inactivation was significantly associated with the poor survival of lung cancer patients [hazard ratio, HR = 0.35 (0.27-0.45)]. Besides, we found that SMARCA2 was a tumor suppressor and can significantly inhibit lung cancer cell vitality. We found that promoter hypermethylation contribute to the inactivation of SMARCA2. We also verified its oncogenetic roles of BRM inactivation in lung adenocarcinoma, which may provide a potential target for the clinical treatment.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) play a key role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study was aimed to investigate the effects of miR-3926 on the biological activities of RASFs. The results showed that miR-3926 was significantly down-regulated in RASFs and RA synovial tissue. Overexpression of miR-3926 significantly inhibited RASFs proliferation and decreased the secretion of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 in RASFs. TLR5 was identified to be a direct target of miR-3926. TLR5 showed an opposite expression trends with miR-3926 in RASFs and RA synovial tissue. Overexpression of miR-3926 led to a reduction of endogenous TLR5 in RASFs, whereas down-regulation of miR-3926 increased TLR5 expression. Knocking down of TLR5 significantly inhibited RASFs proliferation and inflammatory cytokines secretion. Rescue experiments with a miR-3926-resistant variant of TLR5 showed that overexpression of TLR5 restored RASFs proliferation and inflammatory cytokines secretion in miR-3926-overexpressing RASFs. In conclusion, miR-3926 is downregulated in RA synovial tissues and its overexpression caused the inhibitory effects on RASF proliferation and inflammatory cytokines secretion by targeting TLR5. The miR-3926/TLR5 pathway may represent a novel target for prevention and treatment of RA.

AB Periodontal Disease is an infectious and inflammatory disorder triggered mainly by periodontopathogenic bacteria, however, as a multifactorial disease, several factors modulate its progression, namely, genetic factors. Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize molecular patterns present in pathogens and trigger an immune response against them. Thus, sequences variants in TLR genes seem to have the potential to modify the predisposition to Periodontal Disease and its progression. Based on this fact, TLR9 gene were analysed in a case-control study. DNA was obtained from 90 dogs (50 control and 40 cases) and a fragment of TLR9 gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced. The variants were identified by comparison with the dog wild type sequences. Our results suggest that rs375556098 and rs201959275 polymorphisms in the TLR9 gene are good candidates to become biomarkers of the canine predisposition to Periodontal Disease. It's important to notice that these polymorphic sites exist in Human exactly in the same codon. Since the dog is the best animal model to replicate the pathophysiological mechanisms of human Periodontal Disease, these results can potentially be extrapolated to humans.

DT Article

AB Objectives: Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) plays a crucial role in the innate immune response against viral infections. The failure of this system may result, in an attenuated immune response against HBV. Recent research has focused on the possibility of targeting the defects in TLR9 pathway as a novel approach for anti-HBV treatment. Our study aimed to assess the impact of both TLR9 rs5743836 and rs187084 polymorphisms on spontaneous HBV clearance in Moroccan chronic HBV carriers.
   Methods: In this study, 239 individuals chronically infected with HBV (CHB) and 133 subjects who spontaneously resolved the infection (SRB) were genotyped using a Taqman allelic discrimination assay.
   Results/conclusion: Remarkably, we observed a dosage effect of both SNPs on viral loads; with a significant increase of circulating HBV DNA within AA, AG to GG rs5743836 genotypes, whereas the inverse phenomenon was noticed within rs187084 genotypes. There were no consistent association between TLR9 polymorphisms and spontaneous clearance of HBV, however, a significant association was observed between rs187084 AA genotype and HBV progression to advanced liver disease. Further studies on larger populations might be necessary to understand the modulating effect of TLR9 polymorphisms on HBV loads that remain a viral factor of paramount importance to predict HCC development.

AB Jab1/CSN5 is a conserved multifunctional protein involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Deregulation of Jab1/CSN5 can exert dramatic effects on diverse cellular functions, including DNA repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and signal transduction, all of which are critical for tumor development. Although increasing evidence has demonstrated that Jab1/CSN5 was overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and usually correlated with poor prognosis, little was known about the underlying regulatory principles that coordinated its function. In this review, we highlight recent advances of the oncogenic role of Jab1/CSN5 and its potential as a therapeutic target for anticancer intervention.

AB The in vitro process of chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induces a pre-apoptotic hypertrophic phenotype, guided by the active status of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway. To achieve a stable chondrocyte phenotype for cartilage tissue engineering, it is necessary to gain a better understanding of specific genes that regulate the cartilage tissue phenotype. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of tissue samples from bone, cartilage, growth plate and muscle show that Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a natural WNT canonical signaling inhibitor, is expressed in cartilage tissue. This observation reinforces the concept that inhibition of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway is critical for preventing avoid chondrocyte hypertrophy in vitro. We used two doses of DKK1 in a pellet cell culture system to inhibit the terminal differentiation of chondrocytes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Bone marrow MSCs were cultured in chondrogenic induction medium with 50 and 200 ng/ml of DKK1 for 21 days. The highest doses of DKK1 reduce beta-catenin expression and nuclear localization at day 21, concomitant with reduced expression and activity of hypertrophy markers collagen type X (COL10A1) and alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), thus decreasing the pre-hypertrophic chondrocyte population. Furthermore, DKK1 stimulated expression of collagen type II (COL2A1) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which represent healthy articular cartilage markers. We conclude that exogenous DKK1 impedes chondrocyte progression into a prehypertrophic stage and stimulates expression of healthy articular cartilage markers by blocking the WNT/beta-catenin pathway. Hence, DKK1 may promote a mature healthy articular cartilage phenotype and facilitate cartilage tissue engineering for joint repair.

AB Horses (Equus caballus) have been domesticated and bred to enhance speed, strength, and agility. Members of the Equus caballus Endogenous Retrovirus (EqERV) family affect several of these abilities in horses. EqERV elements have been integrated in the horse genome during evolution and generate repeat elements such as long terminal repeats (LTRs). LTR sequences are involved in retrovirus replication and play an essential function in post transcriptional control mechanisms, such as by providing binding sites for microRNAs (miRNAs) or generating miRNA precursors. In this study, we identified a novel miRNA derived from EqERV-E1 LTR using various bioinformatics tools. To examine the relationship between EqERV-E1 LTR and similar elements, we used BLAST2seq and phylogenetic analysis. LTR sequences were located in the untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs and also formed the stem-loop secondary structure. The sequence was registered in the DDBJ database as LTR derived miRNA under the accession number corresponding to LC383797 (referred to eca-miR-1804). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to confirm the expression of eca-miR-1804 and the similar miR1255a, showed an almost identical expression pattern in eight different equine tissues. Therefore, these data imply that the LTR could function as an miRNA, which is expressed in the examined equine tissues. In addition, the current study provides inputs for additional functional studies concerning the LTR of other EqERV families.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) has been one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in global. The differential expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in CRC plasma of patients have the potential to serve as a diagnostic biomarker. We conducted a four-stage study to identify the potential plasma miRNAs for CRC detection. In the initial screening phase, Exiqon panel (miRCURY-Ready-to-Use-PCR-Human-panel-I + II-V1.M) including 3 CRC pools and 1 normal controls (NCs) pool were applied to acquire miRNA profiles. In the training stage (30 CRC VS. 30 NCs) and testing stage (79 CRC VS. 76 NCs), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to conduct candidate miRNA profiles. Then the identified miRNAs were verified in external validation stage (30 CRC VS. 26 NCs). Expression levels of identified miRNAs were assessed in tissue samples (24 pairs) and plasma exosomes (18 CRC VS. 18 NCs). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. Seven miRNAs (miR-103a-3p, miR-127-3p, miR-151a-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-18a-5p and miR-18b-5p) were significantly overexpressed in CRC compared with NCs. Area under the ROC curve of the seven-miRNA signature was 0.762, 0.824 and 0.895 for the training, testing and the external validation stages, respectively. Additionally, miR-103a-3p, miR-127-3p, miR-17-5p and miR-18a-5p were discovered significantly up-regulated in CRC tissues; while miR-17-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-18a-5p and miR-18b-5p were significantly elevated in CRC plasma exosomes. In conclusion, we established a seven-miRNA signature in the peripheral plasma for CRC detection.

AB Mounting evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in distinct physiological and pathological states. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a critical event in the development of hepatic fibrosis (HF). LncRNAs have recently been revealed to be involved in HSC activation as ceRNAs. CeRNA analysis tremendously expands the functional information of proteins, DNA and coding and noncoding RNA. In addition, many validated ceRNA networks, including the traditional ceRNA/mRNA/miRNA, participate in the initiation and progress of HF, and additional work is needed in elucidating the potential of ceRNAs in precancer diagnosis, prognosis and providing new therapeutic methods for HF reversion.

AB Paclitaxel, which isolated from Taxes brevifolia, is recently started to be used against prostate cancer treatment and it is a very effective compound against cancer. In this study, we aimed to test the synergistic effect of two plant active compounds (sulphoraphane (SFN) and silymarin (SILY)) and several endemic plant species from Turkey (such as Phlomis leucophracta, Rubia davisiana, Alkanna tinctoria), which are known to have antic-arcinogenic effect on androgen-independent PC3 and DU145, and androgen-dependent VCaP prostate cancer cell lines, with paclitaxel on the expression of cell cycle signaling and apoptosis regulator genes.
   Herbal substances and endemic herbal extracts were combined with Paclitaxel drug. IC50 doses were identified as real-time online. The most effective synergistic doses were determined according to isobologram analysis. The apoptotic effects of effective combined doses were evaluated by TUNEL, Annexin V, and JC-1 methods. Apoptotic and/or cell cycle arrest effects of confirmed combined doses on the expression of genes in these pathways were assessed by real-time online.
   Endemic plant extracts (Alkanna tinctoria, Phlomis leucophracta and Rubia davisiana, IC50 < 220 mu g/ml) and herbal substances (SILY, and SFN IC50 < 130 mu M) indicated antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in prostate cancer cell lines. They testified to the synergistic effect of paclitaxel with endemic plant extracts (Combination Index CI, ED50 < 0.41). The combinations, which indicate the synergistic effect was increased to the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio by suppressing Bcl-2 gene expression into the prostate cancer cell lines. Besides, they increased the expression of TNERSF10A, TNFRSF1A, CHEK1, CDKN1A, CDKN2B, CDK8, CDKN3 and CASP14 and decreased BAD, CDK5RAP1, CDC20, cyclin H, CDK5RAP1, CDC20.
   The effective doses of paclitaxel were reduced and G2/M arrest was induced by the endemic plant extracts and herbal substances that indicate a synergistic effect with paclitaxel. By using different combination of herbal extracts or active substances with paclitaxel, more economical and efficient treatment strategies can be developed.

AB Purpose: MicroRNAs are involved in diverse biological processes and their dysregulation is a common event in various diseases including breast cancer. Breast cancer is a major threat to women's health. This study was designed to examine the expression levels of miR-9 and miR-34a in breast tumor tissue samples and plasma of breast cancer patients, compare their expression pattern between tissue samples and plasma samples of patients and analyze their relationship with tumor clinical features. Also, the potential of these miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer was investigated.
   Materials and methods: The expression levels of miR-9, miR-34a and CDH1 were measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Delta Delta ct method. Data were analyzed using t-test and one-way ANOVA. The sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
   Results and discussion: The expression levels of miR-9 and miR-34a were significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues (fold change = 0.26, p = 0.0051 for miR-9 and fold change = 0.55, p = 0.021 for miR-34a). While no significant difference was observed in the expression levels of miR-9 (p = 0.205) and miR-34a (p = 0.132) in plasma samples of patients compared to normal plasma. CDH1 expression in tumor tissue was not significantly different from normal tissue (p = 0.33). We found that expression level of miR-9 in patients with tumor size larger than 5 cm (p = 0.026) and expression level of miR-34a in patients with higher stage (Ill & IV, p = 0.03) were significantly down-regulated. Also miR-34a expression level was positively correlated with patient's age (p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: According to the ROC curves, the area under the curve (AUC) of miR-9 in tissue was 0.71 (p = 0.009) with sensitivity 83.33% and specificity 70.37%. The AUC for miR-34a in tissue was 0.72 (p = 0.007) with sensitivity 72% and specificity 76%. Thus miR-9 and miR-34a have the capability for distinguishing tumor tissues from healthy tissues and the study of their expression levels in tissue may be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of breast cancer patients from healthy women.

   Including 33 new patients, a total of 28 females (Age 25,82 +/- 12,1 Range 8-46) and 16 males (Age 24,56 +/- 15,04 Range 2-48) were investigated. Ten different disease-causing variants were found two of them being novel. One patient had co-existing familial mediteranian fever, one had celiac disease and three had rheumatological disorders. Lipoprotein (a) levels were elevated in 17,6%, homocysteine in 22,2%, total and low density cholesterol in 12% and antithrombin 3 levels were elevated in 13,3%. One patient was found to be heterozygous for prothrombin p.G20210A disease-causing variant (5,8%) and two for factor V Leiden disease causing variant (11,7%). Anticardiolipin IgM antibody was found to be positive in 11,7%. The patients with abnormal cranial imaging were also noticed to have additional risk factors for thrombosis.
   This study provides the largest data about Fabry patients from Turkey and implies that co-existing risk factors unrelated to Fabry Disease have significant association with the presence of clinical symptoms in females and might cause an early and severe clinical course in males.

AB This study aims to investigate key genes involved in molecular regulatory networks of cucumber sex determination. Genome-wide high-throughput RNA sequencing was performed for young apical buds of gynoecious and weak female cucumber at three growth stages (one-leaf one-bud, three-leaf one-bud, and five-leaf one-bud). Seven comparisons from the same cultivar at three different stages and at the same stage between the two cultivars were analyzed, and the results revealed that compared with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in weak female cucumber, more genes were upregulated at the one-leaf one-bud stage and downregulated at the three-leaf one-bud stage in gynoecious cucumber. In addition, there were four kinds of gene expression trends (0, 1, 6, and 7), which were significantly enriched in gynoecious cucumber, while only two kinds of gene expression trends (5 and 6) were significantly enriched in weak female cucumber. Together with the data of the Gene Ontology (GO), pathway, gene expression trends and qRT-PCR, nine genes were identified and considered as candidate genes that may be involved in sex differentiation regulation in cucumber. These genes included Cs-MCM6, Cs-ACTS, Cs-XRCC4, Cs-MCM2, Cs-CDC45, Cs-Dpri, Cs-H2B, Cs-CDC20 and Cs-CNGC1. Among these genes, five genes (Cs-MCM6, Cs-MCM2, Cs-CDC45, Cs-Dpri, and Cs-CDC20) were involved in the cell cycle pathway, suggesting that the cell cycle pathway may play an important role in sex determination in cucumber.

AB Dof proteins comprise a plant-specific transcription factor family involved in regulation of many plant processes. Despite their diverse roles, little information is available in cassava (Manihot esculenta, Euphorbiaceae), the sixth major staple crop in the world. This study presents the first genome-wide identification of Dof family genes in cassava, resulting in 45 family members that are unevenly distributed across 17 out of the 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis assigned these genes into eight groups representing four subfamilies. Synteny analysis and BRH (Best Reciprocal Hit) method were also adopted to study evolutionary relationships. Among 21 MeDof duplicates identified, the majority of them were derived from the recent whole-genome duplication (WGD), whereas only one from local duplication. Transcriptional profiling revealed diverse expression patterns among various tissues, and further comparison of conserved motifs and expression profiles revealed divergence of MeDof duplicates. These findings provide valuable information for functional analysis of Dof genes in cassava.

AB Torafugu myosin heavy chain gene, MYHM2528-1, is specifically expressed in neonatal slow and fast muscle fibers, suggesting its functional role in indeterminate muscle growth in fish. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of MYHM2528-1 involved in indeterminate muscle growth in fish remained unknown. We previously isolated a 2100 bp 5'-flanking sequence of torafugu MYHM2528-1 that showed sufficient promoter activity to allow specific gene expression in neonatal muscle fibers of zebrafish. Here, we examined the cis-regulatory mechanism of 2100 bp 5'-flanking region of torafugu MYHM2528-1 using deletion-mutation analysis in zebrafish embryo. We discovered that myoblast determining factor (MyoD) binding elements play a key role and participate in the transcriptional regulation of MYHM2528-1 expression in zebrafish embryos. We further discovered that paired box protein (Pax3) are required for promoting MYHM2528-1 expression and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) binding sites participate in the transcriptional regulation of MYHM2528-1 expression in slow/fast skeletal muscles. Our study also confirmed that the nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) binding sites take part in the transcriptional regulation of MYHM2528-1 expression in slow and fast muscles fiber in relation to indeterminate muscle growth. These results obviously confirmed that multiple cis-elements in the 5'-flanking region of MYHM2528-1 function in the transcriptional regulation of its expression.

AB This paper examines the growing pressures and incentives encouraging research misconduct, along with the consequences, as illustrated by the case of business school research. Drawing on a review of the literature on different theoretical approaches to analysing organizational misconduct, we develop a formal taxonomy distinguishing appropriate conduct from blatantly inappropriate misconduct but with a specific focus on the 'grey' areas between these extremes in the form of questionable and inappropriate behaviour. We identify various sources of research misbehaviour and different categories of those affected. The aim is to provide a clearer understanding of what research behaviour is deemed appropriate or not, which stakeholders it affects, and the pressures and incentives likely to exacerbate such misconduct. We conclude with a discussion of how the taxonomy can help shape future good research practice (thereby setting a better example to students), and offer some propositions for future research.

AB The incidence of revealed fraud and dishonesty in academia is on the rise, and so is the number of studies seeking to explain scientific misconduct. This paper builds on the concepts of competing logics and institutional fields to analyze a serious case of medical and scientific misconduct at a leading research institute, Karolinska in Sweden, home to the Nobel Prize in Medicine.
   By distinguishing between a market-oriented, a medical and an academic logic, the study analyzes how various actors - executives, research leaders, co-authors, journal editors, medical doctors, science bloggers, investigative journalists and documentary filmmakers - sustained or tried to expose the misconduct. Despite repeated warnings from patient-responsible doctors and external academic reviewers, Karolinska protected the surgeon, Paolo Macchiarini, until a documentary film at the Swedish national public TV exposed the fraud which led to public inquiries and proposals for a new national ethics legislation.
   The analysis illustrates the power of a market-oriented logic focused on brand and image at the research institute and at a leading journal, but also the perseverance of the logics of scientific scrutiny and medical care among practicing doctors and independent academics although the carriers of these logics were less well organized than the carriers of the market-oriented logic. Furthermore, the analysis shows the problem of fragmented control in the academic institutional field. The discussion of remedies compares the Karolinska case, where media actors were instrumental in sanctioning the perpetrators, with a similar instance of medical misconduct at Duke in the US where the government agency (ORI) intervened and shows the limitations of both types of actors. The conclusion highlights the importance of studying misconduct management and institution-building in different fields to develop effective remedies

AB Science is increasingly a team activity, and the size of the teams has been growing. At the same time, there are concerns about an increasing rate of pathologies in science. The growth of team science suggests the need to look beyond individual-level explanations and focus on organizational structures and institutional contexts to explain pathologies in science. Drawing on the literature on organizational pathologies, we argue that division of labor may be a key factor contributing to pathologies in science. Furthermore, we examine the effects of high-stakes incentives and of institutional corruption as additional predictors of scientific pathologies. Using retractions as an indicator of pathologies, and drawing on a matched sample of 195 retracted papers and 349 paired papers that were not retracted, we develop indicators of the division of labor in the team that produced a paper and find that the rate of retractions is higher as the division of labor increases (net of team size). Additionally, we find that high-stakes incentives and institutional corruption are also associated with increased retractions. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for science policy, in particular for organizing team science projects

TI A walk on the wild side: 'Predatory' journals and information
   asymmetries in scientific evaluations
SO RESEARCH POLICY

DE Scientific misconduct; Academic evaluations
ID PUBLICATION
AB In recent years the academic world has witnessed the mushrooming of journals that falsely pretend to be legitimate academic outlets. We study this phenomenon using information from 46,000 researchers seeking promotion in Italian academia. About 5% of them have published in journals included in the blacklist of 'potential, possible, or probable predatory journals' elaborated by the scholarly librarian Jeffrey Beall. Data from a survey that we conducted among these researchers confirms that at least one third of these journals do not provide peer review or they engage in some other type of irregular editorial practice. We identify two factors that may have spurred publications in dubious journals. First, some of these journals have managed to be included in citation indexes such as Scopus that many institutions consider as a guarantee of quality. Second, we show that authors who publish in these journals are more likely to receive positive assessments when they are evaluated by (randomly selected) committee members who lack research expertise. Overall, our analysis suggests that the proliferation of predatory journals reflects the existence of severe information asymmetries in scientific evaluations.

AB There is limited knowledge on the extent to which scientists may strategically respond to metrics by adopting questionable practices, namely practices that challenge the scientific ethos, and the individual and contextual factors that affect their likelihood. This article aims to fill these gaps by studying the opportunistic use of self-citations, i.e. citations of one's own work to boost metric scores. Based on sociological and economic literature exploring the factors driving scientists' behaviour, we develop hypotheses on the predictors of strategic increase in self-citations. We test the hypotheses in the Italian Higher Education system, where promotion to professorial positions is regulated by a national habilitation procedure that considers the number of publications and citations received. The sample includes 886 scientists from four of science's main disciplinary sectors, employs different metrics approaches, and covers an observation period beginning in 2002 and ending in 2014. We find that the introduction of a regulation that links the possibility of career advancement to the number of citations received is related to a strong and significant increase in self-citations among scientists who can benefit the most from increasing citations, namely assistant professors, associate professors and relatively less cited scientists, and in particular among social scientists. Our findings suggest that while metrics are introduced to spur virtuous behaviours, when not properly designed they favour the usage of questionable practices.

AB Among the various forms of academic misconduct, text recycling or self-plagiarism holds a particularly contentious position as a new way to game the reward system of science. A recent case of alleged 'self-plagiarism' by the prominent Dutch economist Peter Nijkamp has attracted much public and regulatory attention in the Netherlands. During the Nijkamp controversy, it became evident that many questions around text recycling have only partly been answered and that much uncertainty still exists. While the conditions of fair text reuse have been specified more clearly in the wake of this case, the extent and causes of problematic text recycling remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the extent of problematic text recycling in order to obtain understanding of its occurrence in four research areas: biochemistry & molecular biology, economics, history and psychology. We also investigated some potential reasons and motives for authors to recycle their text, by testing current hypotheses in scholarly literature regarding the causes of text recycling. To this end, an analysis was performed on 922 journal articles, using the Turnitin plagiarism detection software, followed by close manual interpretation of the results. We observed considerable levels of problematic text recycling, particularly in economics and psychology, while it became clear that the extent of text recycling varies substantially between research fields. In addition, we found evidence that more productive authors are more likely to recycle their papers. In addition, the analysis provides insight into the influence of the number of authors and the existence of editorial policies on the occurrence of problematic text recycling.

AB A current challenge for the scientific community is the choice of appropriate policies to reduce the rate of false positives. Existing proposals differ in whether to prioritize tackling omission through transparency requirements, punishing more severe transgressions, or possibly both. We use a formal model to evaluate these possible solutions. We find that a policy that prohibitively increases the cost of 'misdemeanor' types of questionable research practices robustly decreases the overall rate of researcher misconduct, because the rate of 'felonies', such as fabrication, also decreases. Therefore proposals that aim to prevent lying by omission by enforcing reporting guidelines are likely to be effective in reducing researcher misconduct, but measures such as government audits (purported to counteract pure fraud) can backfire. Moreover, we find that an increase in the rewards of publication need not increase overall misconduct.

AB Recent highly publicized cases of scientific misconduct have raised concerns about its consequences for academic careers. Previous and anecdotal evidence suggests that these reach far beyond the fraudulent scientist and (his or) her career, affecting coauthors and institutions. Here we show that the negative effects of scientific misconduct spill over to uninvolved prior collaborators: compared to a control group, prior collaborators of misconducting scientists, who have no connection to the misconduct case, are cited 89% less often afterwards. We suggest that the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is stigmatization by mere association. The result suggests that scientific misconduct generates large indirect costs in the form of mistrust towards a wider range of research findings than was previously assumed. The far-reaching fallout of misconduct implies that potential whistleblowers might be disinclined to make their concerns public in order to protect their own reputation and career.

A change in magnetic field causes variation in electric polarization, attributed to the destruction of space modulated spin antiferromagnetic structure with the PbTiO3 addition. This behavior also results in the increase in magnetic parameters as the coercive field of the composites increases with the increase in PbTiO3 contents. The analysis demonstrates that the magneto-electric coupling in the prepared ferromagnetic/ferroelectric composites is dominant at room temperature, quite feasible for modern day devices.

AB Large area MoS2/Si heterojunction-based solar cell was prepared in which MoS2 thin film was directly grown on p-Si wafer using sol-gel method. Chemical bonding and microstructure analysis show that the MoS2 film was in the initial region of transition from amorphous to microcrystalline phase. Compared with the ITO/p-Si/Ag structure without MoS2, the open-circuit voltage (V-OC), short-circuit current density (J(SC)) and fill factor (FF) of the ITO/MoS2/p-Si/Ag solar cell were improved dramatically, and the conversion efficiency (CE) increased from 1.1% to 4.6%. The insertion of MoS2 film reduced the inter-face defects concentration and increased the depletion region width of the solar cell, showing its enhancement effect on both chemical passivation and field passivation.

AB Carbon dots (CDs) and CDs-polymer composites were one-step synthesized in a hydrothermal process using hexamethylenetetramine and polycarbonate as precursors. Their optical properties and the application as solid-state phosphors towards white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were thoroughly investigated. CDs solutions exhibit strong yellow emission under blue illumination and possess excitation-independent luminescent behavior. Owing to precursor polymerization, CDs-polymer composites were synthesized in one step. The dried CDs-polymer composite powders exhibit excellent optical stability and no luminescence quenching was observed. Under light blue illumination, the powders show broad yellow luminescence with the peak wavelength centered at 550 nm and PL quantum yield of 14.86%. For their practical applications, stable white light emission was demonstrated by coating a 455 nm blue LED with the powders. Our research offers a valuable reference for growing CDs-polymer composites in a facile, low-cost and low-temperature hydrothermal process and developing white LEDs with light blue LEDs and metal-free phosphors.

AB Two types of austenite morphologies, equiaxed and Widmanstatten, were produced through different phase transformation routes to evaluate the critical factors affecting the intergranular corrosion susceptibility in a 2205 duplex stainless steel. These distinct austenite morphologies behaved quite differently in secondary phase precipitation on exposure to sensitization temperature. Although the Widmanstatten microstructure was found to have a larger degree of coherent ferrite/austenite interface area compared with the equiaxed one, it showed a higher degree of sensitization. It was clarified that, in addition to the ferrite/austenite interface coherency, the extent of an interface area and presence of un-stable ferrite also play prominent roles in intergranular corrosion susceptibility.

   composites; Thick films; Flame spray
AB Marine biofouling has emerged as worldwide serious problems for artificial marine infrastructures. Among the measures taken so far to solve the abovementioned problems, construction of an antifouling layer has been proven to be effective in offering long-term antifouling performances. Antifouling based on the use of biocides is the most important method in modern maritime industries. While tributyltin (TBT)-based self-polishing coatings are being replaced by other biocide-releasing coatings, the environmental toxicity of these compounds is also under scrutiny. Therefore, there is a significant interest in developing non-toxic technologies. Green biocides can also be extracted from many types of organisms including terrestrial plants, sea creatures and bacteria. The capsaicin was extracted from chili pepper. In this study, flame sprayed high density polyethylene (HDPE)-capsaicin composite coatings were developed for marine antifouling applications. Capsaicin powder were fixed by polymer-based substrate and distributed evenly. Antifouling performances of the films were assessed by examining survival and colonization behaviors of E. coli and Bacillus sp. bacteria and Phaeodactylum tricomutum. Antifouling test indicated excellent antibacterial properties of HDPE-capsaicin composite coatings against both gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive marine Bacillus sp. bacteria. Excellent antifouling performances against bacteria and algae of the thermal sprayed composite coatings give clear insight into their potential applications as environmentally friendly antifouling layers in the marine environment.

AB In this work selenium-polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000) composite network was synthesized. Simple and inexpensive one-pot method was performed at room temperature. Saturated water solution of diethyl ether acted as a solvent and ascorbic acid was used as a reduction agent for sodium selenite. Prepared orange selenium-PEG6000 solid composite was characterised by SEM, XRD and TEM measurements. The antibacterial activity of prepared sample was tested on Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis (DBM 2124) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (DBM 3138). Synthesized material showed antibacterial activity on S. epidermidis, however, E. coli bacteria were not inhibited. Although bulk-like, the material has a large surface area and anti-microbial properties of nano-sized amorphous selenium. Thus it can be used in specific applications, e.g. as a special targeted drug or for selective antimicrobial coating. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-response shape memory polymers (SMPs) received significant attention due to their deformation with a temporary shape, and retain their original shape when exposed to an external stimulus such as temperature, light, and electricity. In this study, a novel reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/water-borne epoxy (WEP)/RGO sandwich structure composite film was fabricated and investigated. The results showed that the composite film exhibited excellent thermo-, electro- and light-responsive shape memory effect, as a potential SMP that can be used for the sensors, switching devices, deployable structures, and medical apparatus.

AB Nanoscale metal composite materials with tunable properties have attracted interest in many areas, such as catalysis, electronics, and photography. Typical matrices include zeolites, metal oxides, or polymer films. This study reports for first time the incorporation of a dinuclear copper (II) complex in polyethylene oxide (PEO) fiber mat by electrospinning. EPR studies have shown that the complex remained intact and stable within the polymer fibers. The fiber morphology was characterized by SEM. The absorption of the complex allowed to monitor the composition and distribution of the metal on the material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the present paper reports on the precipitation evolution in Mg-Gd-Ag alloy aged at 200 degrees C. Basal gamma '' precipitates serve as the key strengthening structures in the under-aged sample. The formation of gamma '' involves the displacement of a (0 0 0 1) layer along [1 1 (2) over bar 0](Mg), as proved by HAADF observations from both [1 1 (2) over bar 0](Mg) and [1 0 (1) over bar 0](Mg). Under the peak-age condition, the alloy is strengthened by basal gamma '' and prismatic beta '. At Mg the over-age stage, coarse particles, which are enriched with Ag and Gd, and highly stacked gamma '' form within the alloy. No gamma ' is observed through the ageing of this Mg-Gd-Ag alloy.

AB The porous NiFe2O4/Si microspheres (NFO/Si) are prepared by nano silicon embedment into NFO using liquid nitrogen quenching and freeze-drying methods. Compared with pure nano silicon or NFO as lithium-ion battery anode, the porous NFO/Si microspheres deliver a promising specific capacity up to 906 mAh g (1) after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.1 A g (1). The composite electrode materials also demonstrate excellent rate performance at high current density. The improved electrochemical properties are due to the synergistic effect of high capacity silicon embedment in porous NFO/Si microspheres, which improves the Li+ intercalation-deintercalation process. The porous NFO/Si microspheres exhibits the excellent lithium-ion storage as anode materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Au as a cocatalyst was deposited on the surface of solid solution Bi0.5Y0.5VO4 by a photodeposition method for photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Au particles loaded on the surface of Bi0.5Y0.5VO4 apparently enhanced the photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction toward CO evolution. The highest rate of CO evolution was obtained over 1.0 wt% Au/Bi0.5Y0.5VO4, reaching 3.5 times of that of bare Bi0.5Y0.5VO4. The improved photocatalytic performance was assigned to the lower overpotential of Au/Bi0.5Y0.5VO4 for CO evolution than that of bare Bi0.5Y0.5VO4 as well as the formation of Schottky barrier, which promotes the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.

AB Nitrogen ions doped TiO2 nanotubes (N-TNTs) were synthesized via ion implantation and anodization. Graphene was deposited on the surface of N-TNTs during anodization. After being annealed at the temperature of 450 degrees C, the samples were determined using FE-SEM, XRD, XPS, and UV-Vis DRS. The photoelectric performance of the samples was confirmed by transient photocurrent. The results indicated that morphology and structure of N-TNTs were improved due to ion implantation. Because of the combustion of deposited graphene during the annealing process, the degree of crystallinity of N-TNTs was improved, and the contents of substitutional N increased. The TNTs modified by ion implantation and combustion of graphene exhibited the best photoelectric performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PRECURSOR
AB PbO2 electrode is one of crucial materials in electrochemical field, however, the fabrications of nanostructured PbO2 materials are highly confined to the template method. In this work, the nanostructured PbO2 materials were controllably synthesized by template-free electrodeposition method. It is found that the microstructure of PbO2 material was highly depended on the electrochemical deposition models, i.e., cyclic voltammetry (CV) method, potentiostatic method (PM), pulse potentiostatic method (PPM) and pulse galvanostatic method (PGM). Especially, PbO2 nanorod built by nanoparticles with chrysanthemum-like array synthesized in the absence of template by pulse potential deposition method showed high specific capacitance and good stability for supercapacitor application.

AB In this paper, three kinds of natural polymer materials, silk fibroin (SF), gelatin (GT), and nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA), are mixed as 3D printing bioink to mimic protein polysaccharide and collagen fibers in natural articular cartilage. By changing the SF content, SF/GT/n-HA composite scaffolds with different ratios are prepared using 3D bioprinting technology. The microstructure and morphology, biological properties and mechanical properties of composite scaffolds are characterized. The results show that the printing precision of the bioink with 10% SF is best, and the composite scaffold with 10% SF also exhibits better mechanical properties, whose tensile elastic modulus is 10.60 +/- 032 MPa and the compression elastic modulus is 1.22 +/- 0.06 MPa. These studies are helpful to understand the interaction between SF, GT and n-HA, and provide a theoretical basis for the preparation of better silk fibroin-based composite scaffolds.

AB We discovered that water vapor enhanced the CO2 absorption capacity of sodium orthosilicate (Li3NaSiO4) at as low as room temperature (RT) and the CO2 absorption property of Li3NaSiO4 in the presence of water vapor was larger than that of Li3NaSiO4 under a dry CO2 flow at high temperatures. Li3NaSiO4 powders were synthesized by heating a mixture of LiNO3, NaNO3, and amorphous SiO2 at 800 degrees C for 5 h in air. Thermogravimetry analysis shows that CO2 absorption of Li3NaSiO4, at RT, increased as a function of relative humidity and CO2 concentration. CO2 absorption of Li3NaSiO4 in the presence of water vapor resulted in the formation of NaHCO3 and Li2SiO3, as observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), whereas >300 degrees C, Li3NaSiO4 reacted with CO2 to produce LiNaCO3 and Li2SiO3 under a dry CO2 flow. The CO2 absorption capacity of Li3NaSiO4, at RT, was enhanced in the presence of water vapor compared with Li3NaSiO4 under a dry CO2 flow at high temperatures. XRD determined that Li3NaSiO4 was regenerated by the heat treatment of the CO2-absorbed Li3NaSiO4 at 600 degrees C. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ti/Fe bimetallic plate was joined by Cu20V filler. Ti/Fe interface was characterized by fine dendrite structures (beta-Ti + FeTi) with hardness ranging from 11 to 16 GPa. These fine dendrites were transformed into coarse cellular structures (CuTi2) when approaching Cu20V weld metal (WM). Cu4Ti and V(s,s) phases were dominant in the central of Cu2OV WM with hardness ranging from 4 to 11 GPa. Complex phase constitutions were observed at Cu20V/Fe WM interface consisted of Cu4Ti, V(s,s), Cu(s,s), sigma-FeV and Fe2Ti phases with hardness ranging from 4 to 18 GPa. A simplified scenario describing how these phases evolution at Cu20V/Fe WM interface was proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cr3+-doped Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) was fabricated by spray drying followed by a solid-state reaction. The crystal structure and morphology of the sample was tested using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental results show that Cr3+-doped LTO not only significantly improved the discharge specific capacity but also maintained the original 1.55-V discharge platform. During the process of discharge-charge, Cr3+-doped LTO showed a long discharge plateau (91.4% of the entire discharge process) at 1.55 V and an ultra-high initial discharge specific capacity of 240.6 mAh g(1) at 0.1 degrees C. Furthermore, it can maintain 144.7 mAh g (1) at 5.0 degrees C after 200cycles, which is 92% of its initial discharge capacity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic materials are receiving more attention in the solar cell due to their better solution process, controllable synthesis, tunable chemical and physical properties. However, the focus problem of compatibility and aggregation is to be solved urgently in organic materials, which inevitably limits them widely application. To this end, an inorganic-organic hybrid materials with wide-band absorption is designed and prepared, that incorporates octavinyl-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane with 6-bromoquanaldine to produce H1, then reacts with squaric acid to design H2, which efficiently avoids the fluorescence quenching due to the steric hindrance. The electrochemical results shows that the energy level of H2 is match well with the commercial dye N719. Hence it shows a better photovoltaic performance based on dye-sensitized solar cell, along with power conversion efficiency up to 7.73% when it is co-sensitized with N719. The hybrid system exhibits good performances in solar cell and long-term stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITES
AB Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are confessed as an effective energy storage materials due to their 2D structure analogues to graphene. Robust 3D architectures of graphene oxide-polypyrrole (GO-PPy) and molybdenum disulfide-polypyrrole (MoS2-PPy) were fabricated by facile, one pot chronoamperometry method to achieve scalable, conductive additive free and binder free supercapacitor electrodes. The electrodeposited GO-PPy and MoS2-PPy electrodes exhibit the specific capacitance of 271 F g(1) and 130 F g(1) respectively at a current density of 1 A g(1). The introduction of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in PPy matrix offered high capacitance, whereas graphene analogue MoS2 improved the structural stability. Pronounced cycling stability (>2000 cycles) and note-worthy capacitive retentions were also displayed by these composites. MoS2-PPy and GO-PPy retain 82 and 64% of its initial capacitance respectively. These findings are backed up by the correlation of structure and electrochemical performance of GO-PPy and MoS2-PPy.

AB Core-shell structured T-ZnOw@Fe composite composed of a dielectric T-ZnOw core and a ferromagnetic Fe shell was synthesized using MOCVD method. Rough alpha-Fe shell was homogeneously deposited on the surface of T-ZnOw. The as-prepared composite exhibits excellent microwave absorption properties with the minimum reflection loss (RL) of -55.6 dB for a thickness of 1.48 mm and the broadest effective absorption bandwidth (less than -10 dB) of 4.56 GHz for a thickness of 1.55-1.66 mm. The enhanced electromagnetic performances are attributed to the enhanced interfacial polarization, natural resonance, and exchange resonance. The results imply that the deposition of alpha-Fe shell on T-ZnOw was an efficient way to fabricate lightweight and high-performance microwave absorption materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aim of the present work is to design a copper azide precursor direct writing ink for primary explosive-on-a-chip. The mixture of water/vinyl alcohol and isopropanol/ethyl cellulose was used as binder. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) used as foaming agent and dodecanol as foam stabilizer were added into the binder to produce plenty of bubbles. 40 wt% of nano-copper powder was added into the binder and the three-dimensional porous precursor ink was obtained. After 24 h of in-situ gas-solid azide reaction, the copper precursor ink was completely transformed into copper azide. An explosive device was designed to verify the detonation performance of the copper azide by direct writing, and the result showed that it can reliably initiate the CL-20 into complete detonation.

ID DELIVERY
AB Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, but its clinical use is restricted by systemic toxicity and tumor multidrug resistance. To overcome these barriers, PEG modified trimethyl chitosan based nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared for the coencapsulation and codelivery of DOX and survivin shRNA-expressing plasmid (iSur-pDNA). These NPs with particle sizes of 181.9 nm and zeta potentials of 20.2 mV exhibited a pH-sensitive release of DOX and a sustained release of iSur-pDNA, which exerted significantly enhanced in vivo antitumor efficacies compared with single administration with DOX or iSur-pDNA. The results indicated that combinational administration of chemotherapeutic drugs and genes based on NPs could be promising in cancer therapy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Construction of heterojunctions is a promising and solid strategy to tune the photocatalytic performance of BiOCI. In this work, flower-like BiOBr/BiOCl heterojunctions (IL-BiOCl) was in situ prepared by N-ethylpyridinium bromide ([BPy]Br) assisted one-step hydrothermal method. The samples were studied by a serials method. The results exhibit that [BPy]Br promotes the specific surface area and the separation rate of photoinduced carriers. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results firmly reveal that BiOBr/BiOCl heterojunctions were successfully constructed. [BPy]Br provides Br source for BiOBr and influences the shape of the IL-BiOCl. Photocatalytic activity of the samples were evaluated, the results reveal that IL-BiOCl possesses higher photocatalytic activity than BiOCl toward decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated sunlight irradiation.

Structural, electrical, and magnetic properties were assessed for the synthesized nanocomposites. The real and imaginary parts of dielectric constants decreased at the lower frequency and then remained constant at the higher frequency for all the three types of nanocomposites. The permeability of the nanocomposites also followed the same order. Mn/Mn5O8 nanorods showed strong ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature although Mn-nanoparticles and Mn5O8 are paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic in nature respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, novel MnWO4/TmVO4 ternary nano-hybrids were synthesized effectively via a simple sonochemical method. The products were characterized in detail with the use of modern analytical techniques including XRD, EDX, TEM, DRS, BET, PL, and VSM. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first report on the synthesis and photocatalytic performance of MnWO4/TmVO4 ternary nano-hybrids in the degradation of rhodamine B (Rh B), 2-naphthol (Na), phenol red (Ph R), and eosin Y (EY) under visible light. Based on the degradation results, MnWO4/TmVO4 is shown to have higher photodegradation ability than pure TmVO4 or MnWO4 nanoparticles. It was also found that maximum degradation (99.2%) is achieved in the case of Rh B dye. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Different weight percentages (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%) of 4,4 '-bipyridine doped polyvinylidene fluoride/potassium iodide/iodine (PVDF/KI/I-2) solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) were prepared by solution casting technique using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent. The crystallinity, ionic conductivity, surface morphology and photovoltaic performance of 4,4 '-bipyridine doped PVDF/KI/I-2 SPEs were examined. The lowest crystallinity of 30% 4,4 '-bipyridine doped PVDF/KI/I-2 SPE was confirmed. The surface morphology of 30% 4,4 '-bipyridine doped PVDF/KI/I-2 SPE has the smallest spherical particles with voids. The 30% 4,4 '-bipyridine doped PVDF/KI/I-2 SPE exhibited the highest ionic conductivity value of 7.77 x 10 (5) Scm (1). This is due to the lowest crystallinity and highest ionic mobility of the electrolyte. The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated using 4,4 '-bipyridine doped PVDF/KI/I-2 SPEs, among them 30% 4,4 '-bipyridine doped PVDF/KI/I-2 SPE used DSSC exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.6% under an illumination of 100 mW/cm(2).

AB A lanthanide-based coordination polymer Tb-2(H(2)dobdc)(3)(DMF)(4) (Tb-MOF), was prepared by the solvothermal reaction. Benefitting from the large amount and uniform distribution of oxygen atom, conjugated aromatic nucleus as active electrochemical reaction sites, Tb-MOF anode exhibits good specific capacity and excellent cycle performance. The initial discharge specific capacity reached 627.5 mAh g (1) and -87.4% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g (1). At the same time, Tb-MOF electrode has an extremely high structural stability, and the capacity retention is maintained at 99.1% even if it is cycled 3000 times at a current density of 0.8 Ag (1). The research results show that this novel rare earth complex electrode has important research value and application potential compared with traditional anode materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Mg-vermiculite (MVerm) with the nano-layered structure was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method at 300 degrees C. The concentration of NaOH solution was found to be the most important factor for the formation of layered MVerm, and the optimal concentration was 2.05 mol/L. The structure, morphology and chemical composition of MVerm with layered structure were demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. The basal spacing among interlayers of the MVerm material characterized by XRD was 1.169 nm. XRF results showed that the chemical composition of the as-synthesized MVerm was closest to the NVerm when the molar ratio of Si/Na was adjusted to 1/2.5. Furthermore, TG-DSC results indicated the as-synthesized MVerm exhibited similar thermal properties with other layered silicate materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new type of strong adsorbent nanostructure Cu3SnS4@C has been first designed and fabricated by two-step hydrothermal synthesis. For removal of anionic dye methyl orange (MO), in striking contrast to the weak adsorption of bare C nanospheres (0.7 mg/g), the Cu3SnS4@C nanostructures exhibit a very strong pH-sensitive adsorption performance with a maximum adsorbability of 65.99 mg/g at pH 5.0 and a minimum value of 8.11 mg/g at pH 11.0, in initial concentration of 70 mg/L MO. The samples' adsorption mechanism could be well explained by pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Such significantly enhanced adsorbability of Cu3SnS4@C could be ascribed to the synergistic adsorption effect of Cu3SnS4 nanoparticles at C nanospheres, which can induce holes transfer and thus lead to massive positive active sites generation on Cu3SnS4@C available for synergistic adsorption anion dye.

AB Iron oxalate/graphene sheet (FeC2O4/Gs) composites with different crystal polymorphs were prepared through simple solvothermal reaction by controlling synthesis temperature. The effect of crystal structure on the morphology and the electrochemical performance was investigated. The results show that the structure and morphology are strikingly different in both phases. The beta-FeC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O/Gs is composed with irregular shaped of nanometer sized rod and sheet particles. In contrast, the composite of a phase is the micron polygonal prism structure which is due to the reordering of hydrogen bonds between inter layer, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance: 916.49 mAh g (1) for the reversible specific capacity, a retention of 66.9% after 50 cycles and nearly 550 mAh g (1) after 200 cycles at 1 C. This work provides a new way for oxalate-based anode materials to modify initial irreversible capacity and improve capacity retention. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that the isothermal annealing at 673 K could transform cementite in the rolled steel from lamella to nano-crystalline state. Against the conventional theory, the low temperature annealing treatment could simultaneously enhance the tensile strength and ductility of the cold rolled steel. The underlying mechanisms of enhancing mechanical properties were analyzed, with a focus on the heterogeneous composite structure of a soft fine-grained matrix embedded with hard nano-scale cementite particles.

AB It's still a big challenge to access a suitable natural derived film with superb flexibility and stable structure for oil/water separation. Herein, we described a facile method to prepare a natural flexible film derived from cajeput bark (CB). The film exhibits superhydrophobic and superoleophilic; the oil adsorption and oil/water separation results showed the film possesses a relative high adsorption capacity and extremely high flux (similar to 2700 L m (2) h (1)) for oil/water separation. Hence, the film, with low-cost, environmental friendly character, accessibility and superb flexibility, might be a promising candidate for the cleanup of oil spill and oil/water separation.

AB Methyl modified silica (Me-SiO2) aerogels are prepared using tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and methyl- triethoxysilane (MTES) as co-precursor through a two-step sol-gel reaction followed by solvent exchange and supercritical drying. They possess tailored dual modal pore structure consisting of mesopores (10-18 nm) from the stacking of TEOS-derived clusters and small mesopores (2-6 nm) from filling and stacking of small MTES-derived clusters. Moreover, the replacing Si-OH groups by Si-CH3 groups on the aerogel's surface makes them excellent hydrophobicity with contact angle up to 148 degrees. The dual modal pore structure and hydrophobicity endow the Me-SiO2 aerogels outstanding adsorbing capability of quality factor Q up to 23 g/g for ethanol and selective adsorption of oil from water, which makes them tremendous potential for applications of oil adsorbing and oil-water separation.

AB Highly crystalline copper indium disulfide (CuInS2) nanospheres morphology thin film have been deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by a single step using an electrospray chemical aerosol deposition (ESCAD) technique. The structural, optical, morphological and electrical properties of the CuInS2 nanospheres thin film is highlighted in this letter. Nanospheres CuInS2 film exhibits hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure with polycrystalline nature. The observed optical absorption in the infrared (IR) and visible region for CuInS2 semiconductor indicates narrow band gap (Eg) nature. Further, Eg value calculated using Tauc's plot which is found to be 1.47 eV. The formation of well-interconnected spherical shaped CuInS2 nanospheres is portrayed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. The photoconductivity of prepared CuInS2 nanospheres morphology film shows significant photocurrent response. The controlled fine aerosol formation in ESCAD leads to the spherical shaped CuInS2 nanospheres deposition on FTO substrate result in pronounced electrical and photophysical properties. So, this work could be facilitated a special interest in developing optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A dual-gradient bainite steel matrix composite was fabricated by direct laser deposition (DLD) method. The decomposition of WC (reinforcements) during DLD is utilized to adjust the gradient microstructure of the composite. Both the matrix morphology and the reinforcement distribution present obvious gradient variation along the deposition direction. The microhardness and impact toughness exhibit the opposite tendency from the bottom to top of the composite, which shows a good agreement with the gradient microstructure. The surface microhardness and impact toughness of the dual-gradient composite are 510 HV and 75 J/cm(2), respectively. The hardness and toughness combination of the composite is superior to most steels for railway frog. The dual-gradient composite has great potential in improving the performance of railway frog.

AB Magnesium alloy Mg-1.0%Zn-0.3%Ca was processed by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) with the aim to refine its microstructure. ECAP was found to reduce the average grain size from 106.0 +/- 2.05 mu m in the initial state to 4.0 +/- 0.19 mu m and 8.0 +/- 0.18 mu m in the transverse and longitudinal sections, respectively. This resulted in a slight strengthening (the yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength rose from 92 and 194 MPa in the initial stat to 106 and 215 MPa after processing, respectively). The main advantage of ECAP is the concurrent increase of tensile elongation from 12.8% to 23.9%. The absence of pronounced strengthening and a significant increase in ductility are associated with the formation of an inclined basal texture, along with activation of prismatic slip during ECAP. It was also shown that ECAP leads to an increase in the fatigue limit of the alloy from 100 MPa to 110 MPa and does not impair its resistance to chemical corrosion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Experimental studies of the effect of variable acceleration achieved by vertical oscillations of a vessel with superfluid helium He-II on the formation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surface of a liquid have been carried out. It is observed that the development of the parametric instability and then Faraday waves on the surface leads to a significant decrease in a heat power and hence a critical velocity of the normal component under the He-II surface, above which the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability starts to develop.

AB In this letter, the effect of Mn on growth mechanism and morphology evolution of CrB2 particles was studied in detail. Results show that without Mn addition, CrB2 can be formed with six plate morphology, while trace Mn addition lead to morphology evolution of CrB2 and forming doped (Cr1-xMnx)B-2 with square lamella morphology. Besides, excessive Mn addition changed the chemical composition of Al-Cr-B system and a new phase, doped (Cr1-xMnx)(3)B-4 with well-developed {0 1 0} faces was formed. Overall, a synthesis route of CrB2 crystals with controllable morphology was established. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study proposed the synthesis of a new adsorbent material (GO#Fe2O3/ZnO), through the association of graphene oxide with nanoparticles of oxides of iron and zinc to increase dipyrone adsorption efficiency. The synthesised materials were characterised by TEM and SEM enabling identification of all the materials used in the synthesis in the composition of the new adsorbent. The pseudo-second-order model was the one that best represented the kinetics of dipyrone adsorption on GO#Fe2O3/ZnO, while the Langmuir model presented better adjustment for adsorption isotherms, with a maximum capacity of 116.442 mg g(-1) at 318 K after 360 min of adsorption. The results indicated that the adsorption of dipyrone on GO#Fe2O3/ZnO was spontaneous above 298 K and endothermic according the thermodynamic parameters. The proposed adsorbent showed high efficiency, reaching 76% removal. Also, a interaction mechanism was proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic P(VDF-TrFE) 70/30 copolymer thin films were fabricated on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si(1 1 1) and ITO/glass substrates at 140 degrees C using a spin coater. Both P(VDF-TrFE) thin films exhibited ferroelectric /beta-phase crystallinity, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The polarization-electric hysteresis loops of the P (VDF-TrFE) thin films on the Pt and indium-tin-oxide substrates showed high remnant polarizations of 15.5 and 11.8 mu C/cm(2), respectively. Atomic force microscopy characterization showed rod-like features of the P(VDF-TrFE) thin films on both substrates, where larger rod diameters were observed on the Pt substrate compared to those fabricated on the ITO substrate. Piezoelectric force microscopy measurements further confirmed the superior piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of the P(VDF-TrFE) thin films on the Pt substrate compared to those on the ITO substrate, which arose from the increased diameter of the rod-like features.

AB The variation in plastic deformation of Fe-6.5 wt%Si alloy depends on antiphase domains and grain boundary character distribution. With the increase of rolling reductions from 50% to 85%, the increment of dislocation density causes decline of the sizes of antiphase domains, meanwhile the sharp and homogeneous distribution of gamma-fiber texture is prone to obtaining a large fraction of CSL boundaries, thus the fracture deflection of 65% warm-rolled sheet is increased to 8.6 mm by 38.7% in comparison to that of 50% warm-rolled sheet (6.2 mm), and that of 85% warm-rolled sheet has nearly three times increment (18.2 mm).

AB Nanocrystalline (NC) materials are expected to exhibit excellent irradiation resistant property because of their high volume fraction of grain boundaries. However, the NC materials are usually suspicious to grain coarsening at elevated temperatures. This strongly restricts their applications as practical irradiation resistant materials which are expected to serve at relatively high temperatures. In this work, the irradiation resistant property of a thermally stable NC Fe-1 at.% Zr alloy was examined. The NC alloy was prepared by ball milling method. The irradiation experiments were carried out in a Helium Ion Microscope by 28.4 keV He+ ions to 1 x 10(17), 2 x 10(17) and 4 x 10(17) ions cm(-2) at room temperature. The microstructures of the specimens were examined in a Transmission electron microscope. No He bubbles were observed in the irradiated NC Fe-1 at.% Zr alloy, whereas high number density of He bubbles were found to appear in the coarse grained Fe-1 at.% Zr alloy. The results indicate that the NC Fe-1 at.% Zr alloy exhibits an excellent irradiation resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effort to enhance the visible-light photoresponse of SnO2 and SnO has been designed by the heterostructure formation of tin oxide. The formation was conducted by controlling the oxidation state of precursor through adjusting the precursor acidity. The result shows that the transformation route as a function of precursor initial pH involve the formation of intermediate phase began by SnO2 to SnO2/ Sn3O4 to SnO/Sn3O4, and finally SnO. The characterization indicated that Sn3O4 played the important role in enhancing the visible light response of both SnO2 and SnO in the heterostructure formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fabrication of conductive polyaniline nanofibers (PAnNFs) and poly(aniline-co-N-phenyl-o-phenylenediamine) nanoflakes [P(An-co-PoPD)] can promote a high surface area which influences rapid ion exchange and hence improved sensitivity in biosensor applications. Here, fabrication of two conductive films of PAnNFs from aniline monomer and a mixture of aniline/N-phenyl-o-phenylenediamine (oPD) monomers through cyclic voltammetry (potentiodynamic electropolymerization) technique was performed. The electrochemical features of aniline monomer generate polyaniline nanofibers compared to aniline with addition of oPD monomer that generate nano-flakes. Electro-fabricated electrodes were characterized by SEM, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). A molecular recognition layer of glucose oxidase within chitosan (GOx:CHI) was applied to the electrode-supported polymer and produced chronoamperometry dose-responses to different glucose molar concentrations with sensitivities that were larger for P(An-co-PoPD) compared to PAnNFs electrode.

AB In this paper, Co-doped ZnO nanoparticle and nanofiber are prepared by electrospinning method. The results show that Co-doped ZnO nanofiber performs bead-like fibrous shape and exhibits ferromagnetic properties. The dielectric loss and magnetic loss properties of Co-doped ZnO nanofiber are much better than those of Co-doped ZnO nanoparticle due to the improvement of dipole polarization, interfacial polarization and shape anisotropy. The absorptivity of Co-doped ZnO nanofiber can reach 70% in the frequency range of 5.3-18 GHz when the coating thickness is 1.5-4.0 mm. It is demonstrated that the bead-like fibrous shape is beneficial to optimize electromagnetic loss and microwave absorption properties of Co-doped ZnO. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID COMBUSTION; MIXTURES; CAPTURE
AB Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium silicate (Ca2SiO4) are widely used fillers for fire retardant to polymer and other materials. In recent years, reducing greenhouse gas has become a key issue for environmental concern. Capturing CO2 gas as a solid form in room temperature and ambient condition is attractive method to reduce the greenhouse gas and uses as a fire retardant, such as CaCO3-SiO2 composite. Calcium carbonate-silica composite (CaCO3-SiO2) has been synthesized by bubbling CO2 gas into an aqueous Ca(OH)(2) medium with NH4OH catalyst. Completely dissolved and transparent Ca(OH)(2) solution was prepared to react Ca(OH)(2), tetraethoxy orthosilicate (TEOS), and CO2. The characteristic FTIR absorption peaks of CaCO3 and SiO2 appeared at 1450, 1100, 875 and 712 cm(-1). Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images show mixed particle sizes with small particles (approximately several hundred nanometers) and large particles (approximately several micrometers). Using completely dissolved Ca(OH)(2) and TEOS with NH4OH catalyst is one of the effective method not only capturing CO2 greenhouse gas and use as fire retardant. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

XRD patterns clearly indicated the coexistence of both BiO2 x and (BiO)(2)CO3 in the composites. The formation of heterojunction was observed by TEM. The BiO2 x-(BiO)(2)CO3 possessed an excellent phenol degrading rate of 95% within 60 min under visible light irradiation. Radical trapping experiments indicated that both h(+), HO center dot and O-2(center dot) are the main active species responsible for the degradations.

ID CHIRAL-SELECTIVE GROWTH; NANOTUBES; CATALYSTS
AB Bumped bamboo carbon nanotubes (carbon nanosprouts) were directly synthesized on calcined stainless steel by chemical vapor deposition. Using a mixture of CO and H-2 as the carbon precursor, dense carbon nanosprouts were formed on the surfaces of stainless-steel wire without external catalyst addition. The air calcination favours the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles with relatively small diameters, catalysing the synthesis of carbon nanosprouts with comparable trunk diameters. Transmission electron microscopy analysis shows that Fe2.5C is the active catalyst phase and catalyst deactivation is caused by graphitic layer encapsulation. The enhanced carbon precipitation of Fe catalyst, promoted by the carbon source dissociation or its synergism with other metal, is responsible for the generation of nanosprouts.

AB Organic P(VDF-TrFE) 70/30 copolymer thin films were prepared on ITO/glass substrates at 110-150 degrees C by spin coating. All the P(VDF-TrFE) thin films exhibited ferroelectric beta-phase crystallinity in X-ray diffraction analysis. The polarization-electric field hysteresis analysis revealed that the P(VDF-TrFE) thin film annealed at 140 degrees C has superior ferroelectric properties with a high remanent polarization of 8.02 mu C/cm(2). From atomic force microscopic characterization, we observed lamellar and needle-like structures in the P(VDF-TrFE) thin film annealed at 140 degrees C. Further, piezoelectric force microscopic measurements confirmed a much higher piezoelectric property of the P(VDF-TrFE) thin film annealed at 140 degrees C than those of the films annealed at other temperatures.

AB Nd0.5Ba0.5Mn0.5Fe0.5O3-delta (NBMF55) adopts a cubic perovskite structure in the temperature range of 25-1000 degrees C in air. The oxygen deficit in NBMF55, equal to 0.14 at room temperature (RT), noticeably increased with temperature due to oxygen release at T > 330 degrees C. The sample exhibits a moderate value of linear thermal expansion coefficient (LTEC), 14.4 x 10(-6) K-1, within 25-800 degrees C. Total conductivity in NBMF55 increased with temperature yielding 25 S/cm at 1000 degrees C in air. The conduction was thermally activated with the activation energy of 0.33 eV suggesting a hopping mechanism. The impedance measurements for a symmetrical cell based on the Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) electrolyte material revealed the area-specific resistance (ASR) of 2.2 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air.

AB The BaCo0.7Nb0.2Ta0.1O3-delta (BCNT) perovskite-type oxide was prepared by the conventional solid phase reaction method as a potential electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction. Its electrochemical properties were characterized. The results indicated that the BCNT oxide sintered at 1100 degrees C for 10 h had formed a single-phase cubic perovskite structure. And the BCNT-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) mixture co-sintered at the same conditions showed good chemical compatibility and stability between BCNT and SDC. The BCNT cathode sintered at 1000 degrees C for 4 h on SDC electrolyte exhibited the lowest the polarization resistance (about 0.0495 Omega.cm(2) at 800 degrees C). Moreover, with a 351 mu m-thick SDC as electrolyte and BCNT as the cathode, maximum power densities of the single cell reached 466.81 and 626.41 mW.cm(2) at 750 and 800 degrees C, respectively, and the corresponding total interface polarization resistance of the cell were 0.0913 Omega.cm(2) and 0.0552 Omega.cm(2). Short-term stability of the cell showed that the cell was quite stable at 750 degrees C for 15 h. This suggested that BCNT was a very promising cathode material for IT-SOFCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present work, the high formability of an AZ31 magnesium alloy containing 0.5 wt% calcium (AZ31-0.5Ca) was explained. The results showed that the intermetallic particles (Mg,Al)(2)Ca formed due to the calcium addition contributed to the weakening of the basal texture during the primary processing. In addition, due to the strengthening effect of these particles on the basal slip, a higher activity of prismatic slip was observed. Both the weak basal texture and high activity of prismatic slip explained the high formability recorded for this alloy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Low-dimensional semiconductor nanomaterials with novel properties hold great promise for potential electronics and photonics applications. Here we report the growth of high quality ultra-thin ZnTe nanosheets by a space-confined physical vapour deposition route. The as-prepared ZnTe nanosheets are well crystallized and exhibit the zinc-blende crystal structure, with lateral dimension up to tens of micrometers and thickness thin to tens of nanometers. P-type conductivity was confirmed by field-effect transistors based on the individual nanosheet. Photodetectors constructed by the high-quality ZnTe nanosheets exhibit high photoresponsivity (453.9 A/W), excellent stability and reliability. These results reveal that such high-quality ZnTe nanosheets are excellent candidates for optoelectronic applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TPC technology is used for the manufacturing of substrates for power applications and it enables simple manufacturing of multilayer structures. These structures usually consist of two copper films separated by a dielectric film which are commonly fired individually. Co-firing of these films can reduce production costs and time. It does not deteriorate electrical parameters. The influence of co-firing of different film combinations on the inner structure, electrical and mechanical parameters and also the changes of these parameters after aging and thermal cycling are described in this paper.

AB The purpose of this research was to develop a green method to synthesise gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with cell suspension cultures of Catharanthus roseus. Reaction mixtures containing cell-free culture filtrate of C. roseus and gold III ions, which was initially pale yellow, turned wine red after 24-h incubation due to Au NP formation. UV-Vis spectra of the reaction mixtures showed a characteristic absorption peak at 546 nm. The biosynthesised NPs were predominantly spherical with 2-20 nm size; their crystalline nature was revealed by X-ray diffraction patterns. FTIR analysis indicated that Au NPs were capped by amide characteristic of plant proteins, which makes them apt for various applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The critical behavior of the two-dimensional three-state antiferromagnetic Potts model with quenched disorder on a triangular lattice is investigated by the Monte Carlo method. Static critical exponents for the susceptibility gamma, the magnetization beta, the specific heat alpha, and the exponent of the correlation radius nu at spin concentrations p=0.90; 0.80; 0.70; 0.65 are calculated on the basis of the finite-size scaling theory. The critical exponents are found to be increasing with a rise in disorder without violating the feasibility of scaling equation 2 beta/nu + gamma/nu = d, while relations gamma/nu and beta/nu remain unchanged. This behavior of the critical exponents we have come to associate with the weak universality of a critical behavior typical for disordered systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thin films of PbS were grown on (0 1 2) LaAlO3 by pulsed laser deposition and the deposition parameters were optimized. Films deposited at 553 K under the in-situ argon pressure of 10(-1) mbar were granular having an average crystallite size of 25 nm with a texturing along (2 0 0) direction. Pb 4f and S 2p levels of PbS reveal Lead in +2 and Sulphur in -2 state and there was no evidence for oxygen contamination. Hall results revealed p-type conductivity with the carrier concentration of about 10(11) cm(-3) and a four-probe conductivity of 2 x 10(-4)Omega(-1)cm(-1) at room temperature. The use of PLD for growing thin films of a non-oxide based material is demonstrated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   classification; Wavelet compression
AB Smart healthcare systems require recording, transmitting and processing large volumes of multimodal medical data generated from different types of sensors and medical devices, which is challenging and may turn some of the remote health monitoring applications impractical. Moving computational intelligence to the network edge is a promising approach for providing efficient and convenient ways for continuous-remote monitoring. Implementing efficient edge-based classification and data reduction techniques are of paramount importance to enable smart healthcare systems with efficient real-time and cost-effective remote monitoring. Thus, we present our vision of leveraging edge computing to monitor, process, and make autonomous decisions for smart health applications. In particular, we present and implement an accurate and lightweight classification mechanism that, leveraging some time-domain features extracted from the vital signs, allows for a reliable seizures detection at the network edge with precise classification accuracy and low computational requirement. We then propose and implement a selective data transfer scheme, which opts for the most convenient way for data transmission depending on the detected patient's conditions. In addition to that, we propose a reliable energy-efficient emergency notification system for epileptic seizure detection, based on conceptual learning and fuzzy classification. Our experimental results assess the performance of the proposed system in terms of data reduction, classification accuracy, battery lifetime, and transmission delay. We show the effectiveness of our system and its ability to outperform conventional remote monitoring systems that ignore data processing at the edge by: (i) achieving 98.3% classification accuracy for seizures detection, (ii) extending battery lifetime by 60%, and (iii) decreasing average transmission delay by 90%.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB In recent years there has been intense work on the analysis of social media to support marketing campaigns. A proper methodology for sentiment analysis is a crucial asset in this regard. However, when monitoring major public events the behaviour or social media users may be strongly biased by punctual actions of the participating characters and the sense of group belonging, which is typically linked to specific geographical areas. In this paper, we present a solution combining a location prediction methodology with an unsupervised technique for sentiment analysis to assess automatically the engagement of social network users in different countries during an event with worldwide impact. As far as the authors know, this is the first time such techniques are jointly considered. We demonstrate that the technique is coherent with the intrinsic disposition of individual users to typical actions of the characters participating in the events, as well as with the sense of group belonging.

AB As intelligent transportation systems are becoming more and more prevalent, the relevance of automatic surveillance systems grows larger. While such systems rely heavily on video signals, other types of signals can be used as well to monitor the security of passengers. The present article proposes an audio-based intelligent system for surveillance in public transportation, investigating the use of some state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods for the automatic detection of screams and shouts. We present test results produced on a database of sounds occurring in subway trains in real working conditions, by classifying sounds into screams, shouts and other categories using different Neural Network architectures. The relevance of these architectures in the analysis of audio signals is analyzed. We report encouraging results, given the difficulty of the task, especially when a high level of surrounding noise is present. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CONSTRAINT; EXPLANATION; FRAMEWORK; TUTORIAL; SYSTEMS
AB We present a multi-attribute decision model and a method for explaining the decisions it recommends based on an argumentative reformulation of the model. Specifically, (i) we define a notion of best (i.e., minimally redundant) decisions amounting to achieving as many goals as possible and exhibiting as few redundant attributes as possible, and (ii) we generate explanations for why a decision is best or better than or as good as another, using a mapping between the given decision model and an argumentation framework, such that best decisions correspond to admissible sets of arguments. Concretely, natural language explanations are generated automatically from dispute trees sanctioning the admissibility of arguments. Throughout, we illustrate the power of our approach within a legal reasoning setting, where best decisions amount to past cases that are most similar to a given new, open case. Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation of our method with legal practitioners, confirming that our method is effective for the choice of most similar past cases and helpful to understand automatically generated recommendations.

AB This work analyses the effects of learning or tiredness on the setup times in a scheduling problem with identical parallel machines. This problem involves setup times that depend on the sequence of jobs with the goal of minimizing the sum of total completion times. Due to the complexity of the problem and the assumption that high-quality solutions of the problem without effects are also high-quality solutions when these effects are considered, we firstly propose a metaheuristic algorithm aimed at finding high-quality and diverse solutions, ignoring the learning/tiredness issues. Then, we study the effects of learning or tiredness on the obtained solutions in a real-world scenario by using a multi-agent simulation approach. The computational experiments carried out demonstrate that the simulation model developed in this work is valid to handle randomness in a practical scenario, allowing to be adapted to different learning or tiredness effects. Furthermore, the computational experiments underscore the fact that the proposal can be used as a decision support tool aimed at estimating the amount of job to be assigned to the available machines on the basis of the operator profile.

ID DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; HEALTH
AB Populational studies of human ageing often generate longitudinal datasets with high dimensionality. In order to discover knowledge in such datasets, the traditional knowledge discovery in database task needs to be adapted. In this article, we present a full knowledge discovery process that was performed on a longitudinal dataset, mentioning the singularities of this process. We investigated the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing's (ELSA's) database, employing both semi-supervised and supervised learning techniques to determine and describe the profiles of individuals annotated with the class labels "short-lived" and "long-lived" who participated in the study. We report on the data preprocessing, the clustering task of finding the best sets of representatives of the profiles of each class, and the use of supervised learning to describe these profiles and perform a longitudinal classification on the dataset to investigate how consistently the unlabelled records would fit into the classes. The results show that several aspects are used to discriminate the individuals between the longevity profiles. Those aspects include economic, social and health-related attributes. The findings have pointed towards a need to further investigate the relationships between the different aspects, especially those related to physical health and wellbeing, and how they affect the lifespan of an individual. Furthermore, our methodology and the adopted procedures can be applied to any other data mining applications for longitudinal studies of ageing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CLASSIFICATION; STABILITY
AB Motivated by the Statistical Learning Theory (SLT), which provides a theoretical framework to ensure when supervised learning algorithms generalize input data, this manuscript relies on the Algorithmic Stability framework to prove learning bounds for the unsupervised concept drift detection on data streams. Based on such proof, we also designed the Plover algorithm to detect drifts using different measure functions, such as Statistical Moments and the Power Spectrum. In this way, the criterion for issuing data changes can also be adapted to better address the target task. From synthetic and real-world scenarios, we observed that each data stream may require a different measure function to identify concept drifts, according to the underlying characteristics of the corresponding application domain. In addition, we discussed about the differences of our approach against others from literature, and showed illustrative results confirming the usefulness of our proposal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Histopathological images are the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis. During examination several dozens of them are acquired for a single patient. Conventional, image-based classification systems make the assumption that all the patient's images have the same label as the patient, which is rarely verified in practice since labeling the data is expensive. We propose a weakly supervised learning framework and investigate the relevance of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer patients, based on the analysis of histopathological images. Multiple instance learning consists in organizing instances (images) into bags (patients), without the need to label all the instances. We compare several state-of-the-art MIL methods including the pioneering ones (APR, Diverse Density, MI-SVM, citation-kNN), and more recent ones such as a non parametric method and a deep learning based approach (MIL-CNN). The experiments are conducted on the public BreaKHis dataset which contains about 8000 microscopic biopsy images of benign and malignant breast tumors, originating from 82 patients. Among the MIL methods the non-parametric approach has the best overall results, and in some cases allows to obtain classification rates never reached by conventional (single instance) classification frameworks. The comparison between MIL and single instance classification reveals the relevance of the MIL paradigm for the task at hand. In particular, the MIL allows to obtain comparable or better results than conventional (single instance) classification without the need to label all the images. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB One-class classification (OCC) is to properly classify unknown data by developing a classifier, which can learn about a given training dataset with only one class. Its importance has been increasing in situations such that (i) there exists little or no information pertaining to other classes, or (ii) there are many unknown and heterogeneous classes. However, many OCC algorithms developed so far have some limitations as (i) they are black-box algorithms so that the user cannot clearly understand the internal classification mechanism of generated models, and (ii) there are no dominant criteria for node branching in decision-tree-based algorithms. Based on these motivations, in this work, we propose two efficient one-class classifiers using hyper-rectangles (h-rtgl) to describe a dataset with only one class: one-class hyper-rectangle descriptor by merging and one-class hyper-rectangle descriptor by partitioning, depending on the methods generating intervals and h-rtgls. The suggested classifiers can control the number and volume of the generated h-rtgls, which can affect the classification accuracy and deal with overfitting issue. We show the superiority of the proposed classifiers by a numerical experiment using UCI machine learning repository. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study trading systems using reinforcement learning with three newly proposed methods to maximize total profits and reflect real financial market situations while overcoming the limitations of financial data. First, we propose a trading system that can predict the number of shares to trade. Specifically, we design an automated system that predicts the number of shares by adding a deep neural network (DNN) regressor to a deep Q-network, thereby combining reinforcement learning and a DNN. Second, we study various action strategies that use Q-values to analyze which action strategies are beneficial for profits in a confused market. Finally, we propose transfer learning approaches to prevent overfitting from insufficient financial data. We use four different stock indices-the S&P500, KOSPI, HSI, and EuroStoxx50-to experimentally verify our proposed methods and then conduct extensive research. The proposed automated trading system, which enables us to predict the number of shares with the DNN regressor, increases total profits by four times in S&P500, five times in KOSPI, 12 times in HSI, and six times in EuroStoxx50 compared with the fixed-number trading system. When the market situation is confused, delaying the decision to buy or sell increases total profits by 18% in S&P500, 24% in KOSPI, and 49% in EuroStoxx50. Further, transfer learning increases total profits by twofold in S&P500, 3 times in KOSPI, twofold in HSI, and 2.5 times in EuroStoxx50. The trading system with all three proposed methods increases total profits by 13 times in S&P500, 24 times in KOSPI, 30 times in HSI, and 18 times in EuroStoxx50, outperforming the market and the reinforcement learning model.

AB Sentiment analysis is a fast growing area of research in natural language processing (NLP) and text classifications. This technique has become an essential part of a wide range of applications including politics, business, advertising and marketing. There are various techniques for sentiment analysis, but recently word embeddings methods have been widely used in sentiment classification tasks. Word2Vec and GloVe are currently among the most accurate and usable word embedding methods which can convert words into meaningful vectors. However, these methods ignore sentiment information of texts and need a large corpus of texts for training and generating exact vectors. As a result, because of the small size of some corpora, researcher often have to use pre-trained word embeddings which were trained on other large text corpora such as Google News with about 100 billion words. The increasing accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings has a great impact on sentiment analysis research. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Improved Word Vectors (IWV), which increases the accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings in sentiment analysis. Our method is based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging techniques, lexicon-based approaches, word position algorithm and Word2Vec/GloVe methods. We tested the accuracy of our method via different deep learning models and benchmark sentiment datasets. Our experiment results show that Improved Word Vectors (IWV) are very effective for sentiment analysis. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Computational optimization algorithms are focused on the improvement of meta-heuristic algorithms in a way that they can able to handle problems with more than one objective; such improved algorithms are called multiobjective optimization algorithms. As the number of objectives is increased, the complexity of the algorithm is increased with respect to the computational cost. Because classical optimization algorithms follow the direction of descending values by calculating derivations of the function, it is possible to evaluate a classical optimization algorithm as the core of a novel multiobjective optimization algorithm. Among the classical optimization algorithms, in this study, the Hooke-Jeeves (HJ) algorithm is selected as the basis of the proposed multiobjective optimization algorithm, in which members of the proposed population-based HJ algorithm move to the Pareto front by checking two neighborhood solutions at each dimension, with a dynamic distance that is calculated by using the Newton-Raphson-like stochastic step-size method. Unlike various multiobjective optimization algorithms, the performance of the proposed algorithm is greatly dependent on the decision space dimension instead of the number of objectives. As the number of objectives increases without changing the decision dimension, the computational cost almost remains the same. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be applied to single, multiple and many objective optimization problems. In this study, initially, the behaviors of the HJ and proposed multiobjective HJ algorithms are evaluated by theoretical and graphical demonstrations. Next, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on well-known benchmark problems, and the performance of this algorithm is compared with the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) algorithm by using three different metric calculations. Finally, the algorithm is applied to many-objective optimization problems, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated based on the obtained results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Multilevel thresholding of images helps in separating the interesting objects from their background. The quality of separation depends much on the selected threshold values. This paper proposes a novel thresholding (TH) heuristic for multilevel thresholding problem. Further, the proposed TH heuristic is embedded into whale optimization algorithm (WOA), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to develop new algorithms named WOA-TH, GWO-TH, and PSO-TH respectively. The TH heuristic fine-tunes the best solution of employer nature-inspired algorithms for increasing their capability to escape local optimum. To find the optimum thresholds for an image, between-class variance criterion is employed as the fitness function. Experiments have been performed on twenty benchmark test images using six different number of thresholds. The performance of the proposed algorithms is compared with their respective base algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed WOA-TH, GWO-TH, and PSO-TH algorithms are superior to the compared algorithms. Moreover, the computational time of WOA, GWO, and PSO is improved through the incorporation of proposed heuristic. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Blockchains have attracted worldwide attention in recent years. With the increasing number of public blockchains, the evaluation of public blockchains becomes meaningful. This paper aims to make a comprehensive evaluation of public blockchains from multiple dimensions. Three first-level indicators and eleven second-level indicators are designed to evaluate the public blockchains. The technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used to rank public blockchains. The entropy method is used to calculate the weights of different indicators objectively. Since Bitcoin has an absolute advantage, a let-the-first-out (LFO) strategy is proposed to reduce the criteria of the positive ideal solution and make a more reasonable evaluation. The evaluation indicators and the ranking results of public blockchains can provide related researchers and managers with references and support their decisions. The three first-level indicators are technology, recognition, and activity. Their weights are 16.80%, 59.00%, and 24.20% respectively. The evaluation result shows that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EOS are ranked in the top three public blockchains. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the recent development of computational intelligence (CI), data-driven models have gained growing interest to be applied in various scientific disciplines. This paper aims at proposing a hybrid Cl-based data-driven framework as a complement for the physics-based models used in climatological prediction. The proposed framework, called FB-STEP, is based on a combination of fuzzy Bayesian strategy and multifractal analysis technique. The focus is to address three major research challenges in multivariate climatological prediction: (1) modeling complex spatio-temporal dependency among climatological variables, (2) dealing with non-linear, chaotic dynamics in climatic time series, and (3) reducing epistemic uncertainty in the data-driven prediction process. The present work not only explores Fuzzy-Bayesian modeling of spatio-temporal processes, but also presents an elegant approach of dealing with intrinsic chaos in time series, through a synergism between multifractal analysis and Bayesian inference mechanism. Similar concepts may also be successfully employed in developing expert or intelligent systems for wide range of applications, including reservoir-water dynamics modeling, flood monitoring, traffic flow modeling, chemical-mechanical process monitoring, and so on. Thus, the present research work carries a significant value not merely in the field of climate research, but also in the domains of Al and machine intelligence. The experimentation has been carried out to spatio-temporally extrapolate the climatic conditions of five different locations in India, with the help of historical data on temperature, humidity, precipitation rate, and soil moisture. A comparative study with popular linear and non-linear methods has validated the efficacy of the proposed data-driven approach for climatological prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study presents financial network indicators that can be applied to global stock market investment strategies. We propose to design both undirected and directed volatility networks of global stock market based on simple pair-wise correlation and system-wide connectedness of national stock indices using a vector auto-regressive model. We examine the effect and usefulness of network indicators by applying them as inputs for determining strategies via several machine learning approaches (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest). Two strategies are constructed considering stock price indices: (1) global stock market prediction strategy and (2) regional allocation strategy for developed market/emerging market. According to the results of the performance analysis, network indicators were proven to be important supplementary indicators in predicting global stock market and regional relative directions (up/down). In particular, these indicators were more effective during market crisis periods. This study is the first attempt to construct strategies for global portfolio management using financial network indicators and to suggest how network indicators can be used in practical fields.

AB Cluster analysis has a wide application in many areas, including pattern recognition, information retrieval, and image processing. In most real-world clustering problems, the number of clusters must be predetermined. Automatic clustering is a promising solution for this challenge which automatically determines the number and structure of clusters in data. In recent years, the evolutionary algorithm due to their search mechanisms has been popular in solving automatic clustering problems. Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is a successful evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, for the first time, Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is used for solving automatic clustering problems, called "the automatic clustering using ICA (AC-ICA)". In the proposed algorithm, in order to increase the exploration ability, the movement of colonies toward the imperialist was changed at the assimilation step. A new method has been provided for changing the number of clusters by combining random and homogeneity based merge-split approach. Furthermore, an efficient method based on density has been proposed for reinitializing empty cluster centers. To use AC-ICA in automatic clustering, the initialization and imperialist competition steps were changed. Based on changes in these two steps, a framework was provided for changing different types of ICA to solve automatic clustering problems. Then, the basic ICA and its three recently developed types, were changed by this framework and their performances in automatic clustering were compared to AC-ICA. The examinations were done on six synthetic and ten real word data sets. The comparison of the proposed algorithm's results with basic ICA, its three recently developed types and several state-of-art automatic clustering methods, shows AC-ICA's superiority in terms of the speed of convergence to the optimal solution and quality of the obtained solution. We also applied our algorithm to a real world application (i.e., face recognition) and the achieved results were acceptable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Feature Selection (FS) is a challenging machine learning-related task that aims at reducing the number of features by removing irrelevant, redundant and noisy data while maintaining an acceptable level of classification accuracy. FS can be considered as an optimisation problem. Due to the difficulty of this problem and having a large number of local solutions, stochastic optimisation algorithms are promising techniques to solve this problem. As a seminal attempt, binary variants of the recent Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (GOA) are proposed in this work and employed to select the optimal feature subset for classification purposes within a wrapper-based framework. Two mechanisms are employed to design a binary GOA, the first one is based on Sigmoid and V-shaped transfer functions, and will be indicated by BGOA-S and BGOA-V, respectively. While the second mechanism uses a novel technique that combines the best solution obtained so far. In addition, a mutation operator is employed to enhance the exploration phase in BGOA algorithm (BGOA-M). The proposed methods are evaluated using 25 standard UCI datasets and compared with 8 well-regarded metaheuristic wrapper-based approaches, and six well known filter-based (e.g., correlation FS) approaches. The comparative results show the superior performance of the BGOA and BGOA-M methods compared to other similar techniques in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Deep learning; Business failure; Financial statement; Imaging
AB Convolutional neural networks are being applied to identification problems in a variety of fields, and in some areas are showing higher discrimination accuracies than conventional methods. However, applications of convolutional neural networks to financial analyses have only been reported in a small number of studies on the prediction of stock price movements. The reason for this seems to be that convolutional neural networks are more suitable for application to images and less suitable for general numerical data including financial statements. Hence, in this research, an attempt is made to apply a convolutional neural network to the prediction of corporate bankruptcy, which in most cases is treated as a two-class classification problem. We use the financial statements (balance sheets and profit-and-loss statements) of 102 companies that have been delisted from the Japanese stock market due to de facto bankruptcy as well as the financial statements of 2062 currently listed companies over four financial periods. In our proposed method, a set of financial ratios are derived from the financial statements and represented as a grayscale image. The image generated by this process is utilized for training and testing a convolutional neural network. Moreover, the size of the dataset is increased using the weighted averages to create synthetic data points. A total of 7520 images for the bankrupt and continuing enterprises classes are used for training the convolutional neural network based on GoogLeNet. Bankruptcy predictions through the trained network are shown to have a higher performance compared to methods using decision trees, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, multi-layer perceptron, AdaBoost, or Altman's Z ''-score.

TI A Structure-Enriched Neural Network for network embedding

DE Network embedding; Direction adjustment; Attention mechanism
ID DIMENSIONALITY
AB Recent years have witnessed the importance of network embedding in many fields, as well as increased attention in academia. Although a number of algorithms have been proposed in this area, most existing models which only utilize the structure topology information of networks often suffer performance losses because of their insufficiency with regard to selecting structure similar patterns, handling noise data, and/or capturing non-linear or high-order structure information. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel Structure-Enriched Neural Network (SENN) for network embedding. Specifically, SENN can not only capture the complex structure similar patterns observed in networks by introducing direction adjustment parameters of the transition probability, but also introduce a stacked denoise autoencoder to perform the dimension reduction for each order matrix independently. Therefore, SENN can preserve more useful structure information and make the embeddings more robust. Moreover, SENN can effectively integrate the multi-order structure information by the combining layer with attention mechanism. Finally, to compare with other state-of-the-art methods, we conduct extensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets on various tasks (e.g.,node classification, visualization). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model for network embedding. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Developing effective approaches to design optimal resources of system based on the concepts of benchmark in DEA and optimal design in De-Novo programming is one of the important managerial decision making problems. In this paper, a decision support system is developed for allocation of resources and setting the targets across a set of entities in an equitable manner in presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach has two main modules. First, the most suitable system is designed using De-Novo programming. De-Novo programming. De-Novo programming is used to optimally determine the inputs (i.e., resources) and outputs (i.e., targets) of DMUs in network DEA rather than optimizing existing DMUs. Then, the optimal values of resources are allocated and optimal values of the targets are set in a complex network structure. Furthermore, in real-world problems budget of resources and targets are usually mixed with uncertainties, so in this paper, two concept of fuzzy and interval type-II fuzzy resources and target are developed for resource allocation and target setting. Finally numerical example based on real case of natural gas supply chain is also used to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern organizations typically regard information and communication technologies (ICTs) as one of the significant direct or indirect inputs for achieving operational excellence and competitive advantage. Since the concept of competitive advantage involves a relative comparison of the performance of organizational entities, then the concepts of organizational capabilities, context, and benchmarking are relevant. In this paper we present a new multi-method methodology for benchmarking that explicitly takes into consideration context-specific factors impacting the performance of organizational entities. This novel methodology allows for obtaining actionable information, in the form of non-obvious common causal structures, for improving the performance of the less efficient entities vis-a-vis their more efficient counterparts. The new methodology is state-of-the-art and is novel because it explicitly takes into consideration the context within which the organizational entities perform. Such "context awareness" allows for expanding the universe of discourse within which the process improvement initiatives are usually considered, thus allowing to consider the impact of external to the process factors on internal to the process mechanisms. This methodology involves the creative integration of several Information Systems (IS)' artifacts (i.e. multiple data mining methods) with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). We present an illustrative application of this methodology to an IS/ICT & Productivity research problem in the 'developing' countries context. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the rapid growth of the Internet, users change their preference from traditional shopping to the electronic commerce. Instead of bank/shop robbery, nowadays, criminals try to find their victims in the cyberspace with some specific tricks. By using the anonymous structure of the Internet, attackers set out new techniques, such as phishing, to deceive victims with the use of false websites to collect their sensitive information such as account IDs, usernames, passwords, etc. Understanding whether a web page is legitimate or phishing is a very challenging problem, due to its semantics-based attack structure, which mainly exploits the computer users' vulnerabilities. Although software companies launch new anti-phishing products, which use blacklists, heuristics, visual and machine learning-based approaches, these products cannot prevent all of the phishing attacks. In this paper, a real-time anti-phishing system, which uses seven different classification algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) based features, is proposed. The system has the following distinguishing properties from other studies in the literature: language independence, use of a huge size of phishing and legitimate data, real-time execution, detection of new websites, independence from third-party services and use of feature-rich classifiers. For measuring the performance of the system, a new dataset is constructed, and the experimental results are tested on it. According to the experimental and comparative results from the implemented classification algorithms, Random Forest algorithm with only NLP based features gives the best performance with the 97.98% accuracy rate for detection of phishing URLs.

AB In the last few years, several articles have proposed decision trees (DTs) as an alternative to computerized adapted tests (CATs). These works have focused on showing the differences between the two methods with the aim of identifying the advantages of each of them and thus determining when it is preferable to use one method or another. In this article, Tree-CAT, a new technique for building CATs is presented. Unlike the existing work, Tree-CAT exploits the similarities between CATs and DTs. This technique allows the creation of CATs that minimise the mean square error in the estimation of the examinee's ability level, and controls the item's exposure rate. The decision tree is sequentially built by means of an innovative algorithmic procedure that selects the items associated with each of the tree branches by solving a linear program. In addition, our work presents further advantages over alternative item selection techniques with exposure control, such as instant item selection or simultaneous administration of the test to an unlimited number of participants. These advantages allow accurate on-line CATs to be implemented even when the item selection method is computationally costly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the effects of the intracellular constituents of yeast microcarriers on the thermal and oxidative stability of encapsulated curcumin. Intact yeast cells and plasmolyzed yeast, i.e. yeast cell wall particles (YCWPs), of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared to Pickering emulsions in this study. Peroxyl radicals were generated with 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and thermal pasteurization was carried out at 70 degrees C and 90 degrees C. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and kinetic modeling were also employed. YWCPs provided significantly higher thermal stability to curcumin (91.8 +/- 1.0% and 99.7 +/- 3.1% at 70 degrees C and 90 degrees C respectively) compared to intact cells and Pickering emulsions; these results in YCWPs were attributed to the lack of native subcellular structures which are prone to denaturation and subsequently release curcumin. Native yeast, however, provided significantly higher oxidative stability to encapsulated curcumin. This oxidative stability in intact cells was ascribed to endogenous, cytoplasmic antioxidants and confirmed with ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays.

AB The effects of microwave treatment (MT), heat-moisture treatment (HMT) and autoclaving treatment (GT) on the structural and physicochemical characteristics of lycoris starch (LS) were investigated. The HMT-LS and GT-LS particles were larger and rougher with block-like characteristics compared to the LS particles. The XRD results revealed that HMT and GT converted native starch (A-type) into B-type starch. The density of the starch crystallization zone after HMT and GT was higher than that of LS, while MT had the weakest effect. The solubility and swelling power of MT-LS, HMT-LS and GT-LS were significantly (p < 0.05) lower at 65 and 95 degrees C, but opposite trends were observed at 55 degrees C. The RVA viscograms for MT-LS, HMT-LS, and GT-LS showed a lower breakdown and setback value compared to that of LS, reflecting stronger starch aggregations and lower retrogradation tendencies. Additionally, both G' and G '' of the treated starch were lower, which indicated weaker gel structures.

AB This study investigated the volatile phytochemical diversity of 30 samples obtained from experimental hybrid and commercial H. lupulus L. plants. Essential oils distilled from these samples were analysed by high resolution gas chromatography coupled with accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-accTOFMS). A total of 58 secondary metabolites, mainly comprising 18 esters, 6 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 2 oxygenated monoterpenes, 20 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 7 oxygenated sesquiterpenes, and 4 ketones, were positively or tentatively identified. A total of 24 metabolites were detected in all samples, but commercial cultivars (selected for brewing performance) had fewer compounds identified compared to experimental genotypes. Chemometrics analyses enabled distinct differentiation of experimental hybrids from commercial cultivars, discussed in terms of the different classes of compounds present in different genotypes. Differences among the mono- and sesquiterpenoids, appear to be related to either: i) the genetic origin of the plants; or ii) the processes of bioaccumulation of the identified secondary metabolites.

AB The inhibitory activity of soluble and insoluble starch (0-550 ppm/Brix) in factory raw sugars were investigated using simulated refinery carbonatation clarification reactions to underpin what causes the undesirable formation of CaCO3 crystal fines (<= 5 mu m). It was found that CaCO3 crystal growth was inhibited mostly by soluble starch by forming starch-Ca2+ metal complexes. Insoluble (granular) starch, however, had a greater affinity for inhibiting CaCO3 crystallization because it retained the carbonatation clarification reactants, i.e., Ca2+ and OH-, in the granule interior which caused granule gelatinization and increased viscosity of the melt liquor. Causes for poor press filterability and CaCO3 fines using raw sugar melts were found to be complex and attributed to the combinatorial roles that both soluble and insoluble starch have, among other impurities. More studies are now warranted at the carbonatation refinery to correlate processing characteristics with raw sugars quality attributes to underpin how each impurity impedes carbonatation.

AB A rapid headspace solid-phase microextraction method was optimized to detect volatile components in three commercial plain sufu samples. The method was then used to qualify 14 aroma impact components that contribute significantly to the volatile profile in 12 commercial samples produced at three locations and laboratoryscale fermented samples aged for 3, 15, 30, and 90 days. Principal component analysis (PCA) was subsequently used to group the samples. The optimized method identified 148 volatile compounds in three commercial samples, and the concentrations of 14 aroma impact compounds varied significantly among commercial and laboratory samples. PCA confirmed that these samples could be discriminated according to their production location and aging time, thereby rendering this method a simple strategy for sample discrimination.

AB The antioxidant capacities of Kyoho skin, seed, and flesh extracts were determined using DPPH center dot and ABTS(center dot) assays and a suitable statistical program was tested for the prediction of EC50 values of Kyoho skin, seed, and flesh extracts obtained by DPPH center dot and ABTS(center dot) assays. Statistical programs: OriginPro (R) version 8, GraphPad Prism (R) version 7, GraphPad Prism (R) version 7 five-parameter (5P) logistic model, SigmaPlot (R) version 14.0, Microsoft Excel (R) version 2016, interpolation log, and direct interpolation methods were employed to estimate the EC50 values. Linear regression and direct interpolation results showed deviations for non-linear models in the prediction of EC50 values of grape extracts. The correlation results of grape flesh extracts demonstrated a positive correlation (r = >= 0.95) between EC50 values of antioxidant assays. Therefore, non-linear methods were appropriate for EC50 calculations. These findings have significant implications for selecting an efficient statistical tool to calculate EC50 values for DPPH center dot and ABTS(center dot) assays.

Antiproliferative activity against Caco-2 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines (tumour cell lines of intestinal and mammary origin, respectively) was investigated, as well as alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibition, antihypertensive, antioxidant and proteolytic activities. ABTS antioxidant activities of fermented lupin (FL, 55% w/v), quinoa (FQ, 55% w/v) and wheat (FW, 55% w/v) ranged from similar to 12.0% to 55.0%,similar to 17.6% to 73.0%, and similar to 29.0% to 26.0%, respectively. Lupin, quinoa and wheat fermented by L. plantarum had pronounced antihypertensive activities (similar to 85%). The alpha-glucosidase inhibition in FL was higher than that of FQ and FW.

AB The aim of the present study was to compare the different bioactivities of milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) proteins between yak and cow, and identified the differential MFGM proteins. In this study, 156 differential MFGM proteins between yak and cow were identified with various health-related bioactivities including antiadhesion of bacteria and viruses, glucose and lipid metabolism, immunoregulation, antioxidant activity, anticancer and neural regulation by GOBP and KEGG pathway analysis. The efficacy of differential MFGM proteins from cow and yak milk on glucose and lipid metabolism was verified by in vitro HepG2 cells. MFGM proteins of yak exhibited significantly higher lipid accumulation-lowering efficacy, and MFGM proteins of cow had significantly higher efficacy of increasing glucose uptake. The differential types and amount MFGM proteins of yak and cow milk that might relate to the different effect on glucose and lipid metabolism were also identified. These findings demonstrate that MFGM proteins contain potential bioactive ingredients for improving metabolic health.

AB Seeds and sprouts are of considerable interest due to their numerous pro-health benefits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of germination on the mineral composition (performed by flame absorption atomic spectroscopy), total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, as well as phenolic profiles (before and after alkaline hydrolysis by high-performance liquid chromatography) of chia, golden flax, evening primrose, phacelia and fenugreek seeds. Generally, significant (p < 0.05) changes in the individual minerals composition of the seeds, improvement of their antioxidant properties, as well as increase in levels of individual phenolic compounds was found after seeds germination. Alkaline hydrolysis allowed to release free forms of phenolics and to confirm (chromatographically) their significantly higher amounts when compared to the nonhydrolyzed fraction. Gallic, protocatechuic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic and sinapic acids, as well as quercetin and kaempferol were identified in analyzed seeds and sprouts. Sprouts exhibited better nutritional values than their un-germinated forms.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the dual effect of the nitric oxide donor NOR-3 and calpastatin on mu-calpain activity, autolysis, and proteolytic ability. mu-Calpain and calpastatin were purified and allocated to the following five treatments: mu-calpain, mu-calpain + calpastatin, mu-calpain + NOR-3, mu-calpain + calpastatin + NOR-3, and mu-calpain + NOR-3 + calpastatin. mu-Calpain autolysis and the activity against purified myofibrils was initiated by addition of calcium. Results showed that NOR-3 could induce mu-calpain S-nitrosylation and effectively block the activity via the inhibition of mu-calpain autolysis. Calpastatin inhibited mu-calpain activity in a dose-dependent manner. The combined treatment of NOR-3 and calpastatin exerted a further inhibitory effect on mu-calpain activity, autolysis and proteolysis which was affected by the addition order of NOR-3 and calpastatin. Our data suggest that S-nitrosylation may play a regulatory role in mediating mu-calpain activity in the presence of calpastatin.

AB Antioxidant constituents such as carotenoids (capsanthin, phytoene, lutein, 13-cryptoxanthin), polyphenols content (p-coumaric, ferulic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic acid, sinapic acid, and quercetin-3-glucoside) and marketable yield were investigated in 11 sweet pepper cultivars grown under controlled temperature plastic tunnel and white shade net. Marketable yield was not affected by either of the environments, while the interaction between cultivar and growing environment significantly affected the accumulation of antioxidant constituents. The principal component analysis illustrated that controlled temperature plastic tunnel improved the accumulation of carotenoid components and ascorbic acid and vitamin C content in most cultivars. On the contrary, white shade nets favoured the accumulation of phenolic compounds and ORAC activity in most cultivars. A strong correlation was noted between phytoene and carotenoid components in this study (capsanthin r = 0.60; P < 0.001; lutein r = 0.75; P < 0.001; beta-carotene r = 0.78; P < 0.001) while ORAC correlated with phenolic compounds. Based on this study, it is possible to refine the choice of environment and cultivar to enhance individual antioxidant constituent groups to improve health benefits for consumers.

AB This study reports on removal of acrylamide from roasted coffee by acrylamidase from Cupriavidus oxalaticus ICTDB921. Chitosan coated calcium alginate beads were functionalized with citric acid as nontoxic cross linker and activated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydro-xysuccinimide (NHS) (1.66:1 w/w) for covalent immobilization of acrylamidase. The optimum beads were obtained using 5% sodium alginate, 1.5% chitosan, and 0.6 mol/L citric acid. The beads prepared at each step were characterized by FTIR and SEM. Coating of chitosan matrix on calcium alginate beads enhanced the mechanical stability over that of calcium alginate and/or chitosan. The immobilized acrylamidase showed optimum pH/temperature of 8.5/65 degrees C, improved pH/thermal/shelf stability, and retained 80% activity after four cycles. Haldane model could describe the degradation kinetics of acrylamide in batch study. In packed bed column, a bed height, feed flow rate and inlet acrylamide concentration of 20 cm, 1 mL/min, and 100 mg/L gave best results.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the effect of postmortem ageing on quality attributes of frozen/thawed lamb loins. The loins (M. Longissimus dorsi; n = 30) were randomly divided into six groups: five frozen treatment groups and the control (4 degrees C for 120 h). Treatment groups were frozen for 3 weeks and thawed at 4 degrees C overnight, muscles were preserved at 4 degrees C until 120 h. Compared to the control, pH values and color of frozen meat declined (P < 0.05) after ageing for 72 h, lower shear force values and higher water loss with earlier freezing were due to extensive degradation of myofibril protein. These results indicated the loins frozen in earlier period could accelerate ageing rate, but impaired meat quality inevitably, freezing between 12 h and 24 h postmortem was a better consideration.

AB Encapsulation of clove essential oil (CEO) by chitosan nanoparticles (ChNPs) was performed, using an emulsionionic gelation technique to improve the antifungal efficacy of CEO. The mass ratios of chitosan (Ch) to tripolyphosphate (TPP), 1:1, for unloaded ChNPs and 1:1:1 for Ch to TPP to CEO, for CEO-loaded ChNPs (CEOChNPs), were selected as optimum formulations based on dynamic light scattering and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The presence of CEO in optimum CEO-ChNPs, was evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Particle size distribution, of around 40 and 100 nm for the most optimum unloaded and oil-loaded ChNPs, was obtained by field emission-scanning electron microscopy. In vitro release studies of CEO-ChNPs revealed a controlled release during 56 days. The nano-encapsulated CEO demonstrated a superior performance against Aspergillus niger, isolated from spoiled pomegranate, compared with ChNPs and free oil. Therefore, this study revealed that CEO-ChNPs can be used as a promising natural fungicide in agriculture and food industry.

AB We formulated and characterised two alginate blends for the encapsulation of stevia extract (SE) via ionic gelation through an extrusion technique. Calcium chloride in SE and calcium chloride solutions were assessed as crosslinkers to overcome phenolic losses by diffusion and increase encapsulation efficiency (EE). Regardless of the blend, all stevia-loaded beads exhibited high EE (62.7-101.0%). The size of the beads decreased as EE increased. Fourier transform infrared analysis showed increased hydrogen bonding between SE and alginates, confirming the successful incorporation of SE within the matrix. Untargeted metabolomics profiling identified 479 free and encapsulated polyphenolic compounds. Flavonoids (catechin and luteolin equivalents) were predominant in SE whereas tyrosols and 5-pentadecylresorcinol equivalents were predominant in all bead formulations. Three-common discriminant compounds were exclusive to each blend and were inversely affected by the crosslinking conditions. Both alginate blends have been shown to be feasible as carrier systems of stevia extracts independent of crosslinking conditions.

AB The physiological efficacy of nutraceuticals is dependent on their physicochemical nature and bioavailability across biological barriers. In the present work, effects of nano-sizing of emulsion-based delivery vehicle on the bioavailability of polyunsaturated fatty acids rich fish oil have been investigated via three-step experimental design; ex vivo rat everted intestinal sac model, cellular lipid uptake and the bioactivity in rat PBMCs. Nanoemulsion in comparison to the conventional emulsion has shown significant higher rate of uptake of polyunsaturated fatty acids in three segments of small intestine. The time-kinetics of such uptake was correlated with appearance of short-chain fatty acids in basal side of the everted sac. The bioavailability of the formulated fish oil and its inhibitory response against lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production in rat PBMCs were positively correlated. This formulation with nano-sized droplets can be utilized as smart delivery vehicles for designing oral therapies in future.

AB The ester aroma profiles of five Chinese cherry wines and the perceptual interaction among esters were investigated in this study. 24 esters were identified by Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-0) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). According to addition/omission analysis, seven volatile compounds among them were selected and studied using sensory profiling and multivariate statistic methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In sensory analysis, a significant reduction of olfactory threshold for total aromatic reconstitution was induced by the addition among each of them in Feller's additive model, which demonstrated their synergistic effects. The GA plot showed that most of them were followed by a partial addition behavior. Furthermore, PCA indicated that the addition among each of them had a significant effect on fruity, floral, sweet and fermentation aroma intensity. Specifically, ethyl decanoate and methyl salicylate at subthreshold concentrations were also likely to contribute to overall aroma. The results of perceptual interaction were mainly influenced by chemical structure and molecular polarity.

AB Magnetic nanoparticles were modified by plasma polymerization, using allylamine, acrylic acid and 2-methyl-2-oxazoline as precursor to produce amine, carboxyl and oxazoline functional group rich surfaces. The nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and zeta potential measurements. The capacity of nanoparticles carrying different surface properties to remove haze-forming proteins from Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc unfined wines was examined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The protein capture efficiency of the modified surfaces decreases in the following order: COOH > POx > NH2. This study will help optimising the design of this new technology for the selective removal of haze proteins from white wines.

AB The oxidation of eugenol, isoeugenol and vanillin natural antioxidants catalyzed by the soybean peroxidase enzyme was studied using uv-vis spectroscopy. An experimental design was used to optimize the different variables. The multivariate curve resolution method was used to obtain the profiles of antioxidant absorbance's as a function of time due to uv-vis absorption bands of both antioxidants and the enzymatic reaction product/s show a strong overlap. From these results, apparent Michaelis-Menten constants as well as the kinetic parameters k(1) and k(3) involved in the catalytic cycle of peroxidases were calculated. The antioxidant apparent acidity constants were also determined at different pH's from uv-vis spectrophotometric measurements. Values of k(1) were (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10(5)M(-1)s(-1), (2.0 +/- 0.2) x 10(5)M(-1)s(-1) and (7.0 +/- 0.5) x 10(6)M(-1)s(-1) and k(3) (4.0 +/- 0.2) x 10(5)M(-1)s(-1), (6.0 +/- 0.6) x 10(5)M(-1)s(-1 )and (6.0 +/- 0.9) x 10(6)M(-1)s(-1) for eugenol, isoeugenol and vanillin, respectively.

AB We developed an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectral method to determine the fungicide carboxin and its metabolites, oxycarboxin and carboxin sulfoxide in peanut samples. The method was used to detect the concentration of the analyzes in the samples from fields and markets. The total residue quantities in peanut kernels were used to evaluate the chronic dietary risk of total carboxin upon peanut consumption. The estimated dietary intake of carboxin from peanuts whose seeds had been treated with carboxin at the recommended dose was between 0.020% and 0.344% of acceptable daily intake and the risk was found to be negligible. The chronic dietary risk assessment from markets and commercial field samples for various groups of humans indicated that the group with the greatest degree of exposure was 45 to 75-year-old women who lived in rural areas. However, their acceptable daily intake percentage was 0.006%, meaning that their health risk was extremely small.

AB Recent works provide evidence of the prebiotic potential of arabinoxylan-derived oligosaccharides (A)XOS. In this study, we developed a structural analysis for cereal-derived (A)XOS by negative ionization HILIC-MS/MS. Initially, we assessed twelve (A)XOS samples of known structures with different linkage positions and branching points by direct-infusion negative ESI-MSn. We subsequently developed the negative ion HILIC-MS/MS with a post-column addition of ammonium chloride. The selected (A)XOS represented both linear (arabinofuranosyl residue linked to the non-reducing end of xylooligosaccharide) and branched structures. Each (A)XOS sample produced a specific spectrum in negative ion ESI-MSn. By analyzing cross-ring fragment ions, we determined the linkage positions of linear (A)XOS. The presence or absence of diagnostic ions in the MS3 allowed us to detect different branches (O-2- or/and O-3-linked arabinofuranosyl with/or without O-4-linked xylopyranosyl at the non-reducing end). Furthermore, we could identify all analyzed samples by HILIC-MS/MS, based on the formed spectral library and chromatographic retention times.

AB In this paper, for the first time the binding behavior of cadmium (Cd2+) to rice proteins (RPs) was studied. The results showed that the equilibrium of binding was reached within 30 min at 303 K with a maximum binding amount (q) of 15.26 mg/g, and the pH was an important factor positively influencing q. At both 308 K and 313 K, the binding of Cd2+ to RPs belonged to spontaneous, endothermic interactions with high-affinity, assigned to a multidentate coordination. Except for acetate, all the investigated competing coordination agents, such as edetate, pyrophosphate and citrate, showed inhibitory effects on RPs-Cd2+ binding, and edetate seemed to be the most effective one. At pH 6.5, calcium, copper and zinc began to restrict RPs-Cd2+ binding when the metal ion concentration reached 500 mg/kg, and the decreasing of pH would strengthen the inhibitory effects of the investigated metal ions including ferric ions.

AB To achieve efficient one-step production of gluconic acid, cascade reactions of glucose oxidase (GOD) and catalase (CAT) have been advocated in the biocatalysis system. In this work, the methodology of co-immobilization of GOD and CAT was investigated in details for obtaining improved enzyme loading and activity. The maximum adsorption capability of GOD and CAT was 24.18 and 14.33 mg.g(-1), respectively. The matching between dimensions of enzymes and hierarchical pore sizes of carriers are critical to the success of immobilization process. The simultaneous self-assembly on glutaraldehyde cross-linked mesoporous carriers exhibited favorable properties in comparison with sequential immobilization of GOD and CAT. The conversion of glucose under adequate air by co-localized GOD&CAT sustained the activity more than 90% after repeated utilization in the production of sodium gluconate and gluconic acid, suggesting that the co-immobilized GOD&CAT could be a promising catalyst for gluconate and gluconic acid production in some chemical and food industries.

AB In this study, simple GC-MS methods for analysising sixteen PAHs and seven PAEs were individually established. The LOQs for PAHs and PAEs were ranging from 0.18 to 0.42 mu g/kg and 0.19 to 1.50 mu g/kg, respectively. The recoveries for DD samples were in the range of 84.8-115.5% and 84.2-109.3% for PAHs and PAEs, respectively. Furthermore, PAHs and PAEs concentrations in soybean, rapeseed, corn and rice bran oil distillates were evaluated. PAHs were found in all the DD samples and the concentrations of BaP, PAH4 and total PAHs were 0.89-55.58, 8.11-326.07 and 115.77-966.40 mu g/kg, respectively. Correspondingly, total PAEs concentrations ranged from 2.45 to 24.52 mg/kg, and the mean value was 7.76 mg/kg. The results illustrated that the contents of PAHs and PAEs in the DDs were extremely higher than those in the edible oils, thus indicating that specific issues should be considered in the vegetable oil DDs and DD-based products.

AB The use of grain proteins in various types of meat products is common practice. A reliable detection of these food ingredients is required to control specifications and regarding food fraud and allergenic potential. Consequently, a sensitive HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous detection of barley, maize, oats, rice, rye and wheat proteins in meat products was developed. After protein extraction and tryptic digestion, three to four selected marker peptides for each grain species were measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Emulsion-type sausages with grain-based protein concentrations in the range of 5-1000 mg/kg and blank values were produced. The limits of detection of the method were <= 5 or <= 10 mg grain protein/kg meat product for each grain species and no false-positive or -negative results were obtained. The delectability of the marker peptides only slightly decreased after storage and grilling of sausages, whereas the influence of the canning process was noticeably higher.

AB Beans age during storage leading to prolonged cooking times. Chemical reactions that occur during cooking lead to volatile production and flavor generation. Whereas few studies profiled the volatile fingerprint of either non-cooked beans or beans cooked for a specific time, this study explored the evolution of volatiles through headspace fingerprinting of beans cooked at 95 degrees C to different extents. The influence of aging of beans on this evolution was investigated. Cooking time clearly influenced the evolution of volatiles for both fresh (non-aged) and aged beans. Aged beans exhibited more discriminant compounds than fresh beans regardless of texture considerations due to differences in pre-history of the beans. Strecker aldehydes, sulphur compounds and furan compounds were identified as marker compounds and were linked to mainly lipid oxidation and Maillard reactions. In conclusion, both aging prior to cooking and the cooking process itself largely influence the evolution of volatile compounds during cooking.

Fuyan) fruit. The results showed that, compared to the control longans, L. theobromae-inoculated longans displayed higher indices of fruit disease and pericarp browning, lower pericarp ATP and ADP contents, higher AMP content, lower level of energy charge, as well as lower activities of Ca2+-ATPase, Mg2+-ATPase and H+-ATPase in membranes of plasma, vacuole, and mitochondria. These results indicated that the infection of L. theobromae reduced energy status and ATPase activities, caused ions disorder, damaged the integrity and function of the cell and organelles including vacuole and mitochondria in pericarp of longan fruit, which contributed to L. theobromae-promoted disease development and pericarp browning of harvested longan fruit during storage.

AB In this study, zein-propylene glycol alginate-rhamnolipid complex particles were prepared with suitable three-phase contact angles (theta) for stabilizing oil-in-water Pickering high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs). At a fixed oil phase volume (phi = 0.75), particle concentration influenced the stability, physical properties, and rheology of HIPEs. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that complex particles formed a densely packed particle layer around the oil droplets and a three-dimensional network in the continuous phase, highlighting the potential for the complex particles to act as effective RIPE stabilizers. The storage modulus (G') was higher than loss modulus (G '') over the entire angular frequency range, suggesting HIPEs had an elastic gel-like structure. The HIPEs had good stability across a range of environmental conditions (pH, temperatures and salt concentrations). These findings may extend the application of zein in foods and the HIPEs formed may be used as novel delivery system for bioactives.

AB A modified QuEChERS protocol, coupled to HPLC-MS/MS, was used for the analysis of 102 pesticides in green teas produced in Jiangxi province, China. For accurate quantification, matrix-matched calibration curves were applied to compensate for matrix effects. Recoveries for these pesticides ranged from 62% to 125% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 18%. The limits of detection and quantification ranged from 0.03 to 15 mu g/kg and 0.1 to 50 mu g/kg, respectively. We determined that 67% of green tea samples contained some pesticide residues and most contained more than five pesticides. Moreover, the levels of 11 pesticide residues in 18 samples were found to be greater than the values permitted in EC Regulation No. 396/2005.

AB Glucose oxidase (GOD) is an enzyme widely used in glucose monitoring systems owing to its high specificity towards glucose. However, in our previous work maltose was found to show significant interaction with GOD and based on this observation, a novel microplate-based method was developed to assess alpha-amylase inhibitory activity (GOD method). Concerns regarding the interaction of GOD with maltose has limited the widespread use of the GOD method in assessing alpha-amylase activity. The present paper provides answers to concerns regarding the interaction of GOD with maltose using HPLC studies and application of the GOD method in assessing alpha-amylase activity. According to the results, the newly developed GOD method can be considered as a well-suited method for the determination of a-amylase activity and as an easy method to do kinetic studies compared to other available methods.

AB One challenge for daidzein delivery is how to efficiently suppress its precipitation/crystallization in a lipid-based system. In this work, whey protein isolate (WPI) with different thermal treatment was employed as a hydrophobic drug crystallization depressor and its interaction mechanism with daidzein was studied. The results indicated WPI aggregated to form nanoparticles (below 300 nm) in the presence of daidzein. Thermal denaturing (85 degrees C, 20 min) improved the binding affinity for daidzein with Ka = 1.165 x 10(4) M-1, about 1.5-fold higher than that of the native protein (Ka = 7.285 x 10(3) M-1). Hydrophobic interaction was the major driving forces based on thermodynamic calculation. The as-obtained protein-based nanocomplexes efficiently inhibited daidzein crystallization, enhancing its solubility at least 2-fold with promoted stability (stable at 4 degrees C for at least 2 months). These findings provide new ideas for the application of WPI, showing great potential to be directly used in lipid nanocarrier system as crystallization depressor.

AB In the present study, the influence of production systems (net-house and open-field) on volatile profiles of three Texas A&M University (TAMU) and five commercial tomato varieties was investigated. Forty metabolites were determined using headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) equipped with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The data was evaluated by multivariate analyses to discriminate the effects of genotype and production system, and to identify potential biomarker(s). The levels of hexanal, p-cymene, and (E)-2-hexenal from TAMU varieties were distinct from those of commercial tomato varieties. Similarly, 16 metabolites were considerably affected by the production systems, and majority of these volatiles were significantly higher in the net-house-grown tomatoes. Multivariate analysis also allowed identifying geranylacetone and D-limonene as potential biomarkers to classify tomatoes according to production systems. These findings underline the importance of the selection of variety and production system to preserve or improve desirable aroma traits in tomatoes.

AB The co-melting behaviour of sugar mixtures, comprising sucrose, glucose and fructose at various binary (3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 1:7, 1:15) and ternary (4:1:1, 2:1:1, 1:1:1, 2:5:5, 2:11:11, 1:4:1, 1:10:1) ratios, was studied using DSC. The melting temperature of sucrose was found to decrease in the presence of either fructose or glucose. In the sugar mixtures, the melting enthalpy of sucrose decreased compared with the proportional calculated values, using the percentage equation, whilst the melting enthalpy of fructose or glucose increased at the same time, implying the melting or dissolution of sucrose together with fructose or glucose. The tested enthalpy is usually higher than the calculated enthalpy for fructose, but lower than the calculated enthalpy for sucrose. Microscopic pictures showed that sucrose crystals could melt and dissolve gradually in the fructose melt liquid. This study provides useful information for both fundamental understanding of sugars co-melting and food industry applications.

AB To expound the copigmentation effects of phenolics on blackberry wine residue anthocyanins (BWRA), the color and stability of BWRA with storage, thermal, light and oxidation treatments were evaluated by chromaticity, kinetics and structural simulation analysis. Results indicated that phenolic acids showed preferable copigmetation on BWRA solutions with the enhanced color, thermostability at 50-70 degrees C and light stability, whereas the degradation was accelerated at 90 degrees C. Meanwhile, flavonoids promoted the oxidation stability of BWRA. Of all the phenolic acids, ferulic acid presented the best copigmentation effect, and among the flavonoids rutin was the most active. Structural simulation suggested rutin and ferulic acid had the largest volume, potential energy (164.8 and 32.8 kcal/mol), minimized energy (39.2 and 11.3 kal/mol) and van der Waals energy (81.6 and 28.1 kcal/mol), respectively, which were favorable to the stabilization of the flavylium ion. The hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking and solvent effects were together involved in the copigmentation mechanism.

AB Heat- and ultrasound-assisted extraction methods were applied to recover anthocyanins from Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces. The extraction variables, time (t), ethanol proportion (S), and temperature (T) or ultrasonic power (P), were combined in a 5-level experimental design and analysed by response surface methodology for process optimization. The delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside (C1) and cyanidin-3-O-sambubioside (C2) levels were monitored by LC-DAD-ESI/MSn and used as response criteria. The developed models were successfully fitted to the experimental data and used to determine optimal extraction conditions. UAE was the most efficient method yielding 51.76 mg C1 + C2/g R under optimal conditions (t = 26.1 min, P = 296.6 W and S = 39.1% ethanol, v/v). The dose-response effects of the solid/liquid ratio on the extraction rate were also determined. The anthocyanin levels herein reported are higher than those found in the literature, which support the potential use of H. sabdariffa as a sustainable source of natural colorants with application in different industrial sectors.

AB The potentialities of front-face fluorescence (FFF) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopies coupled with partial least square regression (PLSR) were compared to predict the lipid oxidation of pound cakes. The level of lipid oxidation in pound cakes determined using classical methods showed some changes. Similarly, the fluorescence emission (305-490 nm) and excitation (252-390 nm) spectra and MIR spectra scanned in the 4000-700 cm(-1) region showed some changes in pound cakes as a function of both storage time and the type of oil used in the formulation. The application of PLSR to the MIR spectra, provided excellent predictive results for free fatty acid (R-2 = 0.97) and peroxide values (R-2 = 0.87). Similar results were obtained from both tryptophan and MIR spectra for the prediction of TOTOX (R-2 > 0.86) demonstrating the efficiency of the MIR and FFF spectroscopies to qualify and quantify the level of lipid oxidation in pound cakes.

AB Sixty-five samples of red garlic (Allium sativum L.) coming from four different production territories of Italy were analysed by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The garlic samples were discriminated according to the geographical origin using the content of seven elements (Ba, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na and Sr). Both classification and class modelling methods by using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and soft independent model class analogy (SIMCA), respectively, were applied. Classification ability and modelling efficiency were evaluated on an external prediction set (21 garlic samples) designed by application of duplex Kennard-Stone algorithm. All the calibration and prediction samples were correctly classified by means of LDA. The class models developed using SIMCA exhibited high sensitivity (almost all the calibration and external samples were accepted by the respective classes) and good specificity (the majority of extraneous samples were refused by each class model).

AB Five novel compounds (Gen-NO2, Gen-2NO(2), Gen-NH2, Gen-2NH(2) and Gen-6NH(2)) have been designed via introducing an electron-withdrawing group -NO2 and an electron-donating group -NH2 into the structure of genistein. The effects of -NO2 and -NH2 groups on the antioxidant ability of genistein were investigated via quantum chemistry method in gas and methanol phases. The crucial parameters related to three antioxidant mechanisms were calculated. Moreover, the frontier molecular orbital, natural bond orbital and global descriptive parameters were calculated to evaluate the reactivity of genistein and its derivatives. Calculated results indicate the antioxidant process of genistein and its derivatives inclines to the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET) mechanisms in gas and methanol phases, respectively. Moreover, introducing -NH2 group into genistein can improve its antioxidant activity owing to the outstanding activities of amino-substituents of genistein, which will provide valuable guidance for the synthesis of new antioxidants experimentally.

AB Tannins are compounds with antinutrient properties that hinder food digestibility, prejudicing human and animal nutrition. This work aimed to evaluate the negative effects of tannic acid on Kluyveromyces lactis beta-galactosidase catalytic activity and correlate these changes with the protein structure. beta-Galactosidase activity decreased in the presence of tannins, which caused changes to the structure of the enzyme, as demonstrated by circular dichroism. It was verified that tannin binds to the protein by a static mechanism. Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry suggested that tannic acid modified the molecular interaction between beta-galactosidase and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside, reducing their affinity and prejudicing the protein activity. This study helps to understand the effects of tannins on the beta-galactosidase structure and how they are related to the enzyme catalytic activity. The alterations in the conformation and activity of the enzyme should be taken into consideration when dairy products are consumed with tannin-rich food.

AB The antioxidant capacity (AC) of six dihydrochalcone compounds was evaluated using DPPH and ABTS assays. In water-based solution 3-hydroxyphlorizin exhibited the highest AC among all dihydrochalcones. In acetone and acidic solutions (pH = 2.5 or 2.0), presence of an o-dihydroxyl at the B-ring increased AC, whereas glycosylation at the A-ring decreased AC of dihydrochalcones. By comparing the AC of dihydrochalcones with similar structures, it was found that the o-dihydroxyl at the B-ring and 2'-hydroxyl group at the A-ring were critical for maintaining the AC of dihydrochalcones by promoting hydrogen atom transfer or single electron transfer mechanism. Sequential proton-loss electron transfer commonly occurred during free radical scavenging in waterbased solution. Moreover, we report a unique phenomenon in which glycosylation at the 2'-position enhanced the dissociation ability of the 4'-hydroxyl group and increased the AC of dihydrochalcones containing o-dihydroxyl. We speculate that this increase in AC might occur through intramolecular electron transfer.

AB The profiles of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacities of four finger millet varieties harvested in northern Malawi were investigated. The total phenolics, flavonoids and condensed tannins in the free fractions ranged from 114.43 to 179.19 mg ferulic acid equivalent (FAE)/100 g, 90.24 to 202.94 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/100 g and 31.76 to 83.59 mg CE/100 g, respectively. Total phenolic contents of the bound fractions ranged from 58.27 to 123.23 mg FAE/100 g. Twenty phenolic compounds were identified in the free fractions including eighteen flavonoids, with catechin and epicatechin being the predominant flavonoids. Seventeen phenolic compounds were identified in the bound fractions, with ferulic acid being the predominant one. Ten of the identified polyphenols were firstly reported in finger millet. Darker colored finger millet varieties had higher phenolic contents and antioxidant properties than the lighter colored ones. Finger millet can be used as healthy food material and natural antioxidant resource.

AB The potential of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to quantify the met-myoglobin (met-Mb) proportion and meat oxygenation inside of pork and beef was examined. First, reflection spectra were obtained from pork (n = 52) and beef (n = 43) samples under fresh and stored conditions. Second, the DRS algorithm was applied to the reflectance spectra to calculate the met-Mb proportion and oxygenation of the meat. Lastly, a regression model was developed showing the change in the met-Mb proportion and oxygenation during met-Mb formation and degradation. A linear relationship existed between the DRS-based computed data and the known met-Mb proportion with a high correlation (R-2 = 0.9999) and a low error (0.86%). Measurement of the meat samples revealed a linear increment of the met-Mb proportion (R-2 = 0.77) and a quadratic change in the oxygenation (R-2 = 0.44) during the met-Mb formation process. This study demonstrated the ability of DRS to quantitatively analyze the relative content of myoglobin derivatives in both pork and beef.

AB This work reports the feasibility of utilizing sulfonated polystyrene nanospheres (SPS NSs) to extract heavy metals from collagen solutions. We have endeavored to present a detailed study on the adsorption characteristics and mechanism of heavy metals including Pb2+, Mn2+, Cr3+ and Cd2+. The adsorption isotherms were fitted by the Langmuir and Freundlich models while the adsorption kinetics data were described by the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion equations. The adsorption isotherms were better fitted by the Langmuir model, leading to theoretical maximum capacities of 50.7, 15.0, 8.7 and 39.0 mg g(-1) for the adsorption of Pb2+, Mn2+, Cr3+ and Cd2+, respectively. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were conducted to detect the heat exchange of the adsorption processes. As a proof of concept, SPS NSs were practically applied in sequestrating heavy metals from Talapia-fish-scale derived collagen. The effects of pH of the collagen solutions in the removal of metals were investigated. By a single treatment, the concentrations of the metal ions were decreased to the regulatory standards whilst the concentration of collagen proteins was well maintained.

AB Tracing the geographical origin of chocolate is of increasing importance owing to the market growth of cocoa products of high quality and especially where value is derived from those products being of single origin. The NMR analysis of methanolic/aqueous extracts of dark chocolate samples from Peru, Venezuela and Madagascar is reported and 42 different chemical constituents are identified, quantified and analysed using multivariate techniques. This paper describes a simple non-destructive protocol, which look at the chemical profile for chocolate samples from these three geographical locations and demonstrates potential for assessing the provenance of chocolate products, which has implications in food quality, safety and authenticity.

AB In the present study, a convenient and highly efficient method was developed to quantify aflatoxin B-1(AFB(1)) in oil samples. Low temperature clean-up (LTC) followed by immuno magnetic solid phase extraction (IMSPE) was used to clean up oil samples. LTC assisted in freezing out the interference from the oil matrix while IMSPE further helped to preconcentrate the targeted analyze. For IMSPE, we synthesised and characterised anti-AFB(1) monoclonal antibody-functionalised magnetic nanoparticles. Oil sample extraction was then carried out using LTC-IMSPE. The proposed method showed satisfactory efficiency and reproducibility with recovery rates being within the range of 79.6-117.9%, with a relative standard deviation below 11.48%. The sensitivity of the method was satisfactory with the limits of detection and quantification being as low as 0.0048 and 0.0126 ng.g(-1), respectively. Real sample analysis was carried out for five kinds of different vegetable oils. The results suggest that the method developed is very sensitive and accurate.

AB The interaction between stomach porcine mucin and 3 oenological tannins (extract of ellagitannins from oak, extract of gallotannins from gall nuts and extract of proanthocyanidins from grape seeds) was measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). These tannins were analysed and their astringency was determined using the Astringency Index method and by tasting. The interaction constants were determined using a Biacore SPR device (1:1 Langmuir binding model). The results indicate that the ellagitannins are more astringent than gallotannins and those, in turn, are more astringent than seed proanthocyanidins if the richness of the commercial extracts is considered. The astringency index of these tannins had high correlation and regression coefficients with their kinetic and thermodynamic dissociation constants. This data support a hypothesis that astringency depends not only on the thermodynamic tendency to form the complex between tannins and salivary proteins but also probably on the time required to dissociate the complex.

AB Traditional sterilization leads to poor vinosity of Chinese rice wine (CRW). Effects of boiling, ultra-high temperature (UHT) and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on CRW quality were investigated. Thermal treatment resulted in a decrease of total free amino-acids (FAA), whereas HHP-treatment caused an increase. However, UHT and HHP treatments had little effect on FAA with sweet and umami-like flavor. HHP-treated CRW contained 7.35% higher content of flavors relative to untreated wine, while thermally-treated CRW revealed 4.68-8.61% losses. Based on principal component analysis, CRW processed at 400 or 600 MPa for 10 min exhibited similar flavor to the untreated wine, which was highly associated with long-chain fatty acid ethyl esters (C-13-C-18). Moreover, partial least squares regression demonstrated that sensory attributes of cereal aroma and astringency were highlighted after thermal treatment, while fruit aroma, continuation and full body were dominant after HHP treatment. HHP treatment effectively enhanced the quality of CRW, which could be applied in other alcoholic beverages.

AB The influence of the incorporation of blackberry pulp on properties of arrowroot starch films has been studied. The blackberry pulp transferred bioactive compounds, antioxidant capacity and color to arrowroot starch films. Increasing the concentration of blackberry pulp (from 0 to 40%, mass/mass of dry starch) in the film resulted in increased thickness (from 0.065 to 0.133 mm), increased elongation (from 3.18 to 13.59%), decreased tensile strength (from 22.71 to 3.97 MPa), increased water vapor permeability (from 3.62 to 4.60 g.mm/m(2).day.kPa) and solubility in water (from 14.18 to 25.46%). The films were stable to different media, maintaining the same initial diameter dimensions after immersion in acidic, neutral and alkaline solutions, but their color intensity was reduced, probably due to the release of anthocyanins to the solutions. The films with blackberry pulp presented darkness after sterilization process.

AB An extract from Arbutus unedo fruits, rich in anthocyanins, was studied as a natural colorant with bioactive properties (antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic). The aqueous stability of the extract was monitored using the anthocyanins' content as response (determined by HPLC-DAD) in function of time, temperature and pH. Aided by mechanistic/phenomenological models, the conditions that favours the stabilization of the extract were provided, highlighting the suitability of the colorant for pastry/bakery products. As a case study, the extract was incorporated into wafers and the changes on the nutritional profile, free sugars, fatty acids and antioxidant properties were monitored during 6 days of storage. The results provide information for: i) potential application of the rich extract in anthocyanins for producing a natural colorant with bioactive properties; and ii) shelf-life predictions. The extract incorporation did not cause changes in the nutritional components of wafers but added colorant and antioxidant properties.

AB The influences of abscisic acid (ABA)-guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) on UV-B treatment-stimulated isoflavone synthesis in soybean sprouts was explored. It turned out that ABA, with cGMP, up-regulated gene expression and activity of chalcone synthase (CHS) and isoflavone synthase (IFS), and subsequently induced isoflavone biosynthesis under UV-B treatment. Furthermore, data obtained from the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis showed that there were two core components in ABA response: SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK) and type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C), were up and down regulated after UV-B treatment, respectively. UV-B exposure stimulated increment in guanine nucleotide-binding protein and calreticulin expression. Additionally, CHS and IFS protein expression were up regulated under UV-B stress. Overall, UV-B-induced ABA resulted in PP2C inhibition and SnRK2 activation, and up-regulated CHS and IFS expression, leading to enhancement of isoflavone accumulation. cGMP and calreticulin as downstream messengers, mediated ABA-stimulated isoflavone biosynthesis after UV-B exposure.

AB Celiac disease, characterized by autoimmune reactions to dietary gluten, affects up to 3 million in the US and approximately 0.5%-1% globally. A strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is the only treatment. An economic, simple, accurate, rapid and portable gluten testing device would enable gluten-sensitive individuals to safeguard their food safety. We developed a novel solution, Nima (TM), a gluten sensor that integrates food processing, gluten detection, result interpretation and data transmission in a portable device, detecting gluten proteins at or below the accepted 20 ppm threshold. We developed specific monoclonal antibodies, an optimized lateral flow immunoassay strip, and one-step aqueous extraction. Compared with reference R5, Nima (TM) antibodies (13F6 and 14G11) had 35- and 6.6-fold higher gliadin affinities, respectively. We demonstrated device performance using a comprehensive list of foods, assessing detection sensitivity, reproducibility, and cross-reactivity. Nima (TM) presented a 99.0% true positive rate, with a 95% confidence interval of 97.8%-100%.

AB In this study, chia seed oil (CSO) microcapsules were produced using three types of shell materials, including chia seed protein (CPI), chia seed gum (CSG) and CPI-CSG complex coacervates. Synchrotron-Fourier transform infrared (S-FTIR) microspectroscopy was used to investigate the effect of shell materials on the distribution of CSO both on the surface and in the interior of the solid microcapsules. S-FTIR measurements were carried out in macroscopic attenuated total reflection (macro ATR) and transmission modes, to determine the surface lipid and the encapsulated lipid fractions, respectively. The amounts of lipid and protein distributed on the surface and in the interior of the microcapsules were compared based on the average spectra extracted from S-FTIR chemical images obtained from each type of the microcapsules. The unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) to total oil ratios in all the three types of the microcapsules were closely similar to the original non-processed CSO, suggesting an effective encapsulation and thereby shielding protection of UFAs from oxidative damage during microencapsulation process. The type of the shell materials was found to affect the distribution of CSO on the surface and within the microcapsules. The complex coacervation based microcapsules had a significantly lower oil content (similar to 2% w/w) on the surface compared to those observed for the other two types of microcapsules (> 5%, w/w).

AB It has been shown that 15 mu W.cm(-2) UV-B radiation has the most pronounced effects on gamma-aminobutiric acid (GABA), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in 4-day-old soybean sprouts. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action, from the perspective of protein expression, remains largely unknown. In this study, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) were employed to investigate UV-B treatment-induced proteomic changes in soybean sprouts. Results showed that UV-B treatment effectively regulated proteins involved in GABA biosynthesis, such as glutamate synthase, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), methionine synthetase, 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine methyltransferase, aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase (AMADH) and inositol phosphate metabolism pathways, including phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), purple acid phosphatase (PAP) and inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. In addition, proteins involved in ABA biosynthesis and signal transduction, such as 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), abscisic-aldehyde oxidase (AO), SNFl-related protein kinase (SnRK), protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), guanine nucleotide-binding protein and calreticulin-3, were also modulated under UV-B treatment.

AB Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has emerged as a fast, reliable, non-invasive and sensitive method to determine the distribution, localization and reactivity of labelled ingredients in micro-heterogeneous systems. However, the commercially available probe molecules are very limited. In the present work, five new nitroxide [(4-hydroxy-2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL)] derivatives (1b-5b) of diacetyl tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides (DATEM) (1a-5a), a widely used food emulsifier, were synthesized under Steglich conditions and characterized by MS (mass-spectrometry), FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), EPR, NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), fluorescence spectroscopy, and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) analysis. Phase partitioning studies proved that the new spin labels are adequately capable of describing the localizations and partitioning of the corresponding DATEM in multi-phase systems. Findings disclosed in this work will provide new knowledge on ingredient reactivity and localization in multi-phase systems; which is vital to aid the design of more efficient delivery systems for bioactive compounds.

AB A one-step anion-exchange chromatography method (NaCl gradient elution on a DEAE Sepharos (TM) Fast Flow gel column) was developed to purify alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) from whey protein isolate. alpha-LA nearly 100% pure (based on the total protein content) was obtained with a yield of about 39%. Besides pure alpha-LA, which was the main objective of this work, highly pure beta-lactoglobulin was also obtained with a yield of about 59%. The high purity of the obtained alpha-LA samples allowed its use to synthesise protein nanotubes with excellent gelation properties for their use as food thickeners and bioactive carriers. The samples' purity degree obtained (based on the total protein content) was critical in the formation of proper nanotubes instead of random aggregates, which produced opaque and weak gels, less useful for food applications.

AB This study investigated the efficiency of the extraction of phenolic compounds from seeds of chia, Salvia hispanica L. utilizing the statistical tool of mixture planning, simplex-lattice design. The solvents used were acetone, ethanol and water and the responses analyzed were total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity by the capture of the free radical DPPH and ferric reduction ability (FRAP). Moderately polar mixtures were highly efficient to extract the antioxidant phenolic compounds. The best results were obtained for the water-acetone (1/ 3-2/3) binary mixture, presenting TPC, DPPP and FRAP values of 58.44 mg GAE/g, 250.20 mu mol TE/g and 720.15 mu mol TE/g, respectively. The best ternary mixture was water-ethanol-acetone (1/6-1/6-2/3), with 60.96 mg GAE/g, 380.53 mu mol TE/g and 990.15 mu mol TE/g, respectively. The phenolic profile showed that the acids rosmarinic, caffeic, salicylic and the flavonoids myricetin and quercetin are the compounds that most contribute to the elevated antioxidant activity.

AB This study develops a reliable radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) to estimate freshness for tilapia fillets stored under non-isothermal conditions by using optimal wavelengths from hyperspectral imaging (HSI). The results show that, for tilapia fillet stored at -3, 0, 4, 10, and 15 degrees C and non-isothermal conditions, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), total aerobic counts (TAC), and the K value increase whereas sensory scores decrease with increasing storage time. To simplify the models, nine optimal wavelengths were selected by using the successive projections algorithm (SPA), following which SPA-RBFNN models were built based on the selected wavelengths and the values of TVB-N, TAC, K, and sensory evaluations for tilapia fillets store isothermally. The ability of the models based on HSI to predict the freshness indicators were verified for tilapia fillets stored under non-isothermal conditions. HSI thus has an excellent potential for nondestructive determination of freshness in tilapia fillets.

AB Milk proteins have shown to be very sensitive to heated processing. This study investigated the heat-dependent changes of goat milk proteins using label-free quantification (LFQ). A total of 843 proteins were identified in all the samples, of which 625 proteins were quantified. There were 527, 543, 537, 533 and 539 proteins quantified in the control group (CG) and heated groups (HGs: HG1, HG2, HG3 and HG4), respectively, and 438 proteins were common to all groups. The effects of high temperature/short time (HTST) treatment on proteins were similar to ultra-pasteurization (UP) and ultra-high temperature (UHT), but the low temperature/long time (LTLT) was different. Proteomics analysis demonstrated that heated processing increases the digestibility of proteins and is beneficial for anti-atherosclerosis therapy. These results expand the knowledge of the protein compositions from different heated processing. And it can further the utilization of the protein component of goat milk for human nutrition and health.

AB This article is the first part of a series reporting on real-time digestion kinetics of triglyceride droplets containing different lipophilic micronutrients. This part focuses on the design, fabrication, and operation of a poly-dimethylsiloxane microfluidic device which enables the generation and digestion of oil droplets. The microchannels were made hydrophilic to obtain oil droplets in an aqueous continuous phase. Optimized chip design and outlet control were implemented to provide efficient oil droplet generation, manipulation, and immobilization on a single chip. Highly monodisperse oil droplets were generated, immobilized in an array of traps and monitored in real time by fluorescence using a confocal microscopy method. The device was used to study the kinetics of beta-carotene release during tricaprylin digestion (intestinal lipolysis and micellar solubilization). The effect of the gastric phase on beta-carotene degradation was also investigated using the same method.

AB At present, matrix interferences in tea are still a great challenge for analysis of multi-pesticide residues. Herein, a simple sample preparation method was developed based on the modified dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) procedure and cold-induced acetonitrile aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS). In modified DSPE procedure, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) was selected as the matrix dispersive adsorbent to remove polyphenols from the tea with the removal rate of > 98.3%. Using cold-induced acetonitrile ATPS, caffeine of the tea extract was sharply reduced by 81.2%, and a 0.798-3.167 of enrichment factor for the representative pesticides was achieved. In liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry analysis, a full scan/data independent acquisition approach was used for the nontargeted screening and targeted determination of pesticides. In data analysis, an in-house database of pesticides was constructed, and a simple accurate mass calibration method was used to correct the accurate mass variation, which was conducive to reduce the number of false detects.

AB Red cabbage waste is a valuable source of anthocyanins which may be used as natural food dye. Excepting the colouring agents, food/beverage contains compounds from the matrix or other additives/ingredients. Present study reveals the influences of nineteen food additives/ingredients on the stability, colour parameters and radical scavenging activity during 20 weeks of storage of red cabbage waste hydroethanolic extract (initial pH = 6.31) under aerobic atmosphere, in the dark, at 4 degrees C. At studied concentration (0.2%), most important changes were produced by tartaric and citric acids: decrease of monomeric anthocyanins content, lightness, radical scavenging activity, and increase of polymeric colour, browning and degradation indices, chroma and red colour parameter, absolute value of blue colour parameter and hue angle, inducing very important overall colourimetric differences. Similar influences, but much attenuated, proved ascorbic and benzoic acids. During storage, the untreated extracts revealed a very high stability, and also mostly of treated extracts (especially with sugars).

AB In the present study, the mechanisms employed by exogenous melatonin applying for conferring chilling tolerance in tomato fruits during storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days were investigated. Conferring chilling tolerance in tomato fruits in response to exogenous melatonin applying at 100 mu M may arise from upregulating SlZAT2/6/12 giving rise to triggering CBF1 gene expression. Employing higher arginine pathway activity in tomato fruits by exogenous melatonin applying demonstrating by higher endogenous polyamines accumulation arising from higher ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and arginine decarboxylase (ADC) genes expression and enzymes activity, higher endogenous proline accumulation arising from higher pyroline 5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) genes expression and enzymes activity accompanying by lower proline dehydrogenase (PDH) gene expression and enzyme activity and higher endogenous nitric oxide (NO) accumulation arising from higher nitric oxide synthase (NOS) gene expression and enzyme activity may be responsible for keeping safe membrane integrity.

AB Chayote (Sechium edule) has gained widespread consuming acceptance and recognized by its nutritional and biofunctional properties. The present review surveys and describes the current findings about the nutritional, phytochemical and pharmacological properties of chayote and identifies opportunities for further research. It also discusses chayote's versatile utility in nutrition, as a functional ingredient in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in nanotechnology and biotechnological processes. It was concluded that although the pharmacological properties of chayote are currently well-established, only a few reports have been conducted on the isolation and identification of individual chemical constituents, and similarly, only a few in vivo studies have been conducted to assess their biological efficacy. In addition, the valorisation of the underutilized chayote by-products can be an important aspect in waste management from both economic and environmental standpoints. Thus, the recovery and utilization of valuable compounds from chayote is an important challenge for scientists.

AB Hard wheat flour doughs were prepared with five different levels of sodium chloride, and rheological properties were characterized. Zeta potential, disulfide-sulfhydryl groups, surface hydrophobicity, secondary structure, and extractable gliadin and glutenin of gluten were analyzed to elucidate gluten structure changes induced by salt. Addition of higher levels of salt (2.0 and 2.4%, fwb) in doughs resulted in larger storage and loss modulus, and elongational viscosity. Starch gelatinization temperatures increased with higher amounts of salt. The presence of salt decreased the free sulfhydryl content but increased the beta-sheet structure of gluten. RP-HPLC indicated that salt enhanced the macromolecular aggregation of gluten proteins. The changes in gluten molecular conformation and network structure induced by salt significantly contributed to the improved physicochemical properties of dough. This study provides a better understanding of salt functionality in hard wheat flour dough and a valuable guide in searching for salt alternatives for bakery products.

AB The effects of autoclave and microwave heating on the protein and oil in soybean seeds were investigated under low moisture conditions. The nitrogen solubility index (NSI) decreased on heating. The reduction in the NSI was accompanied by an increase in the size and deformation of the oil bodies in the cellular tissue of soybean seeds. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that lipoxygenase was susceptible to heat denaturation, but 7S and 11S globulins were only partially denatured. The partial denaturation of the proteins was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. The ratio of oil to protein peaks increased with increasing heating, suggesting the exudation of oil to the surface or outside of oil bodies. Microwave heating is more efficient in changing the oil distribution in soybean seeds than autoclave heating. On the other hand, the degree of protein denaturation is lower after microwave heating.

AB This work characterises and distinguishes Italian and Asian goji berries, combining three analytical approaches to determine 5 light stable isotope ratios, 57 mineral elements and 14 carotenoids.
   The study analyses stable isotope ratios and provides full HPLC-DAD-MS characterisation of the carotenoid fraction in goji berries for the first time. The isotopic composition of Italian berries was characterised by delta C-13 values ranging between -28.2 parts per thousand and - 25.7 parts per thousand, delta N-15 between 2.3 and 7.3 parts per thousand, delta S-34 between 2.6 and 7.9 parts per thousand, and D/H between -112 and - 49 parts per thousand.
   Italian goji berries were shown to have a particular composition and interesting nutritional characteristics, specifically a higher total carotenoid content (355 mg/100 g dw mean content vs 198 mg/100 g dw) and higher content of some micronutrients: K, B, Cu, Mo, Se, and Zn.
   On the basis of delta S-34, Y, U, Cu, Rb, zeaxanthin palmitate and total carotenoid content, discriminant analysis correctly classified all samples according to their geographical origin.

AB Catechin is astringent in taste, sparingly soluble in water and sensitive to oxygen, light and pH. These properties restrict its application in food products. The present study investigated the stability of inclusion complex (IC) and catechin in various food matrices and investigated in vitro recovery profile of catechin and IC in liquid, semi-solid and solid food matrices. Besides, the sensory profile of IC added yogurt was also determined. Results showed that IC and catechin was more stable in solid matrix compared to semi-solid and liquid matrices. IC added in milk and yogurt show the highest percentage recovery of catechin compared to IC added in cheese and catechin added in all the matrices in in vitro digestive system. Through IC, beta-CD masked the bitterness of catechin. These results suggest that protection of antioxidant such as catechin by beta-CD inclusion complex may have applications in functional foods and health supplements.

AB Changes in physico-chemical properties, microstructure, protein structures and intermolecular force of egg yolk, plasma and granule gels during salting were investigated, using low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and chemical analysis. The results showed that the contents of soluble protein and free sulfhydryl increased and, with D2O treatment, T-21 and T(22 )decreased in egg yolks and plasma salted for 2 d. The particles of egg yolks, plasma and granules in the later stage of salting were disrupted and they liberated their constituents (phospholipids, neutral lipids and proteins), which randomly aggregated. The treatment with NaCl changed the spatial structure of egg yolk proteins. The results suggested that the oil exudation of salted egg yolks was mainly due to structural changes in the low-density lipoproteins. Granules were shown to contribute to the higher hardness and gelation of salted egg yolks.

AB Soybean plants of the variety 'MG/BR Conquista' were grown in open top chambers, simulating elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and high temperature under the following treatments: 1) ambient [CO2] and ambient temperature (Amb); 2) elevated [CO2] (eCO(2)) and ambient temperature (Elev); 3) ambient [CO2] and high temperature (Amb/Temp); 4) elevated CO2 and high temperature (Elev/Temp). The aim was to evaluate responses to elevated [CO2] and high temperature, with focus on plant development and seed yield, and composition. Elev stimulated grain yield and Amb/Temp had opposite effect. Several biochemical parameters were affected by Amb/Temp, most of them reversed by simultaneous application of Elev. The oil obtained with Elev/Temp had lower degree of unsaturation. A network of relationships among biochemical parameters of grains at three developmental stages revealed that Amb/Temp and Elev/Temp affect significantly both carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms. No significant difference was obtained comparing networks corresponding to Amb and Elev/Temp.

AB Wild rice (Zizania spp.) is considered by many consumers to be a health-promoting food. The perennial Z. latifolia (native to Asia) and annual Z. palustris (native to North America) are crops to produce Chinese and North American wild rice, respectively. In this study, we compare the metabolomes of the two species using a UHPLC-QqQ-MS-based metabolomics approach. In total, 672 metabolites were identified; of those, 357 showed differential expression (160 up-regulated versus 197 down-regulated). Metabolic pathway analysis of these differential metabolites showed a significant enrichment of the "Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis" pathway. A hierarchical cluster analysis of differential metabolites of the two species showed a clear grouping pattern in which the relative contents of five anthocyanins and four catechin derivatives differed significantly between the two groups. This study provides reference values for isolation and identification of functional compounds from wild rice and for research and development of functional foods from the two species.

AB This study investigated the relationships among UV-B radiation dose, isoflavone monomers and the oxidative-antioxidant system in germinating soybean. Results showed that the isoflavone monomers content showed a good fit to the quadratic model with UV-B radiation dose, except for aglycones. UV-B decreased phenylalanine content and up-regulated the key enzymes activities in isoflavone biosynthesis. H2O2 , electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde, T-22 and M-22 were increased, while T-23 and M-23 decreased. Microscopic analysis showed excess UV-B radiation resulted in the reduced cell volume, irregular cell shape, and increased cell space. The antioxidant enzymes activities were enhanced by UV-B. These results demonstrated that UV-B could trigger the formation of H2O2, resulting in the oxidative stress. Thus, the antioxidant system, including the enzymatic (enhanced the antioxidant enzymes activities) and nonenzymatic (accumulated isoflavones) were activated to minimize oxidative damage. This study provides theoretical basis for enhancing isoflavone monomer accumulation in plant-source foods by UV-B.

AB A highly accurate quantitative method, based on the new technique, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), was applied to determine the content of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in seafood products. Using this method, we found a linear relationship among raw sample weight, DNA concentration and DNA copy number. We also established a formula to calculate the raw sample weight, based on the number of DNA copies. To confirm the accuracy and applicability of this method, mixed samples of known composition were analyzed. Results from this study indicated that the ddPCR method described is suitable for quantifying Alaska pollock in seafood products and has the potential applied to a variety of tasks in food quality certification.

AB Food products containing lipids, especially unsaturated fatty acids, are prone to oxidation reactions, which lead to the formation of off-flavor, due to side-reaction products that potentially have toxic effects and reduce shelf-life. The Maillard reaction products (MRPs) are widely produced in foods containing reducing sugars and amino-bearing compounds during thermal processing and storage. MRPs possess excellent antioxidant ability in many food products, through chelation of metal ions, breakdown of radical chains and hydrogen peroxide, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. This review presents an overview of the antioxidant activity of MRPs in model and real food systems. It also provides the pros and cons of the Maillard reaction, some available antioxidant assays to evaluate the antioxidative ability of MRPs, and parameters influencing their functional properties. In addition, metal chelation-based antibrowning ability of MRPs to inhibit the enzymatic browning reaction in fruits and vegetables is discussed.

AB The kinetics of micellar solubilization of lipophilic micronutrients (bioaccessibility) in relation with triglyceride digestion remains poorly known. To study this interplay in real-time, a droplet microfluidic method was designed and used as reported in the first part of this article series. In this second part, the interplay between the micellar solubilization of (pro)vitamins (beta-carotene or retinyl palmitate) and the digestion of triglyceride oils (tricaprylin TC, or high-oleic sunflower seed oil HOSO, or fish oil FO) during simulated gastrointestinal digestion was investigated. The relation between the release of both micronutrients and of triglyceride lipolytic products was found to be non-linear. The kinetics of beta-carotene was found to follow the kinetics of lipolytic products, depending on the oil type (TC > HOSO > FO). The effect of the gastric phase on the intestinal phase was also found to follow this order, mostly due to partial lipolysis during the gastric phase.

AB A simple, sensitive and efficient confirmatory method was developed and validated for the determination of 16 coccidiostats in animal tissues and eggs using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS). The sample preparation consisted of a solid-liquid extraction with ACN and dispersive SPE cleanup with MgSO4 and C-18. Analysis was realized in an Acquity BEH HILIC silica column, in SRM mode. Both positive and negative ionization was performed, using polarity switching. Isocratic elution was used with a mobile phase of ACN: aqueous ammonium formate 1 mM with 0.1% formic acid (80:20, v/v). Method validation was performed in eggs, poultry, bovine, ovine, porcine and rabbit tissue and exceptionally low LODs were achieved, varying from 0.004 mu g kg(-1) (decoquinate in porcine tissue) to 0.560 mu g kg(-1) (halofuginone in eggs). The developed methodology was applied in 82 muscle and egg samples through the Greek National Residue Control Plan for coccidiostats.

AB To extend the postharvest shelf-life of green bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), an exogenous application of two polyamines, Spermidine and Putrescine (SPD-PUT), was tested in multiple combinations (10 mu M plus 10 mu M, 20 mu M plus 20 mu M, and 30 mu M plus 30 mu M) at 4 +/- 1 degrees C for 40 days. The titratable acidity, protein content, activities of catalase and peroxidase, chlorophyll and capsaicin content gradually decreased for all the treated and untreated fruits throughout the storage period. On the other hand, proline content and antioxidant 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity continuously increased with the extension of time-span under storage. Among the three treatment combinations, the combination of 20 mu M SPD and 20 mu M PUT was found to be the optimum, based on the response of all the morphological and physicochemical traits assessed. The same combination was effective in sustaining the quality of green bell pepper following its harvest, for a period of at least 40 days.

AB A novel solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) method was developed to quantify two new fungicide residuals (Y13149, Y12196) in mung bean sprouts. With a stable and biocompatible elcetrospinning nanofiber (polystyrene/graphene@silica, PS/G@SiO2) as coating, the SPME fiber was directly inserted into the stem of mung bean sprout to in-situ in-vivo sampling and extraction, followed by GC-MS analysis. Under the optimal conditions, satisfactory average recoveries of 99% and 72% were obtained for Y13149 and Y12196 with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) under 16.3%, indicating good precision and anti-matrix ability of the method. The result also exhibited low detection limit (0.06-0.08 mu g.L-1 ) and wide liner range (0.3-100 mu g.L-1 ) with the correlation coefficients (R-2) of 0.9989. The established method was applied successfully to trace the accumulation and distribution of fungicides in mung bean sprouts, and it provides a simple, rapid and reliable quantitative method for food analysis.

AB The RAW264.7 cell model was employed to screen immunomodulatory selenium-containing peptides from selenium-enriched rice protein hydrolysates (SPHs). Moreover, the selenium-containing peptides of high-activity protein hydrolysates were purified by Sephadex G-25, and identified by reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The results showed that 25 peptide sequences containing selenomethionine (SeMet) information above 90% of probability confidence were found in a fraction of alcalase hydrolysates. SeMDPGQQ and TSeMMM of 100% probability confidence were speculated as two novel selenium-containing peptide sequences. The artificially synthesized peptide TSeMMM was subsequently verified by an excellent immunomodulatory activity at a concentration of 80 mu g/mL. In conclusion, the immunomodulatory activity of SPHs was correlated to SeMet sequence in the structure of seleniumcontaining peptides, and TSeMMM with a stronger immunomodulatory activity demonstrated potential as functional food additives for improving human health.

AB A new method based on a QuEChERS extraction followed by the ultra-high liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) detection has been developed for the analysis of mycotoxin in beer. The method allows the identification and quantification of 23 mycotoxins with different chemical characteristic including regulated, emerging and masked compounds. A sample treatment procedure involving a QuEChERS extraction and dispersive solid-phase clean-up steps was applied. This protocol involves a new approach based on a sample concentration before the extraction. The method was in-house validated in terms of limits of detection (LODs), limits of quantification (LOQs), linearity, repeatability and recoveries. For most compounds, recoveries ranged from 70% to 110% with LOQs (from 0.038 to 30.43 mu g/L) lower than the maximum residue levels established in European regulations. In general, acceptable performance characteristics were obtained fulfilling the current legislation. Therefore, the proposed method is appropriate for routine analysis of beer.

AB An ultra-performance convergence chromatography (UPC2) method coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF-MS), was developed for the determination of complicated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in human milk fat. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide as the mobile phase improved the chromatographic separation of the TAGs significantly. By optimizing the scan modes of Q-TOF-MS and selecting parent ions for MS/MS ionization, the fragment ions of each TAG including TAG isomers with overlapping retention time were adequately resolved for identification and quantification. A total of 95 different TAGs were identified in the human milk samples from Chinese mother volunteers, with O-P-L representing the main TAG, followed by O-P-O and O-L-L. In addition, the compositions and contents of TAGs in different fats and oils were successfully measured. The developed method can serve as an advanced and reliable analytical tool for the determination of complicated TAGs in various biological samples.

AB In this study, to enhance the sensitivity of conventional immunochromatographic assay (ICA) two strategies including using a high sensitive label and changing the assay format, were simultaneously applied to develop an ultrasensitive format of ICA. In new format, primary monoclonal antibody against ochratoxin A (OTA) was used without any labeling, and a secondary polycolonal antibody was labeled with europium fluorescent nanoparticles (EuNPs). Detection was performed in a single step by inserting the test strip into a microtube containing all reagents. The results were obtained within 12 min and read by a portable fluorescent strip reader. Salient features of the new format of ICA compared with conventional format include: (1) A 100-fold decrease in limit of detection (LOD) due to application of two amplification strategy; (2) Reduction in expensive monoclonal antibody consumption. The established method was evaluated for the quantitative determination of OTA with LOD as low as 0.4 pg mL(-1).

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the volatile compounds of the leaves of ten perilla accessions as well as to determine total polyphenols, antioxidant capacity. Essential oil (EOs) content ranged from 0.33 to 1.75 mL/100 g d.w. in PS3 and J1 respectively. In this study sixty-five compounds were identified by GC-MS and characterized with the predominance of perillaldehyde, perilla ketone, beta-dehydro-elsholtzia ketone, limonene, shisofuran, farnesene (Z, E, alpha), beta-caryophyllene, trans-shisool. The biogenesis and composition of EOs are probably attributed to several factors. JTD3 had a significantly higher polyphenol content as well as showed the highest antioxidant capacity, whereas a strong positive linear correlation was observed between them. PS1 and NP 606 produced the maximum biomass correspondingly, while a large glandular trichome density was recorded for J1. The results support that perilla is rich in natural compounds that could be developed as nutraceuticals and/or phytomedicine.

AB Palm mid-fraction (PMF), which has a high content of symmetric POP, was converted to asymmetric PPO (APMF) via acyl migration. After solvent fractionation, the liquid phase of acyl migrated PMF (APMF-L) was obtained and blended with hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO, 50:50, w/w) to produce a fat blend (namely, an alternative fat blend) which had reduced saturated fatty acid content while having similar melting behavior to HCO. In an alternative fat blend, the major fatty acids were lauric (27.94), palmitic (26.93) and oleic (15.75 mol%) acid. The solid fat index was quite similar to that of HCO, especially at 28-44 degrees C. Nevertheless, an alternative fat blend had lower saturated fatty acid content, by 18%, compared to HCO. The content of highly atherogenic myristic acid was reduced by approximately 40%. The alternative fat blend in this study could be used as a raw material for non-dairy cream with low saturated fat content.

AB Cereal based foods are a major part of the infant diet and they can be contaminated with Solanaceae and other plants containing tropane alkaloids. This study was focused on the optimisation of an extraction procedure based on a solid-liquid method and an online SPE system, directly coupled to different mass spectrometry analysers as Orbitrap and triple quadrupole (QqQ), removing the chromatographic separation step. Total running analysis time was 15.8 min (17.3 min in the QqQ system). The developed method was validated obtaining recoveries ranging from 66 to 98% and 68-97% for the Orbitrap and QqQ respectively (RSD lower than 14.3%) and limits of quantification from 0.5 to 5 mu g kg(-1) and 0.5-10 mu g kg(-1) for the QqQ and Orbitrap analyser respectively. The validated method was applied to several cereal based baby food samples, finding a positive sample containing atropine (11.5 mu g kg(-1)), scopolamine (2.8 mu g kg(-1)) and apoatropine (7.5 mu g kg(-1)).

AB Procyanidins and cell walls were extracted from pear at ripe and overripe stages in order to investigate the impact of ripening stage on their association. Procyanidin composition and structure remained stable at the overripe stage. Mid Infrared Spectroscopy (MIR) discriminated cell wall-procyanidin complex from initial purified cell wall material (CWM). Interactions between procyanidins and CWM isolated from the whole flesh (FL), parenchyma cells (PC), stone cells (ST) and skin (SK) at ripe and overripe stage were characterized using UV-Vis spectrometry using Langmuir isotherm formulation and Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry (ITC). The affinity between procyanidins and CWM decreased as follows: PC > FL > ST > SK. The proportion of bound procyanidins increased at the overripe stage for all CWM and the maximal saturation level was obtained for overripe FL and ST. ITC indicated that associations between pear cell walls and procyanidins involved hydrogen bonds and mainly hydrophobic interactions for overripe PC.

AB Multiple mycotoxins can contaminate foods simultaneously leading to increased risks for human health. To assess exposure and health risks of 9 mycotoxins, we employed a multiple immunoaffinity column - high performance liquid chromatography method to determine their concentrations of 35 whole wheat flour and 50 refined wheat flour samples from China. The recoveries of the validated method were 75.78-118.24%, and the limits of detection and quantification were 1.5-20 and 5.0-60 mu g kg(-1), respectively. Multiple mycotoxins were detected in 37.1% of whole wheat flour and 8% of refined wheat flour. In the worst-case scenario, the hazard index was 222.69% for male and 253.97% for female with a cumulative exposure to Fusarium mycotoxins through consuming whole wheat flour, and deoxynivalenol was the main mycotoxin detected. In conclusion, whole wheat flour should be regarded with more health concern because of cumulative effects of co-occurred mycotoxins.

AB The effects of insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) on heat-induced gelation properties, such as microstructural changes and the molecular conformation of myofibrillar proteins (MP), were analyzed by image analyses and Raman spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that pure MP gelation contained a loose and dispersed network with interconnected water channels. With IDF addition, the lacunarity and the particle size of water pores both significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and fractal dimension significantly increased (P < 0.05), which indicated the formation of a homogenous and compact three-dimensional network. Through Raman spectra, IDF addition resulted in modification of amide I and III regions, by a significant decrease in alpha-helix content, accompanied by an increase of beta-sheets, beta-turns, and random coil content (P < 0.05); the intensity of CU + 005CH stretching vibrations bending vibrations bands were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Principal component analyses showed significant correlations between textual property, microstructure and molecular conformations. Cluster analyses indicated IDF improved the functionality of MP gel by 1): IDF stable the moisture phase 2) "concentrated" MP promoted structural integrity and compact gelation.

AB Top-K High Utility Itemset (HUI) mining problem offers greater flexibility to a decision maker in specifying her/his notion of item utility and the desired number of patterns. It obviates the need for a decision maker to determine an appropriate minimum utility threshold value using a trial-and-error process. The top-k HUI mining problem, however, is more challenging and requires use of effective threshold raising strategies. Several threshold raising strategies have been proposed in the literature to improve the overall efficiency of mining top-k HUIS. This paper advances the state-of-the-art and presents a new Top-K HUI method (THUI). A novel Leaf Itemset Utility (LIU) structure and a threshold raising strategy is proposed to significantly improve the efficiency of mining top-k HUIs. A new utility lower bound estimation method is also introduced to quickly raise the minimum utility threshold value. The proposed THUI method is experimentally evaluated on several benchmark datasets and compared against two state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed THUI method offers one to three orders of magnitude runtime performance improvement over other related methods in the literature, especially on large, dense and long average transaction length datasets. In addition, the memory requirements of the proposed method are found to be lower. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fractionation of beta-lactoglubulin (beta-lg) and alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-l alpha) using conventional separation technologies remains challenging mainly due to similar molecular weight. Herein, casein (CN) was used as ligand protein to specifically aggregate beta-lg under high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) in order to separate alpha-l alpha after acidification to pH 4.6. Specifically, we studied the effect of different concentration of CN on alpha-l alpha purity and recovery. Model solutions of alpha-l alpha, beta-lg and CN (from 0 to 5 mg/mL) were pressurized (600 MPa-5 min). After acidification and centrifugation of pressure-treated solutions, purity of alpha-l alpha was increased up to 78% with a recovery of 88% for solution without CN. In contrast with our initial hypothesis, the presence of CN decreased beta-lg pressure-induced aggregation and co-precipitation upon acidification and significantly reduced purity (similar to 71%). Therefore, our results suggest a chaperone-like activity of CN on beta-lg pressure-induced aggregation which needs further investigation.

AB A rapid ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-APCI-MS/MS) method was developed for the analysis of vitamin K compounds: phylloquinone (PK) and menaquinones (MK-n). Non-chlorinated mobile phase composition was optimized for separation of eight vitamin K compounds on a reversed phase column in 10 min. Sample treatment with liquid and solid phase extractions and by the use of MK-4 as an internal standard enabled the quantitation of microgram level of vitamin K compounds in food. The method was used to screen and quantitate vitamin K from 17 fermented food products. The highest amount of PK was detected in kimchi (42 mu g/100 g), whereas the highest MK-7 content was detected in natto (902 mu g/100 g). Some MK-9 was present in kefir (5 mu g/100 g). Two Chinese fermented soybean pastes contained significant amount of MK-6 (5-36 mu g/100 g), MK-7 (12-86 mu g/100 g), and MK-8 (22-44 mu g/100 g).

AB Salmonella vaccine strategies for food-producing animals have typically focused on a specific serovar that either causes production losses due to morbidity/mortality or is an important food safety pathogen for a particular food commodity. The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium BBS 866 vaccine strain was designed to reduce serovar specificity to provide cross-protection against diverse Salmonella serovars, thereby broadening its applicability for multiple animal and poultry species. We reported cross-protection of the BBS 866 vaccine in swine [Vaccine 34:1241-6]. In the current study, we extend the efficacy of the Salmonella vaccine to a poultry commodity by revealing significant reduction of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg colonization of the cecum and systemic dissemination to the spleen in BBS 866-vaccinated turkeys. Transcriptional analysis of whole blood from BBS 866-vaccinated turkeys revealed down-regulation of metabolic and immune genes (KCNAB1, ACOD1, GPR17, ADOR2AB, and IL-17RD), suggesting limited leukocyte activation without an overt peripheral inflammatory response to vaccination.

AB Background: Seasonal influenza has a major individual and collective impact, especially among the elderly living in nursing homes. To prevent infection by influenza viruses, vaccination of residents and professionals is an essential measure. However, while the vaccination rates of residents are generally high (>85%), rates among professionals are generally approximately 20%. To evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention campaign on the improvement of the influenza vaccination rate of professionals, a regional intervention study was proposed for nursing homes during the 2014-15 season.
   Methods: Cluster-randomized controlled trial (with a nursing home representing a cluster). In the intervention group, a campaign on influenza vaccination was offered to staff, combining different teaching aids in a multimodal approach. In the control group, no intervention was proposed. The primary endpoint was the rate of influenza vaccination among staff. Before and after the study, professionals were asked to complete short questionnaires on their perceptions of influenza vaccination. A multilevel analysis was carried out to compare the vaccination rates between the 2 groups and their evolution before/after the winter period.
   Results: A total of 32 nursing homes were randomized, and 6 were excluded. Initial vaccination rates were 27.6% in the intervention group and 24.2% in the control group (p = 0.16). After the study, these rates increased to 33.7% and 22.9%, respectively, which was a relative difference of +22.1% in the intervention group compared to -5.4% in the control group, p = 0.0025.
   Conclusions: Despite professionals' reluctance to be vaccinate, participation in a promotional campaign with a pragmatic approach has increased the rate of influenza vaccination. The approach will be offered to all nursing homes in the region after revision of the tools to enhance their ease of use and pedagogical messages focused on the direct benefits to professionals.

AB This study demonstrates that route and viral vector can significantly influence the innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and dendritic cells (DC) recruited to the vaccination site, 24 h post delivery. Intranasal (i.n.) vaccination induced ST2/IL-33R(+ )ILC2, whilst intramuscular (i.m.) induced IL-25R(+) and TSLPR+ (Thymic stromal lymphopoietin protein receptor) ILC2 subsets. However, in muscle a novel ILC subset devoid of the known ILC2 markers (IL-25R(-) IL-33R(-) TSLPR-) were found to express IL-13, unlike in lung. Different viral vectors also influenced the ILC-derived cytokines and the DC profiles at the respective vaccination sites. Both i.n. and i.m. recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV) priming, which has been associated with induction of high avidity T cells and effective antibody differentiation exhibited low ILC2-derived IL-13, high NKp46(+) ILC1 /ILC3 derived-IFN-gamma and no IL-17A, together with enhanced CD11b(+) CD103(-) conventional DCs (cDC). In contrast, recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara (rMVA) and Influenza A vector priming, which has been linked to low avidity T cells, induced opposing ILC derived-cytokine profiles and enhanced cross-presenting DCs. These observations suggested that the former ILC/DC profiles could be a predictor of a balanced cellular and humoral immune outcome. In addition, following i.n. delivery Rhinovirus (RV) and Adenovius type 5 (Ad5) vectors that induced elevated ILC2-derived IL-13, NKp46(+) ILC1/ILC3-derived-IFN-gamma and no IL-17A, predominantly recruited CD11b(-) B220(+) plasmacytoid DCs (pDC). Knowing that pDC are involved in antibody differentiation, we postulate that i.n. priming with these vectors may favour induction of effective humoral immunity. Our data also revealed that vector-specific replication status and/or presence or absence of immune evasive genes can significantly alter the ILC and DC activity. Collectively, our findings suggest that understanding the route- and vector-specific ILC and DC profiles at the vaccination site may help tailor/design more efficacious viral vector-based vaccines, according to the pathogen of interest.

The use of quality measures can provide incentives for increased utilization of preventive services. To address the lack of adult immunization measures, the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit, a coalition of adult immunization partners led by the Immunization Action Coalition, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Vaccine Program Office, spearheaded efforts to (1) identify gaps and priorities in adult immunization quality performance measurement; (2) explore feasibility of data collection on adult immunizations through pilot testing and engaging stakeholders; and (3) develop and test quality measure specifications. This paper outlines the process by which a public-private partnership drove the development of two adult immunization performance measures-an adult immunization status measure for influenza, tetanus and diphtheria (Td) and/or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), herpes zoster and pneumococcal vaccines, and a prenatal immunization status measure for influenza and Tdap vaccinations in pregnant women. These measures have recently been added to the 2019 Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS (R)), a widely used set of performance measures reportable by private health plans.

AB Background: Influenza vaccines are important for prevention of influenza-associated hospitalization. However, the effectiveness of influenza vaccines can vary by year and influenza type and subtype and mechanisms underlying this variation are incompletely understood. Assessments of serologic correlates of protection can support interpretation of influenza vaccine effectiveness in hospitalized populations.
   Methods: We enrolled adults hospitalized for treatment of acute respiratory illnesses during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 influenza seasons whose symptoms began <10 days prior to enrollment. Influenza infection status was determined by RT-PCR. Influenza vaccination status was defined by selfreport and medical record/registry documentation. Serum specimens collected at hospital admission were tested in hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) and neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) assays. We evaluated how well antibody measured in these specimens represented pre-infection immune status, and measured associations between antibody and influenza vaccination and infection.
   Results: Serum specimens were retrieved for 315 participants enrolled during the 2014-2015 season and 339 participants during the 2015-2016 season. Specimens were collected within 3 days of illness onset from 65% of participants. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) did not vary by the number of days from illness onset to specimen collection among influenza positive participants suggesting that measured antibody was representative of pre-infection immune status rather than a de novo response to infection. In both seasons, vaccinated participants had higher HAI and NAI GMTs than unvaccinated. HAI titers against the 2014-2015 A(H3N2) vaccine strain did not correlate with protection from infection with antigenically-drifted A(H3N2) viruses that circulated that season. In contrast, higher HAI titers against the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain were associated with reduced odds of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in 2015-2016.
   Conclusions: Serum collected shortly after illness onset at hospital admission can be used to assess correlates of protection against influenza infection. Broader implementation of similar studies would provide an opportunity to understand the successes and shortcomings of current influenza vaccines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Influenza causes significant morbidity among young children, and vaccination remains the best strategy to prevent disease. Understanding factors influencing early influenza vaccination uptake are important to identify strategies to increase vaccination rates.
   Objective: To assess maternal and neonatal factors associated with influenza vaccination among firstborn children within the first two years of life.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study linking Colorado Birth Registry data and state immunization data of all live births between 2008 and 2016. The cohort was limited to singleton, first births. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations between maternal and neonatal factors and influenza vaccination.
   Results: Among 126,763 births meeting criteria for inclusion, 50.2% were vaccinated against influenza by two years of age. Mothers of unvaccinated children were older (27 vs 26 years, p < 0.0001), married (67.8% vs 66.8%, p < 0.0001), with a college education (38.8% vs 37.2%, p < 0.0001). Influenza vaccination rates declined over time by birth year (30.5% in 2009 vs 6.8% in 2013, p < 0.0001). Children admitted to the NICU receiving oxygen with 72 h of birth were 20% less likely to be vaccinated (RR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.670.96) after adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education and preterm birth. Conversely, premature births were associated with an increase in influenza vaccination by age two years (RR 1.1, 95%Cl: 1.05, 1.15).
   Conclusions: Among a large population based cohort of mother-infant pairs in Colorado using birth and immunization registry data, there were statistically significant differences in maternal factors between unvaccinated and vaccinated children with influenza in the first 2 years of life, but the differences were too small to be clinically significant. Children admitted to the NICU were 20% less likely to be vaccinated, highlighting the need to target influenza vaccination in this population once eligible. Ongoing studies are needed to explore factors associated with early influenza vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Commercial and regulatory limitations associated with native porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccines formulated with Freund's adjuvants may be overcome by developing effective recombinant ZP vaccines (reZP) and identifying alternative adjuvant formulations. A two-part preparatory study used 15 geldings and identified potentially effective alternative adjuvant formulations based on anti-pZP antibody response following treatment with pZP formulated with Addavax (AddaVax (TM), Invivogen), Quil A (Quil-A (R) Adjuvant, Invivogen), Quil A and Poly (I:C) (HMW VacciGrade (TM), Invivogen), Pet Gel A (Montanid (TM) Pet Gel A, Seppic) and Pet Gel A and Poly (I:C). Injection site reactions, rectal temperature and respiratory and heart rates were also monitored for three days post-treatment. Suitable anti-pZP antibody titres were seen in response to Pet Gel A and Pet Gel A and Poly (I:C). Subsequently in 31 mares, following administration of pZP, reZP and a combination of pZP and reZP proteins prepared in Pet Gel A and Poly (I:C), both serum anti-pZP and -reZP antibody responses were monitored. In addition, safety was assessed for up to seven days post-treatment by inspection and palpation of gluteal intramuscular injection sites and measurement of rectal temperature. The measured antibody titres in all treatment groups differed significantly to an adjuvant control group (P < 0.001). Temporal changes in both anti-pZP and -reZP antibody titres in all ZP treatment groups were similar to patterns reported previously in various species vaccinated with pZP formulated with Freund's adjuvants. There were no differences in anti-pZP antibody titres between the pZP and reZP treated groups (P > 0.05). Side effects were mild and transient in nature. This represents the first application of a reZP vaccine formulated with non-Freund's adjuvants evoking a similar antibody titre response to native pZP vaccination in mares. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

   intervention

DT Article
DE Human papillomavirus; Adolescent; Vaccines; Provider recommendation;
   Health communication
ID RECOMMENDATION
AB Objective: To assess secondary, parent-reported outcomes from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a provider communication intervention aimed at improving adolescent HPV vaccination.
   Methods: A paper survey was provided to a random sample of 777 parents of adolescents from 8 control and 8 intervention clinics participating in the larger trial. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests assessed associations between study arm and providers' HPV vaccine communication strategies, parents' vaccination attitudes and parent's HPV vaccine acceptance. Exploratory analyses assessed the association between receipt of 'very strong' or presumptive HPV vaccine recommendation (regardless of study arm) and parent's perceptions about their providers' vaccine communication, and parents' attitudes and acceptance of the HPV vaccine.
   Results: The response rate was 47%. There were no differences between study arms in parents' report of how their provider communicated about the HPV vaccine, parent vaccination attitudes, or uptake of the HPV vaccine. Receipt of a 'very strong' recommendation was associated with greater perceived urgency for getting vaccinated, greater trust in the information received from the provider, decreased vaccine hesitancy, and increased vaccine receipt. Receipt of a presumptive recommendation was associated with a lower likelihood of having concerns about the vaccine's safety, lower vaccine hesitancy, and an increased likelihood of vaccination. Neither recommendation strategy appeared to negatively impact parents' visit experience or trust in the information being provided. Similar results were found in sub-analyses of vaccine hesitant parents.
   Conclusions: Providing very strong, presumptive HPV vaccine recommendations is associated with improved parent vaccination attitudes and acceptance, and does not seem to have significant negative impacts, even among parents who are vaccine hesitant. Response bias in our sample could explain why there were no reported differences between study arms in parents' reports of how their adolescent's providers communicated about the HPV vaccine.

AB Background: The immunomodulatory effects of statins on vaccine response remain uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if atorvastatin enhances pneumococcal-specific antibody titer following 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination.
   Methods: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center randomized clinical trial entitled StatVax. Subjects were enrolled between June and July 2014 and followed up through September 2014. 33 healthy volunteers signed informed consent after volunteer sampling. 11 participants were excluded; 22 healthy volunteers without prior pneumococcal vaccination were enrolled and completed the study. Participants were randomized to receive a 28-day course of 40 mg atorvastatin (n = 12) or matching lactose placebo (n = 10). On day 7 of treatment, Pneumovax 23 was administered intramuscularly. The primary outcome was fold change in total pneumococcal-specific antibody titer determined by a ratio of post-vaccination titer over baseline titer. Secondary outcomes included serotype-specific pneumococcal antibody titer, seroconversion, complete blood counts (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum cytokine analysis.
   Results: Of the 22 randomized patients (mean age, 23.86; SD, 4.121; 11 women [50%]), 22 completed the trial. Total anti-pneumococcal antibody titer in the atorvastatin group went from a baseline mean of 32.58 (SD, 15.96) to 147.7 (SD, 71.52) mu g/mL at 21 days post-vaccination while titer in the placebo group went from a mean of 30.81 (SD, 13.04) to 104.4 (SD, 45) mu g/mL. When comparing fold change between treatment groups, there was a significant increase in fold change of total anti-pneumococcal antibody titer in the atorvastatin group compared to the placebo group (2-way ANOVA, p = .0177).
   Conclusions: Atorvastatin enhances antigen-specific primary humoral immune response to a T cell-independent pneumonia vaccination. Pending confirmation by larger cohort studies of target populations, peri-vaccination conventional doses of statins can become a novel adjuvant for poorl-yimmunogenic polysaccharide-based vaccines.

ID POPULATION-BASED COHORT; UNITED-STATES; MULTICOLLINEARITY; DATALINK;
   EXPOSURE
AB Background: Summary measures such as number of vaccine antigens, number of vaccines, and vaccine aluminum exposure by the 2nd birth day are directly related to parents' concerns that children receive too many vaccines over a brief period. High correlation among summary measures could cause problems in regression models that examine their associations with outcomes.
   Objectives: To evaluate the performance of multiple regression models using summary measures as risk factors to simulated binary outcomes.
   Methods: We calculated summary measures for a cohort of 232,627 children born between 1/1/2003 and 9/31/2013. Correlation and variance inflation factors (VIFs) were calculated. We conducted simulations (1) to examine the extent to which an association can be detected using a summary measure other than the true risk factor; (2) to evaluate the performance of multiple regression models including true and redundant risk factors; (3) to evaluate the performance of multiple regression models when all three were risk factors; (4) to examine the performance of multiple regression models with incorrect relationship between risk factors and outcome.
   Results: These summary measures were highly correlated. VIFs were 7.14, 6.25 and 2.17 for number of vaccine antigens, number of vaccines, and vaccine aluminum exposure, respectively. In simulations, an association would be detected if a summary measure other than the true risk factor was used. The power to detect the association between the true risk factor and outcome significantly decreased if redundant risk factors were included. When all three were risk factors, multiple regression model was appropriate to detect the stronger risk factor. Correctly specifying the relationship between risk factors and the outcome was crucial.
   Conclusions: Multiple regression models can be used to examine the association between summary measures and outcome despite of high correlation among summary measures.

TI Needle-free delivery of influenza vaccine using the Med-Jet (R) H4 is

AB Background: Needle-free vaccine delivery systems have many potential advantages including increased vaccine compliance and decreased risk of needlestick injuries and syringe reuse. The Med-Jet (R) H4 is a gas-powered, auto-disabling disposable syringe jet injector. The Med-Jet family of products are currently being used in dermatology, podiatry, pain management and veterinary practices. The objectives of this study were to assess patient attitudes, time-efficiency, safety and immunogenicity of the seasonal influenza vaccine delivered by Med-Jet compared to the traditional needle-and-syringe.
   Methods: A total of 80 patients were randomized 2:1:1 to receive a commercial trivalent vaccine by Med-Jet or needle injection from a single-dose or multi-dose vial. Patient attitudes were assessed pre-randomization and post-immunization. Safety data were collected for 21 days post-immunization. Efficiency of vaccine administration was measured through a time-and-motion study. Humoral and cellular responses were assessed on Days 0 and 21.
   Results: Overall, the participants readily accepted Med-Jet vaccination despite greater frequency of transient local reactions (eg: redness, swelling) immediately following immunization. Vaccine administration took slightly longer with the Med-Jet, but this difference decreased over time. Geometric mean hemag-glutination inhibition titers, seroconversion and seroprotection rates in the Med-Jet and needle groups were equivalent for all influenza strains in the vaccine. Microneutralization responses were also essentially identical. There were no significant differences between the groups in the frequency of functional CD4 + T cells, memory subset distribution or poly-functionality.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that the Med-Jet is an acceptable means of delivering seasonal influenza vaccine. The system was attractive to subjects, rapidly learned by skilled vaccine nurses and elicited both humoral and cellular responses that were indistinguishable from those elicited with needle injection. While other studies have assessed the humoral response to jet injection of influenza vaccine, to our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the cellular aspect of this response.

AB Proliferative enteropathy, caused by Lawsonia intracellularis, represents a threat for swine industry. Current vaccines are effective but difficult to obtain and scaled up, because of demanding bacterial culture conditions. In this work, a subunit vaccine candidate against L intracellularis was developed and its efficacy was evaluated in vivo, alone or co-formulated with pig recombinant IFN-alpha.
   The vaccine formulation contains three chimeric antigens: two outer membrane proteins and a secreted one, which were engineered by adding T epitopes using bioinformatics tools. After simultaneously expressing the three antigens in E. coli, its immunogenicity was tested in mice and pigs. Antigens co-formulated with porcine IFN-alpha were also assayed in the last species. Immune response was assessed by ELISA and qPCR, and histopathological studies of intestinal epithelial tissue were performed after challenge.
   Mice and pigs showed an increased IgG response against chimeric antigens. Particularly, there were significant differences in the antibody response when porcine IFN-alpha was co-administrated with L intracellularis antigens. Besides, mRNAs from il12 and cd4 marker were detected during the first week after immunization of pigs, suggesting a Th1-type cellular immune response. The significant enhancement of oast gene expression indicates the effect exerted by porcine IFN-alpha. Post-mortem histopathological analysis post-challenge revealed damage only into epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract from animals of the negative control group. Injuries were related to atrophy of the intestinal villi, where a decrease of globet cells and a greater migration of lymphocytes were observed.
   Overall, our results demonstrated that the vaccine candidate elicited significant humoral and cellular immune responses. Besides, histopathological analysis suggested that vaccinated animals were protected against experimental L. intracellularis infection. This research constitutes a step forward to the generation of the first recombinant chimeric vaccine against L. intracellularis, representing a faster, easier and cost effective approach to counteract the porcine proliferative enteropathy.

AB Background: Interpretation of the responses to the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax (R) 23, PPV) has proven challenging. In addition, there are few studies documenting the longevity of these responses.
   Methods: The age-specific PPV IgM, IgA, IgG and IgG2 concentrations were determined pre, 4-6 weeks and 6 years post-vaccination in the serum of Prevnar (R)-naive adults using VaccZyme (TM) pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide ELISAs.
   Results: The median pre-vaccination concentrations were; PPV IgM 53 U/mL (5-95% CI: 16-169 U/mL), IgA 23 U/mL (6-103 U/mL), IgG 41 mg/L (10-184 U/mL) and IgG2 18 mg/L (3-95 U/mL). 4-6 weeks post-vaccination there was a median 6-fold (5-95% CI: 2-24) increase in PPV IgM (median 315 U/mL (5-95% CI: 60-1133 U/mL), 18-fold (4-74) increase in IgA (369 U/mL (78-1802 U/mL)), 9-fold (2-19) increase in IgG (375 mg/L (77-1238 mg/L)) and 8-fold (1-20) increase in IgG2 (141 mg/L (25-573 mg/ L)). This was significant for all isotypes in all age ranges (p < 0.0001). Six years post-vaccination median PPV concentrations were; IgM 54 U/mL (17-128), IgA 85 U/mL (19-279), IgG 148 mg/L (30-997) and IgG2 57 mg/L (9-437). The median concentrations for all ages 6 years post-vaccination were significantly elevated compared to the pre-vaccination titres for PPV IgA, IgG and IgG2 isotypes only. The PPV IgM and IgA responses were influenced by age. At 6 years post vaccination, in individuals with normal PPV IgG, 34 individuals had PPV IgM and/or IgA concentrations below the lower limit of the healthy adult ranges. We also used the healthy adult reference ranges developed in this study to assess a cohort of primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients.
   Conclusion: These ranges will help to provide a framework for assessment and definition of normal response to PPV, which will facilitate clinical interpretation of a deficient polysaccharide response in those suspected of antibody deficiency. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Avian influenza in poultry continues to be a great concern worldwide, and the currently licensed inactivated influenza vaccines are not effective against the novel strains of influenza virus that continue to emerge in the field. This warrants the development of more broadly protective influenza vaccines or vaccination regimens. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) and subunit vaccines derived from viral peptides, such as the highly conserved ectodomain of influenza virus matrix protein 2 (M2e), can offer a more broadly reactive immune response. In chickens, we previously showed that a chimeric norovirus P particle containing M2e (M2eP) could provide partial but broad immunity, when administered as a standalone vaccine, and also enhanced the protective efficacy of inactivated vaccine when used in a combination regimen. We also demonstrated that a naturally-selected NS1-truncated H7N3 LAIV (pc4-LAIV) was highly efficacious against antigenically distant heterologous H7N2 low pathogenicity avian influenza virus challenge, especially when used as the priming vaccine in a prime-boost vaccination regimen. In this study, we investigated the cross-subtype protective efficacy of pc4-LAIV in conjunction with M2eP using single vaccination, combined treatment, and prime-boost approaches. Chickens vaccinated with pc4-LAIV showed significant reduction of tracheal shedding of a low pathogenicity H5N2 challenge virus. This cross-subtype protective efficacy was further enhanced, during the initial stages of challenge virus replication, in chickens that received a vaccination regimen consisting of priming with pc4-LAIV at 1 day of age and boosting with M2eP. Further, H5N2-specific serum IgG and pc4-LAIV-specific hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers were enhanced in LAIV-primed and M2eP boostvaccinated chickens. Taken together, our data point to the need of further investigation into the benefits of combined and prime-boost vaccination schemes utilizing LAIV and epitope-based vaccines, to develop more broadly protective vaccination regimens.

AB Background: Poland introduced the 10-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV10) into the childhood immunization program in January 2017. During previous decades, considerable changes had occurred in the surveillance system for invasive pneumococcal disease. Therefore, to provide baseline data on pneumococcal diseases before PCV10 introduction, we evaluated the epidemiology of pneumococcal meningitis (PM), the only syndrome monitored consistently since 1970.
   Methods: Based on laboratory-confirmed cases reported during 2005-2015, we calculated the reported rates, serotypes distribution and antimicrobial resistance of pneumococcal meningitis isolates. Data from the mandatory national surveillance system was linked with data on cerebrospinal fluid isolates submitted to the National Reference Centre for Bacterial Meningitis. We used negative binomial regression with Newey West method to test for trend in rates of pneumococcal meningitis notified during 2005-2015 and Chi-squared test to assess changes in the serotype distribution from 2008-2011 to 2012-2015.
   Results: From 2005 to 2015, the overall reported incidence of PM increased from 0.21 to 0.47 cases per 100,000 population, average yearly increase of 7% (rate ratio 1.07; 95% CI 1.06-1.08). The increase was primarily due to annual increase of 3% (1.02-1.05) among 15-49 years of age, 12% (95% CI: 1.10-1.13) among 50-64 years of age, 18% (95% CI: 1.16-1.19) among persons 65-74 years of age and 9% (95% CI 1.07-1.10) among persons >= 75 years of age. In children <5 years of age, serotypes included in PCV10 and PCV13 accounted for 75% and 80% of reported isolates, respectively. From 2008-2011 to 2012-2015, the proportion of PM cases caused by PCV10 serotypes decreased from 52% to 41% (p < 0.01). Overall, 28% of isolates were resistant to penicillin and 13% were non-susceptible to cefotaxime.
   Conclusions: The introduction of PCV10 into national immunization program may have considerable impact on disease burden, especially on number of cases caused by isolates non-susceptible to antimicrobials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Vesicular phospholipid gels as drug delivery systems for small molecular

AB Lipid-based drug delivery has been investigated for a long time when it comes to liposomes and solid-lipid implants or solid-lipid nanoparticles. The promising, characteristic properties of these systems have led to the development of newer lipid-based drug delivery systems for the sustained release of drugs like liposomes for sustained delivery of substances, DepoFoam (TM) technology, phospholipid-based phase separation gels and vesicular phospholipid gels. Vesicular phospholipid gels (VPGs) are highly concentrated, viscous dispersions of high amounts of phospholipids in aqueous drug solution. The easy, solvent-free manufacturing process, high biocompatibility and various applications, as depot formulation for the sustained delivery of drugs and as a storage form of small unilamellar vesicles make VPGs highly attractive as drug carriers. Over the last years, the solvent free preparation process has advanced from high pressure homogenization to dual centrifugation (DC). Thereby a very simple one step process has been established for the preparation of VPGs. The semisolid VPG was first described in 1997 by Brandl et al. Since then, many formulations have been developed, encapsulating small molecular weight drugs like 5-FU (2003), cetrorelix (2005), cytarabine (2012) and exenatide (2015). In 2010, the first pharmaceutical protein, erythropoietin, was encapsulated in VPGs and sustained release of the substance was shown in vitro. In 2015, G-CSF was encapsulated in VPGs and tested in vivo for rotator cuff repair in a rat model and for PEGylated IFN-beta-1b sustained release from vesicular phospholipid gels was demonstrated in vitro. Further, a very elegant administration technique for VPGs via needle-free injection was established. However this promising drug delivery system does still leave space for improvement and optimization.
   This review summarizes information about lipid-based depot systems in general and focuses on the historical development of VPGs. It emphasizes the advantages and drawbacks of VPGs as drug delivery device. Additionally, novel preparation methods and applications of VPGs will be discussed. A focus will be set on delivery of pharmaceutical proteins and peptides.

AB Modification of recombinant proteins with polyethylene-glycol (PEG) can improve their pharmacokinetic properties, although their bioactivity may be reduced after PEGylation due to structural changes. In this study, simultaneous optimization of PEGylation efficiency and preserved bioactivity of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) was investigated. In this regard, experiments were designed by the response surface methodology (RSM)-central composite design (CCD) utilizing design expert software. Under the obtained optimum conditions of 6.73 molar ratio of PEG to protein and pH 7.71 as the main factors affect the process, 54% PEGylation efficiency and 63% preserved bioactivity can be achieved. Based on the ANOVA table, model F-values equal to 31.16 and 20.8 for PEGylation efficiency and preserved bioactivity, respectively, demonstrated the validity and importance of the models. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gel electrophorese analyses verified the purity of the PEGylated form of rhGH. Findings showed that the modified protein would be stable for six months at 4 degrees C. In vitro cell growth assessments revealed Nb2-11 cell proliferation during 48 h, although proliferation rate decrease with the increase of PEGylated rhGH concentration. Half-life prolongation in serum observed for PEGylated form in comparison with the non-modified one on in vivo. In overall, the results are promising for the utilization of the PEGylated form of rhGH for the treatment of human growth deficiency after further investigations.

ID ACTIVATED DRY GRANULATION; WET GRANULATION; HIGH-SHEAR; BINDER
AB The Green fluidized bed granulation (GFBG) technology is based on the moisture activated dry granulation (MADG) technique and consists only of a mixing and a spraying process using a fluidized bed granulator, requiring no heating process. This provides a less energy-consuming and environment-friendly granulation method compared to current fluidized bed granulation (FBG) and high-shear granulation (HSG) methods. The aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the manufacturability, and granule and tablet properties among GFBG, MADG, FBG and HSG.
   The GFBG process time took less than 20 min for producing final blends at a 700 g scale, which was comparable to MADG. This process time was significantly shorter than that of FBG and HSG. GFBG not only had the shortest process time but also reduced the number of manufacturing machines compared to FBG and HSG.
   The Hausner ratio (HR) of granules from GFBG (1.30) indicated a good flowability, and no problems were observed in the tablet mass variability during compression.
   Tablets produced using GFBG achieved sufficient tensile strength ( > 1.5 MPa) even at a low compression force and demonstrated the fastest disintegration time compared to the other manufacturing methods. Tablet disintegration is related to wettability and porosity, therefore the tablet wettability (initial and capillary wetting) and tablet porosity were investigated. As a result, the capillary wetting of the tablets produced using GFBG was 3.6 times higher than the tablets produced using FBG, which might have affected the fast disintegration of the tablets produced using GFBG.

AB Emodin (EM), an anthraquinone obtained from natural products, is known for many pharmacological activities. However, further evaluation and interpretation of toxicity or pharmacological activity of emodin are limited due to its poor aqueous solubility. We aimed to identify an emodin cocrystal with improved pharmaceutical properties. Among various compounds screened by thermal analysis, nicotinamide (NCT) was identified as a potential cocrystal coformer, based on the presence of an exothermal peak in DSC profiles of the physical mixture of EM and NCT. Crystallization of EM-NCT cocrystal (EM-NCT) using slow or rapid solvent evaporation method yielded a novel cocrystal at 1:2 ratio. Single crystal structure analysis revealed EM dimers and NCT tetramers connected alternatively via H-bonds to make one-dimensional chains which are joined by inter-chain H-bonds between NCT to form two-dimensional layers. The EM molecules are planar with intramolecular H-bonds between O atoms. Compared with EM, the EM-NCT cocrystal showed improved aqueous solubility, dissolution rate, and stability. Hence, EM-NCT cocrystal is proposed as a more suitable solid form for further development as pharmaceutical products.

AB Atenolol is a drug widely used for the treatment of hypertension. However, the great drawback it presents is a low bioavailability after oral administration. To obtain formulations that allow to improve the bioavailability of this drug is a challenge for the pharmaceutical technology. The objective of this work was to increase the rate and extent of intestinal absorption of atenolol as model of a low permeability drug, developing a double technology strategy. To increase atenolol permeability an ion pair with brilliant blue was designed and the sustained release achieved through encapsulation in polymeric nanoparticles (NPs). The in vitro release studies showed a pH-dependent release from NPs, (particle size 437.30 +/- 8.92) with a suitable release profile of drug (atenolol) and counter ion (brilliant blue) under intestinal conditions. Moreover, with the in vivo assays, a significant increase (2-fold) of atenolol bioavailability after administering the ion-pair NPs by oral route was observed. In conclusion, the combination of ion-pair plus polymeric NPs have proved to be a simple and very useful approach to achieve a controlled release and to increase the bioavailability of a low permeability charged drugs.

AB Filomicelles (worm-like micelles) possess high drug loading capacity and long circulation time in the bloodstream. A novel approach can be filomicelles with folic acid (FA) as a targeting moiety. Folate-drug delivery systems can target FA receptors (FAR) that are overexpressed in several human carcinomas, which can potentially maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. The aim of this study was to develop filomicelles from combination of poly(L-lactide)-Jeffamine-folic acid and poly(L-lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol) for delivery of betulin derivative. Phosphate derivative of betulin reveals high cytotoxicity against cancer cells, however its application is restricted due to poor solubility in water. Incorporation into hydrophobic core of micelles can effectively solubilize the drug. Three kinds of micelles were obtained with high drug loading capacity. Based on TEM analysis, the copolymers formed exclusively filomicelles or mixture of filomicelles and spherical micelles. All kinds of micelles provided release of betulin derivative for over 9 days and apart the very initial phase displayed similar release profile. The influence of PLA block on initial burst effect was revealed. The in vitro cytotoxicity of betulin derivative loaded micelles against FAR-positive HeLa cells was confirmed, which proves their usefulness for targeted delivery of cytostatic drug.

AB Diltiazem hydrochloride, topically applied at 2% concentration, is considered effective for the treatment of chronic anal fissures, although it involves several side effects among which anal pruritus and postural hypotension. To test the hypothesis that a sustained delivery system of diltiazem hydrochloride may be helpful for the treatment of chronic anal fissures, in the present study we evaluated the potential of gels containing diltiazem hydrochloride entrapped in microsponges. Such microsponges were based on Eudragit RS 100 and the effect of some formulation variables was assessed by a 2(3) full factorial screening design. An optimized formulation of diltiazem hydrochloride microsponges was dispersed in Methylcellulose 2% or Poloxamer 407 20% and the resulting gels (micro-l-diltiazem hydrochloride 2%) were subjected to in vitro drug release, ex vivo permeability and drug deposition after application on porcine rectal mucosa. The results showed a prolonged release up to 24 h from micro-l-diltiazem hydrochloride at 2% in the gels. The permeation tests revealed up to 18% higher drug retention on the mucosal tissue after 24 h by the micro-l-diltiazem hydrochloride 2% gels compared to conventional diltiazem hydrochloride gels at 2%. These results suggest that diltiazem hydrochloride-loaded microsponges dispersed in rectal gels may be useful to overcome some limitations of conventional local chronic anal fissure therapy.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) owns huge surface area and high drug loading capacity for aromatic molecules, such as doxorubicin (DOX). However, its biocompatibility is poor and it might agglomerate in physiological conditions. Chemical modification of GO with hydrophilic polymer, especially PEGylation, was a common method to improve its biocompatibility. But the chemical modification of GO was complicated, and its drug loading capacity might be reduced because of the occupation of its functional groups. In this study, DOX-PEG polymers with different PEG molecular weights were synthesized to modify nano graphene oxide (NGO) to simultaneously realize the solubilization of NGO and the high loading capacity of DOX. The result showed that the drug release of NGO@DOX-PEG was pH sensitive. NIR irradiation could augment the drug release, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity and nuclear translocation of nanodrugs. Among the three kinds of nanodrugs, NGO@DOX-PEG5K was superior to others. It suggested that after conjugating with PEG, the bond between DOX-PEG and NGO was weakened, which resulted in a better drug release and treatment effect. In summary, the NIR and pH dual-responsive NGO@DOX-PEG nanodrugs were developed by noncovalent modification, and it demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and photochemical therapeutic effect, presenting a promising candidate for antitumor therapy, especially NGO@DOX-PEG5K.

AB Drug resistance and recurrence are the main clinical challenges in chemotherapy of lymphoma. Methotrexate (MTX), especially high dose MTX (HD MTX), is extensively used to treat some aggressive subtypes of lymphoma, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, in order to overcome drug resistance. But poor solubility of the free drug and severe side effects of HD MTX limit its clinical application. Polymeric micelle, as an ideal nano delivery system, provides effective solutions to these problems. In this work, monomethyl poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (e-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) was employed to load MTX through a one-step solid dispersion method. MTX loaded micelles had a small particle size of 25.64 +/- 0.99 nm and polydisperse index (PDI) of 0.176 +/- 0.05. Drug loading and encapsulation efficiency of MTX loaded micelles were 5.57 +/- 0.14% and 92.46 +/- 2.38%. Compared with free MTX, MTX loaded micelles demonstrated a much slower and sustained release behavior in vitro. MTT assay and cell apoptosis study suggested that MTX loaded micelles were more effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis on Raji lymphoma cells than MTX injection, which was especially distinct in high dose groups. Cellular uptake study indicated that MPEG-PCL micelle had a 1.5 times higher uptake rate in Raji cells. As for in vivo studies, MTX loaded micelles were more competent to suppress tumor growth and prolong survival time than MTX injection in the subcutaneous Raji lymphoma model. Notably, the high dose group of micelle formulation exhibited the strongest anti-tumor effect without additional toxicity. Furthermore, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical studies showed that tumors of MPEG-PCL-MTX treated mice had more apoptotic cells and fewer proliferative cells. In conclusion, MPEG-PCL-MTX micelle is an excellent intravenously injectable formulation of MTX with both good solubility and enhanced anti-tumor activity, which perfectly meets clinical demands, especially for administration of HD MTX.

AB In an attempt to prepare novel core shell nanocapsules, lipid and Stearic acid-Valine conjugate (Biosurfactant) based nanosystem was prepared to attain high drug loading of hydrophilic drug methotrexate (MTX), with sustained release. Antisolvent nanoprecipitation technique was employed for the formulation of nanoparticles (NPs). Optimized formulation depicted 209.6 +/- 31.3 nm particle size, 0.209 +/- 0.072 PDI and 14.98 +/- 1.33 % w/w drug loading. In vitro release depicted biphasic release for 12 h with initial burst phase followed by sustained release phase. In vitro Haemolytic study on RBC5 revealed haemocompatible nature of MTX-Biosurfactant NPs compared to Biotrexate (R) (Zydus). In vitro cell culture studies showed 3.33 folds and 3.50 folds increase in cellular uptake of MTX at 10 mu g/ml and 15 mu g/ml concentration respectively for developed nanoparticles with 4.16 folds decrease in IC50 value. Higher apoptosis and increased lysosomal membrane permeability were obtained in MTX-Biosurfactants NPs. AUC and T-1/2 was found to increase by 2.55 and 3.25 folds respectively in pharmacokinetic study. Significant reduction in tumor burden and serum toxicity marker level depicted efficacy and safety respectively of the formulation as compared to Biotrexate (R). RBC5 morphology was retained after MTX-Biosurfactants NPs exposure proving its haemocompatibility in vivo.

AB Osteosarcoma is the most common cancer in bone. Drug resistance is a challenge of current treatments that needs to be improved with novel treatment strategies. In this research, a new dual drug delivery system was developed with Gemcitabine (GEM) and Clofazimine (CLF) co-loaded liposome formulations. GEM is a well-known anticancer agent and CLF is a leprostatic and anti-inflammatory drug recently recognized as effective on cancer. GEM and CLF co-loaded liposomal formulation was achieved with compartmentalization as hydrophilic GEM being in core and lipophilic CLF sequestering in lipid-bilayer. Liposomes had high encapsulation efficiency (above 90%, GEM and above 80%, CLF). CLF release was enhanced while GEM release was slowed down in coloaded liposomes compared to single cases. GEM/CLF co-loaded liposomes significantly enhanced cytotoxicity than GEM or CLF loaded liposomes on osteosarcoma cell line. CLF and GEM had synergistic effect (CI < 1). Results of flow cytometry showed higher apoptotic cell ratio, caspase-3 activity, mitochondrial membrane depolarized cells' ratio for GEM/CLF co-loaded liposome treatments than other liposomes. Cytotoxicity of CLF on bone cancer cells and also its synergistic effect with GEM on osteosarcoma is reported for the first time with this study. CLF's loading with GEM into liposome was also a new approach for enhancement of anticancer effect on Saos-2 cells. Therefore, GEM/CLF co-loaded liposomal delivery system is proposed as a novel approach for treatment of osteosarcoma.

AB The use of adrenaline in cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a long-standing medical procedure, recommended by several international guidelines. However, its unspecific action on adrenergic receptors and the need for repeated administrations pose serious concerns about its safety, the balance between benefits and risks being still under debate. To address this issue, a sustained release nano-formulation of adrenaline was developed. Adrenaline was encapsulated into PEGylated, anionic liposomes by a pH-driven loading technique. Particular attention was devoted to the prevention of oxidation of adrenaline by optimizing the preparative process and including an optimal amount of antioxidants in the formulation. The vesicles obtained were then characterized for size, zeta-potential, and lamellarity, while their morphology was described by cryo-TEM. The controlled release properties were confirmed by two different in vitro release-testing methods, and the biocompatibility was assayed on human endothelial cells in vitro.

AB Antibiotic resistant bacterial communities persist in many types of wounds, chronic wounds in particular, in the form of biofilms. Biofilm formation is a major cause of severe infections and the main reason for a negative treatment outcome and slow healing progression. Chronic wounds are a silent epidemic essentially affecting people with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and obesity and elderly persons particularly those with movement limitations. The development of complementary and alternative effective strategies to antibiotics for the treatment of chronic wounds is highly desired. Phage therapy constitutes a very promising approach in the control of topical microbial populations. In this work newly isolated phages were tested for their efficacy to control bacterial species that predominate in chronic wounds. Phage effectiveness was studied on 24-h old biofilms formed in polystyrene microplates and in porcine skin explants using two treatment approaches: individual phage and a cocktail of phages against four main pathogens commonly isolated from chronic wounds. The two models produced variations in the surface colonization ability, assessed by viable bacterial counts and microscopy visualization after using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) or locked nucleic acid probes (LNA) and 2'-O-methyl (2'-OMe) in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and in the phage-host interactions. Phages alone and combined caused greater reductions in the number of viable cells when biofilms had been formed on porcine skins and with greater variations detected at 4 h and 24 h of sampling. These results suggest that porcine skin models should be preferentially used to assess the use of phages and phage cocktails intended for topical use in order to understand the fate, throughout treatment time, of the population when dealing with biofilm-related infections.

AB Aim: It was the aim of the study to develop self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) with the ability to change their zeta potential towards higher values at the adsorption membrane and in this way facilitate the release of the DNA-cetrimonium complex and enhance transfection.
   Methods: Plasmid DNA was complexed via hydrophobic ion pairing utilizing various surfactants and the complex was incorporated into SEDDS achieving a payload of 1% (m/v). Log P-SEDDS/water of the complex was determined. SEDDS were characterized regarding droplet size, zeta potential, stability and toxicity. Alkaline phosphatase presented in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients was quantified using 4-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt and 5-bromo-4-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl phosphate dipotassium salt as substrates. SEDDS containing 0.4% (m/v) 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate monosodium salt were characterized regarding their zeta potential changing properties utilizing isolated alkaline phosphatase and cystic fibrosis sputum. The mucus permeating properties of SEDDS were evaluated via Transwell method using cystic fibrosis sputum. Finally, the transfection efficiency of incorporated plasmid DNA was investigated.
   Results: Cetrimonium bromide showed the highest precipitation efficiency of 99.5 +/- 2.72% for the complexation of pDNA. SEDDS containing propylene glycol, Capmul PG-8, Captex 300, Captex 355, Captex 8000, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH-40 and Brij O10 showed stable emulsions with a droplet size between 20 and 100 nm and zeta potential < - 3 mV over 4 h. SEDDS demonstrated highly protective effect against enzymatic degradation and moderate cell viability on freshly obtained pulmonary tissue. The pDNA-cetrimonium complex incorporated into SEDDS revealed a log PSEDDS/water of about 2. A concentration of 0.879 +/- 0.103 U/g alkaline phosphatase was found in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients. SEDDS containing 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate monosodium salt showed a high potential of changing the zeta potential by applying isolated alkaline phosphatase as well as cystic fibrosis sputum along with high mucus permeating properties. Formulation C demonstrated the highest transfection efficiency with a 7.2-fold increased fluorescence intensity compared to naked pDNA.
   Conclusion: The novel developed zeta potential changing SEDDS are opening versatile opportunities for the treatment of cystic fibrosis caused by gene mutation.

AB To improve the penetration and accumulation of anti-inflammatory drugs in colitis tissue, we functionalized the surface of porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) using pluronic F127 (PF127) and loaded curcumin (CUR) into the resulting NPs to obtain porous PF127-functionalized CUR-loaded NPs (porous PF127-NPs). These NPs had an average hydrodynamic diameter of about 270 nm with a highly monodisperse size distribution, slightly negative surface charge and controllable CUR release profile. It was found that they had good biocompatibility and yielded a much higher cellular uptake rate of CUR than porous CUR-loaded NPs without PF127 modification (porous NPs). In addition, porous PF127-NPs showed a greater capacity to inhibit the major pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-alpha) secreted from lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages than porous NPs and non-porous PF127-NPs. In vivo experiments suggested that porous PF127-NPs achieved the best therapeutic outcomes against ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice compared with porous NPs and non-porous PF127-NPs. Our results clearly demonstrate that these fabricated porous PF127-NPs show a great promise as an efficient CUR nanocarrier for UC therapy.

AB Widespread skin allergies are of high societal concern. This pathology usually includes "histamine intolerance" and inflammatory processes affecting the skin. Oxidative stress, due to both intrinsic and environmental factors, leads to skin disorders, disease, and aging. Since the stratum corneum (SC) allows only small, lipophilic molecules to be absorbed through the skin, proteins, which are large amphoteric macromolecules, display limited bioavailability. The present study investigates the potential of chitosan nanoparticles as vehicle for two enzymes (catalytic proteins): catalase (CAT) and diamine oxidase (histaminase, DAO). Chitosan is an inexpensive, biocompatible, biodegradable, mucoadhesive, antibacterial, and antifungal biopolymer. Chitosan nanoparticles (CNP) have a high surface to volume ratio, hence high surface charge density and stronger biological activity than chitosan itself. CNP encapsulating DAO/CAT were prepared by using chitosans from different sources (shrimp and fungal). Nanoparticles were prepared by ionic complexation with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP). Two different protein concentrations (0.5 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL) were investigated in the preparation of the nanoparticles. The resulting CNP were characterized by size (from 200 to 300 nm) and zeta potential (up to 9 mV) measurements, encapsulation efficiency (EE, up to 48%), loading capacity (LC, up to 42%), ratio of residual amino groups (RRAG, up to 14%), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and residual enzymatic activity. The antioxidant activity of the CNP encapsulating CAT was evaluated as well. The kinetics of protein release from the nanocomposites was monitored spectrophotometrically (for 160 h). Here we report that CAT was encapsulated with higher EE and residual enzymatic activity, while encapsulated DAO displayed better release profiles. Following encapsulation and release from CNP, both enzymes retained activity. The activities of DAO/CAT remained constant after five months in storage at - 20 degrees C. These findings show that tailored nanosized chitosan affords enhancement to enzymes with low activity (like DAO) and shows promise as a carrier for therapeutic enzymes. Further investigations into its capability to increase their bioavailability are warranted.

AB Introduction: There is no consensus on administering hyperosmolar formulations by mouth to neonates. In 1976, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics published a recommendation of not administer formulations with an osmolarity higher than 400 mOsm/L due to the possible damage to intestine and relationship with necrotizing enterocolitis. Since this recommendation, exists a general trend of reducing osmolality of oral formulations without considering the pharmacokinetics of absorption of the drugs.
   The objective of this study was to characterize the permeability values of drugs formulated at different osmolalities by using a well-established rat intestinal perfusion model and to measure the osmolality of the most used formulations in our neonatology unit.
   Methods: For the osmolality measurement study, most common used oral drugs were selected (compounded formulations and drug products). Osmolality of three dilutions (1:1, 1:4 and 1:8) were measured using a cryoscopic descent osmometer.
   Atenolol, caffeine, furosemide, hydrocortisone and paracetamol were selected for the permeability study. Three suspensions were elaborated of each drug (150 mOsm/kg, 300 mOsm/kg and 1500 mOsm/kg). Permeability values and absorption rate coefficients were determined in complete small intestine using in situ "closed loop" perfusion method.
   Results: The formulations that resulted to be hyperosmolar ( > 400 mOsm/kg) were 86% (70% of these proved to be above 1500 mOsm/kg).
   The permeability study shown that the osmolality is inversely proportional to the apparent permeability of the drug in the studied drugs. The permeability values obtained with hyperosmolar samples were lower compared to 150 mOsm/kg or 300 mOsm/kg.
   Conclusions: Osmolality parameter is of particular relevance in oral drug administration in neonate because the risk of damaging the gastrointestinal tract and because of the risk that modifying osmolality also modifies its permeability, resulting in a potential change in bioavailability.

AB Bone infection is a devastating condition resulting from implant or orthopaedic surgery. Therapeutic strategies are extremely complicated and may result in serious side effects or disabilities. The development of enhanced 3D scaffolds, able to promote efficient bone regeneration, combined with targeted antibiotic release to prevent bacterial colonization, is a promising tool for the successful repair of bone defects. Herein, polymeric electrospun scaffolds composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibres decorated with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles loaded with rifampicin were fabricated to achieve local and sustained drug release for more efficient prevention and treatment of infection. The release profile showed an initial burst of rifampicin in the first six hours, enabling complete elimination of bacteria. Sustained and long-term release was observed until the end of the experiments (28 days), facilitating a prolonged effect on the inhibition of bacterial growth, which is in agreement with the common knowledge concerning the acidic degradation of the microparticles. In addition, bactericidal effects against gram negative (Escherichia coli) and gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria were demonstrated at concentrations of released rifampicin up to 58 ppm after 24 h, with greater efficacy against S. aureus (13 ppm vs 58 ppm for E. coli). Cell morphology and cytocompatibility studies highlighted the suitability of the fabricated scaffolds to support cell growth, as well as their promising clinical application for bone regeneration combined with prevention or treatment of bacterial infection.

AB Because numerous challenges limit the effective oral delivery of protein and peptide drugs, we developed promising chitosan (CS)-modified, dual drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) simultaneously containing salmon calcitonin (sCT) and puerarin (PR) (CS-sCT/PR-NPs), and to explore the potential of PR as a protease inhibitor. This oral delivery system showed efficient encapsulation of sCT (75.7%) and PR (50.9%), protection of encapsulated sCT and PR from premature release in simulated gastric fluid (SGJ, pH 1.2), and sustained-release behavior in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4). CS-sCT/PR-NPs were capable of sequential drug-release in which PR was partially released prior to sCT, allowing PR to play a role of enzyme inhibitor before sCT release. Compared with CS-sCT-NPs, CS-sCT/PR-NPs were more stable in simulated intestinal fluid containing pancreatinum. The internalization of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled sCT (FITC-sCT) by Caco-2 cells increased when incorporated into NPs compared with free sCT. In vivo, the oral absolute bioavailability of sCT in CS-sCT/PR-NPs was 12.52 +/- 1.83%, approximately 1.74-fold higher than that of the NPs not co-loaded with PR. In conclusion, the CS-based NPs and introduction of PR as a protease inhibitor improved the oral bioavailability of sCT and had potential to be developed as an oral delivery system of peptide drug.

AB We developed polyamidoamine dendrimers conjugated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for use in receptor-mediated delivery of therapeutics to cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this approach to inhibit proliferation and migration of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells through targeting of EPS8, a key regulator of squamous carcinoma growth and motility. Use of EGF-dendrimers to deliver siRNA or shRNA against EPS8 resulted in inhibition of cell growth and reduction in cell motility. Moreover, more profound repression of the target protein was obtained with repeat exposure to the targeting reagent, and was consistent with the altered biological properties. Thus, targeting of EPS8 can be achieved with EGF-conjugated dendrimers delivering EPS8-specific RNAi therapeutics, leading to a reduction in the malignant phenotype of cells.

AB Nanoparticles based on biodegradable polymers are well-known as approved carrier systems for a diversity of drugs. Despite their advantages, such as the option of an active drug targeting or the physicochemical protection of instable payloads, the controlled drug release often underlies intra- and interindividual influences and is therefore difficult to predict. To circumvent this limitation, the release behavior can be optimized using light-responsive materials for the nanoparticle preparation. The resulting light-responsive nanoparticles are able to release the embedded drug after an external light-stimulus, thereby increasing efficacy and safety of the therapy.
   In the present study light-responsive self-immolative polymers were used for the nanoparticle manufacturing. Light-responsive polycarbonates (LrPC) as well as PEGylated LrPC (LrPC-PEG) were synthesized via ring-opening polymerization of trimethylene carbonate-based monomers and fully physico-chemically characterized. Light-responsive nano formulations were obtained by blending LrPC or (LrPC-PEG) with the FDA-approved polymer poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The nanoparticles were loaded with the photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(m-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (mTHPC). The light-induced nanoparticle degradation was analyzed as well as the drug release behavior with and without illumination. Furthermore, biological safety of the degradation products was investigated in an in vitro cell culture study.

AB Pancreatic islet transplantation has proved to be a promising therapy for T1DM, in spite of the chronic immunosuppression required. Although cell microencapsulation technology represents an alternative to circumvent the immune system rejection of transplanted pancreatic islets, the environment provided by classical alginate microcapsules does not mimic the natural ECM, affecting the islet survival. Since hyaluronic acid, one of the major components of pancreatic ECM, is involved in cell adhesion and viability, we assessed the beneficial outcomes on encapsulated insulin-producing cells by the HA inclusion in alginate matrices. In this manuscript we describe how alginate-HA hybrid microcapsules enhance the viability of encapsulated cells, reducing early apoptosis percentage and decreasing membrane damage. A stable insulin production was maintained in encapsulated cells, not altering the response to a glucose stimulus. Therefore, we can conclude that the inclusion of HA within alginate microcapsules is beneficial for encapsulated insulin-producing cells, representing a step forward in the clinical translation of microcapsules technology for the treatment of T1DM.

AB The paper reports the synthesis and physico-chemical and biological characterization of novel wound dressings based on collagen and essential oil functionalized ZnO nanoparticles intended to improve the treatment of burns and to reduce the risk for developing wound sepsis in patients with burns or chronic wounds. The prepared wound dressings were physico-chemical characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In vitro biocompatibility and cytotoxicity was proved on human fibroblast cells, antimicrobial potential was assessed on Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria models (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coll., respectively), while in vivo studies were performed on a rat burn wound experimental model. Functionalized ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) proved to range 15-20 nm in size and contain about 1% orange essential oil (EO), which was utilized as a natural antimicrobial agent. NPs are grain-shapped and have a low tendency to form aggregates. No toxicity was noticed in vitro, as human fibroblasts maintained a normal growth and their membrane integrity in the presence of EO functionalized NPs. The capacity of the prepared wound dressings to act as implantable bioresorbable scaffolds that accelerates wounds healing along with an excellent biocompatibility, lack of cytotoxicity and a good antibacterial activity, make these materials promising and safe candidates for wound dressing, especially in burn patients.

AB In the present comparative study, gelatin microspheres (GMs) were prepared by emulsification-solvent-extraction method using well-known crosslinker: glutaraldehyde (GA) and biocompatible silane-coupling agent glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS). Crosslinking with GA was done by a definite and common procedure, while GPTMS crosslinking potency was investigated after 5, 10, 24, and 48 h synthesis periods and the fabrication method was adjusted in order for preparation of GMs with optimized morphological and compositional characteristics. The prepared GMs were then evaluated and compared as drug delivery systems for the antibiotic vancomycin (Vm). Morphological observations, FTIR, ninhydrin assay, swelling behavior evaluation and Hydrolytic degradation analysis proved successful modification of GMs and revealed that increasing synthesis time from 5 h to 24 h and 48 h, when using GPTMS as crosslinker, led to formation of morphologically-optimized GMs with highest crosslinking degree ( similar to 50%) and the slowest hydrolytic degradation rate. Such GMs also exhibited most sustained release period of Vm. The antibacterial test results against gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, were in accordance with the release profiles of Vm, as well. Together, GPTMS-crosslinked GMs with their preferable characteristics and known as biocompatible gelatin-siloxane hybrids, could act as proper drug delivery systems for the sustained release of the antibiotic vancomycin.

AB The manufacture of oral dosage form may induce changes in the physical form of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. One such example includes formation of hydrate during granulation followed by the reverse transition to the anhydrous form during drying. We used naproxen sodium dihydrate (DH) as the model compound and studied its dehydration at elevated temperature under different processing conditions, (i) in ambient air, (ii) in flow of inert gas (iii) under low pressure environment, and (iv) under 'high' pressure in closed environments. In situ variable temperature X-ray diffraction was used to monitor kinetics of phase transformation under these processing conditions. The DH dehydration was fastest under the flow of inert gas and slowest in closed environment. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), commonly used hygroscopic solids, were used as the model excipients to monitor influence of excipients in modulating DH dehydration behavior under different processing conditions. Both the excipients altered the kinetics as well as the extent of DH dehydration, with PVP delaying and MCC facilitating the transformation under all processing conditions studied. The results indicate that the physical form of API, such as hydrate or anhydrous in the present case, in the formulation may be modulated by rational excipient selection.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate how the addition of hydrophobic inclusions to sustained-release pellet film coat can affect drug release. Sustained-release formulations, in particular multiparticulate systems are gaining popularity because they are able to reduce the dosing frequency of drugs that require multiple dosing. In addition, the risk of dose dumping is low and local gastrointestinal irritation is minimised. Metformin-loaded pellets, prepared via extrusion-spheronisation, were coated with ethyl cellulose (EC)-based film coat, with and without hydrophobic inclusions to a series of coat thickness. Stearic acid 50 (SA) and hydrogenated castor oil (HCO) were the hydrophobic inclusions used. Drug release was investigated using the USP dissolution apparatus 2 and an ultraviolet imager. Release kinetics were analysed using the zero-order model. The physical properties of the pellets were characterised before and after dissolution. The addition of hydrophobic inclusions to EC-based film coat slowed down drug release, with SA slowing down drug release more than HCO. The influence of hydrophobic inclusions on drug release was clearly observable when the pellets were coated to 10% weight gain. It was postulated that the hydrophobic inclusions acted as physical barriers to increase the tortuosity of the diffusional path through the pellet film coat. The use of hydrophobic inclusions to control the rate of drug dissolution was shown to be promising. This could translate into potential cost and time savings with less materials and time used.

AB The intention of present research work is to formulate usnic acid (UA) loaded heparin modified gellan gum (HAG) nanoparticles (NPs). HAG copolymer based conjugation was synthesized and characterized by H-1 NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. Plain and UA loaded HAG NPs were prepared via nanoprecipitation technique. NPs were typified and further characterized for particle size, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, zeta potential, atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction analysis, and in-vitro release. Invitro tube formation assay, tumorsphere assay, autophagy assay, DNA cleavage assay, internalization by confocal and FAGS based internalization analysis, caspase assay and cell cycle assay were performed for biological activity. Obtained experimental results explored that HAG NPs displayed a sustained release of UA (95.67% in 48 h) compared to gellan gum NPs (96.12% in 8 h). In cytotoxicity studies, UA loaded HAG NPs exhibited an enormous cytotoxic potential against A549 cancer cells. In the in vivo bio-distribution study, using albino rat model the free UA concentration was found 7.09 +/- 0.9%, 2.7 +/- 1.5%, 7.5 +/- 2.1, 9.2 +/- 2%, and 6.25 +/- 1.3% post two hours of intravenous administration, however, in the case of UA loaded HAG NPs the obtained level was 4.1 +/- 1.10, 7.7 +/- 1.30%, 2.21 +/- 0.29%, 1.85 +/- 0.25%, 2.2 +/- 0.78%, 2.9 +/- 1.21% respectively, in heart, lung, liver, spleen, intestine and kidney. The overall anticancer study and result of internalization deciphered the higher anticancer potential of UA loaded HAG NPs.

AB Extensive research has demonstrated the potential effectiveness of curcumin against various diseases, including asthma and cancers. However, few studies have used liquid-based vehicles in the preparation of curcumin formulations. Therefore, the current study proposed the use of nanoemulsion and microsuspension formulations to prepare nebulised curcuminoid for lung delivery. Furthermore, this work expressed a new approach to understanding the aerosol performance of nanoparticles compared to microsuspension formulations. The genotoxicity of the formulations was also assessed. Curcuminoid nanoemulsion formulations were prepared in three concentrations (100, 250 and 500 mu g/ml) using limonene and oleic acid as oil phases, while microsuspension solutions were prepared by suspending curcuminoid particles in isotonic solution (saline solution) of 0.02% Tween 80. The average fine particle fraction (FPF) and mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the nebulised microsuspension formulations ranged from 26% and 7.1 mu m to 40% and 5.7 mu m for 1000 mu g/ml and 100 mu g/ml respectively. In a comparison of the low and high drug concentrations of the nebulised nanoemulsion, the average FPF and MMAD of the nebulised nanoemulsion formulations prepared with limonene oil ranged from 50% and 4.6 mu m to 45% and 5.6 mu m respectively; whereas the FPF and MMAD of the nebulised nanoemulsion prepared with oleic acid oil ranged from 46% and 4.9 mu m to 44% and 5.6 mu m respectively. The aerosol performance of the microsuspension formulations were concentration dependent, while the nanoemulsion formulations did not appear to be dependent on the curcuminoids concentration. The performance and genotoxicity results of the formulations suggest the suitability of these preparations for further inhalation studies in animals.

AB The combination regimen of irinotecan (IRI) and doxorubicin (DOX) for cancer treatment has been frequently exploited in clinical studies, but face challenges in design of efficacious combination drug delivery systems. Here we demonstrate a novel nanoliposome constructed by triethylammonium sucrose octasulfate gradient loading method for co-delivering the two therapeutic agents. In vitro cytotoxicity of IRI, DOX and their combinations against breast cancer cells (4T-1), non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549) and colon cancer cells (HT-29) was evaluated to screen optimal synergistic ratio of the two drugs. The co-delivery nanocarrier maintained the synergistic ratio in vivo, and increased tumor distribution of both drugs (approximate to 2.18-fold vs single drug-loaded formulations). IRI/DOX co-loaded liposomes, with exceedingly high drug-to-phospholipid ratio of 0.61: 1 (molar ratio), exhibit potent antitumor efficacy in the 4T-1 mammary carcinoma xenograft, compared to the mixture of single drug-loaded liposomes (P < 0.001). This co-encapsulated and co-delivered nanoliposome technology offers a promising strategy for cancer treatment.

AB We studied the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and metabolism of phospho-sulindac (PS), a novel agent efficacious in the treatment of dry eye, formulated in nanoparticles (PS-NPs) following its topical administration to the eye of New Zealand White rabbits. The nanoparticles were spherical with effective diameter = 108.9 +/- 41.7 nm, zeta potential = - 21.70 +/- 3.78 mV, drug loading = 7%, and entrapment efficiency = 46.4%. Of the total PS delivered topically to the eye, > 95% was retained in the anterior segment, predominantly in the cornea (C-max = 101.3 mu M; T-max = 1 h; T-1(/2) = 2.6 h; area AUC(0-16h) = 164.4 mu M.h) and conjunctiva (C-max = 89.4 mu M; T-max = 0.25 h; T-1(/2) = 3.1 h; AUC(0-16h) = 63.5 mu M.h), the tissues most affected by dry eye disease. No PS or its metabolites were detected in the systemic circulation. PS was metabolized to PS sulfide and PS sulfone; all three molecules were hydrolyzed to sulindac, which was converted to sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone. A solution formulation of PS provided lower PS levels in ocular tissues but higher levels of PS metabolites, compared to PS-NPs. Therefore, NPs represent an effective formulation for the topical ocular administration of PS for anterior segment diseases, such as dry eye disease.

AB Temozolomide presents significant anticancer activities in preclinical trials. However, its clinical applications suffer from serious side effects owing to the high concentration in blood and normal tissues. In this study, mathematical modelling is applied to simulate the liposome-mediated delivery of temozolomide under different conditions in a 3-D realistic brain tumour model reconstructed from MR images. Delivery outcomes are evaluated by the bioavailability of free temozolomide across time. As compared to the oral and intravenous administration of free temozolomide, liposome-mediated delivery can successfully improve the drug accumulation in tumour while reducing the drug exposure in blood and normal tissue. Results show that the delivery is less sensitive to the duration of intravenous infusion but highly dependent on the liposome properties. The treatment can be improved by either enhancing the liposome transvascular permeability or using the liposomes with high extracellular release rates. Intravascular release can only increase the risk of adverse effects rather than improving the drug bioavailability in tumour. Results obtained in this study could be applied for optimising the treatment using liposome encapsulated temozolomide.

AB Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have drawn extensive attention as carriers on drug delivery. However, most of MIPs suffer from insufficient drug loading capacity, burst release of drugs and/or low bioavailability. To solve the issues, this study designed an imprinted material with superior floating nature for oral drug delivery system of capecitabine (CAP) rationally. The MIPs was synthesized in the presence of 4-methylphenyl dicyclohexyl ethylene (liquid crystalline, LC) and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) via polymerization reaction. The LC-POSS MIPs had extended release of the template molecules over 13.4 h with entrapment efficiency of 20.53%, diffusion coefficient of 2.83 x 10(-11) cm(2) s(-1), and diffusion exponent of 0.84. Pharmacokinetic studies further revealed the prolong release and high relative bioavailability of CAP in vivo of rats, showing the effective floating effect of the LC-POSS MIPs. The in vivo images revealed visually that the gastroretentive time of the LC-POSS MIPs was longer than non-LC-POSS imprinted polymers. The physical characteristics of the polymers were also characterized by nitrogen adsorption experiment, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analysis. As a conclusion, the LC-POSS MIPs can be used as an eligible CAP carrier and might hold great potential in clinical applications for sustained release drug.

AB Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a common intractable barrier in success of clinical cancer chemotherapy. Codelivery of two drugs using nanocarriers is a commonly used approach to treat the MDR cancer. However, the drug payload in the conventional nanocarriers is low and thus compromises the treatment outcomes. Disulfiram (DSF) is promising to reverse MDR and increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy. While, paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the frequently used anticancer drug. Here, by using a drug-delivering-drug (DDD) strategy based on nanocrystals, hybrid PTX-DSF nanocrystals (PTX-DSF Ns) were developed for codelivery of PTX and DSF to reverse MDR in cancer. The 160-nm PTX-DSF Ns with rod-like morphology had drug-loading up to 43% at mass ratio of 5:1. Interestingly, the nanoparticles entered cells via caveolar endocytosis. By reducing intracellular ATP level and GST activity, PTX-DSF Ns killed the Taxol resistant A549 cells with higher efficiency than PTX alone, exhibiting as 6-fold increase of apoptosis in MDR tumor. The nanoparticles circulated in blood over time, accumulated in tumor efficiently and reduced the tumor volume by 12-fold in MDR tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice and allowed 12-fold apoptosis in tumor. Additionally, the immunohistochemical examination demonstrated the safety of the nanoparticles. Overall, the DDD strategy-based PTX-DSF Ns have promising potential for the treatment of MDR cancer.

AB Self-assembled organogelators were explored as artificial stratum corneum (SC) models for the in vitro skin permeation assessment. Four SC models consisting of binary (organogels) or ternary (microemulsion-based organogels) mixtures were developed using stearic acid, tristearin, or sorbitan tristearate, at two different concentrations, gelled in squalene. The permeation of lipophilic butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane and hydrophilic methylene blue as the permeant compounds across the SC models was compared with ex vivo experiments using excised porcine ear skin. A multi-analytical approach was adopted to provide detailed understanding about organogelator organization within the SC models and find possible parameters playing key-roles in SC permeation prediction. The SC models were investigated for gelling properties and microstructure. Parameters such as gel occurrence, organogelator concentration, and rheological properties appeared as negligible conditions for skin permeation prediction. Conversely, arrangement packing, interactions, and crystallinity extent of the self-assembled organogelator were found to play a fundamental role in the simulation of SC barrier function according to the permeant feature.

AB In the current study, we employed poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers of generation 4 (G4) to deliver paclitaxel (PTX), a poorly soluble anti-cancer agent precisely to cancer cells via its conjugation on dendrimer surface. Further, G4 PAMAM has been PEGylated (PEG) and tagged with Biotin, an essential micronutrient for cellular functions, receptors of which are overexpressed in certain cancers. The synthesized multifunctional conjugates were characterized by H-1 NMR and zeta potential analysis techniques. In addition, the conjugates were evaluated in vitro in cell monolayers and 3D spheroids of biotin receptor over-expressed A549 cell line (human non-small cell lung cancer). G4 PTX PEG-Biotin conjugate penetrated at significantly higher extent in monolayers as well as spheroids as studied by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy by visualizing the cells at varied depth. The G4 PTX PEG-Biotin conjugate demonstrated higher cytotoxicity compared to free PTX and G4 PTX PEG conjugate as assessed by MTT assay in monolayers and Presto Blue assay in detached spheroidal cells. G4 PTX PEG-Biotin demonstrated significant inhibition of growth of tumor spheroids. Therefore, the newly synthesized biotin anchored PTX-conjugated dendrimer system is promising and could be further explored for efficiently delivering PTX to biotin receptor overexpressed cancers.

AB In this study, the volumetric and gravimetric feeding behavior of 15 pharmaceutical powders on a low feed rate feeder was correlated with their material properties through a multivariate approach. The powders under investigation differ substantially in terms of material properties, making the selected powders representative for powders typically used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The material properties were described by 25 material property descriptors, obtained from a rational selection of critical characterization techniques that provided maximal information with minimal characterization effort. From volumetric feeding experiments (i.e., powder feed rate not controlled), the maximum feeding capacity (maximum feed factor (FFmax)) and optimal hopper fill level at which the feeder should be refilled during gravimetric feeding (feed factor decay (FFdecay)) were obtained. During gravimetric feeding experiments (i.e., powder feed rate controlled), the variability on the feed rate (relative standard deviation (RSD)) and the difference between the setpoint and mean feed rate (relative error (RE)) were determined. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was applied to correlate the volumetric and gravimetric feeding responses (Y) with the material property descriptors (X). The predictive ability of the developed PLS models was assessed by predicting the feeding responses of two new powders (i.e., validation set). Overall, the volumetric feeding responses (FFmax, and FFdecay) were predicted better than the gravimetric feeding responses (RSD and RE), since in gravimetric mode the impact of material properties on the feeding behavior is reduced due to the control system of the feeder. Especially RE was weakly correlated with material properties as RE of most powders varied around zero with only a small numerical variation. Interestingly, this confirms that the control system is working properly and that the feeder is capable of feeding different powders accurately at low feed rates. The developed models allowed to predict the feeding behavior of new powders based on their material properties. Consequently the number of feeding experiments during process development can be greatly reduced, thereby leading to a more efficient and faster development of new drug products.

AB Direct compaction tableting, a desired manufacturing option, is infeasible for blends containing fine cohesive poorly-compactable APIs at higher drug loadings. In this study, the feasibility of using fine, dry coated excipients is investigated instead of dry coating of the APIs, as was done previously. Avicel PH-105 (20.1 mu m) dry coated with 1 wt% hydrophilic silica A200 as an engineered excipient was blended with fine (11.3 mu m) or semi-fine (30.2 mu m) Acetaminophen, or Ibuprofen 50 (55.4 mu m) in binary blends at low, medium and high drug loadings (10%, 30%, 60%). The blend uniformity, bulk density, flowability, as well as tablet properties such as friability, weight variation and strength demonstrate overall better performance compared to blends with Avicel PH-105, Prosolv 50 or Prosolv 90 as the excipient. These results along with processability maps of bulk density vs. FFC and tablet tensile strength vs. FFC indicate dry coated Avicel PH-105 could enable direct compaction for IBU50 and cAPAP at all drug loadings, and up to 30% drug loading for mAPAP. In contrast, Prosolv 90 failed for IBU50 at 60% drug loading, and for mAPAP at all drug loadings. Prosolv 50 could only enable direct compaction for IBU50 at all drug loadings. These unexpected outcomes suggest that for direct compaction of very fine, cohesive APIs at higher drug loadings, surface modified fine excipients perform better. A surprising outcome is the improvement in tablet strength for blends with dry coated Avicel PH-105 compared to uncoated Avicel PH-105 at higher drug loading, especially considering parts I and II showed that silica dry coating decreases the placebo tablet tensile strength.

AB We have previously developed a fast screening method on the ability of twenty amino acids (AA) to form coamorphous formulations with six drugs upon ball milling. In this work, the potential advantages in physical stability and dissolution rate of the 36 successful co-amorphous formulations, compared to the pure amorphous drug, were further investigated. The physical stability of the formulations at dry conditions was assessed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and their thermal behavior by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In addition, the intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) of all formulations was determined in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.8). Finally, all the co-amorphous formulations were summarized into different groups, according to the outcome of the co-formability, physical stability and dissolution rate screenings, and guidelines could be drawn for selection of co-formers for a new given drug: (i) For acidic drugs, basic AAs (arginine, histidine, and lysine) are good co-formers with respect to the three critical quality attributes: co-formability, physical stability and dissolution. High glass transition temperatures (T-g), physical stability for 1-2 years, and accelerated IDR were observed. (ii) For basic and neutral drugs, non-polar AAs with aromatic groups such as tryptophan (TRP) and phenylalanine (PHE) should be explored as first choice. These combinations presented high T(g)s, which generally translated into good physical stability. The IDR of TRP- and PHE-based formulations were usually superior to the IDR of the pure amorphous drugs; (iii) Non-polar AAs with aliphatic structures such as leucine, isoleucine, methionine and valine did not provide an increase in T-g or IDR compared to the pure amorphous drug, and appear to be less feasible AAs for co-amorphous formulations.

AB The 'repurposed drug,' disulfiram (DSF), is an inexpensive FDA-approved anti-alcoholism drug with multi-target anti-cancer effect. However, the use of DSF in clinical settings remains limited due to its high instability in blood. In the present study, we created nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) encapsulated DSF modified with D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (vitamin E-TPGS). A spherical shape, superior drug encapsulation (80.7%), and decreased crystallinity of DSF were confirmed with results obtained from TEM, XRD, and DSC analysis. Addition of TPGS considerably improved the physicochemical stability profile of NLC-encapsulated DSF under the different conditions tested here. Furthermore, TPGS-DSF-NLCs outperformed unmodified DSF-NLCs and the free DSF solution by having significantly higher cytotoxicity, lower IC50 value (4T1: 263.2 nM and MCF7: 279.9 nM), and an enhanced cellular uptake in MCF7 and 4T1 cell lines. In vivo anti-tumor analysis in 4T1 murine xenograft model mice revealed a significant (p-value < 0.05) decrease in tumor volume and higher tumor growth inhibition rate (48.24%) with TPGS-DSF-NLC treatment as compared to both the free DSF solution (8.49%) and DSF-NLC formulations (29.2%). Histopathology analysis of tumor tissues further confirmed a noticeably higher anti-tumor activity of TPGS-DSF-NLC through augmented cell necrosis in solid tumors. Hence, the present study established that addition of TPGS can synergize the anti-cancer activity of NLC-encapsulated DSF formulations, and thus, offer a promising anti-cancer delivery system for DSF.

AB Hydrophobic and hydrophilic thermoplastic poly(urethane) (TPU) mixtures offer the opportunity to tune water swelling capacity and diffusion rate for drugs exhibiting broadly different properties. We sought to (1) assess the range of drug diffusion rates achieved by varying hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic TPU ratio relative to varying ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) crystallinity; (2) investigate the effect of mixture ratio on permeability of emtricitabine; and (3) investigate the impact of the extrusion process on mixing of the two TPUs and the resulting impact on drug diffusion. The permeability of water-soluble emtricitabine exhibited a 736-fold range across the blends of TPU, but only a 3.4-fold range across the EVA grades investigated. Varying hydrophilic content of the TPU mixture from 0% to 25% (w/w) led to a negligible permeability change, while changing hydrophilic content from 55% to 100% resulted in a linear 3-fold increase in drug permeability. Interestingly, an 123-fold permeability change occurred between 50% and 55% hydrophilic polymer. Extrusion process parameters exhibited minimal impact on homogeneity and drug diffusion. These findings suggest that hydrophilic polymer domains form a continuous network at levels above 55% hydrophilic TPU, thus facilitating a water-filled porous network when exposed to water that provides a mechanism for accelerated drug diffusion.

AB Rabies is fatal in all unvaccinated patients bitten by dogs, and so post-exposure vaccine regimens must be robust enough to ensure their survival under all conditions. Treatment tends to be excessive for most people, but there is justified anxiety about reducing vaccine dosage and shortening regimens. Recently, World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended one week primary post-exposure intradermal regimens requiring 3 clinic visits, but these are unlikely to prove economical where rabies vaccination is most needed, in deprived rural areas of Africa and Asia.
   A highly immunogenic regimen involving two doses of intradermal vaccine given one week apart has advantages over other regimens. Anyone exposed to a possibly rabid animal would be given intradermal (ID) injections at 4 sites using a whole vial of vaccine. Those who had not been previously vaccinated would be given 2-site ID injections using half a vial one week later. Those who might be immunosuppressed could be given an optional single ID dose on day 28. The rationale for this regimen is discussed in the context of the recently revised WHO recommendations for rabies prophylaxis. (C) 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hepatitis B is a viral disease of global importance. In Catalonia in the 1980s, the seroepidemiological pattern of HBV infection was low-intermediate. In 1990, the Expert Committee on Vaccinations of the Department of Health of the Generalitat of Catalonia evaluated the systematic introduction of hepatitis B vaccination in preadolescents, maintaining the vaccination of risk groups. The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness and impact of the systematic hepatitis B vaccination programme in preadolescents in Catalonia 21 years after its introduction. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing the disease incidence in vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. Cases of hepatitis B were defined as those reported by the General Subdirectorate of Surveillance and Response to Public Health Emergencies between 2000 and 2014. The incidence rate was 2.5 per 100,000 persons in 1991 and 1.2 per 100,000 persons in 2014, a reduction of 52%. During the study period, 388 cases of hepatitis B infection were notified, of which three were classified as vaccine failures. Vaccine effectiveness was 99.30% (95% CI: 97.83-99.78) and the population prevented fraction in the cohorts of preadolescents studied was 64.56% (95% CI: 60.45-68.66). The effectiveness and impact of the hepatitis B vaccination program in preadolescents in Catalonia is high, with the consequent benefits for the population. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Prescottella equi (formerly Rhodococcus equi) is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes severe pneumonia in foals 1-6 months of age, whereas adult horses are highly resistant to infection. We have shown that vaccinating pregnant mares against the conserved surface polysaccharide capsule, beta-1 -> 6-linked poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG). elicits opsonic killing antibody that transfers via colostrum to foals and protects them against experimental infection with virulent.
   R. equi. We hypothesized that equine IgG(1) might be more important than IgG(4/7) for mediating protection against R. equi infection in foals. To test this hypothesis, we compared complement component 1 (C1) deposition and polymorphonuclear cell-mediated opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) mediated by IgG(1) or IgG(4/7) enriched from either PNAG hyperimmune plasma (HIP) or standard plasma. Subclasses IgG(1) and IgG(4/7) from PNAG HIP and standard plasma were precipitated onto a diethylaminoethyl ion exchange column, then further enriched using a protein G Sepharose column. We determined Cl deposition by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and estimated OPK by quantitative microbiologic culture. Anti-PNAG IgG(1) deposited significantly (P < 0.05) more Cl onto PNAG than did IgG(4/7) from PNAG HIP or subclasses IgG(1) and IgG(4/7) from standard plasma. In addition, IgG(1) from PNAG HIP mediated significantly (P < 0.05) greater OPK than lgG(4/7) from PNAG HIP or IgG(1) and IgG(4/7) from standard plasma. Our findings indicate that anti-PNAG IgG(1) is a correlate of protection against R. equi in foals, which has important implications for understanding the immunopathogenesis of R. equi pneumonia, and as a tool for assessing vaccine efficacy and effectiveness when challenge is not feasible.

AB Transmission is a potential property of live viral vaccines that remains largely unexploited but may lie within the realm of many engineering designs. While likely unacceptable for vaccines of humans, transmission may be highly desirable for vaccines of wildlife, both to protect natural populations and also to limit zoonotic transmissions into humans. Defying intuition, transmission alone does not guarantee that a vaccine will perform well: the benefit of transmission over no transmission depends on and increases with the basic reproductive number of the vaccine, R-0. The R-0 of an infectious agent in a homogeneous population is typically considered to be a fixed number, but some evidence suggests that dissemination of transmissible vaccines may change through time. One obvious possibility is that transmission will be greater from hosts directly vaccinated than from hosts who acquire the vaccine passively, but other types of change might also accrue. Whenever transmission changes over time, the R-0 estimated from directly vaccinated hosts will not reflect the vaccine's long term impact. As there is no theory on the consequences of changing transmission rates for a vaccine, we derive conditions for a transmissible vaccine with varying transmission rates to protect a population from pathogen invasion. Being the first in the transmission chain, the R-0 from directly vaccinated hosts has a larger effect than those from later steps in the chain. This mathematical property reveals that a transmissible vaccine with low long term transmission may nonetheless realize a big impact if early transmission is high. Furthermore, there may be ways to artificially elevate early transmission, thereby achieving high herd immunity from transmission while ensuring that the vaccine will ultimately die out.

AB Background: Politics play a role in the dissemination of public health information, including immunization-related issues. We aim to describe relationships between HPV vaccination rates and state voting patterns during the 2016 US presidential election.
   Methods: We classified each of the 50 states as either "Red" or "Blue," based on whether a higher proportion of the state's casted votes were for the Republican or Democratic nominee during the 2016 US presidential election. State-specific HPV, Tdap, and meningococcal vaccination rates were obtained from the 2016-National Immunization Survey-Teen. State socio-demographic factors and HPV vaccine legislation were obtained from the US Census Bureau and National Conference of State Legislatures. Vaccination rates and socio-demographic variables were compared using independent t-tests. Multiple linear regression compared vaccination rates between "Red" and "Blue" states, adjusting for percentage of both uninsured children and educational attainment.
   Results: Compared to "Blue" states, "Red" states had significantly lower unadjusted HPV vaccine series initiation (56% vs 66%, p < 0.05) and completion (39% vs 50%, p < 0.05) rates; yet had similar rates of Tdap (88% vs 89%, p > 0.05) and meningococcal (79% vs 83%, p > 0.05) vaccinations. After adjusting for potential confounders, the regression-adjusted mean rate for HPV vaccine initiation and completion remained significantly lower for "Red" states compared to "Blue" states (57% vs 65%, p < 0.05, and 41% vs 48%, p < 0.05, respectively).
   Conclusion: HPV vaccination rates are associated with statewide-level voting patterns. Future interventions aimed at improving HPV vaccination rates should consider engaging local and national elected leaders to be proactive in disseminating accurate and authoritative immunization information.

AB Introduction: Vaccine hesitancy (VH) has emerged as a factor in vaccine delay and refusal yet the measurement of the constructs within vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge. Outstanding questions include; should VH be measured as an attitude or a behavior? What is the role of key constructs including confidence, complacency, and convenience? What is the role of trust? Should measures be general or vaccine specific? Furthermore, much of the research has centered on parental acceptance of vaccines for their children.
   Methods: In March of 2015, we contracted with the GfK Group to conduct a nationally representative survey with 819 African American and 838 White, US born adults. Measures include general vaccine hesitancy and confidence, trust, and influenza vaccine specific measures of hesitancy, confidence and trust.
   Results: Factor analysis yielded a bi-factor structure for both general vaccine hesitancy and flu vaccine specific hesitancy. Greater hesitancy, both in general and specific to the flu vaccine, was associated with lower vaccine uptake. In the flu vaccine specific model, greater confidence was associated with higher vaccine uptake. Trust remained distinct from vaccine confidence in both the general and flu vaccine specific models.
   Conclusions: Clearly, there is value in the utilization of general vaccine hesitancy and confidence measures, as well as vaccine specific measures. Trust continues to provide additional insights apart of vaccine confidence and remains an important factor for inclusion in future research. Our set of measures can be tested and validated with other populations and applied to other vaccines for adults and children. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID HPV; KNOWLEDGE; AWARENESS
AB Background: The highly prevalent cervical cancer can be prevented through a vaccine. However, the uptake of the Human Papillomavirus vaccine in the general population continues to be low. Medical students, as healthcare providers in the future, would be influential in affecting the community's views and thereby the uptake of the Human Papillomavirus vaccine. Hence, there is a need to promote the right attitude for prompt implementation of this vaccine among medical students. None of the studies in India have so far documented the proportion of vaccinated population among medical students or an intervention strategy to eliminate the barriers to Human Papillomavirus vaccine.
   Aims and objectives: To determine the proportion of vaccinated medical students and the barriers against HPV vaccination among non-vaccinated participants; and to test the efficacy of an information session on the barrier.
   Methodology: Data on barriers against the Human Papillomavirus vaccination was collected through a questionnaire-based survey. The barriers were reassessed after an intervention in the form of training session using audio-visual aids.
   Results: Out of the 263 participants, 46 (18%) had never heard of the vaccine against Human Papillomavirus and only 54 (21%) were vaccinated. Participants thought it was not essential to get vaccinated as they were not sexually active (28%). Lack of information about the vaccine (28%), its access (24%), and high cost (27%) were the other barriers. Following the information session, 59% of the previously non-vaccinated participants responded that they would get vaccinated while 34% were considering getting vaccinated. The most common reason for rejection of the vaccine post- intervention was high cost of the vaccine.
   Conclusion: Vaccine uptake is very low among medical students and amenable barriers exist against the vaccine. Urgent intervention in the form of information session is recommended targeted at the medical students, to eliminate the barriers of Human Papillomavirus vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID VACCINATION; GUIDELINES; COLLECTION; SYSTEM; RATES
AB Background: The national Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) surveillance system in China (CNAEFIS) has collected AEFI reports -including deaths following all vaccines used in China since 2008. Aims: To review reports of AEFI-associated death cases from 2010 to 2015 to assess potential vaccine safety issues.
   Methods: Descriptive analysis of epidemiologic characteristic of AEFI-associated death cases and standard causality assessment for reported causes of deaths. To estimate the risk of death after vaccination, we used population data, administered doses and live births to calculate denominators.
   Results: During 2010-2015, 753 deaths were reported to CNAEFIS from mainland China. Highest numbers were reported in 2013 and 2014 when reporting peak of AEFI-associated deaths occurred after media reports concerning "death following Hepatitis B vaccination" in China. About 95% of deaths were in children <5 years of age and males accounted for 60%. Most common vaccines associated with reports of fatal AEFIs were vaccines in national immunization schedule. In causality assessment, 120 (16.0%) deaths were classified as vaccine-associated reactions such as anaphylactic reactions and disseminated BCG infections; 594 (78.9%) deaths were identified as coincidental events. The main causes of death were asphyxia, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The overall estimated AEFI-associated death rates were: 0.26 per million vaccination doses administered and 0.09 per million population. The neonatal AEFI death rate was 0.77 per million live births.
   Conclusions: These data provide reassuring information about the small risk of death following immunization. They also illustrate sensitivity of passive reporting to public information and that peaks in serious AEFI reports should be interpreted with caution. Continuous monitoring and scientific causality assessment for serious AEFIs, including AEFI-associated deaths is imperative to ensure public confidence in the immunization program.

AB Introduction: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has focused on maternal Tdap immunization as an important means to protect neonates from pertussis infections. There is little published data on provider and/or clinic characteristics as predictors of maternal Tdap uptake. This study examined differences in maternal Tdap coverage in women delivering at a single academic institution, but cared for prenatally in different clinical settings, in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Additionally, the accuracy and utilization of Vermont's immunization information system (IIS) was assessed.
   Methods: This was a retrospective, multiple time-point cross-sectional analysis of annual maternal Tdap coverage in women delivering at a single academic institution in the 3 years following a fundamental change in national maternal Tdap vaccination guidelines. Tdap administration was examined across different obstetric groups using chart review and data from the state's IIS.
   Results: All obstetric care groups except the resident-staffed clinic significantly increased maternal Tdap coverage in 2014, compared to 2013 coverage, with no further increase in 2015. In contrast, there was no increase in maternal Tdap coverage in 2014 in the resident-staffed clinics, but then a statistically significant increase in 2015. Overall Tdap coverage in 2014 was 80.4%, with variation in Tdap coverage between clinics types. In the subset of women who were cared for by the University-based groups, there was significant variation in Tdap coverage between clinics, despite racial homogeneity, which persisted after adjustment for maternal age and insurance type. The state's IIS was found to be highly accurate, using individual chart review as the "gold standard."
   Discussion: While we demonstrated high maternal Tdap coverage in women delivering at our institution, differences in clinic type and provider training appeared to impact immunization rates, as well as how quickly evolving national recommendations were adopted. Additionally, the fidelity of the state's IIS data was verified. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Vaccination coverage rates for older adults are low. To better understand utilization of Medicare vaccination benefits we examined a retrospective cohort of more than 26 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries age 65 years and older from 2014 to 2017.
   Methods: Multivariate logistic regression was used to obtain marginal effects (ME) describing the association between patient-level characteristics and the likelihood of vaccination. Vaccines routinely recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-seasonal influenza, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate, and herpes zoster vaccines-were examined. Variables considered include demographics (e.g., age, sex, race), use of preventive services, frailty indicators, and co-morbidities.
   Results: The mean beneficiary age (SD) for each vaccine examined-seasonal influenza (2016-2017), pneumococcal, and herpes zoster-was 75.0 (7.9) years, 74.5 (7.5) years, 74.5 (7.4) years respectively; and 43.7%, 43.2%, and 39.5% were males respectively. Adjusted marginal effects showed that Black beneficiaries were less likely to receive any of the three vaccines compared to White beneficiaries, while North American Native beneficiaries were most likely to receive a pneumococcal vaccine. Trends by race and sex were similar across all ages. Beneficiaries utilizing preventive services, particularly cardiovascular disease screening (ME of 13.8%, 15.6% and 1.5% for influenza, pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccine respectively), other vaccinations, and the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (ME of 9.8%, 15.3% and 0.4% respectively) were predictors of vaccination for all three vaccines. For herpes zoster vaccines, beneficiaries in rural settings (ME of 1.0%) and those who are dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid insurance (ME of 1.7%) were more likely to receive herpes zoster vaccine than beneficiaries in urban settings and those not dual-eligible, respectively.
   Conclusion: Medicare beneficiaries of certain demographic with selected comorbid conditions are less likely to receive routinely-recommended vaccines. Strategies and interventions can target such sub-populations of Medicare beneficiaries by optimizing the utilization of preventive services. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   program, Cambodia-2017
SO VACCINE

   vaccine demonstration program; Cambodia
ID STRATEGIES
AB Background: In 2017, the Cambodia Ministry of Health introduced human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine through primarily school-based vaccination targeting 9-year-old girls. Vaccination with a two-dose series of HPV vaccine took place in six districts in two provinces as a demonstration program, to better understand HPV vaccine delivery in Cambodia.
   Methods: We conducted a community-based coverage survey using a one-stage sampling design to evaluate dose-specific vaccination coverage among eligible girls (those born in 2007 and residents in the areas targeted by the campaign). The household-level survey also assessed factors associated with vaccine acceptability and communication strategies. Trained data collectors interviewed caregivers and girls using a standard questionnaire; vaccination cards and health facility records were reviewed.
   Results: Of the 7594 households visited in the two provinces, 315 girls were enrolled in the survey (188 in Siem Reap; 127 in Svay Rieng). Documented two-dose HPV vaccination coverage was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78-88%) overall [85% (95% CI: 78-90%) in Siem Reap; 82% (95% CI: 73-88%) in Svay Rieng.) Almost all girls (>99%) were reported to be enrolled in school and over 90% of respondents reported receipt of vaccine in school. Knowledge of HPV infection and associated diseases was poor among caregivers and girls; however, 58% of caregivers reported "protection from cervical cancer" as the primary reason for the girl receiving vaccine. No serious adverse events after immunization were reported.
   Conclusions: The HPV vaccine demonstration program in Cambodia achieved high two-dose coverage among eligible girls in both provinces targeted for vaccination in 2017, through primarily school-based vaccination. High school enrollment and strong microplanning and coordination were seen throughout the campaign. Cambodia will use lessons learned from this demonstration program to prepare for national introduction of HPV vaccine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Data on duration of protection against invasive meningococcal disease post-vaccination with the recombinant, 4-component, meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) are limited. We evaluated bactericidal activity persistence in adolescents/young adults up to 7.5 years post-primary vaccination with 4CMenB, and response to a booster dose compared with vaccine-naive controls.
   Methods: This open-label, multicenter study (NCT02446743) enrolled 15-24 year-old-previously vaccinated participants from Canada, Australia (group Primed_4y) 4 years post-priming with 4CMenB (2 doses; 0,1-month schedule), and Chile (Primed_7.5y) 7.5 years after priming with 4CMenB (2 doses; 0,1/0,2/0,6-month schedule) and vaccine-naive participants of similar age (Naive_4y and Naive_7.5y groups). Primed participants received a booster dose; vaccine-naive participants received 2 catch-up doses of 4CMenB, 1 month apart. We evaluated antibody persistence and immune responses using hSBA in terms of geometric mean titers and percentages of participants with hSBA titers >= 4, the kinetics of bactericidal activity post-booster (previously vaccinated) or post-2 doses (vaccine-naive), and safety.
   Results: Antibody levels declined at 4 (Primed_4y) and 7.5 (Primed_7.5y) years post-primary vaccination, but remained higher than in vaccine-naive participants at baseline (<= 44% vs <= 13% [fHbp]; <= 84% vs <= 24% [NadA]; <= 29% vs <= 14% [Porn for all vaccine antigens except NHBA (<= 81% vs <= 79%). One month post-booster and post-second dose, 93-100% of primed and 79-100% of vaccine-naive participants had hSBA titers >= 4 for all antigens. Kinetics of the antibody response were similar across groups with an early robust response observed 7 days post-booster/second dose. No vaccine-related serious adverse event was reported.
   Conclusion: For all antigens except NHBA, a higher proportion of primed participants had hSBA titers >= 4, at 4 and 7.5 years post-vaccination, compared with vaccine-naive participants. A more robust immune response after booster compared to a first dose in vaccine-naive individuals, showed effective priming in an adolescent/young adult population. No safety or new reactogenicity issues were identified. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB CD8+ T cell-mediated immune response plays a major role in the clearance of virus-infected cells, including human papillomavirus (HPV). The effective treatment of women with normal cytology but persistent high risk-HPV infection or with low-grade intraepithelial lesions could take advantage of novel strategies based on vaccination with viral immunological targets with a wide spectrum of cross-protection. The helicase E1, expressed early during viral replication in HPV infection, is among the most conserved papillomavirus proteins, which makes it a good vaccine candidate. In the present study, we examined E1-specific CD8+ T cell and NK immune responses in a mouse model with alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) as an adjuvant. We found that mice immunized with El combined with alpha-GalCer elicited an E1-specific CD8+ T and NK cell cytotoxic responses, which correlated with growth inhibition of grafted melanoma B16-F0 cells expressing E1, both in prophylactic and therapeutic protocols.

AB Introduction: 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine (9vHPV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2014. 9vHPV is not recommended during pregnancy, but some women of childbearing age may be inadvertently exposed. This study aims to evaluate reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of pregnant women exposed to 9vHPV.
   Methods: We searched the VAERS database, a national post-licensure vaccine safety surveillance system, for reports of pregnant women vaccinated with 9vHPV in the United States between December 10, 2014 and December 31, 2017. Disproportionate reporting of adverse events (AEs) was assessed using proportional reporting ratios (PRRs).
   Results: A total of 82 pregnancy reports were identified. Sixty reports (73.2%) did not describe an AE and were submitted only to report the vaccine exposure during pregnancy. The most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE was spontaneous abortion (n = 3; 3.7%), followed by vaginal bleeding (n = 2; 2.4%). Among non-pregnancy-specific AEs, injection site reaction (n = 3; 3.7%) was most common. No disproportionate reporting of any AE was found.
   Discussion: No unexpected AEs were observed among these pregnancy reports. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   US claims database
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Zoster; Complications; Costs
ID COMORBIDITY INDEX; BURDEN; RATES
AB Background/Objectives: Herpes zoster (HZ) incidence increases with age, and the burden of HZ is expected to grow with aging of populations worldwide. We aim to determine the incremental healthcare resource utilization and associated costs of patients with common HZ-related complications other than postherpetic neuralgia (cutaneous, neurologic and ophthalmic) compared to uncomplicated HZ.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of commercial health insurance claims covering about 40 million immunocompetent individuals aged >= 50 years at study entry from all over the US, from 2008 to 2013, with follow-up for one year after HZ onset. All-cause healthcare resource utilization and direct healthcare costs were recorded and calculated from six months before until 12 months after HZ onset. The mean costs for HZ patients with complications were compared to the mean costs for patients with uncomplicated HZ. Multivariable regression analyses estimated mean incremental costs adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, type of complication and time period.
   Results: Over the five-year study period, 22,948 HZ patients (60% women, median age 62 years) who experienced at least one of the selected complications were compared to 213,232 patients (63% women, median age 61 years) with uncomplicated HZ. Overall, the mean annual incremental unadjusted costs for the patients with HZ-related complications were US$4716, ranging from US$2173 for ophthalmic to US $18,323 for neurologic complications. Most of the incremental costs associated with HZ complications were accrued during the first quarter after HZ onset. For each complication type the incremental costs increased with age up to, but not including the oldest group, aged >= 80 years.
   Conclusions: Approximately 10% of immunocompetent older patients with HZ develop complications which considerably increase the economic burden of HZ. Vaccination of older adults will offset some of the burden of HZ, including costs associated with HZ-related complications. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Cost analysis; Vaccine; Vaccine production; Developing country
ID DRUG
AB Developing country vaccine manufacturers (DCVMs) supply over half of the vaccines used in developing country immunisation programs. Decisions by developing countries to establish vaccine manufacturing should be based on economic viability, however reliable assessments of vaccine production costs are lacking. This study aimed to quantify the cost of establishing vaccine manufacturing facilities and producing vaccines in developing countries.
   This study estimates vaccine production costs in developing countries based on twelve vaccines produced by eight DCVMs. The results were based on estimates of the capital and operating costs required to establish vaccine manufacturing facilities under three hypothetical scenarios of production scale and scope. Cost patterns were then compared to vaccine prices paid by countries in both industrialized and developing country markets.
   The cost of producing vaccines in developing countries was estimated to be on average US$ 2.18 per dose, ranging between US$ 0.98 and US$ 4.85 for different vaccine types and formulations. Vaccine costs-per-dose decrease as production scale and scope increase. Cost-per-dose is mainly driven by fixed costs, but at a scale of production over 20 million doses per year it becomes driven by variable costs. Under the three hypothetical scenarios used, costs-per-dose of vaccines produced by developing countries were around 47% lower than vaccine prices in developing-country markets and 84% lower than prices in industrialized-country markets.
   This study has found that local production of vaccines in developing countries exhibits both economies of scale and economies of scope. The lower costs relative to prices suggests that a producer surplus and potential profits may be attainable in both developing and developed country markets, supporting sustainable production.

AB Mixed sugars derived from lignocellulosic biomass can be converted into biofuels and chemicals by engineered microorganisms, but toxic fermentation inhibitors produced from harsh depolymerization processes of lignocellulosic biomass pose a critical challenge for economic production of biofuels and chemicals. Unlike other fermentation inhibitors generated from sugar degradation, acetic acid is inevitably produced from acetylated hemicellulose, and its concentrations in cellulosic hydrolysates are substantially higher than other fermentation inhibitors. The aim of this study was to identify novel genetic perturbations for improved acetic acid tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through a genomic library-based approach, we identified an overexpression gene target RCK1 coding for a protein kinase involved in oxidative stress. Overexpression of RCK1 significantly improved glucose and xylose fermentation under acetic acid stress conditions. Specifically, the RCK1-overexpressing strain exhibited a two-fold higher specific ethanol productivity than the control strain in glucose fermentation under the presence of acetic acid. Interestingly, the engineered S. cerevisiae overexpressing RCK1 showed 40% lower intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as compared to the parental strain when the strains were exposed to acetic acid, suggesting that RCK1 overexpression might play a role in reducing the oxidative stress caused by acetic acid.

AB Bacillamide C, a potential natural antialgae active compound, is produced by Bacillus atrophaeus C89 derived from marine sponge Dysidea avara. A nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) cluster is hypothesized to be involved in the biosynthesis of bacillamide C. The NRPS with a domain string of A1-PCP1-Cy-A2-PCP2-C can be divided into three functional modules. After heterologous expression and purification of module A1-PCP1 and module Cy-A2-PCP2, their catalytic activities were biochemically proven in vitro by the reaction with the apo-PCP domain transformed to the holo-PCP domain through a phosphopantetheinyl transferase, ATP, and substrate amino acids. Five- membered heterocyclic AlaCys(thiazole) with molecular weight of 172.0389 was detected. This proved the formation of the heterocyclic dipeptide AlaCys(thiazole), which is considered to be a building block for the biosynthesis of bacillamide. This study provides a basis for further biosynthesis of bacillamides.

AB The hydrolysis step by beta-glucosidase (BGL) is generally recognized as the major limiting step in cellulose degradation and the BGLs with prominent enzymatic properties are of great importance for efficient utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. In order to identify some salt-tolerant BGLs, two BGL genes were cloned from marine Aspergillus niger ZJUBE-1 genome. Then two bgl expression cassettes driven by gpdA promoter were respectively transformed into marine A. niger for homologous constitutive expression. Directed expression was achieved for the domination of target BGLs in fermentation broth. Conveniently, two BGLs were purified to homogeneity by two separation steps, ultrafiltration and anion exchange chromatography. The purified BGL1 and BGL2 showed maximum activity at pH 3.0-4.0 and 3.5-4.5, respectively, suggesting these two BGLs were relatively acidophilic, especially for BGL1. Besides, BGL1 was stable to most of metal ions, while BGL2 was sensitive to Cu2+, Fe3+ and Ag+. Most specially, BGL2 activity increased by 44% in the presence of 4 M NaCl, suggesting BGL2 was halophilic. Homology modeling revealed that longer loops and linkers as well as polymerous Glu(492) may contribute to the halophilism of BGL2. At last, the medium for directed expression was optimized and the content as well as the purity of target protein was improved.

AB Streptomyces asterosporus DSM 41452 is a producer of the polyketide annimycin and the non-ribosomal depsipeptide WS9326A. This strain is also notable for exhibiting a bald phenotype that is devoid of spores and aerial mycelium when grown on solid media. Based on the similarity of the 16S rRNA sequence to Streptomyces calvus, the only known producer of the fluorometabolite nucleocidin, the genome of S. asterosporus DSM 41452 was sequenced and analyzed. Twenty-nine natural product gene clusters were detected in the genome, including a gene cluster predicted to encode the fluorometabolite nucleocidin. Through genome analysis and gene complementation experiments, we demonstrate that the bald phenotype arises from a transposon gene inserted within the promoter sequence for the pleiotropic regulator adpA. Complementation of S. asterosporus DSM 41452 with a functional adpA sequence restored morphological differentiation and promoted the production of nucleocidin.

AB The stabilization effects on a novel commercial beta-glucosidase preparation from Aspergillus fumigatus during saccharification of ethanol-water pretreated wheat straw were analysed in comparison to this enzyme stability during cellobiose hydrolysis. For this purpose, the kinetics of beta-glucosidase residual activity during cellobiose hydrolysis from 40 till 70 degrees C were studied, resulting in the fitting of a first-order partial deactivation model. Furthermore, a subsequent fitting of a kinetic model including this first-order deactivation equation and a Michaelis-Menten equation with double competitive inhibition by glucose and uncompetitive inhibition by cellobiose to released glucose was successful. Finally, global enzyme deactivation and prospective deactivation of enzyme remaining in the liquid phase were evaluated during wheat straw hydrolysis at 50 degrees C as a relevant saccharification process. Results suggest that the presence of a solid substrate dramatically reduces the global deactivation rate of the enzyme and, in addition, there is no loss the stability of the enzyme in the liquid phase along the saccharification process, even for 72 h.

AB Metal-driven papain-surfactant nanocomposite (PA@MSNC), a novel soft nanobiocatalyst, was successfully prepared via one-pot self-assembly technique in aqueous solution for the biosynthesis of N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-alanyl-L-glutamine (Z-Ala-Gln) dipeptide in deep eutectic solvents (DESs). The metal-driven self-assembly process generated PA@MSNC as nanospheres of (similar to)130 nm in diameter, with high protein loading and relative enzyme activity of 420 mg/g and 80% (4270 U/g protein), respectively. PA@MSNC showed high apparent substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency. The stability of PA@MSNC at high temperature and extreme pH was significantly higher than that of free PA. Catalysis efficiency for the biosynthesis of Z-Ala-Gln by PA@MSNC in choline chloride: glycerol reaction medium was 1.69-fold higher than that of free PA, achieving a high product yield of 75.7% within 4 h. PA@MSNC also showed better techno-economic performance. We propose that enzyme-surfactant nanocomposite via metal-driven dynamically reversible coordination interactions contribute simultaneously promotes catalytic flexibility and configurational stability. The generated PA@MSNC has potential practical implications for green synthesis of dipeptide in DESs.

AB A bioinspired strategy for the synthesis of supramolecular and biocatalytical materials was developed base on protein-protein supramolecular interaction and genetic engineering. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and its functional fragments were separately fused to form a multi-function domain. The fusion proteins and functional fragments self-assembled into the expanded and controllable supramolecular interaction networks. Morphology characterization by scanning-electron microscopy showed that the assembled functional fragments and fusion proteins formed multi-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) layer-like structures. Moreover, the oligomeric biocatalysts exhibited higher structural stability and NAD(H) recycling efficiency than the unassembled structures when they were applied to a co-enzyme regeneration system. These results suggest that the bioinspired strategy provides a promising approach for the fabrication of supramolecular FDH materials via genetic engineering and self-assembly. The significant improvement on the biocatalytical activity reveals the essential role of supramolecular interface design in their biocatalysis applications.

AB The present study investigated cold hydrolysis of cassava pulp (CP) and the use of cold hydrolysis with simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for ethanol production. Cold hydrolysis of 100 g-CP/L at 50 degrees C for 2 h, followed by at 30 degrees C for 72 h resulted in the production of 71.5 +/- 1.8 g/L of reducing sugar, with a yield of 0.72 g/g-CP. A mathematical model describing the cold hydrolysis process was subsequently developed. The model proved to be applicable for other cold hydrolysis systems with satisfactory results. The sequential process of cold hydrolysis at 50 degrees C for 2 h, followed by SSF at 30 degrees C for 72 h gave 27.4 g-ethanol/L, with a productivity of 0.37 g/(L h) and a fermentation efficiency of 57.58%. Based on the results, a bioconversion process for CP to ethanol was proposed. In this process, 1 kg of ethanol could be produced from 3.65 kg of CP without any nutrient supplementation.

AB Due to increasing resistance of Candida species to antifungal drugs, especially azoles, new drugs are needed. The proposed compounds 3 and 4 are analogous to a-asarone (2), a naturally occurring potent inhibitor of HMGR with hypolipidemic and antifungal activity. We used the recombinant enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase of Candida glabrata (CgHMGR) as a model to test the effectiveness of the test compounds. Compounds 3 and 4 demonstrated inhibitory kinetics, having lower IC50 values (42.65 mu M and 28.77 mu M, respectively) than compound 2 (> 100 mu M). The docking studies showed better binding energies for compounds 3 and 4 (-5.35 and -6.1 kcal/mol, respectively) than for compound 2 (-4.53 kcal/mol). These findings suggest that the tested compounds are better than their natural analogue. Plaque assays were performed on the C. glabrata strain CBS138 by applying ergosterol or cholesterol to evaluate the possible reversal of the inhibition induced by compounds 2, 3 and 4. Inhibition was easily suppressed in all three cases, recovering the viability of C. glabrata. These results reveal that the CgHMGR model is excellent for testing antifungals. Compound 4 produced the best effect and is herein proposed as a new potent antifungal agent.

AB In this study, a combined optimization strategy, based on co-expression of molecular chaperones and supplementation of osmolytes, was used to reduce the formation of inclusion bodies and enhance the expression of the soluble form of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase. The 4-alpha-glucanotransferase yield was enhanced by co-expression with pGro7 and supplementation of trimetlylamine oxide. Subsequently, the effects of process conditions (temperature, inducer concentration, and arabinose concentration) on cell growth and 4-alpha-glucanotransferase production were also investigated in shake flasks. In addition, a modified high-cell-density fermentation approach was proposed and applied in 3-L fermentor supplied with L-arabinose and trimetlylamine oxide, which achieved a dry cell weight of 65.92 g.L-1. Through this cultivation approach at 28 degrees C, the activity of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase reached 332.5 U.g(-1) dry cell weight, which was 24.6-fold greater than the initial activity in shake flask cultivation. This combined strategy is expected to provide an efficient and economical approach to overproduction of aggregation prone proteins on a large scale.

AB Approaches using metabolic engineering to produce D-1, 2, 4-butanetriol (BT) from renewable biomass in microbial systems have achieved initial success. However, due to the lack of incomplete understanding of the complex branch pathway, the efficient fermentation system for BT production was difficult to develop. Here we reconstituted a cell-free system in vitro using purified enzymes to produce BT from D-xylose. The factors that influencing the efficiency of cell-free system, including enzyme concentration, reaction buffer, pH, temperature, metal ion additives and cofactors were first identified to define optimal reaction conditions and essential components for the cascade reaction. Meanwhile, a natural cofactor recycling system was found in cell-free system. Finally, we were able to convert 18 g/L xylose to 6.1 g/L BT within 40 h with a yield of 48.0%. The feasibility of cell-free system to produce BT in corncob hydrolysates was also determined.

AB Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in numerous of human cancer tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the in-depth molecular mechanism that lncRNAs regulate the gliomagenesis is still ambiguous. In this research, our study invests energy in the biologic roles of lncRNA DLX6-AS1 on the glioma tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrated that DLX6-AS1 expression was both high-expressed in the glioma cells and tissue, and the overexpression of DLX6-AS1 was clinically correlated with the poor outcome of glioma patients. In the cellular functional assays, silenced DLX6-AS1 expression by siRNAs inhibited the proliferation, invasion and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, while the enhanced DLX6-AS1 expression by plasmids promotes them. The bioinformatics predictive tools, luciferase reporter assay and correlation analysis found that miR-197-5p could both target the 3'-UTR of DLX6-AS1 as well as E2F1 gene, constructing DLX6-AS1-miR-197-5p-E2F1 axis. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that lncRNA DLX6-AS1 has valuable diagnostic value clinical diagnose for the glioma patients (AUC = 0.736). Overall, our finding supports that DLX6-AS1 accelerates the glioma carcinogenesis by competing endogenous sponging miR-197-5p to relieve E2F1, acting as a novel therapeutic target for glioma.

AB Objective: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in elderly individuals in the developed countries. The etiology of AMD is thought to be multifactorial, including environmental and genetic factors. Our purpose was to determine the genotype frequencies of six different SNPs in genes that encode proteins involved in AMD-related molecular changes (SIRT1 rs12778366, FGFR2 rs2981582, STAT3 rs744166, LIPC rs10468017, rs493258 and LPL rs12678919) for evaluation of haplotype risk in patients with AMD.
   Methods: The study cohort consisted of 652 AMD patients and 829 healthy controls. The genotyping was carried out using the RT-PCR.
   Results: TT genotype of the LIPC rs493258 polymorphism was associated with decreased odds of early AMD development under the codominant and recessive models (OR = 0.446; 95% CI: 0.258-0.772; p = 0.004 and OR = 0.455; 95% CI: 0.274-0.756; p = 0.002, respectively) after Bonferroni correction, (p > 0.05/6, since we analyzed 6 different SNPs). The haplotype containing the two minor alleles T-T in rs10468017-rs493258 were significantly (p = 0.034) associated with early AMD development decreasing. There were no associations found with atrophic AMD development.
   Conclusion: The study showed that LIPC rs493258 gene and haplotype containing the two minor alleles T-T in rs10468017-rs493258 may decrease AMD development.

AB Lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A), as a candidate gene associated with skeletal dysplasia and the differentiation of osteogenesis, might affect the growth traits in animals. In the previous study (Cui et al., 2018), one 16 by intronic insertion/deletion (NW_017189516.1: g.138, 431_138,446delAATGTATAGCTTAAAA) within the KDM6A gene significantly influenced KDM6A gene expression. The objective of this work was to investigate the association between this 16 bp indel and growth-related traits in Shaanbei White Cashmere goat (SWCG). Association analyses showed the 16 bp indel was related to growth traits strongly (body height, chest depth, height across the hip, body length and chest circumference) in SWCG population (n = 1953, P < 0.05). Insertion/insertion (II) genotype individuals (n = 1502) had the best growth traits, by comparison of those of insertion/deletion (ID) (n = 410) and the deletion/deletion (DD) genotypes (n = 41). Particularly, the body weight of II genotype individuals were significantly higher than ID and DD genotypes (P < 0.01). Besides, the remarkable influence of this indel on traits might cause by the change of MEF2 binding site. These findings hinted that the 16 bp deletion mutation in KDM6A gene, which was significantly associated with growth-related traits, could be assigned to an effective molecular marker for growth traits in goat breeding.

AB Aminotransferases are widely employed as biocatalysts to produce chiral amines and biologically active pharmaceuticals via asymmetric synthesis. In this study, transaminase genes in the Bacillus pumilus W3 genome were analysed, and gene ota3 encoding a putative (R)-selective transaminase was identified. The sequence of ota3 shares highest sequence identity (24.7%) with the first (R)-selective aminotransferase from Arthrobacter sp. KNK 168. Amino acid sequence and conserved domains analyses indicated that omega-BPAT encoded by ota3 belonged to the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent class IV (PLPDE_IV) superfamily. Both native and codon-optimised omega-BPAT genes were recombinantly expressed, and the purified proteins had a molecular mass of similar to 33.4 kDa. Furthermore, enantioselectivity tests with (S)- and (R)-alpha-phenethylamine revealed its (R)-selectivity. The optimal conditions for catalytic reaction were 45 degrees C and pH 7.0, and omega-BPAT retained stability at 20 degrees C and pH 7.0. Thus, omega-BPAT is a novel (R)-selective aminotransferase with great potential as a universal biocatalyst.

AB Superoxide dismutase is a key enzyme that scavenges superoxide anion and plays vital roles in plant antioxidant system. This study identified six SOD genes from the deciduous conifer Larix kaempferi, which is widely distributed across the cooler regions of the northern hemisphere. These six SOD genes were classified into three types: Cu/Zn-SOD (LkSOD1, 2, 3 and 4), Fe-SOD (LkSOD5) and Mn-SODs (LkSOD6). Three Cu/Zn-SOD proteins (LkSOD1, 3 and 4) were cytosolic-localized, while the other three proteins (LkSOD2, 5 and 6) were chloroplast-localized. Larix SOD proteins displayed catalytic activities toward superoxide anion, and retained > 55% of its maximum enzymatic activity between 10 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Over expressions of three Larix SOD genes (LkSOD2, 4 and 6) in Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively, showed increased germination rates and root lengths during salt stress. LkSOD5 gene could rescue pale green and dwarf phenotype of Arabidopsis atfsd2-2 mutant. Taken together, this study provided comprehensive insight into the gymnosperm SOD gene family.

AB The vital roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the cancers have been evidenced. However, there are still numerous unsolved queries for the molecular mechanism. This study tries to investigate the role of lncRNA FOXC2-AS1 in the human prostate cancer tumorigenesis. Results stated that lncRNA FOXC2-AS1 was ectopically up-regulated in prostate cancer tissue and cells. The over-expression of FOXC2-AS1 indicates the poor prognosis of prostate cancer patients. Functionally, the gain- and loss-of-functional experiments revealed that FOXC2-AS1 promoted the proliferation and tumor growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, we found that miR-1253 targeted FOXC2-AS1 at the 3'-untranslated regions (UTR), which in turn bind the EZH2 mRNA 3-UTR. Luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiment confirmed the FOXC2-AS1/miR-1253/EZH2 pathway. In conclusion, we confirmed that lncRNA FOXC2-AS1 accelerated the tumor progression of prostate cancer cells by regulating the proliferation and tumor growth through miR-1253/EZH2 axis.

AB Papaya leaf curl virus (PaLCuV) is a begomovirus (genus Begomovirus; family Geminiviridae) with a monopartite genome that is usually associated with beta- and alphasatellites in plants. Geminiviruses are DNA viruses with small circular genomes that occur as minichromosomes in the nucleus and are susceptible to post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). Transient expression of the PaLCuV V2 (PV2) protein together with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in enhanced levels of GFP fluorescence and GFP mRNA, indicative of suppression of PTGS. Expression of PV2 from a Potato virus X vector restored GFP expression in N. benthamiana plants harbouring a transcriptionally silenced GFP transgene, indicative of suppression of TGS. The results show that the PV2 protein encoded by PaLCuV has both suppressor of PTGS and TGS activity and is an important factor in overcoming host RNA-silencing based defenses.

AB The etiology of hearing loss tends to be multi-factorial and affects a significant proportion of the global population. Despite the differences in etiology, a common physical pathological change that leads to hearing loss is damage to the mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play a role in inner ear development and thus, may play a role in the development or prevention of hearing loss. In this paper, we review the mechanism of action of miRNAs in the auditory system. We present an overview about the role of miRNAs in inner ear development, summarize the current research on the role of miRNAs in gene regulation, and discuss the effects of both miRNA mutations as well as overexpression. We discuss the crucial role of miRNAs in ensuring normal physiological development of the inner ear. Any deviation from the proper function of miRNA in the cochlea seems to contribute to deleterious damage to the structure of the auditory system and subsequently results in hearing loss. As interest for miRNA research increases, this paper serves as a platform to review current understandings and postulate future avenues for research. A better knowledge about the role of miRNA in the auditory system will help in developing novel treatment modalities for restoring hearing function based on regeneration of damaged inner ear hair cells.

AB Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a pathological process that induces oxidative stress, hepatocyte apoptosis, autophagy, and increased inflammatory cytokines. The process can result in liver injury and dysfunction. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with the process of I/R; however, the underlying mechanism is not clear. The present study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of lncRNA HOTAIR on autophagy during hepatic I/R injury. The expression levels of HOTAIR, LC3, and ATG7 were examined in a hepatic I/R model. We found that HOTAIR and ATG7 expression levels were upregulated and the autophagy level was significantly increased during I/R liver injury. In isolated hepatocytes, knockdown of the expression of HOTAIR attenuated autophagy induced by hydrogen peroxide. Using the bioinformatics database of TargetScan and starbase, we predicted microRNA miRNA-20b-5p might participate in the regulation between HOTAIR and ATG7. The miR-20b-5p level was significantly decreased in I/R livers and was identified to target ATG7 and inhibit its expression. In addition, HOTAIR can function as competing endogenous RNA for miR-20b-5p and attenuates its inhibitory effect on ATG7. Taken together, our findings revealed that HOTAIR regulates autophagy via the miR-20b-5p/ATG7 axis in hepatic I/R injury, which may serve as basis to develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat hepatic I/R injury.

AB Drug-resistance of platinum remains a big challenge for effective treatment of patients with ovarian cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and are associated with multi drug resistance. Our study aims on identifying role of miRNAs in drug-resistance of platinum in ovarian cancer. In present study, we compared the expression profiles of miRNAs between three pairs of platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive ovarian tissues and found that miR-509-3p was significantly down-regulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer tissues. The different expression of miR-509-3p was further determined by RT-qPCR analyses of tissue samples from groups of 20 patients with cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer and 7 patients with cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer. Functional studies demonstrated that miR-509-3p inhibitor decreased cell response to cisplatin (CDDP) and promoted cell survival in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, we found gene expression level of Golgi phosphoprotein-3 (GOLPH3) and wntless Wnt ligand secretion mediator (WLS) were regulated by miR-509-3p. The direct bindings of miR-509-3p to GOLPH3 and WLS genes were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. And the negative correlation between their expression levels in SKOV3 cells was further verified with RT-qPCR. Altogether, our data provide preliminary evidence, supporting that targeting miR-509-3p might be a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

AB Interleukin-17 (IL17) family cytokines are well known for having pro-inflammatory actions as important mediators of mucosal immune responses and are tightly regulated by various kinds of signals. However, most studies of IL17 genes have focused on mammals, and much less is known about IL17 genes in fish species. To better understand the scope and actions of the IL17 gene family in common carp, we characterized seven IL17 gene homologs from genomic and transcriptomic databases that could be classified into three subclasses according to different comparative genomic analyses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most IL17s are highly conserved, though recent gene duplication and gene loss events do exist. Through observation, we found that IL17D has undergone gene duplication in common carp and that all the IL17E genes were lost in vertebrates except mammals. The expression patterns of IL17 genes in common carp were examined during early developmental stages and in various healthy tissues, and the results indicated that most IL17 genes are ubiquitously expressed during early development and show particular tissue-specific expression in various healthy tissues, with relatively high levels in the spleen, liver, and kidney. To gain insights into the mucosal actions of inflammatory processes, the expression profiles of IL17 genes in gills from common carp were investigated after experimental challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila. After A. hydrophila infection, most IL17 genes were upregulated at 4 h postinfection in the gill and then gradually declined, while IL17A/F2 and IL17N were generally upregulated at 12 h postinfection, and IL17D2 maintained an increasing tendency. In contrast, IL17D showed the third phenomenon, rising expression, suggesting that immunogenes have different response strategies to bacterial invasion. Overall, the expression of IL17 in unstimulated tissues and toxicity attack test results demonstrated that these genes play critical roles under normal conditions and during bacterial infection. Moreover, this common carp IL17 gene family research provides a genomic resource for future studies on IL17 gene evolution, fish disease management and immune regulation.

AB Currently, there are two subspecies of the chestnut tiger butterfly (Parantica sita) recognized in China. P. s. sita is widely distributed in southwest China and P. s. niphonica in Taiwan. Periodically, Taiwan Island and the Chinese mainland have been connected and separated because of sea level changes caused by Pleistocene glaciations, most likely influencing the genetic structure among P. sita populations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Also, P. s. niphonica's well-documented long-distance migration may have influenced genetic differentiation within this species as well. So, investigation of the genetic differentiation of these two subspecies is well warranted. In this study, we sequenced the complete mitogenome (15,156 bp in length) of P. s. sita and its general characteristics agreed with general butterfly mitogenomic characteristics. However, when compared genetically with P. s. niphonica, P. s. sita diverged substantially. First, there were 4.1% variable sites between these two subspecies, with 5.3% at COI and 3.8% at COII, differences much greater than those expected of general interspecific divergences in butterflies. Second, there was a 59 bp fragment deletion in the A + T rich region of P. s. sita and, third, the relationships of these two subspecies and P. luzonensis could not be distinguished using Bayesian inference and P. s. niphonica first clustered with P. luzonensis, rather than P. s. sita, using maximum likelihood. Based on these results, we propose that P. s. sita and P. s. niphonica are independent species instead of subspecies. This proposal should be clarified through further research.

AB Identification of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene amplification status is critically important in the effective management of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. Earlier reports suggested that overexpression of BCR-ABL1 either through amplification of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene or by the up regulation of BCR-ABL1 transcript level might be an early phenomenon in the establishment of IM resistance and disease evolution in CML. In the current study, we performed dual color dual fusion locus specific BCR/ABL1 FISH analysis along with karyotype analysis using GTG banding (G-banding using trypsin and Giemsa) technique in 489 patients with different clinical stages of CML at diagnosis or during the course of the disease to unravel the spectrum of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene amplification status. Among the study group analyzed, it was found that prevalence of occurrence of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene amplification was significantly higher in advanced stages of disease and in IM resistant CML-CP patients when compared to initial stage of disease, de novo CML-CP. Cytogenetic and metaphase FISH characterization on our study samples revealed that BCR-ABL1 fusion gene amplification was occurred through the formation of extra copies Ph chromosomes and isoderived Ph chromosomes. Current study suggests that unrestrained activity of BCR-ABL1 played a vital role in resistance to targeted therapy and disease evolution in CML. In our study population, patients in progressive stage CML and in IM resistant CP with multiple copies of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene displayed a poor response to targeted treatment with IM. Hence, the early identification of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene amplification using FISH technique will lead to improved interventions and outcome in future CML patients.

AB The current study examined the liver transcriptomic profiles of the Large White different in developmental periods. It was performed on pigs of two developmental stages: 70-day fetus (P70) and 70-day piglets (D70). The objective of the study was to identify genes associated with Large White liver lipid metabolism, growth and development. We sequenced eight sRNA libraries of liver samples from four Large White at P70 and D70 respectively. We totally obtained 19,202 genes. 4916 of them were found to be differentially expressed (DEGs) (p < 0.05, fold change >= 1), of which 2502 were up-regulated and 2414 were down-regulated. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that ACACA, ACADM, ACAA2 and HADH were simultaneously enriched in diverse pathways related to lipid metabolism, and so they were considered to be the promising candidate genes which could affect the porcine liver lipid metabolism. Notably, the gene insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGE1) which participated in somatotropic axis signaling was found to be up-regulated in D70 compared with P70. miRWalk and TargetScan softwares were used to screen the miRNAs which bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of IGF1. After integration analysis with miRNAs sequencing data, miR-18b and miR-130b-3p were selected for further study. MiR-18b and miR-130b-3p were down-regulated in D70 compared with P70. Dual luciferase assays indicated that miR-18b and miR-130b-3p could obviously decrease (p < 0.05) the fluorescence activity of the group transfected with the wild-type vector of IGF1 3'UTR, while the relative luciferase activity of the group transfected with the mutant vector of IGF1 3'UTR did not change significantly. Taken together, it indicated that miR-18b and miR-130b-3p could target IGF1 directly.

AB Blueberries (Vaccinium ssp.) show relatively high resistance to pollution and have been reported to successfully colonize acid and heavy metal-contaminated soils. Blueberries were subjected to cadmium stress using a simulated pot-culture method. The intact CDS regions of VcCXIP4 and VcYSL6 were obtained, VcCXIP4 was located in the nucleus, while VcYSL6 was located in the chloroplast. Both genes were constructed into a modified plant expression vector pCambia1301 for tobacco transformation with agrobacterium infection methods. Results showed that VcCXIP4 did not function alone in regulating cadmium (Cd) transport. Cd content of Cd in the leaves of VcYSL6 transgenic tobacco by 15.57% under high Cd concentration. Both, VcCXIP4 and VcYSL6 genes were up-regulated under Cd stress. Blueberry primarily accumulated excess Cd in the root, but Cd content in the fruit was almost independent of Cd content in the soil. Further, the effect of soil Cd content on fruit Cd content was not significant. VcCXIP4 is likely to interact with other proteins to regulate excess Cd in blueberry, while VcYSL6 is a Cd transporter required for excess Cd detoxification in blueberry.

AB EphB3 is a member of the EPH family of receptors and has been found to play a role in the carcinogenesis of some human cancers. However, its expression and clinical significance in gastric cancer (GC) have not been well documented. In the present study, we detected the expression of EphB3 in GC and adjacent noncancerous tissues and explored its relationships with the clinicopathological features and prognosis of GC patients. It was found that EphB3 silenced GC cells epigenetically by direct transcriptional repression of GC cells via polycomb group protein EZH2 mediation. EphB3 was downregulated in GC cells and tissues, and EphB3 depletion promoted GC cell growth and invasion, while ectopic overexpression of EphB3 produced a significant anti-tumor effect. EphB3 was found to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition by regulating E-cadherin and vimentin expression. In addition, patients with reduced EphB3 expression had shorter disease-free survival (DFS), indicating that EphB3 may prove to be a biomarker for prognosis of GC. These results demonstrated that EphB3 functioned as a tumor-suppressor and prognostic biomarker in GC.

AB The WFDC1 gene is frequently down-regulated or lost in prostate cancer, and the encoded protein, ps20, has been implicated in epithelial cell behaviour and angiogenesis. However, ps20 remains largely uncharacterised with respect to its structure and interacting partners. This study characterised the evolution, functionality and structural characteristics of WFDC1/ps20 using phylogenetic reconstruction and other computational approaches. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses suggested that ps20 appeared in a common ancestor of deuterostomesprotostomes. The rate of evolutionary change within the coding regions of vertebrate WFDC1 genes and the synteny conservation in mammals differed from that of other vertebrate clades, indicating a possible functional diversity of ps20 homologues. A gene set enrichment analysis of the genes around WFDC1 (conserved synteny) showed functional relationships between the WFDC1, CDH13, CRISPLD2, IRF8 and TFPI2 genes. The molecular evolution of ps20 has been driven by purifying selection, particularly in the segments corresponding to exons 3 and 4, which encode the most conserved regions of the protein. A co-evolution analysis showed that residues within these regions co-vary with each other during the evolution of ps20. These results show that the regions corresponding to exons 3 and 4 are ps20-specific structure-function modules. Homology modelling of the exon 2-encoded polypeptide and subsequent dynamics calculus using a Gaussian network model showed that residues with high conformational flexibility are part of a loop region involved in protein-protein recognition, given the similarity with other serine protease inhibitors. Residues C96, R94, L105, and C66 are critical for the integrity and functionality of this ps20 region.

AB Gene duplication could promote phenotypic and genetic adaptation to various environments. To understand the effects of gene duplication on transcriptional regulation associated with environmental changes, we focused on the starch hydrolysis pathway, in which amylase enzymes together with maltase enzymes hydrolyze starch into glucose. Drosophila genomes involve ten duplicated Maltase genes. We examined the levels of transcription of the nine of these genes in 36 lines of Drosophila melanogaster collected from a natural population. In the investigated population, the levels of transcription were different between the two dietary carbohydrate sources, glucose and starch. At the transcriptional level, a single Maltase gene, which transcribes the specific Maltase transcripts, worked together with an Amylase gene in the pathway. The three of nine genes responded to carbohydrate changes, and the degree of the response was similar to Amylase gene. Our results suggest that gene duplication could increase capacity of the transcriptional regulation associated with environmental changes.

AB Over a decade ago, a landmark study that reported derivation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) by reprogramming fibroblasts has transformed stem cell research attracting the interest of the scientific community worldwide. These cells circumvent the ethical and immunological concerns associated with embryonic stem cells, and the limited self-renewal ability and restricted differentiation potential linked to adult stem cells. iPSCs hold great potential for understanding basic human biology, in vitro disease modeling, high-throughput drug testing and discovery, and personalized regenerative medicine. The conventional reprogramming methods involving retro- and lenti-viral vectors to deliver reprogramming factors in somatic cells to generate iPSCs nullify the clinical applicability of these cells. Although these gene delivery systems are efficient and robust, they carry an enormous risk of permanent genetic modifications and are potentially tumorigenic. To evade these safety concerns and derive iPSCs for human therapy, tremendous technological advancements have resulted in the development of non-integrating viral- and non-viral approaches. These gene delivery techniques curtail or eliminate the risk of any genomic alteration and enhance the prospects of iPSCs from bench-to-bedside. The present review provides a comprehensive overview of non-integrating viral (adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, and Sendai virus vectors) and DNA-based, non-viral (plasmid transfection, minicircle vectors, transposon vectors, episomal vectors, and liposomal magnetofection) approaches that have the potential to generate transgene-free iPSCs. The understanding of these techniques could pave the way for the use of iPSCs for various biomedical applications.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) gene (rs1982073 and rs1800471) and congenital heart disease (CUD) susceptibility.
   Methods: Totally, 145 CHD patients and 140 healthy controls were enrolled in this case-control study. The case and control groups were matched in age and gender. Genotyping for TGF beta 1 gene SNPs rs1982073 and rs1800471 was conducted via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) approach. Chi-square test was used to analyze the association of TGF beta 1 polymorphisms with CHD risk. The results were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: The frequencies of the CT genotype and T allele of TGF beta 1 gene SNP rs1982073 were significantly different between cases and controls (P < 0.05), revealing their associations with reduced susceptibility to CHD (OR = 0.521, 95%CI = 0.302-0.897; OR = 0.706, 95%CI = 0.507-0.983). Nevertheless, TGF beta 1 gene SNP rs1800471 had no significant association with CHD susceptibility (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: TGF beta 1 gene SNP rs1982073 might be correlated with CHD susceptibility, and the T allele might decrease the disease risk. However, TGF beta 1 gene polymorphism rs1800471 was not related to CHD risk.

AB Electric fishes are a diverse group of freshwater organisms with the ability to generate electric organ discharges (EODs) that are used for communication and electrolocation. This group (ca. 200 species) has originated in South America, and six species colonized the Central American Isthmus. Here, we assembled the complete mitochondria! genomes (mitogenomes) for three Central American electric fishes (i.e. Sternopygus dariensis, Brachyhypopomus occidentalis, and Apteronotus rostratus), and, based on these data, explored their phylogenetic position among Gymnotiformes. The three mitogenomes show the same gene order, as reported for other fishes, with a size ranging from 16,631 to 17,093 bp. We uncovered a novel 60 by intergenic spacer (IGS) located between the Con and tRNA(Lys) genes, which appears to be unique to the Apteronotidae. Furthermore, phylogenetic relationships supported the traditional monophyly of Gymnotiformes, with the three species positioned within their respective family. In addition, the genus Apteronotus belongs to the early diverging lineage of the order. Finally, we found high sequence divergence (13%) between our B. occidentalis specimen and a sequence previously reported in GenBank, suggesting that the prior mitogenome of B. occidentalis represents a different South American species. Indeed, phylogenetic analyses using Cytochrome b gene across the genus placed the previously reported individual within B. bennetti. Our study provides novel mitogenome resources that will advance our understanding of the diversity and phylogenetic history of Neotropical fishes.

AB It is well recognized that the association of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical carcinogenesis is based on the presence of HPV DNA sequence. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins encoded by high-risk HPV types play a key role in carcinogenesis. HPV58 type accounts for a larger share of cervical disease in China, whereas data on HPV58 genetic variability in China is limited. We aimed to evaluate the diversity of HPV58 genetic variants by sequencing the entire E6 and E7 genes. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by Maximum likelihood method by MEGA 5.05 software. In this study, the overall HPV infection rate was 22.6% (2891/12780) in Southeast China and the prevalence of HPV58 infection rate was 2.6% (335/12780). 26 nucleotides substitutions were observed in E6 and E7 genes with 10 novel substitutions and 17 non-synonymous substitutions. We obtained 25 distinct variation patterns which the accession GenBank numbers as MH348918-MH348942. All of HPV58 variants belong to lineage A, while no lineage B, C and D were detected in Taizhou area, Southeast China. The sublineage Al, A2, and A3 variants were found in 136 (68.3%), 39 (19.6%), and 24 (12.1%) of HPV58 isolates, respectively. The sublineage A3 variants with T201/G63S substitutions at E7 oncoprotein carried a significantly higher risk for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2 or worse, CIN2 +) when compared with other HPV58 variants (odds ratio = 4.41, P < 0.05). Nevertheless, there was no association between HPV58 (sub) lineages and cervical lesions. These data provide the critical characteristics of HPV58 variants to assist further investigation of carcinogenic association and the development of next generation vaccines and diagnostic assays in China.

AB Glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GRPs) contain RNA recognition motif (RRM) and glycine-rich domains at the N- or C-terminus, respectively, and they participate in varied physiological and biochemical processes, as well as environmental stresses. Sweet potato from the genus Ipomoea is one of the most important crops. However, the role of the GRP gene family in Ipomoea plant species has not been reported yet. At the same time, the genome of sweet potato remains to be elucidated, but the genome of I. trifida which is most probably the progenitor of the sweet potato was released recently. In this regard, we carried out genome-wide analysis of GRP family members in I. trifida. Here, we identified nine GRP genes in I. trifida and investigated their motif distribution, promoters and gene structure. Subsequently, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the GRP genes from I. trifida, Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays L. and Oryza saliva to investigate their phylogenetic relationship. Moreover, we studied the expression patterns of ItGRPs in the roots, stems, young and mature leaves and flowers and found that ItGRP genes were tissue-specific. Meanwhile, the expression profiles under four abiotic stress conditions, including heat, cold, salt and drought stress treatments, revealed that some genes were markedly up-regulated or down-regulated. Taken together, our findings will provide reference to studies on the function of GRP genes in the development and stress response of L trifida.

AB Objectives: Large-scale association studies that mainly involve European populations identified many genetic loci related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, one of the most important indicators of the risk for cardiovascular diseases. The question with intense speculation of whether the effect estimates obtained from European populations for different HDL-C level-related SNPs are applicable to the Roma ethnicity, the largest minority group in Europe with a South Asian origin, was addressed in the present study.
   Design: The associations between 21 SNPs (in the genes LIPC(G), CETP, GALNT2, HMGCP, ABCA1, KCTD10 and WWOX) and HDL-C levels were examined separately in adults of the Hungarian general (N = 1542) and Roma (N = 646) populations by linear regression. Individual effects (direction and size) of single SNPs on HDL-C levels were computed and compared between the study groups and with data published in the literature.
   Results: Significant associations between SNPs and HDL-C levels were more frequently found in general subjects than in Roma subjects (11 SNPs in general vs. 4 SNPs in Roma). The CETP gene variants rs1532624, rs708272 and rs7499892 consistently showed significant associations with HDL-C levels across the study groups (p (<) 0.05), indicating a possible causal variant(s) in this region. Although nominally significant differences in effect size were found for three SNPs (rs693 in gene APOB, rs9989419 in gene CETP, and rs2548861 in gene WWOX) by comparing the general and Roma populations, most of these SNPs did not have a significant effect on HDL-C levels. The p coefficients for SNPs in the Roma population were found to be identical both in direction and magnitude to the effect obtained previously in large-scale studies on European populations.
   Conclusions: The effect of the vast majority of the SNPs on HDL-C levels could be replicated in the Hungarian general and Roma populations, which indicates that the effect size measurements obtained from the literature can be used for risk estimation for both populations.

AB Previous studies have proposed that caloric restriction (CR) regulates many cell functions and prolongs the lifespan of an organism. Our previous studies proposed that CR also prevents follicular activation and preserves the ovarian reserve in mice by activating SIRT1. To test if SIRT1 preserves the ovarian reserve and prolongs the ovarian longevity, we generated SIRT1 knock-in mice that can overexpress SIRT1 in oocytes of the mouse. Ovaries of the mice at ages 35 days and 15 months were collected, and the follicular development and follicular reserve were examined. The vaginal opening and onset of estrus of transgenic female mice (both the homozygous and heterozygous for SIRT1 overexpression) were later than that of wild-type mice. Both the homozygous and heterozygous SIRT1-overexpressing mice had a larger and stronger reproductive capacity than wild-type mice. Moreover, 35-day-old and 15-month-old homozygous and heterozygous SIRT1-overexpressing mice also had a higher mean number and percentage of healthy follicles, fewer atretic follicles than wild-type mice, and the mean number and percentage of primordial follicles in both the homozygous and heterozygous SIRT1-overexpressing mice were higher than wild-type mice at the same age. However, the phenotypes of heterozygous and homozygous transgenic mice came no difference. Immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of SIRT1 and FOX03a, and decreased expression of mTOR in both the homozygous and heterozygous SIRT1-overexpressing mice compared with wild-type mice. Thus, oocyte-specific SIRT1-overexpressing mice continuously activate FOX03a and suppress mTOR and have a larger reproductive capacity, larger follicle reserve and longer ovarian lifespan.

AB In recent years, in vitro three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems that better mimic in vivo physiology and tissue microenvironment have become important. It is used for the pre-clinical evaluation of the efficacy and safety profiles of new drug candidates developed especially for the treatment of various diseases including cancer. 3D cell culture techniques overcome the inadequacy of conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture models as they are much more informative than the 2D systems. And they can easily replace or reduce the number of in vivo studies which arise many ethical problems in the development of novel therapeutics. This review focuses on the organoid cultures which are 3D bioengineered cell culture systems that guide cell behavior and cell order to mimic in vivo tumor microenvironment.

AB Objective: Colchicum pusillum belongs to the family Colchicaceae that particularly rich in tropolonic alkaloids. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxicity and in vitro anticancer activity of Colchicum pusillum ethanolic extract on Colo-320 primer and Colo-741 metastatic colon adenocarcinoma cell lines.
   Materials and methods: Colchicum pusillum was collected and extracted with ethanol. Different concentrations of Colchicum pusillum extract were incubated for 24 h and 48 h with Colo-320 and Colo-741 cells. Cell growth and cytotoxicity were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Anticancer and antiproliferative activities of Colchicum pusillum were investigated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies directed against to beta-catenin, Ki-67, LGR-5 Ki-67, DKK1, Frizzled-4, Wnt4, Wnt7a and caspase3 in Colo-741 cells.
   Results: All concentrations of Colchicum pusillum extract had toxic effect in Colo-320 cells. Because of this, we used Colchicum pusillum extract at 20 mu g/ml for evaluate anticancer activities only in Colo-741 cells. As a result of immunohistochemical staining, beta-catenin, LGR-5 and caspase-3 immunoreactivities were significantly increased while Wnt7a immunostaining intensity was decreased in Colo-741 cells.
   Conclusion We conclude that Colchicum pusillum extract increased beta-catenin and LGR-5 via Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in colon cancer cells. Interestingly, it decreased other signaling molecule, Wnt7a which is assumed to play protective role during carcinogenesis. Also, it increased significantly caspase-3 immunoreactivity showing that apoptotic pathways were triggered.

AB The morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer (PCa) in China have increased obviously, which became the second leading cause of death in men with cancer. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is a key signaling pathway involved in the prostate cancer progression. The human oncogene SCL/TAL1 interrupting locus (STIL) can modulate the Hh signaling pathway, but its function in PCa has not been reported. Here, we showed that STIL was increased in high grade prostate cancer tissue. Knockdown of STIL in prostate cancer cells PC-3 and DU 145 significantly decreased the proliferation of cells and induced cellular apoptosis through casepase3/7 mediated pathway. Moreover, the colony formation ability was also inhibited when knockdown of STIL by lentivirus-mediated shRNA. Furthermore, the cellular signaling antibody array analysis revealed which signaling pathway was affected when silencing STIL. Altogether, we found that STIL could affect MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt and AMPK signaling pathways, thus promoting cellular proliferation, colony formation and suppressing cellular apoptosis in prostate cancer.

AB Objectives: Examine the association of genetic polymorphisms with age at menarche (AAM) in Russian women.
   Study design: A total of 1613 Russian females were recruited for the study. Fifty two polymorphisms were analyzed for their association with AAM, height, and BMI. The associations were analyzed assuming the additive, dominant, and recessive models and using the log linear regression as implemented in PLINK v. 2.050. The 2-, 3-, and 4-loci models of gene-gene interactions were analyzed using the MB-MDR method and validated by the permutation test.
   Main outcome measures: Genetic polymorphism rs6438424 3q13.32 was independently associated with AAM in Russian women. In addition, 14 SNPs were determined as possible contributors to this trait through gene-gene interactions.
   Results: The obtained results suggest that 14 out of 52 studied polymorphisms may contribute to AAM in Russian women. The rs6438424 3q13.32 polymorphism was associated with AAM according to both additive and dominant models (p(perm) = 0.005). In total 12 two-, three-, and four-locus models of gene-gene interactions were determined as contributing to AAM (p(perm) <= 0.006). Nine of the 14 AAM-associated SNPs are also associated with height and BMI (p(perm) <= 0.003). Among 14 AAM-associated SNPs (a priori all having regulatory significance), the highest regulatory potential was determined for rs4633 COMT, rs2164808 POMC, rs2252673/NSR, rs6438424 3q13.32, and rs10769908 STK33. Eleven loci are cis-eQTL and affect expression of 14 genes in various tissues and organs (FDR < 0.05). The neuropeptide-encoding genes were overrepresented among the AAM-associated genes (P-bonf = 0.039).
   Conclusions: The rs6438424 polymorphism is independently associated with AAM in Russian females in this study. The other 14 SNPs manifest this association through gene-gene interactions.

AB Lignin is the main component of stone cells, which are a key factor in determining pear quality. Therefore, modification of lignin biosynthesis has important implications for regulating stone cell formation. LIMs are involved in plant development, stress response and metabolism. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the pear LIM family and lignin-related LIMs. To address this problem, we identified 14 LIMs from the pear genome and named them. Phylogenomic and feature domain analysis showed that they were divided into CRP and DA&DAR-LIM groups and five subclades. LIMs from the genomes of four rosids (Prunus mummer, Prunus persica, Fragaria vesca and Vitis vinifera) were also identified, and microsynteny analysis revealed the most orthologous gene pairs in the cross of pear/grape and pear/mei. The transcript levels of PbLIMs were significantly affected by SA, ABA and MeJA. Spatio-temporal expression analysis showed that PbLIMs of the delta LIM2 subfamily were highly expressed in the flowers. Changes in the expression levels of PbWLIM1a and PbWLIM1b during fruit development was consistent with the changes in lignin content. Combining phylogenetic analyses, protein three-dimensional structure determination and sequence alignment analyses, these two genes were suggested as lignin related PbLIMs. Subcellular localization results showed that PbWLIM1a and PbWLIM1b were located mainly in the chloroplast. This study lays the foundation for revealing the mechanism of LIM-mediated lignin metabolism to regulate stone cell formation.

AB This study aimed to determine the microRNA (miRNA) profiles in granulosa cells (GCs) from the follicular fluid (FF) of patients with varying levels of ovarian reserve function. We included 45 women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. After collecting GCs from each patient, total RNA was extracted from 12 samples. Using Illumina/deep-sequencing technology, we analyzed the small RNAs in each group. Using the R package, we identified the differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs among patients with varying levels of ovarian reserve function. We identified 20 conserved and 3 novel miRNAs that were upregulated in the poor ovarian response (POR) group and 30 conserved miRNAs and 1 novel miRNA that were upregulated in the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) group. Bioinformatics analysis revealed complementary pairing between miR-23a and the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the Sirt1 mRNA. miR-23a can regulate SIRT1 protein expression at the posttranscriptional level in GCs. Overexpressing miR-23a can inhibit the expression of SIRT1, decrease the stimulatory effect of SIRT1 on the ERK1/2 pathway, inhibit the expression of p-ERK1/2, and increase apoptosis in GCs. Previous studies confirmed that miR-23a targets SIRT1 and promotes apoptosis in GCs by inhibiting the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This study provides a novel perspective regarding the role of miRNAs in the regulation of human GC apoptosis in vitro.

AB Background: Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by GALNS gene mutation. The aim of our study is to detect pathogenic variants for patients suspected of MPS IVA and set the base for subsequent prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis.
   Methods: In our study, 9 MPS IVA patients from south China families were investigated. Urine glycosaminoglycans (GAG(S)) screening was used as an initial method. For patients with abnormal result, all 14 exons and intron-exon junctions of the GALNS gene were sequenced after amplification from genomic DNA. The pathogenicity of novel mutations were analyzed with molecular genetics, bioinformatics and structure modeling in light of clinical manifestations and biochemical results.
   Results: Among 12 mutations detected, direct sequencing found 3 novel mutations (c.686A > C, p.Y229S; c.1498G > T, p.G500C; c.278T > C, p.I93T). The pathogenicity of these novel mutations was illustrated by correlating clinical symptoms with pedigree analysis and bioinformatics analysis.
   Conclusion.- The detection and variant analysis are essential for accurate diagnosis of MPS IVA patients. Our results enrich GALNS gene mutation spectrum of Chinese population. This information has important clinical value for molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling of patients with this disease.

AB Tin disulfide@graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite was successfully synthesized using a novel method at the first time. SnO2 quantum dots@GO (QDs@GO) prepared by traditional molten salt method was transformed into SnS2@GO nanocomposite in subsequent hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized SnS2@GO shows a regular hexagonal sheet-like nanostructure. Despite only a small amount of GO (2.4 wt%) is contained in the nanocomposite, it still exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate capability and cycling performances as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. This novel two-step method may provide an attractive alternative approach for the preparation of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) anode materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is difficult to produce bulk blanks directly from metallic glass, which limits its application. Ni-based metallic glass thin strips that can be manufactured easily were used to manufacture bulk metallic glass additively by ultrasonic bonding. The effects of ultrasonic vibration energy on the quality of the additive manufacturing of bulk Ni-based metallic glass were studied. The experimental results showed that a fully amorphous structure of bulk Ni-based metallic glass can be obtained with an appropriate ultrasonic vibration energy. The thermal properties were almost unchanged, and the hardness and elastic modulus of the Ni-based metallic glass were improved compared with the original material. Additive manufacturing of bulk metallic glass by ultrasonic bonding can broaden the application field of metallic glass.

AB Porous metallic glass (MG) structures are good candidates for structural and functional applications due to their light weight, enhanced ductility and specific surface area. Motivated by the improvement of mechanical properties of MGs, we perform molecular dynamics simulations on uniaxial tensile strain of monatomic Ta MG with nanoscale porous structures, focusing on the effects of pore stacking, size, as well as the strain rate on deformation behaviors. Obvious atomic level fracture from necking to shear sliding or accompanied with a network of multiple SBs are observed, and relating deformation transition from brittle to ductile is declared. It is found that: (i) AB pore stacking results in an improved ductility contrary to AA pore stacking with weakened ductility, and pore stacking inclining at 45 with respect to the loading direction may not necessarily deteriorate the ductility; (ii) Ultimate tensile stress decreases with the pore diameter, due to increasing porosity; and (iii) Better ductility is shown under higher strain rate for nanoporous MG structures due to the formation of the network of multiple SBs. This study is expected to shed light on the modulation of mechanical properties by designing the pore stacking and size in metallic glasses.

AB The evolution of porous structure and local density, and associated changes of potential energy in binary glasses under oscillatory shear deformation, are investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The porous glasses were initially prepared via a rapid thermal quench from the liquid state across the glass transition temperature and allowed to phase separate and solidify at constant volume, thus producing an extended porous network in an amorphous solid material. We find that under periodic shear, the potential energy decreases over consecutive cycles due to gradual rearrangement of the glassy material, and the minimum of the potential energy after thousands of shear cycles is lower at larger strain amplitudes. Moreover, with increasing cycle number, the pore size distributions become more skewed toward larger length scales, where a distinct peak is developed and the peak intensity is enhanced at larger strain amplitudes. The numerical analysis of the local density distribution functions demonstrates that cyclic loading leads to formation of higher density solid domains and homogenization of the regions with reduced density.

AB Novel Ag/AgCl-glass was successfully synthesized via a one-step ion-exchange process. Various analytical techniques were implemented to characterize the Ag/AgCl-glass. The results reveal that Ag/AgCl nanoparticles have a reduced volume-filling fraction along the diffusion depth of Ag+ ions in the glass matrix and exhibit nearly spherical structure with diameter about 5-20 nm. The as-fabricated Ag/AgCl-glass presents high visible transmittance and remarkably stable photocatalytic activity for photodegradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the synthesis mechanism and photocatalytic mechanism of the Ag/AgCl-glass have been proposed. The Ag/AgCl nanoparticles are formed and distributed upon the nearsurface layer depth of glass matrix during ion-exchanged process. Significantly stable photocatalytic activity can be mainly attributed to effective transfer and separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs in Ag/AgCl catalyst. Simultaneously, Cl will be reduced to Cl-and further combined with Ag to reform AgCl after photodegradation of organic pollutants. Novel Ag/AgCl-glass may lead to promising applications in buildings, air purification and antibacterial fields.

AB Fe-based metallic glasses (MGs) with good soft magnetic properties, high thermal stability combined with high corrosion resistance should have greatest potential for wide variety of applications. In this work, the effects of Nb, Ta and NbNi additions on the glass forming ability (GFA), thermal stability, magnetic properties and corrosion resistance of the as-spun Fe-Co-B-based amorphous ribbons have been investigated. The (Fe0.7Co0.3)(75)B21Nb4 and (Fe0.7Co0.3)(75)B21Ta4 MG possess the larger supercooled liquid region > 40 K, presenting a high GFA. Via appropriate adjustment of the Fe/Co content ratio (4:1), the glass transition temperature and onset crystallization temperature of the (Fe0.8Co0.2)(75)B21Nb4 MG reach up to 800 and 826 K, respectively, indicating the best thermal stability. All the amorphous ribbons show the soft magnetic properties identified by the coercivity < 1.3 Oe. Moreover, the (Fe0.8Co0.2)(75)B23Nb4 MG exhibits the good soft magnetic properties with a high saturation magnetization (M-s) up to 206 emu/g (1.92 T). Besides a positive role of Nb addition, the enhanced M-s can be attributed to the increased magnetic moment with substitution of Co by Fe, and the easy movement of magnetic domains induced by the decreased atomic packing density. In addition, the tested samples are all spontaneously passivated with a large passive region during electrochemical polarization measurement in the seawater solution. Especially, the (Fe0.7Co0.15Ni0.15)(75)B21Nb4 MG presents the optimal corrosion resistance with the most positive corrosion potential.

AB Nd3+-doped TeO2-MoO3-ZnO (TMZ) tellurite glass with excellent glass-forming ability and optical property is explored for laser material applications. The glass-forming region is predicted via the "thermodynamic method" and then confirmed by some few sets of experiment. The fundamental characteristics of the TMZ glass such as glass structure, optical and spectroscopic properties are also investigated in detail by Raman, absorption, emission spectra and fluorescence decay curves. Interestingly, the vitrification, thermal and optical property of the present glass is significantly improved with the addition of MoO3. Furthermore, the TMZ glass has a higher emission cross section (3.12 x 10(-20) cm(2)) and spectroscopic figure of merit (6.01 x 10(-24) s.cm(2)) for the Nd3+: E-4(3/2)-> I-4(11/2) transition. All results indicate the potential applications of the TMZ glass in laser materials.

AB This work reports the feasibility of extra rejuvenation in a ZrCuAlNi bulk metallic glass (BMG) under combination of cryothermal treatment and tensile elastostatic loading in low stresses. Pair distribution function analysis shows that the annihilation of Cu-centered clusters as well as the increase in population of Al-centered clusters and intensification of spatial connectivity are signs of rejuvenation evolution under cryothermal treatment. On the other side, tensile elastostatic loading leads to an extensive disordering through the both short range and medium range scales. The maximum stored energy values with cryothermal treatment and elastostatic loading in the BMG were 0.52 and 0.73 Kj/mol, respectively. The combination of two mentioned processes on a BMG sample also indicates that the material can inherit the characteristics of structural changes which are caused by both cryothermal treatment and tensile loading altogether. This event generates an extra stored energy in the metallic glass (0.92 Kj/mol).

AB Microstructural features, thermal stability and crystallization kinetics of various melt spun Al-based alloys containing transition metals (TM = Ni, Cu) and Ce-based rare earth metals (MM: Misch Metal) were investigated via X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It is shown that the extended topological instability of Egami-Waseda model (lambda criterion) is a useful tool to predict the crystallization behavior of the prepared alloys. FCC-Al nanoparticles are formed during the initial crystallization process. Calculation of the apparent activation energy using the Kissinger method indicates that partial replacement of nickel by copper decreases the thermal stability. The thermal stability in the presence of copper, however, can be improved by increasing the MM content. On the other hand, TEM studies determine that copper reduces the average size of FCC-Al nanocrystals from similar to 50 nm in Al86Ni10MM4 to similar to 35 nm in Al86Ni9Cu1MM4 amorphous alloy. Thermodynamic evaluation of the crystallization process and determination of the local crystallization index reveal that the primary crystallization in amorphous Al-based alloys containing MM, Ni and Cu is a complex diffusion controlled process.

AB Ion conducting tellurite glass of the composition 0.60AgI-0.40(0.45Ag(2)O-0.55TeO(2)) has been prepared by melt quenching technique. Controlled heat treatment has been applied on the as-prepared sample for 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h duration, respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that the base sample is amorphous and heat-treated samples exhibit the presence of nanocrystallites. The size of the crystallites increases with the increase of the duration of heat treatment. The Ag+ ion dynamics has been investigated over wide temperature and frequency ranges, and the frequency dependent conductivity data have been analyzed in the context of Almond-West formalism. The temperature dependence of the dc conductivity and the crossover frequency shows a different kind of behaviour in contradiction to that observed in other ion conducting glasses. The samples do not follow the Barton-Nakajima-Namikawa relation. With increasing heating hour, the ionic conductivity of the heat treated samples falls in consequence of the formation of agglomerated grains. Deviation from the time-temperature superposition principle for the conductivity spectra has been observed for these samples.

AB The influences of boron on silicate glass dissolution behavior and crystallization have long been important in the nuclear waste glass and technical glass communities. Boron is a challenging component to model due to this ability to assume three- and four-fold coordinations with oxygen, as well as its ability to form complex structural units with silicate tetrahedra. Furthermore, the low atomic mass limits the available characterization techniques. In the present work, recent literature findings on the compositional influence on boron speciation are implemented to interpret new data on alkali boroaluminosilicate glasses studied with B-11 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), synchrotron X-ray scattering (s-XRS), and chemical durability measurements. The purpose of this study is to understand the influence of boron on the crystallization behavior of sodium and lithium aluminosilicate systems, NaAl1-xBxSiO4 and LiAl1-xBxSiO4, as applied to problems in nuclear waste vitrification. Comparisons are drawn between the alkali coordination number and crystallization behavior as a function of boron addition, as obtained through modeling of synchrotron X-ray total scattering using Empirical Potential Structural Refinement.

AB A remarkable characteristic of borate glasses is the ability of forming magnetic nanoparticles at low doping with transition element oxides. We have studied structure and magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles formed in borate glasses, in particular, concentration and temperature dependences of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and electron magnetic resonance (EMR) spectra. A series of glasses of molar composition 22.5K(2)O-22.5Al(2)O(3) -55B(2)O(3) doped with 1.5 mass % of Fe2O3 and different contents of Gd2O3 from 0.1 to 1.0 mass % was prepared using a conventional melt quenching technique and subjected to an additional thermal treatment. The whole set of results allows to identify the predominant magnetic phase in these glasses as epsilon-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, with a considerable part of iron ions substituted by gadolinium. Analysis and computer simulations of the EMR spectra allow separating the contribution of electron paramagnetic resonance of diluted iron ions and together with the temperature dependences of magnetization demonstrate a superparamagnetic character of the nano particle magnetism.

The absence of peaks in the XRD traces related to glass former (Sb2O3) after discharging is directly confirmed that the antimony content retains its amorphous phase even after the samples are being discharged. Several nanosized amorphous intermediate domains are precipitated in the bright region of Sn-Ge-Sb glass network as appeared in TEM results. Except for the sample B-6, all the other samples exhibited two sloping sodiation and de-sodiation plateaus which are almost constant at around 0.62 V and 0.14 V due to the formation of amorphous intermediates domains such as NagSn(4) and NaSn3 in the glass network. The initial discharge capacity achieved to be highest for B6 sample (838 mA h g(-1)) and loss of discharge capacity is up to similar to 31.18% even at high rate 5C. A systematic study can monitor the stable cycle performance and shed light on the design of target glass anode with high capacity and stability.

AB Numerical simulation was conducted to investigate the toughening mechanisms of bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) originated from the martensite transformation of toughening phase (TP). Firstly, a free volume model was chosen to describe the deformation of BMG matrix by addressing the initiation and propagation of shear bands (SBs) in BMG matrix; while a macroscopic phenomenological constitutive model was employed to describe the martensite transformation of TP and its correspondent deformation. Then the two models were implemented into ABAQUS as user material subroutines (UMATs). Finally, the numerically simulated stress strain curves of BMGCs were compared with the experimental ones to verify the effectiveness of finite element model, and then some numerical analyses were performed to discuss the toughening mechanism of BMGCs caused by the martensite transformation of TP. It is found that the strain hardening and SBs' evolution in BMGCs were significantly influenced by the transformation strain, start stress and hardening modulus of martensite transformation. The excellent toughness of BMGCs mainly results from the phase transition from austenite to martensite phase in TPs.

AB Transition metal ions are essential micronutrients for all living organisms and play an important role in bone metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the impact of transition metal ions (Cu, Co, Mn, Fe) on the structure and bioactivity of bioactive glasses. The emphasis was laid on understanding their influence on the chemical dissolution behavior of glasses and its impact on their vitro bioactivity, osteoblast proliferation and oxidative stress levels. The structure of glasses was studied by using molecular EXAFS in combination with Raman spectroscopy. The apatite-forming ability of glasses has been investigated by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy after immersion of glass powders in simulated body fluid (SBF) for time durations varying between 1 and 7 days. A significant effect on the bioactivity was observed with addition of transition metal ions. The cellular responses were observed in vitro on glass powders using human osteosarcoma MG63 cell line. The dose dependent cytoprotective effect of glasses with respect to the concentration of transition metal ions (Cu, Co, Mn, Fe) released from the glasses is also discussed.

AB Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells regarded as promising devices for energy conversion systems. This study aims to introduce an exact modeling scheme for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell, which can imitate and model the electrical, electrochemical features of an actual Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell stack. Most of the developed schemes are experimental, multi-variable, and comprise various non-linear terms which must be assessed precisely to assure a decent estimation. In this study, a novel optimization model is employed to determine the Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell parameters accurately. The Shark Smell Optimizer simulates the hunting process for a Shark. Hence, Shark Smell Optimizer is a nature-inspired and metaheuristic optimization algorithm depends on the rules of metaheuristic proficiency, exploration and exploitation terms to evade errors in local optimums and to obtain appropriate responses. The introduced Shark Smell Optimizing method is examined on five commercial proton exchange membrane fuel cells stack concerning empirical data. Many types of research and operation examination are executed to verify the effectuality of the proposed scheme. Additionally, for more authentication, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells modeling with Shark Smell Optimizer obtained data is compared with other optimization algorithm results. A statistical analysis also carried out for proposed method, the obtained show the reliability of Shark Smell Optimizer in comparison to other utilized techniques.

AB A method for thermal management of Li-ion battery pack with the application of various flexible form-stable composite phase change materials (CPCMs) is proposed, and investigated both numerically and experimentally. Flexible CPCMs embedded in battery pack lower the thermal contact resistance, thereby improving the thermal control performance. Experimental results show that with the application of flexible CPCMs, the battery temperature drops by 18 degrees C at 10 C discharge rate. In addition, flexible CPCM has better thermal control performance than the case of conventional CPCMs. This allows Li-ion battery pack to safely work for an extended period of time without exceeding upper temperature limits. The thermal control performance is observed to vary considerably with three factors: the phase change temperature of flexible CPCMs, working condition, and the ambient temperature. One flexible CPCM with phase change temperature of 33 degrees C is found to be optimal for small power levels and low ambient temperatures. Another flexible CPCM with 47 degrees C of phase change temperature is suitable for high power levels, short-term high heat fluxes, and high ambient temperatures. The numerical results are in reasonable accordance with experimental ones.

AB Interest in solar chimney power plant (SCPP) has seen resurgence due to the continuously increasing awareness on environmental concerns, particularly greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, since the 21st century. Although remarkable advances in the understanding of SCPP have been achieved through extensive theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies with different focuses on various aspects of the SCPP technology, no industrial scale SCPP has been built. In response to these new scientific advances and challenges for commercialization, seven questions, including parameter influences, turbine design, flow and heat transfer characteristics, similarity analysis, and hybrid systems, are presented in this work. In addition, answers and current understanding are included to provide succinct links to latest knowledge and identify areas that require further research.

AB The energy conversion and storage efficiency was commonly ignored in experimental studies on nanoscale flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs). In this study, we develop a generalized theoretical method to optimize the energy conversion and storage efficiencies of nanoscale flexible PEHs. The results are validated by comparisons with experimental measurements for various ambient excitations. A simple scaling law is established to reveal the intrinsic correlation between the efficiency of energy conversion/storage and various system parameters of the PEHs. For either the energy conversion or storage circuit, the output power density may be maximized by properly designing an intrinsic normalized parameter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an independent optimization criterion is indispensable for standard storage circuits since including a storage module into the conversion circuit redefines the electromechanical behavior of the PEH system. The results may be used as guidelines for optimizing the energy conversion and storage efficiencies of nanoscale flexible PEHs that have promising applications in harvesting biomechanical energies.

AB Mistreatment of small hydropower sources requires the use of small turbines that combine efficiency and economy which can suitably provide the power requirements of rural and small societies. In this context, the cross flow hydro turbines are extensively used due to their simpler in design, ease of maintenance, low initial cost. Although the cross flow hydro turbine has moderated efficiency, but it has operated at low head and discharge. Hence, the objective of the present investigation is to increase the efficiency of a cross flow hydro turbine with the geometric modification. In the present study, the numerical investigation of cross flow hydro turbine has been carried out using multi-physics finite volume solver in ANSYS FLUENT. The three dimensional unsteady simulations have been conducted using shear stress transport k-omega turbulence model. The performance of cross flow hydro turbine has been investigated by changing the inlet blade angle from 5 degrees to 40 degrees and nozzle entry arc angle from 65 degrees to 85 degrees with the number of blades being 20. The rotational speed of the turbine has been varied from 200 rpm to 800 rpm. The total pressure and velocity field have been examined to evaluate the performance coefficients. From the unsteady results, the maximum efficiency has been found at the inlet blade angle, 5 degrees and nozzle entry arc angle, 65 degrees with the runner rotational speed of 600 rpm. However, with the consideration of the manufacturing feasibility inlet blade angle and nozzle entry arc angle have been considered as 10 degrees and 65 degrees respectively to be the most promising design configuration. The effect of temperature of the flowing water on performance of the turbine also has been studied. The maximum efficiency at inlet blade angle, 10 degrees has been found to be 93.8% at 600 rpm. By incorporating the nozzle entry arc angle, maximum efficiency has been found to be 97.8% at nozzle entry arc angle, 65 degrees with rotational speed 600 rpm and inlet blade angle, 10 degrees. The efficiency of the current design configuration has been found 20% higher compare to the existing model.

AB The aim of this study is to deeply search and understand the performance of the coupling system composed of an alkali metal thermoelectric converter and a thermoelectric generator. The main methods are to update the model of the coupling system, which includes the main irreversible losses existing in subsystems and coupling system, and obtain the analytical expressions of the power outputs and efficiencies of two subsystems and coupling system. The main novelties are to discuss the influences of the thickness of the beta"-alumina solid electrolyte on the whole performance of the system and solve the matching problem between two subsystems. The main contents of this study include that the influences of the thickness of the electrolyte membrane, current density of the alkali metal thermoelectric converter, and electric current of the thermoelectric generator on the power output density and efficiency are discussed and the maximum power output density and efficiency of the system are calculated and compared with those of the single alkali metal thermoelectric converter and the existing coupling models. The results obtained reveal the advantages of the present model. The whole performance of the coupling system can be optimized and the parametric selection criteria of several key parameters of the coupling system operating at optimum states can be provided, When the thickness of the electrolyte membrane is optimally selected, the maximum efficiency of the present model attain 34.6% and increase about 10.4%, compared with those of the existing best coupling system. The waste heat released by the alkali metal thermoelectric converter can be efficiently utilized by the thermoelectric generator.

AB The load matching performance between the load output of combined cooling, heating and power systems (CCHP) and user requirement is a key indicator to assess the systems; it is inherently influenced by the fluctuation load demand of users and its method of operation. In this research, five dimensionless load matching parameters are extracted to express the load matching relations. Further, a matching map is established based on the load matching parameters, which is demarcated as two zones according to the load demand of users. Meanwhile, the energy saving rate (ESR), CO2 emission reduction (CO2ER) and operation cost reduction (CostR) of the CCHP systems over the reference separate system are analyzed for the following the electric load (FEL) and following the thermal load (FTL) strategies. Additionally, an improved hybrid load-following method (FHL) is proposed based on the comparison between the FEL and FTL strategies. Finally, the boundaries of the suitable users are also summarized when ESR > 15% for different operation strategies and seasons.

AB International shipping provides 80-90% of global trade, but strict environmental regulations around NOx, SOx and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are set to cause major technological shifts. The pathway to achieving the international target of 50% GHG reduction by 2050 is unclear, but numerous promising options exist. This study provides a holistic assessment of these options and their combined potential to decarbonise international shipping, from a technology, environmental and policy perspective. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is reaching mainstream and provides 20-30% CO2 reductions whilst minimising SOx and other emissions. Costs are favourable, but GHG benefits are reduced by methane slip, which varies across engine types. Biofuels, hydrogen, nuclear and carbon capture and storage (CCS) could all decarbonise much further, but each faces significant barriers around their economics, resource potentials and public acceptability. Regarding efficiency measures, considerable fuel and GHG savings could be attained by slow-steaming, ship design changes and utilising renewable resources. There is clearly no single route and a multifaceted response is required for deep decarbonisation. The scale of this challenge is explored by estimating the combined decarbonisation potential of multiple options. Achieving 50% decarbonisation with LNG or electric propulsion would likely require 4 or more complementary efficiency measures to be applied simultaneously. Broadly, larger GHG reductions require stronger policy and may differentiate between short- and long-term approaches. With LNG being economically feasible and offering moderate environmental benefits, this may have short-term promise with minor policy intervention. Longer term, deeper decarbonisation will require strong financial incentives. Lowest-cost policy options should be fuel- or technology-agnostic, internationally applied and will require action now to ensure targets are met by 2050.

AB The paper presents a numerical analysis of combustion, carried out on a compression ignition indirect injection engine fueled by both Diesel and syngas, the latter obtained from biomass gasification and introduced in the intake manifold. The computational fluid dynamics model includes an improved chemical kinetics scheme, tailored on the syngas-diesel dual fuel combustion. The model was validated by an experimental campaign, on the same engine. The syngas fuel was produced by a small scale gasifier running on wood chips. Several simulations were performed varying both the share of syngas and the Diesel start of injection angle. The total amount of heat released by combustion can increase up to 50%, along with the indicated work and the cylinder peak pressure. The start of injection angle should be modified in order to preserve the mechanical integrity of the engine, as well as to maximize its brake efficiency. The numerical analysis provides the guidelines for setting the injection strategy, as a function of the syngas share.

AB Earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHE) is a promising energy-efficient technology for indoor thermal environment regulation; however, it should adapt to both building and climatic conditions. This paper proposes a new inverse approach to determine the parameters of EAHE integrating into buildings and to achieve a prescribed indoor thermal comfort objective. First, the criterion for achieving year-round thermally comfortable indoor air temperatures is formulated. According to the objective, the required combined parameters characterizing the dynamic behavior of the earth-to-air heat exchanger outlet-air temperature are inversely calculated. Then, the earth-to-air heat exchanger parameters, such as length, radius, burial depth and flow rate, satisfying the proposed objective are determined. The results demonstrate that decreasing the phase shift of the anticipated indoor air temperature profile helps to reduce the requirements on earth-to-air heat exchanger parameters. A Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation incorporated with real meteorological date is implemented according to the EAHE parameters obtained from the proposed approach. It is demonstrated the proposed inverse approach is effective and the year-round indoor thermal comfort is achievable.

AB For establishing the large-scale hydrogen production as energy carrier from water electrolysis, improving cost-effectiveness and efficiency remains the main challenges. In this study, we propose a novel proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cell (PEMEC), consisting of non-conductive bipolar plates (BPs) and thin film liquid/gas diffusion layers (TF-LGDLs) to reduce the cost and improve the PEMEC performance. The 3D printed non-conductive BP is manufactured with low-cost polylactic acid (PLA) and is mainly functioned to distribute the water and gas products. A titanium thin film LGDL (TF-LGDL) with surroundings is developed for directly transporting electrons from the external power sources, which changes the electron transport path in the PEMECs. The PLA BP exhibits an extremely low cost (1/10 of that of the graphite BP), and the hydrogen production rate per unit BP cost in a PEMEC with PLA BP, is almost 6 times higher than a conventional one with graphite BPs. More importantly, the PEMECs with PLA BPs can achieve a good electrochemical performance of 2.21 V at 1 A/cm(2)under room temperature. A model is also developed to investigate the impact of the BP resistivity of on the cell performance, and a guideline for the selection guideline of conductivity of BPs material is provided. The easily accessible and low-cost PLA BPs coupled with the new electron-conducting path will drive the exploration of plastic materials for economic and efficient water splitting or other energy conversion devices, including fuel cells, batteries, and solar cells.

AB A novel gas-pressurized (GP) torrefaction method to produce torrefied biomass with high fuel quality was recently proposed in our previous work. The pyrolysis behavior and kinetics of the GP torrefied biomasses were studied in detail using DAEM, FWO and Friedman methods, and the reaction mechanism was also investigated in this work. The results showed that the Friedman method was most suitable for the pyrolysis kinetic of the torrefied biomass, compared to the DAEM and FWO methods. The pyrolysis activation energy of the GP torrefied biomass at volatilization stage was lower than those of the raw biomass and torrefied biomass produced via traditional torrefaction. Contrastingly, it increased significantly at char decomposition stage. The mechanism investigation showed that the reasons for the low activation energy at volatilization stage were the catalytic effect of the minerals, such as K and Na, and the porous structure of the GP torrefied biomass. On the other hand, the significant increase of the activation energy at char decomposition stage was mainly attributed to two factors. The first factor is that some minerals, such as SiO2, suppressed the decomposition of the char. The minerals having catalytic effect, such as K and Na, had already volatilized at high temperatures. Another contributing factor is the high aromaticity of the GP torrefied biomass. This research provides a deep understanding of the pyrolysis kinetics and mechanism of GP torrefied biomass.

AB The integration energy and information technology has prompted the development of the multi-carrier energy system. Energy hub model is widely used in the multi-carrier energy system study. However, it is the difficult to formulate coupling matrix and optimize operation state of complex energy hub model. This paper proposes an efficient standardized multi-step modelling method and linearized optimization method for the energy hub model. Firstly, a complex energy hub model is separated into several simple energy hub models based on nodes arrangement and virtual nodes insertion methods; then the coupling matrix of each simple energy hub model can be easily modelled; the coupling matrix of the complex energy hub model can be obtained by multiplying the coupling matrix of each simple energy hub model. In addition, energy storage, demand response and renewable energy are considered and integrated in the energy hub model. Further, the nonlinear optimal operation model of energy hub is reformulated to a linear programming problem by using variable substitution in each simple energy hub model. Cases study is performed on a resident district in a city of China on a typical summer day with the energy storage devices, demand response and renewable energy considered. Compared with the traditional calculation method, the computational burden is significantly reduced based on the proposed calculation method, which can guarantee the global optimal operation decision.

AB This study aims to investigate the thermal behaviours of a specific biomass and a polymer sample through co-pyrolytic degradation. Therefore, a non-edible food processing waste (cherry seed: CS) and a typical plastic waste (polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) were selected and their interaction was studied using a combined TGA/MS/FT-IR system. By the help of TGA data, the non-isothermal kinetic analysis was performed using four different kinetic methods [Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), Vyazovkin and distributed activation energy (DAEM)]. The kinetic results showed that the activation energy values were in agreement over the conversion degree values between 0.1 and 0.9. For determination of the synergistic or inhibitive interactions, theoretical and experimental thermogravimetry values were also compared. Moreover, in situ determination of the main pyrolytic and co-pyrolytic degradation compounds such as methyl, water, methoxy, hydrogen chloride, carbon dioxide and benzene with respect to temperature and time was studied for the first time. By this way, primary and secondary reactions related to methylation, dehydration, aromatization, fragmentation, dehydrochlorination were interpreted. Consequently, PVC was found to change pyrolytic degradation behaviour of lignocellulosic biomass by changing reactivity, activation energy and reaction mechanisms.

AB The Angle of Attack (AOA) of the Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) blades has a dominant role in the generation of the aerodynamic forces and the power generation of the turbine. However, there is a significant uncertainty in determining the blade AOAs during operation due to the very complex flow structures and this limits the turbine design optimization. The paper proposes a fast and accurate method for the calculation of the constantly changing AOA based on the velocity flow field data at two reference points upstream the turbine blades. The new method could be used to calculate and store the AOA data during the CFD simulations without the need for extensive post-processing for efficient turbine aerodynamic analysis and optimisation. Several single reference-points and pair of reference-points criteria are used to select the most appropriate locations of the two reference points to calculate the AOA and It is found that using the flow data from the two reference points at the locations 0.5 aerofoil chord length upstream and 1 chord away from each side of the aerofoil can give most accurate estimation across a range of tested AOAs. Based on the proposed AOA estimation method, the performance of a fixed pitch and the sinusoidal variable pitch VAWT configurations are analysed and compared with each other. The analysis illustrates how the sinusoidal variable pitch configuration could enhance the overall performance of the turbine by maintaining more favourable AOAs, and lift and drag distributions.

AB The integration of latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) units with heating systems in buildings is regarded as a promising technology for heating load management; however, so far a limited number of experimental studies have been reported that focus on space heating applications on a representative scale. In this study, we develop and test a 0.38 m(3) LHTES unit containing cylindrically macro-encapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) with a melting temperature range of 44-53 degrees C and with gross mass of 154 kg. The unit has been tested with two tank orientations, horizontal and vertical. In the horizontal orientation tests, parametric studies show that increasing the difference between heat transfer fluid (HTF) supply temperatures and phase-change temperatures of PCMs, as well as increasing HTF flowrates, can both reduce the complete melting/solidification and complete charging/discharging time. Non-linear charging/discharging rates in PCMs are observed. The vertical orientation enables the forming of either a stratified or mixed flow regime in the tank. For charging, the stratified flow provides higher charging rates in PCMs compared to the mixed flow. When discharging the unit with a stratified HTF flow at 35 degrees C, lower HTF flowrates prolong the discharging time during which the released heat sustains an outlet temperature above 45 degrees C. Finally, comparisons between horizontal and vertical orientation tests reveal that although the vertical orientation can shorten the charging/discharging time by up to 20% for the entire unit to reach an energy density of 30 kWh/m(3), it leads to decrease in PCM thermal capacity by at most 8.2%. The speculated cause of this loss is phase segregation suggested by observed fluid motions in PCM cylinders. This study comprehensively characterizes an LHTES unit providing insights to optimizing its operating strategies considering its coupling with space heating systems.

AB The proliferation of renewable energy particularly the combination of solar-wind power and storage bank, is likely to be occupied throughout the world, to mitigate the local energy concerns, improve the energy supply opportunities for off-grid communities and vitiate environmental pollution concerns as well as ease the intensity of energy consumption. To mitigate the disharmony between renewable energy (RE) generation and supply, a cost-optimal autonomous hybrid renewable energy system is developed and comparatively analyzed, considering the saturation level of each involved RE source based on various technical and economic key indicators. This study proposes a mathematical model to comprehensively analyze the effect of varying saturation, i.e. increasing the saturation of one resource meanwhile decreasing the ratio of other resource, on battery bank size, state of charge (SOC), loss of power supply, excess energy, net present cost, levelized cost of energy (COE) and payback time. A saturation factor is introduced, from 0 to 1 value with step size 0.02, where zero represents the wind-only system and one represents the solar-only system. Three different systems are considered, with different wind turbine sizes (total 150 configurations), to comparatively analyze the different energy systems and the result reveals that smaller wind turbine size (2 kW) with 90% saturation of wind energy is the most cost-effective system for the proposed remote island. In addition, the solar-alone and wind-alone systems are compared, showing that the wind-only system can provide good performance as compare to solar-only. Furthermore, the effects of the saturation factor on COE, battery bank size, SOC, excess energy, system reliability and different load demands are analyzed. Energy balance analysis of whole year and simulation performance of the system is accomplished to verify the system reliability. Sensitivity analysis reveals that wind energy, battery cost and load has a significant impact on COE than other factors.

AB The performance of wave energy converters is significantly affected by buoys. This research studied the force and conversion efficiency of buoys in low wave energy density seas and involved the selection of a cylindrical buoy and a hemispherical buoy, which were applied in a sealed-buoy wave energy converter (SBWEC). The underwater equivalent area was utilized as the variable to investigate the force, pitch response amplitude operator (RAO), and conversion efficiency of the buoys in irregular waves. The results show that the common responses occurred both in the cylindrical and hemispherical buoys. The force of the buoys in a resonance state was distributed in a concentric ring shape and gradually decreased from the inner to the outer areas. The force, pitch RAOs, and conversion efficiency increased with a corresponding increase in the underwater equivalent area. Results determined that owing to the difference in the underwater equivalent area and shape, the force of the cylindrical buoy with a diameter 2 m and 4 m was 194-1455% larger than that of the hemispherical buoy with the same diameter. The pitch RAOs of the cylindrical buoy were 0.6-52.59% larger than that of the hemispherical buoy because of the difference in force. In turn, the average conversion efficiency of the cylindrical buoy was 1.31% greater than that of the hemispherical buoy. The novel SBWEC made the wave energy conversion efficiency of the buoys in low wave energy density seas 0.6-1.4% less than that in high wave energy density seas. The utilization of the underwater equivalent area provides a new method for researching the force and conversion efficiency of buoys.

AB The installation of a biorefinery in the centre of Andalusia, a region located in the south of Spain, has been evaluated in this research study. The biorefinery was designed and dimensioned according to the availability of lignocellulosic biomass waste in this area to ensure a permanent operation. Specifically, different mixtures of forestry, olive and grape pruning, sunflower waste and sawdust has been proposed for their valorization to obtain chemicals such as ethanol, dimethylether (DME), synthesis gas and, eventually, electricity, which entail the social, environmental and economical improvement of this area. The process consisted of an alkaline pretreatment unit, Kraft pulping process, which separates the incoming lignocellulosic waste to a cellulose-rich pulp and the black liquors containing dissolved lignin. The pulp could be treated through acid hydrolysis, evaporation, adsorption, fermentation and distillation processes, mainly, to obtain ethanol, while the liquor was gasified and converted to DME. The operating conditions for the different process stages were optimized to reduce, as far as possible, the generated by-products. The total ethanol production was 42,700 T y(-1), which represents 16.5% of Spanish production. On the other hand, the indirect and direct DME syntheses were evaluated under isothermal and adiabatic conditions. The highest DME production was obtained by using direct DME synthesis developed in an isothermal reactor. A total DME production of 137,850 T y(-1) with a purity of 99.99% was obtained. The implementation of this proposal seems to be technological and economically feasible.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effects of temperature, ethyl acetate to palm oil molar ratio, residence time, and packing alumina balls on triglyceride conversion, ethyl ester, and acetin contents. The complete triglyceride conversion was observed at 1.35 +/- 0.05 times of the transition temperature. The packed alumina enhanced the ester content up to 20%; but it had no effect on the acetin content. Furthermore, this study also intended to determine the effects of the acetin content and thermal cracking on 19 fuel properties of lipid-based biofuel samples synthesized by supercritical ethyl acetate. The optimal condition was found at 380 degrees C, 20 MPa and ethyl acetate to oil molar ratio of 30:1. First, the density and kinematic viscosity of the biofuels were slightly higher than the maximum values specified by standards because of the presence of triacetin and polymerized products. Second, packing alumina balls increase the mixing intensity and thermal conductivity inside the tubular reactor resulted in higher contents of sulfated ash and carbon residue. Third, the acid values of the biofuel samples were considerably higher than the standard value of biodiesel. However, copper strip corrosion testing resulted in slight tarnishing (level 1A). The corrosiveness of fuels mainly originates from their sulfur compound content, neither biofuel sample was classified as a corrosive material. Furthermore, the high acid values of the samples interfered with the testing of oxidation stability. Finally, beneficial effects of triacetin on cold flow properties were revealed in this study. The cloud point and cold filter plugging point of lipid-based biofuels strongly depended on the thermal stress of the reaction conditions rather than the triacetin concentration.

AB Distributed power generation systems powered by compressed air energy storage can be considered as one of the effective solutions for high energy demand. In this regard, the key component for such systems is the expander where the overall system efficiency has been affected by the expander performance. Therefore, this work outlines a novel integrated methodology to predict the performance characteristics of the radial-inflow expander for small scale compressed air energy storage CAES system for low mass flow rate applications. The integrated methodology combines the mean-line design and 3D CFD simulations for the expander with thermodynamics analysis for CAES system. The expander mean-line design is verified against the data available in open literature and compared with the delivered results from the CFD simulations using ANSYS-CFX. Moreover, comprehensive parametric studies are carried out based on the CFD analyses under design and off-design conditions in terms of rotational speed, expander inlet temperature and expansion ratio in order to investigate the effect of those conditions beside the geometric parameters on the expander and system performance. The delivered results from CFD simulations and CAES system analyses highlighted that radial-inflow expander with CAES can be used for distributed power generation. The expander performance maps based on CFD analyses exhibited that the maximum power and efficiency were 3.282 kW and 76.70% respectively with CASE system efficiency of 12.46% and the system round trip efficiency of 59.08%.

AB This study aims to develop novel high energy-efficient and economically viable methanol production processes form coke oven gas. To pursue this goal, two process schemes for the coke oven gas utilization, namely a highly integrated polygeneration of methanol, power, and heat, are proposed. The optimal system configuration and operating conditions for maximizing methanol amount or the total energy production were identified through the development of rigorous process models. The capability of the proposed processes was analyzed with different criteria: energy efficiency, carbon balance and minimum selling price of the produced methanol. As a result, the energy efficiency of the proposed processes is analyzed to range from 53 to 71%, which are greatly improved compared to the base process (38%). An economic evaluation study revealed that the minimum selling price of the methanol of the proposed processes was 0.23-0.29 USD/kg, which are competitive with conventional methanol production processes.

AB The synthesis of MgO/MgAl2O4 was conducted using hybrid microwave-impregnation with different glycine fuel ratios (1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5). To this end, the combustion synthesis (CS) and microwave heating were applied for the synthesis of MgAl2O4, and impregnation was used for the dispersion of MgO active phase on the given samples. The characterization of samples was done using TGA, XRD, BET, BJH, FTIR, FESEM, and EDX to reach the optimal glycine fuel ratio for CS. The best physiochemical properties were observed in 1.5 ratio. The pore size, the surface area, and the mean pore diameter of the mentioned nanocatalyst were respectively 0.358 cm(3)/g, 93.8 m(2)/g, and 5 nm. Finally, transesterification reaction was employed for the preparation of biodiesel to measure the nanocatalysts activity. The findings showed that the nanocatalyst produced by hybrid microwave impregnation method with fuel ration of 1.5 (at the presence of glycine) is highly desirable for biodiesel production. Using optimal sample, transesterification reaction conversion reached 92.7%. Reusability investigation of the optimal catalyst showed that this sample possessed a relatively good reusability for biodiesel production. Regarding the simple and fast synthesis method (hybrid microwave impregnation), it can be said that the catalyst synthesized by this method is suitable for industrial biodiesel preparation.

AB Electric vehicles with green power system are viable alternatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil energy resources. The power source such as Li-ion battery has high sensitivity to temperature, which is a challenge related to battery thermal management. Battery thermal management system plays a vital role in the high efficiency, dependability and security of these batteries. Modern commercial electric vehicles normally use liquid based battery thermal management system, which has high heat transfer efficiency with the function of cooling or heating. This paper firstly looks at the effects of temperature on the battery performance from three aspects: low temperature, high temperature and differential temperature. Then the battery management system is discussed with the main emphasis on battery modeling methods and thermal management strategies. Further, a systematic review of liquid based system is presented in terms of direct and indirect contact mode. Progress made in liquid channel configuration and heat transfer fluid aiming at improving the overall thermal performance is also discussed. With the function of liquid-gas phase change process, the heat pipe based battery thermal management is feasible and effective for its high heat transfer efficiency. To further facilitate vehicle-mounted energy optimization, an integrated vehicle thermal management system with appropriate energy allocation is required. In addition, the battery thermal management system connected with the other subsystems (e.g., heating ventilation air conditioning system) by utilizing the liquid circulation in vehicle thermal management has great potential in energy-saving and efficiency promotion.

AB The short service life of fuel cell is a key problem that restricts the commercialization of fuel cell vehicles. Many scholars have found that gas starvation is one of the most important causes of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell lifetime decay, which leads to a series of severe consequences such as carbon support corrosion, cell reversal and output performance degradation. However, accurate diagnosis and effective mitigation of fuel cell gas starvation are not achieved currently. Gas starvation is a condition that the reaction gas of proton exchange membrane fuel cell working in the sub-stoichiometric state. In this paper, we will study the causes, severe consequences, diagnostic methods and mitigation measures of the gas starvation in proton exchange membrane fuel cells through previous literature review. This research is aim to provide guidance to the diagnose methods, to optimize the system control strategy and structure design and to contribute to the studies which are focus on prolong the proton exchange membrane fuel cell lifetime.

AB Adsorption Heat Transformation (AHT) is one of the most promising solutions for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and effective environmental protection. The working pair "adsorbent - adsorbate" is a key factor affecting the performance of AHT cycle. This paper addresses the investigation of the adsorption of methanol vapor on MIL-101(Cr), which belongs to a family of porous crystalline solids, Metal - Organic Frameworks. MIL-101(Cr) is shaped with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a binder to form grains. The equilibrium of methanol adsorption on the grains of MIL-101(Cr) is studied and the potential of the MIL-101(Cr) methanol working pair is estimated for various AHT cycles. The dynamics of methanol adsorption is explored under conditions of a new cycle for upgrading temperature of ambient heat. The main findings of this study are: (i) the addition of PVA does not affect methanol adsorption equilibrium; (ii) the amount of methanol exchanged under typical conditions of the cooling and ambient heat amplification cycles varies from 0.27 to 0.31 g/g; (iii) under conditions of the heat amplification cycle the methanol adsorption on the loose grains of 0.8-1.8 mm size, occurs under the "grain size insensitive mode" when the dynamics of adsorption in the adsorbent beds with the same thickness does not depend on the size of MIL grains. For the desorption runs, the poor mass transfer decelerates the process for the grains of 1.6-1.8 mm size; (iv) the specific useful heat and heating power for heat amplification cycle equal 385 kJ/kg and 0.65-1.95 kW/kg, respectively. The high values of specific heat and heating power illustrate an encouraging potential of the "MIL-101(Cr) methanol" pair for the ambient heat amplification cycle.

AB Biodiesel has gained the forefront of our focus on renewable transportation fuels. This article provides a comprehensive review on the sources used as feedstock and their classification based on generation or type (edible, non-edible, waste resources and animal fats) along with a variety of classical and modern oil extraction techniques. The technical aspects of the various biodiesel production methods currently implemented to the best of our knowledge are discussed here, which include in-situ biodiesel production, both catalysed (homogeneous and heterogeneous systems) and uncatalysed classical production approaches, with emphasis on how each of these approaches are affected by their reaction parameters. The review also highlights the observed drawbacks of each process with a view to assessing the implementation of supercritical and superheated technologies as an alternative, economically feasible advancement.
   Supercritical process (SCP) has shown great prospect in the obtainment of high quality biodiesel from a wide range of high to low grade feedstock with minimal impacts on the presence of water or FFAs (free fatty acids). From available literature it is shown that these do not affect the process significantly, and various other supercritical fluids such as methyl acetate, tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) and dimethyl carbonate can also be used to avoid glycerol formation. The process however, suffers from high initial implementation cost being the most prominent drawback, among others like thermal degradation of the fuel. Another promising technique, the superheated vapour technology (SHV) has emerged as an alternative, with limited literature proving the superiority of either of these processes to be inconclusive. In future works, researchers need to look into various aspects such as developing a spiral reactor for heat recovery, using software based optimization for eliminating redundant experiments analysing production cost for industrial scale-up and improving the fuel's oxidative stability by adding antioxidants for convenient long-term storage and use.

AB The lubricant oil can prevent the leakages and reduce the expander friction losses, but blend with the pure working fluid because of the absence of oil separator and affect eventually the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) operation characteristic. Based on a 3 kW ORC experimental prototype, the effect of lubricant oil ratio (1.2%, 3.1%, 5.0%, 6.7% and 9.0%) using R123 on the system behavior under three different degree of superheating (5, 10 and 15 degrees C) has been investigated. The heat source temperature is fixed at 130 degrees C, while the mass flow rate is controlled by adjusting the pump frequency. The heat input is first amended, and the detailed components' behaviors are examined. The system overall performance, including thermal efficiency and system generating efficiency is explored. Results demonstrated that the deviation between the calculated heat input and modified heat input is no more than 5%. The lubricant oil enhances the pump behavior, whereas deteriorates the expander shaft power and electrical power. Meanwhile, the thermal efficiency is insensitive on the lubricant oil ratio for a degree of superheating higher than 10 degrees C. The system generating efficiencies for degree of superheating of 10 and 15 degrees C are in range of 5.44-5.61% (3.03%) and 5.34-5.69% (6.15%), respectively.

AB A comparative study on various solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-combined heat and power system layout designs is conducted to suggest its optimized structure. Thermodynamic models of a SOFC stack and balance of plant components are developed by using empirical correlations dependent on their design variables. 14 potential system layout designs are categorized by thermal integration methods through rigorous literature review and evaluated for their thermodynamic feasibility and performance by T-Q diagram analysis. Results show that preemptive air heating prior to combustion of stack exhaust gases or fuel heating is not thermodynamically feasible due to substantial heat transfer during air heating. Independent heat recuperation of the anode exhaust gas from a SOFC stack also shows thermodynamic non-viability given its low heat capacity rate. 4 effective layouts are selected and further investigated by proceeding detailed thermodynamic analysis. The system layout employing direct combustion just after the SOFC stack and branching of the hot gas stream (combustion gas) results in the pressure drop of 23.5 kPa and parasitic power of 1.04 kW (less than 5% of gross power). These are 2-4 times smaller than those of other layouts. Accordingly, the proposed layout provides the highest electrical efficiency of 55.5% and exergetic efficiency of 53.5%.

AB The heat source and sink temperatures are important external variables that determine the performance of power cycles, such as the ideal Carrot cycle and Rankine cycle. In addition to these external operating variables, variations in the mass flow rate within the system can significantly change the operating characteristics of the power cycle. In this study, the combined effects of these operating variables on the compact Rankine cycle performance were investigated experimentally. A compact ORC with R245fa working fluid and scroll expander was experimentally evaluated at 100-140 degrees C heat source, 10-30 degrees C heat sink and 0.042-0.060 kg/s mass flow rate conditions.
   Comprehensive experiments showed that the external parameters have significant effects on ORC operating temperature and pressure. In particular, the electrical output was well predicted by the parameter of change in the pressure difference rather than the expansion ratio of the expander. It was also found that the mechanical efficiency of expander increased nonlinearly when decreasing the heat source temperature and increasing the pressure difference of expander. The generator efficiency was not affected by the operating parameters as the expander rotational speed was linearly proportional to the electrical power. The maximum system performance showed 0.246 kW electrical output and 1.61% thermal efficiency in contrast to 0.796 kW net fluidic output and 5.72% fluidic thermal efficiency where they were in different conditions.

AB The ongoing requirements for fuel in meeting the ever-growing demand in commercial sector have pushed researchers in finding and optimizing the production of biofuels from cheap sources, enabling for a sustainable production. The present study aims at bridging the gap in optimizing the process parameters which are required for converting cheap waste cooking oil (WCO) into methyl esters, using cost effective source of heterogeneous catalyst (Egg shells). Characterization of synthesized calcium oxide (CaO) and the methyl esters were performed. Catalyst calcinations temperature (C-Temp), catalyst calcinations time (C-Time), catalyst loading (C-L), alcohol to oil ratio (A(O)), reaction temperature (R-Temp) and reaction time (R-Time) were being analyzed in a 3-level-6-factor array using an L27 Taguchi orthogonal array (OA). Response surface methodology (RSM) optimization and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test are carried out for determining the most significant parameter. Amongst the entire variable, the transesterification reaction temperatures have a contribution of 30.14%, followed by calcinations temperature with 29.70%. A confirmation test is conducted using the optimal values from both RSM and ANOVA and a yield of 96.6 +/- 0.05% and 96.3 +/- 0.10% respectively is obtained which is more than the predicted value of 96.08% and at par with studies of researchers work. Thus, at same OA design, RSM and ANOVA can be equally applied for optimization.

AB The objective of this work is the investigation of a solar-driven organic Rankine cycle with nanofluid-based solar dish concentrator. Three different cavity receivers are tested with the alumina/oil nanofluid in order to determine the most effective choice. More specifically, the examined cavities are hemispherical, cubical, and cylindrical, while the organic Rankine cycle is a non-regenerated system with superheating, R601 working fluid and heat rejection temperature at 310 K. The analysis is perfumed using the first and the second thermodynamic laws. The organic Rankine cycle is investigated for different pressure in the turbine inlet and different nano particle concentrations are also studied. According to the results, the thermal performance of the cavity and the electricity production are improved by decreasing alumina nanoparticle size, and by increasing the nanofluid concentration. Moreover, the optimum pressure in the turbine inlet was found at 2 MPa. Finally, the hemispherical cavity receiver has been found to be the best choice with cubical to be the second one and the cylindrical to be the less effective choice.

AB Biomass is one of the encouraging renewable energy sources to mitigate uncertainties in the future energy supply and to address the climate change caused by the increased CO2 emissions. Conventionally, thermal energy is produced from biomass via combustion process with low thermodynamic efficiency. Conversely, gasification of biomass integrated with innovative power generation technologies, such as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), offers much higher conversion efficiency. Typically, energy conversion process has multiple conflicting performance criteria, such as capital and operating costs, annual profit, thermodynamic performance and environment impact. Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) methods are used to found the optimal compromise in the objective function space, and also to acquire the corresponding optimal values of decision variables. This work investigates integration and optimization of a Sorption Enhanced Steam Biomass Gasification (SEG) with a SOFC and Gas Turbine (GT) system for the production of power and heat from Eucalyptus wood chips. The energy system model is firstly developed in Aspen Plus simulator, which has five main units: (1) SEG coupled with calcium looping for hydrogen-rich gas production, (2) hot gas cleaning and steam reforming, (3) SOFC-GT for converting hydrogen into electricity, (4) catalytic burning and CO2 compression, and (5) cement production from the purge CaO stream of SEG unit. Then, the design and operating variables of the conversion system are optimized for annual profit, annualized total capital cost, operating cost and exergy efficiency, using MOO. Finally, for the implementation purpose, two selection methods and parametric uncertainty analysis are performed to identify good solutions from the Pareto-optimal front.

AB Supercritical CO2 cycles have been said to be a good alternative to the Rankine Cycles for Concentrating Solar Power plants of the future. The next generation molten salts will be able to achieve 700 degrees C, which is a suitable temperature for Supercritical CO2 cycles. However, there is a big uncertainty about the efficiencies of the cycle components, which could make these cycles unviable. A sensitivity analysis of the energy efficiency of the Recompression Cycle and Partial Cooling Cycle, regarding turbomachinery isentropic efficiencies and Recuperator effectiveness variations, has been carried out to show that the Recompression Cycle's energy efficiency is considerably more sensitive than the Partial Cooling Cycle's. From the sensitivity analysis, it can also be concluded that the Recompression Cycle is the best performing cycle for most of the studied cases, with energy efficiencies in the range between 32.97% and 51.91%. Exergetically, the Recompression Cycle is also more suitable in most situations, and the exergy analysis on cycle components shows that irreversibilities occur mainly in the Recuperators, which means that future research should focus on methods to reduce irreversibilities in these components.
   The state-of-the-art of Supercritical Rankine Cycle plant net energy efficiencies currently reach 45.60% for fossil fuel plants. Although Supercritical CO2 cycles are a simpler and more compact alternative, this work concludes that only the optimized Recompression Cycle with turbomachinery isentropic efficiencies over 92% and Recuperator effectiveness over 95% are able to obtain similar or higher efficiencies than actual Supercritical Rankine Cycles. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis plots permit the areas to be mapped where each of the optimized two-cycle efficiencies can compete with the Supercritical Rankine Cycles regarding the turbo machinery isentropic efficiencies and Recuperator effectiveness.

AB By focusing on the increase of the input energy, a recovery system is introduced, in which a combination between the internal combustion engine cooling system and a low-temperature Rankine cycle is established. The entire waste heat of the engine cooling fluid is absorbed in the low-temperature Rankine cycle through a low mass flow rate of the working fluid. This not only leads to increased efficiency and power of the system, but also to a smaller size for the recovery system. This system is shown to recover more than 57% of the available energy in the cooling fluid. In addition, the traditional radiator of the engine cooling system is eliminated.
   By the application of the thermodynamic analysis to 19 different working fluids, appropriate matching conditions between the low-temperature Rankine cycle with the engine cooling system and the properties of the working fluid were examined. It was concluded that, Ammonia had the highest compatibility with the proposed system. The analysis of the sensitivity of the ambient temperature for the low-temperature Rankine cycle was performed with Ammonia as the working fluid, and it was observed that a variation in the ambient temperature has a small effect on the cooling fluid temperature. Finally, the results derived from the low-temperature Rankine cycle were compared with the results available from six other research work. This comparison showed that the extent to which it is possible to obtain the available energy in the cooling system by the proposed system with a low mass flow rate is much higher than those obtained by those six researches.

AB The energy optimization method of HVAC system from a holistic perspective for the energy optimal selection of the HVAC system for an operating theater is presented in the article. All subsystems and the HVAC system as a whole are described in the vector form, whereas the sets of all the possible subsystems and systems variants as a whole are described in the matrix form as a constant parameters function and decision variables function. The system analysis and matrix calculus are applied in order to determine the sets of acceptable subsystems and systems variants. The total review of acceptable solutions methods with the use of the objective function is applied as the method for the optimal variant determination. The objective function is the annual primal energy demand for each acceptable system based on the simulation models. It has been shown that as a result of the HVAC system structure optimization, savings in the annual primary energy demand can be achieved of 4.4-6.5% - for thermodynamic processing and of 2.5-4.3%- in total for transfer and thermodynamic processing of air. It has also been shown that for an optimal structure of the HVAC system, the extension of the admissible tolerance range of relative humidity in the operating room from 50% ("on point") to 40-60%, allows to achieve primary energy savings of 34.9% - for thermodynamic processing and of 22.8% - in total for transfer and thermodynamic processing of air.

AB Distributed energy system has received increasing attention nowadays because of its great advantages on utilizing waste heat in cascade and renewable energy flexibly. This paper proposed a solar-assisted combined power and cooling system (SCPC) which supplies power and cooling capacity at two different temperature levels for a cold storage. The cogeneration system is composed of an internal combustion engine, evacuated tube collectors, a heat storage tank and an ammonia-water combined power and cooling system. The exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine is used to generate superheated ammonia-water vapor in the ammonia-water power generation subcycle. The jacket water waste heat is recovered and assisted by the solar collector field to drive the absorption-compression subcycle. Simulation work of the proposed system was conducted, and its performance was analyzed and evaluated from the aspects of energy and exergy. Thermal efficiency of the SCPC system is 70.35% with the renewable energy ratio of 18.1%, and its exergy efficiency is 45.52%. Combined with the coefficient of exergy destruction, average energy level difference was proposed and defined to analyze the energy saving mechanism and further improvement potential of the proposed system. The effects of key parameters including turbine inlet pressure and generation pressure in low-pressure reboiler at different condensation/absorption temperatures have been investigated, providing guidance for the system's optimal design.

AB A latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) system is an efficient thermal battery using a phase change material (PCM) for key applications of intermittent renewable energy. In this study, a flexible elliptical-shaped capsule is investigated and subsequently proposed as a container of the PCM used for LHTES. The novel elliptical PCM capsule is made of polyethylene and designed to achieve maximum enhancement of heat transfer. The thermal flow inside the capsule is analyzed via the combined methods of particle image velocimetry and laser induced fluorescence. In the present study, the upward and downward motion of a solid PCM lump in an elliptical capsule are reported for the first time. This is shown to increase the heat transfer rate by more than twice that of a spherical capsule. A prototype heat storage tank with 1000 L of water and 500 kg of the PCM is fabricated for application as a large-scale thermal battery. Consequently, the developed PCM capsule exhibits a decrease of 50% and 35% in the charging and discharging process time, respectively.

AB High titer ethanol production from rice straw using Mucor indicus fungus was investigated through the solid-state simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSSF) process. The straw was pretreated with 0.5 M sodium carbonate solution for 3, 5, and 10 h to improve the efficiency of the process. Effects of the pretreatment on the composition, structural morphology, cellulose crystallinity, swelling capacity, and buffering capacity of the straw were studied. Moreover, the effects of SSSF reaction time, enzyme loading, and solid loading on glucose and ethanol production were investigated. Additionally, the nutritional value of the residue from the SSSF process, as an animal feedstock, was determined in terms of lipid and protein contents. The highest total sugar concentration was 89.2 g/L, obtained from the straw pretreated for 10 h after hydrolysis with 10 FPU/g straw at 15% (w/w) solid loading. Total sugars concentration was not significantly improved by increasing the pretreatment time at low enzyme loadings, whereas it was significantly improved at high enzyme loadings. The highest ethanol concentration and SSSF yield were 99.4 g/L and 89.5% (71.8% based on the raw material), achieved from the straw pretreated for 10 h through the 72-h SSSF at 30% and 15% solid loading, respectively, using 20 FPU/g straw. The low enzyme loadings of 2.5 and 5 FPU/g straw yielded ethanol with concentrations as high as 66.3 and 90.9 g/L, respectively, after 120-h fermentation at 30% solid loading from the straw pretreated for 5 h.

AB Within the scope of the energy transition an increasing share of intermittent renewable energy sources demand for grid balancing energy storage technologies, for which a novel zero-emission methanol based energy storage system is introduced. The objective is to establish the feasibility of this system as a grid balancing energy storage method, based on thermal efficiency and cost, at an input power of 50 MW,1 and boundary conditions that are set to reflect geographically independent operation. The main components are determined to be a PEM electrolyser followed by a recirculating catalytic synthesis reactor for methanol production. Alternatives for power generation are a transcritical carbon dioxide gas turbine (tCO2-GT), a supercritical carbon dioxide gas turbine (sCO2-GT) and a combination of methanol steam reforming and PEM fuel cell (MSR-PEMFC). Modelling of the entire system with respectively tCO2-GT, sCO2-GT and MSR-PEMFC for power generation leads to a system energy efficiency of 30.1%, 26.5% and 24.1%. Levelised cost of storage is estimated to be respectively 0.24 $/kWh, 0.25 $/kWh and 0.34 $/kWh based on equipment cost estimations and factorial estimates, provisionally not taking into account the variable operational costs due to the extent of uncertainty in specifically catalyst type and degradation. Hence, based on these results the most efficient and cost effective system configuration is the tCO2-GT which can be competitive with hydrogen seasonal energy storage systems. sCO2-GT thermodynamic efficiency can be improved if cost effective solutions are found for temperature constraints. Furthermore, detailed elaboration of individual components and grid modelling of the system should lead to more accurate results and possibly increased thermodynamic performance. Concluding, when further elaborated the proposed system could be a practical solution to seasonal energy storage.

AB Photovoltaic modeling has attracted researchers' attention worldwide because of its importance in the photovoltaic system design. Therefore, several photovoltaic models have been introduced as static and dynamic photovoltaic models. Moreover, a novel fractional order dynamic photovoltaic model has been recently developed to enhance the accuracy and flexibility of the conventional integral order one. The unknown parameters of these models should be extracted accurately to achieve a proper photovoltaic system design and operation. In this work, novel Chaotic Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer variants are introduced, where the Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer is combined with ten different chaos maps to adapt its parameters. Six Chaotic Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer variants are proposed in addition to the standard Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer version to identify the parameters of both the static and the dynamic models based on different experimental datasets. To demonstrate the superiority of the developed variants, their results are compared to the most recent state-of-the-art algorithms with the aid of statistical analysis methods. The main outcome is that, in both of the static and the dynamic photovoltaic models, the Chaotic Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer variants show their efficiency, accuracy and robustness not only over Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer but also over recently published algorithms. They provide better fitting relative to the experimental datasets with the least deviation error and the fastest convergence speed as well. In the case of static models, the fourth variant of Chaotic Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer with an iterative map for the single diode model, the third variant of Chaotic Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer with singer map for the double diode model of solar cell. On the other hand, for the dynamic models, the second Chaotic Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer variant with sinusoidal map for the integral order dynamic photovoltaic model and the sixth variant of Chaotic Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer with Gauss/mouse map for the fractional order dynamic photovoltaic model offer the best performance.
