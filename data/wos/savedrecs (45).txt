AB H1N1, one of the most prevalent influenza A virus subtypes affecting the human population, can cause infections varying from mild respiratory syndrome to severe pneumonia. The current H1N1 vaccine needs to be updated annually and does not protect against future outbreaks. Here, we downloaded 2,656 HA protein sequences of human HI NI viruses from the NCBI influenza database (up to the date of Aug. 2012) and constructed a phylogenetic tree of these H1 proteins via the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 5.0 software. A consensus H1 protein (CH1) was generated and was further modified with published conserved 1-cell and B-cell epitopes. Interestingly, this CH1 protein is genetically similar to an H1 isolate obtained during the 1980s (A/Memphis/7/1980), indicating that a universal HA antigen may exist in nature. Vaccination with a DNA vaccine expressing CH1 elicited broadly reactive 1-cell and B-cell responses to heterologous HI NI viruses, though this vaccine did not successfully neutralize pdm09 H1N1 viruses. A combination of CH1 and pdm09 HA in a DNA vaccination neutralized pdm09 Hi NI viruses and protected mice from lethal infections by all representative H1N1 viruses. Moreover, a recombinant chimeric PR8-CH1 virus carrying HA sequence of the consensus H1 and all other seven genes from the PR8 strain was highly attenuated in mice, with a lethal dose (LD50) of more than 10(6) pfu. Vaccination with PR8-CH1 virus provided complete protection against infections by heterologous H1N1 strains. Taken together, a universal H1 antigen, CH1, was developed by constructing a consensus HA sequence, and the PR8-CH1 virus containing this consensus sequence elicited broadly protective immunity against heterologous H1N1 viruses.

AB Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been used as a vector in the development of vaccines and gene therapy. A majority of these NDV vectors express only a single foreign gene through either an independent transcription unit (ITU) or an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). In the present study, we combined the ITU and IRES methods to generate a novel NDV LaSota strain-based recombinant virus vectoring the red fluorescence protein (RFP) and the green fluorescence protein (GFP) genes. Biological assessments of the recombinant virus, rLS/IRES-RFP/GFP, showed that it was slightly attenuated in vivo, yet maintained similar growth dynamics and viral yields in vitro when compared to the parental LaSota virus. Expression of both the RFP and GFP was detected from the rLS/IRES-RFP/GFP virus-infected DF-1 cells by fluorescence microscopy. These data suggest that the rLS/IRES-RFP/GFP virus may be used as a multivalent vector for the development of vaccines and gene therapy agents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To estimate full hepatitis B vaccination coverage (uptake of >= 3 doses of vaccine) among health-care workers (HCWs) in Africa.
   Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed (R), Embase (R), CINAHL and Psych-Info databases for studies published from January 2010 to October 2017 that reported full hepatitis B vaccination coverage among HCWs in Africa. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to determine pooled estimates of full vaccination coverage.
   Results: Of the 331 articles identified, 35 studies from 15 African countries met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The estimated full hepatitis B vaccination coverage was 24.7% (95% Cl: 17.332.0). Regional coverage was highest in northern Africa (62.1%, 95% CI: 42.5-81.7) and lowest in central Africa (13,4%, 95% CI: 4.5-22.3). Doctors were more likely (OR: 2.6,95% Cl: 1.8-3.7) to be fully vaccinated than Nurses with estimated pooled estimates of 52.4% (95% CI: 31.1-73.8) and 26.3% (95% CI: 9.7-42.9), respectively. Also, HCWs with 10 or more years of experience were more likely to be vaccinated than those with less than 10 years of experience (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.5-3.3). The common reasons identified for non-vaccination of HCWs were unavailability of vaccine 50.5% (95% CI: 26.5-74.4), busy work schedule 37.5% (95% CI: 12.6-62.4) and cost of vaccination 18.4% (95% CI: 7,1-29.7).
   Conclusion: The evidence available suggests that many HCWs in Africa are at risk of Hepatitis B infection as only a quarter of them were fully vaccinated against Hepatitis B virus, This study highlights the need for all African governments to establish and implement hepatitis B vaccination policies for HCWs.

AB Background: This systematic review aims to describe the prevalence, trends, and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19A (Spn19A) that causes invasive and non-invasive diseases in children <5 years in Latin-American and Caribbean countries.
   Methods: We searched for published (between January 2010 and February 2016) observational and clinical studies within the region including effectiveness and impact on Spnl9A after pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction. We calculated prevalence estimates by country and standardized the frequency of isolates to conduct an interrupted time series analysis for selected countries and to assess the potential changes in disease trends, overall and for Spn19A.
   Results: We identified and reviewed full-text of 89 publications and included 59 in the analysis. Data from the laboratory surveillance network, SIREVA, were included in 43 (74%) of the invasive pneumococcal disease reports. There are differences in the sensitivity, representativeness, and heterogeneity of laboratory surveillance. There has been and overall reduction in the trend and number of invasive S. pneumoniae isolates in children <5 years after PCVs introduction. To date, the prevalence of Spnl9A has increased, however, there has been no observed change in the trend.
   Conclusions: This updated systematic review provides evidence of a reduction in the total number of invasive pneumococcal disease isolates after the introduction of PCVs in the region but cannot yet conclude a change in the trend of Spn19A disease.

DT Article

ID ARTHRITIS; COVERAGE; CARE; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; AUSTRIA
AB Background: Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases are at higher risk for influenza and current guidelines recommend vaccination for this group of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vaccination coverage and predictors for influenza vaccination among patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
   Methods: This survey was conducted at the outpatient rheumatology clinic at the Medical University of Vienna between July and October 2017. All patients diagnosed with an inflammatory rheumatic disease and receiving immunosuppressive therapy were asked to complete a questionnaire about their influenza vaccination status for 2016/17.
   Results: 490 patients with rheumatic diseases completed a questionnaire (33% male, mean age 55.3 years). The influenza vaccination rate for the previous season was 25.3% (n = 124/490). Predictors for a positive influenza vaccination status were higher age (Adjusted Odds Ratio 5.0, 95% Confidence Interval 2.4-10.4) and treatment with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.1). Patients who received a recommendation for influenza vaccination by their general practitioner were significantly more likely to be vaccinated than those who did not (57% vs. 15%, AOR 6.6, 95% CI 4.1-10.8); even more so if they received a recommendation by their rheumatologist (62% vs. 19%, AOR 9.0, 95% Cl 4.9-16.5). The main reasons for patients to decline influenza vaccination were fear of side effects (36%), concerns that vaccination might not be effective due to their immunosuppressed condition (38%) or that it might worsen the rheumatic disease (20%).
   Conclusions: A moderate influenza vaccination rate of 25.3% was detected among patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Recommendation of the influenza vaccine by a physician exerts the most effective impact on a positive vaccination status. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effective vaccines are needed to combat diarrheal diseases due to Shigella. Two live oral S. sonnei vaccine candidates, WRSs2 and WRSs3, attenuated principally by the lack of spreading ability, as well as the loss of enterotoxin and acyl transferase genes, were tested for safety and immunogenicity.
   Healthy adults 18-45 years of age, assigned to 5 cohorts of 18 subjects each (WRSs2 (n = 8), WRSs3 (n = 8) or placebo (n = 2)) were housed in an inpatient facility and administered a single oral dose of study agent 5 min after ingestion of oral bicarbonate. Ascending dosages of vaccine (from 10(3) CFU to 10(7) CFU) were evaluated. On day 8, treatment with ciprofloxacin (500 mg BID for 3 days) was initiated and subjects were discharged home 2 days after completing antibiotics. Subjects returned for outpatient visits on day 14, 28 and 56 post-vaccination for monitoring and collection of stool and blood samples.
   Both WRSs2 and WRSs3 were generally well tolerated and safe over the entire dose range. Among the 80 vaccinees, 11 subjects developed diarrhea, 8 of which were mild and did not affect daily activities. At the 10(7) CFU dose, moderate diarrhea occurred in one WRSs2 subject while at the same dose of WRSs3, 2 subjects had moderate or severe diarrhea. Vaccinees mounted dose-dependent mucosal and systemic immune responses that appeared to correlate with fecal shedding.
   S. sonnei vaccine candidates WRSs2 and WRSs3 are safe and immunogenic over a wide dose range. Future steps will be to select the most promising candidate and move to human challenge models for efficacy of the vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Public health authorities have the resources to conduct efficient immunization reminder interventions to improve vaccine uptake. The objective of this initiative was to design and implement a cost-effective centralized HPV vaccine reminder using New York State Immunization Information System data as one of five prespecified activities to increase initiation and completion among 11- to 13-year-old adolescents.
   Methods: The New York State Department of Health sent reminder letters to the parents or guardians of eligible adolescents who were due for the first dose of HPV vaccine and observed HPV vaccine administration in the six months after each mailing. Subjects were randomized into an intervention group, mailed on May 14, 2015 and a control group, mailed on December 8, 2015.
   Results: The analysis consisted of 81,558 eligible letter recipients. Letter recipients were 2 percent more likely to initiate vaccination than control subjects. Significant increases in vaccine uptake were observed for all age and gender strata. The intervention cost was $30.95 for each adolescent who initiated the HPV vaccine series. New York State Department of Health received far less public feedback, including negative feedback, about this intervention that was originally anticipated.

TI Reduction of influenza virus transmission from mice immunized against

AB Transmission of influenza virus between susceptible hosts mediates spread of infection in the population and can occur via direct-contact or airborne routes. Mathematical models suggest that vaccines that reduce viral transmission from infected individuals could substantially reduce viral spread in an epidemic or pandemic, even if they do not completely protect against infection. Vaccines targeting conserved nucleoprotein (A/NP) and matrix 2 (M2) antigens of influenza virus do not completely prevent infection upon influenza virus challenge, but reduce viral replication, morbidity, and mortality. Using a mouse model of influenza virus transmission, we have previously shown that immunization with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the combination of A/NP and M2 can reduce viral transmission to unimmunized contacts. Here we demonstrate that transmission reduction is more effective when mice are immunized against A/NP and M2 intranasally than via the intramuscular route. We show that immunization against the combination of A/NP and M2 is more effective at reducing transmission than either antigen alone, with a clear hierarchy of effectiveness (A/NP + M2 > A/NP > M2). Transmission reduction is seen to a similar degree under both direct-contact and airborne transmission conditions. Finally, using seroconversion as an indicator of infection, we show that immunizing contact mice against A/NP and M2 prevents a significant fraction (similar to 50%) from becoming infected under direct-contact conditions. These findings suggest that when strain-matched vaccines are unavailable, conserved antigen vaccines could not only reduce severity of disease in vaccinated individuals but also limit the spread of virus during influenza epidemics or pandemics.

AB In the US, rabies lyssavirus (RABV) only circulates in wildlife species and the most significant reservoir from a public and animal health perspective is the raccoon (Procyon lotor). Management of wildlife rabies relies principally on oral rabies vaccination (ORV) strategies using vaccine-laden bait delivery to free-ranging target hosts, in order to reduce the susceptible population to prevent the spread of and eliminate RABV circulation. Our objective was to evaluate efficacy of the Ontario Rabies Vaccine Bait (ONRAB) against a lethal RABV challenge in captive raccoons. Sham or live vaccine baits were offered to 50 raccoons and efficacy was evaluated in 46, split into two trials of 17 and 29 raccoons. Raccoons were challenged with a lethal dose of RABV 180 days post-vaccination and observed for 90 days post-infection. Raccoon bait interactions were assigned increasing integer scores for approach, oral manipulation, puncture, and consumption behaviors. Higher bait interaction scores were observed in the fall compared to the spring trial, indicating that more raccoons consumed baits in the fall. Although animal age did not explain variation in bait interaction scores, the geometric mean rabies virus antibody titers among juvenile vaccinates were higher than adults at all pre-challenge time points. The prevented fraction associated with ONRAB delivery was 0.73 (8/11, 95% CI 0.39-0.94) in the spring trial and 0.91 (21/23, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) in the fall trial. All sham-vaccinated raccoons (12/12) succumbed to rabies infection, in contrast to 15% (5/34) mortality among vaccinated raccoons. Our results indicate a high efficacy of ONRAB bait vaccination in protecting adult and juvenile raccoons against RABV infection for a minimum of six months. These data complement experimental field trials that have also demonstrated the potential of ONRAB for the control and prevention of RABV circulation in free-ranging raccoon populations in the US.

AB Condyloma acuminatum (CA) represents a significant human papillomavirus (HPV) disease burden worldwide, resulting in substantial healthcare costs and loss of life quality in both genders. To address this problem, we tried to develop a bivalent HPV6/11 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine targeting CA. HPV6/11 VLPs were generated in Hansenula polymorpha, and a disassembly and reassembly (D/R) treatment was further conducted to improve the stability and monodispersity of the VLPs. The HPV6/11 VLPs were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrum (MS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), and were evaluated for their immunogenicity in both mice and cynomolgus monkeys. The results showed that the HPV6/11 Ll proteins were correctly expressed and assembled into HPV6/11 VLPs, and the HPV6/11 VLPs formulated with aluminum phosphate induced vigorous production of specific neutralizing antibodies against HPV6/11 VLPs in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. These data indicated that the Hansenula polymorpha-derived HPV6/11 VLPs could be formulated into a bivalent vaccine used in prevention of CA. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DELIVERY; TRIAL
AB Background: To attain high coverage during polio vaccination campaigns, an outreach house-to-house strategy is used to administer oral poliovirus vaccine. Administering an injectable vaccine house-to-house requires a skilled work force and increases risks of needle stick injuries. Needle-free injection devices provide a safer alternative to needles and syringes for administering injectable vaccines. We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a needle-free injection device to administer injectable poliovirus vaccine during a house-to-house vaccination outreach activity.
   Methods: Vaccination teams administered injectable poliovirus vaccine using the Pharmajet (R) needle-free intramuscular jet injector to children ages 6-59 months in 766 homes. Data on the feasibility of using the jet injector in an outreach campaign setting and the acceptability of the jet injector by caregivers and vaccinators were collected.
   Results: A total of 993 injections were administered. Vaccinators faced challenges during device preparation in 16% (n = 158) of injections; challenges were related to problems loading the injector and not having a flat surface to use for setup of the injector. Among 32 vaccinators interviewed after the vaccination campaign, the main reported advantage of the device was absence of sharps disposal (91%) while the main reported disadvantage was unacceptability by parents (90%) which was related to the vaccine, not the device.
   Conclusions: The needle-free jet injector was feasible for use in house-to-house campaigns. Acceptability by vaccinators was low as 81% stated that the jet injector was not easier to use than needle and syringe. Parental refusal related to frequent polio vaccination campaigns was the biggest challenge. In addition, novelty of the device posed a challenge to teams as they needed to reassure parents about safety of the device. To take full advantage of the ability to take injectable vaccines door-to-door during vaccination campaigns using a needle-free jet injector device, tailored social mobilization efforts are needed ahead of campaigns.

AB Pneumonia and diarrhea are the leading causes of child morbidity and mortality globally and are vaccine preventable. The WHO-coordinated Global Rotavirus and Invasive Bacterial Vaccine-Preventable Disease Surveillance Networks support surveillance systems across WHO regions to provide burden of disease data for countries to make evidence-based decisions about introducing vaccines and to demonstrate the impact of vaccines on disease burden. These surveillance networks help fill the gaps in data in low and middle-income countries where disease burden and risk are high but support to sustain surveillance activities and generate data is low. Through a series of country case studies, this paper reviews the successful use of surveillance data for disease caused by pneumococcus and rotavirus in informing national vaccine policy in Bangladesh, Armenia and The Gambia. The case studies delve into ways in which countries are leveraging and building capacity in existing surveillance infrastructure to monitor other diseases of concern in the country. Local institutions have been identified to play a critical role in making surveillance data available to policymakers. We recommend that countries review local or regional surveillance data in making vaccine policy decisions. Documenting use of surveillance activities can be used as advocacy tools to convince governments and external funders to invest in surveillance and make it a priority immunization activity.

AB Background: Cuba has a new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate (PCV7-TT). This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity in healthy infants using 2p+1 vaccination schedule.
   Methods: A phase I, controlled, randomized and double blind clinical trial was designed. 30 unvaccinated healthy infants were included. 20 subjects were assigned to study group (PCV7-TT) and 10 to control group (Synfiorix (R)) to receive the vaccines at 7, 8 months of age (primary series) and 11 months (booster dose). Blood samples were collected 30 days after second dose and post booster for antibodies measure analysis by ELISA and OPA. The statistics analysis included the frequency of occurrence for adverse events and the immune response. Non-parametric tests were used to compare the immune response. The clinical trial was published in the Cuban Public Register of Clinical Trials with code RPCEC00000173 available at http://registroclinico.sld.cu.
   Results: Overall, the safety profile of PCV7-TT was similar to Synflorix (R) . Local reactions were predominant and systemic events were mild in severity. Swelling and redness were frequently associated with PCV7-TT mainly after the first dose (50% and 40% respectively). 15% and 10% of subject reported severe swelling after first dose with PCV7-TT and after second dose with Synfiorix (R) . Mild fever (>= 38-<= 39), vomiting and sleep disturb were the systemic events reported. 100% of infants achieved pneumococcal IgG antibody concentrations >= 0.35 mu g/ml after booster dose for serotypes 1, 14, 18C and 19F in each vaccine group. For serotypes 5, 6B and 23F, more than 80% infants vaccinated with Synfiorix (R) or PCV7-IT achieved protective IgG GMC >= 0.35 mu g/ml after booster dose. OPA proportion's responders to the seven common serotypes were 89.5% or more after the primary dose and 100% after booster dose in vaccinated with PCV7-TT.
   Conclusions: The Cuban PCV7-17 is safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in healthy infants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluation of an adult immunization composite measure in the Indian

AB Background: Government agencies, healthcare accreditation bodies and quality improvement organizations support the development of new quality measures. Composite quality measures use more than one measure to develop a broader assessment of healthcare system function. Currently, no composite measures for adult immunization coverage exist. Development of such measures could facilitate improvements in adult immunization coverage by focusing on measurement of receipt of all age-recommended vaccines.
   Methods: We recruited five Indian Health Service (IHS) and Tribal health clinics to pilot an Adult Immunization Composite Measure (AICM). Data were collected monthly over seven months using a pre-programmed electronic health record (EHR) reporting tool (IHS sites); Tribal sites used third-party software or a programmable EHR reporting function. Data collected included: number of adults aged 19 years and over who were active users of the facility with at least two visits in the last three years; the cumulative number fully immunized per age-based recommendations for tetanus toxoidcontaining vaccines, pertussis, zoster and pneumococcal vaccines; and the percent immunized for the AICM and for each individual vaccine. Coverage was calculated for three age groups: 19-59 years; 60-64 years; and 65 years and older.
   Results: All sites reported aggregate immunization data monthly from patient EHR records. For all adults 19 years and older, AICM coverage ranged from 49% to 87% at the end of the report period. Two sites showed increases in AICM coverage >= 3%. Improvements in zoster vaccine coverage accounted for most of the increase observed. One site specifically focused on improving zoster coverage as a result of using the AICM.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a composite measure of adult immunization coverage. This is the first measure capable of monitoring immunization completeness, coverage improvement and overall adult vaccine program effectiveness for adults who receive all recommended, age-based vaccines.

TI Engagement of private providers in immunization in the Western Pacific
   region
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Immunization; Private providers
AB Financial sustainability of national immunization programmes (NIPS) in the Western Pacific is a growing concern. In the face of decreasing donor support for public immunization programmes, the role of private providers is becoming growingly important in attaining and sustaining programme achievements. Two-thirds of Member States in the Region have engaged the private sector in their immunization programmes, however little is known about the range and type of engagement. A survey was conducted in 2016 to map the scope and characteristics of private provider involvement, in order to inform guidance for decision makers. 14 countries participated, with responses from NIPs, national regulatory agencies, national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs), and private providers (defined as any entity other than the government).
   Findings revealed that most countries have policies and regulations concerning private providers, but 50% of private provider respondents were unaware that such policies are available. In most countries private providers' contribution is limited to less than 10% of the total target population. Private providers in only 6 countries surveyed follow the vaccination schedule recommended by the NIP, with demand by vaccine recipients being the main cause of deviation. A majority (>70%) of private provider respondents believe that clients seeks their services not because of perception of quality, but to access new vaccines unavailable through the NIP. Private providers in all countries received vaccines from the NIP at no cost, for which they only charge clients a service fee. The majority of private providers received training from the NIP, whereas only around 25% of them received training from their own institutions. Private providers from 11 countries share EPI performance data and adverse events following immunization, however, NIPs perceive this data as suboptimal. Private providers have a limited role in decision making processes, such as NITAGs. Further effective engagement of private sector providers has the potential to improve overall efficiency of immunization service delivery. (C) 2018 World Health Organization.

AB The Japanese ornamental carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Koi) is famous for multifarious colors and patterns, making it commonly culture and trade across the world. Although functional genes and inheritance of color traits have been commonly studied, seldom attentions were focused on the genetic regulation during the developmental process of pigmentation. To. better understand the mechanism of skin color development, we observed the morphogenesis of pigment cells during the post-embryonic stages and analysed the temporal expression pattern of mRNAs/miRNAs profiles in four distinct developmental stages. 59 and 103 differentially expressed genes/miRNAs (DEGs/DEMs) associated with pigmentation and skin were identified, including pax7, mitf, tyr, tyrp1, etc., and the highest DEGs were detected at 11 days post hatching (dph). In addition, the functional characteristics of mITAs/miRNAs associated with pteridine and carotenoid pathway were also examined. Furthermore, 65 miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs related to pigmentation, pteridines and carotenoids metabolism were detected between different stages. Interestingly, the largest pairs appeared in the transition from 11 dph to 48 dph, which had the similar trend with DEGs further manifesting the importance of 11 dph. This study produced a comprehensive programme of DEGs/DEMs during color development, which will provide resources to understand the regulation mechanism in color formation. The understanding of genetic basis in color formation might promote the production and breeding of the Koi carp.

AB Background: Hericium erinaceus, a famous edible mushroom, is also a well-known traditional medicinal fungus. To date, a large number of bioactive metabolites with antitumor, antibacterial, and immune-boosting effects were isolated from the free-living mycelium and fruiting body of H. erinaceus.
   Objective: Here we used the proteomic approach to explore proteins involved in the regulation of bioactive metabolites, including terpenoid, polyketide, sterol and etc.
   Results: Using mass spectrometry, a total of 2543 unique proteins were identified using H. erinaceus genome, of which 2449, 1855, 1533 and 690 proteins were successfully annotated in Nr, KOG, KEGG and GO databases. Among them, 722 proteins were differentially expressed (528 up- and 194 down-regulated) in fruiting body compared with mycelium. Most of differentially expressed proteins were putatively involved in energy metabolism, molecular signaling, and secondary metabolism. Additionally, numerous proteins involved in terpenoid, polyketide, and sterol biosynthesis were identified. Our data revealed that proteins involved in polyketide biosynthesis were up-regulated in the fruiting body, while some proteins in mevalonate (MEP) pathway from terpenoid biosynthesis were generally up-regulated in mycelium.
   Conclusions: The present study suggested that the differential regulation of biosynthesis genes could produce various bioactive metabolites with pharmacological effects in H. erinaceus.

AB Osteoclastogenesis is the rate-limiting step in tumor osteolytic metastasis. MicroRNAs play crucial roles in tumor progression and osteoclastogenesis regulation. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes are able to function as messengers that deliver microRNAs between cells. However, the effects of lung adenocarcinoma cell derived exosomal miRNAs in osteoclastogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that exosomes derived from A549 cells facilitate osteoclastogenesis. As miR-21 was involved in tumorigenesis and osteoclastogenesis, we further proved the existence of miR-21 in A549 cell-derived exosomes and investigated its function. MiR-21 overexpression in A549 cells led to increased levels of miR-21 in exosomes and facilitated osteoclastogenesis. Conversely, miR-21 depletion in A549 cells down-regulated miR-21 in exosomes and alleviated osteoclastogenesis. Mechanical experiments demonstrated that exosomal miR-21 exerted its promoting effects on osteoclastogenesis via targeting Pdcd4, which is a known target of miR-21 and a regulator of osteoclastogenesis. Finally, clinical data showed that higher miR-21 levels were associated with a worse overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients. In conclusion, we found that lung adenocarcinoma derived exosomal miR-21 may facilitate osteoclastogenesis, which suggests that it is a potential therapeutic target of bone metastasis.

AB Elongase of very long-chain fatty acids 6 (ELOVL6) is a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing elongation of saturated and monounsaturated long-chain fatty acid. Although functional characteristics of Elovl6 have been demonstrated in mammal, the role of elovl6 in fish remains unclear. In this study, we firstly cloned three isoforms of elovl6 (elovl6a, elovl6b and elovl6-like) from loath (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus). Molecular characterizations of the three elovl6 isoforms in loath and their expressions of early life stages and different tissues were then determined. We also functionally characterized the three elovl6 isoforms using heterologous expression in baker's yeast. Results obtained here showed the three elovl6 proteins in loath can elongate C16:0 and C16:1 to C18:0 and C18:1, respectively. At last, to confirm the role of three loath elovl6 isoforms for elongation of fatty acids in adaption to cold stress, differences in skin histological structures, body fatty acid compositions, expressions of four hepatic lipogenesis or lipolysis related genes, and expressions of the three elovl6 isoforms and their related gene uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1) in different tissues were investigated in the loath reared in two different water temperatures (28 degrees C and 4 degrees C) for ten days. Cold stress increased ratios of C18/C16 and C20:5n-3/C18:3n-3 in loath body, and induced expressions of hepatic acyl-CoA delta-9 desaturase 1 (scd1), sterol-regulator element binding protein 1 (srebp1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (cpt1) and fatty acid synthase (fas). Meanwhile, significant differences were found in expressions of the three elovl6 isoforms in different tissues between 28 degrees C and 4 degrees C groups. Overall, this study suggests that the three elovl6 isoforms in loath have ability to elongate C16 to C18, and elovl6 proteins in loath may play a role in adaptation to cold stress.

AB The PAX3 gene encodes a member of the PAX family of transcription factors that is characterized by a highly conserved paired box motif. The PAX3 protein is a transcription factor consisting of an N-terminal DNA binding domain (containing a paired box and homeodomain) and a C-terminal transcriptional activation domain. This protein is expressed during development of skeletal muscle, central nervous system and neural crest derivatives, and regulates expression of target genes that impact on proliferation, survival, differentiation and motility in these lineages. Germline mutations of the murine Pax3 and human PAX3 genes cause deficiencies in these developmental lineages and result in the Splotch phenotype and Waardenburg syndrome, respectively. Somatic genetic rearrangements that juxtapose the PAX3 DNA binding domain to the transcriptional activation domain of other transcription factors deregulate PAX3 function and contribute to the pathogenesis of the soft tissue cancers alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma. The wild-type PAX3 protein is also expressed in other cancers related to developmental lineages that normally express this protein and exerts phenotypic effects related to its normal developmental role.

AB The Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis) is an anadromous fish distributed in the Yangtze River and the East China Sea. In this study, we report the novel finding of cleft palates in Chinese sturgeons derived from artificial fertilization. To explore the genetic basis of palate malformation in A. sinensis, Illumina RNA-seq technology was used to analyze the transcriptome data of farmed Chinese sturgeons with normal palates and cleft-palates. Raw reads were obtained and assembled into 808,612 unigenes, with an average length of 509.33 bp and an N50 of 574 bp. Sequence similarity analyses against four public databases (Nr, UniProt, KEGG, and COGs) found 158,642 unigenes that could be annotated. GABAergic synapses and TGF-beta signal pathways were the two most enriched pathways with high Rich Factors in the analyses of differentially expressed genes. In these two signal pathways, six genes (GABRA4, GS, GNS, S6K, PITX2, and BMP8) were found as candidate cleft-palate genes in Chinese sturgeon. These findings contribute to our understanding of cleft palate genetics in sturgeon, while simultaneously adding to our knowledge about craniofacial development.

AB HSP90 beta 1 (known as glyco-protein 96, GP96) is a vital endoplasmic reticulum (ER) depended chaperonin among the HSPs (heat shock proteins) family. Furthermore, it always processes and presents antigen of the tumor and keeps balance for the intracellular environment. In the present study, we explored the effect of tributyltin chloride (TBT-Cl) exposure on HSP90 beta 1 expression in river pufferfish, Takifugu obscurus. The full length of To-HSP90 beta 1 was gained with 2775 bp in length, with an ORF (open reading frame) encoding an 803 aa polypeptide. A phylogenetic tree was constructed and showed the close relationship to other fish species. The HSP90 beta 1 mRNA transcript was expressed in all tissues investigated with higher level in the gill and liver. After the acute and chronic exposure of TBT-Cl, the To-HSP90 beta 1 mRNA transcript significantly was up-regulated in gills. Moreover, the histology study indicated the different injury degree of TBT-Cl in liver and gill. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining results implied the cytoplasm reorganization after TBT-Cl stress and the function of immunoregulation for To-HSP90 beta 1 to TBT-Cl exposure. All the results indicated that HSP90 beta 1 may be involved in the resistance to the invasion of TBT-CI for keeping autoimmune homeostasis.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors and one of the leading causes of cancer related death in both men and women. The prognosis of CRC remains poor due to the advanced stage and cancer metastasis at the time of diagnosis. However, the exact mechanism of tumorigenesis in CRC remains unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which refer to transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not translated into protein, are known to play important roles in multiple human cancers. Lnc-DILC is reported to be an important tumor suppressor gene and its inactivation is closely associated with liver cancer stem cells. However, the role of lnc-DILC in CRC remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we observed that lnc-DILC over expression inhibited the growth and metastasis of CRC cells. Consistently, lnc-DILC knockdown facilitated the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanically, Inc-DILC suppressed CRC cell progression via IL-6/STAT3 signaling inactivation. More importantly, the specific STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 and IL-6R inhibitor to-cilizumab abolished the discrepancy of growth and metastasis capacity between lnc-DILC-interference CRC cells and control cells, which further confirmed that IL-6/STAT3 signaling was required in Inc-DILC-disrupted CRC cell growth and metastasis. Taken together, our results suggest that Inc-DILC is a novel CRC suppressor and may prove to be an inhibitor of CRC progression by inactivating IL-6/STAT3 signaling.

AB Objective: To explore the role of functional genetic variant of IL12B in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometriosis.
   Study design: This study included 815 patients with ovarian endometriosis and 788 women in the control group. Two polymorphisms were genotyped by a method of polymerase chain reaction and ligase detection reaction. To assess the biological significance of polymorphisms, we detected the level of IL12p40 protein expression in patients' eutopic endometrial tissues using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
   Result(s): Compared with the CTCTAA/CTCTAA genotype, the GC/GC and GC/CTCTAA genotypes of rs17860508 could significantly increase the risk of ovarian endometriosis development (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.19-2.09; OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.08-1.74, respectively). Moreover, the IL12B mRNA was expressed at significantly higher levels in the eutopic endometrial tissue of patients with the GC/GC genotype than in patients with the CTCTAA/CTCTAA genotype. However, the rs3212227 polymorphism may not be associated with a risk of ovarian endometriosis.
   Conclusion(s): The rs17860508 polymorphism in the IL12B promoter region may influence the risk of developing ovarian endometriosis by altering the endometrial expression of IL12B of in Northern Chinese women.

AB Recently, the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which play important roles in various complex biological processes, have received more attention in plants. However, little information is available on lncRNAs in woody fruit trees and their potential regulatory roles remain poorly understood, especially in apple. Here, a total of 1726 high-confidence lncRNAs (hc-IncRNAs) were identified in different tissues including young fruits, shoot tips, stem phloem and root tips using high-throughput sequencing. These lncRNAs are distributed across all 17 apple chromosomes, and > 85% come from intergenic regions. The apple lncRNAs have longer transcript lengths and greater exon numbers than protein-coding genes. Additionally, among the 1726 hc-IncRNA, 850 are predicted to have target genes. These target genes are involved in many processes including hormone signaling, sugar metabolism, and the cell cycle and stress responses. Furthermore, 57, 74, 168 and 78 lncRNAs specifically expressed in root tips, shoot tips, young fruits and stem phloem were analyzed using the COG (cluster of orthologous group)and GO (gene ontology) databases. Young fruits contain the most unique lncRNAs, which are involved in biological processes such as energy production and conversion, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, posttranslational modification and protein turnover. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is employed to confirm the different expression levels among the four tissues. Moreover, the expression levels of eight fruit related lncRNAs are investigated during different fruit development stages, which indicates they have important roles in fruit ripening and sugar metabolism. Overall, our genome-wide research on lncRNAs in different apple tissues provides valuable clues and information that can help elucidate the potential roles of lncRNAs in the growth and development of apple, as well as in other fruit trees.

ID INHERITED DEFECTS; GENE; MECHANISM
AB Objective: Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is the major human thyroid hormone transport protein, encoded by the SERPINA7 gene (Xq22.2). We aim to investigate the molecular basis of partial TBG deficiency (TBG-PD) in a female, by evaluating the X-chromosome inactivation pattern as well as the mutant protein structural modeling.
   Design and methods: Sequencing of the coding region of the SERPINA7 gene was performed in a female with a TBG-PD phenotype and her first-degree relatives. The proband presented with low serum levels of total T3 (TT3) and total T4 (TT4), serum TSH level of 5.4 CJI/mL (normal range, 0.35-5.5), and serum TBG level of 5.5 mg/L (normal range, 13.6-27.2). X-chromosome inactivation pattern was evaluated by methylation analysis of the androgen receptor gene (Xq11.2). Structural analysis of the SERPIN family was performed using Pymol and Areaimol, and PFSTATS for conservation analysis and family-wide investigation of equivalent positions in human homologs. Modeller was used for point mutation structural modeling.
   Results: A novel missense SERPINA7 mutation (p.R35W; c.163C > T) was found in heterozygosity in the pro band, and in hemizygosity in her affected siblings. The proband X-chromosome inactivation ratio was 20:80. The substitution of an arginine by a tryptophan is predicted to disrupt the protein surface and main electrostatic interactions. Tryptophans are extremely rare (0.1%) in this position.
   Conclusions: We report a new SERPINA7 variant associated with TBG-PD in three siblings. We named this variant TBG-Brasilia. The X-chromosome inactivation pattern may have accounted for the rare phenotypic expression in a female. The hydrophobic nature of the mutant is predicted to create an apolar patch at the surface, which results in protein aggregation and/or misfolding, potentially responsible for thyroid hormone transport defect.

AB Several of the thousands of human long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been functionally characterized, yet their potential involvement in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) remains poorly understood. In present study, we aim to investigate the role of IncRNA LINC00174 in CRC carcinogenesis. We observed that increased expression of LINC00174 in CRC tissues and cells in comparison to their corresponding controls. Moreover, the aberrant overexpression of LINC00174 indicated the poor prognosis of CRC patients. Silence of LINC00174 was able to repress CRC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We first reported that transcription factor STAT1 mediated LINC00174 expression in CRC. In addition, rescue assay was performed to further confirm that LINC00174 contributed to CRC progression by regulating miR-1910-3p/TAZ signal pathway. Taken together, our study discovered the oncogenic role of LINC00174 in clinical specimens and cellular experiments, showing the potential LINC00174/miR-1910-3p/TAZ pathway. This results and findings provide a novel insight for CRC tumorigenesis.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as important molecular regulators in a wide range of biological processes during plant development and seed formation, including oil production. Tree peony seeds contain > 90% unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) and high proportions of a-linolenic acid (ALA, > 40%). To dissect the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) pathway involved in fatty acids synthesis in tree peony seeds, we construct six small RNA libraries and six transcriptome libraries from developing seeds of two cultivars (J and S) containing different content of fatty acid compositions. After deep sequencing the RNA libraries, the ncRNA expression profiles of tree peony seeds in two cultivars were systematically and comparatively analyzed. A total of 318 known and 153 new miRNAs and 22,430 lncRNAs were identified, among which 106 conserved and 9 novel miRNAs and 2785 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between the two cultivars. In addition, potential target genes of the microRNA and lncRNAs were also predicted and annotated. Among them, 9 miRNAs and 39 lncRNAs were predicted to target lipid related genes. Results showed that all of miR414, miR156b, miR2673b, miR7826, novel-m0027-5p, TR24651 vertical bar c0_gl, TR24544 vertical bar c0_g15, and TR27305 vertical bar c0_g1 were up-regulated and expressed at a higher level in high-ALA cultivar J when compared to low-ALA cultivar S, suggesting that these ncRNAs and target genes are possibly involved in different fatty acid synthesis and lipid metabolism through post-transcriptional regulation. These results provide a better understanding of the roles of ncRNAs during fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism in tree peony seeds.

AB Catalase-peroxidases represent one important subfamily of ancestral antioxidant enzymes originally evolved in bacteria for the protection against various forms of oxidative stress. KatG genes coding for these bifunctional catalase-peroxidases were during their peculiar evolution transferred from Bacteroidetes to the fungal phylum Ascomycota via a horizontal gene transfer event. Here we analyse a newly discovered fungal katG gene without introns coding for a thermostable catalase-peroxidase from Chaetomium thermophilum var. dissitum and compare it with closely related thermophilic and mesophilic katGs and their translation products. We show that CthediskatG gene resembling its bacterial counterparts has a typical eukaryotic transcription start site and also contains a conserved eukaryotic polyadenylation signal behind its 3' terminus. Moreover, we have detected polyA tails in corresponding transcripts of katG from two different mRNA libraries of C. thermophilum var. dis-stum Although otherwise highly conserved, only in katG genes of two C. thermophilum variants a unique 60 bp long deletion leading in the translated product with high probability to a modified loop and thus access to the prosthetic heme group was observed. We also present an updated molecular phylogeny revealing the evolutionary position of fungal thermostable catalase-peroxidases within a robust phylogenetic tree of the whole KatG subfamily.

AB To unveil the possible protective role of isorhamnetin, an immediate 3'-O-methylated metabolite of quercetin, in cardiomyocyte under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) condition and the underlying mechanisms involved, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were exposed to the vehicle or H/R for 6 h (2 h of hypoxia following by 4 h of reoxygenation) with isorhamnetin (0, 3, 6, 12, 25, 50 mu M for 4 h prior to H/R exposure). Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining, flow cytometry analysis and western blot assay for cleaved caspase-3. Myocardial injure in vivo was determined by infarct size using TTC staining, histological damage using H&E staining and myocardial apoptosis. Here, we found that isorhamnetin dose-dependently protected H9c2 cardiomyocytes against H/R-induced injure, as evidenced by the reduction in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, increases in cell viability, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, with the maximal effects at 25 mu M. In addition, isorhamnetin treatment significantly inhibited apoptosis in H/R-induced H9c2 cardiomyocytes and ameliorated H/R-induced myocardial injure in vivo, concomitant with the upregulation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression. Mechanism studies demonstrated that isorhamnetin pretreatment remarkably abolished H/R-induced downregulation of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expressions and upregulation of NADPH oxidase-2/4 (NOX-2/4) expressions in cardiomyocytes. However, SIRT1 inhibition (Sirtinol) not only inhibited isorhamnetin-induced Nrf2/HO-1 upregulation and NOX-2/4 downregulation, but also alleviated its antiapoptotic effects. Taken together, these data indicate that isorhamnetin can exhibit positive effect on H/R-induced injure by attenuating apoptosis and oxidative stress in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, which is partly attributable to the upregulation of SIRT1 and Nrf2/HO-1-mediated antioxidant signaling pathway.

AB Background and aim: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a worldwide leading cause of mortality. Genetic studies have associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding microRNAs with CRC risk but results are mostly inconclusive across variable ethnicities. In this study, we investigated the association of hsa-mir-149 rs2292832 C/T, hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 G/C and hsa-mir-196a2 rs11614913 C/T and explored their roles in dinicopathological features of CRC progression in an Eastern Tunisian cohort.
   Subjects and methods: Three hundred thirteen subjects were enrolled in our retrospective study including 152 CRC cases and 161 controls. Genotyping was assayed by RFLP-PCR (Restriction Fragment Length PolymorphismPolymerase Chain Reaction) method. SPSS v.18.0, R and SNP Stats online software performed statistical analysis.
   Results: Significantly higher hsa-mir-149C/T rs2292832 minor allele frequency was associated with increased risk of CRC [p=.03; OR = 1.54 (1.08-2.19)]. In addition, significant crude associations of hsa-mir-149C/T rs2292832 polymorphism were detected under codominant, dominant and additive models of inheritance. After adjusting for covariates and performing FDR correction, these associations did not remain. No associations were detected for hsa-mir-146a G/C rs2910164 and hsa-mir-196a2 C/T rs11614913. When performing stratified analysis of clinicopathological features according to genotypes, a significant association (p=.004) was found between hsa-mir-146a G/C rs2910164 and tumour differentiation grade. Regression analysis according to CRC progression features had demonstrated a trend toward significance in overdominant model of inheritance for hsa-mir-149C/T rs2292832 with a protective effect [p=.05; OR = 0.51 (0.26-1.02)].
   Conclusion: Hsa-mir-149C/T rs2292832 and hsa-mir-146a G/C rs2910164 may influence CRC risk in an ethnicity -dependent manner by interfering with CRC progression parameters in Tunisian cohort.

AB Hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is becoming an increasingly important vegetable crop in the world. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is a destructive virus that can cause leaf distortion and fruit lesions, affecting pepper production. However, studies on the response to CMV infection in pepper at the transcriptional level are limited. In this study, the transcript profiles of pepper leaves after CMV infection were investigated using Illumina and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). A total of 2143 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at five different stages. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis revealed that these DEGs were involved in the response to stress, defense response and plant-pathogen interaction pathways. Among these DEGs, several key genes that consistently appeared in studies of plant-pathogen interactions had increased transcript abundance after inoculation, including chitinase, pathogenesis-related (PR) protein, TMV resistance protein, WRKY transcription factor and jasmonate ZIM-domain protein. Four of these DEGs were further validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, a total of 73, 597 alternative splicing (AS) events were identified in the pepper leaves after CMV infection, distributed in 12, 615 genes. The intron retention of WRKY33 (Capana09g001251) might be involved in the regulation of CMV infection. Taken together, our study provides a transcriptome-wide insight into the molecular basis of resistance to CMV infection in pepper leaves and potential candidate genes for improving resistance cultivars.

AB As a well-conserved microRNA, miR-183 is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cells including backfat and the 3T3-L1 adipocytes; however, the mechanisms regulating miR-183 in adipogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the expression pattern and role of miR-183 in adipogenesis using hircine pre-adipocytes. The results showed that miR-183 was up-regulated during preadipocyte differentiation, and over expression of miR-183 enhanced lipid accumulation and dramatically increased the mRNA expression of the adipogenic genes PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC. Using bioinformatics tools, we predicted Smad4 to be a target of miR-183. This was subsequently validated with a luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of miR-183 suppressed the mRNA and protein levels of Smad4 significantly, whereas inhibiting miR-183 had the opposite effect. However, inhibition of Smad4 greatly accelerated lipid deposition and increased the expression of adipogenic genes which consists with the results of miR-183 overexpression. In conclusion, these results indicate that miR-183 promotes hircine preadipocyte differentiation by targeting Smad4.

AB In this study, the nodal thermodynamic and dynamic analysis of an alpha type Stirling engine driven by Scotchyoke mechanism is presented. The nodal thermodynamic section of the analysis is performed via 15 nodal volumes. The temperature variations in nodal volumes are calculated by means of the first law of the thermodynamics given for the open systems. The pressures in all of the nodal volumes are assumed to be equal and calculated via Schmidt relation. The momentary masses in nodal volumes are calculated via the perfect gas relation. The dynamic section of the analysis involves the motion equations of pistons and crankshaft. The motion equations are derived by means of the Newton method. In the derivation of the motion equations of pistons, the working fluid forces and friction forces are considered beside the inertia forces. In the derivation of motion equation of the crankshaft, moments of working fluid forces, moments of friction forces, the moment of external load and the moment of starter motor are considered as well as mass inertia moments. It is estimated that an engine having 1.8 L swept volume, 1000 K hot end temperature, 400 K cold end temperature, 3000 cm(2) total inner heat transfer area, 5.1 bar charge pressure and 2000 W/m(2) K inner heat transfer coefficient is capable of producing a shaft power above 2 kW. For these inputs and shaft power; the speed, speed fluctuation and torque are optimized as 138 rad/s, 16% and 14.9 N m respectively. The presented analysis is useful for engine development studies.

AB Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have received growing interest for off-shore application and in the urban environments mainly due to their omni-directional capability, scalability, robustness, low noise and costs. However, their aerodynamic performance is still not comparable with their horizontal axis counterparts. To enhance their performance, the impact of operational parameters such as tip speed ratio (lambda), Reynolds number (Re-c) and turbulence intensity (TI) on their power performance and aerodynamics needs to be deeply understood. The current study, therefore, intends to systematically investigate the effect of these parameters in order to provide a deeper insight into their impact on the aerodynamic performance of VAWTs. For this investigation, a Darrieus H-type VAWT has been employed. A wide range of the parameters is considered: lambda = 1.2-6.0, Re-c = 0.3 x 10(5)-4.2 x 10(5) and TI = 0%-30% to analyze the turbine performance, turbine wake and dynamic loads on blades. High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD), extensively validated with experimental data, are employed. The results show that (i) variable-speed operation maintaining the optimal lambda at different wind speeds improves the turbine power coefficient, e.g. up to 168% at 4 m/s, while keeping an almost constant thrust coefficient, (ii) the turbine performance and wake are Re-dependent up to the highest Re-c studied, (iii) large TI (> 5%) improves the turbine performance in dynamic stall by promoting the laminar-to-turbulent transition and delaying stall on blades, however it deteriorates the optimal performance by introducing extra skin friction drag. The findings of the current study can support more accurate performance prediction of VAWTs for various operating conditions and can help the improvement of the aerodynamic performance of VAWTs.

AB We introduce a reusable energy harvesting system that can recover discarded thermal energy by utilizing temperature variation of the environment. The system consists of two different phase change materials (PCMs); poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and 1-tetradecanol (1-TD), and a cell of N and P type semiconductor. Since a large amount of heat energy is absorbed during phase transition, PCMS are generally utilized to maintain isothermal temperature on the opposite sides of the N and P type semiconductor as long as possible. The resulting temperature difference between two sides of semiconductor induces an electric current during the heating and cooling process. It is important for the phase change material (PCM) to possess a good shape stability without significant loss of latent heat. A 3D porous graphene aerogel is selected for the pure phase change material to infiltrate into the aerogel and to increase the shape stability and thermal conductivity of the PCM composite. The thermal conductivity of PEG and 1-TD composites is significantly increased to 0.4268 W/m.K, and 0.3408 W/mK, respectively. Thermal and electrical analyses are performed to predict the energy harvested by the device. The electrical energy is generated in the harvesting system due to the Seebeck effect. The maximum value of the electric current reaches 10 mA in both heating and cooling processes and an LED lamp was turned on successfully. Additionally, the energy harvesting system is modelled by using the finite element method (FEM) and the numerical prediction is in good agreement with the experimental results.

AB For a vehicle engine, it usually operates under transient conditions, and the transient behaviors represent its actual performance. In order to improve the actual performance of GDI engine during vehicle driving cycles, the vehicle test was conducted under new European driving cycle (NEDC), and the thermodynamics, combustion and emission characteristics were tested. Then, the transient performance of GDI engine was compared with the steady-state behaviors. In this way, the differences in various performance parameters under NEDC and steady-state conditions were demonstrated, and the reasons were revealed. Results show that, the spark timing, start of combustion (SOC), ignition delay, 50% combustion location and 10-90% combustion duration of GDI engine under NEDC deviate from their steady-state values seriously especially at low load, resulting in the large combustion instability. The consistency of pumping mean effective pressure (PMEP) under NEDC and steadystate conditions is satisfactory, while the indicated thermal efficiency has a large fluctuation during NEDC, and in most cases it is lower than the steady-state values. Both the transient HC and CO emissions are larger than the steady-state values especially at low load, while the transient NOx emission during NEDC is less than the steadystate values. All those not only demonstrated the change rules of combustion and emission characteristics of GDI engine under NEDC, but also provided guidance for improving the actual performance of vehicle engine.

AB This paper presents the geological resource potential of the compressed air energy storage (CAES) technology worldwide by overlaying suitable geological formations, salt deposits and aquifers. For this study, the world is divided into 145 regions, which are aggregated to 9 major regions. The potential of CAES in each region is assessed and a relevant map is provided. Three constraints have been implemented, allowing for 1%, 5% and 10% of the selected area to be considered for CAES. Among all major regions, in the most conservative constraint (1% of the total area), North America is the leader with 0.26% suitability of its total area, followed by SubSaharan Africa and South America at 0.20% and 0.19%, respectively. A sensitivity analysis is implemented to evaluate the validity and reliability of the results. Three scenarios are considered: Optimistic, Moderate and Pessimistic. Underground natural gas storage data for the US is used due to freely and publicly available data. The natural gas storage site is assumed to have the same structure as CAES. The sensitivity analysis shows that the accuracy of the findings lie in the range of 66-85% and 63-82%, depending on the scenarios and reservoir types. The results clearly reveal that CAES is a promising energy storage technology for electricity supply in most of the regions. This research presents the groundwork to identify the untapped potential of CAES, which can be also utilized for the second generation of CAES such as adiabatic CAES and isothermal CAES.

AB This paper introduces the scientific part of a large-scale study in the Upper Peninsula (U.P.) of Michigan, a historical mining area, for exploring the water in deep abandoned copper mines as a geothermal energy resource. The main focus of the paper is placed on the scientific understanding of the natural mine water-geologic formation system, especially the transport of heat and mass in this large-scale natural system, which is critical to the efficiency and sustainability of the energy renovation. For this purpose, a field study involving measurements of temperatures and chemicals in a local mine shaft in the U.P. is conducted to reveal the major issue in recovering geothermal energy in the water from the shaft, i.e., the temperature distribution. Water samples are also collected in situ to investigate the distribution and concentrations of major chemicals. Afterward, a theoretical framework for the thermo-hydrodynamic process in the mine water coupled with heat transfer in the surrounding geologic formations is developed to outline a mathematical description for studying the scientific issue. Simulations are finally conducted, based on the real geologic information, to preliminarily investigate the quasi-equilibrium water movement in this local mine shaft due to geothermal gradients to provide insights into the phenomena observed in the field study.

AB The demand of compactness and light-weight for thermoelectric applications requires optimized system integration of thermoelectric module and heat sinks to achieve the best performance under size and weight constraints. This work studies the thermal resistance matching (i.e., optimal thermal resistance allocation of thermoelectric module and heat sinks) for real thermoelectric cooling systems via an integrated theoretical and experimental method. A theoretical model is first developed to study the relationship of thermal resistance allocation and the system cooling power under different operating currents. Modeling results indicate that the optimal thermal resistance of thermoelectric module should account for 40-70% of the total thermal resistance. The effectiveness of thermal resistance matching is then demonstrated in the selection of an optimal thermoelectric module among 73 off-the-shelf modules to develop a portable thermoelectric cooling system. By comparing the cooling performance of two thermoelectric cooling systems with and without thermal resistance matching, it is experimentally demonstrated that the system with thermal resistance matching achieved 10.7-19.8% larger cooling power under the same size and weight constraints. This can be used as a guideline for optimal design of thermoelectric cooling systems.

AB In this paper, the study investigates the combined application of water additive and metal-based additive in the biodiesel-diesel blend fuel. Varied mixtures of biodiesel- diesel (B5), water (i.e. 2%, 4% and 6% wt.) and cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles (90 ppm) components are compared with pure diesel in terms of their combustion emissions and performance. The experiments are carried out on a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The results showed that the water additive in the biodiesel-diesel fuel was beneficial to improving the mixing of air and fuel due to the micro-explosion. Nevertheless, by further increasing water additive to 6%, the effect of micro-explosion would be dominated by the impact of increased viscosity leading to combustion deterioration. Proper water additive is beneficial to improving performance and decreasing the CO, PM, NOx and HC emissions. As well as the metal-based additives in the blend fuels can further improve the overall combustion quality and decrease the emissions. More specifically, the metal-based additives are beneficial to improving the brake power and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and decreasing the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and emissions due to the improved combustion caused by the catalytic activity during the combustion process. Thus, the relationship between the additives and performance and emission characteristics of blend fuel is very important.

The semiconductor material used in the simulation is bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) and copper (Cu) is used to achieve the electrical contact between the TE pillars. Two geometries of the thermocouple legs are studied, cubic and cylindrical geometries, revealing that both present identical performances under the same conditions. From these simulations, the optimal ratios achieved between the various geometrical parameters of the TC's are analysed. It was verified that it exists an optimal ratio between the height and the width of the TE legs with the value 5 x 10(-3). Moreover, it is shown that increasing the cross-section area of the legs enhances the power produced by a TC. It was also observed that the length of the copper contacts should be smaller than 0.05 times the width of the IT legs for the best performance to be achieved. It was also established that there is an optimal ratio between the copper contacts height and the IT legs height, being, approximately, 40. For a TE device, an increase in the number of TC's is favourable towards a better performance.

AB This paper investigates the integration of conventional and renewable energy sources and its impact over the power system generation scheduling. The multi-objective optimization framework is implemented for the economic emission scheduling of the pumped storage hydrothermal (PSHT) system incorporating solar units. The heuristic optimization technique named as crisscross search particle swarm optimization (CSPSO) has been implemented to solve the scheduling problem. In the heuristic approach, an initial solution has been updated by the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) approach and then local best solutions are updated by using horizontal and vertical crossover operators. The horizontal crossover operator is applied to enhance the search capability and the vertical crossover operation is implemented to mitigate the dimensional stagnancy problem. The improved binary PSO is applied to update the discrete binary variables. The cardinal priority method is used to search most satisfying the non dominated solution. In order to validate the performance of CSPSO, it has been applied to minimize cost and pollutant emission of the standard hydrothermal system and PSHT system incorporating solar units. The obtained results have been compared with the reported results in the literature and found satisfactory. More specifically, it has been observed from the results of test system-I and II that inclusion of pumped storage unit (PSU) and solar power generation is able to decrease the cost by 3.87% and 6.79%, respectively and emission by 22.01% and 23.69%, respectively. Further, the mutual impact of solar power and the PSU is able to decrease the cost and emission by 10.27% and 39.74%, respectively. The statistical test has been performed to validate the robustness of the optimization technique.

AB This paper aims to enhance through two-dimensional numerical CFD simulations the hydrodynamic performance of a low cut-in speed current Vertical Axis Tidal Turbine (VATT) by means of the nested hybridization of Savonius and Darrieus. In fact, the hybrid turbine offers several coupling scenarios. In this work, the nested coupling has been used for Darrieus and Savonius to design the hybrid turbine model. Moreover, the effect of the rotational velocities of Savonius and Darrieus turbines, weather synchronized/desynchronized, identical/inverse rotational direction of the assessed rotors has been investigated.
   OpenFoam code was used to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the nested hybrid turbines, and to investigate their torque and power coefficients. This code is based on an Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stocks (URANS) approach coupled with k-omega Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model. URANS models were validated against the literature results by performing 2D simulations on Savonius and Darrieus wind turbines. Therefore, the turbine's behavior was studied and the overall performance efficiency of the nested hybrid design was enhanced over a defined Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) range. The main founding of this study was that the hybrid asynchronous coupling of Savonius and Darrieus (Identical rotational direction for the two rotors) is providing the effective performances compared to the other hybrid studied configurations.

AB Nowadays, different renewable sources and energy storages are attracting world attention due to the major concerns about the excessive emissions and the global energy crisis. Hence, this paper studies design and performance investigation of a biogas fueled building cooling and power system, which comprises of an air compressor, an air preheater, a combustion chamber, a gas turbine, some compression chillers and aggregated plugin electric vehicles. In the proposed coproduction facility, biogas is used as an alternative fuel to reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions and increase the economic saving in the consumption of fossil fuels. The feasibility and robust performance of this microgrid is evaluated under extremely-hot summer days. Three compression chillers are installed to satisfy total cooling demand of a large hotel building located in Ahwaz, Iran. Moreover, the total energy requirement of chillers and building electricity demand is supplied through the biogas driven gas turbine cycle. A mid-high temperature waste heat is recovered from the exhaust gases of gas turbine to be used in the air preheating stage. A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis is developed to solve a mixed integer non-linear programming problem with the aim of minimizing total electricity procurement cost of the proposed zero-emission cogeneration micro-plant taking into account the operational constraints of gas turbine cycle, compression chillers, and electric drive vehicles.

AB This article concentrates on the ash deposit formation during the combustion of pulverized grape pomace in a drop tube furnace. All experiments were conducted for a wall drop tube furnace temperature of 1200 degrees C. Initially, axial measurements of temperature, major gas species concentrations and particle burnout were obtained for a representative drop tube furnace operating condition. These measurements allowed to establish the drop tube furnace axial position to place a deposition probe, fitted with a removable stainless steel capsule, to study the ash deposit formation. Subsequently, detailed data on ash deposit formation rates were obtained for seven probe exposition times between 2 and 14 h. Finally, deposit samples for all exposition times were analysed on a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray detector. Important distinct features of the present study include the examination of the temporal evolution of the deposit characteristics, such as their sintering degree, which is critical to assess the need for boiler cleaning, and the method of analysis of the deposits chemical composition. It is concluded that the sintering degree of the deposits increased with the probe exposition time and for exposition times above 8 h, the deposits are very difficult to remove. It is also observed that the impact of the probe exposition time in the concentrations of potassium, phosphorus and magnesium is marginal, and that the oxygen concentration decreases as the probe exposition time increases, while the opposite behavior is observed for calcium and silicon. Overall, the results reveal that the use of this biomass residue in industrial combustion systems may pose severe operational and maintenance problems, requiring frequent boiler cleaning.

AB In this study, an efficient optimization framework is presented for the simultaneous planning of energy production and maintenance in combined heat and power plants, and applied in the largest coal-fired cogeneration plant of Kazakhstan. In brief, the proposed optimization model considers: (i) unit commitment constraints for boilers and turbines; (ii) minimum and maximum runtimes as well as minimum idle times for boilers and turbines; (iii) bounds on the operating levels for boilers and turbines within desired operating regions; (iv) extreme operating regions for turbines; (v) energy balances for turbines; (vi) total electricity and heat balances for satisfying the corresponding demands for electricity and heat (for each heat network); and (vii) maintenance tasks for units that must occur within given flexible time-windows. The minimization of the annual total cost of the cogeneration plant constitutes the optimization goal here, and consists of startup and shutdown costs, fixed operating and fuel costs, maintenance costs, and penalties for deviation from heat and electricity demands, and penalties for turbines for operating outside the desired operating regions. An extensive data analysis of historical data has been performed to extract the necessary input data. In comparison to the implemented industrial solution that follows a predefined maintenance policy, the solutions derived by the proposed approach achieve reductions in annual total cost more than 21% and completely avoid turbines operation outside their desired operating regions. Our solutions report substantial reductions in startup/shutdown, fuel and fixed operating costs (about 85%, 15%, and 13%, respectively). The comparative case study clearly demonstrates that the proposed approach is an effective means for generating optimal energy production and maintenance plans, enhancing significantly the resource and energy efficiency of the plant. Importantly, the proposed optimization framework could be readily applied to other cogeneration plants that have a similar plant structure.

AB Intelligent agents are often used in professional portfolio management. The use of intelligent agents in personal retirement portfolio management is not investigated in the past. In this research, we consider a two-asset personal retirement portfolio and propose several reinforcement learning agents for trading portfolio assets. In particular, we design an on-policy SARSA (lambda) and an off-policy Q(lambda) discrete state and discrete action agents that maximize either portfolio returns or differential Sharpe ratios. Additionally, we design a temporal-difference learning, TD(lambda), agent that uses a linear valuation function in discrete state and continuous action settings. Using two different two-asset portfolios, the first asset being the S&P 500 Index and the second asset being either a broad bond market index or a 10-year U.S. Treasury note (T-note), we test the performance of different agents on different holdout (test) samples. The results of our experiments indicate that the high-learning frequency (i.e., adaptive learning) TD(lambda) agent consistently beats both the single asset stock and bond cumulative returns by a significant margin.

AB Volatility plays crucial roles in financial markets, such as in derivative pricing, portfolio risk management, and hedging strategies. Therefore, accurate prediction of volatility is critical. We propose a new hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) model to forecast stock price volatility that combines the LSTM model with various generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)-type models. We use KOSPI 200 index data to discover proposed hybrid models that combine an LSTM with one to three GARCH-type models. In addition, we compare their performance with existing methodologies by analyzing single models, such as the GARCH, exponential GARCH, exponentially weighted moving average, a deep feedforward neural network (DFN), and the LSTM, as well as the hybrid DFN models combining a DFN with one GARCH-type model. Their performance is compared with that of the proposed hybrid LSTM models. We discover that GEW-LSTM, a proposed hybrid model combining the LSTM model with three GARCH-type models, has the lowest prediction errors in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), heteroscedasticity adjusted MAE (HMAE), and heteroscedasticity adjusted MSE (HMSE). The MAE of GEW-ISTM is 0.0107, which is 37.2% less than that of the E-DFN (0.017), the model combining EGARCH and DFN and the best model among those existing. In addition, the GEW-LSTM has 57.3%, 24.7%, and 48% smaller MSE, HMAE, and HMSE, respectively. The first contribution of this study is its hybrid LSTM model that combines excellent sequential pattern learning with improved prediction performance In stock market volatility. Second, our proposed model markedly enhances prediction performance of the existing literature by combining a neural network model with multiple econometric models rather than only a single econometric model. Finally, the proposed methodology can be extended to various fields as an integrated model combining time-series and neural network models as well as forecasting stock market volatility.

AB Traditional topic modeling has been widely studied and popularly employed in expert systems and information systems. However, traditional topic models cannot discover structural relations among topics, thus losing the chance to explore the data more deeply. Hierarchical topic modeling has the capability of learning topics, as well as discovering the hierarchical topic structure from text data. But purely unsupervised models tend to generate weak topic hierarchies. To solve this problem, we propose a novel knowledge-based hierarchical topic model (KHTM), which can incorporate prior knowledge into topic hierarchy building. A key novelty of this model is that it can mine prior knowledge automatically from the topic hierarchies of multiple domains corpora. In this paper, the knowledge is represented as the word pairs which satisfy the requirement of frequent co-occurrence, and knowledge is organized in form of hierarchical structure. We also propose an iterative learning algorithm. For evaluation, we crawled two new multi-domain datasets and conducted comprehensive experiments. The experimental results show that our algorithm and model can generate more coherent topics, and more reasonable hierarchical structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban travel time estimation is of significant importance at many levels of traffic operation and transportation management. This paper develops a tensor-based context-aware approach to dynamically provide personalized travel time estimation from a citywide perspective, using sparse and large-scale GPS trajectories. This novel model is comprised of four major components: map matching, travel time tensor construction, context-aware feature extraction, and travel time tensor factorization. First, GPS trajectories are map-matched onto the road network. Then, travel times of different drivers on different road segments in different time slots are modeled with a 3-order tensor. Following these, three categories of context features, i.e., historical, geographical and spatial-temporal features, are extracted to capture the contextual information of travel time and traffic condition in the road network. Finally, an objective function is devised to factorize travel time tensors with context features collaboratively. In addition, a gradient-based algorithm is developed to find an optimal solution for the context-aware estimation model. The novel model incorporates both the spatial correlation between different road segments and the deviation between different drivers, as well as the fine-grain temporal correlation between different time slots and the coarse-grain temporal correlation between recent and historical traffic conditions. The proposed model is applied in a real case on the urban road network of Beijing, China, based on the sparse and large-scale GPS trajectories collected from over 32,000 drivers in a period of 2 months. Empirical results on extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model provides an effective and robust approach for citywide personalized travel time estimation, and outperforms the competing methods.

AB Reverse logistics initiatives with social commerce not only provide opportunities for firms to create new sources of revenue but also demonstrate their corporate social responsibility via social, green, and environmental activities. Thus, a growing number of companies are attempting to streamline their social commerce platforms to effectively handle reverse logistics. The purpose of this study is to identify the criteria that should be used in designing and evaluating social commerce based reverse logistics processes by firms. We tested the effectiveness of the identified criteria by using them to evaluate the reverse logistics practices of three major global firms that use social commerce platforms. First, we identified the criteria from a thorough review of the literature. Then, we invited five experts to provide (linguistic) ratings of these firms on the selected criteria, using a fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique with FLINTSTONES (a software tool) to generate aggregate scores for the assessment and evaluation of reverse logistics practices in social commerce platforms. Sensitivity analysis was also provided to monitor the robustness of the approach. The results of the study identified that four dominant criteria (reverse logistics performance indicators) in the social commerce platform: Customer relationship, Usage risk, Reviews, and Quality control.

TI Gesture recognition: A review focusing on sign language in a mobile
   context
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Review
DE Gesture recognition; Sign language; Mobile devices
ID TRANSFORM; PCA
AB Sign languages, which consist of a combination of hand movements and facial expressions, are used by deaf persons around the world to communicate. However, hearing persons rarely know sign languages, creating barriers to inclusion. The increasing progress of mobile technology, along with new forms of user interaction, opens up possibilities for overcoming such barriers, particularly through the use of gesture recognition through smartphones. This Literature Review discusses works from 2009 to 2017 that present solutions for gesture recognition in a mobile context as well as facial recognition in sign languages. Among a diversity of hardware and techniques, sensor-based gloves were the most used special hardware, along with brute force comparison to classify gestures. Works that did not adopt special hardware mostly used skin color for feature extraction in gesture recognition. Classification algorithms included: Support Vector Machines, Hierarchical Temporal Memory and Feedforward backpropagation neural network, among others. Recognition of static gestures typically achieved results higher than 80%. Fewer papers recognized dynamic gestures, obtaining results above 90%. However, most experiments were performed under controlled environments, with specific lighting conditions, and were only using a small set of gestures. In addition, the majority of works dealt with a simple background and used special hardware (which is often cumbersome for the user) to facilitate feature extraction. Facial expression recognition achieved high classification results using Random-Forest and Multi-layer Perceptron. Despite the progress being made with the increasing interest in gesture recognition, there are still important gaps to be addressed in the context of sign languages. Besides improving usability and efficacy of the solutions, recognition of facial expression and of both static and dynamic gestures in complex backgrounds must be considered. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Banana flour has been recognized as functional ingredient, owing to its healthy nutritional pattern. Nevertheless, unripe and ripe banana flours show different characteristics and scarce information is available about changes undergone during banana ripening. This study evaluates the changes on physiochemical (chemical composition, hydration properties, rheological properties and structural characteristic) and nutritional (resistant starch content, phenolic compound and antioxidant activity) characteristics of banana flour at the initial four ripening stages. The significant increase in protein content and decrease in carbohydrate and apparent amylose content, besides the reduction in pasting properties, between 2nd and 3rd stages suggested a climacteric peak during ripening. Between those stages, a significant decrease in total and resistant starch was produced together with an increase in total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Therefore, the knowledge of the physicochemical and nutritional characteristics of banana flour at each ripening stage allows better selection depending on the industrial application.

AB The post-mortem accumulation of the heme biosynthesis metabolite zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) in porcine muscle is associated with both a meat-inherent and a bacterial enzymatic reaction during meat storage. To estimate the bacterial impact on ZnPP formation, meat and meat-like media were investigated by HPLC-FLD (and MALDI-TOF-MS) after inoculation with a representative microorganism (P. fluorescens). Results indicate the principal ability of meat-inherent bacteria to form ZnPP in meat extracts and meat-like media, but not on the meat muscle. Thus it was concluded that the ZnPP formation in meat is due to a meat-inherent enzymatic reaction induced by porcine ferrochelatase (FECH), while the bacterial (FECH) induced reaction seems to be not significant.

AB This study investigated characteristics of recombinant wheat Endoplasmic Reticulum Oxidoreductin 1 (wEro1) and its influence on Chinese steamed bread (CSB) qualities. The purified wEro1 monomer, which contained two conserved redox active motif sites, bound to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor with a molecular weight of similar to 47 kDa. wEro1 catalyzed the reduction of both bound and free FAD, and its reduction activity of free FAD reached 7.8U/mg. Moreover, wEro1 catalyzed the oxidation of dithiothreitol and wheat protein disulfide isomerase (wPDI). Both glutathione and the reduced ribonuclease could work as electron donors for wEro1 in catalyzing the oxidation of wPDI. Additionally, wEro1 supplementation improved the CSB qualities with an increased specific volume of CSB and decreased crumb hardness, which was attributed to water-insoluble wheat proteins increasing and gluten network strengthening. The results give an understanding of the properties and function of wEro1 to facilitate its application especially in the flour-processing industry.

AB Propyl gallate (PG), one of the most widely used synthetic phenolic antioxidants in edible oil, cookies and fried food, has received extensive concern due to its possible toxic effects on human health. Herein, a novel fluorescence analytical method is firstly proposed to sensitively and selectively determine propyl gallate (PG) by utilizing the unique fluorescence quenching property of organic molybdate complex (OMC) formed by the specific reaction between MoO42- and PG to g-C3N4 nanosheets. Under the optimum conditions, the developed fluorescence sensor allows highly sensitive detection of PG in a wide range from 0.5 to 200 mu g mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.11 mu g mL(-1), and possesses excellent specificity and good recoveries. All the analytical results indicate the present method provides an effective approach for rapid detection of PG in common products, which is beneficial for monitoring and reducing the risk of overuse of PG.

AB An optimized and validated LC-ESI-QTOF-MS method with an integrated non-target screening workflow was applied in the investigation of the metabolomic profile of 51 Greek monovarietal extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) from the varieties: Manaki, Ladoelia, Koroneiki, Amfissis, Chalkidikis and Kolovi. Data processing was carried out with the R language and XCMS package. A local database consisting of 1608 compounds naturally occurring in different organs of Olea Europa L. was compiled in order to accelerate the identification workflow. The preliminary examination of the distribution of EVOOs toward their cultivars was achieved by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Ant Colony Optimization-Random Forest (ACO-RF) was developed to prioritize over 250 features and to establish a classification tree. Apigenin, vanillic acid, luteolin 7-methyl ether and oleocanthal were suggested as the markers responsible for the classification of Greek EVOOs' cultivars.

AB Fe2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+ are enzyme cofactors in terpenoids biosynthesis. Effects of pre-harvest spray of FeSO4, MgSO4 and MnSO4 (0.2% and 0.3%) 30 d prior to harvest on the levels of terpenoids and phenolic compounds in ripe mango fruit were investigated. All treatments significantly increased lupeol in the peel compared to control and it was highest in pulp of 0.3% FeSO4-treated fruit. Spray of each nutrient (0.3%) increased total carotenoids in the pulp. Mangiferin in pulp was significantly higher in the fruit treated with 0.2% FeSO4, MgSO4 and MnSO4 compared to control and 0.3%. Concentrations of gallic, ferulic and caffeic acids in the peel and chlorogenic acid in pulp and peel were highest in fruit sprayed with 0.2% FeSO4. In conclusion, pre-harvest spray of FeSO4, MgSO4 and MnSO4 regulates concentrations of terpenoids and phenolic compounds in the pulp and peel of ripe mango fruit.

AB To develop resistant starch (RS) nanoparticles, waxy rice starch was hydrolyzed with acid for 10 days, and acid-hydrolyzed waxy rice starch (AHW) was cross-linked with sodium trimetaphosphate. The RS nanoparticles were collected by freeze-drying (FD), freeze-drying after sonication (SFD), and ethanol dehydration after sonication (SE). The particle size distribution, RS level by modified AOAC, zeta potential, and stability of dispersion were assessed. The hydrolysis rate ranged from 44.62% to 49.43%, and AHW particle size decreased as hydrolysis time increased. All AHW and RS nanoparticles showed A type crystallinity. The particle size and zeta potential of the nanoparticles dried by FD, SFD, and SE were 300.0, 211.9, and 459.7 nm and -37.1, -43.0, and -35.4 mV, respectively. The RS levels were increased by cross-linking. The SFD dispersion was the most stable. The results indicate that the RS4 nanoparticles, for applying to liquid foods, can be prepared by acid hydrolysis, cross-linking, and SFD.

AB Bromelain, a cysteine endopeptidase enzyme of great commercial value, has been widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Conventional methods for purification of bromelain are still limited by a low binding efficiency, time-consuming process, and expensive equipment. Therefore, for selective absorption of bromelain, we developed a facile and effective method to fabricate magnetic mesoporous molecularly imprinted polymers using pericarpium granati-derived carbon as the carrier for the first time. The characterizations of the imprinted polymers indicated that a polydopamine layer was coated on the surface of the carrier and the crystallinity of the carrier did not change. The obtained imprinted polymers exhibited favourable saturation magnetization, a high adsorption capacity of 135.96 mg g(-1), a fast equilibrium time, and satisfactory reusability. The imprinted polymers were prepared by an eco-friendly method and exhibited rapid separation and good adsorption performance, thus making the method applicable to biomacromolecular separation, proteomic analysis, and biomedical research.

AB Various bioactive peptides are continuously being identified from casein hydrolysates. In this work, a novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACEI) peptide, NMAINPSKENLCSTFCK, derived from the alpha(s2)-casein fragment residues 25-41, was screened and identified by UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS from tryptic casein hydrolysate. The IC50 value of the peptide, determined by an HPLC method, was 129.07 mu M. The Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that this peptide acted as a mixed-type inhibitor against ACE, which might be attributed to the peptide being susceptible to degradation by ACE, indicating that the mixed-type inhibition could partly be a result of newly generated peptide fragments. The physicochemical characteristics and the secondary structure were evaluated by circular dichroism analysis and online prediction software (Expasy, PepDraw, and ProtParam) to identify the basic characteristics of this peptide. Moreover, molecular docking was simulated by Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software to provide the potential mechanisms underlying the ACEI activity of the peptides.

AB Type I photo-oxidation generates Trp-(TrpN center dot) and Tyr-derived (TyrO center dot) radicals in proteins which can dimerize producing cross-links, or alternatively react with O-2. It was therefore hypothesized that the O-2 concentration may have a significant effect on dye-photosensitized reactions. We studied photo-oxidation of alpha- and beta-caseins induced by riboflavin (RF), a photosensitizing vitamin present in milk, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Triplet-state RF induced oxidative modifications on both caseins, and significant levels of cross-links. The extent of damage, and the yield of cross-links versus oxidized products, was dependent on the O-2 concentration. In the absence of O-2, the overall extent of damage was decreased, but the yield of cross-linked products was significantly elevated. These cross-links are consistent with inter- and intra-molecular di-Tyr or di-Trp bridges. Alternative cross-links were detected in the presence of O-2, consistent with pathways involving the reaction of protein radicals with O-2 or O-2(center dot-).

AB Determination of the oligosaccharide composition in different wort samples is important to monitor their change during the brewing process with different yeast types. In our work, the concentration of fermentable and non-fermentable sugars were monitored by capillary electrophoresis to observe the effect of two different types of yeasts, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomycodes ludwigii. The former first ferments the monosaccharides, then the higher sugar oligomers, such as maltose and maltotriose, to ethanol, while the latter fully ferments the monosaccharides, but ferments only very low percentages of the oligosaccharides. Therefore, breweries use Saccharomycodes ludwigii to produce beers with low alcohol content. The CE-LIF traces of the wort samples represented unique oligosaccharide signatures.

AB Betanin is a red food pigment with health beneficial effects. Despite interest in the use of betanin, low bioaccessibility and oxidation limit its application. To overcome these restrictions, the betanin was loaded in liposomal nanocarriers with the encapsulation efficiency of 80.35 +/- 1%. To assess the efficiency of these nanocarriers, gummy candy was selected as a food model and its nutritional properties such as betanin stability and antioxidant activity were probed. The results showed that the betanin content and antioxidant activity of samples containing betanin-nanoliposomes were at least twice to those of samples containing free betanin. The tests show no differences in the sensory parameters of panelists for gummy candies fortified by betanin-loaded nanoliposomes compared to those fortified by betanin alone. As a result, the liposomal nanoparticles may be introduced as a suitable platform to stabilize and increase the bioavailability of betanin for applications in nutraceutical and medical fields.

AB Phenolic acid composition and activities of two associated enzymes such as PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) and CW-PRX (cell wall peroxidase) in brown rice (BR) were examined during a germination for 4 days. Shoot and kernel fractions of the germinated brown rice were separated, and soluble extracts and insoluble residues of the fractions were analyzed. In the shoot fraction, the PAL activity and soluble phenolic acid content reached to its maximum on the second day of atmospheric germination, and decreased thereafter. In contrast, the amount of insoluble phenolic acids and CW-PRX activity continuously increased during the germination for 4 days. Comparing the shoot fractions, the kernel fraction exhibited lower activities of PAL and CW-PRX, but showed an increase in total phenolic acid content during germination. Germination raised the antioxidant activity of brown rice, especially in the shoot fraction which contained more phenolic acids than the kernel fraction.

AB Lutein, a xanthophyll, is associated to decreased risk of age-related macular degeneration, atherosclerosis and other diseases (Bovier et al., 2013; El-raey, Ibrahim, & Eldahshan, 2013). When lutein is extracted, it becomes highly unstable, reducing its functionality as an antioxidant. The aim of this research was to improve the stability of lutein using maltodextrin, arabic gum and a modified starch, to obtain micro-particles using spray-drying. Each of the formulations was characterized in terms of yield, encapsulation efficiency, particle size distribution, water activity and moisture content.
   The formulations with arabic gum (100%) and arabic gum: maltodextrin: modified starch (33.3:33.3:33.3%), with encapsulation efficiencies of 91.94 +/- 6.88 and 65.72 +/- 0.93%, respectively, were selected to study stability at 45 degrees C and 75% RH (relative humidity). Based on our results, encapsulation could be considered as an alternative for the generation of high value-added functional ingredients that can be used in different industries.

AB To develop an efficient method for degradation of grape seed and skin proanthocyanidins polymers into oligomers, an optimized sulphurous acid degradation conditions for grape seed with the temperature of 60 degrees C, reaction time of 60 min and sample-sulphurous acid ratio of 1:0.2, and for grape skin with the temperature of 40 degrees C, reaction time of 60 min and sample-sulphurous acid ratio of 1:0.2, were established. Afterwards, HSCCC and prep-HPLC were used to fractionate and isolate individual proanthocyanidin oligomers from the degradation products. Total of ten dimeric or trimeric procyanidins were obtained, and most of them presented high yield (from 0.7 mg to 13.6 mg per run in grape seed and from 0.5 mg to 4.1 mg per run in grape skin) and high purity (over 90%). The proposed method provides a new way for large preparation of oligomeric proanthocyanidins from naturally abundant and wasted polymeric ones.

AB A novel ultrasound-assisted surfactant-enhanced emulsification microextraction (UASEME) using a magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) coupled with micro-solid phase extraction was developed for the preconcentration of cadmium and lead in edible vegetable oils prior to analysis by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. MIL [C(4)mim] [FeCl4] was used as the extractant, non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 as the emulsifier and Fe3O4 nanoparticles as the sorbent, while ultrasound was applied to assist the dispersion of the extractant and accelerate the mass transfer process. By mixing Fe3O4 nanoparticles with the MIL after UASEME, the phase separation time was shortened and the separation can be simplified by applying an external magnetic field. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed method was validated and the results demonstrated that the method can produce satisfactory linearity, sensitivity, reproducibility and recovery for the analytes. Finally, the method was successfully applied for the determination of Cd and Pb in edible vegetable oil samples.

AB A protease from tamarillo fruit (Cyphomandra betacea Cav.) was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and diethylaminoethyl-Sepharose chromatography. Protease activity was determined on selected peak fractions using a casein substrate. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the peak with the highest protease activity consisted of one protein of molecular mass ca. 70 kDa. The protease showed optimal activity at pH 11 and 60 degrees C. It was sensitive to phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride while ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid had little effect on its activity, indicating that this enzyme was a serine protease. Hg2+ strongly inhibited enzyme activity, possibly due to formation of mercaptide bonds with the thiol groups of the protease, suggesting that some cysteine residues may be located close to the active site. De novo sequencing strongly indicated that the protease was a subtilisin-like alkaline serine protease. The protease from tamarillo has been named 'tamarillin'.

AB The effects of fining with various plant proteins were assessed on Aglianico red wine, using both the young wine and wine aged for twelve and twenty-four months, and including wine unfined or fined with gelatin as controls. Color traits and fining efficiency were considered, along with the content of various types of phenolics and of aroma-related compounds of either varietal or fermentative origin. All agents had comparable fining efficiency, although with distinct kinetics, and had similar effects on wine color. Individual plant proteins and enzymatic hydrolyzates differed in their ability to interact with some anthocyanins, with specific proanthocyanidins complexes, and with some aroma components of fermentative origin. Changes in varietal aroma components upon fining were very limited or absent. Effects of all the fining agents tested in this study on the anthocyanidin components were most noticeable in young red wine, and decreased markedly with increasing wine ageing.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effects of thermally processed diet (TD) on the muscle nutritional values of southern catfish in two experiments (named E1 and E2). Compared to non-thermally processed diet (ND), TD did not significantly affect proximate composition of southern catfish, but increased moisture content and decreased protein content in E1. Meanwhile, it had no effect on overall fatty acid profiles of the catfish rich in PUFA. Southern catfish had high proportions of indispensable amino acids (IAA, 44.6-46.4% of total fatty acids), with the highest contents of lysine (1551-1808 mg/100 g wet weight muscle). However, TD altered profiles of the IAA, particularly decreased 68.5% and 68.4% of methionine, and 9.5% and 10.7% of lysine in E1 and E2, respectively. Conversely, it increased 45.4% and 83.4% of dispensable fatty acid proline. These results suggest TD could affect the nutritional quality of protein rather than fat in farmed fish.

AB The aim was to evaluate (i) the phenol and flavonoid recovery and bioaccessibility indexes, (ii) the stability of individual polyphenolic compounds and (iii) the antioxidant activity of persimmon flours (cultivars 'Rojo Brillante' and 'Triumph') during the in vitro digestion. The recovery index for phenolic and flavonoid content was dependent on flour type and digestion phase. After the dialysis phase, the bioaccessibility for phenolic compounds from both flours was similar; for flavonoids it was higher in 'Triumph' than 'Rojo Brillante' flour. After in vitro digestion, 13 polyphenolic compounds were detected in both flours, of which only six were detected in the intestinal phase. Their antioxidant activity (ABTS. , FRAP and DPPH) decreased after intestinal phase, while their chelating activity (FIC assay) increased in both flours. So, persimmon flours could be included in the formulation of foods to improve either their scarcity of bioactive compounds or an unbalanced nutritional composition.

AB To investigate the contribution of autochthonous microflora on free fatty acids (FFA) release and flavor development in low-salt fermented fish, three groups of processed fish, including bacteriostatic-acidification group (BAG), bacteriostatic group (BG), and spontaneous fermented fish (CG) were established. Results showed that addition of NaN3 reduced microbial load in BAG and BG below 3.5 log CFU/g after 3 weeks of incubation. Activities of lipases and lipoxygenase declined markedly with increasing time, where BG had the highest activities, followed by CG and BAG. There is a 36.3% higher in the total FFA content in CG than that in BAG, indicating both microbial and endogenous lipases contributed to the FFA liberation in fermented fish while endogenous lipases play a major role. However, compared to BAG and BG, largely higher levels of volatile compounds were observed in CG, suggesting that autochthonous microflora dominated the generation of volatile flavor compounds in fermented fish.

AB Based on single factor and orthogonal experiments, optimal fermentation conditions for longan wine were Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain of Lalvin K-D, juice content of 70% and alcohol content of 10 degrees. Sixteen amino acids were detected. Proline, alanine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid contents were relatively high. Sixty-three volatile aroma compounds were identified using solid-phase micro extraction and gas chromatography (SPME-GC). Ethyl lactate content was the highest, followed by octanoic acid ethyl ester, isoamyl alcohol and decanoic acid ethyl ester. Main functional components were polysaccharides. Longan wine polysaccharide (LWP) with molecular weight 10-30 kDa exhibited the highest hypoglycemic and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activities. 10-30 kDa polysaccharides mainly consisted of glucose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid in molar ratio of 167.72:3.38:3.13:3.46:2.33:1. Infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra confirmed that the sugar ring of 10-30 kDa polysaccharides was in the beta -configuration.

AB The aim of study was to analyze the flavonoid composition of dietary supplements using the UHPLC-MS/MS method and to evaluate the antioxidant activity using the DPPH center dot-UV and DPPH center dot-UHPLC-UV methods.
   In the first part of the study a new method was developed for simultaneous determination of several flavonoids in dietary supplements. The amounts of flavonoids were in the range from 0.013 to 347 mu g/g.
   In the second part of the study, the traditional DPPH center dot-UV method and UHPLC-UV method combined with a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH center dot) assay were used. After application of both methods, the obtained results were similar, and the order of flavonoids depending on their antioxidant activity is the same. The effect of individual compounds on activity in combination with another flavonoid with similar or different antioxidant potentials was evaluated. The dependence of antioxidant activity on the number, type and location of the basal rings in the ring can be noted.

AB A continuous high voltage electric discharge (HVED) extraction system with "annular gap type" treatment chamber was for the first time designed and optimized for flavonoids extraction from peanut shells, and a comparison with the HVED system with the "converged electric field type" treatment chamber and warm maceration was carried out. The optimal conditions for the "annular gap type" design were: 25% ethanol concentration as solvent, 30:1 mL/g liquid to solid ratio, 13 kV peak pulse voltage and 60 mL/min flow rate of material. Under these conditions, the maximum yield of flavonoids was 0.948 +/- 0.014%. Compared with the "converged electric field type" design and warm maceration, the "annular gap type" design possessed shorter duration and higher efficiency for the flavonoids extraction, and had no effects on the composition of extracted flavonoids. The results showed that the "annular gap type" design was a promising alternative method in extracting flavonoids from peanut shells.

AB This research aimed at investigating the effects of different weight-average molecular weights (M-w: T10, T70, T250, T750, T2000) of dextran (alpha-(1 -> 6)-linked linear backbone, alpha-(1 -> 3)-linked branching) on wheat sourdough bread qualities. Texture analyzer showed that dextran contributed to a significant inhibition of bread staling, particularly dextran T2000. Pasting profiles (Rapid visco-analysis) and steady rheological properties (steady shear measurements) of samples indicated that dextran T2000 suppressed the swelling and gelatinization of wheat starch granules and bound a great amount of water, thus retarding the aging process. Dextran T2000 markedly improved the elastic properties of sourdough-containing dough. Wheat sourdough breads containing dextran T10 exhibited unexpected less firm crumb structure. The improvement of bread qualities was a function of the M-w of dextran. Dextran with high Mw values has the potential for improving the quality of wheat sourdough breads, especially extending shelf life.

AB The rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry with carnivorous fish such as salmon has been accompanied by an equally rapid development in alternative feed ingredients. This has outpaced the ability of prevailing authentication method to trace the diet and origins of salmon products at the retail end. To close this gap, we developed a new profiling tool based on amino acid delta C-13 fingerprints. With this tool, we discriminated with high-accuracy among wild-caught, organically, and conventionally farmed salmon groups, as well as salmon fed alternative diets such as insects and macroalgae. Substitution of fishmeal with macroalgae was detected at 5% difference level. The delta C-13 fingerprints of essential amino acids appear particularly well suited for tracing protein sources, and the non-essentials for tracing lipid origins (terrestrial vs. aquatic). In an industry constantly developing new feed proteins and functional additives, our method is a promising tool for tracing salmon and other seafood products.

AB Konjac glucomannan (KGM) is a major polysaccharide from the corm of Amorphophallus konjac. Native KGM has limited uses and has been chemically/physically/enzymatically modified to expand the range of functional properties. This mini-review summarises the recent advances of modifying KGM for diverse food and nonfood applications, focusing on the chemical and physical modifications. The chemical methods include substitution, grafting, cross-linking, oxidation, and deacetylation, whereas the physical modifications are electrospinning, microfluidic spinning, gamma-irradiation, extrusion, and electric field processing. The modified KGM has been used in a range of different applications, including biodegradable film, emulsion, medical and pharmaceutical material, encapsulation and controlled release, fish feed and functional food ingredient, separation medium, aerogel, liquid crystal, absorbent for removal of pollutants in waste water, and so on. These KGM-based products tend to be biodegradable, biocompatible, and non-toxic with improved functional performance.

The covalent bond between the polyphenols and the amino acid sidechains in beta LG was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS and SDS-PAGE. Structural analysis by fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) indicated that the covalent conjugate of EGCG and CA led to the changed protein structure of beta LG. Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that conjugation of beta LG with these polyphenols was effective in reducing the IgE-binding capacity of beta LG. The conjugates maintained the retinol-binding activity without denaturation the protein and enhanced the thermal stability with high antioxidant activity. The study provides an innovative approach to producing hypoallergenic food.

AB Teleseismic waveforms from a passive array of 63 seismic stations are applied to image the 3-D P-wave velocity structure of the mantle in the Sumatra subduction zone. In this study, 102 teleseisms with good signal-to-noise ratios were selected. In total, 1627 P-wave relative arrivals have been extracted with high accuracy based on multi-channel cross-correlation and adaptive stacking methods. With this dataset, we conducted the 3-D tomographic inversions for the 3-D P-wave velocity structure of the upper mantle in the Sumatra subduction zone. The tomographic results suggest significant lateral variations of P-wave velocity in the mantle, The trench parallel low-velocity features in the upper mantle reveal that there may be a trench-parallel flow associated with 3-D mantle flow beneath the subducting slab. The subducting Indo-Australian Plate is also clearly imaged as a continuous high-velocity anomalous zone in the mantle along the Sumatra Island. Beneath southern Sumatra, there could have a lateral detachment of high-velocity anomaly from 560 km to the deep part of the slab, which may imply the slab tearing. If it is true, we could infer that this tear in the slab may be terminated around 17.5 Ma. The advancing speed of the Indo-Australian Plate increasing from North Sumatra to South Sumatra plays a key role in the slab tear, which suggests likely that the northeastward subducting of the Indo-Australian Plate along the Sunda trench and the southeastward clockwise motion of the Sunda Shelf may form a torque tracing the Sumatra Island that facilitated the clockwise rotation of the fast-moving plate. With the oblique subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate, the asymmetric distribution of stresses along this torque on either side may induce the slab tearing.

AB The Rongna Cu-(Au) deposit is a recently discovered giant low-grade composite porphyry-high sulfidation epithennal system in the Duolong ore district of central Tibet. We present zircon U-Pb ages, bulk-rock geo-chemical and Sr-Nd isotope data, as well as zircon Hf-O isotope data to constrain the petrogenesis of the Rongna granodioritic porphyry, on which the ore system is centered. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) zircon U-Pb data for two samples yielded ages of 118.7 +/- 0.9 Ma and 117.1 +/- 0.9 Ma, respectively. The granodioritic porphyry is of high-K talc-alkaline and magnetite-series affinity, with enrichment of light rare earth elements (LREEs) and large-ion lithophile elements (e.g., Rb, Pb, and K), and depletion of high-field strength elements (e.g., Ta, Nb, and Ti), typical of the geochemical signature of arc magmas. The Rongna granodioritic porphyry has initial Sr isotopic ratios of 0.7060-0.7099, and epsilon(Nd)(t) values of -5.7 to -1.7 with T-DM (Nd) of 983-1900 Ma. The zircons have relatively narrow Hf-O isotopic compositions (epsilon(Hf)(t) = + 3.30- + 6.43; 8180 = + 5.94- + 6.96 parts per thousand), indicating the involvement of old crustal materials. Our data suggest that the Rongna granodioritic porphyry likely evolved by fractional crystallization from a hybrid magma of mantle-derived mafic melts and lower crustal felsic melts during a period of magmatic flare-up following flat-slab subduction.

AB The Altay orogenic belt of Kazakhstan and China incorporates one of the world-class volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) polymetallic metallogenic belt. More than 12 large and superlarge VMS deposits have been found in this belt. The Ashele Basin is located at the western end of the Chinese Altay bordering Kazakhstan and hosts the large Ashele copper-zinc deposit, which is a typical VMS deposit and the largest one in this basin. The principal orebodies are stratabound and located between basalt and tuff units in the Ashele Formation. The mineralization has a two-layered structure that consists of an upper stratiform, concordant, massive Cu-Zn (or barite) orebody, and a lower veinlet-disseminated and stockwork Cu (or Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag) orebody associated with silicic alteration. Several exhalative rocks, such as barite, hematitic jasper, pyrite and silicified units also occur.
   Here we investigate the ore-forming fluids of the exhalative-sedimentary units including jaspilte, stratiform barite and Cu-Zn orebodies which cany fluid inclusions that show homogenization temperatures of 100-410 degrees C, with two peaks around 230 and 150 degrees C, and low salinity (clustering between 2 and 8 wt% NaCl equiv), corresponding to NaCl-H2O fluids. The ore-forming fluids of the vein orebody and silicified zones are characterized by low to medium temperature (peak homogenization temperatures between 120 and 280 degrees C), low to medium salinity (0.7-12.3 wt% NaCI equiv), and H2O-CO2 (+/- CH4/N-2)-NaCl fluids. The delta S-34 values of barite associated with the stratiform barite orebody range from 20.4 parts per thousand to 21.4 parts per thousand, indicating that the sulfur was derived from the seawater. The sulfur isotope values of sulfide (-3.7 parts per thousand to 7.7 parts per thousand with a mean of 3.1 parts per thousand) are similar to those of VMS deposits from other parts of the world. The host volcanic rocks are inferred to be the major source from which the mineralizing fluid leached the ore-forming elements. The He-3/He-4 ratios of fluid inclusions in pyrite are in the range of 0.136-0.260 (R/Ra), broadly similar to the helium ratios of the crust The Ar-40/Ar-36 ratios range from 394 to 9515, and are higher than those of atmospheric argon. The Ar-40/He-4 ratios of the ore fluids range from 0.002 to 0.064 with a mean of 0.034. The helium and argon isotope compositions of fluid inclusions suggest that the ore fluids of the Ashele deposit were mainly derived from the crust and were mixed with a minor amount of mantle component The delta O-18(SMOW) values of quartz from the silicified zones and vein orebody range from 8.3 parts per thousand to 11.1 parts per thousand, with corresponding delta O-18(fluid) values of -4.45 parts per thousand to 2.24 parts per thousand, whereas the SD values of fluid inclusions are between -140 parts per thousand and -90 parts per thousand. The delta O-18(SMOW) values of barite from the stratiform barite orebody range from 7.7 parts per thousand to 9.1 parts per thousand, with corresponding delta O-18(fluid) values of -3.03 parts per thousand to 1.79 parts per thousand, with SD values of fluid inclusions showing a range of -162 parts per thousand and -135 parts per thousand. The combined isotopic data (H-O and He-Ar) suggest that the ore-forming fluids of the Ashele deposit were mainly derived from deep circulation of seawater and mixed with magmatic fluids. The decrease in temperature and pressure, water-rock exchange, and changes in the composition of ore fluids played important roles in the ore-forming processes of the Ashele Cu-Zn deposit.

AB The "Yanshanian movement" (tectonism) was first recognized in the Western Hills of Beijing and represents the most intense Mesozoic tectonic event in eastern China. Although many researches have been conducted since its identification in 1927, the timing for initiation of the Yanshanian tectonism has not been well constrained. The Jurassic sedimentary succession in the Western Hills of Beijing consists of two volcanic units and interbedded coal-bearing strata, which is similar to those in other regions of the Yanshan Fold-and-Thrust Belt (YFTB). As the earliest Mesozoic volcanism in the Western Hills of Beijing, the Nandaling Formation contains the earliest volcanic and sedimentary records that are associated with the initiation of the Yanshanian tectonism. Previous researches considered the Nandaling volcanic rocks as Early Jurassic in age based on the floral fossil assemblage of Coniopteris-Phoenicopsis in the Yaopo Formation that conformably overlies the Nandaling Formation. In this study we perform a systematic geological survey and present the results of zircon U-Pb dating of the Nandaling volcanic rocks to demonstrate that both the Nandaling volcanic rocks and the overlying floral fossil assemblage are Middle Jurassic in age. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of the Nandaling volcanic rocks in the northern part of the basin yields eruption ages of 175 +/- 1 to 168 +/- 2 Ma. Dioritic porphyry sills are intruded concordantly into folded Mesoproterozoic-lower Paleozoic strata of the Qingbaikou anticline, and yield a zircon U-Pb age of 177 +/- 1 Ma. These ages indicate that the initiation of the Yanshanian basins, and therefore the initiation of the Yanshanian tectonism, occurred no earlier than the Middle Jurassic. Our Ar-40-Ar-39 dating of the Nandaling volcanic rocks yields younger ages of 138-151 Ma that show a southward-younging trend, indicating that the Nandaling volcanic rocks in the Western Hills of Beijing were overprinted by a tectono-thermal event that peaked during the Early Cretaceous.

AB Background: Rapid advancements in biomedical research have accelerated the number of relevant electronic documents published online, ranging from scholarly articles to news, blogs, and user-generated social media content. Nevertheless, the vast amount of this information is poorly organized, making it difficult to navigate. Emerging technologies such as ontologies and knowledge bases (KBs) could help organize and track the information associated with biomedical research developments. A major challenge in the automatic construction of ontologies and KBs is the identification of words with its respective sense(s) from a free-text corpus. Word-sense induction (WSI) is a task to automatically induce the different senses of a target word in the different contexts. In the last two decades, there have been several efforts on WSI. However, few methods are effective in biomedicine and life sciences.
   Methods: We developed a framework for biomedical entity sense induction using a mixture of natural language processing, supervised, and unsupervised learning methods with promising results. It is composed of three main steps: (1) a polysemy detection method to determine if a biomedical entity has many possible meanings; (2) a clustering quality index-based approach to predict the number of senses for the biomedical entity; and (3) a method to induce the concept(s) (i.e., senses) of the biomedical entity in a given context.
   Results: To evaluate our framework, we used the well-known MSH WSD polysemic dataset that contains 203 annotated ambiguous biomedical entities, where each entity is linked to 2-5 concepts. Our polysemy detection method obtained an F-measure of 98%. Second, our approach for predicting the number of senses achieved an F-measure of 93%. Finally, we induced the concepts of the biomedical entities based on a clustering algorithm and then extracted the keywords of reach cluster to represent the concept.
   Conclusions: We have developed a framework for biomedical entity sense induction with promising results. Our study results can benefit a number of downstream applications, for example, help to resolve concept ambiguities when building Semantic Web KBs from biomedical text.

AB Objective: Evaluate potential for data mining auditing techniques to identify hidden concepts in diagnostic knowledge bases (KB). Improving completeness enhances KB applications such as differential diagnosis and patient case simulation.
   Materials and methods: Authors used unsupervised (Pearson's correlation - PC, Kendall's correlation - KC, and a heuristic algorithm - HA) methods to identify existing and discover new finding-finding interrelationships ("properties") in the INTERNIST-1/QMR KB. Authors estimated KB maintenance efficiency gains (effort reduction) of the approaches.
   Results: The methods discovered new properties at 95% CI rates of [0.1%, 5.4%] (PC), [2.8%, 12.5%] (KC), and [5.6%, 18.8%] (HA). Estimated manual effort reduction for HA-assisted determination of new properties was approximately 50-fold.
   Conclusion: Data mining can provide an efficient supplement to ensuring the completeness of finding-finding interdependencies in diagnostic knowledge bases. Authors' findings should be applicable to other diagnostic systems that record finding frequencies within diseases (e.g., DXplain, ISABEL).

AB Background: The majority of current medical CBIR systems perform retrieval based only on "imaging signatures" generated by extracting pixel-level quantitative features, and only rarely has a feedback mechanism been incorporated to improve retrieval performance. In addition, current medical CBIR approaches do not routinely incorporate semantic terms that model the user's high-level expectations, and this can limit CBIR performance.
   Method: We propose a retrieval framework that exploits a hybrid feature space (HFS) that is built by integrating low-level image features and high-level semantic terms, through rounds of relevance feedback (RF) and performs similarity-based retrieval to support semi-automatic image interpretation. The novelty of the proposed system is that it can impute the semantic features of the query image by reformulating the query vector representation in the HFS via user feedback. We implemented our framework as a prototype that performs the retrieval over a database of 811 radiographic images that contains 69 unique types of bone tumors.
   Results: We evaluated the system performance by conducting independent reading sessions with two sub specialist musculoskeletal radiologists. For the test set, the proposed retrieval system at fourth RF iteration of the sessions conducted with both the radiologists achieved mean average precision (MAP) value similar to 0.90 where the initial MAP with baseline CBIR was 0.20. In addition, we also achieved high prediction accuracy (> 0.8) for the majority of the semantic features automatically predicted by the system.
   Conclusion: Our proposed framework addresses some limitations of existing CBIR systems by incorporating user feedback and simultaneously predicting the semantic features of the query image. This obviates the need for the user to provide those terms and makes CBIR search more efficient for inexperience users/trainees. Encouraging results achieved in the current study highlight possible new directions in radiological image interpretation employing semantic CBIR combined with relevance feedback of visual similarity.

TI Chemical-induced disease relation extraction with dependency information

SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS

DE CDR extraction; Dependency information; Prior knowledge; Attention
   mechanism
AB Chemical-disease relation (CDR) extraction is significantly important to various areas of biomedical research and health care. Nowadays, many large-scale biomedical knowledge bases (KBs) containing triples about entity pairs and their relations have been built. KBs are important resources for biomedical relation extraction. However, previous research pays little attention to prior knowledge. In addition, the dependency tree contains important syntactic and semantic information, which helps to improve relation extraction. So how to effectively use it is also worth studying. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional attention network (CAN) for CDR extraction. Firstly, we extract the shortest dependency path (SDP) between chemical and disease pairs in a sentence, which includes a sequence of words, dependency directions, and dependency relation tags. Then the convolution operations are performed on the SDP to produce deep semantic dependency features. After that, an attention mechanism is employed to learn the importance/weight of each semantic dependency vector related to knowledge representations learned from KBs. Finally, in order to combine dependency information and prior knowledge, the concatenation of weighted semantic dependency representations and knowledge representations is fed to the softmax layer for classification. Experiments on the BioCreative V CDR dataset show that our method achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art systems, and both dependency information and prior knowledge play important roles in CDR extraction task.

DE Non-conservative hyperbolic equations; Godunov-type methods; Roll waves
ID TO-DETONATION TRANSITION; ROLL-WAVES; MODEL; JUMP
AB The mathematical model of shear shallow water flows of constant density is studied. This is a 2D hyperbolic non-conservative system of equations that is mathematically equivalent to the Reynolds-averaged model of barotropic turbulent flows. The model has three families of characteristics corresponding to the propagation of surface waves, shear waves and average flow (contact characteristics). The system is non-conservative: for six unknowns (the fluid depth, two components of the depth averaged horizontal velocity, and three independent components of the symmetric Reynolds stress tensor) one has only five conservation laws (conservation of mass, momentum, energy and mathematical 'entropy'). A splitting procedure for solving such a system is proposed allowing us to define a weak solution. Each split subsystem contains only one family of waves (either surface or shear waves) and contact characteristics. The accuracy of such an approach is tested on 2D analytical solutions describing the flow with linear with respect to the space variables velocity, and on the solutions describing 1D roll waves. The capacity of the model to describe the full transition scenario as commonly seen in the formation of roll waves: from uniform flow to 1D roll waves, and, finally, to 2D transverse 'fingering' of the wave profiles, is shown.

AB In this paper, we present an adaptive variational procedure for unstructured meshes to capture fluid-fluid interfaces in two-phase flows. The two phases are modeled by the phase-field finite element formulation, which involves the conservative Allen-Cahn equation coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The positivity preserving variational formulation is designed to maintain the bounded and stable solution of the Allen-Cahn equation. For the adaptivity procedure, we consider the residual-based error estimates for the underlying differential equations of the two-phase system. In particular, the adaptive refinement/coarsening is carried out by the newest vertex bisection algorithm by evaluating the residual error indicators based on the error estimates of the Allen-Cahn equation. The coarsening algorithm avoids the storage of the tree data structures for the hierarchical mesh, thus providing the ease of numerical implementation. Furthermore, the proposed nonlinear adaptive partitioned procedure aims at reducing the amount of coarsening while maintaining the convergence properties of the underlying nonlinear coupled differential equations. We investigate the adaptive phase-field finite element scheme through the spinodal decomposition in a complex curved geometry and the volume-conserved interface motion driven by the mean curvature flow for two circles in a square domain. We then assess the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed procedure by modeling the free-surface motion in a sloshing tank. In contrast to the non-adaptive Eulerian grid counterpart, we demonstrate that the mesh adaptivity remarkably reduces the degrees of freedom and the computational cost by nearly half for similar accuracy. The mass loss in the Allen-Cahn equation via adaptivity process is also reduced by nearly three times compared to the non-adaptive mesh. Finally, we apply the adaptive numerical framework to solve the application of a dam-breaking problem with topological changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The future resilience of water supply systems is unprecedentedly challenged by non-stationary processes, such as fast population growth and a changing climate. A thorough understanding of how these non-stationarities impact water supply resilience is vital to support sustainable decision making, particularly for large cities in arid and/or semi-arid regions. In this study, a novel modeling framework, which integrates hydrological processes and water management, was established over a representative water limited metropolitan area to evaluate the impacts of water availability and water demand on reservoir storage and water supply reliability. In this framework, climate change induced drought events were selected from statistically downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 outputs under the Representative Concentration Pathway 83 scenario, while future water demand was estimated by the product of projected future population and per capita water use. Compared with the first half of the 21st century (2000-2049), reservoir storage and water supply reliability during the second half century (2050-2099) are projected to reduce by 16.1% and 14.2%, respectively. While both future multi-year droughts and population growth will lower water supply resilience, the uncertainty associated with future climate projection is larger than that associated with urbanization. To reduce the drought risks, a combination of mitigation strategies (e.g., additional conservation, integrating new water sources, and water use redistribution) was found to be the most efficient approach and can significantly improve water supply reliability by as much as 15.9%.

AB This study quantifies morphological evolution of the Dez River, Iran, from 1955 to 2016. The approach uses a sequence of Landsat images, aerial photos, and topographic maps. In addition, the hydrological data including average daily discharge and yearly maximum discharge at the Dezful hydrological station for the period (1955-2016) were used. The study reach was divided into 48 meander loops from upstream to downstream. Active channel width (w) was determined at 10 m intervals and changes assessed along the study reach of the Dez River. Morphological indices including sinuosity index; straight meander length; centerline flow length; erosion area; erodible length channel migration; centerline elongation; and radius of curvature were calculated in the reach. Results showed that the study reach of the Dez River changed dramatically in response to major floods, although the general trend is towards a narrowing of active channel width by 38% in the period 1955-2016. Results show that most of the meander loops in the study area extended and expanded. Between 1989 and 1995, all types of meander change were observed. There was a direct correlation between the frequency of hydrological events (flood days) bigger than 2-years return period and elongation of bends.

AB Sustainable river basin planning and management is a complex and uncertain phenomenon involving social, economic, environmental and several technical criteria. Despite global advancement, the problems associated sustainability have not been sufficiently addressed, due to mismanaged governance, poorly implemented policies, lack of suitable data and over-exploitation of river resources. Therefore, major rivers basins across the globe need an integrative and comprehensive strategic approach considering the diverse stakeholder's perspective and conflicting criteria pertaining to sustainable management. The present study develops a decision support framework to assess the sustainability by coupling an improved fuzzy based hybridized strength-weakness-opportunities and threats model (FH-SWOT) with a geostatistical approach. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model Ganges river basin, India has been taken as a case study. The novelty of the study is to devise six different hybrid mechanisms under FH-SWOT framework to reach best possible strategic alternatives along with nominal, optimistic and pessimistic perspectives of the stakeholders. To enhance the model's productivity, it is coupled with weighted overlay geo-statistical approach to identify/prioritize the most vulnerable/critical locations, which needs suitable implementation of strategic alternatives derived using FH-SWOT model. The FH-SWOT model developed herein simultaneously delineates strategic alternatives and corresponding priority zones, while addressing the uncertainties related to stakeholder's conflicts and imprecise data to reach optimal, pessimistic and nominal viewpoints, which leads to development of an innovative and comprehensive decision-support framework for assessing sustainability. The key policies derived from the study involve enforcing regulations on disposal of heavy metals, developing hydropower, adaptation of organic farming, education and participation of stakeholders, regulations on dams and barrages with a score of 0.2453, 0.2205, 0.2088, 0.1898, and 0.1288 respectively. Also, Kanpur-Varanasi stretch has been delineated as very high priority zone followed by regions located along the banks of Ganges. Sensitivity analysis proves that the model is robust and can be used by the environment managers towards sustainable planning and management of any river basin, lakes, wetlands or any major water body of the world.

AB Rainfall frequency analysis, which is an important tool in hydrologic engineering, has been traditionally performed using information from gauge observations. This approach has proven to be a useful tool in planning and design for the regions where sufficient observational data are available. However, in many parts of the world where ground-based observations are sparse and limited in length, the effectiveness of statistical methods for such applications is highly limited. The sparse gauge networks over those regions, especially over remote areas and high-elevation regions, cannot represent the spatiotemporal variability of extreme rainfall events and hence preclude developing depth-duration-frequency curves (DDF) for rainfall frequency analysis. In this study, the PERSIANN-CDR dataset is used to propose a mechanism, by which satellite precipitation information could be used for rainfall frequency analysis and development of DDF curves. In the proposed framework, we first adjust the extreme precipitation time series estimated by PERSIANN-CDR using an elevation-based correction function, then use the adjusted dataset to develop DDF curves. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our proposed approach in 20 river basins in the United States with different climatic conditions and elevations. Bias adjustment results indicate that the correction model can significantly reduce the biases in PERSIANN-CDR estimates of annual maximum series, especially for high elevation regions. Comparison of the extracted DDF curves from both the original and adjusted PERSIANN-CDR data with the reported DDF curves from NOAA Atlas 14 shows that the extreme percentiles from the corrected PERSIANN-CDR are consistently closer to the gauge-based estimates at the tested basins. The median relative errors of the frequency estimates at the studied basins were less than 20% in most cases. Our proposed framework has the potential for constructing DDF curves for regions with limited or sparse gauge-based observations using remotely sensed precipitation information, and the spatiotemporal resolution of the adjusted PERSIANN-CDR data provides valuable information for various applications in remote and high elevation areas.

AB Different aspects of management policies for shallow geothermal systems are currently under development. Although this technology has been used for a long time, doubts and concerns have been raised in the last years due to the massive implementation of new systems. To assess possible environmental impacts and manage subsurface energy resources, collecting data from operating shallow geothermal systems is becoming mandatory in Europe. This study presents novel advances in the upscaling of operation datasets obtained from open-loop geothermal energy systems for an optimal integration in hydrogeological models. The proposed procedure allows efficient numerical simulations to be performed at an urban scale. Specifically, this work proposes a novel methodology to optimize the data treatment of highly transient real exploitation regimes by integrating energy transfer in the environment to reduce more than 90% registered raw datasets. The proposed methodology is then applied to and validated on five different real optimization scenarios in which upscaling transformation of the injection temperature series of 15-min sampling frequency has been considered. The error derived from each approach was evaluated and compared for validation purposes. The results obtained from the upscaling procedures have proven the usefulness and transferability of the proposed method for achieving daily time functions to efficiently reproduce the exploitation regimes of these systems with an acceptable error in a sustainable resource management framework.

AB A wide range of real-world flood routing problems can be approached using the Parabolic Approximation, widely recognized as a convenient simplification of the Saint Venant equations. From the Parabolic Approximation, head and discharge-based linear and non-linear advection-diffusion models were also derived by merging mass and momentum conservation equations into a single second-order equation to be used for one-dimensional flood routing. Both head and discharge-based advection-diffusion models were originally derived in their linear forms and extensively studied in the literature because they admit analytical solutions. The discharge-based non-linear models have been used as the basis for the derivation of the variable-parameter Muskingum routing method by setting the truncation error at par with the diffusion parameter. Whereas the linear models are mass-conservative, but inadequately reproduce routing in a variety of cases, the non-linear ones have been recently declared to be non-conservative. In the literature it has also been stated that the variable-parameter Muskingum fails to approximate the discharge-based non-linear discharge based advection-diffusion model on mild slopes. This paper aims at providing a systematic overview of all these models, showing that whereas the non-linear head-based advection-diffusion model, an original version of which is derived here, is in fact conservative, also the discharge-based model, which in principle is not, remains de facto conservative if integrated over a space-time grid with sufficiently small spatial cells. To complete the overview, we also demonstrate that in real-world applications the variable parameter Muskingum gives satisfactory results on mild slopes because lowland rivers in nature are essentially prone to slowly rising hydrographs. The results of all models are intercompared by routing different flood waves through prismatic reference channels with slope 10(-4) and smaller.

AB Flood forecasting is a pre-emptive non-structural measure used to mitigate inundation. Most current flood forecasting techniques incorporate complex processes, such as training and optimization, before the technique can be applied. Conventional flood forecasting techniques, based on flood volume, provide alerts even if there is no significant risk of flood damage. In this study, a new flood forecasting technique has been developed based on likely flood damage using the multi-dimensional flood damage analysis method. This new flood forecasting technique overcomes the drawbacks of current flood forecasting techniques because it can be easily applied using rainfall data. The studied drainage area was divided into subareas, and the damage functions were obtained for each subarea using the flood volumes and damage information. Using these damage functions, the rainfall intensity when the flood damage initially occurred was calculated for each duration and subarea. The damage graph produced for flood forecasting in each subarea identified the rainfall intensities and durations that resulted from the initial occurrence of flood damage. This new flood forecasting technique could be used to save lives, valuable assets, and manage drainage areas.

AB Water-use efficiency (WUE) at the whole-plant level plays as an important role as an indicator of both the water use strategy of the plant, and the ecophysiological processes linking the carbon and water cycles. However, the variation in the annual pattern of WUE, the interannual trends, and the regulating factors of WUE in rubber plantations remain poorly understood. Here, we used a four-year (2013-2016) continuous biometric survey along with sap flow data recorded at a monthly resolution to examine the annual and interannual dynamics of WUE and the relationships of WUE with environmental and biological factors in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations in Southwest China. The results showed that (1) there was no definitive pattern in WUE between April and December, but the peak WUE values generally occurred around August; (2) the multi-year mean WUE was 2.34 +/- 0.19 g C.kg(-1) H2O, and a negative correlation of WUE to photosynthetically active radiation was found at the interannual scale (r = -0.962, P < 0.05); and (3) a moderate, significant and parabolic relationship of WUE with air temperature (R-2 = 0.40), net radiation (R-2 = 0.37) and growth rate of the diameter at breast height (R-2 = 0.35) was observed at the monthly scale during the growing season (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that WUE might be regulated by factors affecting the carbon sequestration rather than water consumption, and it will provide a deeper understanding of the ecohydrological and coupled processes between the carbon and water cycles of rubber plants.

AB Although mangrove forests are efficient natural carbon sinks, most of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed by its vegetation is believed to be exported via tidal exchange, rather than stored in the vegetative biomass and sediment. However, the magnitude of tidal export is largely unknown because direct measurements are scarce. We deployed a novel experimental design that combined automated high-resolution measurements of hydrodynamic, hydrogeochemical and biogeochemical parameters during the dry season in a mangrove tidal creek in the Can Gio Mangrove Forest in Vietnam. The objective was to quantify the tide-controlled water, porewater, DIC and DOC exchange, and estimate the CO2 evasion throughout tidal cycles contrasted by amplitude. Data from three 25-h time series showed a dear peak of DIC, DOC, pCO(2), and Rn-222 at low tide, particularly during tidal cycles of large amplitude, which directly relate to porewater discharge. Our mass balance models revealed that the tidal creek was a net exporter of dissolved carbon to coastal waters, with an important contribution (38%) coming from DIC in porewater discharge. Porewater exchange varied from 3.1 +/- 1.6 to 7.1 +/- 2.4 cm day(-1). DIC exchange ranged from 352 +/- 34 to 678 +/- 79 mmoIC m(-2) day(-1); DOC exchange, 20.6 +/- 1.9 to 67.7 +/- 7.9 mmol C m(-2) day(-1); and CO2 evasion, 69.9 +/- 10.5 to 173.7 +/- 26.1 mmoIC m(-2) day(-1). These estimates were in the high range of previous carbon assessments and were explained by (i) the monitoring station being located at equal distance from the head and the mouth of the creek, which minimized carbon degradation and losses associated to transport in water; and (ii) the site being a highly productive mangrove within South East Asia.

AB Many studies suggest that high-density rain gauge networks are required to capture the rainfall heterogeneities necessary to accurately describe the components of the hydrological cycle. However, equipping and maintaining a high-density rain gauge network will also involve high costs. Although many studies provided useful insights on the required accuracy of rainfall estimates to accurately describe the components of the hydrological cycle, most of these studies focused on streamflow simulations, large river basins or urban environments. The objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in areal rainfall, estimated at several spatial resolutions, on hydrological simulations of a small similar to 6.5 km(2) rural lowland catchment. The approach followed in this study is to force a calibrated spatially-distributed hydrological model (SPHY) with rainfall retrieved from an X-band radar and various synthetic rainfall products, calculated using bootstrap samples of a varying number of radar pixels, treated as virtual rain gauge locations within the catchment. This enables us to determine the most appropriate resolution of rainfall data to accurately describe the hydrology of a small rural lowland catchment. We found that the use of one rain gauge to estimate the catchment's areal rainfall may lead to a potential error of more than six times the average hourly rainfall. This may lead to uncertainties in simulated discharge that approach 60% of the average hourly discharge. More than 40 rain gauges are required to reduce the potential error in areal rainfall estimation to values < 0.1 mm h(-1). The associated uncertainty in discharge simulations is 20% if 10 rain gauges are used, and 10% if 40 rain gauges are used. The simulation of soil moisture contents and evapotranspiration rates are hardly affected by the number of rain gauges used to estimate the areal rainfall, which is due to the high saturated hydraulic conductivities of the top-soil. At least 12 gauges per km2 are required to capture the spatial rainfall variation that is present in radar rainfall estimates. Analysis of an individual 18-h rainfall event revealed that the uncertainty in peak areal rainfall estimated using one rain gauge may range between -100% and 600%. The associated uncertainty in simulated discharge for this event ranges between -67 and 233%. With 25 rain gauges the uncertainty in simulated discharge is still in the range of -17 to 33%.

AB A vast amount of future climate scenario datasets, created by climate models such as general circulation models (GCMs), have been used in conjunction with watershed models to project future climate variability impact on hydrological processes and water quality. However, these low spatial-temporal resolution datasets are often difficult to downscale spatially and disaggregate temporarily, and they may not be accurate for local watersheds (Le., state level or smaller watersheds). This study applied the US-EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)'s Climate Assessment Tool (CAT) to create future climate variability scenarios based on historical measured data for local watersheds. As a case demonstration, CAT was employed in conjunction with HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN) model to assess the impacts of the potential future extreme rainfall events and air temperature increases upon nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and orthophosphate (PO4) loads in the Lower Yazoo River Watershed (LYRW), a local watershed in Mississippi, USA. Results showed that the 10 and 20% increases in rainfall rate, respectively, increased NO3-N load by 9.1 and 18% and PO4 load by 12 and 24% over a 10-year simulation period. In contrast, simultaneous increases in air temperature by 1.0 degrees C and rainfall rate by 10% as well as air temperature by 2.0 degrees C and rainfall rate by 20% increased NO3-N load by 12% and 20%, and PO4 load by 14 and 26%, respectively. A summer extreme rainfall scenario was created if a 10% increase in rainfall rate increased the total volume of rainwater for that summer by 10% or more. When this event occurred, it could increase the monthly loads of NO3-N and PO4, by 31 and 41%, respectively, for that summer. Therefore, the extreme rainfall events had tremendous impacts on the NO3-N and PO4 loads. It is apparent that CAT is a flexible and useful tool to modify historical rainfall and air temperature data to predict climate variability impacts on water quality for local watersheds.

AB Soil freeze-thaw is typically not fully considered in quantifying the hydrology of seasonally frozen catchments located, for instance, on the Third Pole. We investigate the role of soil water content and freeze-thaw state on the runoff dynamics of the headwaters of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, both situated on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. A version of augmented Noah land surface model (LSM) allowing reliable simulation of key hydro meteorological processes over the Tibetan Plateau is employed and further validated using measured monthly discharge records. From measurements supported by the Noah LSM simulations for more than thirty years (1979-2010), we deduce an annual hysteresis loop, viz. a time lag between measured/simulated runoff and precipitation for both catchments. Our simulation results with the augmented Noah LSM further demonstrate that annual anticlockwise (or clockwise) hysteresis loops are also observed for the liquid soil water (or soil ice). We infer from the LSM simulations that the amount of water stored in the soil is the factor driving the hysteresis between runoff and precipitation, whereby the state of the stored water plays a crucial role in the seasonality of the runoff regime. Further analyses illustrate that inclusion of soil freeze-thaw model physics effectively increases the thermal inertia of the soil column that dampens large variations of soil temperature and turbulent heat fluxes. These findings highlight the importance of soil freeze-thaw for the hydrology and runoff regime across the High Asia's rivers as well as the need for a thorough understanding of this process to generate reliable projections.

AB Surface flows of hydrological interest, including overland flow, runoff, river and channel flow and flooding have received significant attention from modellers in the past 30 years. A growing effort to address these complex environmental problems is in place in the scientific community. Researchers have studied and favoured a plethora of techniques to approach this issue, ranging from very simple empirically-based mathematical models, to physically-based, deductive and very formal numerical integration of systems of partial-differential equations. In this work, we review two families of methods: cell-based simulators later called Cellular Automata - and Finite Volume solvers for the Zero-Inertia equation, which we show to converge into a single methodology given appropriate choices. Furthermore, this convergence, mathematically shown in this work, can also be identified by critically reviewing the existing literature, which leads to the conclusion that two methods originating from different reasoning and fundamental philosophy, fundamentally converge into the same method. Moreover, acknowledging such convergence allows for some generalisation of properties of numerical schemes such as error behaviour and stability, which, importantly, is the same for the converging methodology, a fact with practical implications. Both the review of existing literature and reasoning in this work attempts to aid in the effort of synchronising and cross-fertilizing efforts to improve the understanding and the outlook of Zero-Inertia solvers for surface flows, as well as to help in clarifying the possible confusion and parallel developments that may arise from the use of different terminology originating from historical reasons. Moreover, synchronising and unifying this knowledge-base can help clarify model capabilities, applicability and modelling issues for hydrological modellers, specially for those not deeply familiar with the mathematical and numerical details.

AB A novel form of the lattice Boltzmann method for the Saint-Venant equations (LABSVE) is formulated and implemented. To eliminate equidistant property of the lattice structure being the major drawback of the LBM, and thus establish the LB model as tool for practical application (natural water bodies) fully competitive compared to the presently available computational models, new form of equilibrium distribution function (EDF) based on geometrically transformed Saint-Venant equations (SVE) is derived. Introducing the metric relation function between the physical and computational system, the non-uniform spatial discretization is managed by solving the transformed SVE rather than altering the symmetrical properties of lattice structure. Since the geometrical correlation between the two corresponding systems is introduced into the transformed SVE, the very basic structure of the LBM in terms of simplicity in implementing the boundary conditions and computational efficiency (owing to the parallel structure) is maintained and further improved by removing the limitations imposed by the equidistant lattice condition. Furthermore, the discharge-water level definition of the SVE as more applicable form when natural watercourses are considered, is applied. In this way the bed slope term is completely eliminated from the equations, establishing therefore a model more suitable for natural systems characterized by arbitrary cross sectional geometry. In order to test the proposed non-equidistant LABSVE model, steady flow in prismatic channel, unsteady flow in non-prismatic channel of simple cross section geometry, and unsteady flow along a Danube section is modelled. Additional simulations by using the HEC-RAS modelling tool are conducted in order to produce comparison basis for both unsteady simulations, while in case of the Danube River section actual water level and discharge measurements are additionally used for calibration and verification of the model. Very good agreement between compared results is obtained showing that the proposed non-equidistant form of the LABSVE is capable of solving complex environmental problems, maintaining the order of accuracy, simplicity and efficiency of the basic LBM.

AB Watershed management in rainfed agricultural areas of arid and semi-arid regions aims at alleviating agricultural drought by employing water conservation measures. Water conservation measures serve as mechanisms for recharging groundwater, and also for surface storage. While the benefits derived from these structures is widely accepted, there is increasing concern regarding their sustainability and efficiency. The application of water conservation measures in upstream reaches contributes to reduced inflows to downstream reaches and structures. Currently watershed management is planned by considering elementary information about the hydrological regime and its associated impacts on the upstream reaches of the watershed. This approach may lead to inefficient water conservation structures, and there is also a significant probability that the structure may be under designed (or over designed). Therefore, careful planning that considers the hydrological changes that the conservation structure may bring in the watershed and the associated benefits/compromise for both upstream and downstream is essential for developing a successful watershed management plan. A simulation-optimization framework for optimal sizing of the water conservation structure considering the dual objectives of improving the benefits in the upstream reaches while maintaining flows in the downstream reaches is proposed in this study. The proposed method is demonstrated for optimal sizing of water conservation structures (check dams in this study) for an experimental watershed in Kondepi Mandal, Andhra Pradesh, India. The results indicate that the check dams of sizes obtained from both traditional method and simulation-optimization method increase moisture availability in the watershed. However, for check dam sizes obtained from the simulation-optimization framework, there is an increase in the flow to downstream reaches compared to the check dam sizes obtained from the traditional methods. The increase in downstream flows obtained by optimizing the check dam heights is at the expense of increased moisture stress days in the non-growing period, thus, not affecting the crop growth or productivity. The results from this study indicate that the proposed simulation-optimization framework can be of assistance in sizing of check dams for sustainable and effective watershed management.

AB Measuremental and methodological problems arising from the presence of ice cover on waterways have seriously hindered the progress in predicting timely and accurate streamflow, which is a prerequisite for the effective management of ice-covered waterways (e.g. streams, rivers, channels, and canals). Among various methods in the attempt to address this issue, the most attractive is the physically-based method, which does not require abundant, and often unobtainable, data. This paper develops a physically based K-factor method, in the form of a generalized Manning equation, for discharge estimations in ice-covered channels. The main advantage of this method is that it enables the prediction of streamflow in ice-affected seasons by a K-factor adjustment of the stage-discharge relationship developed in the open-water seasons. The results of parameter estimation show that the K-factor is only related to the boundary resistance ratio, which is parameterized by two exponents of the two power law for describing the vertical streamwise velocity profile. Experimental measurements collected from the literature were used to test the applicability of the proposed formula, and to compare its relative accuracy with the Sabaneev and Larsen formulae. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate in estimating streamflow of ice-covered channels than these two widely-used formulae based on traditional two layer hypothesis.

AB An integrated hydrological model that couples a low-dimensional (2-D) subsurface model to 1-D river flow and 2-D overland flow is presented and applied to a real-world system. The 2-D subsurface equation stems from a careful integration a 3-D Richards equation along a local direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer. A Normally Integrated Model (NIM) is first compared with the integrated model CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) in regard to a synthetic test case with complex geometry, heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field of the subsurface compartment, and various interactions between the surface and the subsurface. This exercise reveals the gain in computation time associated with the use of a low-dimensional model (by a factor of 6). NIM is then applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of an actual restored hydrosystem, namely, Rohrschollen Island of the Upper Rhine River, with the aim of assessing the ability to address highly transient hydrological conditions and the efficiency of the restoration strategy. The calibration and validation steps associated with this exercise show that the coupled model describes the hydraulic head evolution and water mass balance induced by artificial injections of surface water in a channel dug for the purpose of reconnecting the Rhine to an old and clogged channel. The low-dimensional coupled model of this study is simpler than the state-of-the-art integrated models employing the solution of the 3-D Richards equation. It is, however, suited to investigate fine-scale problems in relation to water resource management and hydraulic developments, with reasonable computational costs and a physically-based approach to model flow processes.

AB Reservoir operations are increasingly being asked to consider environmental flow, which is needed to sustain a healthy river ecosystem. The Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) is a tool that is used widely to describe environmental flow regimes, but few studies have explicitly included its parameters in multi-objective reservoir operation models. With the goal of incorporating detailed environmental flow requirements into reservoir operations, this study proposes a two-objective reservoir operation model that includes explicit IHA constraints. A series of formulae is developed to calculate IHA parameters without using a loop or conditional statement, which allows operators to manage environmental flow directly. An experimental operation of the Jinghong reservoir in the upstream portion of the Mekong Basin is conducted to apply the method. The economic objective is defined by hydropower production (HP), while the environmental flow objective is represented by a weighted aggregate eco-index (ED based on IHA parameters. Five scenarios with different objective functions and constraints are compared, and the results show that the scenario with "HP-EI" as its objective achieved optimal benefits for both indices. Hard EI and explicit IHA constraints led to significant loss of HP that can be attributed to variations of inflow. To make this model more convenient for practical use, operation rule curves are regressed from the optimized results of the model. Finally, policy implications of the operation with economic and environmental objectives and some limitations are discussed. The quantification method of IHA parameters provides significant reference value for reservoir environmental operation issues.

AB Estimation of low-flow quantiles or indices at ungauged sites is traditionally done through regional low-flow frequency analysis. However, traditional methods imply a prior aggregation of the regional information due to the usual focus on a given quantile. This leads to loss of information for estimating additional quantiles or performing additional applications. In the present study, the recently proposed regional streamflow based frequency analysis (RSBFA) approach is evaluated for the estimation of low-flow quantiles. The approach, originally applied to floods, is based on regionally estimating the daily streamflow series at the ungauged site to later obtain hydrological quantiles through a local frequency analysis. In the present study, the RSBFA approach is applied to low flows through a case study in the province of Quebec, Canada, considered in prior traditional regional low-flow studies. Although the RSBFA approach does not systematically lead to the best results, its relevance resides in the fact that the whole regionally estimated daily streamflow series is provided at the ungauged site. This allows an easy estimation of low-flow quantiles associated to particular durations, such as the 7-day (30-day) average low flows corresponding to a return period of 2 or 10 years (5 years). Furthermore, a large range of additional low-flow quantiles, such as q(95%) (streamflow expected to be exceeded 95% of the time divided by the catchment area), may be obtained from the regionally estimated streamflow series with a very good performance. Therefore, any specific or absolute, annual or seasonal low-flow quantile may be easily obtained by a local low-flow frequency analysis without repeating the regional procedure. The approach does not require complex models, and it may also allow combining regional and local information in a straight forward manner.

AB Numeric criteria are crucial for controlling cultural eutrophication and for protecting current and future water quality. Anthropogenic climate change and the modification of land use have the potential to influence the development of nutrient criteria. In this study, stressor-response models, land use-nutrient regression models, and terrestrial ecosystem health states were used to determine the criterion values of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chl a) using field data from lakes and reservoirs in Heilongjiang Province. Analysis of covariance and nonlinear regressions were used to quantitatively characterize the impact of climate change on the development of nutrient criteria. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in the nutrient criteria obtained by the various methods. Climate change factors (such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) are predicted to influence the relationships between nutrients and Chl a, as well as land use and nutrient concentrations, as climate change persists. Climate change should be considered during the development of nutrient criteria, as climate-driven change and achieving a desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication in the future will require stricter nutrient criteria than those needed under the current climate conditions.

AB Random walk path methods including walk on spheres and walk on rectangles have been used to solve elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). These methods are able to provide not only the pointwise solutions to the linear PDEs but also contributions of boundaries and all source/sink terms as an analytical solution does. However, due to difficulty in dealing with heterogeneity, these methods cannot be applied to groundwater flow problems in highly heterogeneous aquifers. A novel method called walk on grid (WOG) is proposed based on lattice random walk to overcome the difficulty. WOG algorithm is verified in a 1D homogeneous transient problem, a 1D heterogeneous steady-state problem, a 2D heterogeneous transient problem and a 3D optimization problem. It is demonstrated that WOG is effective in solving groundwater flow problems in highly heterogeneous confined aquifers. Probabilities of walkers arriving at prescribed boundaries (terminal weights) and source counts may be useful for characterization of medium heterogeneity. WOG method sheds a new light on solving the PDEs of complicated groundwater problems in a changing environment and on analyzing medium heterogeneity.

AB Accurate evaluation of the relative contribution of climatic and vegetative drivers on land evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for interpreting the ET controlling mechanism, modeling and predicting. However, how to accurately separate and estimate the contribution of climatic and vegetative changes on ET variation remains uncertain. Our study attempted to interpret the interannual variation in ET during 2007-2013 over a maize field in northwest China, using four methods simultaneously, such as the Penman-Monteith (PM) model, the modified crop coefficient method, the Priestly-Taylor (PT) model and the regression linear model.
   Results indicate that compared to the ET in 2007, the ET decreased averagely by 12, 30, 29, and 73 W m(-2) in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. All models yielded similar results and showed that the vegetative controls played a more important role in regulating ET relative to climatic drives, and that more than half of decrease in ET was caused by vegetative factors, while the differences in net radiation, water vapor pressure deficit and air temperature among years were lesser source of variation in ET. Furthermore, the advantage and disadvantage of the four methods were discussed.
   Our study confirmed the great effect of vegetative drivers in regulating crop ET, highlighted the importance of estimating canopy conductance accurately in ET modeling and prediction, and provided new approaches for separating the climatic and vegetative contribution on ET changes.

AB Solute and/or heat penetration into a fracture-matrix system is an important subject in subsurface transport. Solute and/or heat partitions among the fracture and its surrounding rock matrixes are based on coupled transport processes that are closely related to transport properties of the media. The penetration processes in an asymmetric fracture-matrix system are more complicated than that in a symmetric fracture-matrix system, due to different matrix properties. Accurate quantification of plume distribution in such a system is the basis of re mediation design and risk assessment of a contaminated fracture-matrix system. Closed-form analytical and semi-analytical solutions (involving integrations) are obtained in this study to quantify the influences of asymmetric matrix properties on solute penetration processes in a fracture-matrix system. Advection, matrix diffusion, sorption, source decay and aqueous phase decay are considered. Numerical simulations are performed using HydroGeoSphere to test the solutions. Well matched curves of the numerical results and the closed-form solutions and semi-analytical solutions are obtained. The matrix porosity and retardation factor appear to significantly affect the spatiotemporal distribution of solute in a fracture-matrix system. Penetration depth in the matrix is a linear attenuation function of the horizontal distance from the source. And a new dimensionless number called the Z number (or the matrix penetration number) is defined to quantify the maximal penetration depth into the matrix. The solutions obtained can act as an effective tool for assessment of solute and/or heat transport in a fracture-matrix system. The solutions are also applicable to advection-dominated solute and/or heat transport in a thin aquifer bounded by two different aquitards.

AB We present artificial neural network (ANN) based software for rapidly predicting the recovery effectiveness (REN) of aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) wells in fresh water aquifers. The REN performance criterion equals the amount of the water injected in an ASR well that is recoverable via the same well during a specified extraction period. The software circumvents the need to prepare and run computationally intensive simulations, by invoking ANN models as surrogate simulators. The paper presents the development of the ANN models and a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate using the ANN models and to perform sensitivity analysis. ANN inputs include all factors significantly affecting REN in freshwater aquifers. The software can evaluate REN in any ASR system in confined aquifers whose parameters are within the range of parameters used for training the ANNs in this study.

AB Flow-sediment relationships provide insights into the erosion and transport of materials within catchments. Investigating the flow-sediment relationships across multiple timescales can reveal trends related to the effects of natural and human-caused changes to catchments. This study chose fourteen main catchments in the Loess Plateau of China, which are the major sediment sources of Yellow River, to extract the temporal patterns of flow-sediment relationships during the 1950s-2014 period. The study revealed quantifiable effects of land use/cover changes (LUCC) on the variability of flow-sediment relationships. The LUCC induced by the soil and water conservation measures (SWCMs) during 1970-1999 and vegetation restoration campaign since 2000 resulted in significant reductions of annual streamflow, sediment yield and sediment concentration. The mean daily sediment concentration under different flow conditions also decreased greatly. The flow-sediment relationships revealed time dependence over different stages and time scales. Before 2000, the annual and monthly flow-sediment relationships could be generally characterized by the linear functions, and the power-law sediment rating curve was able to describe the daily flow-sediment relationship. As vegetation restoration campaign took effect, the flow-sediment relationship became much weaker, which could not be described by a clear relationship. This suggests that the variability of flow-sediment relationships over the entire period was mainly regulated by the vegetation restoration campaign. In addition, the sediment concentration exhibited a linear decreasing relationship with the area under land use/cover treatment. In this way, the study has brought out the roles of ecological restoration measures in controlling the temporal variability of flow-sediment relationships at the catchment scale.

AB The areas of glacial lakes in the Himalayas continue to increase alarmingly due to global warming with consequent risk of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). The outburst is most common for moraine-dammed lakes as a result of a failure of the dam by overtopping and erosion or piping due to seepage. In the present context, GLOF events, especially for the moraine dam failure process needs to be predicted to assess the drastic and detrimental impacts on the downstream river valley. This study focuses on validating an integrated model for simulating the failure of moraine dam by overtopping and erosion using a coupled numerical simulation model. The proposed numerical methodology is validated with the data from experiments in laboratory scale physical models. The results of the model are compared for both the erosional profiles during collapse of the dam and the resulting outflowing flood hydrograph. The primary finding is that the moraine dam height and the volume of the lake upstream of the dam are the most sensitive parameters influencing the GLOF peak. The model is also applied to the field problem of the Tangjiashan lake outburst and dam failure and shows reasonably good agreement with observations. The validated model is also run for the South Lhonak glacial lake in the Sikkim Himalayas, India to obtain the probable flood hydrograph in case of failure of the moraine dam.

AB Although numerous studies have investigated the relationships between hydrological drought (HD) and meteorological drought (MD) in different regions, few studies have examined the influence of reservoir operations during drought periods on such relationships, particularly at multiple time scales. This study presents a useful framework to examine the influences of reservoir operation rules during drought periods on the multi-scale correlations between HD and MD. Two standardized drought indices (Standardized Streamfiow Index (SSI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)) with different timescales (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months) were used to compare the pre-reservoir and post-reservoir periods. Also, a simple algorithm was proposed to examine the difference value (D-value) between the inflow and outflow under different reservoir operation rules and it was used to evaluate the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought on the correlation of the HD and MD. Monthly streamflow and precipitation records from 1960 to 2015 and monthly inflow and outflow records of a large reservoir (Xinfengjiang reservoir) during 1974-2009 in the basin of the Dongjiang River in south China were used to demonstrate the applicability of the analysis methodology. The results indicate that (1) the reservoir operations during the post-reservoir period (1974-2015) exerted a significant influence (positive impact) on the evolution of the short-term (1 and 3 months) HD by reducing the drought duration and alleviating its magnitude and altered the linear correlation between the HD and MD compared to the pre-reservoir period (1960-1972). However, the effects on the long-term (e.g., 12 and 24 months) HD and its correlation with the MD were not apparent. (2) The impacts of the reservoir operation under the drought condition on the relationship between the HD and MD were clearly different from those under normal rules. This study provides additional information for policy-makers to regarding reservoir management during a drought.

AB A warming climate is expected to perturb the hydrological cycle, resulting in changes to both the frequency and duration of drought, especially in arid and semiarid grassland. Although considerable attention has been paid to the responses of key water fluxes to severe drought, few have explored the effects of prolonged drought on evapotranspiration (ET), its partitioning into vegetation transpiration (T) and soil evaporation (E), and its relationship with vegetation productivity. In this study, we used a combination of the eddy covariance (EC) flux technique and satellite remote sensing products to evaluate the effects of prolonged drought on ET components based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency (uWUE). The results showed T accounted for about 51% (standard deviation +/- 0.03%) of ET during prolonged drought lower than those in normal and/or wet years (range, 59-62%). We detected strong positive relationships between the T/ET ratios and aboveground biomass (AGB), leaf area index (LAI), and precipitation (R-2 of 0.80, 0.58, and 0.49, respectively). The specific responses of ecosystem functioning to prolonged drought indicated that grassland ecosystem was able to resist the drought disturbance and retain vegetation growth to a certain extent unless extreme drought hit. The results implied that more intense and prolonged droughts will result in ecological degradation and substantial changes in ecosystem functioning. And these results improve our understanding of how the climate change will affect the function and structure of grassland ecosystem.

AB In this work, we propose a mathematical model within a dynamic optimization framework to address the management of a salt lake in a semiarid region in Argentina (Chasico Lake). The main objective is to elaborate strategies to control recurrent floods and keep salinity values around the physiological optimum for the high-commercial value fish silverside. The model comprises dynamic mass balances for water and salt, as well as evaporation calculation based on energy and momentum balances on a daily basis. A collection of meteorological and hydraulic data in the basin for several decades and bathymetric information is included. The simulation of different scenarios with historical data provide a deeper insight into the ecohydrological dynamics of Chasico, Lake basin. Model predictions under moderate drought conditions, with rainfall about 70% of the historic average, show a large increase in salinity after three years under that setting. This would induce drastic changes in ecological conditions producing fish mass mortality, what likely occurred repeatedly throughout the lake's history, since such dry periods occurred repeatedly during the analyzed 1911-2016 period. The comparison between drought and wet scenarios indicates a differential vulnerability dynamics in which the system shows less resistance to the effects of drought than to those due to floods. The proposed model allows the determination of optimal lake tributary diversion flowrate to prevent flooding of croplands, keeping lake salinity within optimal values for silverside, and providing water for the creation of wetlands for wildlife and an artificial reservoir for alleviation of wet period effects.

AB Regionalization and pooling stations to form homogeneous regions or communities are essential for reliable parameter transfer, prediction in ungauged basins, and estimation of missing information. Over the years, several clustering methods have been proposed for regional analysis. Most of these methods are able to quantify the study region in terms of homogeneity but fail to provide microscopic information about the interaction between communities, as well as about each station within the communities. We propose a complex network-based approach to extract this valuable information and demonstrate the potential of our approach using a rainfall network constructed from the Indian gridded daily precipitation data. The communities were identified using the network-theoretical community detection algorithm for maximizing the modularity. Further, the grid points (nodes) were classified into universal roles according to their pattern of within- and between-community connections. The method thus yields zoomed-in details of individual rainfall grids within each community.

AB Quantifying the role of embedded-rock fragments in soil-water processes on a slope is crucial for the application of rock fragments in soil and water conservation practice. In this study, a laboratory runoff and erosion experiment was conducted in the soils embedded with rock fragments (including five rock fragment contents (RC) of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 kg kg(-1)) in a metal flume under three slopes (5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees). Results showed that the mean steady infiltration rate in the soil without rock fragment (NULL) was lower than that in the soils containing rock fragments (low rock fragment contents of 0.1-0.2 kg kg(-1) and high rock fragment contents of 0.3-0.4 kg kg(-1), labelled as LOW and HIGH, respectively) as slope gradient = 5 degrees, but was higher than the latter two soils as slope gradients = 10 degrees and 15 degrees. Initial infiltration rate significantly increased with RC (P < 0.05). Runoff discharge was negatively related to RC as slope gradient = 5 degrees and was positively related to it as slope gradients = 10 degrees and 15 degrees. There was a steady sediment concentration (SC) after runoff generated as slope gradient = 5 degrees. Sediment discharge and soil erosion modulus for the treatment of HIGH significantly increased with slope gradient (P < 0.05). Reynolds number (Re) decreased with RC and the other hydraulic parameters of friction coefficient (f), shear stress (tau), and stream power (omega) increase with RC. In general, the embedded-rock fragment in the soil can accelerate soil erosion by changing the ratio of infiltration/runoff, surface roughness, and related hydraulic parameters, especially under higher slope gradients. Our findings suggest that using rock fragments to control soil erosion is workable only under the conditions of lower slope gradients and rock fragment contents.

AB Continental flow plays a significant role in the global ecosystem. With increased global warming and a booming economy exacerbating water scarcity, global analyses of continental discharge are of great relevance to water management. In this paper, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, with variations accounting for lag-1 autocorrelation, full autocorrelation, and long-term persistence, was used to detect the long-term flow trends in 916 of the world's largest ocean-reaching rivers over the period 1948-2004. Field significance was evaluated using Walker's test. Globally, the results revealed more decreases in streamflow than increases. With the traditional MK test, 503 rivers had decreased streamflow, with 120 showing significant decreases, whereas 408 rivers had increased streamflow, with 51 showing significant increases. Regionally, positive streamflow trends mainly occurred in high-latitude areas and negative streamflow trends mainly occurred in low-latitude areas, a pattern that can be attributed to uneven precipitation and the effects of global warming. When the full autocorrelation structure and long-term persistence behavior were taken into account in the trend analysis, there was a large reduction in the number of rivers with significant changes in streamflow. Negligible departures from the traditional MK results were observed when only the lag-1 autocorrelation was taken into consideration. For the Americas and Europe, annual integrated river flow showed a slight upward trend; for other continents, there was a slight downward trend. For all oceans except the Arctic Ocean, integrated river flow had a downward trend. We investigated the causal relationships between streamflow and ocean signals using the Granger causality test. El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals were significantly causal for river flow in over 36% of global rivers tested. The influence of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was significant in more than a quarter of rivers studied. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was responsible for the variation in streamflow for over a quarter of rivers studied. Streamflow was affected by the interactions between ocean signals as well as by anthropogenic activities.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of static and dynamic land use input conditions on the performance of non-point source (NPS) model and find out whether dynamic land use input can improve the model accuracy. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was selected as the evaluation model and seven different land use input conditions were set by setting the land use update file in SWAT. The results showed that the land use pattern in the study area changed from 2000 to 2015 due to climate change and human activities, leading to inconsistencies between different land use patterns. The calibrated results indicated that dynamic land use input conditions could apparently improve the simulation accuracy of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). CE5Y condition had the best calibrated result with R-2 and NSE larger than 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. However, for flow simulation, the land use input conditions had no apparent effect on the model calibration and validation results. The deviation analysis of the model outputs indicated that monthly outputs were more affected by the land use input conditions than annual outputs and that deviations in wet seasons were larger than those in normal and dry seasons. The highest MAD occurred in June and August with a value of 82.87 t and 1.56 t for TN and TP, respectively. This study revealed the importance to consider the land use change when simulating the NPS pollution, and could provide support for land use input settings of NPS pollution models.

AB This paper presents a case study on an ancient drainage system in the Hetao old urban center, Ganzhou, China, which is playing a key role in the prevention of urban flooding. The system includes ancient city walls, a Fushou ditch, and ponds. The ancient city walls were constructed to defend the river water intrusion. The Fushou ditch and ponds primarily served for the drainage and storage of the rainwater, respectively. The process of rainwater management in the Ganzhou ancient drainage system, including the guidance, storage, infiltration, purification and utilization, and drainage of rainwater, confirms the feasibility of the design concept of modern sponge city. Based on the lessons learnt from this ancient drainage system, the guideline for the rainwater management and design of sponge city is proposed. It is suggested that the sponge city should be planned before the new urban development. During the construction of sponge city, the dispersed ponds and the ditches made of durable and permeable materials in Ganzhou ancient drainage system are recommended to increase the amount of infiltration, storage and utilization of rainwater.

AB The Heihe River basin is one of the important bases for commercial grain production in China. The climate change impacts on crop yield and crop water productivity (CWP) need to be examined for sustainable development of regional agriculture, especially under the pressure of population growth and regional water scarcity. A distributed hydrological model was constructed for the upper-middle reaches of the Heihe River basin on the basis of the Soil and Water Assessment Model (SWAT). The sensitivity ranks of hydrological parameters were evaluated for the runoff and evapotranspiration processes, and then independently calibrated with the observations of three gauging stations (Qilian, Zhamashike, and Yingluoxia stations) and the evapotranspiration data derived by remote-sensing. The study first simulated crop yield and CWP for four typical crop types, namely corn, spring wheat, spring barley, and spring canola-Polish, for the period of 1966-2014 using the SWAT model, calibrated with the crop yield data (during the period of 2005-2014) from Zhangye Statistics Yearbook. The spatial-temporal features of crop yield and CWP were analyzed. A fluctuating growth was found for the 49 year trend of corn, spring wheat, and spring canola-Polish. The spring barley shows a slightly decreasing trend. The high-yield area moved from the west part (Suzhou and Gaotai counties) to the east part (Linze, Ganzhou, and Shandan counties) of the basin for the past 49 years, and the area of high CWP concentrated in the Gaotai and Linze Counties. The responses of CWP to climatic forcing were further studied using wavelet coherence method. It is found that maximum temperature dominated the CWP evolutions, especially at the long-term scales. The corn showed the largest elastic responses to the climatic factors, which may be favorable to improve regional CWP by expanding planting area. In addition, the strategies of regional CWP improvement were discussed based on the results.

AB Simulation of variably saturated soil water flow requires the use of pressure head, or soil moisture, or a switching between the two, as the primary variable for solving Richards' equation. Under unfavorable conditions, such as heterogeneity, rapidly changing atmospheric boundary, or sudden infiltration into dry soils, the traditional non switching method suffers from numerical difficulties. Solving this problem with a primary variable switching method is less preferred due to the mathematical complexity. While the Picard method is more popular for solving the non-switching models due to its simplicity and stability, two different forms of Richards' equation are combined into one numerical scheme for switching under specific hydraulic conditions. The method is successfully implemented in a one-dimensional model solved by a Picard iteration scheme. A threshold saturation based on the soil moisture retention relation is used for switching between either form of the Richards' equation. The method developed here is applicable for simulating variably saturated subsurface flow in heterogeneous soils. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed model conserves mass well and is numerically more stable and efficient.

AB Satellite-based rainfall products (SRPs) are nowadays available at ever increasing accuracy and higher spatial and temporal resolution with respect to the past. Despite this, they are scarcely used in hydrological modeling. The main reasons may be related to: 1) the large bias characterizing satellite precipitation estimates, which is dependent on rainfall intensity and the season, 2) the relatively large spatial/temporal resolution with respect to the applications, 3) the timeliness, which is often insufficient for operational purposes, and 4) a general (often not justified) skepticism of the hydrological community in the use of satellite products for land applications.
   The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using SRPs to force a lumped hydrologic model - MISDc - over 15 basins in the Mediterranean area with different sizes and physiographic characteristics. Specifically, TMPA 3B42-RT, CMORPH, PERSIANN and a new soil moisture-derived rainfall datasets, SM2RAIN(CCI), obtained through the application of SM2RAIN algorithm (Brocca et al., 2014) to ESA CCI soil moisture product are used in the analysis. The performances obtained with the selected SRPs are compared with those obtained from a ground-based rainfall product (E-OBS). In addition, the performance obtained by an integration of the SRPs is investigated to see whether merged rainfall observations are able to improve flood simulations.
   The results highlight that SRPs provide relatively low performances when used to force MISDc model with respect to the case where ground observations are used. Worst results are obtained in smaller basins (< 500 km(2)) that, however, represent the main target for flood modelling in the Mediterranean area. Relatively better performances are obtained when independent SRPs are integrated each other, and particularly for the case where TMPA 3842-RT is integrated with SM2RAIN(CCI). In accordance with previous studies, this suggests that the exploitation (via integration) of independent sources of rainfall offers a potential way to reduce rainfall-induced streamflow errors, even in challenging areas like the Mediterranean.

AB The low-resolution characteristic of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) products greatly limits their application in many fields at regional or local scale. Aiming to overcome this limitation, a random forest (RF)-based downscaling approach was proposed in this study to disaggregate the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) SSM product with the synergistic use of the Optical/Thermal infrared (TIR) observations from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. The Iberian Peninsula was selected as the study area during the period from 2015 to 2016.
   First, the performance of the RF-based approach in building the SSM relationship model with surface variables (surface temperature, vegetation index, leaf area index, albedo, water index, solar factor, and elevation) was compared with that resulting from a widely used polynomial-based relationship model. Good agreement was achieved for the RF-based method with a correlation coefficient (R) above 0.95 and a mean root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.009 m(3)/m(3).
   Next, four data combinations (AM + Terra, AM + Aqua, PM + Terra, and PM + Aqua) were generated according to the different overpass times of the SMAP and MODIS observations, and they were separately used to derive the spatially downscaled SSM with the proposed RF-based downscaling method. Validation was performed with the in situ measurements from the REMEDHUS network of the University of Salamanca in Spain. The results indicated that all combinations have similar good performances with an unbiased root-mean-square difference (ubRMSD) of 0.022 m(3)/m(3), and the downscaled SSM at 1-km spatial resolution presented better accuracy while showing higher spatial heterogeneity and more detailed temporal pattern.
   Finally, the temporal changing pattern of the downscaled SSM was assessed with the precipitation time series from eight meteorological stations in the study area, and the rainfall effect on the variation of SSM was well tracked from its temporal changes.
   Overall, this study suggests that the proposed RF-based downscaling method is able to capture the variation of SSM well, and it should be helpful to improve the resolution of passive microwave soil moisture data and facilitate their applications at small scales.

AB Large tipping-bucket flow meters (TBFs, one tip > 200 ml) have been employed by hydrologists to quantify various water fluxes in a variety of contexts. The over-arching goal of this study is to develop a generalized correction equation for various TBFs. Based on our testing, we recommend the following to minimize TBF error: (1) periodic checking of the static calibration volume (c) since c is a gauge-specific value which has been found to vary after field deployment; and (2) for dynamic calibration, the use of our newly derived generalized correction equation when the tipping rate is less than 0.2 Hz. In equation form, the generalized correction equation for common TBFs with flat triangular buckets is: V = -0.75Q(2) + 0.72Q + 1 (R-2 = 0.843; p < 0.0001), where V = v/c and v is the water volume for one tip under dynamic conditions, and Q = q/c [s(-1)] and q is the water flow rate into the TBF. From our field test in a Japanese cedar forest stand, using stemflow (S-F) as an example, we found that use of the generalized correction equation was successful in eliminating the 2-3% error in S-F amounts. Moreover, we found that the generalized correction equation performed nearly as well as gauge specific derived correction equations. Thus, our generalized correction equation is applicable to correct flow estimates of TBFs when one does not have time and/or laboratory set-up for the laborious task of testing individual TBFs themselves. Although our correction procedure may not completely eliminate all error, we recommend use of the generalized correction equation for TBFs to improve the accuracy of water flux calculations in hydrologic studies.

   using a genetic algorithm based optimization approach
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article

ID CONTAMINANT PLUME; DESIGN; MANAGEMENT; MODELS
AB Management of groundwater requires a sufficient coverage of accurate groundwater quality data. These data are usually collected from monitoring wells which are spatially distributed in the river basin or the groundwater body that is studied. A minimum number of monitoring wells with an optimum spatial distribution is desired to ensure a cost-effective observation of the groundwater body. Therefore, the configuration of groundwater monitoring networks and the number of required wells becomes an important engineering optimization problem. The goal of this study is to find an optimum monitoring network with the fewest wells that provides sufficient spatial coverage on groundwater quality. With the presented method redundant wells in an already existing network are identified. Here, a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization approach is used in which each monitoring well in the watershed is represented with a binary GA bit to evaluate if the corresponding monitoring well will be selected for the network. The proposed approach can solve the problem by simultaneously optimizing two conflicting objectives. The first objective is the maximization of the match between the interpolated groundwater quality concentration distributions obtained using data from all available monitoring wells and the wells from the newly generated network. The match is primarily evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) model efficiency. Groundwater quality is represented by the water quality index (WQI) that aggregates several quality parameters. The second objective deals with the minimization of the number of monitoring wells in the newly generated network by considering cost-related constraints. These two objectives are integrated in a single objective function where different combinations of both objectives are investigated by considering two cases. The applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated for the groundwater monitoring network of the Gediz River Basin (GRB) which is one of the most important river basins in Turkey. Findings indicate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of monitoring wells with a relatively small deviation of the spatial distribution of the WQI values. Also, the monitoring network is optimized such that sampling points are removed from less polluted areas and selected in areas with higher pollutant concentrations.

AB Increasing meteorological data availability and quality implies an adaptation of the interpolation methods for data combination. In this paper, we propose a new method to efficiently combine weather radar data with data from two heated rain gauge networks of different quality. The two networks being non-collocated (no common location between the two networks), pseudo cross-variograms are used to compute the linear model of coregionalization for kriging computation. This allows considering the two networks independently in a co-kriging approach. The methodology is applied to the Upper Rhone River basin, an Alpine catchment in Switzerland with a complex topography and an area of about 5300 km(2). The analysis explores the newly proposed Regression co-kriging approach, in which two independent rain gauge networks are considered as primary and secondary kriging variables. Regression co-kriging is compared to four other methods, including the commonly applied Inverse distance weighting method used as baseline scenario. Incorporation of additional networks located within and around the target region in the interpolation computation is also explored. The results firstly demonstrate the added value of the radar information as compared to using only ground stations. As compared to Regression kriging using only the network of highest quality, the Regression co-kriging method using both networks slightly increases the performance. A key outcome of the study is that Regression co-kriging performs better than Inverse distance weighting even for the data availability scenario when the radar network was providing lower quality radar data over the studied basin. The results and discussion underline that combining meteorological information from different rain gauge networks with different equipments remains challenging for operational purposes. Future research in this field should in particular focus on additional pre-processing of the radar data to account for example for areas of low visibility of the weather radars due to the topography.

AB Groundwater, as the world's most important reserve of available fresh water, is known to be affected by urbanization. Managing this resource in a sustainable way is critical for water resource management. Groundwater recharge rates in urban areas remain however still poorly understood and under researched and knowledge about these rates and their expected changes under increasing urbanization is therefore of primary importance. This study aims to give insight into urban groundwater recharge by performing water budget calculations for four different time periods for an urban study site in northern Switzerland. In order to take into account uncertainty in parameter values a Monte Carlo (MC) approach was carried out.
   Our study highlights a strong positive correlation between groundwater recharge rates and the extent of the urban area. In detail, at the study site urban areas expanded from 6% in 1880 to 44% in 2009, leading to an increase in the mean groundwater recharge rate. However, the increase amount in recharge remains uncertain and varies between 29% and 67% depending on the parameter combination originating from the MC approach. Based on our water budget calculations, the transformation of natural landscapes into impervious areas leads to an increase in groundwater recharge rates due to the reduction of evapotranspiration that more than compensates for the increase in runoff. Furthermore, water main leakages contribute to an increase in recharge rates. Overall, we demonstrate that a better understanding of groundwater recharge changes in urban areas is required to move towards a sustainable water management. We hope that this example will encourage the hydrogeological community to pay more attention to urban groundwater recharge. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Application of stable isotope methods to evaluate the contribution of different water sources to groundwater recharge relies on the knowledge about isotopic signatures of these sources. The data collected at study sites in the Canadian Prairies show that snowpack isotopic signatures exhibit a high spatial variability over a small scale (<100 m) limiting the usefulness of point samples to estimate an average isotopic composition of snow over a large area. Isotopic signatures of snowmelt runoff can be different from those of pre-melt snowpack, further undermining the applicability of snow isotopic signature to characterisation of snowmelt-driven hydrological processes. Accounting for the actual signature of snow melt runoff has strong effects on its perceived role in recharging groundwater. The data also show that diffuse and depression-focussed components of groundwater recharge have different isotopic signatures, where the latter closely resembles snowmelt runoff.

AB Despite the efficient removal of many contaminants including pathogens and trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) during managed aquifer recharge (MAR), fate and transport of TOrCs in the subsurface might not always occur under conditions that favor effective biotransformation resulting in a contamination risk where water is recovered for drinking water production. A promising technology that can lead to improved removal of TOrCs is the sequential MAR technology (SMART), which combines two infiltration steps with an intermediate aeration to establish more favorable oxic and carbon-limited conditions resulting in enhanced TOrCs transformation. The aim of this study was to test the performance of the SMART concept under field conditions in comparison to a conventional MAR using pond infiltration (cMAR) operated in Berlin, Germany. Although oxic conditions were obtained at both field sites considering infiltration depth to 200 cm, redox conditions were more stable at the SMART facility fed with bank filtrate. In addition, carbon-limited conditions were solely observed during SMART. Chemicals known to persist during MAR, including candesartan, carbamazepine, dihydroxydihydrocarbamazepine, olmesartan, oxypurinol, phenylethylmalonamide, primidone, and tolyltriazole exhibited a refractory behavior at both field sites, whereas valsartan acid, metformin, and gabapentin-lactam were removed by more than 85% during 200 cm of infiltration. 4-Formylaminoantipyrine, acesulfame, benzotriazole, and gabapentin exhibited a significantly enhanced transformation during SMART compared to the cMAR site. These results confirm that SMART can result in controlled oxic and carbon-depleted subsurface conditions during MAR facilitating an improved transformation of moderately degradable TOrCs by natural treatment processes.

AB Climate change can directly influence groundwater systems through modification of recharge. Affecting not only groundwater levels and flow dynamics, climate change can also modify the fragmentation and hierarchy of groundwater flow systems. In this study, the influence of climate change - impacted recharge on groundwater levels and on inter-connected groundwater flow patterns is evaluated. Special emphasis is placed on how flow system hierarchy may change, to examine possible consequences on groundwater-related shallow surface water bodies and on groundwater - surface water interaction. As a test site with no significant anthropogenic impacts, the Tihany Peninsula in Hungary was an ideal area for the study. We address the following issues: i) How might a groundwater system, including groundwater-surface water interaction, be modified by predicted climate change?, ii) Given the variable groundwater levels and flow patterns, how will the water levels and fluxes be impacted around surface water bodies?, and iii) How sensitive are groundwater-related wetlands to these changes, and will they be maintained or will they eventually disappear? In order to answer these questions, two-dimensional transient numerical simulations were performed based on site-specific measurements and climatic prediction at the Tihany Peninsula. Results show that future climate trends can cause dynamic evolution and dissipation of transient groundwater flow systems, and the characteristic flow system hierarchy can change from nested flow systems to a set of single flow cells. Preservation of associated groundwater dependent ecosystems would be challenging under these conditions since long-term climate change could potentially have serious consequences, including wetland disappearance. Understanding these transient processes in two-dimensions can also help to set-up three-dimensional site-specific models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the crystallization kinetic of amorphous Fe0.7Nb0.1Zr0.1Ti0.1 was studied by differential thermal analysis to produce an appropriate amorphous/nanocrystalline microstructure for improving the soft magnetic properties. Amorphous Fe(0.7)NhodZr(0).Ti-1(0.1) alloy without metalloids was prepared by mechanical alloying of pure elements. The results showed that Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model was able to explain the crystallization kinetic of products as: d alpha/dt = beta d alpha/dt = 4.86 x 10(9) exp(-18776/RT)(1 Hin(1 - alpha)}(0.24). Moreover, volume diffusion control with three dimensional growth of the nuclei was the predominant mechanism of crystallization. The simulation results confirmed that by employment of kinetic model, it was possible to control the microstructure as combination of amorphous/crystalline phases and enhance the saturation magnetization from 59 to 142 Am-2/ kg and reduce the coercivity from 2.05 to 0.14 kA/m by controlling of crystallization progress at specific predefined a value.

AB In the present work, we studied the microstructure, thermal and magnetic properties of a Gd48Co50Nb2 amorphous ribbon for the purpose of revealing the mechanism of the table-like magnetic entropy change (-Delta S-m) profile of the ribbon. It was found that the amorphous ribbon was fully amorphous with only short-range orders. The two-step magnetic phase transitions indicate that there are two amorphous phases in the Gd48Co50Nb2 amorphous ribbon. The table-like -Delta S-m profile of the Gd48Co50Nb2 amorphous ribbon is supposed to be due to the superposition of two -Delta S-m peaks corresponding to two separated amorphous phases with different magnetic properties. The amorphous ribbon is expected to be a good candidate for magnetic refrigerant because of its high maximum -Delta S-m and high effective refrigeration capacity of the specific table-like -Delta S-m profile.

AB Two metakaolins exhibiting different reactivities were used to study geopolymers obtained via phosphoric acid activation. The study of consolidation of samples with various Si/Al and Al/P showed that the Al- and Si-rich and P-poor compositions were more likely to consolidate properly. The geopolymers formed at 20 or 70 degrees C kept the same crystalline impurities as the starting metakaolins, the samples remaining mostly amorphous. The microstructure of geopolymers formed with less reactive metakaolin was smooth and dense, while the geopolymers prepared from the most reactive one were more porous and rough. Finally, tests on water and fire resistances of all the samples were reported.

TI Blind estimation of DED camera gain in Electron Microscopy

LA English
DT Article
DE Single particle analysis; Electron microscopy; Direct detectors
ID XMIPP
AB The introduction of Direct Electron Detector (DED) videos in the Electron Microscope field has boosted Single Particle Analysis to a point in which it is currently considered to be a key technique in Structural Biology. In this article we introduce an approach to estimate the DED camera gain at each pixel from the movies themselves. This gain is needed to have the set of recorded frames into a coherent gray level range, homogeneous over the whole image. The algorithm does not need any other input than the DED movie itself, being capable of providing an estimate of the camera gain image, helping to identify dead pixels and cases of incorrectly calibrated cameras. We propose the algorithm to be used either to validate the experimentally acquired gain image (for instance, to follow its possible change over time) or to verify that there is no residual gain image after experimentally correcting for the camera gain. We show results for a number of DED camera models currently in use (DE, Falcon II, Falcon 3, and K2).

AB Symmetry in protein, and, more generally, in macromolecular assemblies is a key point to understand their structure, stability and function. Many symmetrical assemblies are currently present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and some of them are among the largest solved structures, thus an efficient computational method is needed for the exhaustive analysis of these. The cyclic symmetry groups represent the most common assemblies in the PDB. These are also the building blocks for higher-order symmetries. This paper presents a mathematical formulation to find the position and the orientation of the symmetry axis in a cyclic symmetrical protein assembly, and also to assess the quality of this symmetry. Our method can also detect symmetries in partial assemblies.
   We provide an efficient C++ implementation of the method and demonstrate its efficiency on several examples including partial assemblies and pseudo symmetries. We also compare the method with two other published techniques and show that it is significantly faster on all the tested examples. Our method produces results with a machine precision, its cost function is solely based on 3D Euclidean geometry, and most of the operations are performed analytically. The method is available at http://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/ananas. The graphical user interface of the method built for the SAMSON platform is available at http://samson-connect.net.

AB In the present study we have analyzed the molecular structure and function of the human skin's permeability barrier using molecular dynamics simulation validated against cryo-electron microscopy data from near native skin.
   The skin's barrier capacity is located to an intercellular lipid structure embedding the cells of the superficial most layer of skin - the stratum corneum. According to the splayed bilayer model (Iwai et al., 2012) the lipid structure is organized as stacked bilayers of ceramides in a splayed chain conformation with cholesterol associated with the ceramide sphingoid moiety and free fatty acids associated with the ceramide fatty acid moiety. However, knowledge about the lipid structure's detailed molecular organization, and the roles of its different lipid constituents, remains circumstantial.
   Starting from a molecular dynamics model based on the splayed bilayer model, we have, by stepwise structural and compositional modifications, arrived at a thermodynamically stable molecular dynamics model expressing simulated electron microscopy patterns matching original cryo-electron microscopy patterns from skin extremely closely. Strikingly, the closer the individual molecular dynamics models' lipid composition was to that reported in human stratum corneum, the better was the match between the models' simulated electron microscopy patterns and the original cryo-electron microscopy patterns. Moreover, the closest-matching model's calculated water permeability and thermotropic behaviour were found compatible with that of human skin.
   The new model may facilitate more advanced physics-based skin permeability predictions of drugs and toxicants. The proposed procedure for molecular dynamics based analysis of cellular cryo-electron microscopy data might be applied to other biomolecular systems.

AB Coral-like palladium-doped BiFeO3 (Pd/BFO) nanocomposite was synthesized via a simple two-step hydrothermal route. X-ray diffraction, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and vibrating sample magnetometer were used to investigate the crystallinity, morphology, optical and magnetic features of the samples. The synthesized samples exhibited enhanced visible light photoactivity for the degradation of malachite green dye as compared to those of pure BFO and commercial TiO2. The enhancement in the photoactivity was attributed to the formation of heterojunction between the Pd and BFO, which was beneficial for yield of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals as confirmed by photoluminescence-terephthalic acid test. Owing to the magnetic behavior of coral-like Pd/BFO, this nanocomposite can also be easily recovered by a magnetic field along with good reusability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel Bi12O17Br2 nanoparticle photocatalyst has been successfully prepared at room temperature by a facile hydrolysis route. The structure, morphology, band-gap, and optical property of Bi12O17Br2 were characterized by XRD, SEM, VB-XPS, Mott-Schottky method and DRS. The photocatalytic activity and stability of Bi(12)O(17)Br(2 )were evaluated by degradation of resorcinol under simulated sunlight irradiation. The results revealed that Bi12O17Br2 nanoparticle photocatalyst exhibits a superior reduction ability and photocatalytic activity. In addition, the repeated experiments displayed that Bi12O17Br2 has good chemical stability. Moreover, the inherent energy levels of Bi12O17Br2 make it very suitable for the photo-degradation of organics in environment, so Bi12O17Br2 has a potential practical application.

Porous CuO precursor with 200 nm shell was obtained by sintering PS (polystrene)/Cu core-shell structures in air. The PS/Cu composites were synthesized by electroless copper plating using PS as templates. The effects of reacting time on microstructures and compositions of copper azide were investigated. Results shows that copper azide can be synthesized in only 12 h and increasing time has no obvious influence on copper azide growth but promotes the hydrolyzed product forming. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB AuPd alloy nanoparticles (NPs) on ZnO nanorod arrays were synthesized by a facile physical vapor deposition (PVD) method - sputtering. The AuPd/ZnO heterostructures can be controlled by varying the sputtering time. Various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques were employed to characterize the nanocomposites. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiments showed that the nanocomposites possess excellent molecule sensing ability. Owing to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of noble metal nanostructures and the synergetic effect between AuPd alloy nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods, the AuPd/ZnO nanocomposites hold promise in molecule detection applications.

AB A novel ternary Ag/AgBr/Ag2WO4 composite was efficaciously prepared via a facile route. Various techniques were adopted to characterize the as-prepared catalysts. The resulting Ag/AgBr/Ag2WO4 composite with Ag/AgBr nanoparticles uniformly coated on Ag2WO4 nanorods displayed a markedly enhanced photocatalytic removal of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) antibiotic under visible light. Notably, the RhB degradation rate constant reaches up to 0.0575 min (1), 8.6, 22.9, 3.5 and 2.4 folds higher than those of AgBr, Ag2WO4, Ag/AgBr and AgBr/Ag2WO4, respectively. The remarkable activity enhancement and good durability are ascribed to the good formation of the ternary composites. The superoxide radicals were detected as the main active species responsible for RhB removal. A reasonable photocatalytic mechanism on Ag/AgBr/Ag2WO4 was brought up. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) interpenetrating network graphene/copper (G/Cu) composites were fabricated by in-situ growth of G on nanoporous Cu followed by rolling and sintering processes. In-situ growth of G network generate an intimate interface between G and Cu matrix, which is not only essential for high load transfer efficiency but also minimize the interfacial resistance. Moreover, the 3D interpenetrating network structure is propitious to fully exert the additional electronic transport pathway and loadbearing of 3D G, as well as helping to generate and store dislocation without initiating cracks. Consequently, the obtained composite exhibits an elegant combination of enhanced tensile strength (354 MPa), extraordinary ductility (16.5% elongation) and robust conductivity (98% IACS).

AB The crystallization behavior of 45S5 bioactive glass powders with two different particle sizes (<5 mu m, BG5 and <32 mu m. BG32) was investigated under non-isothermal conditions. The Ozawa and Augis-Bennett methods provided an Avrami coefficient close to 1 for both glass types, which suggests that surface crystallization was predominant during heat treatment. The Kissinger equation was used to determine the apparent activation energies for crystallization (E-c) that were found to be 250 +/- 3 and 311 +/- 9 kJ/mol for BG5 and BG32, respectively. The activation energies for viscous flow have also been assessed and were found higher than E-c (284 +/- 8 and 338 +/- 9 kJ/mol) for both particle sizes. It was noted that the process of crystallization for 45S5 glass could not be properly described by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) model and it appeared more complex than a simple nucleation-growth mechanism.

AB The modification of ZnIn2S4 with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was investigated by coupling the hole conductor property of PEDOT. After 180 min reaction, the total organic carbon (TOC) removal rates of 38%, 45%, 42% and 31% were achieved by 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mL PEDOT modified ZIS, respectively, which were higher than pristine ZIS of 24%. The obvious quenching of fluorescence was observed for PEDOT-ZIS sample, suggesting that the recombination of electron-hole pairs was suppressed comparing with pristine ZIS. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results implied the separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes was much easier over PEDOT-ZIS hybrid photocatalyst.

AB Bi2WO6 and I-doped Bi2WO6 photocatalysts were hydrothermally synthesized at 180 degrees C for 24 h. The as-synthesized products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The analytical results showed that Bi2WO6 and I-doped Bi2WO6 photocatalysts are Aurivillius orthorhombic phase, certifying that I atoms were incorporated in the Bi2WO6 matrix. The photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized Bi2WO6 and I-doped Bi2WO6 samples were evaluated via photodegradation of rhodamine B induced by visible radiation. In this research, the I-doped Bi2WO6 photocatalyst has higher photocatalytic activity than pure Bi2WO6. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, oxygen vacancy-rich ultrathin 2D nanosheets NiO were assembled onto 1D nanorod CdS by a facile solvothermal method for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. NiO/CdS with a hierarchical structure exhibits an outstanding photocatalytic activity, the H-2 evolution rate of which is as much as 43 mmol/g/h under visible light. According to various characterization results, photocatalytic mechanism about charge transfer process was proposed. Density functional calculations reveal that oxygen vacancies introduce a defect level in the bandgap of NiO, resulting an increased visible light absorption. Furthermore, the formed heterojunction in NiO/CdS efficiently separates the photogenerated holes and electrons, which enhances the photocatalytic activities. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out to illustrate the existence of oxygen defect. And the mechanism is proposed based on the concentration of Cd2+ ions after photocatalytic reaction. This study paves a new way to design highly efficient heterostructures rationally for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Self-assembled GaN pyramids were successfully fabricated on a SiNx layer that was grown in situ by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The diameter and height of a single pyramid was approximately 6-10 mu m, and the structure had six (10-11) semi-polar facets. According to micro-photoluminescence measurements obtained at different excitation power densities, the polarization field on the sidewall of the pyramids containing InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells was weak. The mechanism of atomic migration was deduced from the cathodoluminescence results. This type of structure can possibly be used for the fabrication of light-emitting diodes with multi-color emission.

AB In order to enhance the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of Sb2Se3, the three-dimensional (3D) sandwich-type graphene-Sb2Se3 thin films (TFs) were synthesized by in situ electrodeposition. The results showed that the graphene-Sb2Se3 TFs, in which reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets were sandwiched and tightly bounded to dense Sb2Se3 particles, had an optical band gap of 1.20 eV. The PEC measurements showed the rGO in the TFs greatly enhanced the charge carrier transfer and reduced the charge transfer resistance, and the corresponding rGO-Sb2Se3 TFs possessed a photocurrent density of -0.65 mA/cm(2) at 0 V-RHE, which was the highest value in the bare Sb2Se3 photoelectrodes. This work indicates the graphene-Sb2Se3 TFs are the potential candidate for photoelectrochemical water splitting as photocathode. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here we discuss the incorporation of Cr(III) as dopant in the spinel lattice of the NiCo2O4 cubic phase and its beneficial effect on the electro-catalytic activity of this material in aprotic Li-O-2 cells. To this aim, we synthesized highly porous carbon-free self-standing electrodes constituted by nanostructured undoped and Cr-doped NiCo2O4 grown on open nickel mesh. These materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The performance in aprotic Li-O-2 cells of the undoped and Cr-doped NiCo2O4 electrodes were tested in galvanostatic cycling using a LiTFSI 1 m in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte without the incorporation of any carbon conductive agent. Cr(III) doping discloses a remarkable enhancement of more than 300% of the discharge capacity at J = 0.1 mA cm (2). Moreover, the Cr-doped NiCo2O4 material is capable to give reversible limited capacity ORR/OER for 52 and 45 cycles at 0.2 mA cm (2)/0.1 mAh cm (2) and 0.1 mA cm (2)/0.2 mAh cm (2), respectively, without oxygen flow in static Ar/O-2 overpressures (p(o2) = 1 bar). Pseudo-Tafel data derived by galvanostatic titrations highlight the beneficial effect of Cr(III) doping on the electrode kinetics both for ORR and OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new nonplanar and soluble, donor-acceptor-donor system (3) based on a perylene diimide chromophore (1) consisting on 5-amino-4-cyano-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (2) as electron donating unit at imide position has been synthesized. The photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated in different solvents. All the results of structural characterization reveal that the thiophene units are not coplanar with the core of perylene diimide. Spectroscopic properties of 3 in solution show variations with the organic solvent used. In the polar aprotic and strongly electron donating solvents, such as DMF, DMAC and NMP, 3 exhibits intense absorption features in the UV-visible absorption spectrum covering the wavelength range of 300-800 nm with excellent absorptivity. Photoinduced electronic excitation energy transfer was noticed in polar aprotic solvents from electron donating substituent to the perylene core. The non-planar geometry of 3 prevented efficient energy transfer between donor and acceptor.

AB Upconversion (UC) materials enable the emission of a higher energy photon following the absorption of two or more lower-energy photons. The efficiency of UC is non-linear as it depends on the power density of the optical excitation. Hence, the measurement of the UC intensity as a function of excitation power density is a standard material characterization. Such a measurement reveals at which excitation power densities the UC material can be effectively used and hints at the underlying physical mechanisms of UC. One issue in the interpretation of these measurements is the decrease in the UC intensity due to the excitation-laser-induced heating of the sample. Here, we study the excitation-laser-induced heating of beta-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ (18/2%) micro-powders, ascertaining the temperature as a function of time (and the steady-state temperature reached) for a series of excitation power densities by monitoring the thermally coupled peaks in the emission of the Er3+ ion. Based on this, we demonstrate a technique to correct the excitation power density dependence of the UC in order to remove the effect of sample heating from the measured data. Correcting the reduction in UC intensity at higher power densities (> 50 W/cm(2)), we recover the UC excitation power density dependencies that agree with theoretical predictions (that disregard thermal effects) in the high excitation power density regime. The reduction in UC intensity due to sample heating can be significant; for example, a 60 K temperature rise lead to a 24% decrease in UC intensity at an excitation power density of 250 W/cm2. However, the heating does depend on the nature of the sample. In contrast to the powder samples, beta-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ (18/2%) nanoparticles in toluene solution showed no heating at excitation power densities up to 250 W/cm(2). Therefore, we conclude that the proposed correction can remove the effects of sample heating to allow accurate comparison to physical models, and is of especial relevance to powder samples due to their higher absorption of the excitation and poorer thermal transport.

AB In this article an experimental study of MgO-ZnO ceramic coatings prepared by a simple liquid polymer-salt method using high molecular polyvinylpyrrolidone is presented. It is demonstrated that this method permits to obtain the transparent and uniform coatings on the glass or silicon substrates surface. These transparent MgO-ZnO ceramic coatings show the ability to generate chemically active singlet oxygenunder UV irradiation. Structure and spectral properties of the coatings were studied by SEM, DSC, XRD methods, and optical and luminescence spectroscopy. These coatings consist of small (5-20 nm) oxide nanoparticles forming aggregates. The MgO addition to the coating composition increases its transparency in UV spectral range. The coating material bandgap value is higher than that of bulk material (up to 4,15 eV).

AB Continuous refractive index measurement in the UV spectral region and a small part of the Vis region (up to 520 nm) is performed by using white light spectral interferometry. The main limitations of operating in this region are the high dispersion and high absorption. The problems derived from high dispersion are overcome taking the data in several shots, that is, recording several interferograms that must be partially overlapped. Whereas, high absorbers require the use of thinner samples, while still keeping a precise measurement of the sample width. We show the capacity of the technique with well characterized reference materials such as BK7, quartz and deionised water.

AB The synthesis of zinc-zinc, gallium-gallium and indium-indium ball-type phthalocyanines (complexes 4, 5 and 6) and the surface assembly of the complexes onto metallic gold and silver nanoparticles are reported in this work. Furthermore, their photophysical and nonlinear optical dynamics were investigated. Decreases in the fluorescence quantum yields with a corresponding increase in the triplet quantum yields of the nanoconjugates in comparison to complexes 4, 5 and 6 alone were observed. The mechanism of strong reverse saturable absorption observed was found to be predominantly dependent on excited state absorption. The optical limiting thresholds range from 0.09 to 0.19 J/cm(2). Enhanced triplet parameters and nonlinear optical responses were found when the complexes were conjugated to metallic nanoparticles.

AB In order to decrease the fabrication process complexity and improve the color stability, a series of two complementary colors white phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (WOLED) are fabrication. The color stability of WOLED can be realized by increasing the thickness of the second hole transport layer (HTL2), which can weaken the hole mobility rapid raising with the increase of voltage and stabilize the recombination zone. The electroluminescence characteristic and color stability can be further improved by inserting ultrathin Flrpic emitting layer in HTL2.

AB Synthesis of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has become a major research area in the field of material science. Over the last two decades QDs have been employed successfully in sensitizing the mesoporous semiconductors like TiO2, ZnO etc. in various configurations thus giving birth to a new branch of low cost solar cells known as quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). In this paper we report low temperature synthesis of core-shell CdSe-CdS quantum dots (QDs) using wet chemical technique. A quantum dot solar cell (QDSC) was also prepared with the core-shell QDs as working electrode and a well explored solid polymer electrolyte. The QDSC was characterized and its stability was monitored for a period of two months in laboratory conditions.

AB Er3+ has been considered one of the most suitable sensitive ions of Ho3+ to generate 2 mu m emission. In this work, luminescent properties and energy transfer mechanism of Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped lead silicate glass were systematically investigated under 980 and 1550 run excitations, respectively. Based on the absorption spectra, the Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters, absorption and emission cross sections, and gain coefficient were calculated. The emission cross section of Ho3+: I-5(7) -> I-5(8) transition is as large as 8 x 10(-21) cm(2). And the calculated maximum gain coefficient is 3.48 cm(-1) at 2010 nm. In addition, the energy transfer efficiency between Er3+: I-4(13/2) level and Ho3+: I-5(7) level can reach 89.3% when the samples were pumped by a 980 nm laser diode. An intense 2 mu m emission was obtained upon excitation of 1550 nm due to the large absorption cross section of Er3+ at 1550 nm and efficient energy transfer from Er3+: I-4(13/2) level to Ho3+: I-5(7) level. These results suggest that the Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped lead silicate glass has great potential for application as a mid-infrared laser material.

ID AIE; FLUORESCENCE
AB A novel carbazole-based compound (L) has been synthesized with an asymmetric group, which possesses obviously intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process that was confirmed from the positive solvatochromic photophysical properties in different polar solvents. The introduction of nitro unit into L structure led the weak fluorescence emission, caused from the strong electron accepting character of nitro unit. L also demonstrated to exhibit superior aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE) properties. The torsion degree between C1-C18 bond and N19-C23 bond was 94.098 degrees, the introduction of benzoimidazolylcarbazole attached to the carbazole core generated the torsion degree of the whole molecule, which prevented n-n stacking between adjacent molecules and brought about AIEE property. The results were verified by time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The tortuosity of L molecule also brought about inferior planarity in whole molecule, then the molecules of L can organize through intermolecular interactions to form tiny crystals at nanosacle in water-medium solutions. The AIEE character of L was effectively applied in bioimaging of HepG2 cancer cells.

AB Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) thin films were non-reactively deposited onto glass and ITO coated glass substrates by RF magnetron sputtering using a LiNbO3 target in an argon (Ar) atmosphere at room temperature. The deposition power was 75 W during the deposition process. The optical and electrochromic properties of the LiNbO3 films with various thicknesses were investigated. Coloration efficiencies and optical modulations of the LiNbO3 films were investigated for the visible and near infrared region. The amount of inserted/extracted charges into/from the films during the bleaching/coloring process were obtained. The ion conducting and ion storing capabilities of the films were also investigated in detail. The LiNbO3 film deposited at 20 mTorr with a thickness of 110 nm had both highest optical modulation (20.3%) and coloration efficiency (19.3 cm(2)/C) at 550 nm. The LiNbO3 film was used in a unique design all-solid-state electrochromic device. Dry lithiation of the WO3 film was performed by exposing the film in vacuum to Li vapor atoms, which are given off by RF magnetron sputtering of LiNbO3. An all-solid-state electrochromic device with a configuration of ITO / NiO / Ta2O5 / dry lithiated WO3 / ITO / glass was fabricated and studied for its electrochromic behavior using a dry-lithiated WO3 film as an EC layer and an ion source. The optical modulation of the device was 31.4% at 550 nm for the applied potentials of +/- 2 V.

ID WAVE-GUIDE; NANOPARTICLES; MODES
AB Plasmonic Fano resonances are investigated in a coupled metasurface consisting of gold nanobars arranged in L-shaped fashion. The destructive interference between different modes supported by bright and dark nanobars leads to the emergence of sharp asymmetric Fano profile in the extinction spectrum. Multiple Fano resonances in the near-infrared regime are excited by arranging the L-shaped nanostructure in different ways. Furthermore, by increasing the index of refraction of the fill dielectric material around the nanoparticle surface, the Fano resonances exhibit a remarkable red-shift due to which high sensitivity of up to 1360 nm/RIU, figure of merit of 29, and contrast ratio of 66% are realized. These features make the proposed design a promising candidate for efficient bio-chemical sensing.

AB Background: Familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome, hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type-III) is a rare genetic disease caused by impaired development of sensory and afferent autonomic nerves. As a consequence, patients develop neurogenic dysphagia with frequent aspiration, chronic lung disease, and chemoreflex failure leading to severe sleep disordered breathing. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory disorders in familial dysautonomia.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review to summarize the evidence related to our questions. When evidence was not sufficient, we used data from the New York University Familial Dysautonomia Patient Registry, a database containing ongoing prospective comprehensive clinical data from 670 cases. The evidence was summarized and discussed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts. Evidence-based and expert recommendations were then formulated, written, and graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.
   Results: Recommendations were formulated for or against specific diagnostic tests and clinical interventions. Diagnostic tests reviewed included radiological evaluation, dysphagia evaluation, gastroesophageal evaluation, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, pulmonary function tests, laryngoscopy and polysomnography. Clinical interventions and therapies reviewed included prevention and management of aspiration, airway mucus clearance and chest physical therapy, viral respiratory infections, precautions during high altitude or air-flight travel, non-invasive ventilation during sleep, antibiotic therapy, steroid therapy, oxygen therapy, gastrostomy tube placement, Nissen fundoplication surgery, scoliosis surgery, tracheostomy and lung lobectomy.
   Conclusions: Expert recommendations for the diagnosis and management of respiratory disease in patients with familial dysautonomia are provided. Frequent reassessment and updating will be needed.

AB Background: Reducing the probability of future exacerbations is one of the main goals of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in COPD. Recent studies identified predictors of future exacerbations. However, PR might alter both predictors and number of exacerbations.
   Objectives: This secondary analysis examined which predictors assessed at both the beginning and the end of PR predict the risk of moderate (i. e. use of cortisone and/or antibiotics) and severe (hospitalization) exacerbations in the year after PR.
   Methods: A total of n= 383 COPD patients (34.7% female, mean age= 57.8 years (SD= 7.1), mean FEV1% pred= 51.0 (SD= 14.9)) who attended a 3- week inpatient PR were included. Number of moderate and severe exacerbations were assessed one year after PR (T2) via questionnaires. Potential predictors were assessed at the beginning (T0) and the end (T1) of PR. Negative binomial regression models were used.
   Results: The mean numbers of severe (M-s)/moderate (Mm) exacerbations in the year after PR (M-s,M- t2= 0.19; Mm, t2= 1.07) was reduced compared to the numbers of exacerbations in the year before PR (M-s,M- t1= 0.50, p < 0.001; M-m,M-t1= 1.21, p= 0.051). Previous exacerbations, retirement, change in dyspnea (for severe exacerbations) and dyspnea at T1 (for moderate exacerbations) were identified as significant predictors.
   Conclusions: PR might alter associations between predictors and future exacerbations. Dyspnea at the end of PR or change in dyspnea are better predictors than dyspnea at the beginning of PR.

   Procedures: We analyzed data from 4593 patients who underwent pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry testing. We assessed the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) before and after the administration of an inhaled short-acting beta(2)-agonist. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: bronchodilation, no significant change and paradoxical bronchoconstriction.
   Main findings: When assessing response to bronchodilators, 201 (4.4%) patients demonstrated significant bronchoconstriction, whereas 849 (18.5%) showed bronchodilation. The majority (3543 or 77.1%) had no significant change. There were no significant relationships noted between paradoxical bronchoconstriction and sex, race/ethnicity or body mass index.
   Conclusions: A significant subset of patients experience paradoxical bronchoconstriction after albuterol administration. Further research to better understand the clinical implications of paradoxical acute bronchoconstriction is needed.

AB Background: Chronic Refractory Cough (CRC) is a common condition that significantly impairs patients' quality of life. Unfortunately, in many situations patients continue to experience CRC in spite of following published guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.
   Methods: 99 patients were referred to National Jewish Health (NJH), a specialty respiratory center for evaluation of CRC (cough= 8 weeks duration). Study duration occurred over 18 months. Intake evaluation for all patients included history, physical examination, spirometry and fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Testing to confirm causes of CRC were performed. Specific therapy for each potential cause was provided. A visual analog cough scale measured cough response.
   Results: Ten final diagnostic categories were found in the cohort of 99 patients with CRC: Obstructive sleep apnea (apnea/hypoxia index= 5), rhinosinusitis, Tracheobronchomalacia (= 65% collapse of airway with dynamic expiratory imaging), esophageal dysmotility, gastroesophageal reflux, abnormal swallowing with laryngeal penetration, asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis and paradoxical vocal cord movement. In these patients there were 42 incorrect intake diagnoses and 101 new diagnoses established. Patients with CRC have had multiple diagnoses (3.8 +/- 1.6) associated with chronic cough. With directed therapy 71/76 (93%) patients had resolution or improvement in cough symptoms.
   Conclusions: Among patients referred to a specialty respiratory center with CRC multiple concomitant diagnoses for cough were common. Certain diagnoses such as OSA and TBM have not been reported in cough guidelines but in this study are commonly associated diagnoses. Targeted therapy for each recognized diagnosis improves patient response.

AB Background: A variety of different fixed-dose combinations of inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting beta(2)-agonists (ICS/LABA) are available for the treatment of asthma. The aim of this 24-week, open-label, multicenter, Phase IIIb randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI; 100/25 or 200/25 mu g) compared with twice-daily fixed combinations of ICS/LABA (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol [FP/S] and budesonide/formoterol [BUD/F]) as maintenance therapy in patients with uncontrolled asthma treated with ICS alone.
   Methods: Adult patients with documented physician-diagnosed asthma >= 1 year with an Asthma Control Test (ACT) score >= 15 and < 20 were included. The primary study endpoint was change from baseline in ACT total score at Week 12.
   Results: Overall, 423 patients were randomized to receive study medication in France and Germany. The leastsquares mean change (standard error) in ACT total score at Week 12 was 3.6 units with FF/VI and 2.8 with usual ICS/LABA, giving a treatment difference of 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.1, 1.5; p= 0.033). Non-inferiority of FF/VI to usual ICS/LABA was confirmed at Weeks 6, 18 and 24. The observed safety profile for FF/VI in this study was in line with previous experience with FF/VI.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that, in a tightly controlled randomized controlled trial setting, once-daily FF/VI provides similar asthma control over 24 weeks to usual, twice-daily ICS/LABA in patients with asthma that is uncontrolled on ICS alone. FF/VI was well tolerated.

AB Notable progress has been made in the past years in the classification, diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis. New criteria were proposed by the Working Group of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) for the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The latest classification of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) suggested by the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) has become widely accepted among clinicians. Subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is now considered a type of CPA, yet it is still diagnosed and treated similarly to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Isavuconazole, an extended-spectrum triazole, has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of IPA. The most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines strongly recommend reducing mold exposure to patients at high risk for pulmonary aspergillosis. The excessive relapse rate following discontinuation of therapy remains a common reality to all forms of this semi-continuous spectrum of diseases. This highlights the need to continuously reassess patients and individualize therapy accordingly. Thus far, the duration of therapy and the frequency of follow-up have to be well characterized.

AB Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common comorbidity in bronchiectasis, and is often associated with poorer outcomes. The cause and effect relationship between GORD and bronchiectasis has not yet been fully elucidated and a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of the interaction and potential therapies is required. This review explores the underlying pathophysiology of GORD, its clinical presentation, risk factors, commonly applied diagnostic tools, and a detailed synthesis of original articles evaluating the prevalence of GORD, its influence on disease severity and current management strategies within the context of bronchiectasis. The prevalence of GORD in bronchiectasis ranges from 26% to 75%. Patients with co-existing bronchiectasis and GORD were found to have an increased mortality and increased bronchiectasis severity, manifest by increased symptoms, exacerbations, hospitalisations, radiological extent and chronic infection, with reduced pulmonary function and quality of life. The pathogenic role of Helicobacter pylori infection in bronchiectasis, perhaps via aspiration of gastric contents, also warrants further investigation. Our index of suspicion for GORD should remain high across the spectrum of disease severity in bronchiectasis. Identifying GORD in bronchiectasis patients may have important therapeutic and prognostic implications, although clinical trial evidence that treatment targeted at GORD can improve outcomes in bronchiectasis is currently lacking.

   CHILDREN; HEART; ACTIVATION; PRESSURE; DAMAGE; AGE
AB Objective: We aimed to provide a more precise estimate of the relationship between telomere length and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by systematically reviewing evidence.
   Method: We conducted a systematic electronic search in the databases of the PUBMED, PsycINFO, OVID (Medline), EMBASE and other resources (such as Google Scholar). The methodological quality of the articles was assessed according to the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-square test for Cochrane's Q statistic and I-squared. When heterogeneity was found to be reasonably high between studies, the random-effects model with the mean difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) was conducted using RevMan 5 software by using the inverse variance method (P < 0.05; chi-square test). By contrast, the fixed-effects model was carried out.
   Results: Eight eligible studies involving 2639 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Shortened telomere length was significantly associated with OSA with mean difference of -0.03 (95% CI: -0.06, -0.00; P = 0.003 with I-square of 85%). The results of subgroup analysis preformed by age and sample number suggested that shorter telomere length was significantly associated with OSA, with mean difference of -0.07 (95% CI: -0.07, -0.01; P = 0.005) for adult group and -0.04 (95% CI: -0.02, -0.06; P = 0.005) for large-sample studies.
   Conclusion: Compared to healthy people, individuals with OSA have shorter telomere lengths which implicates early intervention and timely treatment for preventing future adverse outcomes. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Although physical activity (PA) is associated with a reduction of a wide range of sleep problems, it remains uncertain whether complying with the international guidelines of 150 min of moderate to vigorous PA per week can reduce sleep problems in adults. This research investigated the relationship between compliance with the PA recommendations of the World Health Organization and sleep problems in 38 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Methods: Cross-sectional, community-based data from the World Health Survey were analyzed. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were undertaken to explore the relationship between PA levels using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and self-reported sleep problems (such as difficulties falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night or waking up too early in the morning) in the last 30 days.
   Results: Across 204,315 individuals (38.6 +/- 16.1 years; 49.3% males), the overall prevalence (95% CI) of low PA and sleep problems were 29.9% (29.1-30.8%) and 7.5% (7.2-7.9%), respectively. After adjusting for socio-demographics, obesity, chronic physical conditions, depression, and anxiety; not complying with PA recommendations was associated with higher odds for sleep problems overall [odds ratio (OR) = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.10-1.38] as well as across the entire age range: 18-34 years (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.02-1.57); 35-64 years (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.01-1.35); and age >= 65 years (OR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.11-1.76).
   Conclusions: Not complying with international PA recommendations is associated with higher odds of sleep problems, independently of depression and anxiety in LMICs. Future longitudinal and interventional studies are warranted to assess whether increasing PA levels may improve sleep problems in this setting. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The prevalence of obese children with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is increasing. Obesity and SDB are independent cardiovascular risk factors, of which arterial stiffness is an early sign. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), is a marker of arterial stiffness and central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) is a better predictor of cardiovascular outcome than peripheral blood pressure. Therefore, we aimed to determine PWV and cSBP in overweight/obese or normal weight children with sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and non-snoring normal weight controls.
   Methods: Children (3-18 y) with SDB (overweight/obese [BMI z-scores >= 1.04], n = 48; normal weight n = 44) referred for clinical assessment of SDB and normal weight non-snoring controls recruited from the community (n = 38) underwent overnight polysomnography. PWV was calculated using photoplethysmography. cSBP was calculated using applanation tonometry in a subset of children older than 8 y (n = 55) who had usable waveforms.
   Results: Overweight/obese SDB group had higher PWV (mean cm/s (95% CI); wake: 366 (355-380); sleep: 340 (324-357)), than the normal-weight SDB group (wake: 257 (247-267), p = 0.002; sleep: 255 (242-269), p = 0.005), and non-snoring controls (wake: 238 (226-249), p = 0.002; sleep: 235 (220 -250), p < 0.001). The normal-weight SDB group had higher PWV than controls (p = 0.03). Overweight/obese children with SDB had higher cSBP (105 (100-110) mmHg) compared with the normal weight children with SDB (96 (90-102)) and the non-snoring controls (97 (91-104); p < 0.05 for both).
   Conclusion: This study suggests that overweight/obesity substantially worsens the cardiovascular sequelae of SDB, highlighting the imperative to treat obesity and SDB in children early in order to reduce future cardiovascular disease risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Sleep duration may vary both interindividually and intraindividually over time. We aimed to identify night-sleep duration (NSD) trajectories among preschoolers and to study associated factors.
   Methods: NSD was collected within the French birth-cohort study EDEN at ages 2, 3, and 5-6 years through parental questionnaires, and were used to model NSD trajectories among 1205 children. Familial socioeconomic factors, maternal sociodemographic, health and lifestyle characteristics, as well as child health, lifestyle, and sleep characteristics at birth and/or at age two years were investigated in association with NSD using multinomial logistic regressions.
   Results: Five distinct NSD trajectories were identified: short (SS, <= 10 h, 4.9%), medium-low (MLS, <11 h, 47.8%), medium-high (MHS, 11.5 h, 37.2%), long (LS, >= 11.5 h, 4.5%) and changing (CS, ie, >= 11.5 h then <11 h, 5.6%) NSD trajectories. Multivariable analyses showed in particular that compared to the MHS trajectory factors associated with increased risk for the SS trajectory were male gender, first child, maternal age and working status, night-waking, parental presence when falling asleep, television-viewing duration, as well as both "Processed and fast foods" and the "Baby food" dietary patterns at age two years. Factors positively associated with the CS trajectory were maternal smoking, feeding at night, and the Processed and fast foods dietary pattern at age two years, whereas child's activity and emotionality scores at age one year were negatively associated.
   Conclusion: We identified distinct NSD trajectories among preschoolers and associated early life factors. Some of them may reflect less healthy lifestyles, providing cues for early multi-behavioral prevention interventions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aflatoxins, including aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) and M-1 (AFM(1)), are natural potent carcinogens produced by Aspergillus spp. These compounds, which can often be detected in dairy foods, can cause diseases in human beings. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in cytotoxicity, as well as methods for intervention, remain largely unexplored. For example, it is unclear whether lactoferrin (LF), a major antioxidant in milk, can inhibit the cytotoxicity of AFB(1) and AFM(1). In this study, we assessed AFB(1)- and AFM(1)-induced cell toxicity by measuring cell viability, membrane permeability, and genotoxicity, and then investigated the ability of LF to protect cells against AFB(1) and AFM(1). In Caco-2, HEK, Hep-G2, and SK-N-SH cells, 4 mu g/mL AFB(1) or AFM(1) significantly inhibited cell growth, increased the level of lactate dehydrogenase, induced genetic damage, and increased the levels of signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (p < 0.05). AFBi was more genotoxic than AFM(1) in all four cell lines, especially in Hep-G2. In Caco-2, Hep-G2, and SK-N-SH, incubation of AF-treated cells with 1000 mu g/mL LF significantly decreased cytotoxicity, oxidation level, DNA damage, and levels of ERK1/2 and JNK (p < 0.05). Our data demonstrate that AFBi or AFM(1) induced cytotoxicity and DNA damage in these four cell lines, and that LF alleviated toxicity by decreasing oxidative stress mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.

AB Many familiar Hymenoptera are brightly colored and can sting painfully thus, their threat and clinical importance may be exaggerated. Most stinging insects only sting to defend themselves or their colonies from predators. The clinical nature of Hymenoptera envenomations contrasts that of other venomous animals, including other arthropods, primarily because allergic reaction, not direct intoxication, is the usual main concern. This review focuses mainly on the clinical features of direct toxicity to Hymenoptera envenomations, which can induce a high incidence of acute renal failure, liver failure, multiple organ failures, and death. Toxic mass envenomations by honeybees usually entail many hundreds or more stings per victim. In contrast to honeybee toxic envenomations, hornet sting envenomations can be clinically threatening with only 20-200 stings needed to cause kidney and other organ failures. Many lethal envenomations by honeybees occur in rural areas in the New World and Africa and are not recorded or documented. In contrast, deaths by hornets occur mainly to Asia. The most frequent and important envenomating taxa are honeybees, hornets, yellowjacket wasps, paper wasps, fire ants, and jack jumper ants. Occasional envenomating taxa include bumblebees, bullet ants, harvester ants, solitary wasps, solitary bees, and various ants of lesser clinical importance. Envenomations by Hymenoptera usually can be avoided if one considers that bees, wasps and ants "view" us as potential threats or predators, and that with information about the biology of stinging Hymenoptera, humans can minimize adverse incidents.

AB Ciguatoxins (CTXs) are fish metabolism products and a result of biotransformation of precursor gambiertoxins produced, in the first instance, by benthic dinoflagellates Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa. Ciguatoxins are potent neurotoxins that selectively open voltage gated sodium channels in excitable cells causing the human food poisoning known as Ciguatera (CFP). Endemic from tropical areas in central Pacific and West Indian Ocean, and the Caribbean Sea, CTX may affect up to 500,000 people annually due to fish consumption. Their recent occurrence in European waters highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach of CTX research in order to better understand the diversity and transformation of microalgae products through food webs. This article intends to review available information on chemistry, toxicity, distribution and fate of known CTX compounds from a critical perspective to provide an overview of future trends and needs on ciguatera research.

AB With the threat of a post-antibiotic era looming, the search for new and effective antibiotics from novel sources is imperative. Not only has crude snake venom been shown to be effective, but specific components within the venoms, such as Phospholipase A(2)s and L-amino acid oxidases have been isolated and demonstrated to be effective as well. Despite numerous studies being completed on snake venoms, there is a heavy bias towards utilizing the venoms from the highly toxic Elapidae and Viperidae species. Very few studies have been conducted on the less toxic, but taxonomically more diverse, Colubridae. Furthermore, an extensive review of the literature examining the efficacy and potential specificity of these venoms has not been completed. Therefore, the aims of this study were to elucidate any similarities in snake venoms as well as investigate the efficacy of snake venom antimicrobial properties towards morphologically and metabolically diverse microbial classes and the prevalence of snake species with antimicrobial properties within each snake family. The results indicate that snake venoms and their isolated components are powerful antimicrobial agents but vary in efficacy towards different microbial classes. Furthermore, due to similarities in venom composition, and limited preliminary studies, the less toxic Colubridae family may be a fruitful area of research to find novel antimicrobial agents that are less harmful to humans.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of bush sophora root polysaccharide (BSRPS) on the aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced hepatotoxicity and to explore the underlying mechanisms. The primary chicken hepatocytes were used as the model in the present experiment. The results showed that AFB1 induced hepatotoxicity of chicken hepatocytes in a dose dependent manner as demonstrated by decreasing cell viability and increasing LDH activity, ALT and AST levels. AFB1 at 0.16 mu M significantly increased the levels of hepatic cytochrome P450 1A5 (CYP450 1A5) mRNA and malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased the activity and mRNA level of manganese superoxide dismutase(SOD2) and the glutathione peroxidases (GSH-Px) activity in the hepatocytes compared with the blank control. BSRPS at 8.93 mu M, 17.86 mu M, and 35.72 mu M supplementation could significantly reverse the above-mentioned changes induced by AFB1, and 17.86 mu M of BSRPS has the largest effects on protecting the AFB1-induced hepatocytes damage. Knock-down of SOD2 by SOD2-specific siRNA significantly eliminated the protective effects of BSRPS on AFB1-induced the increase of CYP450 IA5 mRNA levels and hepatotoxicity. These results suggested that the BSRPS has protective effects on AFB1-induced hepatotoxicity by down-regulating CYP450 1A5 mRNA level via up-regulating SOD2 expression in the primary chicken hepatocytes.

AB Honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom (HBV) represents an ideal model to study the role of particular venom components in allergic reactions in sensitized individuals as well as in the eusociality of Hymenoptera species. The aim of this study was to further characterize the HBV components C1q-like protein (C1q) and PDGF/VEGF-like factor 1 (PVF1). C1q and PVF1 were produced as recombinant proteins in insect cells. Their allergenic properties were examined by determining the level of specific IgE antibodies in the sera of HBV-allergic patients (n = 26) as well as by their capacity to activate patients' basophils (n = 11). Moreover, the transcript heterogeneity of PVF1 was analyzed. It could be demonstrated that at least three PVF1 variants are present in the venom gland, which all result from alternative splicing of one transcript. Additionally, recombinant C1q and PVF1 from Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells exhibited specific IgE reactivity with approximately 38.5% of sera of HBV-allergic patients. Interestingly, both proteins were unable to activate basophils of the patients, questioning their role in the context of clinically relevant sensitization. Recombinant C1q and PVF1 can build the basis for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Hymenoptera venoms. Moreover, the conflicting results between IgE sensitization and lack of basophil activation, might in the future contribute to the identification of factors that determine the allergenic potential of proteins.

AB The suggested link between beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and the onset of neurodegenerative diseases and the detection of this cyanotoxin in aquatic organisms has prompted research into the potential human exposure risk associated with sourcing food items from eutrophied water bodies worldwide. The Hartbeespoort Dam reservoir in the North West province of South Africa has persistent cyanobacterial blooms and is used extensively by anglers, many of whom consume their catch. The commercial sale of fish species harvested from this reservoir as part of a recent biomanipulative remediation strategy may pose an additional hazard. BMAA and Microcystins (MC) were detected in fish sourced from this reservoir. BMAA levels of up to 1630 ng g(-1) dry weight and MC concentrations of up to 29.44 ng g(-1) dry weight were detected in fish sourced during an extensive bloom episode, with a clear correlation between the total amount of BMAA detected in the fish muscle tissue and their relative position in the Hartbeespoort Dam reservoir food web. Interestingly, fish sourced from this reservoir in winter when dense cyanobacterial blooms were lacking contained BMAA levels of up to 3055 ng g(-1) dry weight. We also comment on the observed seasonal variations of BMAA levels in phytoplankton and fish sourced from this water body as well as the potential exposure risks associated with harvesting food items from this reservoir.

AB PhTx2 is the most toxic fraction from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, being responsible to sodium entry into cortical synaptosomes, increasing the release of neurotransmitters, such as L-glutamate (L-Glu) and; acetylcholine. In this study, we investigated the action of a toxin purified from; PhTx2 fraction, called PnTx2-6 or delta-CNTX-Pn2a, on L-Glu release from rat; brain cortex synaptosomes, as well as its ability to induce blood-brain barrier permeability. PnTx2-6 increased L-Glu release from rat cortical brain synaptosomes in a time- and dose dependent manner (EC50 = similar to 20 nM; Tm = 16min), as measured by a fluorimetric method. The increase of L-Glu by PnTx2-6 was inhibited by tetrodotoxin. And partially inhibited by EGTA. Calcium channel blockers omega-coconotoxin MVIIC (P/Q-types) and omega-conotoxin GVIA (N-type), were able to reduce the PnTx2-6-induced release of L-Glu, while nifedipine (L-type) did not show any inhibition. These findings suggest that thew release of L-Glu by PnTx2-6 is due its primary action on sodium channels, well-known to be target of this toxin. PnTx2-6 is able to potentiate penile erection and this effect may be related with the release of c-glutamate from the CNS, besides a local effect on corpus carvenosum, as previously shown by our group. If L-Glu release and penile erection potentiation are indeed correlated, then this toxin should be able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Results by immunoblotting assays indicated a change in the expression of proteins associated with the paracellular and transcellular transport at the blood-brain barrier, suggesting a BBB dysfunction mediated by PnTx2-6. Therefore, PnTx2-6 may induce the release L-glutamate in the central nervous system, when injected peripherally.

AB The growing world population is placing an increasing demand on food production. In addition, abuse and misuse of chemical insecticides has led to the evolution of resistance in insect pests as well as environmental damage. Together, these developments have created a demand for new insecticidal compounds to facilitate global food production. Arachnid venom peptides provide an environmentally-friendly alternative as potential bioinsecticides given their advantages of being fully biodegradable, highly potent, and phyletically selective. However, the use of arachnid venom peptides as bioinsecticides has been questioned due to their presumed lack of oral toxicity. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop screens for oral insecticidal activity. Based on the high susceptibility of dipterans to venom peptides, fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and sheep blowflies (Lucilia cuprina) were selected for screening 56 arachnid venoms. 71.4% of these venoms caused 50% or higher mortality in Drosophila, whereas 30.4% were lethal to blowflies at oral doses of 1 or 30 mu g/fly, respectively. We used these assays to compare the oral and injection activity of four well-known spider venom peptides (Hv1a, Hv1c, Dc1a and Ta1a). Hv1c and Ta1a only showed weak or no oral activity in both species, while Hv1a and Dc1a showed higher oral activity in blowflies than Drosophila. Overall, we have established screens for oral toxicity in two dipteran insects. Our results indicate that oral insecticidal activity is more widespread in arachnid venoms than expected, and that some arachnid venoms and venom peptides exhibit phyletic differences in oral toxicity.

AB Based on existing evidence for efficacy, savings, and advantages in delivery, some countries may elect to pilot or roll out single-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination (instead of, or in combination with, two-dose) in advance of a WHO policy decision. Accelerated evidence of population-based effectiveness (hereafter referred to as overall effectiveness, OE) of one-dose vaccine programs could be gained through regular surveys of HPV prevalence in young women before and after vaccination introduction. In order to offer the earliest information on OE, one-dose HPV vaccination should target one or more birth cohorts as close as possible to the age when sexual activity most often starts in a given population. A catch-up one dose vaccination program of girls up to 18 years of age who would have been too old to profit from the introduction of a routine HPV vaccination program in preadolescents would minimize the interval between vaccination and the possibility to monitor vaccination impact in young women. In addition, catch-up is especially desirable in low- and middle-income countries with little access to screening as "missed" cohorts may face high risk of cervical cancer death. HPV prevalence should be firstly monitored in age groups of women who may already be sexually active but still reluctant to admit it and to accept vaginal examination for the collection of cervical cells. Hence, HPV testing from urine samples, for which good concordance with cervical cells has been proven, offers a feasible approach to assess periodically vaccine OE in representative samples of 17-20 year-old women. This type of observational study would greatly benefit from the presence of a population census and the creation of a vaccination registry. A real world demonstration of OE of the new schedule would complement the findings of ongoing clinical trials and immunogenicity studies on the efficacy of single-dose HPV vaccination.

AB Background: Although guidelines for prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommend two doses for girls ages 9-14 years, several studies have demonstrated similar protection with one dose. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term health and economic impacts of routine one-dose HPV vaccination compared to (1) no vaccination and (2) two-dose HPV vaccination in a low-income country.
   Methods: We used a three-tiered hybrid modeling approach that captured HPV transmission, cervical carcinogenesis, and population demographics to project long-term health and economic outcomes associated with one-dose HPV vaccination (assuming 80% efficacy against HPV-16/18 infections under three waning scenarios) and two-dose HPV vaccination (assuming 100% efficacy over the lifetime) in Uganda. Costs included the vaccine program (dosage and delivery) costs over a 10-year period and cervical cancer costs over the lifetimes of the current population of Ugandan women. Health outcomes included number of cervical cancer cases and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., cost per DALY averted) were calculated and compared against the Ugandan per-capita gross domestic product.
   Results: Routine one-dose HPV vaccination of 9-year-old girls required substantial upfront investment but was cost-saving compared to no vaccination when accounting for the cost-offsets from future cancers averted. Forty years after initiating routine vaccination and depending on assumptions of vaccine waning, one-dose HPV vaccination with equivalent coverage (70%) averted 15-16% of cervical cancer cases versus 21% with two-dose vaccination but required only half the upfront economic investment. Vaccination with two doses had an attractive cost-effectiveness profile except if one-dose vaccination enabled higher coverage (90% vs. 70%) and did not wane.
   Conclusions: One-dose HPV vaccination resulted in cost-savings compared to no vaccination and could be cost-effective compared to two-dose vaccination if protection is longstanding and higher coverage can be achieved. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aquatic environment can contain numerous micropollutants and there are concerns about endocrine activity in environmental waters and the potential impacts on human and ecosystem health. In this study a complementary chemical analysis and in vitro bioassay approach was applied to evaluate endocrine activity in treated wastewater, surface water and drinking water samples from six countries (Germany, Australia, France, South Africa, the Netherlands and Spain). The bioassay test battery included assays indicative of seven endocrine pathways, while 58 different chemicals, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds, were analysed by targeted chemical analysis. Endocrine activity was below the limit of quantification for most water samples, with only two of six treated wastewater samples and two of six surface water samples exhibiting estrogenic, glucocorticoid, progestagenic and/or anti-mineralocorticoid activity above the limit of quantification. Based on available effect-based trigger values (EBT) for estrogenic and glucocorticoid activity, some of the wastewater and surface water samples were found to exceed the EBT, suggesting these environmental waters may pose a potential risk to ecosystem health. In contrast, the lack of bioassay activity and low detected chemical concentrations in the drinking water samples do not suggest a risk to human endocrine health, with all samples below the relevant EBTs.

AB Alcohols such as ethanol (EtOH) and tert-butanol (TBA) are frequently used as quenching agents to identify the primary radical species in the persulfate (PS)-based oxidation processes. However, the contribution of alcohol radicals (ARs) to contaminant degradation in this process has rarely been assessed. In this study, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), phenol, and carbon tetrachloride were selected as probes to test the role of ARs in the thermally activated PS system. It was found that the degradation rates of these compounds were largely depended on their reactivities with ARs and the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the reaction system. In the PS/alcohol system, TCA was degraded efficiently under anaerobic conditions, while it was hardly degraded in the presence of oxygen. The results of electron paramagnetic resonance, reducing radical quenching studies, and the analysis of PS consumption suggested that ARs were the dominant reactive species contributing to TCA degradation in the PS/EtOH system under anaerobic conditions. Further studies indicated that ARs could significantly degrade CCl4 through dechlorination but not phenol. CCl4 was also degraded efficiently by ARs when oxygen in the reaction solution was completely consumed by ARs. This study highlights the important role of alcohol radicals in the degradation of contaminants during quenching studies in PS-activated processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microcystins are the most commonly occurring cyanotoxins, and have been extensively studied across the globe. In the present study, a strongly basic anion exchange resin was employed to investigate the removal of Microcystin-LR (MCLR), one of the most toxic microcystin variants. Factors influencing the uptake behavior included the MCLR and resin concentrations, resin dosage, and natural organic matter (NOM) characteristics, specifically, the charge density and molecular weight distribution of source water NOM. Equivalent background concentration (EBC) was employed to evaluate the competitive uptake between NOM and MCLR. The experimental data were compared with different mathematical and physical models and pore diffusion was determined as the rate-limiting step. The resin dose/solute concentration ratio played a key role in the MCLR uptake process and MCLR removal was attributed primarily to electrostatic attractions. Charge density and molecular weight distribution of the background NOM fractions played a major role in MCLR removal at lower resin dosages (200 mg/L similar to 1 mL/L and below), where a competitive uptake was observed due to the limited exchange sites. Further, evidences of pore blockage and site reduction were also observed in the presence of humics and larger molecular weight organic fractions, where a four-fold reduction in the MCLR uptake was observed. Comparable results were obtained for laboratory studies on synthetic laboratory water and surface water under similar conditions. Given their excellent performance and low cost, anion exchange resins are expected to present promising potentials for applications involving the removal of removal of algal toxins and NOM from surface waters.

AB Tire wear particles (TWP), generated from tire material during use on roads have gained increasing attention as part of organic particulate contaminants, such as microplastic, in aquatic environments. The available information on properties and generation of TWP, analytical techniques to determine TWP, emissions, occurrence and behavior and ecotoxicological effects of TWP are reviewed with a focus on surface water as a potential receptor. TWP emissions are traffic related and contribute 5-30% to non exhaust emissions from traffic. The mass of TWP generated is estimated at 1,327,000 t/a for the European Union, 1,120,000 t/a for the United States and 133,000 tea for Germany. For Germany, this is equivalent to four times the amount of pesticides used. The mass of TWP ultimately entering the aquatic environment strongly depends on the extent of collection and treatment of road runoff, which is highly variable. For the German highways it is estimated that up to 11,000 t/a of TWP reach surface waters. Data on TWP concentrations in the environment, including surface waters are fragmentary, which is also due to the lack of suitable analytical methods for their determination. Information on TWP properties such as density and size distribution are missing; this hampers assessing the fate of TWP in the aquatic environment. Effects in the aquatic environment may stem from TWP itself or from compounds released from TWP. It is concluded that reliable knowledge on transport mechanism to surface waters, concentrations in surface waters and sediments, effects of aging, environmental half-lives of TWP as well as effects on aquatic organisms are missing. These aspects need to be addressed to allow for the assessment of risk of TWP in an aquatic environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LA English
DT Article
DE Legionella; Reclaimed water; Risk assessment
ID LEGIONNAIRES-DISEASE; PNEUMOPHILA
AB Legionella pneumophila has been detected in reclaimed water used for spray irrigation of turfgrass in public parks and golf courses. This study determined the risks of infection from exposure to various levels of Legionella in reclaimed waters considering: the method of spray application: and the duration and frequency of exposure. Evaluation of these factors resulted in a risk of infection greater than 1:10,000 for several scenarios when the number of Legionella in the reclaimed water exceeded 1000 colony forming units (CFU) per ml. Most current guidelines for control of Legionella in distribution systems recommend that increased monitoring or remedial action be taken when Legionella levels exceed 1000 to 10,000 CFU/ml. Based upon our risk assessment, these guidelines seem appropriate for reclaimed water systems where spray irrigation is practiced. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last century, nutrient concentrations in streams, rivers, lakes and ponds have increased substantially in the United States. Elevated phosphorus levels are a concern due to their ability to cause changes in freshwater ecosystems that are detrimental to humans and wildlife. In the present study, long-term trends in total phosphorus (TP) concentrations from 20 rivers in central Massachusetts from 1999 to 2013 were investigated. Kendall's correlation coefficients were used to demonstrate that 18 of the 20 rivers had significant reductions in TP concentrations (P < 0.05). A similar trend was found when flow-adjusted TP concentrations were analyzed. At the beginning of monitoring activities, the average TP concentration in 9 of the 20 rivers was greater than 0.05 mg/L and 6 of these 9 rivers contained TP concentrations greater than 0.1 mg/L; about fifteen years later, only 3 rivers contained TP greater than 0.05 mg/L and none had concentrations> 0.1 mg/L. TP decreases were greater in rivers with more anthropogenic inputs. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the decline of TP in these Massachusetts streams is likely the result of advancements in wastewater treatment and implementation of effective non-point source management practices.

AB This study provides an overview of established processes as well as recent progress in emerging technologies for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In addition to a discussion of major reaction mechanisms and formation of by-products, data on energy efficiency were collected in an extensive analysis of studies reported in the peer-reviewed literature enabling a critical comparison of various established and emerging AOPs based on electrical energy per order (E-EC) values. Despite strong variations within reviewed EEC values, significant differences could be observed between three groups of AOPs: (1) O-3 (often considered as AOP-like process), O-3/H2O2, O-3/UV, UV/H2O2, UV/persulfate, UV/chlorine, and electron beam represent median EEC values of <1 kWh/m(3), while median energy consumption by (2) photo-Fenton, plasma, and electrolytic AOPs were significantly higher (EEC values in the range of 1-100 kWh/m(3)). (3) UV-based photocatalysis, ultrasound, and microwave-based AOPs are characterized by median values of >100 kWh/m(3) and were therefore considered as not (yet) energy efficient AOPs. Specific evaluation of 147 data points for the UV/H2O2 process revealed strong effects of operational conditions on reported E-EC values. Besides water type and quality, a major influence was observed for process capacity (lab-vs. pilot-vs. full-scale applications) and, in case of UV-based processes, of the lamp type. However, due to the contribution of other factors, correlation of E-EO values with specific water quality parameters such as UV absorbance and dissolved organic carbon were not substantial. Also, correlations between E-EC and compound reactivity with OH-radicals were not significant (photolytically active compounds were not considered). Based on these findings, recommendations regarding the use of the E-EC concept, including the upscaling of laboratory results, were derived. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) are often controlled by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) which manage their operation and maintain a reliable water supply. As such, and with the cyber layer becoming a central component of WDS operations, these systems are at a greater risk of being subjected to cyberattacks. This paper offers a model-based methodology based on a detailed hydraulic understanding of WDSs combined with an anomaly detection algorithm for the identification of complex cyberattacks that cannot be fully identified by hydraulically based rules alone. The results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving the best-known performance when tested on the data published in the BATtle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms (BATADAL) competition (http://www.batadal.net).

AB A win-win strategy by the integration of wastewater treatment with value-added products production through a vertical-algal-biofilm enhanced raceway was investigated in the present study. Raceway pond was enhanced by vertically setting the biofilm in the system with a certain interval distance that could be adjusted for different light conditions and wastewater types. Two types of synthetic wastewater were treated with suitability-proven materials as biofilm carriers under four operation distances. Composition of the harvested algal biomass was analyzed. Coral velvet with 5-8 mm length villus was the optimal carrier, since it was durable and with high biomass productivity (6.95-8.11 gm(-2)center dot day(-1)). Nutrients in the wastewaters were efficiently removed with the COD, TN and TP reduction of over 86.61%, 73.68% and 89.85%, respectively. Wastewater with the low nutrients concentration experienced lower biomass and lipid productivity but larger biodiesel productivity and higher nutrient removal efficiency. In addition, as the operation distance increased, wastewater treatment efficiency was first increased but then decreased, while algal biomass footprint production was decreased. Differences in nutrients removal efficiencies were mainly due to the distance difference, which caused different biofilm culture surface areas and light regimes. The optimal operation distance as a function of the efficient nutrient removal and biodiesel production in this study was 6 cm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of ozone-biologically activated carbon (O-3-BAC) treatment with various phosphate doses (0, 0.3 or 0.6 mg/L) were investigated on the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) and occurrence of opportunistic pathogens (OPs) in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) simulated by annular reactors (ARs). It was found that the lowest DBPs and the highest inactivation of OPs such as Mycobacterium spp., Mycobacterium avium, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Hartrnanella vermiformis, occurred in the effluent of the AR with 0.6 mg/L phosphate addition. Based on the results of different characterization techniques, for the AR with 0.6 mg/L phosphate-enhanced O-3-BAC treatment, dissolved organic carbon in the influent exhibited the lowest concentration and most stable fraction due to the improved biodegradation effect. Moreover, the total amount of suspended extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the bulk water of the AR decreased greatly, resulting in the lowest chlorine consumption and DBPs formation in the AR. In Fourier transform infrared spectra of the suspended EPS, the amide II band (1600-1500 cm(-1)) disappeared and the protein/polysaccharide ratio decreased remarkably, indicating the destruction of protein and a decrease in hydrophobicity. Moreover, n-sheets and a helices in the protein secondary structures were degraded while the random coils increased sharply as phosphate addition increased to 0.6 mg/L, inhibiting microbial aggregation and hence weakening the chlorine-resistance capability. Thus, most of the OPs in suspended biofllms were more easily inactivated by residual chlorine, resulting in the lowest OPs occurrence in the effluent of the AR. Our findings indicated that enhancing the efficiency of the BAC filter by adding phosphate is a promising method for improving water quality in DWDSs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in the environment has attracted great attention as it has become a global concern. This review aims to systematically demonstrate the role of marine microplastic as a novel medium for environmental partitioning of chemicals in the ocean, which can cause toxic effects in the ecological environment. This review assimilated and analyzed available data published between 1972 and 2017 on the interaction between MPs and selected chemicals. Firstly, the review analyzes the occurrence of chemicals in MPs and outlines their distribution patterns. Then possible mechanisms of the interaction between MPs and organic chemicals and potential controlling factors were critically studied. Finally, the hazards of MPs and affiliated organic chemicals to marine organisms were shortly summarized. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Co(II)/peroxymonosulfate (Co(II)/PMS) process, producing sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-), effectively removes organic pollutants in water, while producing a significant amount of bromate (BrO3-) in the presence of bromide (Br). This paper investigates the ammonia (NH3) addition, chlorine-ammonia (Cl-2-NH3) and ammonia-chlorine (NH3-Cl-2) pretreatment strategies in controlling BrO3- formation in 20 min in the Co(II)/PMS process at pH 4.0. The addition of NH3 retarded the BrO3- formation, but only at a reduction level of about 9.5% for NH3 concentration of 50 mu M, and was mainly attributed to the protonation of NH3 at pH 4 (99.99% as NH4+, did not react with HOBr). Both the Cl-2-NH3 and NH3-Cl-2 pretreatment strategies at HOCI and NH3 dosages of 15 and 50 mu M, respectively, reduced 95% or more of the overall BrO3- formation and retarded the BrO3- formation, with the NH3-Cl-2 pretreatment strategy outperforming Cl2NH3. The reduction of the BrO3- formation was mainly attributed to the formation of monochloramine (NH2Cl) in both pretreatment strategies. NH2Cl effectively outcompetes SO4 center dot- to react with HOBr and forms NHBrCI, with the apparent reaction rate constant between NH2Cl and HOBr more than 100 times faster than that between Sal and HOBr. However, the oxidation/degradation of NHBrCI in the Co(II)/PMS process reforms HOBr, and, although less in quantity, is oxidized to BrO3- at higher Co(II) and Br- concentrations. Thus, the NH3-Cl-2 and Cl-2-NH3 pretreatment strategies inhibit the BrO3- formation more significantly at lower Co(II) and Br- concentrations. In all cases, the generation of SO4 center dot- in 20 min was not affected by the implementation of the three BrO3- pretreatment strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The complete methanogenic degradation of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was achieved in this study. Initially, DMF was found to be feebly degradable by a lab-scale submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAnMBR) using normal anaerobic digestion sludge (ADS) even after 120-day's culturing. However, aerobic DMF-degrading activated sludge (AS) was rapidly cultivated in a continuous aeration reactor (CAR). A specially designed anaerobic co-cultured sludge (ACS) made by artificially mixing AS with ADS was successfully domesticated by a long term repeated batch experiment. The results demonstrated that ACS could effectively degrade over 5000 mg L-1 DMF for methane recovery. The metabolic pathway and stoichiometric equation of DMF methanogenic degradation were also revealed and verified in detail. It was confirmed that under the anaerobic condition, with the help of enzyme, DMF converts into dimethylamine and formic acid, and the intermediates are effectively fermented through methylotrophic/hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Analysis of the microbial community suggested that some facultatively anaerobic bacteria played the key roles in methanogenic degradation due to their DMF-hydrolyzing ability. By co-culturing two sources of inoculum under the anaerobic condition, the symbiosis of facultatively anaerobic DMF-hydrolyzing bacteria and methylotrophic/hydrogenotrophic methanogens makes methanogenic degradation of DMF available. This study also provides a novel sludge cultivation method for anaerobic treatment of degradation-resistant organics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When reclaimed water is used as municipal miscellaneous water, acute exposure of the generated aerosol with high levels of endotoxins can cause severe inflammation in the lungs. However, the potential risks of long-term inhalation of reclaimed water remains unclear. To identify the adverse effects of sub-chronic reclaimed water inhalation and explain the underlying mechanisms, a mouse model of 12-week sub-chronic exposure was established, and wastewater before a membrane bioreactor (MBR, positive control) and the MBR effluent (reclaimed water, which met the quality standard of urban use and was currently used for landscape irrigation) were tested in this study. The exposure dose was set to approach the real working scenarios. Lung lavage and histology were analyzed. Obvious epithelial cell apoptosis in the bronchi was observed, along with the accumulation of myofibroblasts and the collagen deposition both in main bronchi and terminal bronchioles. All these symptoms were persistent after 4 weeks of recovery. Inflammation and induced bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (iBALT) were also observed but diminished after recovery indicating inflammation may not be the direct cause of the symptom. Furthermore, two fibrogenic cytokines (TNF-alpha and TGF-beta) were constantly high in the lung during the study. They might be the biomarkers of lung damage after the inhalation of reclaimed water. Adaptive immune responses were also detected as elevated levels of IgG and IgA, but not for IgE. Inhalation of reclaimed water causes sustained fibrotic lesions in the lungs, which suggests potential health risks during urban application where aerosols generated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of chemical pollutants in sources of drinking water is a key environmental problem threatening public health. Efficient removal of pollutants in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) is needed as well as methods for assessment of the total impact of all present chemicals on water quality. In the present study we have analyzed the bioactivity of water samples from source to tap, including effects of various water treatments in a DWTP, using a battery of cell-based bioassays, covering health-relevant endpoints. Reporter gene assays were used to analyze receptor activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) and induction of oxidative stress by the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). DNA damage was determined by Comet assay. Grab water samples were concentrated by HLB or ENV solid phase extraction and the water samples assayed at a relative enrichment factor of 50. The enrichment procedure did not induce any bioactivity. No bioactivity was detected in Milli-Q water or drinking water control samples. Induction of AhR, ER and Nrf2 activities was revealed in source to tap water samples. No cytotoxicity, PPAR alpha or AR antagonist activity, or DNA damage were observed in any of the water samples. A low AR agonist activity was detected in a few samples of surface water, but not in the samples from the DWTP. The treatment steps at the DWTP, coagulation, granulated activated carbon filtration, UV disinfection and NH2CI dosing had little or no effect on the AhR, Nrf2 and ER bioactivity. However, nano filtration and passage through the distribution network drastically decreased AhR activity, while the effect on Nrf2 activity was more modest and no apparent effect was observed on ER activity. The present results suggest that bioassays are useful tools for evaluation of the efficiency of different treatment steps in DWTPs in reducing toxic activities. Bioassays of AhR and Nrf2 are useful for screening of effects of a broad range of chemicals in drinking water and ER activity can be monitored with a high sensitivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Both nanoparticulate (nZnO and nTiO(2)) and organic chemical ultraviolet (UV) filters are active ingredients in sunscreen and protect against skin cancer, but limited research exists on the environmental effects of sunscreen release into aquatic systems. To examine the trade-offs of incorporating nano particles (NPs) into sunscreens over the past two decades, we targeted endpoints sensitive to the potential risks of different UV filters: solar reactive oxygen production in water and disruption of zebrafish embryo development. First, we developed methodology to extract nanoparticles from sunscreens with organic solvents. Zebrafish embryos exposed to parts-per-million NPs used in sunscreens displayed limited toxicological effects; nZnO particles appeared to be slightly more toxic than nTiO(2) at the highest concentrations. In contrast, seven organic UV filters did not affect zebrafish embryogenesis at or near aqueous solubility. Second, to simulate potent photo-initiated reactions upon release into water, we examined methylene blue (MB) degradation under UV light. nTiO(2) from sunscreen caused 10 times faster MB loss than nZnO and approached the photocatalytic degradation rate of a commercial nTiO(2) photo catalysts (P25). Organic UV filters did not cause measurable MB degradation. Finally, we estimated that between 1 and 10 ppm of sunscreen NPs in surface waters could produce similar steady state hydroxyl radical concentrations as naturally occurring fluvic acids under sunlight irradiation. Incorporation of NPs into sunscreen may increase environmental concentrations of reactive oxygen, albeit to a limited extent, which can influence transformation of dissolved substances and potentially affect ecosystem processes.

AB Electrolysis combined with biochar (BC) was used in a constructed wetland to intensify nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal from wastewater simultaneously. A pilot study was conducted using an electrolysis-integrated, BC-amended, horizontal, subsurface-flow, constructed wetland (E-BHFCW). The research results showed that both electrolysis and BC substrate played important roles in the intensified, constructed wetland. The electrolysis combined BC substrate greatly enhanced the removal rates of nitrate (49.54%) and P (74.25%) when the E-BHFCW operated under the lower current density of 0.02 mA/cm(2) and an electrolysis time of 24 h. Improved N removal was accomplished with the electrochemical denitrification of iron cathodes; the autotrophic denitrification bacteria appeared to remove nitrate which was adsorbed on the BC substrate because hydrogen gas was produced by cathodes in the E-BHFCW. Less nitrate was taken directly by wetland plants and microbes. The in-situ formation of ferric ions from a sacrificial iron anode, causing P chemical sedimentation and physical adsorption, improved P removal. BC, modified by iron ions from an iron anode to adsorb the nitrate and P, was a good material to improve effluent water quality. It can also serve as a favorable microbial carrier to bio-transform nitrate to N gas. This is because there were abundant and diverse bacterial communities in the biofilm on the BC substrate in the E-BHFCW. Thus, electrolysis integrated with BC in a constructed wetland is a novel, feasible and effective technique for enhancing wastewater N and P removal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The formation and transportation processes of non-point source (NPS) pollution varied among the studied watersheds in the Northeastern China, so we hypothesized that the driving force behind NPS pollution followed the spatial scale effect. With a watershed outlet sedimentary flux analysis and a distributed NPS pollution loading model, we investigated the temporal dynamics of NPS and the differences in driving forces. Sediment core samples were collected from two adjacent watersheds, the smaller Abujiao watershed and the larger Naoli watershed. The natural climatic conditions, long-term variations in the distribution of land use, soil properties and tillage practices were the same in the two watersheds. The vertical distributions of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, Zn and As at 1-cm intervals in the section showed clear differences between the watersheds. There were higher concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the larger watershed, but the heavy metals were more concentrated in the smaller watershed. Lead-210 (Pb-210) analyses and the constant rate of supply model provided a dated sedimentary flux, which was correlated with the corresponding yearly loading of NPS total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the two watersheds. The total phosphorus showed a stable relationship in both watersheds with an R-2 value that ranged from 0.503 to 0.682. A rose figure comparison also demonstrated that the pollutant flux in the sediment was very different in the two watersheds, which had similar territorial conditions and different hydrological patterns. Redundancy analysis further indicated that expanding paddy areas had a large impact on the sedimentary flux of nitrogen and phosphorus in the smaller watershed, but precipitation had a direct impact on NPS loading in the larger watershed. We concluded that the spatial scale effect affected the NPS pollution via the transport processes in the waterway, which was mainly influenced by branch length and drainage density.

AB Membrane distillation (MD) is a rapidly emerging water treatment technology; however, membrane pore wetting is a primary barrier to widespread industrial use of MD. The primary causes of membrane wetting are exceedance of liquid entry pressure and membrane fouling. Developments in membrane design and the use of pretreatment have provided significant advancement toward wetting prevention in membrane distillation, but further progress is needed. In this study, a broad review is carried out on wetting incidence in membrane distillation processes. Based on this perspective, the study describes the wetting mechanisms, wetting causes, and wetting detection methods, as well as hydrophobicity measurements of MD membranes. This review discusses current understanding and areas for future investigation on the influence of operating conditions, MD configuration, and membrane non-wettability characteristics on wetting phenomena. Additionally, the review highlights mathematical wetting models and several approaches to wetting control, such as membrane fabrication and modification, as well as techniques for membrane restoration in MD. The literature shows that inorganic scaling and organic fouling are the main causes of membrane wetting. The regeneration of wetting MD membranes is found to be challenging and the obtained results are usually not favorable. Several pretreatment processes are found to inhibit membrane wetting by removing the wetting agents from the feed solution. Various advanced membrane designs are considered to bring membrane surface non-wettability to the states of superhydrophobicity and superomniphobicity; however, these methods commonly demand complex fabrication processes or high-specialized equipment. Recharging air in the feed to maintain protective air layers on the membrane surface has proven to be very effective to prevent wetting, but such techniques are immature and in need of significant research on design, optimization, and pilot-scale studies.

AB The fouling of ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes during the treatment of surface waters continues to be of concern and the particular role of natural organic matter (NOM) requires further investigation. In this study the effect of pH and surface charge on membrane fouling during the treatment of samples of a representative surface water (Hyde Park recreational lake) were evaluated, together with the impact of pre-ozonation. While biopolymers in the surface water could be removed by the UF membrane, smaller molecular weight (MW) fractions of NOM were poorly removed, confirming the importance of membrane pore size. For NF membranes the removal of smaller MW fractions (800 Da -10 kDa) was less than expected from their pore size; however, nearly all of the hydrophobic, humic-type substances could be removed by the hydrophilic NF membranes for all MW distributions (greater than 90%). The results indicated the importance of the charge and hydrophilic nature of the NOM. Thus, the hydrophilic NF membrane could remove the hydrophobic organic matter, but not the hydrophilic substances. Increasing charge effects (more negative zeta potentials) with increasing solution pH were found to enhance organics removal and reduce fouling (flux decline), most likely through greater membrane surface repulsion. Pre-ozonation of the surface water increased the hydrophilic fraction and anionic charge of NOM and altered their size distributions. This resulted in a decreased fouling (less flux decline) for the UF and smaller pore NF, but a slight increase in fouling for the larger pore NF. The differences in the NF behavior are believed to relate to the relative sizes of ozonated organic fractions and the NF pores; a similar size of ozonated organic fractions and the NF pores causes significant membrane fouling.

AB The present study proposed and demonstrated a novel process for the bioconversion of syngas (mainly CO and H-2) to valuable volatile fatty acids (VFA) by integrating with mesophilic alkaline fermentation of waste activated sludge (WAS). The results showed that although pH 9 was suitable for VFA production from WAS, 62.5% of the consumed CO was converted to methane due to the presence of hydrogenogenic pathway for CO conversion. The increase of pH from 9 to 9.5 inhibited the methane production from CO because of the possible presence of only acetogenic pathway for CO conversion. However, methane was still produced from H-2 contained in syngas through hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, and around 32-34% of the consumed syngas was converted to methane. At both pH 9 and 9.5, methane was produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanobacteriales. Further increase of pH to 10 effectively inhibited methane production from syngas, and efficient VFA (mainly acetate with the concentration of around 135 mM) production by simultaneous conversion of syngas and WAS was achieved. High acetate concentrations (> 150 mM) were shown to have serious negative effects on the conversion of syngas. The addition of syngas to the mesophilic alkaline fermentation of WAS at pH 10 not only resulted in the enrichment of some known bacteria related with syngas conversion, but also changed the microbial community compositions for the fermentation of WAS.

AB Rivers are among the most sensitive of all ecosystems to the effects of global change, but options to prevent, mitigate or restore ecosystem damage are still inadequately understood. Riparian buffers are widely advocated as a cost-effective option to manage impacts, but empirical evidence is yet to identify ideal riparian features (e.g. width, length and density) which enhance ecological integrity and protect ecosystem services in the face of catchment-scale stressors. Here, we use an extensive literature review to synthesise evidence on riparian buffer and catchment management effects on instream environmental conditions (e.g. nutrients, fine sediments, organic matter), river organisms and ecosystem functions. We offer a conceptual model of the mechanisms through which catchment or riparian management might impact streams either positively or negatively. The model distinguishes scale-independent benefits (shade, thermal damping, organic matter and large wood inputs) that arise from riparian buffer management at any scale from scale-dependent benefits (nutrient or fine sediment retention) that reflect stressor conditions at broader (sub-catchment to catchment) scales. The latter require concerted management efforts over equally large domains of scale (e.g. riparian buffers combined with nutrient restrictions). The evidence of the relationships between riparian configuration (width, length, zonation, density) and scale-independent benefits is consistent, suggesting a high certainty of the effects. In contrast, scale-dependent effects as well as the biological responses to riparian management are more uncertain, suggesting that ongoing diffuse pollution (nutrients, sediments), but also sources of variability (e.g. hydrology, climate) at broader scales may interfere with the effects of local riparian management. Without concerted management across relevant scales, full biological recovery of damaged lotic ecosystems is unlikely. There is, nevertheless, sufficient evidence that the benefits of riparian buffers outweigh potential adverse effects, in particular if located in the upstream part of the stream network. This supports the use of riparian restoration as a no-regrets management option to improve and sustain lotic ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study was to develop predictive models of the ecological status of rivers by using artificial neural networks. The relationships between five macrophyte indices and the combined impact of water pollution as well as hydromorphological degradation were examined. The dataset consisted of hydro morphologically modified rivers representing a wide water quality gradient. Three ecological status indices, namely the Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR), the Macrophyte Biological Index for Rivers (IBMR) and the River Macrophyte Nutrient Index (RMNI), were tested. Moreover two diversity indices, species richness (N) and the Simpson index (D) were tested. Physico-chemical parameters reflecting both water quality and hydromorphological status were utilized as explanatory variables for the artificial neural networks. The best modelling quality in terms of high values of coefficients of determination and low values of the normalized root mean square error was obtained for the RMNI and the MIR networks. The networks constructed for IBMR, species richness and the Simpson index showed a lower degree of fit. In all cases, modelling quality improved by adding two hydromorphological indices to the pool of explanatory variables. The significant effect of these indices in the models was confirmed by sensitivity analysis. The research showed that ecological assessment of rivers based on macrophyte metrics does not only reflect the water quality but also the hydromorphological status. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of secreted extracellular phenazine compounds (PHCs) on the degradation efficiency of alkanes by P. aeruginosa NY3. Under aerobic conditions, the PHCs secreted by P. aeruginosa NY3 initiate the oxidation of alkanes outside cells, in coupling with some reducing agents, such as beta-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced disodium salt (NADH) or reduced glutathione (GSH). This reaction might be via free radical reactions similar to Fenton Oxidation Reaction (FOR). P. aeruginosa NY3 secretes pyocyanin (Pyo), 1-hydroxyphenazine (HPE), phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), and phenazine-1-amide (PCN) simultaneously. The cell-free extracellular fluid containing these four PHCs degrades hexadecane effectively. The observation of Electron Spin Resonance (EPR) signals of superoxide anion radical (center dot O-2(-)), hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and/or carbon free radicals (center dot R) both in vivo and in vitro suggested the degradation of hexadecane could be via a free radical pathway. Secretion of PHCs has been found to be characteristic of Pseudomonas which is often involved in or related to the degradation of organic pollutants. Our work suggested that certain organic contaminants may be oxidized through ubiquitously extracellular abiotic degradation by the free radicals produced during bio-remediation and bio-treatment.

AB UV-vis differential spectroscopy was applied to characterize and quantify the spectral changes after ClO2 oxidation of ten humic substances, seven aromatic model compounds and four surface waters. The differential spectra of ten humic substances after ClO2 oxidation all exhibited a peak near 230 nm and a broad absorbance band with a maximum at around 316 nm. The differential spectra after ClO2 oxidation were distinguished from the one after chlorination, which was indicative of their different oxidation mechanisms. The differential spectra after ClO2 treatment were well fitted by seven Gaussian bands with maxima at about 200, 225, 240, 276, 316, 385 and 457 nm. Differential absorbance at 316 nm and 400 nm (denoted as DA(316) and DA(400), respectively) were found to best quantify the degradation of organic matters during ClO2 oxidation with negligible interferences from water matrixes. Oxidation of substituted functional groups on aromatic structures, rather than destruction of aromatic rings, was more responsible for chlorite formation. Spectral parameters DA(316) and DA(400) showed strong correlations with ClO2 consumption and chlorite formation during ClO2 oxidation of humic substances and surface water samples. The results demonstrate that DA(316) and DA(400) can serve as promising indicators of chlorite formation and ClO2 consumption, which provide a practical approach for online water quality monitoring during ClO2 water purification.

AB Wastewater treatment ecotechnologies such as constructed wetlands and denitrifying bioreactors are commonly perceived as robust and resilient to shock loading, but this has proved difficult to quantify, particularly when comparing different systems. This study proposes a method of quantifying and comparing performance resilience in response to a standard disturbance. In a side-by-side study we compare the treatment performance of four different configurations of wetlands and denitrifying bioreactors subjected to hydraulic shock loads of five times the standard inflow rate of primary treated sewage for five days. The systems consist of: horizontal-flow gravel-bed wetlands (HG); single pass vertical-flow sand or gravel media wetlands followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors (VS + C and VG + C respectively); and a recirculating anoxic attached-growth bioreactor and vertical sand media wetland followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors (R(A + VS)+C). Resilience was quantified for Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Five-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) and Total Nitrogen (TN) by time integration of Relative Disturbance in Performance relative to pre-shock loading performance (days equivalent Performance Reduction), and by the Recovery Time after shock loading ceased. The quantification method allowed an unbiased comparison of the four different systems. It highlighted important differences in the resilience for different removal mechanisms associated with the configuration of the wetlands/bioreactor systems. Relative Disturbances in Performance were expressed in comparison to percent daily removal under standard loading, and, for the different pollutants were equivalent to loss of between 0.08 and 2.51 days of removal capacity. Average Recovery Times ranged from zero to three days, with all systems exhibiting substantial recovery even during the five-day shock loading period. This study demonstrated that both the horizontal gravel wetland and the vertical flow wetland systems combined with carbonaceous bioreactors tested are generally resilient to shock loading of five times hydraulic and organic loading for periods of up to five days. Standard quantification of performance resilience to shock loadings or other perturbations has potential application across a wide range of technologies and research fields. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The development of stereotaxy can be dated back 100 years. However, most stereotactic neurosurgery still relies on the workflow established about half a century ago. With the arrival of computer-assisted navigation, numerous studies to improve the neurosurgical technique have been reported, leading to frameless and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided/verified techniques. Frameless stereotaxy has been proved to be comparable to frame-based stereotaxy in accuracy, diagnostic yield, morbidity, and mortality. The incorporation of intra-operative MRI guidance in frameless techniques is considered an appealing method that could simplify workflow by reducing coregistration errors in different imaging modalities, conducting general anesthesia, and monitoring the surgical progress. In light of this situation, manually operated platforms have emerged for MRI-guided frameless procedures. However, these procedures could still be complicated and time-consuming because of the intensive manual operation required. To further simplify the procedure and enhance accuracy, robotics was introduced. Robots have superior capabilities over humans in certain tasks, especially those that are limited by space, accuracy demanding, intensive, and tedious. Clinical benefits have been shown in the recent surge of robot-assisted surgical interventions. We review the state-of-the-art intra-operative MRI-guided robotic platforms for stereotactic neurosurgery. To improve the surgical workflow and achieve greater clinical penetration, 3 key enabling techniques are proposed with emphasis on their current status, limitations, and future trends.

AB BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is classified as a chronic inflammatory seronegative rheumatic arthritis. Patients with AS are more likely to sustain a fracture of the cervical spine compared with the general population. Most fractures occur in the lower cervical spine and manifest at the level of the intervertebral disc. There have been few reports about the surgical treatment for upper cervical spine fractures in patients with AS, especially odontoid fractures. We present 3 cases of odontoid fracture in patients with long-standing AS.
   METHODS: Odontoid fracture with atlantoaxial displacement was identified on radiologic imaging in 3 patients. In 1 patient, fracture was a missed diagnosis after initial trauma, and the fracture and displacement were discovered 3 months later owing to aggravation of symptoms. Posterior occipitocervical fusion with iliac autograft was performed under general anesthesia in all cases.
   RESULTS: All 3 patients recovered postoperatively without any complications related to surgery. Cervical radiographs obtained at 12-month follow-up demonstrated healed fracture and replacement of the atlantoaxial joint.
   CONCLUSIONS: Odontoid fracture with atlantoaxial dislocation in patients with long-standing AS is uncommon. Clinicians must be cautious in assessing such patients with any episode of trauma. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in demonstrating occult odontoid fractures. Posterior occipitocervical fusion with internal fixation may benefit these patients, although at the cost of sacrificing the last motion segment.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to comprehensively compare the clinical and biomechanical efficiency of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with anterior cervical disc replacement (ACDR) for treatment of multilevel cervical disc disease using a meta-analysis and systematical review.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for articles published between January 1960 and December 2017. Both clinical and biomechanical parameters were analyzed. Statistical tests were conducted by Revman 5.3. Nineteen studies including 10 clinical studies and 9 biomechanical studies were filtered out.
   RESULTS: The pooled results for clinical efficiency showed that no significant difference was observed in blood loss (P = 0.09; mean difference [MD], 7.38; confidence interval [CI], -1.16 to 15.91), hospital stay (P = 0.33; MD, -0.25; CI, -0.76 to 0.26), Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores (P = 0.63; MD, -0.11; CI, -0.57 to 0.34), visual analog scale (P = 0.08; MD, -0.50; CI, -1.06 to 0.05), and Neck Disability Index (P = 0.33; MD, -0.55; CI, -1.65 to 0.56) between the 2 groups. Compared with ACDF, ACDR did show increased surgical time (P = 0.03; MD, 31.42; CI, 2.71-60.14). On the other hand, ACDR showed increased index range of motion (ROM) (P < 0.00001; MD, 13.83; CI, 9.28-18.39), lower rates of adjacent segment disease (ASD) (P = 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 0.27; CI, 0.13-0.59), complications (P = 0.006; OR, 0.62; CI, 0.45-0.87), and rate of subsequent surgery (P < 0.00001; OR, 0.25; CI, 0.14-0.44). As for biomechanical performance, ACDR maintained index ROM and avoided compensation in adjacent ROM and tissue pressure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel ACDR may be an effective and safe alternative to ACDF in terms of clinical and biomechanical performance. However, further multicenter and prospective studies should be conducted to obtain a stronger and more reliable conclusion.

AB During the archaeological excavations conducted in the Hellenistic necropolis discovered in Messina (Sicily, Italy) dating back to the 3rd century BC., a skeleton showing evidence of cranial traumas and surgical intervention was found. The skull, belonging to a young adult male, presented signs of 4 head injuries produced by both blunt and sharp-edged instruments. The first 2 lesions, located on the frontal bone, were produced by blunt blows and showed signs of long-term survival. The third lesion, located on the inferior portion of the right parietal, suggests a perimortem nonpenetrating linear cut likely caused by a blade instrument. Finally, a rectangular bone loss is visible on the left parietal bone, involving the full cranial thickness with well-delimited cutting edges and no sign of a reparative process. This injury can be interpreted as the result of a trepanation, performed with the technique defined as "linear cutting" and obtained through 4 linear incisions in parallel pairs intersecting at the right angles. The trepanation is likely related to the multiple head injuries exhibited by the patient, who unfortunately did not survive the surgical intervention. Trepanation in Italy has been largely attested since Prehistoric times, but the case from Messina represents the first evidence of neurosurgical intervention performed through the linear cutting technique in the Italian context and the second case in the whole of Europe. This technique might have been imported in Sicily during the Hellenistic period from the Near East, where it is clearly attested.

AB INTRODUCTION: Persistent trigeminal artery is the most frequent embryonic communication between the vertebrobasilar and carotid systems. To the best of our knowledge, posttraumatic trigeminal-cavernous fistula is rarely reported in the literature.
   CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 47-year-old man with posttraumatic trigeminal-cavernous fistula, which we treated using Onyx embolization.
   CONCLUSION: Even though preservation of the parent artery is generally considered a desirable goal in fistula treatment, in special cases such as Salzmann type 2 anatomy plus a unique fistulous orifice accompanied by external carotid-cavernous fistula, it is required to embolize the persistent trigeminal artery and cavernous sinus.

ID STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; CHEMOTHERAPY; RADIOTHERAPY; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Tumors of the pineal region are rare in adulthood, accounting for approximately 1% of intracranial neoplasms in this age range. Because of their rarity, it has proven to be difficult to establish the optimal therapy. Furthermore, microsurgical total resection in this eloquent location is associated with not low rates of morbidity.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe 2 patients diagnosed with papillary tumors of the pineal region by stereotactic biopsy and referred for Gamma Knife radiosurgery after shunting for hydrocephalus. We report a long-term follow- up of 15 and 20 years, respectively, showing a good response to the treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: After a diagnosis of papillary tumors of the pineal region, radiosurgery is an alternative treatment, with high local control and low morbidity.

AB OBJECTIVE: Retention of nonabsorbable hemostatic materials (RNHMs), that is, retained surgical sponge, gauzoma, gossypiboma, muslinoma, or textiloma, is a rarely seen surgical complication after spinal surgery that may remain asymptomatic for many years and may represent a diagnostic difficulty with associated medicolegal implications.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the English- language literature published between 1965 and 2017, accessed through 4 popular databases. We found a total of 37 articles (24 case reports; 7 image presentations; 5 clinical series, and 1 letter to editor) containing 58 cases of RNHMs located within the spinal canal or around the spinal column after surgery.
   RESULTS: In this study, there were 29 female and 29 male patients from 13 countries, ages ranging from 17 years to 87 years, with initial diagnoses of lumbar or cervical disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or spondylolisthesis (n = 54), or spinal tumor (n = 4). The interval from the initial surgery to the presentation of RNHMs ranged from 13 days to 40 years, with a mean of 75.9 months. Various imaging techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were used with histologic study, confirming the presence of RNHMs in the majority of patients with a complete recovery resulting in 93% of patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: RNHMs is an overreported entity in underdeveloped or developing countries, including Turkey and Morocco, with progression occurring over years. RNHMs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with back pain, spinal cord, or nerve roots symptomatology after spinal surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinicoradiologic condition encountered in many different clinical settings; it generally occurs in the context of hypertensive crisis, immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune diseases. It is characterized by headache, stupor, seizures, and visual alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging findings include white matter changes preferentially in the parieto-occipital regions. Although pathogenesis is not fully elucidated, vasoconstriction and brain hypoperfusion seem to be the cause of brain ischemia and vasogenic edema. Cerebrospinal fluid hypotension is also a reported plausible pathogenic mechanism.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of PRES following laminectomy and fixation for L4-5 lumbar stenosis and spondylolisthesis. The patient presented with status epilepticus immediately after surgery that lasted 5 days. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed fluid attenuated inversion recovery and T2 hyperintensities in the bilateral parietal and occipital lobes and external capsules. On the basis of postoperative lumbar images, we hypothesized that an unnoticed cerebrospinal fluid leak might have contributed to development of PRES. The patient developed multiple postoperative complications but ultimately recovered after treatment for severe hypertension and seizures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prompt recognition and treatment of this potentially life-threatening syndrome is necessary to increase the likelihood of favorable outcome. Spinal surgeons need to be aware of the possibility of neurologic deterioration after spinal surgery and be alert about the occurrence of a dural leak, either recognized or unnoticed, as the plausible mechanism triggering PRES.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Arachnoid cyst; Sarcoidosis; Vertigo
ID OF-THE-LITERATURE
AB BACKGROUND: Arachnoid cysts are a relatively common finding in adult patients, especially with the advent of advanced imaging techniques. The overall incidence ranges from 1%-2%, and the majority are clinically silent. Arachnoid cysts are postulated to arise by congenital anomalies or trauma. De novo formation of arachnoid cysts has been reported but is exceptionally rare and mostly found in the pediatric population after head trauma. There have only been 2 reported cases of symptomatic de novo arachnoid cyst formation in adult patients to date, both with histories of head trauma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 71-year-old male patient with progressive vertigo who had previous brain magnetic resonance imaging studies without abnormalities. Another MRI was performed 3 years from the last study that showed interval development of a large cystic lesion compressing the right cervicomedullary junction, as well as radiologic evidence of neurosarcoidosis. Intraoperative findings showed a cystic mass with clear, gelatinous fluid. The cyst was drained, and the walls were resected and sent to pathology. Histopathologic testing confirmed the lesion was an arachnoid cyst. The patient's vertiginous symptoms improved after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case represents the first incidence of a pathologyproven, nontraumatic de novo arachnoid cyst.

ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; OF-THE-LITERATURE; FRONTAL-LOBE
AB BACKGOUND: In this study, we report a case of solitary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) without skull or systemic lesions including reviewing the initial magnetic resonance (MR) findings of cerebral LCH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old male patient presented with generalized tonic-clonic type seizure. Brain MR imaging showed a 3-cm mass lesion involving the right frontal lobe. It showed isointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. After gadolinium enhancement, the mass showed heterogeneous enhancement with perilesional edema and additional adjacent leptomeningeal enhancement. Special MR techniques focused on the enhanced lesion showed increased cerebral blood volume on perfusion images, no diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted images, and a necrotic spectrum on MR spectroscopy. At surgery, we found a yellow mass and yellow tissue debris in the sulci adjacent to the mass and removed them. The final histopathologic diagnosis was LCH in the frontal lobe. The patient underwent scheduled adjuvant chemotherapy with cytarabine for 6 months and has been regularly followed up without any neurologic problem for 3 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, additional sulcal enhancement around the mass lesion might be a clue MR imaging feature of intracerebral LCH, and special MR imaging techniques such as perfusion imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and MR spectroscopy could be helpful in differential diagnosis.

   extradural cyst
ID THORACOLUMBAR SPINE; MENINGEAL CYSTS
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal extradural cyst (SEDC) accounts for <1% of spinal epidural lesions. It is commonly asymptomatic but can give rise to back pain and compressive neurologic symptoms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 51-year-old male who presented with gait difficulties over 5 months associated with occasional urge incontinence. Clinical examination revealed signs suggestive of thoracic myelopathy with bilateral lower limbs spasticity, decreased proprioception, and pinprick sensation. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a thoracic(T) 7-T9 extradural cystic lesion with an area of flow void on the right side between T8 and T9. A right hemilaminotomy was initially performed, and the dural defect was identified and repaired primarily. Unfortunately, there was a recurrence of the SEDC 2 weeks post operation and a T7-T9 laminoplasty with a complete excision was performed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography myelography or magnetic resonance imaging flow study best visualizes the communication between the epidural cyst and subarachnoid space. The ideal surgical management for SEDC remains controversial. Our case suggests that there may be higher recurrence associated with fenestration of the SEDC and closure of the dural defect, but perhaps higher complications associated with complete excision. We present a case report and literature review of the terminology, presentation, recommended investigations, management, and outcomes of patients with SEDC.

ID LATERAL SKULL BASE; NAVIGATION; SURGERY
AB Over the past 30 years, the application of robotics in the field of neurotology has grown. Robots are able to perform increasingly complex tasks with ever improving accuracy, allowing them to be used in a broad array of applications. A mastoidectomy, in which a drill is used to remove a portion of the mastoid part of the temporal bone at the base of the skull, is one such application. To determine the current state of neurotologic robotics in the specific context of mastoidectomy, a review of the literature was carried out. This qualitative review explores what has been done in this field to date, as well as what has yet to be done. Although the research suggests that robotics can be and has been successfully used to assist with mastoidectomy, it also suggests the incompleteness of robotic development in the field. At present, only 2 robotic systems have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for neurosurgical use and the literature lacks evidence of meaningful clinical testing of new systems to change that. The cost of robotics also remains prohibitive. However, strides have been made, with at least 1 robot for mastoidectomy having reached the point of cadaveric trials. In addition, the research suggests some of the characteristics that should be considered when designing robots for mastoidectomy, such as burr size and the type of forces that should be applied. Overall, the outlook for robots in neurotology, particularly mastoidectomy, is bright but some hurdles still remain to be overcome.

   INSERTION
AB OBJECTIVE: Various computer-based guidance systems have been devised to reduce costly screw-related complications, yet their clinical effectiveness has never been comparatively assessed in a meta-analysis. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of clinically relevant pedicle screw revisions among robot-guided, navigated, and freehand spinal instrumentation.
   METHODS: Controlled trials comparing robot-guided, navigated, or freehand spinal instrumentation for any indication and that specifically reported the proportion of patients who experienced pedicle screw revisions were included. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Sensitivity analyses including zero-event trials and assessing per screw incidences were carried out.
   RESULTS: Among 37 studies (7095 patients), intraoperative revisions in robot-guided (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-19.4; P [0.14) and navigated (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.3-7.2; P [0.64) procedures were comparable to freehand. Although postoperative revisions were reduced in robot-guided (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P [0.04) and navigated (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.5; P < 0.001) procedures, statistical significance was lost in sensitivity analyses for robotic guidance, but not for navigation. The pooled incidence of malpositioned screws requiring postoperative revision was 2.1%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available data in the peer-reviewed literature, computer assistance in the form of robotic guidance or navigation has the potential to reduce the incidence of costly and clinically relevant postoperative revisions for screw malposition. It is essential to further investigate on a higher level of evidence if the clinical benefits of computer assistance warrant the high acquisition and maintenance costs inherent to these systems.

AB INTRODUCTION: The S2 alar-iliac (S2AI) screw is a modification of the traditional iliac fixation technique and has surgical and biomechanical benefits. However, there are significant regional neurovascular structures along the path of such screws. Therefore the current anatomic study was performed to better elucidate these relationships.
   METHODS: Using fluoroscopy, S2AI screws were placed in 2 adult cadavers through a standard posterior midline exposure. The screw insertion point was placed 10 mm lateral to a line bisecting the S1 and S2 foramina, adjacent to the sacroiliac joint. Using 30- to 40-degree lateral angulation from the midline and 20- to 30-degree caudal angulation, a pedicle probe was directed toward the anterior inferior iliac spine. The final trajectory was positioned to sit 1-2 cm superior to the greater sciatic foramen.
   Lastly, the screws and surrounding bone were drilled in order to visualize both lateral and medial neurovascular relationships.
   RESULTS: Removing the bone around the S2AI-screw illustrated the close relationship to the medial (internal) neurovascular structures including the obturator nerve, lumbosacral trunk, sacral plexus and, specifically, the S1 ventral ramus and iliac vein and artery. By removing the outer cortex of the ilium, the close relationship to the superior gluteal artery, vein, and nerve was observed. In addition, we were able to identify the proximity to the iliopsoas muscle and internal iliac vessels.
   CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive knowledge of the surrounding neurovascular anatomy relevant to S2AI screw placement can decrease patient morbidity and allow spine surgeons to better diagnose potential postoperative complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Substantial clinical benefit (SCB) represents a threshold above which patients recognize substantial improvement and represents a rational target for defining clinical success. In adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery, previous fusions may impact outcomes after deformity correction.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of previous spinal fusion on the likelihood of reaching SCB thresholds for 2-year health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after ASD surgery.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review comparing baseline demographic, HRQOL, and radiographic features for patients with ASD undergoing primary versus revision procedures. The primary outcome measure was reaching SCB threshold in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS), and back and leg pain (numeric rating scale). Secondary outcomes included absolute and change scores in ODI, PCS, and back and leg pain.
   RESULTS: In total, 332 patients achieved 2-year follow-up (228 primary; 104 revision cases). Those undergoing revision surgery had similar demographic features (age 58.3/55.9, female 80.8%/82.9%) to patients undergoing primary surgery. They had worse baseline HRQOL (ODI 48.5/41.2, PCS 29.5/33.4, back 7.5/7.0, and leg pain 4.9/4.3; P < 0.001) and radiographic deformity (sagittal vertical axis 111.4/451, lumbopelvic mismatch 26.7/11.0, pelvic tilt 29.5/21.0; P < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the number of patients who reached SCB for ODI (38.3/36.3%), PCS (48.5/53.4%), hack (53.1/60.5%), and leg pain numeric rating scale (28.6/36.9%) did not significantly differ. Revision patients had worse 2-year HRQOL for all measures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing revision surgery have worse baseline HRQOL and deformity. Although they do not achieve the same absolute level of 2-year HRQOL outcome, they have a similar likelihood of reaching SCB threshold for improvement in 2-year HRQOL.

TI Value of Routine Preoperative Tests for Coagulation Before Elective
   Cranial Surgery. Results of an Institutional Audit and a Nationwide
   Survey of Neurosurgical Centers in Pakistan

DT Article

ID INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; POSTOPERATIVE HEMORRHAGE; RISK-FACTORS;
   THERAPY; ANTICOAGULATION
AB BACKGROUND: Routine preoperative blood testing has become a dogma. The general practice is to order preoperative workup as a knee-jerk response rather than individualize it for each patient. The fact that the bleeding brain tends to swell, which coupled with limited options for proximal control, packing, and overall hemostasis, leads to an overemphasis on the preoperative coagulation profile.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of the medical records of patients admitted at Aga Khan University Hospital from January 2010 to December 2015 for an elective craniotomy. The hospital registry was used to identify files for review. Data were collected on a predefined proforma. A nationwide survey was performed, and 30 neurosurgery centers were contacted across Pakistan to confirm the practice of preoperative workup.
   RESULTS: The survey revealed that all centers had a similar practice of preoperative workup. This included complete blood count, serum electrolytes, and coagulation profile, including prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). A total of 1800 files were reviewed. Nine (0.5%) patients were found to have deranged clotting profile without any predictive history of clotting derangement; 56% were male and 44% were female. Median age was 32 years with an interquartile range of 27 years. Median aPTT was (40.8 with 20.8 IQR). Median INR was (1.59 with 0.48 IQR). Median blood loss was (400 with 50 IQR). No significant association between coagulation profile (aPTT, INR) and blood loss was found (P = 0.85, r = -0.07).
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients without a history of coagulopathy and normal physical examination do not require routine coagulation screening before elective craniotomy.

AB BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is widely used to treat brain pathologies alone or in concert with other treatment modalities. However, there are some side effects, such as radiation injury characterized by edema and necrosis in peripheral tissues, that must be managed. A new treatment agent against this side effect is bevacizumab, which targets increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a prominent etiologic factor in radiation injury. In this study, we created a rat experimental model to describe the effects of both radiation and the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab following high-dose SRS, and to compare the effects of prophylactic and delayed-onset bevacizumab treatment.
   METHODS: Fifty-four adult male Wistar rats were allocated into 9 groups based on differing Gamma-knife surgery (GKS) doses and bevacizumab treatment protocols. After 12 weeks, the rats' right frontal lobes were examined with hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohisto-chemistry analysis via VEGF and CD31 antibodies.
   RESULTS: Radiation necrosis occurred to varying degrees in all irradiated animals between 3 and 10 weeks post-SRS. Higher GKS dose (50% isodose of 100 Gy) led earlier necrosis and prophylaxis of bevacizumab at this dose was associated with delayed onset of necrosis. Moreover, prophylactic bevacizumab mitigated the effects of radiation necrosis following GKS at both doses, whereas this effect was not prominent with late initiation of bevacizumab (treatment protocol).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the onset and degree of radiation injury are affected by the GKS dose and protocol of bevacizumab administration.

AB BACKGROUND: Spondylotic cervical myelopathy (SCM) is d common cause of spinal-related disability in elderly patients. The assessment of this disability is a challenging task and depends on the subjective evaluation of the investigator. As a widespread-used scale, the modified version of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (mJOA) should be translated and culturally adapted in the Brazilian Portuguese language (i.e., mJOA-Br) to provide its clinical and research use. This study aimed to perform translation, transcultural adaptation, and validation of the mJOA into Brazilian Portuguese.
   METHODS: Following the transcultural adaptation model described by Guillemin et al., the scale as translated into Brazilian Portuguese and back-translated to English. Afterwards, questionnaires were applied in consecutive patients with SCM and compared with a control group (without SCM). The final scale was compared with the Brazilian version of Neck Disability Index for validation.
   RESULTS: Sixty patients were submitted to the trans-4d version of mJOA. There was a strong correlation between mJOA-Br scores and Neck Disability Index scores to evaluate SCM symptoms (R = - 0.75).
   CONCLUSIONS: mJOA-Br was considered a valid and reliable tool to evaluate patients with SCM.

TI Use of EOS Low-Dose Biplanar X-Ray for Shunt Series in Children with
   Hydrocephalus? A Preliminary Study
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE EOS biplanar X-ray; Hydrocephalus; Low-dose; Radiation; Shunt series
ID ADOLESCENT PATIENTS; CANCER-RISK
AB INTRODUCTION: Shunt series (SS) are a common diagnostic tool used to verify shunt integrity. SS include X-ray films of the skull, chest, and abdomen and often are performed either when a shunted patient presents with suspected shunt malfunction or as a screening test to identify shunt disconnections or dislodgment. EOS low-dose biplanar X-rays are associated with significantly reduced radiation doses compared with ordinary X-rays and are used for various indications. This is the first publication on the use of EOS as a SS technique.
   METHODS: Over a period of 6 months, EOS were performed our center for various orthopedic indications, mostly for scoliosis evaluation. Nine children (<20 years of age) had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and served as the study group. We retrospectively reviewed shunt visibility and integrity in the EOS scans as well as regular SS or plain spinal X-rays.
   RESULTS: Three patients had bilateral shunts, and 8 had 3 previous X-rays for comparison. In all patients, the shunt integrity was easily demonstrated on the EOS images. Two patients had an identified shunt disconnection confirmed on the EOS images. No shunt-related information was missed on the EOS compared with the other X-ray images.
   CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that EOS may be used as an alternative technology to demonstrate shunt integrity instead of regular X-ray SS. Favorable shunt visibility without the need for multiple radiation exposures and image processing (such as stitching) results in a significantly shorter examination time and significant less radiation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To summarize the characteristics of intracranial pseudoaneurysms (IPAs) in pediatric patients.
   METHODS: Pediatric IPAs treated at our center between January 2012 and April 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Related literature was reviewed, and the results of those studies were compared with our present findings.
   RESULTS: A total of 15 pediatric IPAs from 64 pediatric intracranial aneurysms (23.4%) were included in our study. Eleven of the 15 patients (73.3%) were male, and 9 (60%) had a history of head trauma. Seven patients (46.6%) presented with seizures, 9 of 11 patients (81.8%) with ruptured aneurysms with presented intracerebral hematoma, and 9 IPAs (60%) were large or giant in size. The internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) were the most common aneurysm sites (n = 6; 40.0%). Eight IPAs (53.3%) were distal arterial aneurysms. Seven patients (46.7%) underwent craniotomy surgery, and 8 (53.3%) underwent endovascular treatment. During a mean follow-up of 2.0 +/- 1.3 years, 12 patients (80.0%) had favorable outcomes, with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. One patient in the endovascular group died due to postoperative rebleeding.
   CONCLUSIONS: IPAs are prevalent among all pediatric intracranial aneurysms, and head trauma is the most important risk factor. IPAs present with more intracerebral hematomas, tend to be larger, and are commonly observed in the ICA, MCA, and distal arterial location; they also carry a high risk of seizures. Both surgical and endovascular treatment could achieve favorable clinical outcomes, but more studies are needed to reveal which treatment approaches are best suited for pediatric IPAs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Muscle injury is inevitable during surgical exposure of the spine. This study compared paraspinal muscle injury after 4 surgical techniques: microdiscectomy (MD), percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD), percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID), unilateral biportal endoscopic discectomy (UBED).
   METHODS: Eighty patients who underwent MD, PELD, PEID, and UBED were prospectively observed. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and C-reactive protein levels were measured on admission and postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7. CPK ratio was calculated as CPK on postoperative day 1/CPK on admission. Cross-sectional area of the high-intensity lesion in the paraspinal muscle was measured on magnetic resonance imaging after surgery. Operative time and hospital stay duration were also examined. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the visual analog scale for back and leg pain.
   RESULTS: MD group had the highest CPK levels on postoperative days 1 and 3 and CPK ratio (P < 0.01, P = 0.02, P = 0.04). Serial C-reactive protein levels were highest in MD group (P < 0.01). PELD and PEID groups had lower C-reactive protein level on postoperative day 1 than UBED group. MD group had largest cross-sectional area (P< 0.01). Cross-sectional area was larger in UBED group than in PELD and PEID groups (P< 0.01). Operative time and hospital stay duration were shortest in PELD group (P< 0.01, P< 0.01). MD group had significantly higher visual analog scale scores for back pain on postoperative days 1 and 3 than the other groups (P< 0.01, P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: PELD is the least invasive spinal surgical technique.

AB BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated outcomes after elective lumbar spinal surgery in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This review investigated the impact of HIV-positive status (without AIDS) on outcomes after elective lumbar fusion for degenerative disc disease (DDD).
   METHODS: Adult patients registered in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2011) undergoing elective lumbar fusion for DDD were extracted. Multivariable regression techniques were used to explore the association of HIV positivity with outcomes after lumbar fusion.
   RESULTS: This cohort included 612,000 hospitalizations (0.07% were HIV positive) of lumbar fusion for DDD. Compared with HIV-negative patients undergoing lumbar fusion, HIV-positive patients were younger (47 vs. 55 years), male (61% vs. 42%), largely insured by Medicare (30% vs. 5%), and had higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (23.7% vs. 14.6%) (all P < 0.001) but had lower rates of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes (all P < 0.001). Multivariable models demonstrated HIV positivity to be associated with higher odds for an adverse event (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; P < 0.001), in-hospital mortality (OR, 39.91; P < 0.001), wound complications (OR, 2.60; P = 0.004), respiratory (OR, 5.43; P < 0.001) and neurologic (OR, 1.96; P = 0.039) complications, and higher costs (7.1% higher; P = 0.011) compared with non-HIV patients. There were no differences in thromboembolic events, cardiac or gastrointestinal complications, discharge disposition, or length of stay.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even in this selected cohort of well-controlled HIV patients, there were high complications, with concerning rates of death and respiratory complications. These data shed new light on elective spine surgery in HIV patients and may influence the treatment algorithm of surgeons who are familiar with older papers.

AB BACKGROUND: The goal of surgery for brain glioma is to maximize the extent of tumor resection, avoiding postoperative functional impairment. Intraoperative (Io) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as an effective tool to guide a safer glioma resection. The objective of this study is to assess the real impact of Io MRI in O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase and non-O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylated glioma surgery.
   METHODS: A total of 129 patients suffering glioblastoma who underwent craniotomy for tumor resection were retrospectively evaluated between March 2009 and January 2017 at 2 different affiliated hospitals of the same university. We compared a subgroup of 65 patients operated on without Io MRI (group A) with a second subgroup of 64 patients who underwent surgery with the aid of to MRI (group B). Volumetric analyses of the extent of resection (EOR) were performed using gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. All surgical procedures were performed by a single surgeon (the senior author).
   RESULTS: The average EOR increased from 86.23% +/- 10.51% for group A to 94.01% +/- 7.42% in patients included in group B. The secondary end points of this study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PFS was found to be 5.38 +/- 2.32 months for group A versus 7.89 +/- 2.75 months for group B. Regarding OS, the average value was 13.38 +/- 4.06 months for group A versus 16.43 +/- 3.41 months for group B.
   CONCLUSIONS: We can affirm that 1.5-T Io MRI is a safe and effective technique, and its use optimizes significantly both the extent of glioma resection and the survival of patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Transarterial embolizatioin with transvenous balloon protection has been described as a promising technique for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula. The aim of our study was to report our preliminary experiences of this technique with regard to its safety and efficacy and to emphasize the procedure-related complications.
   METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients with dural arteriovenous fistula were treated with a transvenous balloon-assisted technique between March 2014 and November 2017. All lesions were embolized with Onyx via a transarterial approach with sinus balloon protection to preserve the patency of the dural sinus. Clinical and angiographic data were retrospectively collected and the occlusion rate, complications, and clinical outcome were analyzed.
   RESULTS: All 14 patients were symptomatic on admission, mean age was 40.9 years, and 9 (64.3%) of them were men. Thirteen patients had a single fistula at transverse-sigmoid sinus (n = 10) or superior sagittal sinus (n = 3), and another patient had multiple fistulas located at SSS/tentorium. Two patients presented with Cognard type I fistula, 12 with Cognard type II (IIa:6;IIb:1;IIa + b:5). Complete (8/11) or near-complete (3/11) occlusion was achieved in 11 patients (78.6%). Procedure-related complications occurred in 3 cases, including 1 epidural hemorrhage, 1 cerebellar hemorrhage, and 1 cerebellar infarction. At latest clinical follow-up (mean: 13 months), symptoms were resolved on 6 patients, relieved in 7 patients, and deteriorated in 1 patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: The transvenous balloon protection offers an alternative to treat complex dural arteriovenous fistula, but further investigation are needed to lower related complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Many articles have been published on pituitary adenomas. Bibliometric analyses are helpful for determining the most impactful studies within a field.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify the top 100 most-cited articles on pituitary adenomas using the bibliometric analysis method.
   METHODS: We searched the Thomson Reuters Web of Science on March 31, 2018. Articles were listed in descending order by the total citation (TC) number, and the most-cited articles on pituitary adenomas were identified and analyzed.
   RESULTS: The most-cited articles were published between 1970 and 2014, with 1999 as the most prolific year. Growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma was the most commonly studied tumor subtype (43%), and in clinical studies, treatment options and follow-up were the most important research focuses (62%). The average number of TCs was 326, and the average number of annual citations (ACs) was 17. More review articles were published in the last decade, and the average number of ACs was higher for this decade than for previous decades. Twenty-one articles were recognized as citation Ccassics, with a TC number >400. Twenty-five journals published the top 100 works; Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism published the most articles (25%). The most articles (43%) were published in the United States. S. Melmed wrote the greatest number of publications (14%). Departments of medicine (32%) and endocrinology (32%) contributed to the largest number of articles.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the research focuses and trends regarding pituitary adenoma and provides key references for investigators in guiding future pituitary adenoma research.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify key anatomic landmarks useful in gaining access to the anteromedial temporal region via the corridor formed by the inferior orbital fissure (IOF), the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1), and the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve (V2) via an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA).
   METHODS: An anatomic dissection of 6 cadaver heads was performed to confirm the feasibility and applicability of an EEA for accessing the anteromedial temporal region.
   RESULTS: After middle turbinectomy, the lateral recess of the sphenoid sinus was opened, the orbital apex was exposed, and the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus was removed, in sequence. The IOF and the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) were then identified. After opening the foramen rotundum (FR) and removing the bony structure between the FR, V2 was transposed downward. The orbital muscle of Muller was removed. The PPF was mobilized downward exposing the greater wing of the sphenoid bone (GWS). The GWS between V1 and V2 was drilled, therefore exposing the temporal dura. With blunt dissection, the medial temporal dura was peeled away from the cavernous sinus to increase access to the anteromedial temporal region.
   CONCLUSIONS: The anteromedial temporal fossa was exposed by drilling the V1-V2 triangle corridor via an EEA. Endoscopic endonasal exposure of the anteromedial temporal fossa is feasible and requires limited endonasal work. This approach may be considered as an alternate surgical corridor to the temporomesial lobe that offers the advantages of a direct route with less temporal lobe retraction.

AB OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery is widely used to treat brain arteriovenous malformation; however, detailed information on late radiation-induced complications (LRICs) is scarce. The goal of the present study was to characterize the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of LRICs based on our long-term follow-up data.
   METHODS: The outcomes of consecutive patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations at our institution in 1990-2010 were analyzed. Cyst formation/encapsulated hematoma (CF/EH) and radiation-induced tumor were defined as LRICs. Cumulative incidence rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for CF/EH were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model.
   RESULTS: A total of 581 patients with mean and median follow-up periods of 11.8 and 10.1 years, respectively (range, 2.0-26.7 years), were analyzed. CF/EH was observed in 30 patients (5.2%). The median time to progression was 11.8 years (range, 1.9-23.9 years). Cumulative incidence rates were 0.8%, 2.8%, 7.6%, and 9.7% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that lobar location and maximal diameter >= 22 mm were significant risk factors for CF/EH. Overall, the functional outcomes were mild, moderate, and severe/fatal in 26 (87%), 1 (3%), and 3 (10%) patients, respectively. Radiation-induced tumor was confirmed in only 1 patient (0.17%).
   CONCLUSIONS: An increased nidus size and lobar location are risk factors for CF/EH. Although the CF/EH incidence is low, some LRICs develop after long periods. Extended follow-up is warranted, particularly of patients with risk factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cervical myelopathy patients sometimes experience concurrent nonspecific moderate to severe low back pain (msLBP). However, postoperative changes in msLBP after cervical myelopathy surgery have rarely been reported. Awareness of postoperative changes in msLBP may be helpful in consultation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine postoperative changes in msLBP.
   METHODS: Patients with cervical myelopathy and msLBP (a visual analog pain score >= 5/10) were reviewed prospectively, and 53 patients (male:female ratio, 28:25; mean age, 63.1 years) were enrolled. Cervical myelopathy was assessed with the Japanese Orthopedic Association score. Cervical laminoplasty was performed in 49 patients, and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion were performed in 4 patients. The patients were followed up postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. The primary endpoint was improvement of the visual analog scale score for back pain (VAS-B) by greater than 2.6/10. Prognostic factors were analyzed postoperatively at 12 months. The mean follow-up period was 16 +/- 9 months.
   RESULTS: MsLBP improved in 58%, 49%, 53%, 52%, and 59% of the patients at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively, respectively. The VAS-B worsened after improvement or vice versa in approximately 30% of the patients during the follow-up period. Lumbar decompression operations were performed in 5 patients at 4, 6, 7, 15, and 16 months postoperatively. The recovery rate of the JOA score was a positive prognostic factor.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the exact pathophysiology was not demonstrated, cervical myelopathy surgery may directly and indirectly improve msLBP.

AB BACKGROUND: The optimal duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for preventing delayed thromboembolic events (DTEs) remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether longer DAPT provides improved protection against delayed DTEs.
   METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 507 stent-assisted coil embolization procedures using a single stent for unruptured intracranial aneurysms. We performed coarsened exact matching according to the duration of maintenance DAPT. DTEs were defined as any neurologic symptoms concerning the stented vascular territory and occurring at 1 month or later after the procedure. After stratification according to DAPT duration (short-term, <9 months; long-term, >= 9months), the log-rank test and Z-analysis were performed to evaluate the efficacy of long-term DAPT for preventing DTEs.
   RESULTS: Of 507 treated patients (median follow-up, 44 months), 25 (4.9%) experienced DTEs at 1 month after the procedure. Among all DTEs, 9 (1.8%) were infarctions confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. Permanent neurologic deficit (modified Rankin Scale score >= 2) occurred in 2 (0.4%) patients. On procedure-to-event analysis, long-term DAPT was not superior for preventing DTEs. Most events occurred within 1 month of switching from DAPT to single-antiplatelet therapy, regardless of DAPT duration. The longest time from the procedure to DTE occurrence was 22 months. Age older than 54.5 years was identified as independent risk factor for DTE-stroke.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with short-term DAPT, long-term DAPT delays the occurrence of DTEs but does not lower their incidence. Longer-term DAPT (>9 months) should be considered after stent-assisted coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, although its efficacy remains to he clarified.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate parent vessel response to deployment of 2 stents for treatment of cerebral aneurysms.
   METHODS: Fifteen patients (11 women and 4 men; age range, 25-83 years) with 18 wide-necked intracranial aneurysms were treated with 2 stents with or without subsequent coiling. The vascular diameter was measured and compared within the native parent artery, and the single stent and double stent were measured and compared before and immediately after stenting and at angiographic follow-up.
   RESULTS: Thirty stents were deployed. Before stenting, the mean vessel diameter was 3.4 + 0.21 mm at point A, 3.06 +/- 0.18 mm at point B, 3.16 +/- 0.21 mm at point C, 2.67 +/- 0.27 mm at point D, and 2.56 1 0.23 mm at point E. The deployment of 2 stents resulted in statistically significant increases in both the average vascular diameter and crosssectional area at points C (3.51 +/- 0.22 mm, P = 0.0006; and 9.76 +/- 1.17 mm(2), P = 0.001, respectively) and E (2.88 +/- 0.32 mm, P = 0.01; and 7.28 +/- 1.46 mm(2), P = 0.02, respectively) compared with prestenting. At angiographic follow-ups, compared with before stenting, significant increases were documented at point C (3.42 +/- 0.22 mm and 9.42 +/- 1.37 mm(2), respectively) at first angiographic followup but at points A (3.62 +/- 0.45 mm and 10.51 +/- 2.37 mm(2), respectively) and B (3.26 +/- 0.24 mm and 8.47 +/- 126 mm(2), respectively) at second angiographic follow-up. No significant vascular stenosis was demonstrated at the double-stent segment compared with the single-stent or native artery segments.
   CONCLUSIONS: The small tenuous cerebral arteries can well tolerate the deployment of 2 stents for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the endovascular treatment (stenting with or without coiling) of cervical and intracranial lesions associated with internal carotid artery (ICA) redundancy.
   METHODS: Nine patients harboring 12 lesions of dissections, pseudoaneurysms, and aneurysms in the presence of ICA redundancy were treated using stent deployment with or without coiling. There were 8 female and 1 male patients with an age range of 31-89 years (mean, 55 years).
   RESULTS: Two patients with ICA dissections were treated with stenting alone while all the other pseudoaneurysms and aneurysms were managed with both stenting and coiling. Fourteen stents were deployed, and the success rate of stent deployment was 100%. All the lesions were successfully occluded with subtotal occlusion in 3 lesions and total occlusions in the remaining lesions. Mean follow-up was 7.3 months (range, 3-25 months), during which time the lesions remained occluded with patent stents. No symptoms existed at follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Vascular lesions related to the internal carotid artery redundancy can be successfully managed endovascularly, and the redundancy can no longer represent an obstacle in modern era with advanced techniques and materials.

   MECHANISMS
AB OBJECTIVE: Early cytotoxic brain edema may be a decisive factor that maintains cerebral malperfusion after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In addition, endothelial cell swelling may be an independent factor restricting cerebral blood flow (CBF) in a very early stage after SAH. Immediate and aggressive treatment may be able to restore CBF in this critical period.
   METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to SAH by the endovascular filament model and treated by a bolus of hyperoncotic-hypertonic hydroxyethyl starch (4 mL/kg body weight) immediately after vessel perforation and 150 minutes later In = 12) or by the same amount of normal saline (a = 9). Mean arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and local CBF over both hemispheres were continuously measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Neurologic assessment was performed 24 hours later. Hippocampal damage was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin and Caspase-3 staining.
   RESULTS: Arterial blood gases and mean arterial blood pressure were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Intracranial pressure was significantly reduced in the treatment group (P < 0.05). Local CBF was significantly improved in the treatment group over both hemispheres (P< 0.05; 180 minutes after treatment, P < 0.01). There was a trend to better neurologic performance in the treatment group. The rate of injured neurons was significantly reduced in animals of the treatment group compared with controls (P < 0.01). The number of Caspase-3-positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 field was not reduced.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the effects of very early and repeated treatment with a high-dose hyperoncotic-hypertonic hydroxyethyl starch were investigated. The results of this series show that this therapy can be highly effective to improve CBF and attenuate hippocampal cell damage in the early stage of SAH. Whether delayed cell death could be treated by longer therapy cannot be answered by this study. Because no differential diagnosis of the clinical suspicion of SAH prohibits the administration of hypertonic-hyperoncotic solutions, it may be useful as a first-tier preclinical therapy in suspected SAH and could even be used by emergency rescue services before the patient is admitted to a hospital.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness at micro-clamping stent-retriever thrombectomy (MSRT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke with intracranial large vessel embolism (ILVE), and compare it with that of conventional stent-retriever thrombectomy (CSRT).

The rates of successful (Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [mTICI] grade 2b or 3) and complete reperfusion (mTICI grade 3), time from guide catheter placement to reperfusion, rates of first-pass success, and the number of passes for reperfusion were compared between the MSRT and CSRT groups.
   RESULTS: The complete reperfusion (mTICI 3) rates by MSRT were significantly higher than those achieved with CSRT (78.8% [41/52] vs. 57.1% [32/56], respectively; P = 0.016). Successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b or 3) rates were 92.3% (48/52) in the MSRT group and 83.9% (47/56) in the CSRT groups (P = 0.181). The mean number of passes for reperfusion was significantly lower with MSRT compared with CSRT (1.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.5, respectively; P = 0.001). The first-pass success rates were significantly higher in the MSRT group than in the CSRT group (65.4% [34/52] vs. 28.6% [16/56]; P = 0.0001). The mean time from guide catheter placement to reperfusion was significantly shorter in the MSRT group (20.5 +/- 6.6 minutes vs. 46.3 +/- 7.6 minutes; P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the complete reperfusion rates and mechanical thrombectomy efficiency in patients with ILVE are better after MSRT compared with CSRT.

ID INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; TRIAL
AB OBJECTIVE: After severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) associated with uncontrollable high intracranial pressure (ICP), today the main challenge for neurosurgeons remains to identify who may obtain benefit from decompressive craniectomy (DC) and which factors after DC influence the prognosis of these patients. The aim of this paper was to identify the pre- and postoperative determinants of outcome after DC.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients undergoing DC for sTBI from 2003 to 2011. The 6-month outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), was dichotomized into favorable (GOS scores 4 and 5) and unfavorable (GOS scores 1-3) outcome. Predictors of outcome were identified by uni- and multivariate analysis.
   RESULTS: There were 190 patients who underwent DC for sTBI in this study. Sixty patients (31.6%) died within 30 days after DC. Independent prognostic factors for survival after 30 days were Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission greater than 5 (P = 0.002) and bilateral pupil reactivity (P < 0.0001). Thirty days after DC, 67 patients (51.5%) out of 130 had unfavorable outcome (GOS scores 1-3) and 63 patients (49.5%) presented favorable outcome (GOS scores 4 and 5). The independent preoperative prognostic factors for poor outcome were age over 65 years (P < 0.0001) and bilateral absence of pupil reactivity (P = 0.0165). After DC, onset of postoperative hydrocephalus and delayed cranioplasty (3 months after DC) was associated with unfavorable outcome at multivariate analysis (P = 0.002 and P < 0.0001, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the development of hydrocephalus after DC for sTBI and delayed cranial reconstruction were associated with unfavorable outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: Approximately 12% of intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) occur in the thalamus. Understanding the anatomic regions involved with thalamic hemorrhages is potentially useful, offering the physician a more accurate prognosis for patient outcomes. This study was performed to determine if thalamic hemorrhage location observed on a computed tomography (CT) scan was predictive of neurologic outcomes.
   METHODS: A sample of 168 thalamic hemorrhage patients admitted to a tertiary care center were analyzed. Axial CT scans of thalamic hemorrhages were classified into 1 of 6 possible categories based on thalamic nuclei anatomy: anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, central, or global. For each classification, patient clinical characteristics were collected to identify variables indicative of clinical outcome. Outcome measures used in this study included mortality, hospital length of stay, readmission within 30 days, ICH score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, neurologic deterioration (calculated as a change in modified Rankin scale score from admission to discharge), and discharge disposition.
   RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, patients with posterior and lateral thalamic hemorrhages demonstrated a decreased likelihood of mortality; patients with posterior hemorrhages were less likely to have neurologic deterioration relative to global thalamic hemorrhages when controlling for hemorrhage volume and ventriculomegaly. Ventriculomegaly and hemorrhage volume were also predictive of both mortality and neurologic deterioration.
   CONCLUSIONS: In thalamic hemorrhages, patient prognosis may be influenced by hemorrhage location, with posterior and lateral hemorrhages demonstrating better clinical outcome versus hemorrhages in other locations. This is potentially valuable because hemorrhage location affords the treating physician a readily available prognostic factor when assessing intracranial hemorrhages.

AB OBJECTIVE: The optimal surgical and antimicrobial treatment for intracranial infections after neurosurgery is unknown. We investigated the clinical, laboratory, and microbiological characteristics of intracranial infections after neurosurgery. In addition, treatment outcome in patients treated according to a standardized algorithm was evaluated.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients with extradural, intradural, and device-related infections after cranial neurosurgery were included prospectively. A standardized antimicrobial and surgical treatment regimen was applied. The probability of infection-free survival was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier survival method. Survival curves between groups were compared by using log-rank Mantel-Cox test.
   RESULTS: Of 103 infections, 58 (56%) were extradural, 33 (32%) intradural, and 12 (12`)/0) device-associated. Foreign material was involved in 98 infections (95%), including 78 bone flaps or fixation devices, 41 duraplastics, 17 external drains, and 15 functional devices. The median duration from primary surgery until infection diagnosis was 33 days (range, 6-1132 days). In total, 69 infections (67%) were monomicrobial, 26 (25%) polymicrobial, and 8 (8%) culture-negative. Ninety of 103 patients (90%) underwent surgical intervention, of whom foreign material was retained in 24 (23%). The probability of infection-free survival was 87% after 12 months (95% confidence interval 77%-93%). Nonadequate antimicrobial therapy was associated with treatment failure (5% vs. 70%, P < 0.001), which remained significant in the multiple logistic regression model (P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Most (95%) intracranial infections were associated with foreign material and required surgical intervention and biofilm-active treatment. Via a standardized treatment approach, the infection-free survival after 12 months was good (87%), independent of the infection site or type of micro-organism.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and radiologic outcome of patients with acoustic neuroma (AN) treated with linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife-based stereotactic radiosurgery with respect to tumor control, preservation of serviceable hearing, and toxicity.
   METHODS: A retrospective monocentric analysis including all patients who underwent single-fraction LINAC or CyberKnife-based radiosurgery for AN between 1991 and 2015. Patient data were analyzed in terms of radiologic and clinical tumor control (no further intervention needed), treatment-related complications, preservation of serviceable hearing, and objectified hearing loss using pure tone average levels.
   RESULTS: We included 335 patients (median age 58.2 years, treated either by LINAC-based [n = 270] or CyberKnife [n = 65] stereotactic radiosurgery). The median tumor volume was 1.1 ml (0.1-23.7 ml). The median radiation dose was 12 Gy (LINAC 12 Gy, 11-20 Gy; CyberKnife 13 Gy, 12-13 Gy) at an isodose level of 71.7% (LINAC 68.3%, 31.9%-86.2%; CyberKnife 80%, 65%-81%). The median follow-up was 30 months (LINAC 43 months, 2-224 months; CyberKnife 13 months, 4-37 months). Clinical tumor control was 98%, 89%, and 88% at 2, 5, and 10 years. The objective actuarial hearing preservation rate was 89%, 80%, and 55% at 1, 2, and 5 years. New symptoms were observed in 11.3% and classified as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1/2, apart from 4 patients (1.2%), who developed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that in AN, high tumor control and considerable hearing preservation rates can be achieved by single-dose radiosurgery at low toxicity rates, resulting in a positive impact on long-term clinical outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: There is limited information on O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status, extent of surgical resection, and its impact on overall outcomes in patients with glioblastoma (GBM).
   METHODS: After institutional review board approval, 233 newly diagnosed patients with GBM with known MGMT status (2009-2015) were included in our analysis. Clinical, imaging, and follow-up data were collected from the database. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were the primary and secondary end points, respectively.
   RESULTS: Of patients, 51.9% were younger than 65 years and 442% were noted to have promoter methylation of MGMT. Median residual tumor volume was 11 cm(3) and extent of complete resection of enhancing tumor on imaging was 96%. Estimated median OS and PFS were 10.9 months and 5.4 months, respectively. MGMT status was an independent predictor of PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; P = 0.005) but only marginally associated with OS (P = 0.059). In MGMT methylated patients, extent of resection (>= 86%) and good performance status (Karnofsky Performance Status >= 70) were independently associated with PFS and OS, respectively (PFS: HR, 0.21; P = 0.015; OS: HR, 0.05; P = 0.002). In MGMT promoter unmethylated patients, extent of resection (>= 86%) was independently associated with OS (P = 0.039). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was associated with OS/PFS irrespective of age and MGMT status.
   CONCLUSIONS: Greater extent of resection of enhancing tumor was associated with improved PFS in MGMT promoter methylated patients, OS regardless of MGMT status. Elderly patients with methylated MGMT promoter were found to have improved PFS whereas younger patients had improved OS with MGMT promoter methylated status.

AB BACKGROUND: Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy is a common complication after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and usually manifests with dysphagia, hoarseness, and respiratory difficulties. Next to proven risk factors, such as age and multilevel procedures, RLN palsy has been speculated to occur more frequently after secondary ACDF procedures.
   METHODS: We analyzed a prospective registry of all consecutive patients undergoing zero-profile ACDF for disc herniation, myelopathy, or stenosis. RLN palsy was defined as persistent patient self-reported dysphagia, hoarseness, or respiratory problems without other identifiable causes. RLN palsy was assessed at scheduled 6-week telephone interviews.
   RESULTS: Among 525 included patients, 511 primary and 40 secondary ACDF procedures were performed. Hoarseness was present in 12 (2.2%) cases, whereas dysphagia and respiratory difficulties both occurred in 3 (0.5%) cases. Overall incidence of RLN palsy was 2% after primary procedures and 8% after secondary procedures (P = 0.017). These rates are in line with the peer-reviewed literature, and the difference remained significant after controlling for confounders in a multivariate model (P = 0.033). Other reported risk factors, such as age, sex, surgical time, and multilevel procedures, had no relevant effect (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on our data and other published series in the literature, RLN palsy may occur more frequently after secondary ACDF procedures with a clinically relevant effect size. There is a striking lack of uniformity in methods and reporting in research on RLN injury.

AB OBJECTIVE: To radiologically measure the parameters of endplates and the apophyseal ring and to suggest an applicable length for a lumbar interbody cage for Chinese patients.
   METHODS: Twenty-four volunteers were enrolled to undergo lumbar computed tomography (CT). On the end-plate plane, the diameters of the endplates (L1-S1) were measured along the axis of the cage with different lumbar interbody fusion procedures. Whereas the mid-oblique diameter (mid-OD) and maximum oblique diameter (max-OD) were defined as the minimal and maximal diameters of the endplates in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), side-sagittal diameter (side-SD), mid-sagittal diameter (mid-SD), and transverse diameter (TD) represented the diameters of endplates in posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF); and oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF)/extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF), /direct lateral interbody fusion (DLIF), respectively. R1-R10 were the widths of the apophyseal ring covered by diameters at both ends. We used the proposed formula to calculate the cage length: 1) minimal length of TLIF cage [mid-OD - 1/2 (R1 + R2), 2) maximal length of TLIF cage [max-OD - 1/2 (R3 + R4), 3) length of PLIF cage [side-SD - 1/2 (R5 + R6), 4) length of OLIF/XLIF/DLIF cage [TD - 1/2 (R7 + R8), and 5) length of ALIF cage [mid-SD - 1/2 (R9 + R10).
   RESULTS: The lengths of the TLIF cage were more than 30 mm for men and 26 mm for women in L1/2-L4/5, with a large range in L5-S1. For PLIF, the lengths were 28 to 30 mm for men and 24 to 26 mm for women in L1/2-L4/5, with 26 mm and 22 mm, respectively, in L5-S1. For the OLIF/XLIF/ DLIF cage, the lengths were 38 mm in L1/2 and 41 to 43 mm in L2/3-L4/5 for men and 35 mm in L1/2-L2/3 and 38 mm in L3/4-L4/5 for women. The ALIF cage lengths were 27 mm in L1/2 and L5-S1 and 29 mm in L2/3-L4/5 for men and 23 mm in L1/2 and L5-S1 and 25 mm in L2/3-L4/5 for women.
   CONCLUSIONS: The choice of an appropriate length for a lumbar interbody cage should be based on the procedure and fusion level, which can match the endplates anatomically. The size of the lumbar interbody cage is affected by many factors, and a simple calculation may not be clinically relevant.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlation between the K-line-based classification of patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and their outcome after anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF) surgery.
   METHODS: A series of 24 patients with multisegmental OPLL were enrolled. All patients underwent ACAF surgery. First, the patients were classified into 2 groups according to their K-line classification. Then, we separated the patients into subgroups according to their OPLL thickness. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores before and 6 months after surgery were studied, and the recovery rate (RR) was calculated. The preoperative and postoperative radiologic parameters were also investigated.
   RESULTS: Clinical and radiographic assessments showed no significant correlation between the K-line- based classification of patients with OPLL and their outcome of ACAF surgery (P> 0.05). When the OPLL was 56 mm thick, K-line-based classification groups had a similar change of occupation ratio and RR (P > 0.05). However, when the OPLL was >6 mm thick, the mean RR was 61.8% 1 14.0% in the K-line ( + ) group and 78.3% 1 9.7% in the Kline ( - ) group (P < 0.05), and the mean was 16.0% +/- 4.2% in the K-line ( + ) group and 28.0% + 7.1% in the K-line (-) group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that K-line can predict the clinical outcome of ACAF surgery for multisegmental OPLL in a different way from posterior decompression surgery. When the OPLL was thin, the outcome was satisfactory and there was no correlation with K-line-based classification of patients with OPLL. When the OPLL was >6 mm thick, the K-line ( - ) group patients had a better outcome than did K-line ( + ) group patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Many practicing spine surgeons believe that instrumentation can be removed during revision surgery in successful posterolateral or anterior spinal fusions, confirmed by computed tomography and intraoperative exploration. The stress-shielding effect of spinal instrumentation was well described in the late 1980s and 1990s but has not received recent attention. Despite the paucity of recent literature, concepts underlying the biology and biomechanics of the spinal fusion mass remain particularly salient given the increasing incidence of revision spinal fusion surgery. The aim of this study was to highlight a potential complication of instrumentation removal owing to stress shielding of instrumentation on the spinal column and fusion mass.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was performed, and a small case series was described.
   RESULTS: In 3 cases, despite apparent solid fusion demonstrated on preoperative computed tomography and confirmed by intraoperative exploration, new fractures developed after removal of instrumentation. In these cases, fracture occurred at the transition zone between the newly rigid instrumented area and previous fusion. This highlights the relative weakness of the fusion and may be explained by the stress-shielding effect of instrumentation within the fusion mass.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal instrumentation revision requires careful consideration, and routine implant removal should not be performed. The presence of a solid fusion on computed tomography and/or at intraoperative exploration may not justify implant removal in these cases. In cases of extension of a fusion, use of a bridging connection to the new implants should be considered. The cases presented demonstrate the consequences of the stress-shielding effect of implants on the spine and fusion mass.

AB BACKGROUND: Oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF) surgery provides a convenient and minimal access to the lesion disc with few complications; however, the left lumbar sympathetic trunk (LST) lies in the surgical field with a certain incidence of injury. The aim of this study was to describe the anatomic structures of the left LST at risk for injury during OLIF at different lumbar segment levels based on radiologic evaluations.
   METHODS: Forty-four healthy young people (22 men and 22 women) were recruited, and routine lumbar magnetic resonance radiograph was performed. The LST, abdominal aorta (AA), and psoas muscle (PM) were observed, and all parameters were acquired using axial T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequence images. Independent-samples t test, 1-way analysis of variance test, and Least significant difference test were used to explore the LST's tract and the anatomic relationship with the adjacent anatomic landmarks at different levels.
   RESULTS: The distance from the left lateral border of the AA to the anterior medial border of the left PM was significantly narrowing from the L2-3 to 14-5 segment levels (13.72 +/- 3.00, 11.78 +/- 2.69, and 9.18 +/- 3.43 mm). The distance from the left lateral border of the AA to the left LST was also significantly decreased from the L2-3 to L4-5 segment levels (11.14 +/- 2.89, 9.36 +/- 2.79, and 6.63 +/- 2.94 mm). However, the distance from the leading edge of the left PM to the left LST had no statistical differences among all adjacent segment levels (2.961 - 0.62, 2.83 1 0.62, and 3.07 = 0.86 mm). The location of the left LST is more backward and lateral at level L2-3, whereas it is inside front at levels L3-4 and L4-5.
   CONCLUSIONS: The practical risk of LST injury in different segment levels varied with specific anatomic conditions. The segment level L2-3 could provide a safer surgical space for OLIF, and the risk of the left LST injury might be greater during OLIF at level L4-5.

AB OBJECTIVES: Limited data regarding intracranial mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MCS) are available. The goal of this study was to report the clinical characteristics, challenges in management, and poor outcomes of intracranial MCS.
   METHODS: Clinical data for 16 patients with MCS were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate their clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes.
   RESULTS: This study included 11 male and 5 female patients with a mean age of 22.9 +/- 14.4 years. The most common presentations were headache (n = 10; 62.5%), followed by cranial deficits (n = 7; 43.6%). The radiologic spectrum for MCS was broad, and only 18.8% (3/16) of MCSs were correctly diagnosed preoperatively. Aggressive resection (including subtotal resection and gross total resection) and partial resection was performed in 62.5% (10/16) and 37.50% (6/16) of patients. With a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 10-78 months), 5 patients (31.3%) died and 8 patients (50%) developed tumor recurrence. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year rates of progression-free survival and overall survival were 86%, 53%, and 42% and 93%, 70%, and 56%, respectively. Although the differences were not significantly different, aggressive resection and the use of radiotherapy tended to improve the prognosis of the patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics of MCS are variable. The current management of intracranial MCS referring to conventional chondrosarcoma could not yield satisfactory outcomes. Further study is needed to identify the optimal treatments.

AB BACKGROUND: Predictors of surgical outcomes following traumatic axis (C2) fractures in octogenarians remain undercharacterized.
   METHODS: Patients age >= 80 years undergoing cervical spine surgery following traumatic C2 fractures were extracted from the National Sample Program of the National Trauma Data Bank (2003-2012). Outcomes include overall inpatient complications, individual complications with an incidence >1%, hospital length of stay (HLOS), discharge disposition, and mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, and injury predictors were analyzed using multivariable regression. Odds ratios (OR), mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Statistical significance was assessed at P < 0.05.
   RESULTS: The cohort of 442 patients was 48.6% male and had a mean age of 84.3 +/- 2.7 years. The distribution of admissions was 42.3% to the hospital floor, 40.3% to the intensive care unit (ICU), 7.7% to telemetry, 2.0% to the operating room, and 7.7% to other/unknown. Mortality was 9.7%, mean HLOS was 13.1 +/- 9.2 days, the rate of complications was 38.5%, and 81.5% of survivors were discharged to a nonhome facility. Injury severitywas predictive of mortality and overall complications. History of bleeding disorder/coagulopathy predicted mortality (OR, 4.02; 95% CI, 1.07-15.05), overall complications (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.09-8.32), cardiac arrest (OR, 8.19; 95% CI, 1.06-63.54), and renal complications (OR, 10.36; 95% CI, 2.13-50.38). History of congestive heart failure predicted mortality (OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.10-8.69). ICU admission (vs. floor) predicted overall complications (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.23-3.27) and pneumonia (OR, 4.65; 95% CI, 1.91-11.30). Telemetry admission (vs. floor) predicted unplanned intubation (OR, 7.76; 95% CI, 1.24-48.49).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of octogenarians undergoing surgery for traumatic C2 fracture, injury severity and a history of bleeding disorder/coagulopathy were identified as risk factors for inpatient complications and mortality. Heightened surveillance should be considered for ICU and/or telemetry admissions for the development of complications. These findings warrant consideration by the clinician, patient, and family to informclinical decisions and goals of care.

DE Representation learning; Word embedding; Natural language processing;
   Medical code; Electronic health records; Healthcare resource utilization
AB There have been rapidly growing applications using machine learning models for predictive analytics in Electronic Health Records (EHR) to improve the quality of hospital services and the efficiency of healthcare resource utilization. A fundamental and crucial step in developing such models is to convert medical codes in EHR to feature vectors. These medical codes are used to represent diagnoses or procedures. Their vector representations have a tremendous impact on the performance of machine learning models. Recently, some researchers have utilized representation learning methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to learn vector representations of medical codes. However, most previous approaches are unsupervised, i.e. the generation of medical code vectors is independent from prediction tasks. Thus, the obtained feature vectors may be inappropriate for a specific prediction task. Moreover, unsupervised methods often require a lot of samples to obtain reliable results, but most practical problems have very limited patient samples. In this paper, we develop a new Method called Prediction Task Guided Health Record Aggregation (PTGHRA), which aggregates health records guided by prediction tasks, to construct training corpus for various representation learning models. Compared with unsupervised approaches, representation learning models integrated with PTGHRA yield a significant improvement in predictive capability of generated medical code vectors, especially for limited training samples.

AB Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied in predicting disease onset risks with Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. While these models demonstrated promising results on relatively small data sets, the generalizability and transferability of those models and its applicability to different patient populations across hospitals have not been evaluated. In this study, we evaluated an RNN model, RETAIN, over Cerner Health Facts (R) EMR data, for heart failure onset risk prediction. Our data set included over 150,000 heart failure patients and over 1,000,000 controls from nearly 400 hospitals. Convincingly, RETAIN achieved an AUC of 82% in comparison to an AUC of 79% for logistic regression, demonstrating the power of more expressive deep learning models for EHR predictive modeling. The prediction performance fluctuated across different patient groups and varied from hospital to hospital. Also, we trained RETAIN models on individual hospitals and found that the model can be applied to other hospitals with only about 3.6% of reduction of AUC. Our results demonstrated the capability of RNN for predictive modeling with large and heterogeneous EHR data, and pave the road for future improvements.

AB The age of the population worldwide is rapidly increasing, bringing social and economic challenges. Persuasive technology can alleviate the burden on traditional healthcare services when used to support healthy behaviors, for instance in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Additionally, healthy behaviors are key factors for active and healthy ageing by delaying or even reversing functional decline. In this manuscript, we present a multi-perspective analysis of technologies that can be used in the support of active and healthy ageing in the daily life. First, we take the perspective of physical and mental health, by focusing on the promotion of physical activity and emotional wellbeing. From a temporal perspective, we look at how technology evolved from past, present and future. The overview of the literature is structured in four main sections: (1) measurement of current behavior (monitoring), (2) analysis of the data gathered to derive meaningful information (analyzing & reasoning), (3) support the individual in the adoption or maintenance of a behavior (coaching), and (4) tools or interfaces that provide the information to the individual to stimulate the desired behavior (applications). Finally, we provide recommendations for the design, development and implementation of future technological innovations to support Active and Healthy Ageing in daily life.

   spanning tree based clustering; Graph clustering; Similarity measure
ID CENTRALITY; DOMAIN
AB Objective: Automatic text summarization offers an efficient solution to access the ever-growing amounts of both scientific and clinical literature in the biomedical domain by summarizing the source documents while maintaining their most informative contents. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based summarization method that takes advantage of the domain-specific knowledge and a well-established data mining technique called frequent itemset mining.
   Methods: Our summarizer exploits the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to construct a concept-based model of the source document and mapping the document to the concepts. Then, it discovers frequent itemsets to take the correlations among multiple concepts into account. The method uses these correlations to propose a similarity function based on which a represented graph is constructed. The summarizer then employs a minimum spanning tree based clustering algorithm to discover various subthemes of the document. Eventually, it generates the final summary by selecting the most informative and relative sentences from all subthemes within the text. Results: We perform an automatic evaluation over a large number of summaries using the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics. The results demonstrate that the proposed summarization system outperforms various baselines and benchmark approaches.
   Conclusion: The carried out research suggests that the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge and frequent itemset mining equips the summarization system in a better way to address the informativeness measurement of the sentences. Moreover, clustering the graph nodes (sentences) can enable the summarizer to target different main subthemes of a source document efficiently. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of the summarization systems in the biomedical domain.

ID SNOMED CT; GENE ONTOLOGY; REUSE
AB Ontologies and terminologies have been identified as key resources for the achievement of semantic inter operability in biomedical domains. The development of ontologies is performed as a joint work by domain experts and knowledge engineers. The maintenance and auditing of these resources is also the responsibility of such experts, and this is usually a time-consuming, mostly manual task. Manual auditing is impractical and ineffective for most biomedical ontologies, especially for larger ones. An example is SNOMED CT, a key resource in many countries for codifying medical information. SNOMED CT contains more than 300000 concepts. Consequently its auditing requires the support of automatic methods. Many biomedical ontologies contain natural language content for humans and logical axioms for machines. The 'lexically suggest, logically define' principle means that there should be a relation between what is expressed in natural language and as logical axioms, and that such a relation should be useful for auditing and quality assurance. Besides, the meaning of this principle is that the natural language content for humans could be used to generate the logical axioms for the machines. In this work, we propose a method that combines lexical analysis and clustering techniques to (1) identify regularities in the natural language content of ontologies; (2) cluster, by similarity, labels exhibiting a regularity; (3) extract relevant information from those clusters; and (4) propose logical axioms for each cluster with the support of axiom templates. These logical axioms can then be evaluated with the existing axioms in the ontology to check their correctness and completeness, which are two fundamental objectives in auditing and quality assurance. In this paper, we describe the application of the method to two SNOMED CT modules, a 'congenital' module, obtained using concepts exhibiting the attribute occurrence-Congenital, and a 'chronic' module, using concepts exhibiting the attribute Clinical course-Chronic. We obtained a precision and a recall of respectively 75% and 28% for the 'congenital' module, and 64% and 40% for the 'chronic' one. We consider these results to be promising, so our method can contribute to the support of content editors by using automatic methods for assuring the quality of biomedical ontologies and terminologies.

AB The formation of healthy habits is considered to play a fundamental role in health behavior change. A variety of studies on Health Behavior Change Support Systems (HBCSS) have been conducted recently, in which individuals use such systems to influence their own attitudes or behaviors to achieve their personal goals. However, comparatively much less research has been devoted to studying how the users of these systems form habits with the help of HBCSS, or to understanding how to design these systems to support habit formation.
   Objective: The objective of this article is to study HBCSS user experiences regarding habit formation through an intervention study targeted at establishing a healthier lifestyle. This study also aims to map habit formation stages, as suggested by Lally and Gardner, with the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model. The application domain is the prevention of metabolic syndrome, in which 5% weight loss can significantly reduce the prevalence of the syndrome.
   Methods: This study employs a web-based HBCSS named Onnikka, a lifestyle intervention designed for the prevention of metabolic syndrome for participants who are at risk of developing a metabolic syndrome or are already suffering from it. The system under investigation was designed according to the principles of the PSD model and Behavior Change Support System framework. Lally and Gardner's research on the stages of habit formation were used to study the extent to which the Onnikka system was able to enhance the development of new habits. A total of 43 Onnikka users were interviewed for this study during and after a 52-week intervention period. The research approach employed here was hermeneutics, which leans ontologically toward the social construction of reality, gained through language, consciousness, and shared meaning. In addition, the system's login data and participants' weight measurements were utilized to build an interpretation of the results.
   Results: The findings of this study suggest that IT habits appear to have a strong linkage with use adherence, whereas lifestyle habits did not seem to be directly related to the 5% weight loss among study participants. Moreover, habit formation stages provide a possible explanation for why self-monitoring, reminders, and tunneling were perceived as especially valuable features in this study.
   Conclusions: For sustainable weight management, holistic e-health interventions are required, and the PSD model offers a practical approach for designing and developing them. Recognizing the stages of habit formation provides additional valuable guidance for designing systems that help shape an individual's habits.

ID BIOMEDICAL TEXT
AB Text mining of scientific libraries and social media has already proven itself as a reliable tool for drug re purposing and hypothesis generation. The task of mapping a disease mention to a concept in a controlled vocabulary, typically to the standard thesaurus in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), is known as medical concept normalization. This task is challenging due to the differences in the use of medical terminology between health care professionals and social media texts coming from the lay public. To bridge this gap, we use sequence learning with recurrent neural networks and semantic representation of one- or multi-word expressions: we develop end-to-end architectures directly tailored to the task, including bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Units with an attention mechanism, and additional semantic similarity features based on UMLS. Our evaluation against a standard benchmark shows that recurrent neural networks improve results over an effective baseline for classification based on convolutional neural networks. A qualitative examination of mentions discovered in a dataset of user reviews collected from popular online health information platforms as well as a quantitative evaluation both show improvements in the semantic representation of health-related expressions in social media.

ID NETWORKS
AB We have three contributions in this work: 1. We explore the utility of a stacked denoising autoencoder and a paragraph vector model to learn task-independent dense patient representations directly from clinical notes. To analyze if these representations are transferable across tasks, we evaluate them in multiple supervised setups to predict patient mortality, primary diagnostic and procedural category, and gender. We compare their performance with sparse representations obtained from a bag-of-words model. We observe that the learned generalized representations significantly outperform the sparse representations when we have few positive instances to learn from, and there is an absence of strong lexical features. 2. We compare the model performance of the feature set constructed from a bag of words to that obtained from medical concepts. In the latter case, concepts represent problems, treatments, and tests. We find that concept identification does not improve the classification performance. 3. We propose novel techniques to facilitate model interpretability. To understand and interpret the representations, we explore the best encoded features within the patient representations obtained from the autoencoder model. Further, we calculate feature sensitivity across two networks to identify the most significant input features for different classification tasks when we use these pretrained representations as the supervised input. We successfully extract the most influential features for the pipeline using this technique.

TI A decision support system for antibiotic prescription based on local

AB Background: Local cumulative antibiograms are useful tools with which to select appropriate empiric or directed therapies when treating infectious diseases at a hospital. However, data represented in traditional antibiograms are static, incomplete and not well adapted to decision-making.
   Methods: We propose a decision support method for empiric antibiotic therapy based on the Number Needed to Fail (NNF) measure. NNF indicates the number of patients that would need to be treated with a specific antibiotic for one to be inadequately treated. We define two new measures, Accumulated Efficacy and Weighted Accumulated Efficacy in order to determine the efficacy of an antibiotic. We carried out two experiments: the first during which there was a suspicion of infection and the patient had empiric therapy, and the second by considering patients with confirmed infection and directed therapy. The study was performed with 15,799 cultures with 356,404 susceptibility tests carried out over a four-year period.
   Results: The most efficient empiric antibiotics are Linezolid and Vancomycin for blood samples and Imipenem and Meropenem for urine samples. In both experiments, the efficacies of recommended antibiotics are all significantly greater than the efficacies of the antibiotics actually administered (P < 0.001). The highest efficacy is obtained when considering 2 years of antibiogram data and 80% of the cumulated prevalence of microorganisms.
   Conclusion: This extensive study on real empiric therapies shows that the proposed method is a valuable alternative to traditional antibiograms as regards developing clinical decision support systems for antimicrobial stewardship.

   drug-drug interaction
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Drug-drug interaction prediction; Positive-unlabeled learning;
   Meta-learning; Representation learning
AB Motivation: Predicting Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) has become a crucial step in the drug discovery and development process, owing to the rise in the number of drugs co-administered with other drugs. Consequently, the usage of computational methods for DDI prediction can greatly help in reducing the costs of in vitro experiments done during the drug development process. With lots of emergent data sources that describe the properties and relationships between drugs and drug-related entities (gene, protein, disease, and side effects), an integrated approach that uses multiple data sources would be most effective.
   Method: We propose a semi-supervised learning framework which utilizes representation learning, positive unlabeled (PU) learning and meta-learning efficiently to predict the drug interactions. Information from multiple data sources is used to create feature networks, which is used to learn the meta-knowledge about the DDIs. Given that DDIs have only positive labeled data, a PU learning-based classifier is used to generate meta-knowledge from feature networks. Finally, a meta-classifier that combines the predicted probability of interaction from the meta-knowledge learnt is designed.
   Results: Node2vec, a network representation learning method and bagging SVM, a PU learning algorithm, are used in this work. Both representation learning and PU learning algorithms improve the performance of the system by 22% and 12.7% respectively. The meta-classifier performs better and predicts more reliable DDIs than the base classifiers.

AB Ensuring the health and safety of independent-living senior citizens is a growing societal concern. Researchers have developed sensor based systems to monitor senior citizens' Activity of Daily Living (ADL), a set of daily activities that can indicate their self-caring ability. However, most ADL monitoring systems are designed for one specific sensor modality, resulting in less generalizable models that is not flexible to account variations in real life monitoring settings. Current classic machine learning and deep learning methods do not provide a generalizable solution to recognize complex ADLs for different sensor settings. This study proposes a novel Sequence-to-Sequence model based deep-learning framework to recognize complex ADLs leveraging an activity state representation. The proposed activity state representation integrated motion and environment sensor data without labor-intense feature engineering. We evaluated our proposed framework against several state-of-the-art machine leaming and deep learning benchmarks. Overall, our approach outperformed baselines in most performance metrics, accurately recognized complex ADLs from different types of sensor input. This framework can generalize to different sensor settings and provide a viable approach to understand senior citizen's daily activity patterns with smart home health monitoring systems.

AB In the past, algorithms exploiting varying semantics in interactions between biological objects such as genes and diseases have been used in bioinformatics to uncover latent relationships within biological datasets.
   In this paper, we consider the algorithm Medusa in parallel with binary classification in order to find potential compounds to inhibit oral cancer. Oral cancer affects the mouth and pharynx and has a high mortality rate due to its late discovery. Current methods of oral cancer treatment, such as chemoradiation and surgery, fail to provide better chances for survival, warranting an alternative approach. By running Medusa on a data fusion graph consisting of biological objects, we incorporate binary classification to model the algorithm's association detection to discover compounds with the potential to mitigate the effects of oral cancer.

DE ADHD; Bi-objective SVM; FMRI
ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
AB Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common diseases in school aged children. In this paper, we consider using fMRI data with classification techniques to aid the diagnosis of ADHD and propose a bi-objective ADHD classification scheme based on L-1-norm support vector machine (SVM). In our classification model, two objectives, namely, the margin of separation and the empirical error are considered at the same time. Then the normal boundary intersection (NBI) method of Das and Dennis is used to solve the bi-objective optimization problem. A representative nondominated set which reflects the entire trade-off information between the two objectives is obtained. Each representative nondominated point in the set corresponds to an efficient classifier. Finally a decision maker can choose a final efficient classifier from the set according to the performance of each classifier. Our scheme avoids the trial and error process for regularization hyper-parameter selection. Experimental results show that our bi-objective optimization classification scheme for ADHD diagnosis performs considerably better than some traditional classification methods.

AB Although i2b2, a popular platform for patient cohort discovery using electronic health record (EHR) data, can support multiple projects specific to individual disease areas or research interests, the standard approach for doing so duplicates data across projects, requiring additional disk space and processing time, which limits scalability. To address this deficiency, we developed a novel approach that stored data in a single i2b2 fact table and used structured query language (SQL) views to access data for specific projects. Compared to the standard approach, the view-based approach reduced required disk space by 59% and extract-transfer-load (ETL) time by 46%, without substantially impacting query performance. The view-based approach has enabled scalability of multiple i2b2 projects and generalized to another data model at our institution.

AB Context The collection of narrative spontaneous reports is an irreplaceable source for the prompt detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). In such task qualified domain experts manually revise a huge amount of narrative descriptions and then encode texts according to MedDRA standard terminology. The manual annotation of narrative documents with medical terminology is a subtle and expensive task, since the number of reports is growing up day-by-day.
   Objectives: Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications can support the work of people responsible for pharmacovigilance. Our objective is to develop NLP algorithms and tools for the detection of ADR clinical terminology. Efficient applications can concretely improve the quality of the experts' revisions. NLP software can quickly analyze narrative texts and offer an encoding (i.e., a list of MedDRA terms) that the expert has to revise and validate.
   Methods: MagiCoder, an NLP algorithm, is proposed for the automatic encoding of free-text descriptions into MedDRA terms. MagiCoder procedure is efficient in terms of computational complexity. We tested MagiCoder through several experiments. In the first one, we tested it on a large dataset of about 4500 manually revised reports, by performing an automated comparison between human and MagiCoder encoding. Moreover, we tested MagiCoder on a set of about 1800 reports, manually revised ex novo by some experts of the domain, who also compared automatic solutions with the gold reference standard. We also provide two initial experiments with reports written in English, giving a first evidence of the robustness of MagiCoder w.r.t. the change of the language.
   Results: For the current base version of MagiCoder, we measured an average recall and precision of 86.9% and 91.8%, respectively.
   Conclusions: From a practical point of view, MagiCoder reduces the time required for encoding ADR reports. Pharmacologists have only to review and validate the MedDRA terms proposed by the application, instead of choosing the right terms among the 70 K low level terms of MedDRA. Such improvement in the efficiency of pharmacologists' work has a relevant impact also on the quality of the subsequent data analysis. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian pharmacovigilance language. However, our proposal is based on a general approach, not depending on the considered language nor the term dictionary.

ID RIVER-BASINS; FRAMEWORK; CONFLICT
AB Water is central to sustainable development; making transboundary cooperation among riparian a core aspect of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 6 on water and sanitation includes an indicator, SDG Indicator 6.5.2, to assess cooperation over transboundary waters by measuring the "Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation." The definitions developed by the methodology for calculating the Indicator have the potential to significantly impact the resulting structure and type of cooperation that are assessed and that will develop. Indeed, the composition of this indicator will both directly and indirectly influence water diplomacy, international policy, and water law. In this research, we analyze the methodology for assessing SDG Indicator 6.5.2, examine how operational cooperative arrangements are defined, and identify the strengths and limitations of the method for measuring transboundary water cooperation. This is done by simulating the application of the methodology and calculating the Indicator in three national case studies (Bangladesh, Honduras, and Uganda) and in a global overview. The unequal distribution regionally of operational cooperation is evident, as well as the gap in coverage between transboundary surface waters and aquifers. However, the normative and binary nature of the Indicator obscures the political complexity of establishing cooperative processes and has the potential to present a false depiction of the extent of cooperation that is occurring over shared waters. In this article, we also discuss bias that can be introduced with using surface area as a metric to assess cooperation that results in weighting larger basins and aquifers over smaller basins in the calculation of the Indicator. This paper presents a basis for further analysis of SDG Indicator 6.5.2 and the possible adaptations of the Indicator design to better assess transboundary water cooperation.

AB Documenting the changing sources of water during high streamflows following rainfall is important for understanding catchment behaviour. This study uses tritium (H-3), major ion concentrations, and delta O-18 values to identify the sources of water that sustained streamflow in the upper Yarra and Latrobe catchments of southeast Australia over two high flow events in March 2016 and August 2016. The variations in geochemistry imply that direct contribution of rainfall to streamflow was minor. Rather, the baseflow that sustained the streams prior to the events was augmented by water derived from the soils or regolith. A two component mass balance based on H-3 indicates that the soil/regolith water constituted 60-100% of total streamflow at the peak of the events. A mass balance based on silica yields similar estimates (50-70%). The H-3 activities of the soil water imply residence times of up to six years. These are sufficiently long for evapotranspiration, dissolution of organic matter, and mineral weathering to increase the major ion concentrations above those of rainfall and for mixing to homogenise delta O-18 and delta H-2 values. This study helps resolve the paradox that the water contributing to high flow events in streams is commonly not rainfall but is unlikely to be only increased inflows of groundwater due to the time required for hydraulic loading to occur.

TI Improving Bowen-ratio estimates of evaporation using a rejection

AB The application of the Bowen ratio method to estimate evaporation is heavily affected by uncertainties on the measured quantities. Time series collected with a hydro-meteorological monitoring station often contain measurements for which a reliable estimate of evaporation cannot be computed. Such measurements can be identified with standard error propagation methods. However, simply discarding some values might introduce a bias in the cumulative evaporation for long time intervals, also depending on the threshold of acceptance. In this paper, we propose the use of multiple-point statistics simulation to integrate the time series of reliable evaporation estimates. A test conducted on a two-year-long time series of data collected with a hydro-meteorological station in the Po plain (Italy) shows that the usage of a rejection criteria in conjunction with multiple point statistics simulation is a promising and useful tool for the reconstruction of reliable evaporation time series. In particular, it is shown that if the rejected values are not replaced by simulation, then the cumulative evaporation curves are estimated with a bias comparable with estimates of cumulative annual evaporation. Moreover, the test gives some insights for the selection of the best rejection threshold.

AB The goal of this study was to determine if assimilating a combination of various derived data products can help circumvent some of the difficulties associated with urban watershed modeling. Combinations of the SNODAS (Snow Data Assimilation System) snow water equivalent data, the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) L2 soil moisture, and streamflow observations were used for the data assimilation schemes. Combinations of these observation data sets were assimilated into lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff models of the highly-urbanized Don River basin (in southern Ontario) to determine if assimilation of geophysical variables will have a significant impact on simulations and forecasting in an urbanized watershed. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation method was used for these analyses, with various rainfall-runoff models that include GR4J, HyMod, MAC-HBV, and SAC-SMA models. The best data assimilation scheme for hydrologic modeling involved using a combination of streamflow, soil moisture, and snow water equivalent while performing both state and parameter updating. These results suggest that using a combination of soil moisture and snow water equivalent from the SMOS and SNODAS data products can improve simulations and ensemble forecasts in an urban basin.

TI A soil moisture estimation framework based on the CART algorithm and its
   application in China
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article

AB Soil moisture is an important parameter associated with the land-atmosphere interface and is highly influenced by multiple factors. Previous studies have provided an effective mechanism for accurately estimating soil moisture by building a global estimation model that comprehensively integrates multiple factors at a local scale. However, a global model is inefficient for accurately estimating soil moisture at a large or even global scale because of the complex surface features that make it difficult to fit data globally. Furthermore, inconsistencies in the spatial integrity between multisource data and the mismatch between the training space and application space decrease the generalizability of the model, which may lead to unreasonable soil moisture values in certain areas. This study proposes a "pyramid" framework that integrates multiple factors from different sources using the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm, a machine learning method, to estimate soil moisture at a high spatial resolution (1 km). The framework considers soil moisture as a response variable and several factors, such as precipitation, soil properties, and temperature, as explanatory variables. The framework uses piecewise fitting instead of global fitting and avoids the generation of unreasonable values. A k-fold cross-validation approach using "hold-out" years was used to assess the performance of the soil moisture estimation framework for the summer period. The results show that the performance of the framework was relatively stable during the study period with low variabilities in the r values (1 STD < 0.06) and error measures (1 STD < 0.05). The results predicted based on the framework are more accurate than the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) results. The correlation coefficients between the TVDI and soil moisture observations in June, July and August were 0.49, 0.29 and 0.49, respectively, whereas those between the predictions and observations were 0.70, 0.68 and 0.69, respectively, which reflected increases of 0.21, 0.39 and 0.20, respectively. The spatiotemporal analysis of summer soil moisture from 2000 to 2014 exhibited a significant wetting trend; the spatial patterns were characterized by wetting trends over arid and humid regions and drying trends over semi-arid regions. The results indicate that the "pyramid" framework can provide a soil moisture dataset with reasonable accuracy and high spatial resolution.

AB There is increasing recognition of the need to incorporate the complex and dynamic interactions between society and water in studies of water resource systems. The study of human-water dynamics requires the involvement of researchers from different disciplines, including hydrology and social science. This paper tracks recent trends in socio-hydrological research using quantitative and qualitative methods. Bibliographic metrics and network analysis are used to identify general trends and illustrate the internal connections in this small but growing interdisciplinary field. Results show that hydrologists dominate research in socio-hydrology as presently defined, with far less participation from social scientists. Research questions for socio-hydrology tend to focus on system dynamics and are often not framed in a way that engages the interests and expertise of social scientists. A qualitative analysis addresses key barriers to the interdisciplinary development of socio-hydrology and identifies research needs and directions for better integration of the human dimensions of water science. Attracting social scientists to this field requires a broader conceptualization of socio-hydrology to focus on sustainable development, risk assessment, hazard management, resilience, adaptation, and knowledge mobilization in addition to hydrology's traditional focus on systems modeling and decision support. We propose three themes for thematic focus: systemic risk and natural hazards; sustainability science; and adaptive governance. This broader framing of socio-hydrology is inherently more interdisciplinary, brings new methods and viewpoints to the field, and ensures that place-based local values are included in studies of water system dynamics.

AB A colorimetric method based on the development of the yellow potassium iodoantimonite complex, previously developed for biological matrices, was applied to successfully quantify total Sb in contaminated waters that were collected from an Sb mineralised zone in NSW, Australia. The method showed good repeatability and little interference from co-occurring ions such as As (III), Ca2+, Fe (III) and SO42-. Field testing demonstrated good precisions and recoveries, making the method truly quantitative under the given conditions. The method's detection limit and limit of reporting (0.6 mu g mL(-1)), made it applicable in areas of high Sb concentration and for rapid response to Sb contamination. Preliminary investigations into extending the method to rapid Sb speciation screening was trialled using anionic SPE columns that retained Sb (V) and excluded Sb (III), in isolation and in combined solutions. Antimony (V) retention was compromised in the presence of ions such as Ca2+ and SO42- spiked at realistic field concentrations. Despite this, the coupling of the colorimetric determination with the anionic columns showed no gross interferences during field trialling, and the columns showed potential for rapid screening of Sb species, as well as rapid preconcentration of Sb from water samples. The latter process lowered the effective detection limit of the colorimetric method almost 10-fold. Both the colorimetric method and the combination of this with rapid speciation techniques show great potential for expanding rapid Sb analysis capability, applicable especially for screening water samples with known or suspected Sb content.

AB Most lumped hydrological models use areal average precipitation data as model input. Though weather-radar-based and satellite-based precipitation estimation methods have been proposed in recent years, the rain gauge is still the most widely used precipitation-measuring tool. Optimal selection of rain gauge number and location will improve the accuracy of areal average precipitation estimations with minimum cost. In this study, the impacts of rain gauge density and distribution on lumped hydrological modelling uncertainty with different catchment sizes are analysed. To this end, the performances of a lumped hydrological model, the Xinanjiang model, in a densely gauged river basin, the Xiangjiang River basin, and its sub-basins under different gauge density and distribution are compared. First, seven levels of rain gauge density are defined. For each density level, several samples of different rain gauge distributions are randomly selected. Then, the areal average precipitation of each sample is estimated and used as input to the Xinanjiang model. Finally, the model is calibrated using the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm, and model uncertainty is evaluated via the Bayesian method. The results show that 1) imperfect precipitation inputs measured by a sparse and irregular rain gauge network will lead to substantial uncertainty in model parameter estimation and flood simulation; 2) the impacts of imperfect precipitation estimates on model efficiency can be reduced to some extent through the adjustment of model parameters; 3) modelling uncertainty is reduced by increasing the rain gauge density or optimizing the rain gauge distribution pattern; and 4) the improvement in lumped model efficiency is no longer significant when the rain gauge density exceeds a certain threshold, but a further increase in rain gauge density will reduce model parameter uncertainty and the width of the runoff confidence interval.

AB Dissolved carbon in lakes play a vital role in the global carbon cycling. The concentration and dynamics of lake dissolved carbon can be influenced by both the surrounding landscape and a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes within the lakes themselves. From 2009 to 2016, we conducted a large-scale assessment of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in 249 lakes across a diverse range of climatic, geopedologic, topographical and hydrological conditions in five Chinese limnetic regions: the East Limnetic Region (ELR), the Northeast Limnetic Region (NLR), the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Limnetic Region (MXR), the Yungui Limnetic Region (YGR), and the Tibet-Qinghai Limnetic Region (TQR). We found that the density of the organic matter in the soil in the surrounding landscape plays an important role in the DOC and DIC in lake water, as was evidenced by the high DOC and DIC levels in the NLR, where the soil is respectively organically rich. Conditions in the arid and semi-arid environments (i.e. TQR and MXR) have created a number of brackish/saline lakes and here we found that, DOC and DIC levels (median: 21.79 and 93.72 mg/L, respectively) are significantly higher than those in the freshwater lakes (median: 5.80 and 29.38 mg/L). It also appears to be the case that the trophic state of freshwater lakes influences the spatial variation of DOC. This can be seen in the relationships between DOC and trophic state index (TSI) in agriculturally-dominated regions such as the ELR (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.01), NLR (R-2 = 0.65, p < 0.001), and YGR (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001). Additionally, a close relationship between DOC and DIC can be found in lake waters with different trophic states (eutrophic: slp = 0.63, R-2 = 0.69; mesotrophic: slp = 1.03, R-2 = 0.65; oligotrophic: slp = 1.00, R-2 = 0.64). This indicates that human activities influence the quantity and quality of dissolved carbon in inland water across China.

AB Over the millennia, peatlands have sequestered and stored carbon in the form of peat, that today accounts for around 30% of the global soil organic carbon. The peat has formed and accumulated due to the slow decomposition rate of organic matter in waterlogged, anaerobic conditions. The particularly close interdependence of the carbon and water cycles in peatland ecosystems signal the importance of understanding the water cycle to the functioning of peatlands.
   With this aim, the water and energy cycle of an alpine catchment in Italy, which includes a peatland, was studied using the process-based hydrological model GEOtop and a set of in situ measurements over 4 years (2012-2015). This is a challenging modelling exercise that has not been tried before with GEOtop. The catchment is heterogenous with land covers of peatland, grassland, scree and bare rock in a mountainous area. The GEOtop model was able to replicate the energy and water fluxes measured by an eddy covariance tower located in the peatland as well as the volumetric water content and soil temperature of the peatland accurately over the four years. This study shows that a process-based hydrological model can be used to study the water and energy dynamics of a peatland in a mountainous area.

AB Performance of environmental justice models depends on the level of accuracy in measuring or estimating the health of the environment. In the past decades, and especially in the area of stream health modeling, significant improvement has been observed. However, the impacts of these improvements on the robustness of environmental justice models have not been evaluated. Therefore in this study, the relative importance of parameter estimation in stream health based environmental justice modeling was evaluated. The Saginaw River Basin in Michigan was considered as the study area, and four major ecological indices evaluating the response of fish and macroinvertebrates to instream stressors were used for stream health assessment. Seventeen socioeconomic and physiographic indices were evaluated at three census levels of county, census tract, and block group. Then the ecological, socioeconomic, and physiographic indices were used in the development of stream health based environmental justice models. Results showed that incorporating ecologically relevant indices and a using two-phase modeling approach not only improved the performance of stream health predictive models but also reduced the sensitivity of environmental justice models to aggregation at different census levels. In addition, using improved stream health indices reduced the redundancy of the independent variables (socioeconomic and physiographic indices), where the total number of significant parameters was reduced from 171 to 115. Besides that, more robust and meaningful spatial dependencies were observed among stream health measures and environmental justice parameters at different spatial levels. In summary having a reliable stream health information is the key for development of robust environmental justice models as evidence by improving model predictability and eliminating contradictory results compared to previous studies.

AB Efficient waste-load allocation plays a critical role in improving water quality. In this paper, a Pigovian tax-based waste-load allocation problem generalized from a prototype in the Tuojiang River basin is proposed. To control water quality and resolve the conflicts between dischargers, a Pigovian tax-based equilibrium strategy for waste-load allocation is designed to provide an optimization method for water quality management that fully considers the Stackelberg game between the environmental regulators and the river system dischargers. The successful application of this model to the Tuojiang River basin demonstrates its practicality and efficiency. Sensitivity analyses under different tax rate settings are given to provide the environmental regulators with insights into the impacts of a Pigovian tax policy on the discharger's BOD removal decisions, as well as to identify the waste-load allocation trade-offs between costs and equity. Compared to conventional models, the proposed method has the ability to reduce pollutants and achieve equitable waste-load allocations. The results demonstrated that as the proposed method can encourage dischargers to improve emissions performance, it could be of significant assistance to environmental decision making.

AB The evaporation method (EM) is an effective technique for measuring soil hydraulic properties. However, the EM generally fails to measure hydraulic conductivity curves (K-h; K and h are the hydraulic conductivity and the pressure head, respectively) in the wet (low suction) range when the hydraulic gradient within soil samples exceeds the minimum accuracy of the pressure transducer. In this study, we developed a new experimental device that uses the EM to perform conductivity measurements in the wet range. By making two major improvements, we successfully expanded the measurable range of K-h to cover the wet range, enabling accurate and effective measurements. Firstly, the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient measurement was remarkably improved by the use of a differential pressure transducer. Assuming the minimum evaporation speed (0.18 cm/day at the center of soil sample), the estimated measurable range of K-h is up to 27 cm/day for any type of soil. That is, our device has expanded the range of K-h measurable by the EM by more than two orders of magnitude on the wet end. Secondly, our device can execute the saturated/unsaturated steady-state infiltration method (SSIM/USIM) and the EM on the same sample. This diminishes not only time and cost but also errors between different methods, ensuring good accuracy and representativeness. The range of K-h measurable by the USIM was determined to be more than 21 cm/day, which overlaps with the range measurable by the EM. As a result, our device can obtain consecutive K-h curves from saturation to the medium pressure range (-500 < h <= 0 cm) for any type of soil.

AB HYPROP (Hydraulic Property Analyzer) system works based on the simplified evaporation method, which determines soil hydraulic properties in the laboratory. This system simultaneously monitors the changes in weight of soil samples as well as the soil matric potential at two depths throughout a drying process governed by evaporation from the soil surface. In this study, we examined the performance of the pseudo continuous pedotranfer function (PC-PTF) to estimate the soil water retention curve (SWRC) using high resolution data measured by HYPROP system. The dataset consisted of 7963 measured water retention data points obtained from 81 Turkish soil samples from which 60%, 20% and 20% were randomly selected for training, cross-validation and test subsets, respectively. The best PC-PTF developed in this study with a mean absolute error of 0.023 m(3) m(-3) (a root mean square error of 0.033 m(3) m(-3)) and a correlation coefficient of 0.96 showed promising performance considering the typical performance range (RMSE = 0.034-0.085 m(3) m(-3)) for parametric PTFs estimating SWRC. The best PC-PTF used soil textural information, soil bulk density, the percentage of stable aggregates, soil organic matter content and the initial water content as the input attributes. PTFs developed in this study also ranked high among previously developed PC-PTFs (with RMSE ranging from 0.027 to 0.056 m(3) m(-3)) using sparse datasets collected via the traditional equilibrium approach (i.e. sandbox apparatus/pressure plates extractor). We, therefore, recommend further application of the PC-PTF approach for development of PTFs using high resolution data obtained by HYPROP system.

AB Riparian wetlands as both hydrological and biogeochemical hot spots often have a major impact on the release of solutes from headwater catchments. Numerous studies give some evidence of a rather complex interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes that is still poorly understood. This study seeks to address this challenge using a multivariate solute concentration data set from a small riparian headwater wetland. First, a non-linear variant of the Principal Component Analysis (Isomap) was performed in a preceding study to identify prevailing biogeochemical processes controlling water chemistry. Second, the scores of the components of the stream draining the wetland were subjected to a cluster analysis to identify typical biogeochemical patterns for different biogeochemical and hydrological boundary conditions.
   Four different clusters could be identified, which roughly followed a seasonal pattern, although modified by hydrological boundary conditions in the short-term. During the first three months of the year, Cluster 3 prevailed, indicating a discharge of rather unaltered shallow to mean depth groundwater. Cluster 3 was increasingly replaced by Cluster 2 and then subsequently by Cluster 1, indicating increasingly anoxic conditions, increasing denitrification and desulphurization, and increasing decomposition of organic carbon reflecting increasing biological activity and increasing water residence time within the wetland. However, stream water during stormflow after extended periods of low groundwater level in the second half of the growth season exhibited a very distinct pattern, represented by the fourth cluster. It indicated strong oxic conditions causing enhanced oxidation of sulphides, a corresponding decrease in pH values, and a substantial increase in the concentration of alkaline earth ions, manganese and in electric conductivity during the dry period.
   It is concluded that temporal variations in stream water chemistry clearly reflected the intensity of biological activity in the wetland, interacting with water table dynamics. Our results provide strong evidence for major effects of single extreme events like drought periods which are expected to become more frequent because of climate change.

AB Weather and climatic characterization of rainfall extremes is both of scientific and societal value for hydro meteorological risk management, yet discrimination of local and large-scale forcing remains challenging in data scarce environments. Here, we present an analysis framework that separates weather regime and climate controls using data-driven process identification. The approach is based on signal-to-noise separation methods and explanatory extreme value (EV) modeling of multisite rainfall extremes. The EV models integrate the temporal component of the weather/climate driver using semi-automatic parameter identification. At weather scale, the EV models are combined with a state-based Markov model to represent the spatiotemporal structure of rainfall as weather states. At climate scale, the EV models are used to search for drivers leading to the shift of weather patterns. The drivers are brought out in a climate-to-weather signal subspace, built via dimension reduction of climate model reconstructions.
   We apply the framework to a complex terrain region: the Western Andean Ridge in Ecuador and Peru (0-6 degrees S) using ground data from the second half of the 20th century. Overall, we show that the framework, which does not make any prior assumption on the explanatory power of the weather and climate drivers, allows identification of well-known and new features of the regional climate in a purely data-driven fashion. Thus, the approach shows potential to identify weather controls on precipitation extremes in data-scarce and orographically complex regions in which model reconstructions are the only climate proxies.

AB Many recent studies propose wavelet-based hydrological and water resources forecasting models that have been incorrectly developed and that cannot properly be used for real-world forecasting problems. The incorrect development of these wavelet-based forecasting models occurs during wavelet decomposition (the process of extracting high- and low-frequency information into different sub-time series known as wavelet and scaling coefficients, respectively) and as a result introduces error into the forecast model inputs. The source of this error is due to the boundary condition that is associated with wavelet decomposition (and the wavelet and scaling coefficients) and is linked to three main issues: 1) using 'future data' (i.e., data from the future that is not available); 2) inappropriately selecting decomposition levels and wavelet filters; and 3) not carefully partitioning calibration and validation data. By not addressing these boundary conditions during wavelet decomposition, incorrectly developed wavelet-based forecasting models often result in much better performance than what is realistically achievable. We demonstrate that the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) multiresolution analysis (DWT-MRA) and maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) multiresolution analysis (MODWT-MRA), two commonly adopted wavelet decomposition methods used in the development of hydrological and water resources wavelet-based forecasting models, suffer from these boundary conditions and cannot be used properly for real-world forecasting. However, by following a proposed set of best (correct) practices, we show that the MODWT and a trous algorithm (AT) can be used to correctly forecast target (e.g., hydrological and water resources) processes in real-world scenarios. In this vein, we contribute a set of best practices, which focusses on deriving "boundary-corrected" wavelet and scaling coefficients from time series data, overcoming the boundary condition issues and providing hydrological and water resources modellers with a justified and coherent strategy for developing wavelet-based forecasting models that may be used for real-world forecasting problems. We coalesce these best practices into a new forecasting framework named Wavelet Data-Driven Forecasting Framework (WDDFF) that uses a combination of input variable selection and data-driven models to convert "boundary-corrected" wavelet and scaling coefficients into forecasts of a target process. Through a real-world urban water demand forecasting experiment in Montreal, Canada, we demonstrate the superiority of WDDFF against benchmark forecasting models such as (non-wavelet-based) random walk, multiple linear regression, extreme learning machine, and second-order Volterra series models. For the same case study, we also show how the WDDFF provides realistic and accurate forecasts while a recently proposed wavelet-based forecasting model that adopts the (invalid) MODWT-MRA for wavelet decomposition provides incorrect and unrealistic forecasts. We conclude that WDDFF is a useful tool for forecasting real-world hydrological and water resources processes that overcomes the limitations of many earlier wavelet-based forecasting methods and should be explored further for forecasting different processes such as streamflow, rainfall, evaporation, etc.

AB Studies of moisture dynamics associated with major tropical rain activities with the aid of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic (delta O-18 and delta D) measurements in precipitation and water vapour are of current research interest. Here we present such measurements of rain and water vapour samples collected at two tropical coastal hill stations of southern peninsular India during April October, 2012. An apparent seasonal cycle is observed both in rain and vapour isotopes. Despite of the isotopic equilibrium observed between rain and vapour during the whole sampling period, it often deviates in sub seasonal time scales. Rain-vapour isotopic separation factors are lower compared to the equilibrium separation values during stratiform rain events of Indian summer monsoon, while the separation factors are close to the equilibrium values during convective events. This is possibly due to the decreased vertical mixing of moisture during stratiform rain events.

AB Non-rainfall events like dew or hoar frost formation are often neglected in the water budget, because either assumed to be too small or their determination requires time consuming and difficult measurements. These events supply in many dryland ecosystems a substantial amount of water, but their role for northern humid ecosystems is largely unknown. There is a general need to quantify the ecological relevance for ecosystems of the water amount from dew and hoar frost formation. Weighable precision lysimeters were used to determine dew and hoar frost formation for a low mountain range and alpine grassland site for the hydrological years 2013-2015.
   Together dew and hoar frost formation ranged on a yearly basis between 42.1 and 67.7 mm, which corresponds to 4.2-6% of the total annual amount of precipitation. In drier months dew and hoar frost contributed up to 16.1% of total monthly precipitation amount. In winter months dew and hoar frost formation contributed up to 38% to the total monthly precipitation amount. Our investigation suggests, that dew and hoar frost formation are of ecological importance during droughts as well as cold periods. The amounts and seasonal patterns of dew and hoar frost formation could be predicted relatively well, based on standard meteorological variables with the Penman-Monteith equation. However, our results also showed, that the surface energy balance model from Penman-Monteith underestimated the amount of dew and hoar frost during colder periods and specific meteorological site conditions (i.e. high wind speeds at night). The mean underestimation between calculated and measured dew and hoar frost on a yearly scale were 63.2% and 16.6% at Rollesbroich and Gumpenstein, respectively. Dew and hoar frost formation contributes substantially to the water budgets of a low mountain range and alpine grassland.

AB Using data from 22 catchments in Northern Finland, this study demonstrates how runoff prediction in ungauged high-latitude catchments can be improved using simplified conceptual models tailored to readily available data in the region. The newly developed current precipitation index (CPIsnow) model provides a parsimonious tool to predict streamflow in data-limited high-latitude regions. Use of current precipitation index (CPI) and runoff coefficient formulation in the soil moisture and response routine conceptualization makes soil moisture and response routine parameters in the model identifiable with catchment properties influencing storage, evapotranspiration, and infiltration losses. Most of the model parameters showed a significant relationship with observable physical catchment properties, climate properties, or both. This made it easier to estimate the values of the model parameters in an ungauged catchment with minimal uncertainty. The parameter functional relationships derived with catchment attributes produced equally good model results when applied to independent test catchments. Inclusion of snow-water equivalent records and use of multiple objective functions for both snow-water equivalent and runoff simulations in the model optimization process helped reduce the effect of parameter equifinality, thereby making it easier to determine the optimal parameter values. Ranges of parameter values are proposed for the CPIsnow model in relation to key observable catchment characteristics in the boreal zone, enabling application of the model in ungauged catchments in the region.

AB River bank erosion is controlled by a complex combination of factors and processes that play a main role in fluvial dynamics. However, the role played by lateral erosion in small low energy rivers functioning still needs to be better understood. This study deals with the characterization and the quantification of the bank erosion of a small low energy river of the Seine Basin (France) in periurban catchment where urbanization had led to an incision and widening of the bed in the past decades, using adapted monitoring surveys: erosion pins and Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry. The paper provides an opportunity to compare reach-scale flux estimates using both techniques. Spatial and temporal variations in river bank rates were quantified over 16 months and the causes and controls of riverbank erosion were identified. The estimated morphological activity rate ranges from 117 cm/yr to 1 cm/yr, illustrating the very heterogeneous spatio-temporal pattern of bank erosion observed on the Merantaise River. Whereas a number of studies consider subaerial processes as the dominant processes, fluvial erosion was found to be the most significant causal process, and in particular the mean discharge of floods. However, the high local variability of the bank erosion of the studied river appears to be controlled by very local factors such as the bank angle, the presence of a berm at the bank-toe (providing protection against fluvial erosion), lateral supply (outlet of rainwater pipes) and deflected flow in the direction of the bank.

AB The prevailing opinion on the temporal origin of water in a hillslope stormflow hydrograph is that the pre-event water represents a dominant fraction. Such conclusion is usually based on hydrograph separation techniques using stable water isotopes (or other conservative tracers) in conjunction with a mass balance approach. In this study, a two-dimensional dual-continuum model was used to study preferential flow of water and transport of Oxygen-18 (O-18) in a vertical cross-section of a hillslope located in a temperate spruce forest. The effects of hydrodynamic mixing and the spatiotemporal variability of isotopic signatures on estimated pre-event/event water fractions in the hillslope discharge were studied by means of numerical simulation experiments. Pre-event and event water contributions to hillslope stormflow were evaluated using a two-component mass balance approach combined with the 2D flow and transport simulations involving real as well as synthetic O-18 signatures. Long-term simulations of O-18 transport in the hillslope segment were compared with the observed O-18 content in soil water and in the hillslope effluent. The results of the long-term simulations indicated significant mixing of pre-event and event water occurring near the subsurface trench and in the soil above the soil bedrock interface where the transfer of O-18 from the soil matrix to the preferential pathways takes place. Despite the dominant role of preferential flow in the generation of hillslope stormflow, the pre-event water formed 52-84% of total subsurface stormflow. The mass balance approach failed in partitioning the hillslope discharge into the pre-event/event water components for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes due to similar natural isotopic signatures of pre-event and event water. The analysis showed that spatially and temporally variable exchange of O-18 between the soil matrix and preferential pathways exerted a primary control on the estimates of the temporal origin of water in the hillslope runoff. It was demonstrated that the degree of hydrodynamic mixing in the flow domain played an important role in the interpretation of the isotope-based hydrograph separation.

AB The introduction of cash crops and the evolution of farming practices in the uplands of Southeast Asia have drastically changed the agricultural landscape of the region during these last decades. This evolution has significantly increased soil erosion leading to important on and off-site effects. A long-term multi-scale monitoring of soil erosion was initiated in the early 2000's in the Houay Pano catchment located near the city of Luang Prabang in Northern Laos to assess these effects and propose sustainable land management solutions. We report here the analysis and the modelling of the soil erosion measurements made during the whole period on 1m(2) plots for different land uses. As expected, land use has an important impact on runoff production and soil erosion. The mean annual runoff coefficient increased from 0.05 for established fallow (4 years) to 0.45 for old teak trees plantation (14 years) with intermediate values for crops. The mean soil loss followed the same trend with respect to land use, from 25 g m(-2) y(-1) to 3765 g m(-2) y(-1). These measurements confirm that established fallow promotes infiltration and reduces erosion and, at the opposite, teak tree increases soil crusting, lowers the infiltration rate and enhances soil detachment. The splash and wash erosion component of a process-oriented model developed for terrace erosion was used. This model describes the soil loss after a rainfall event as the product of an effective soil detachability, the rainfall kinetic energy, the runoff coefficient and different attenuation factors linked to soil surface features. The agreement is good, both at the event and the yearly scales. When aggregated by land use, surface features percentages have low standard deviations and soil detachability variability may be described by a log-normal distribution. This suggests that each land use has a unique signature in the erosion process given by the percentages and the distribution. We conclude that: (i) leaving the litter layer and an understorey in crops and trees plantations is the best way to minimize soil erosion, and (ii) the splash and wash model may be helpful to set up optimal agronomic strategies for a sustainable land use of Southeast Asia uplands.

AB The use of water temperature as a tracer has been widely utilized for characterizing the dynamics of water flow and heat transport in riparian zones. By using experimental approaches, we investigated the effects of water temperature, hydraulic head, and heat radiation on water flow and thermal dynamics in riparian zones through sand tank experiments, which simulate the dynamics of water flow and heat transport in riparian zones. Water of low temperature was pumped into the sand tank, and changes of temperature at different locations of the sand tank were measured. Temperature data was examined for three different water temperatures (4.0 degrees C, 6.0 degrees C, and 9.5 degrees C), two different hydraulic heads (25 cm and 45 cm), and two different radiation temperatures (no radiation and 22 degrees C). The thermal dynamic variation pattern in different types of water temperatures, hydraulic heads, and radiation combinations, was also analyzed using a HYDRUS-2D model. The temperature sensors, located near the inlet infiltration boundary, required a shorter time to reach the steady state, because the temperature declined more rapidly near the inlet. The effect of lateral inflow on the temperature gradient was obvious. The temperature gradient in the horizontal direction gradually decreased, and the vertical temperature gradient gradually increased. In the initial stage of infiltration, the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction was larger than the temperature gradient in the vertical direction, however, as time goes on, the temperature gradient in the vertical direction was larger than the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction. In addition, the horizontal temperature gradient of the top sand layer was less affected by the water temperature. The closer the temperature observation point of the same horizontal section was to the infiltration boundary, the higher the rate of temperature difference changes. Comparison of the predicted and observed thermal dynamics variation of the 2-D sand tank shows good agreement, indicating that the major mechanism for water flow and thermal dynamics variation was hydraulic head. The sensitivity analysis results illustrate that the model was most sensitive to hydraulic head (H), followed by Van Genuchten parameter (alpha), permeability coefficient (K-S), water temperature (T), Van Genuchten parameter (n), residual moisture content (theta(r)), and saturated moisture content (theta(S)). The variation of each parameter was linear with the change of temperature field. Parameters which were positively related to the temperature field were T, alpha, theta(r) and theta(S), which means the parameter value becomes larger as the temperature becomes larger, and vice versa. The parameters which were negatively related to the temperature field were H, K-S and n.

AB The Linearized Parabolic Approximation of the Saint Venant Equations is often used for flood routing, but the corresponding analytic solutions usually neglect the downstream boundary conditions. This is an issue because the presence of hydraulic structures at the end of a river reach, or natural morphologic conditions, may influence the wave propagation. In order to take into account realistic boundary conditions, namely a stage-hydrograph upstream and a stage-discharge relationship downstream, a new set of exact solutions of the Linearized Parabolic Approximation of the Saint Venant Equations with uniformly distributed lateral inflows is presented. This exact solution is demonstrated by using it as a building block in a simplified flood routing model, whose numerical results are compared with those supplied by laboratory experiments from literature. Finally, the new solutions are used to analyze the range of validity of semi-infinite channel models. The comparison shows that semi infinite channel models are accurate when convective effects are prevailing on diffusive effects, and the downstream boundary condition corresponds to uniform flow conditions. In addition, the results show that semi infinite channel models based on the knowledge of the upstream stage-hydrograph can predict flow depths better than those making use of a flow hydrograph, while being practically equivalent in predicting flow rates.

AB This study focuses on the identification of the lateral preferential flow at the hillslope scale and the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast-flow region, K-s,K-f based on infiltration experiments carried out at different spatial scales (point- and plot-scales), and at different soil depths. The discrepancies between the considered scales were mainly attributed to macropore flow and the difficulty in adequately embodying the macropore network on small sampled soil volumes. Conversely, at the plot-scale, the sampled volume was sufficient to activate the macropore network. This information helped establish the usability of a given technique to determine the parameters describing the hydraulic properties of the soil in the matrix and fast-flow regions. While K-s data obtained from the Beerkan method with the Beerkan Estimation of soil Transfer (BEST) parameter algorithm (point-scale) were used to describe the matrix (K-s,K-m), the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast flow region was estimated using the soil block method (plot-scale). Estimated K-s,K-f values were one to three orders of magnitude higher than K-s,K-m. The overall decrease of K-s,K-f with the soil depth supported the hypothesis that the macropore density decreased as a function of depth, yielding higher macropore flow variability. The soil block method, in association with the Beerkan infiltration runs, allowed the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast-flow region based on a relatively simple field procedure.

AB Spatial and temporal influences on the winter (December-March) stormflow characteristics of fifteen United States Geological Survey (USGS)-gaged watersheds in the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains are identified: (1) watershed-scale differences in geomorphology; (2) continental-scale teleconnections during periods of wetness/dryness (based on the relative amount of winter precipitation over a consistent 20 year dataset); and (3) land cover in the context of soil parent material (e.g., development on alluvium/colluvium). Multiple regression was used to determine how much variance could be explained in five hydrologic variables describing the flashiness of peak flow (three original metrics), total seasonal flashiness (Richards Baker flashiness index), and the ratio of total winter stormflow to total discharge (the stormflow index). Models were constrained to three uncorrelated (vertical bar 0.65 vertical bar) variables to prevent overfitting to the dataset. Average-, dry-, and wet-years were subset using the z-scores for winter precipitation derived from the 4 km monthly PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) dataset, for the period of 1986-2006. Relief, slope, and landscape connectivity explain the majority of explained variance in all five of the hydrologic variables during all time periods. During dry-, average-, and wet-years, atmospheric circulation patterns (i.e., North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific/North American Pattern) explain more variance than total seasonal precipitation (PRISM), which is not true in the majority of the all-years models. Land cover explains only a small portion of the variance in regional stormflow and only when sub-divided based on soil parent material. Results provide a framework for connecting watershed-scale characteristics to regional- and continental-scale processes.

AB Rapid urbanization is considered to be an important factor that contributes to flood risk. Therefore, flood prediction in urban watersheds using appropriate runoff models is essential to avoid the harmful effects of floods. There are various storage function (SF) models such as Kimura, Prasad, Hoshi, and urban storage function (USF) models that have been widely used in different parts of the world as rainfall-runoff models in which the USF model was recently developed in Japan for the specific application in urban watersheds. However, the identification of an appropriate model remains challenging in the field of hydrology. Therefore, this study aims to identify an effective SF model for an urban watershed in terms of hydrograph reproducibility and from an Akaike information criterion (AIC) perspective. The SCE-UA global optimization method was used for the parameter optimization of each model with root mean square error (RMSE) as the objective function. The reproducibility of the hydrograph was evaluated using the performance evaluation criteria of RMSE, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and other error functions of peak, volume, time to peak, lag time, and runoff coefficient. The results revealed that the higher values of NSE coupled with the lower values of RMSE and other error functions indicated that the hydrograph reproducibility of USF is the highest among the SF models. Furthermore, AIC and Akaike weight (AW) were used to identify the most effective model among all those based on the information criteria perspective. The USF model received the lowest AIC score and the highest AW during most of the events, which indicates that it is the most parsimonious model compared to the other SF models. Moreover, uncertainty characterization of the SF model parameters was also conducted to analyze the effect of each parameter on model performance.

AB Skilful forecasting of monthly streamflow in intermittent rivers is a challenging task in stochastic hydrology. In this study, genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with gene expression programming (GEP) as a new hybrid model for month ahead streamflow forecasting in an intermittent stream. The hybrid model was named GEP-GA in which sub-expression trees of the best evolved GEP model were rescaled by appropriate weighting coefficients through the use of GA optimizer. Auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation functions of the streamflow records as well as evolutionary search of GEP were used to identify the optimum predictors (i.e., number of lags) for the model. The proposed methodology was demonstrated using monthly streamflow data from the Shavir Creek in Iran. Performance of the GEP-GA was compared to that of classic genetic programming (GP), GEP, multiple linear regression and GEP-linear regression models developed in the present study as the benchmarks. The results showed that the GEP-GA outperforms all the benchmarks and motivated to be used in practice.

AB Velocity distributions for open channel flows have been investigated using deterministic and probabilistic approaches. It is well known that the vertical velocity profiles in wide open channels (i.e. aspect ratio width/depth > 5) can be approximated by logarithmic velocity laws and power laws. Recently the entropy concept in the forms of Shannon entropy and Tsallis entropy has been employed to estimate velocity distributions in open channels with different aspect ratios. The accuracy of conventional velocity equations is highly dependent on their parameters that can only be estimated by empirical or semi-empirical analytical relations which requires either a good knowledge of velocity field and/or physical properties of the channel, such as topographic conditions, sedimentation conditions and boundary roughness. In contrast, the entropy based velocity distributions derived based on the least-biased probability density function (PDF) by treating time-averaged velocities as random variables are resilient regardless of the flow and channel conditions. However, a comparison of the velocity profiles computed using deterministic approaches and probabilistic approaches has not been rigorously conducted. Furthermore, the accuracy and reliability of associated velocity distribution equations have not been tested thoroughly using data sets collected using advanced techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive and comparative study to analyze the distinctions and linkages between four commonly used velocity laws and two entropy-based velocity distributions theoretically and quantitatively using selective laboratory and field measurements available in the literature, considering typical sedimentation and channel hydraulic conditions. Amongst all, Tsallis entropy based velocity distribution developed from a generalized form of informational entropy exhibits universal validity to sediment-laden flows in wide alluvial open channels, and is found to be superior to others to predict velocity profiles in large waterways with unmanageable rough beds.

AB Although umpteen studies are available in the hydrologic literature for modeling the contaminant transports under steady flow conditions, similar trend is not seen while modeling this process under unsteady flow conditions and, thereby, limiting their field application for pollution monitoring in semi-gauged rivers. In this study, three simple model variants, namely, VPMM-AD(Psi D-c), VPMM-AD(Phi D-f) and VPMM-AD(D-c) were developed for unsteady state contaminant routing by tight-coupling the physically-based Variable Parameter McCarthy-Muskingum (VPMM) flow-transport sub-model with the Advection-Dispersion (AD) contaminant-transport sub model. These model variants were extensively tested under unsteady and steady flow conditions using the numerical experiments, and USGS laboratory and real-world river application datasets considering the popular MIKE11-AD model as the benchmark. The study results revealed the consistent superior performance of the VPMM-AD(psi D-c) and VPMM-AD(Phi D-f) model variants over the benchmark model. The developed approach is a novel one as it is fully physically-based, free from numerical stability problem as the governing equations are solved iteratively, can work at meso-scale with the same computational space and time-steps in the flow and solute routings compatible with the spatiotemporal scales of observation, very simple to use, and do not compromise with the routing accuracy as encountered in the benchmark hydrodynamic model even with a fully implicit finite difference scheme.

AB Soil water availability has a strong role on vegetation conservation and biodiversity, particularly at vulnerable environments such as archipelagos, subject to significant temporal changes of climate and rainfall, which influence soil weathering and erosion processes. Few field studies on hydrology of volcanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean have been developed focusing on soil and water temporal dynamics and conservation, mainly because such studies require data with high temporal resolution, and also due to the financial costs involved with field data acquisition at such remote places. Considering the importance of soil moisture content to several hydrological processes and islands environmental sustainability, this study aimed to investigate the soil water temporal dynamics in relation to different rainfall patterns and also the rainfall erosivity and its temporal variation, and the resulting infiltration depths, during a typical hydrological period, in an experimental plot at the main watershed of Fernando de Noronha, in the Brazilian Atlantic Coast. Rainfall was recorded every 5 min, and soil moisture was intensely monitored by 16 moisture probes, installed at 10-40 cm and 40-70 cm layers, during three years, representing the typical local hydrological regime and seasons. Rainfall bursts pattern were identified and described. Experimental data allowed a hydrological model to be calibrated and validated, providing estimates of infiltration depths, which can be valuable for water resources planning and management. Hydrological patterns were determined for each erosive rainfall, depending on the precipitation peak position, as advanced, intermediate and delayed. The soil water effectiveness was also evaluated and related to the different rainfall patterns. Soil moisture is highest from April to June, close to saturation; whilst for the other months the values were close to the residual value. The rainfall erosivity in the archipelago was identified as moderate to strong, and the most frequent rainfall pattern was the advanced. Fast wetting-drying cycles during the rainfall events were observed, due to rainfall intermittency, evapotranspiration, and to soil hydraulic conductivity. It was observed the prevalence of high moisture indexes, with percentages higher than 40% (extremely effective level) for both investigated depths within the first 70 cm of soil, essential for plant water uptake. The observed rainfall erosivity highlights the importance of defining local strategies for soil and water conservation aimed at water security in the island. Based on a simulation model, which was successfully calibrated (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Index NS = 0.76) and validated (NS = 0.81) for periods in the wet season, high infiltration depths have been identified, which contributes to canopy conservation in the archipelago.

AB Marginal likelihood (or Bayesian evidence) estimation is the basis for model evaluation and model selection, which is the key research content of the uncertainty quantification of groundwater model structure. Recently, the nested sampling estimator (NSE) has been widely used as an efficient method to estimate the marginal likelihood. The Metropolis-Hasting (M-H) algorithm is usually used to explore the model likelihood space for NSE. However, M-H is inefficient in searching complex likelihood functions, especially for the multimodal distribution functions, because of the sampling structure of M-H algorithm. The multi-try differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (MT-DREAMzs) algorithm is effective and robust in searching complex probability space, and it is incorporated into NSE to improve the performance of marginal likelihood estimation in this study. In addition, the developed MT-DREAMzs-based NSE (NSE MT) is evaluated by comparing with several other marginal likelihood estimators including DREAMzs-based and M-H-based NSEs (NSE_DR, NSE_MH), Gaussian mixture importance (GAME) sampling and a new nested sampling algorithm (PolyChord). Based on three analytical functions (up to 100 dimensions) and one groundwater solute transport case studies, the results showed that NSE MT outperforms NSEMH in the convergence, efficiency and accuracy of marginal estimation, and NSE_MT is slightly more efficient and accurate than NSE_DR. The accuracy of NSE_MH, NSE_DR and NSE_MT deteriorates with increasing dimensionality of target distributions/model parameters. In addition, GAME sampling and PolyChord sampling outperform other three NSEs in the accuracy and stability of estimation for high dimensional (up to 100-variate) distributions, and PolyChord is slightly less accurate and stable than GAME. Compared with GAME and PolyChord, NSE_MT and NSE_DR are competent for less than 10-dimensional distributions with higher computational efficiency.

AB Rainfall-induced shallow landslide is a common geological hazard around the world that can pose serious threat to both lives and property. Previous studies suggested that rainfall induced shallow landslides always occurred either above the bottom of a downward wetting front in infiltration, or below a rising water table. This paper proposed a different mechanism of shallow landslides in a modelling approach. The comprehensive physics-based Integrated Hydrology Model (InHM) and the infinite slope stability model were employed on a virtual slope to simulate the hydrologic response and estimate the slope stability. Different failure mechanisms with various characteristics were investigated under diverse rainfall scenarios (i.e., various combinations of rainfall depths, durations and temporal patterns). The results showed a novel mechanism of shallow landslides: a significant vertical change in saturated hydrologic conductivity causes the accumulation of infiltrated water, and subsequently leading to an increase pore pressures and landslides in unsaturated soil layer. More importantly, this kind of landslide would bring larger landslide volume even with smaller total rainfall depths. This study expanded our understanding about landslides and had important application in alleviating the loss of lives and property.

AB Temporal variation of water in the vadose zone is important to understand processes such as solute transport and nutrient cycling. Measurements of soil water content (SWC) in the subsurface are less common than those near the surface and predictions using numerical models are limited by data availability. Wavelet decomposition of surface measurements of SWC could improve modeling of subsurface SWC by segregating features at different temporal scales and projecting them to the subsurface. The objectives of this work were to: 1) predict subsurface SWC using surface SWC and a combination of wavelet analysis and linear regression, and 2) investigate relationships between soil properties and the movement of soil water at various temporal scales, s. Climate data and SWC at various depths were collected from eight sites in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA. Soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity (k) functions of each horizon were optimized by comparing measured and predicted (using HYDRUS-1D) soil water contents. Each time series of SWC was decomposed into 50 scale components using the Mexican Hat wavelet and later reduced to 5 group components with minimal impact on the characteristics of the signal. Changes in the values of each group component with depth were represented with transfer coefficients that could be estimated with predictors derived from particle size distributions and optimized soil hydraulic functions. Prediction depth and saturated k were the two most important predictors for s < 256 h, while k at -10 kPa was the best predictor for 256 h < s < 724 h, and the median value of particle size diameters for s > 724 h. Subsurface soil water content can be reasonably predicted with the proposed approach, particularly when vertical movement of soil water is unrestricted.

ID SALTWATER INTRUSION; SHARP-INTERFACE; VULNERABILITY
AB Previous studies on the impact of sea-level rise (SLR) on seawater intrusion (SWI) are mostly based on the assumption of a homogeneous coastal aquifer. In this study, we extend those studies by investigating SLR-induced SWI in a layered coastal aquifer using the analytical method developed by Strack and Ausk (2015). We provide analytical solutions for steady-state SWI in confined and unconfined coastal aquifers, where both constant-head and constant-flux inland boundary conditions are considered. The analysis based on a three-layer aquifer indicates that in general aquifer stratification affects either or both the initial location and response distance of the interface toe. Specifically, for flux-controlled unconfined coastal systems, the toe response distance driven by SLR is a linear function of the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer and independent of hydraulic conductivities of lower layers. Using an equivalent homogeneous hydraulic conductivity (derived based on the initial interface toe location before SLR) would result in overestimation or underestimation of the toe response distance, depending on the hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the layers. For flux-controlled confined layered coastal systems, by contrast, SLR can not cause variation of the steady-state interface toe location, which is consistent with previous findings for homogeneous coastal aquifers. The interface toe location in head-controlled layered coastal systems is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers. Moreover, the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location and response distance in the head controlled system exhibits a more complicated pattern than in the flux-controlled coastal system, as changing the layer thickness changes both the overall aquifer transmissivity and inland freshwater flux. The results obtained enhance the understanding of the impact of SLR on SWI, which could provide a first-order assessment tool for relevant practitioners.

AB A typical engineered flood protection for a community exposed to fluvial flooding is constructions of flood defense dedicated for public-wide protection. Over the past few years, there have been efforts to mainstreaming individual precautionary measures as to reduce risk of flooding. Consideration of individual protection measures alongside public protection measures is mainly to increase resistance of local communities to flood impacts whilst deliberating the spatial constraints of public protection measures and optimizing cost of adaptation. However, quantification of vulnerability and risk reduction of combined public and individual protection measures has not received much attention, far less a risk-based economic analysis. In assisting flood risk management decision making, a systematic approach to quantify vulnerability and flood risk of conditions with the combined protection measures is deemed crucial. This study proposes a methodology to assess vulnerability and flood risk of flooding considering combined public and individual protection measures, aiming for relevant applications in economic appraisal of local protection options. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated using a case study of a residential area of Teddington near the Greater London. A range of different possible levels of protection was also included to exemplify the usefulness of the methodology in search for an optimal protection level. The results show that the combined public and individual protection can reduce flood risk significantly. The study highlights that the methodology can serve as a tool for a practical and manageable vulnerability and flood risk assessment.

AB Statistical calibration of flow and transport models in unsaturated porous media is often carried out with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. However, the practicality of these methods is limited by their computational requirement, particularly when large prior intervals are assigned to the model parameters. In this work, a new operational strategy is investigated to alleviate the computational burden of MCMC samplers using results from a preliminary calibration performed with the First-Order Approximation (FOA) method. With the new strategy, the posterior distribution is approximated using a high-order Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) surrogate model constructed over reduced parameter ranges. The latter are obtained from the 99.9 FOA confidence intervals.
   Two challenging test cases are investigated to assess efficiency and accuracy of the new strategy. The first test case considers estimation of flow and pesticide transport parameters from a synthetic infiltration experiment. The second test case deals with the assessment of unsaturated hydraulic soil parameters from a real-word laboratory drainage experiment. The results of the proposed strategy are compared to those of FOA, of the standard MCMC method and of an improved MCMC method in which the sampler is preconditioned with draws from the FOA posterior distribution. For both test cases, the new strategy provides accurate mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty regions and is much more efficient than the other MCMC methods. It is up to 50 times more efficient than the standard MCMC method.

AB Underground pumped storage hydropower (UPSH) using abandoned mines is an alternative system to manage electricity production in flat regions. Water from an underground reservoir is pumped to a surface reservoir to store electricity in the form of potential energy. Later, water is discharged through turbines into the underground reservoir to produce electricity when demand increases. During this operation, the water hydrochemistry continuously evolves. It varies in order to reach chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere (in the surface reservoir) and with the surrounding porous medium and groundwater (in the underground reservoir). The hydrochemical variations may lead to reactions in the reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium, causing potentially negative consequences for the environment and the system efficiency, especially when pyrite is present in the surrounding porous medium. In this case, pyrite oxidation leads to a decrease in pH and the precipitation of goethite or schwertmannite in the surface reservoir. The decrease in pH is mitigated when calcite is present in the porous medium. However, other concerns may arise, such as slight increases in pH, the precipitation of ferrihydrite and calcite in the surface reservoir, and the oxidation of pyrite and dissolution of calcite in the surrounding porous medium. Understanding the pH variations and the precipitation/dissolution of minerals is of paramount importance in terms of the environmental impacts and system efficiency. For this reason, this work investigates the main hydrochemical changes and their associated consequences when abandoned deep mines are used for UPSH by means of numerical modelling. The main objective is to highlight the importance of considering hydrochemical aspects when designing future UPSH plants.

AB Sub-daily variations in the rates and dominance of the main controls of stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (production, mobility and instream processes) have the potential to create a subtle sub-daily rhythm of DOC variation in streams. We used high-frequency data, covering the spring-summer-autumn period, which included discharge, specific conductivity, pH, groundwater levels, temperature, evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving diel DOC cycles in northern catchments. We focused on a peatland dominated 1st order stream (0.65 km(2)) before investigating the propagation of the signals downstream to a 2nd order stream (3.2 km(2)), with a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel. DOC cycles in the 1st order stream had a median peak time of 14:00 h and temporally varying amplitude, with a median of 0.61 mgl(-1). Results supported the hypothesis that diel DOC cycles at the site are driven by hydrological processes, specifically the viscosity-effect theory: viscosity-driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon flush DOC from the peat to the stream. The temporal variability in the amplitude of the diel DOC cycle was controlled by antecedent temperature. Downstream, the did DOC signal was weaker, with around 4-fold lower amplitudes and minima in the afternoon. The lower proportion of riparian peat downstream appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes on DOC cycles. In-stream photodegradation and decomposition likely became more dominant as connectivity between DOC sources and stream reduced. The study highlighted that even in climates such as the Scottish Highlands, where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent, sub-daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur. Unravelling the intricacy of such diel cycles is fundamental to fully understanding stream functioning and the global carbon cycle.

AB Floods are considered as one of the most frequently occurring natural hazards worldwide and are occurring increasingly frequent in recent decades. Flood risk assessment is an important tool for flood prevention and involves significant practical applications in flood risk management and flood disaster reduction. In the study, an integrated methodology is proposed by incorporating urban flood inundation model, improved entropy weight method and k-means cluster algorithm to evaluate urban flood risk. The proposed approach is data driven without considering classification standard of different risk levels, and thus provides a more reasonable and objective result. A region in Haikou, China is adopted to test the applicability of the proposed approach. Seven evaluation indices are selected by coupling the natural hazard index system and hydrological models. The index weights are calculated by an improved entropy weight method that integrates the entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Subsequently, the k-means cluster algorithm is used to develop the flood risk map in the study area. The results indicate that high risk zones cover 13.7% of total area, which generally exhibit higher inundation depth and lower elevations. The assessment result matches well with the historical data of flood events. The traditional cluster algorithm and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods are used for comparison with the improved entropy-cluster algorithm so as to validate the proposed approach for risk management. The result demonstrates that the proposed approach is feasible and exhibits the most reasonable classification result. The study outcomes provide a novel approach for flood risk assessment and can provide valuable information for urban flood management.

AB Regional Climate Models (RCMs) generate past and future climate simulations that serve as input for subsequent modelling of impact projections. The most recent coordinated regional climate modelling initiative, CORDEX, provides RCM data for Europe with increased spatial resolution (12.5 km for the CORDEX EUR-11 ensemble) and based on the new Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCM data from the previous initiative ENSEMBLES had a spatial resolution of 25 km and was based on the SRES emission scenarios. In this contribution we explore the development from ENSEMBLES to CORDEX in a hydrological impact study for the Upper Danube, focussing on the representation of past climate and projections of the future for climate and resulting river discharge. We replicated a hydrological modelling framework, including RCM downscaling and bias correction, that used data of 21 ENSEMBLES RCMs under SRES A1B emission scenario (Kling et al., 2012), and now applied CORDEX EUR-11 data of 32 RCM simulations under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Results with CORDEX show a small improvement in the representation of historical precipitation, but a decline in the accuracy of historical temperature simulations, despite the increase in spatial model resolution. The tendency of ENSEMBLES climate projections is reproduced with the CORDEX RCMs, albeit with slightly higher precipitation in the CORDEX data, yielding a less pronounced reduction in future mean annual discharge for the Upper Danube at Vienna. The previously identified change in discharge seasonality increasing winter discharge and decreasing summer discharge is confirmed with the new CORDEX data. Updating climate impact simulations in the presented rigorous replication framework allows analysing specific new information in the latest generation climate model data as well as crystallizing essential expectable patterns of change that need to be addressed in adaptation strategies.

AB To improve microbial water quality and to prevent waterborne disease outbreaks, knowledge on the fate and transport of contaminants and on the contributions from different faecal sources to the total contamination is essential. The fate and transport of faecal indicators E. coli and enterococci within the Betna River in Bangladesh were simulated using a coupled hydrodynamic and water quality model. The hydrodynamic model for the river was set up, calibrated and validated with water level and discharge in our earlier study. In this study, the hydrodynamic model was further validated using measured water temperature and salinity and coupled with the water quality module. Bacterial load data from various faecal sources were collected and used as input in the water quality model. The model output corresponded very well with the measured E. coli and enterococci concentrations in the river; the Root Mean Square Error and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency for Logio-transformed concentrations were found to be 0.23 (Log(10) CFU/100 ml) and 0.84 for E. cob, and 0.19 (Log(10) CFU/100 ml) and 0.86 for enterococci, respectively. Then, the sensitivity of the model was tested by removing one process or forcing at a time. These simulations revealed that the microbial decay, the upstream concentrations and the discharge of untreated wastewater were the primary factors controlling the concentrations in the river, while wind and the contribution from the diffuse sources (i.e. urban and agricultural runoff) were unlikely to have a major influence. Finally, the model was applied to investigate the influence of wastewater treatment on the bacteria concentrations. This revealed that wastewater treatment would result in a considerable improvement of the microbial water quality of the Betna River. This paper demonstrates the application of a comprehensive state-of-art model in a river in a data-poor tropical area. The model can potentially be applied to other watersheds and can help in formulating solutions to improve the microbial water quality.

AB Water security assessment based on the concept of blue versus green water is becoming widely accepted globally. Blue water is the combination of surface runoff and deep aquifer recharge while green water is the summation of evapotranspiration and soil water content (i.e. mediated by plants). Due to the tight coupling between land use and the partitioning of blue and green water within a watershed, an integrated geospatial modeling framework that links land use and watershed hydrological processes is needed to predict the consequences of future land use change on blue versus green water security. By loosely coupling an agent based probabilistic land use change model with a hydrologic model, we investigated the consequences of present trends of urban growth to identify potential future hotspots of hydrological change across a watershed in central New Jersey undergoing sub urbanization. The agent based probabilistic model, working at the scale of land ownership parcels, predicted that future urban development would be the result of forest, rather than farm land conversion. Using existing zoning maps, the housing unit density and human population of the urban growth areas was estimated. A consequence of the loss of forest land and increasing impervious surface leading was higher blue water but lower green water. While no severe blue water scarcity was observed, an increasing green water scarcity was found in some study area sub-basins. Such information will aid watershed managers' and policymakers' effort in sustainably managing water resources under changing land use and climate.

AB Karst landforms account for 10% of the Earths land surface, and it is well-known that water is a limiting factor for karst ecosystems because numerous underground fractures and conduits induce rapid drainage. Therefore, an understanding of ecosystem water consumptions (evapotranspiration) and environmental controls is particularly important for land management on karst landforms. This study compared the actual evapotranspiration (AET) characteristics and analyzed the controls of three agroforestry ecosystems by field observations using a refitted ventilated-chamber, thermal dissipation probes and micro-lysimeters in a subtropical humid karst catchment from 12th March 2015 to 26th May 2016. Results show that: 1) the diurnal transpiration curves of trees plateau at noon with low fluctuations at a high level, while evapotranspiration curves of grass and crop ecosystems present single peaks; 2) AET of the forest-grass mixed ecosystem (7.64 +/- 5.75 mnrday(-1)) was significantly higher than crop (4.24 +/- 3.35 mm.day(-1)) and grass ecosystems (5.78 +/- 3.53 mm.day(-1)); 3) AET of grass and crop ecosystems were most sensitive to temperature, while the forest-grass mixed ecosystem was more sensitive to leaf area index (LAI) than other factors; 4) AET of the forest-grass mixed ecosystem was more sensitive to deep soil moisture (>30 cm), while grass and crop ecosystems were more sensitive to shallow soil moisture (10 cm and 20 cm). This study suggests that soil water content was not key limit factors to AET in humid karst landscapes. However, LAI, which can be controlled by land management, heavily influenced AET rates and E/AET (E, evaporation) ratio through changing water demand.

   ACCURACY
AB A rivers' longitudinal gradient (i.e. slope) is a key parameter in fluvial hydrology, hydraulics, and geomorphology. It affects a multitude of fluvial variables such as flow velocity and sediment transport. Limitations in river slope data, both its availability and accuracy, constrain the fidelity of fluvial modeling, particularly at larger or global scales. Traditional slope calculation algorithms cannot accurately predict river slopes as these are based on cell-by-cell calculation, which is only suitable for hillslopes and small mountainous streams. This paper presents a methodology for calculating global river slope and a procedure to upscale it for relatively coarse resolution, suitable for global scale modeling. The methodology is based on a simple principle of calculating slope from elevation depression over the length of a river segment, which is automated to allow global scale calculations. Version 1.0 of the Global River-Slope (GloRS) geospatial dataset is introduced and shown to be a step improvement over a previous product (NHDplus for the contiguous United States) and compares favorably to observed slope data collected from the literature. Statistical analysis of Earth's continents and large basins highlights interesting spatial trends. A semi-empirical regression analysis between basin-average river slope and other basin-scale parameters show that terrain slope accounts for 67% of the variability in basin-average river slope, with average discharge, sediment load and basin temperature contributing additional improvements to global predictions of 3%, 4%, and 3%, respectively.

AB When restoring dryland ecosystems, growing biological soil crust (biocrust) may greatly change the redistribution of rainfall in layered soils. However, ecohydrological modelling studies generally ignore biocrust and thus, the ecohydrological effects of biocrust on restorations remain largely unexplored. Using a long-term restoration case (located in the southeast edge of the Tengger Desert, northern China), we developed an ecohydrological model with explicit consideration of the infiltration in three layered soils (biocrust, shallow and deep sand layers) to investigate influences of biocrust on restoration dynamics in drylands. The proportion of infiltration that reaches 'annual grass' (including biocrust and shallow sand layers, 0-30 cm) and 'shrub' layers (30-150 cm) with biocrust significantly increased and decreased relative to the values without biocrust, respectively. Meanwhile, biocrust significantly decreased soil water content in deep sand layer, but not in shallow sand layer. As more water was used by transpiration than evaporation, the ecosystem with biocrust reached a final grass-dominated state (high grass cover of 40%, low shrub cover of 4%) rather than a shrub-dominated state (grass cover of 3%, shrub cover of 20%). This study suggests that we need to account for the roles of biocrust on rainfall infiltration to better understand vegetation and restoration dynamics in dryland ecosystems.

AB Resilience is essential to the integrity of socio-hydrologic systems, especially when faced with stress caused by natural hazards and economic development. Nepal has seen both in recent years. The objective of this study is to construct and implement an indicator-based approach to assess socio-hydrological systems with new metrics to evaluate the influence of hydropower development. We adopted a conceptual framework in which resilience is a relative complement of vulnerability and dependent on adaptive capacity. The framework has eight vulnerability parameters: water variation, water scarcity, water exploitation, water pollution, natural capacity, physical capacity, human resource capacity, and economic capacity. Hydropower development was incorporated into a modified resilience framework to explore the socio-hydrological impacts. This holistic approach revealed that although hydropower development contributes to water stress, it can also increase adaptive capacity. In addition, this study strengthened the argument for indicator-based approaches to evaluating socio-hydrologic systems, particularly when evaluating hydropower development, which impacts numerous economic and hydrologic systems. This type of framework is particularly needed in developing countries, such as Nepal, where water resource development is rapidly increasing and changing traditional socio-hydrologic systems.

AB Communities in regions with seasonal rainfall face annual dry seasons, during which water shortages and conflicts between different water use sectors may erupt. These difficulties increase following wet seasons with low rainfall, such as in relation to El Nino events in the wet-dry tropics of Central America. Hydrologic data are typically scarce in this region, making the development of drought adaptation strategies challenging. Many communities in the region depend on groundwater as their primary water source. For instance in the Province of Guanacaste in Costa Rica, groundwater supplied 78% of the total domestic water demand in 2015 and groundwater recharge from the wet season provides the primary water supply for the subsequent dry season. In this research we present a 'groundwater recharge indicator' that can support water managers in preparing for seasonal droughts. We developed this tool for an aquifer in northwestern Costa Rica where we conducted hydrological monitoring of streams and groundwater levels for 2.5 years, obtained further hydrological data (groundwater levels from 2005 to 2016), and worked with communities to assemble water use data. We combined these datasets in a hydrologic model (the Water Evaluation And Planning system, WEAP) and modelled groundwater recharge from 2005 to 2016, permitting a characterization of the relationship between rainfall and groundwater recharge. The groundwater recharge indicator is based on this relationship, and allows estimating total groundwater recharge for a wet season from cumulative rainfall measured to date. The indicator permits water managers to assess if the current year will likely fall into a low recharge category prior to the end of the wet season. This information can then be used to trigger short-term adaptation strategies with the goal to 'bank' groundwater while surface water sources are still available in the wet season. This indicator-based tool was refined through feedback provided in local stakeholder workshops. We also assessed the overall accuracy of predicting end-of-wet-season groundwater recharge with cumulative rainfall to date, and found that after the first 2-3 months of the wet season, prediction accuracies are high, leaving 5-6 months of wet season to respond adaptively to the prediction. The indicator can help water managers to plan ahead, and communicate the need for water conservation (demand management) and consideration of other water sources such as rain and surface water (supply management). This idea is transferable to other communities in regions with seasonal rainfall, and can support decision makers in increasing the socio-hydrological resilience of communities to seasonal droughts.

AB In the 1890s, hyperimmune sera proved effective in animals against challenge by the snake venom against which they had been raised. They were first used, apparently successfully, in a human patient in about 1895. Since then, antivenoms have become accepted as the only reliable specific treatment for snake-bite envenoming. Despite decades of accumulated clinical experience and a number of published randomized comparative and observational studies, the clinical effectiveness and safety of some antivenoms remain open to question, due to a lack of robust randomized controlled trial data.
   Antivenoms in some poorly regulated markets may have high rates of potentially fatal adverse effects and their use must be balanced by demonstrable effectiveness. Even those manufactured to strict regulatory requirements may pose a rare risk of severe adverse reactions.
   Most antivenoms currently marketed around the world were registered without first being studied clinically. There is increasing pressure to subject antivenoms, even those that are long-established, to the same protocols of rigorous pre-clinical and clinical assessment that are standard regulatory requirements for other drugs. Conventional clinical testing progresses through Phases I, II, III to IV. Most authorities consider antivenoms too dangerous to be used in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. An alternative method for preliminary estimation of safety, dose-finding and effectiveness, is proposed- the "3 + 3" dose escalation or de-escalation design, in volunteer patients, as used in oncology to test cytotoxic drugs.
   Antivenoms are so widely used and well trusted, that there are few ethical justifications for placebo controls. However, placebo might be ethically justified if there were no proven effective treatment and or if withholding or delaying treatment posed acceptably negligible risks to the participants.
   Antivenom trials are most urgently needed in low-to middle-income countries where there are many practical, logistical and funding challenges. Basic requirements for clinical trials include identification of the biting species of snake in every case; the use of objective, clinically-relevant endpoints, such as restoration of blood coagulability; definition of inclusion, exclusion and withdrawal criteria; assurance of antivenom safety; ethical considerations; inclusion of one or more control (comparator) groups; and analysis based on intention to treat. The highest quality evidence comes from Phase II and larger Phase III studies that have been designed as statistically powerful, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), ideally with blinding of patients and investigators to avoid bias. Because of the challenges to carrying out clinical trials of antivenoms, Phase IV trials (post-marketing surveillance) are potentially more important and useful than for most other drugs.

AB The consequences of scorpion stings on the affected victims, including humans, have been known since ancient times. The effects of the venom, first on neurotransmission and thereafter on many physiological processes at the organism, tissue, cellular or molecular levels, have been the subject of intense research. It is, therefore, not surprising that a large number of toxins acting on a variety of ion channels have been isolated and described to date. Many of these toxins show high specificities and affinities towards their natural targets. Along with their own biochemical and biophysical characterization, scorpion toxins have been used as invaluable tools for studies regarding the structure and function of ion channels. They have also become important leads in drug development aiming at diagnosing, targeting or direct treatment of channelopathies caused by the improper function of those channels they recognize, as well as other anomalous physiological conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cancer. The main families of scorpion toxins are reviewed here, among which are those specific for Na+, K+ and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The focus is placed on the historical events that led to their discovery and their use in the identification and characterization of the structure and function of ion channels. Their potential use in medicine is also presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the first report of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins from the South Caucasus region, in particular from Lake Yerevan (Armenia). Microcystis, Dolichospermum and Planktothrix were the key genera identified during the growing season. A trend of a remarkable increase in cyanobacterial densities was observed from 2012 to 2013 exhibiting bloom formation in June (by Nostoc linckia) with the highest values in June and August 2013, reaching up to 695.9*10(3) cells mL(-1) Seasonal dependence of cyanobacterial density on temperature, and temperature as a driver for cyanobacterial cells growth and development were suggested. Biogenic nutrients were identified as co-drivers determining species richness and dominance, as well as the distribution of phytoplankton in different parts of the reservoir.
   Cyanotoxin concentrations in the filtered biomass were reported during July 2012 for both stations of the reservoir (left and right bank). Microcystin-RR (MC-RR) was the most abundant and the most frequently observed cyanotoxin. Lower MC-LR concentrations were identified in all samples from both stations, with the highest values observed at the right bank in July 2012. [D-Asp(3)]MC-RR, MC-YR, MCHtyR, [D-Asp(3)]MC-LR, MC-HilR, MC-WR, MC-LY and MC-LW were also identified in trace levels. Anatoxin-a (ANA) was reported in the samples from both stations during August 2012. Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) was present in trace concentrations in samples from both stations during July and in the sample from the left bank during September. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Currently, biological and organic substances are screened in order to find a new generation of therapeutics active against cancer. Previous research has identified promising candidate peptides in snake venom. In this study, venoms from different snake species (Naja annulifera, Naja kaouthia, Ophiophagus hannah and Echis carinatus) were screened for potential anti-cancer properties using pancreatic tumour cells as the assay system. The cells were incubated with venom and then subjected to the following analyses: (i) in vitro cell death (ii) in vitro migration (iii) in vivo dissemination and (iv) in vivo angiogenesis. For the in vivo assays, the cells, after incubation and labelling, were transplanted into the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos for motility and angiogenesis. The results showed strong effects in cells treated with venoms from Ophiophagus hannah and Echis carinatus in the in vitro assays. In the in vivo assays, venom derived from Ophiophagus hannah had the most potent effects with respect to angiogenesis. These venoms might therefore be considered as candidates for further studies.

AB Sea anemone venom is rich in bioactive compounds, including peptides containing multiple disulfide bridges. In a transcriptomic study on Oulactis sp., we identified the putative 36-residue peptide, OspTx2b, which is an isoform of the K-v channel blocker OspTx2a (Sunanda Petal. [2018] Identification, chemical synthesis, structure and function of a new K(v)1 channel blocking peptide from Oulactis sp. Peptide Science, in press). As OspTx2b contains a ShK/BgK-like cysteine framework, with high amino acid sequence similarity to BgK, we were interested to investigate its structure and function. The solution structure of OspTx2b was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. OspTx2b does indeed possess a BgK-like scaffold, with the same disulfide bond connectivities. The orientation of the Lys-Tyr dyad in OspTx2b is more similar to that in ShK than in BgK. However, it failed to show against a range of voltage-gated potassium channels in Xenopus oocytes and human T lymphocytes. OspTx2b also showed no growth inhibitory activity against several strains of bacteria and fungi. Having a BgK-like fold with the Lys-Tyr dyad but no BgK-like activity highlights the importance of key amino acid residues in BgK that are missing in OspTx2b. The lack of activity against the Kv channels assessed in this study emphasises that the ShK/BgK scaffold is capable of supporting functional activity beyond potassium channel blockade.

AB During current research, the effects of deoxynivalenol (DON) exposure on cerebral lipid peroxidation, neurotransmitter secretion and calcium homeostasis in chicks were evaluated. One hundred and twenty Hailan chicks (male, 1-day-old) were randomly divided into four groups. Chicks in low, medium and high dose groups were fed with 0.27, 1.68 and 12.21 mg/kg(-1) DON respectively by gavage according to feed intake. Chicks in control group were fed with physiological saline by gavage. The trials were conducted for 36 d. At the end of the trials, twenty chicks per group were sacrificed, and the cerebra were collected for measuring the brain indices. Compared with the control group, the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase were significantly decreased in treatment groups (P < 0.05), the contents of malondialdehyde in high dose group were increased (P < 0.05), the catalase activities and nitric oxide contents in medium and high dose groups were decreased (P < 0.05), and the activities of T-AOC in high dose group were reduced (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the concentrations of norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in high dose group were obviously increased (P < 0.05), while the concentrations of dopamine were decreased (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the concentrations of calcium and calmodulin (CaM) in medium and high dose groups were lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05), and the gene relative expression of CaM mRNA in treatment groups were significantly reduced (P < 0.05), in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that DON exposure can affect the cerebral lipid peroxidation, neurotransmitters secretion and the balance of calcium homeostasis in chicks.

AB Benthic cyanobacteria recognized as producers of natural products, including cyanotoxins, have been neglected for systematic toxicological studies. Thus, we have performed a broad study investigating cyanotoxin potential of 311 non-planktic nostocacean representatives combining molecular and chemical analyses. Out of these, a single strain Nostoc sp. Treb K1/5, was identified as a new microcystin producer. Microcystins [Asp(3)]MC-YR, [Asp(3)] MC-FR, [Asp(3)]MC-HtyR and Ala-Leu/Ile-Asp-Arg-Adda-Glu-Mdha are reported for the first time from the genus Nostoc. All the studied strains were also analyzed for the occurrence of nodularins, cylindrospermopsin and (homo)anatoxin-a, yet no novel producer has been discovered. Our findings indicate rare occurrence of the common cyanotoxins in non-planktic nostocaceae which is in contrast with frequent reports of cyanotoxin producers among phylogenetically closely related planktic cyanobacteria.

AB Arthropod venoms may be considered important sources of bioactive molecules; however, technical difficulties, such as venom extraction and homogeneity may impair the biochemical identification of new molecules. In this context, we have developed a method to maintain wasps in captivity that allows the collection of the venom, without use of chemical, mechanical or electrical stimuli. The crude venom was analyzed by RP-HPLC-ESIQ-ToF and 20 peptides were identified by de novo peptide sequencing, among them Eumenine-Mastoparan and a Ponericin-G2-simile peptide.

We cover the progress of serum therapy since tetanus and diphtheria antitoxins in Germany and France until the current scenario of antivenom production worldwide. During these more than 120 years of antivenom development, many researchers contributed to establish what are nowadays the antivenoms used for therapeutic purpose. The history of antivenoms development is fascinating! This review aims to recognize all those who contributed to the establishment of new sera, new methodologies and saving lives: much more than Calmette and Vital Brazil.

AB Transcriptomic profiling of venom producing tissues from different animals is an effective approach for discovering new toxins useful in biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications, as well in evolutionary comparative studies of venomous animals. Stichodactyla helianthus is a Caribbean sea anemone which produces actinoporins as part of its toxic venom. This family of pore forming toxins is multigenic and at least two different isoforms, encoded by separate genes, are produced by S. helianthus. These isoforms, sticholysins I and II, share 93% amino acid identity but differ in their pore forming activity and act synergistically. This observation suggests that other actinoporin isoforms, if present in the venomous mixture, could offer an advantageous strategy to modulate whole venom activity. Using high-throughput sequencing we generated a de novo transcriptome of S. helianthus and determined the relative expression of assembled transcripts using RNA-Seq to better characterize components of this species' venom, focusing on actinoporin diversity. Applying this approach, we have discovered at least one new actinoporin variant from S. helianthus in addition to several other putative venom components.

AB The scourge of snakebite has been well documented but largely ignored by the global health community for several decades, especially the role that economics has played in causing and exacerbating this crisis. Every year millions of people in low and middle-income countries face death, disability and disadvantage from snakebite envenoming (SBE) without access to appropriate treatment. Health-economic factors pervade every aspect of this neglected problem. A multitude of financial and commercial factors helped to cause, and now perpetuate, shortages of high quality, affordable and region-appropriate antivenom in areas where they are most needed. Alongside the death, physical disability and psychological anguish from SBE is a debilitating financial toll, which includes both direct costs of treatment and indirect costs from lost income. SBE is a problem that disproportionately affects poor, rural and agrarian communities, with most victims being young and industrious subsistence workers. The burden of envenoming is often felt by families and communities that can least afford it, and negatively impacts local and national productivity. The lack of long-term investment in health systems to properly manage SBE has led to insufficient funding for antivenom development, procurement, quality control and distribution, despite highly favourable cost effectiveness of some antivenoms. This has contributed to market failures that have seen antivenom output fall and become inaccessible to most victims. Solutions to these problems exist and are achievable, however the challenge for advocates is to appreciate the importance of health economics and ensure that strategies to redress the economic causes and consequences of SBE are themselves cost-effective and financially sustainable.

AB A rapid screening of the most toxic aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) in medicinal materials of radix and rhizome was performed by an immune chromatography method for the first time. The colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip was prepared after optimization of the conjugation of gold particles with monoclonal antibody, the test line and the control line. Under optimized conditions, the detection limit of the constructed test strip was as low as 0.1 ng mL(-1) and the total analysis was conducted within 15 min by naked eyes. Four kinds of medicinal materials (Gastrodia elata, Poria cocos, Bletilla striata and Radix Angelicae Dahuricae) were investigated by the strip. Various complex matrixes pay a significant influence on the feasibility and effectiveness of the strip screening in medicinal materials. Aiming to the characteristics of selected medicinal materials, the screening was successfully proceeded with extraction by 70% methanol-water as well as three-fold dilution in Gastrodia elata and Radix Angelicae Dahuricae, 70% methanol-PBS as well as four-fold dilution in Poria cocos., and 60% methanol-water as well as four-fold dilution in Bletilla striata. Among the collected 40 samples, one was found to be positive of AFB(1) with level above 5 mu g kg(-1). The result was in a good agreement with those obtained from LC-MS/MS determination (6.12 mu g kg(-1)). The gold immunochromatographic strip was demonstrated as a rapid, cost-effective, reliable and on-site screening technique for mycotoxins in starch and polysaccharides-rich herbal medicines.

AB Freshwater stingray accidents cause an immediate, intense, and unrelieved pain which is followed by edema, erythema and necrosis formation. Treatment for stingray envenomation is based on administration of analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drugs. Concerning pain control, it is prescribed to immerse punctured limb on hot water to alleviate pain. There are no studies demonstrating specific targets on which stingray venom acts to promote pain. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate some mechanisms of Potamotrygon motoro venom (PmV) that contribute to nociception induction. Evaluating spontaneous pain behavior in mice injected i.pl. with PmV, it was seen that PmV induced both neurogenic and inflammatory pain. PmV also induced hyperalgesia in both mice and rats, evaluated through electronic von Frey and rat paw pressure test, respectively. Partial inhibition of hyperalgesia was observed in mice treated with cromolyn or promethazine, which indicated that mast cell and histamine via H1 receptor participate in the inflammatory pain. To search for some targets involved in PmVinduced hyperalgesia, the participation of TRPV1, calcium channels, neurokinins, CGRP, and norepinephrine, was evaluated in rats. It was seen that PmV-induced hyperalgesia occurs with the participation of neurokinins, mainly via NK1 receptor, CGRP, and calcium influx, through both P/Q and L-type voltage dependent calcium channels, besides TRPV1 activation. The data presented herein indicate that PmV causes hyperalgesia in rodents which is dependent on the participation of several neuroinflammatory mediators.

AB For the first time, alcohol extracts of Atelopus hoogmoedi from the Guiana Shield in Suriname and Guyana were analyzed for the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and of its analogues by high resolution hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. One specimen from Suriname was found to contain TTX and 4-epiTTX. Using a monoclonal antibody-based immunohistochemical staining technique, TTX was localized mainly in the granular glands and epithelium of the skin, but not in internal organs except liver showing weak TTX-positive reaction. In two specimens collected in Guyana, none of the toxins were detected.

AB This report describes a series of ten cases of fulminant pulmonary haemorrhage in dogs following envenomation by the eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis) in south eastern Queensland, Australia. All cases were presented for veterinary treatment during 2011-2018 at a specialist veterinary emergency centre. Each case received prompt antivenom treatment and supportive care. Pulmonary haemorrhage was diagnosed based on clinical examination; overt haemoptysis; thoracic radiographic demonstration of a diffuse alveolar pattern; and, the presence of venom induced consumptive coagulopathy. The median elapsed time from hospital admission to onset of haemoptysis was 2 h (range 0-18 h). In 80% (8/10) of cases endotracheal intubation was required, whilst 20% (2/10) were successfully treated with mask oxygen supplementation alone, and 40% (4/10) received mechanical ventilation; but only 25% (1/4) of these survived to hospital discharge. Fresh frozen canine plasma was administered to 70% (7/10) of cases and 43% (3/7) of these survived. Of the total number of cases presented for treatment, 30% (3/10) survived to hospital discharge, 60% (6/10) were euthanised due to poor prognosis and 10% (1/10) died from cardiac arrest. Initial serum brown snake venom antigen levels were retrospectively measured from frozen serum samples by venom specific sandwich ELISA in two dogs at 154 ng/mL (survived) and 3607 ng/mL (euthanised); no free venom was detected post-antivenom. Dogs that survived were discharged from hospital without apparent complications. Pulmonary haemorrhage is an uncommon event following envenomation by P. textilis in dogs and has not been described in similarly envenomed humans. This case series highlights the potential for fulminant and fatal pulmonary haemorrhage in dogs following eastern brown snake envenomation.

AB A 67-year-old Caucasian male with lung cancer was presented to the Emergency Department with asthenia, anorexia, jaundice and choluria. The patient's lung cancer was being treated medically by a combination of paclitaxel/carboplatin with bi-monthly frequency. The patient was also self-medicating with several natural products, including Chlorella (520 mg/day), Silybum marianum (total of 13.5 mg silymarin/day), zinc sulphate (5.5 mg), selenium (50 mu g) and 15 g/day of Curcuma longa. In first chemotherapy cycle no toxicity was observed even he was taking other medications as budesonide and sitagliptin. The toxic events started only after the introduction of the dietary products. Chlorella had contamination with cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) and 1.08 mu g of cyanotoxin Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) per gram of biomass was found. Patient was consuming ca 0.01 mu g MC-LR/kg/day. This case report describes the first known case of paclitaxel toxicity probably related to pharmacokinetic interaction with Turmeric and a contaminated Chlorella supplement resulting in an acute toxic hepatitis and the impact on oncologic patient health.

AB Micrurus venoms are known to induce mainly neurotoxicity in victims. However, other manifestations, including hemorrhage, edema, myotoxicity, complement activation, and hemostatic activity have been reported. In order to develop a more complete pharmacological profile of these venoms, inflammatory responses and hemostasis were evaluated in C57BL/6 mice treated with a sub-lethal dose of M. t tener (Mtt) venom (8 mu g/mouse), inoculated intraperitoneally. The venom induced moderate bleeding into the abdominal cavity and lungs, as well as infiltration of leukocytes into the liver. After 30 min, the release of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and NO) were observed, being most evident at 4 h. There was a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels at 72 h, a prolongation in coagulation times (PT and aPTT), a decrease in the fibrinogen concentration and an increase in fibrinolytic activity. In this animal model, it was proposed that Mtt venom induces inflammation with the release of mediators such as TNF-alpha, in response to the toxins. These mediators may activate hemostatic mechanisms, producing systemic fibrinolysis and hemorrhage. These findings suggest alternative treatments in Micrurus envenomations in which neurotoxic manifestations do not predominate.

AB Proteins that account for the hemolytic activity found in scorpaeniform fish venoms are responsible for the majority of the effects observed upon envenomation, for instance, neurotoxic, cardiotoxic and inflammatory effects. These multifunctional toxins, described as protein lethal factors and referred to as cytolysins, are known to be extremely labile molecules. In the present work, we endeavored to overcome this constraint by determining optimal storage conditions for Sp-CTx, the major bioactive component from the scorpionfish Scorpaena plumieri venom. This cardiotoxic hemolytic cytolysin is a large dimeric glycoprotein (subunits of approximate to 65 kDa) with pore forming ability. We were able to establish storage conditions that allowed us to keep the toxin partially active for up to 60 days. Stability was achieved by storing Sp-CTx at -80 and -196 degrees C in the presence of glycerol 10% in a pH 7.4 solution. It was demonstrated that the hemolytic activity of Sp-CTx is calcium dependent, being abolished by EDTA and zinc ions. Furthermore, the toxin exhibited its maximal hemolytic activity at pH between 8 and 9, displaying typical N- and O- linked glycoconjugated residues (galactose (1-4) N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid (2-3) galactose in N- and/or O-glycan complexes). The hemolytic activity of Sp-CTx was inhibited by phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine, suggesting a direct electrostatic interaction lipid - toxin in the pore-formation mechanism of action of this toxin. In addition, we observed that the hemolytic activity was inhibited by increasing doses of cholesterol. Finally, we were able to show, for first time, that Sp-CTx is at least partially responsible for the pain and inflammation observed upon envenomation. However, while the edema induced by Sp-CTx was reduced by pre-treatment with aprotinin and HOE-140, pointing to the involvement of the kallikrein-kinin system in this response, these drugs had no significant effect in the toxin-induced nociception. Taken together, our results could suggest that, as has been already reported for other fish cytolysins, Sp-CTx acts mostly through lipid-dependent pore formation not only in erythrocytes but also in other cell types, which could account for the pain observed upon envenomation. We believe that the present work paves the way towards the complete characterization of fish cytolysins.

AB Lathyrism is a disease caused by excessive consumption of grass pea, Lathyrus sativus especially under conditions of severe drought. Grass pea contains 3-N-oxalyl-L-2, 3-diaminopropanoic acid (beta-ODAP) a putative neurotoxin which acts through excitatory mechanism causing Neurolathyrism. Due to awareness of the disease, availability of food and levels of consumption of L sativus there is reduction in lathyrism cases where higher consumption of L sativus is reported in India. The present study was undertaken with the objective to assess the current scenario of consumption of L. sativus, incidence of cases of lathyrism, beta-ODAP, protein and amino acids content in L. sativus pulse collected from three districts (Bilaspur, Durg and Raipur) of Chattisgarh state. For this purpose, a total of 17,755 (13,129 rural and 4626 urban) individuals from 151 villages and 60 wards from urban area were covered for clinical examination. Out of total 5769 households (HHs) covered during the survey, 1602 HHs were cultivators, 1791 HHs non-cultivators and 2376 agricultural and other labourers. A one day 24-hour re-call diet survey was carried out in 5758 HHs (4549 rural and 1209 urban). A total of 360 split grass pea (SGP) samples were collected to estimate beta-ODAP, protein and amino acids content. Results of the study revealed that an average consumption of SGP was 20.9 gm/CU/day in Bilaspur and no consumption was reported among urban population of Raipur. Only nine old cases of lathyrism were found during the study. The mean beta-ODAP content in SGP was 0.63 +/- 0.14, 0.65 +/- 0.13 and 0.65 0.14 gm/100 gm, whereas the protein content was 27.0 +/- 2.39, 27.0 +/- 1.99 and 26.7 +/- 1.90 gm/100 gm in samples collected from Bilaspur, Durg and Raipur districts respectively. Arginine content was high in SGP and sulphur containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine) were less than other amino acids. In conclusion, the consumption of SGP was lower in these three districts with lower beta-ODAP content than earlier reports, thus the lower prevalence of lathyrism in the districts surveyed.

AB Preparations of palytoxin (PLTX, derived from Japanese Palythoa tuberculosa) and the congeners 42-OH-PLTX (from Hawaiian P. toxica) and ovatoxin-a (isolated from a Japanese strain of Ostreopsis ovata), as well as a 50:50 mixture of PLTX and 42-OH-PLTX derived from Hawaiian P. tuberculosa were characterized as to their concentration, composition, in-vitro potency and interaction with an anti-PLTX monoclonal antibody (mAb), after which they were evaluated for lethality and tissue histopathology after intraperitoneal (IP) and aerosol administration to rats. Once each preparation was characterized as to its toxin composition by LC-HAMS and normalized to a total PLTX/OVTX concentration using HPLC-UV, all four preparations showed similar potency towards mouse erythrocytes in the erythrocyte hemolysis assay and interactions with the anti-PLTX mAb. The IP LD50 values derived from these experiments (0.92, 1.93, 1.81 and 3.26 mu g/kg, for the 50:50 mix, 42-OH-PLTX, PLTX, and ovatoxin-a, respectively) were consistent with published values, although some differences from the published literature were seen. The aerosol LD50 values (0.063, 0.045, 0.041, and 0.031 mu g/kg for the 50:50 mix, 42-OH PLTX, PLTX, and ovatoxin-a, respectively) confirmed the exquisite potency of PLTX suggested by the literature. The tissue histopathology of the different toxin preparations by IP and aerosol administration were similar, albeit with some differences. Most commonly affected tissues were the lungs, liver, heart, salivary glands, and adrenal glands. Despite some differences, these results suggest commonalities in potency and mechanism of action among these PLTX congeners.

AB Snakes belonging to the genus Naja (Elapid family), also known as "spitting cobras", can spit venom towards the eyes of the predator as a defensive strategy, causing painful and potentially blinding ocular envenoming. Venom ophthalmia is characterized by pain, hyperemia, blepharitis, blepharospasm and corneal erosions. Elapid venom ophthalmia is not well documented and no specific treatment exists. Furthermore, accidental ejection of venom by non-spitting vipers, as Bothrops, also occurs. The Ex vivo Eye Irritation Test model (EVEIT) has enabled important progress in the knowledge of chemical ocular burns. Considering the lack of experimental animal model, we adapted the EVEIT to study venom ophthalmia mechanisms. Ex vivo rabbit corneas were exposed to venoms from spitting (Naja mossambica, Naja nigricollis) and non-spitting (Naja naja, Bothrops jararaca and Bothrops lanceolatus) snakes, and rinsed or not with water. The corneal thickness and the depth of damage were assessed using high-resolution optical coherence tomography (HR-OCT) imaging and histological analysis. All Naja venoms induced significant corneal edema, collagen structure disorganization and epithelial necrosis. Corneas envenomed by African N. mossambica and N. nigricollis venoms were completely opaque. Opacification was not observed in corneas treated with venoms from non-spitting snakes, such as the Asian cobra, N. naja, and the vipers, B. jararaca and B. lanceolatus. Moreover, Bothrops venoms were able to damage the epithelium and cause collagen structure disorganization, but not edema. Immediate water rinsing improved corneal status, though damage and edema could still be observed. In conclusion, the present study shows that the EVEIT model was successfully adapted to set a new experimental ex vivo animal model of ophthalmia, caused by snake venoms, which will enable to explore new therapies for venom ophthalmia.

AB Toads of the genus Melanophryniscus contain toxic alkaloids sequestered from a diet of mainly ants and mites. Wild-caught specimens of M. klappenbachi were fed an alkaloid-free diet and their alkaloid profile was analyzed during 38 months in captivity. Individual alkaloid patterns varied considerably. Over time, the concentration of two alkaloids, pumiliotoxin 251D and 3,5-disubstituted indolizidine 195B, significantly declined, suggesting that the toads depend on continuous access to alkaloid-containing prey to maintain natural levels of their chemical defense.

AB A homodimeric L-amino acid oxidase enzyme (Cv-LAAOI) was isolated from the venom of Cerastes vipera (Egyptian Sand viper) using gel filtration followed by anion exchange chromatography. The molecular mass of Cv-LAAO is 120 kDa in its native form and 60 kDa in its monomeric form. The optimum enzyme activity was achieved on L-Leucine as a substrate in 50 mM buffer pH 7.5 at 50 degrees C. The Cv-LAAOI activity was significantly reduced by increasing the temperature over 40 degrees C, lost 75% of its activity at 60 degrees C and inhibited completely at 80 degrees C. The Cv-LAAOI attains the highest substrate specificity towards L-Met. The results have also indicated that Mn2+ enhances the enzyme activity by 10%, while Cu2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Co2+ have suppressive effects on the Cv-LAAOI activity. On the other hand, EDTA has no significant effect on the enzyme activity. The kinetic parameters of Cv-LAAOI activity (K-m, K-cac and V-max) estimated on L-Leucine at pH 8 and 37 degrees C were found to be 2 mM, 12 S-1 and 16.7 mu mol/min/ml, respectively. In addition, the results have shown that Cv-LAAOI exhibits a significant bactericidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with MIC values of 20 mu g/ml. Moreover, Cv-LAAOI has exhibited a considerable cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) with IC50 value 2.75 +/- 0.38 mu g/ml compared with different tumor cell lines (liver HepG2, lung A549, colon HCT116 and prostate PC3). Furthermore, Cv-LAAOI has triggered antiproliferative activity via extensive H2O2 generation as indicated by the increase in H2O2 and TBARS levels accompanied by the depletion in the catalase activity (CAT) in MCF-7 treated cells compared to the untreated ones. Thus, these findings clearly indicate that Cv-LAAOI has a selective cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cell line, demonstrating a great prospective for future use in cancer therapy.

AB Envenomation by Bothrops snakes promotes the release of inflammatory mediators, whose effects during this context are not well understood. These mediators include chemokines, cytokines and eicosanoids. Indeed, Bothrops snake envenomation results in local and systemic perturbations, including leukocyte recruitment, edema, pain and extensive tissue damage. Recently, our group demonstrated that leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) regulate macrophage production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) induced by scorpion venom. Whether these molecular mechanisms also affect host cell responses to snake venoms, such as those from B. jararaca or B. jararacussu, is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that B. jararaca or B. jararacussu venoms induce macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1 alpha) and IL-1 beta production by THP-1 (cell line of human peripheral blood monocytes) and AMJ2-C11 (cell line of mouse alveolar macrophage). We also show that venoms from both Bothrops species induce NF-kappa B activation in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, we observed that treatment of THP-1 and AMJ2-C11 cell lines with exogenous PGE(2) reduces MIP-1 alpha production, while increasing IL-1 beta production in cells stimulated by B. jararaca or B. jararacussu venoms. Interestingly, exogenous LTB4 had the opposite effect by reducing IL-1 beta and increasing MIP-1 alpha release. Our results suggest that, differential eicosanoid metabolism in myeloid cells is tightly associated with the production of cytokines and chemokines after stimulation with B. jararaca or B. jararacussu venoms.

AB MCLR has been shown to act as potent hepatotoxin, and recent studies showed that MCs can accumulate in lung tissue and exert adverse effects. However, the exact mechanism still remain unclear. The present study mainly focuses on the impairments of respiratory system after MCLR exposure in mice. After intratracheal instillation with MCLR (0, 10 and 25 mu g/kg bw), histological change was examined in MCLR exposure groups. Results indicated that exposure of MCLR led to serious histopathology alteration and apoptosis in lung of mice. To further our understanding of the toxic effects of MCLR on the lung, we employed a proteomic method to search the mechanisms behind MCLR-induced pulmonary injury. In total, 38 proteins were identified to be significantly altered after MCLR exposure. These proteins involved in inflammatory response, apoptosis, cytoskeleton, and energetic metabolism, suggesting MCLR exerts complex toxic effects contributing to pulmonary injury. Furthermore, MCLR also induced pulmonary inflammation, as manifested by up-regulating the protein levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and p65 subunit. Our results indicated that MCLR exerts lung injury mainly by generating inflammation and apoptosis.

AB During the last 12 years, over 80 countries have introduced national HPV vaccination programs. The majority of these countries are high or upper-middle income countries. The barriers to HPV vaccine introduction remain greatest in those countries with the highest burden of cervical cancer and the most need for vaccination. Innovation and global leadership is required to increase and sustain introductions in low income and lower -middle income countries. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB HPV L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines administered in a prime/boost series of three injections over six months have demonstrated remarkable prophylactic efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in national immunization programs with high rates of coverage. There is mounting evidence that the vaccines have similar efficacy and effectiveness even when administered in a single dose. The unexpected potency of one dose of these VLP vaccines may largely be attributed to structural features of the particles, which lead to the efficient generation of long-lived antigen-specific antibody-producing cells and unique features of the virus life cycle that make the HPV virions highly susceptible to antibody-mediated inhibition of infection.

AB The Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT), a phase III randomized clinical trial, provided the initial data that one dose of the HPV vaccine could provide durable protection against HPV infection. Although the study design was to administer all participants three doses of HPV or control vaccine, 20% of women did not receive the three-dose regimens, mostly due to involuntary reasons unrelated to vaccination. In 2011, we reported that a single dose of the bivalent HPV vaccine could be as efficacious as three doses of the vaccine using the endpoint of persistent HPV infection accumulated over the first four years of the trial; findings independently confirmed in the GSK-sponsored PATRICIA trial. Antibody levels after one dose, although lower than levels elicited by three doses, were 9-times higher than levels elicited by natural infection. Importantly, levels remained essentially constant over at least seven years, suggesting that the observed protection provided by a single dose might be durable. Much work has been done to assure these non-randomized findings are valid. Yet, the group of recipients who received one dose of the bivalent HPV vaccine in the CVT and PATRICIA trials was small and not randomly selected nor blinded to the number of doses received. The next phase of research is to conduct a formal randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the protection afforded by a single dose of HPV vaccine. Complementary studies are in progress to bridge our findings to other populations, and to further document the long-term durability of antibody response following a single dose.

AB Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a major strategy for preventing cervical and other ano-genital cancers. Worldwide HPV vaccination introduction and coverage will be facilitated if a single dose of vaccine is as effective as two or three doses or demonstrates significant protective effect compared to 'no vaccination'.
   Methods: In a multi-centre cluster randomized trial of two vs three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccination (Gardasillm) in India, suspension of the vaccination due to events unrelated to the study led to per protocol and partial vaccination of unmarried 10-18 year old girls leading to four study groups, two by design and two by default. They were followed up for the primary outcomes of immunogenicity in terms of Ll genotype-specific binding antibody titres, neutralising antibody titres, and antibody avidity for the vaccine-targeted HPV types and HPV infections. Analysis was per actual number of vaccine doses received. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 1SRCTN98283094; and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00923702.
   Findings: Of the 17,729 vaccinated girls, 4348 (25%) received three doses on days 1, 60, 180 or later, 4979 (28%) received two doses on days 1 and 180 or later, 3452 (19%) received two doses on days 1 and 60, and 4950 (28%) received one dose. One dose recipients demonstrated a robust and sustained immune response against HPV 16 and 18, albeit inferior to that of 3- or 2-doses and the antibody levels were stable over a 4 year period. The frequencies of cumulative incident and persistent HPV 16 and 18 infections up to 7 years of follow-up were similar and uniformly low in all the vaccinated study groups; the frequency of HPV 16 and 18 infections were significantly higher in unvaccinated age-matched control women than among vaccine recipients. The frequency of vaccine non-targeted HPV types was similar in the vaccinated groups but higher in the unvaccinated control women.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that a single dose of quadrivalent HPV vaccine is immunogenic and provides lasting protection against HPV 16 and 18 infections similar to the three- and two-dose vaccine schedules, although the study suffer from some limitations. Data on long term protection beyond 7 years against HPV infection and cervical precancerous lesions are needed before policy guidelines regarding a single dose can be formulated and implemented. Significant and long-lasting protective effect of a single dose can be a strong argument to introduce one dose of the HPV vaccine in many low income countries where the current standard of care for cervical cancer prevention is 'no intervention'.

AB When administered as standard three-dose schedules, the licensed HPV prophylactic vaccines have demonstrated extraordinary immunogenicity and efficacy. We summarize the immunogenicity of these licensed vaccines and the most commonly used serology assays, with a focus on key considerations for one-dose vaccine schedules.
   Although immune correlates of protection against infection are not entirely clear, both preclinical and clinical evidence point to neutralizing antibodies as the principal mechanism of protection. Thus, immunogenicity assessments in vaccine trials have focused on measurements of antibody responses to the vaccine. Non-inferiority of antibody responses after two doses of HPV vaccines separated by 6 months has been demonstrated and this evidence supported the recent WHO recommendations for two-dose vaccination schedules in both boys and girls 9-14 years of age. There is also some evidence suggesting that one dose of HPV vaccines may provide protection similar to the currently recommended two-dose regimens but robust data on efficacy and immunogenicity of one-dose vaccine schedules are lacking. In addition, immunogenicity has been assessed and reported using different methods, precluding direct comparison of results between different studies and vaccines. New head-to-head vaccine trials evaluating one-dose immunogenicity and efficacy have been initiated and an increase in the number of trials relying on immunobridging is anticipated. Therefore, standardized measurement and reporting of immunogenicity for the up to nine HPV types targeted by the current vaccines is now critical. Building on previous HPV serology assay standardization and harmonization efforts initiated by the WHO HPV LabNet in 2006, new secondary standards, critical reference reagents and testing guidelines will be generated as part of a new partnership to facilitate harmonization of the immunogenicity testing in new HPV vaccine trials.

AB Although human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines were initially licensed based on efficacy after three-dose regimens in women aged 15-26 years, it was recognized early in clinical development that comparable immunogenicity could be obtained after just two doses when administered to younger girls. In both Canada and Mexico, public health authorities made the decision to administer two doses 6 months apart with a planned additional dose at 60 months, while simultaneously doing further study to determine if the third dose would confer meaningful additional benefit. This delayed third dose approach permitted a more cost-effective program with opportunities for improved compliance while minimizing injections and leaving open the opportunity to provide a full three-dose vaccination series. It required close cooperation across many governmental and civil society leadership bodies and real-time access to emerging data on HPV vaccine effectiveness.
   Although still limited, there is increasing evidence that even one-dose vaccination is sufficient to provide prolonged protection against HPV infection and associated diseases. Ongoing clinical trials and ecological studies are expected to consolidate existing data regarding one dose schedule use. However, to accelerate the preventive effect of HPV vaccination some jurisdictions, in particular those with limited resources may already consider the initiation of a one dose vaccination with the possibility of giving the second dose later in life if judged necessary. Such an approach would facilitate vaccination implementation and might permit larger catch-up vaccination programs in older girls (or as appropriate, girls and boys), thereby accelerating the impact on cervical cancer and other HPV-associated diseases.

AB Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines were first licensed as a three-dose series; a two-dose series is now recommended in some age groups and there is interest in possible one-dose vaccination.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of HPV vaccine effectiveness by number of doses, including assessment of biases and impact of varying buffer periods (time between vaccination and outcome counting).
   Results: Of 3787 articles identified, 26 full articles were assessed and 14 included in our review. All studies were conducted within the context of recommended three-dose schedules of bivalent (3) or quadrivalent HPV vaccine (11). Two evaluated effectiveness for prevention of HPV prevalence, six anogenital warts, and six abnormal cervical cytology or histology. Many studies found differences between three-, two- and one-dose vaccine recipients, indicating possible differences in HPV exposure prior to vaccination or in risk behavior. Adjusted or stratified analyses were conducted to control for potential confounding. All studies found significant vaccine effectiveness with three doses, 11 with two doses at various intervals, and six with one dose. Most studies showed a relationship (not always statistically significant) between effectiveness and number of doses, with greater decreases in HPV-related outcomes with three, followed by two and one dose(s). Few studies conducted formal comparisons of three vs fewer doses. Three of four studies that examined buffer periods found higher effectiveness and a smaller difference by number of doses with longer periods.
   Conclusion: Most post-licensure studies report highest effectiveness with three doses; some found no statistically significant difference between two and three doses. Additionally, almost half found some effectiveness with one dose. Several biases impact estimates, with most biasing two- and one-dose results away from showing effectiveness. Future effectiveness studies, examining persons vaccinated prior to sexual activity and using methods to reduce potential sources of bias, can help inform vaccination policy.

AB Background: Women in sub-Saharan Africa have high dual burden of HPV and HIV infections, which can interact to increase cervical cancer (CC) risk. The 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine has high demonstrated effectiveness against HPV types causing 90% of CC. Additionally, one dose of the 9vHPV vaccine has the potential to achieve greater coverage at lower costs than a two-dose schedule. However, the potential impact of single-dose 9vHPV vaccine accounting for HPV-HIV interactions has not been estimated.
   Methods: We adapted a dynamic HIV transmission model to include HPV acquisition and CC pathogenesis and projected the impact of a single dose 9vHPV preadolescent vaccination in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We report health impacts of HPV vaccination separately for HIV-positive women stratified by HIV treatment and CD4 count and HIV-negative women.
   Results: At 90% coverage of females age 9 years with 80% lifelong vaccine efficacy, single dose HPV vaccination was projected to reduce CC incidence by 74% and mortality by 71% in the general female population at 70 years after the start of the vaccination program. Age-standardized CC incidence and mortality reductions were comparable among HIV-negative women, HIV-positive women, and HIV-positive women on ART. Health benefits were reduced when assuming waning protection at 10, 15 and 20 years after vaccination.
   Discussion: Single dose 9vHPV vaccination is projected to avert substantial CC burden in South Africa and similar high HIV prevalence settings. Health benefits were comparable across all female subpopulations stratified by HIV status, CD4 count, and ART status. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Physical activity declines in COPD while exercise capacity remains

DT Article

ID OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; WALK TEST; STANDARDIZATION; STATEMENT;
   MORTALITY; TESTS
AB Background and objective: Daily physical activity (PA) and exercise capacity are reduced in patients with COPD. Whether the natural longitudinal course of both appears synchronically or one precedes the other is currently unclear. The aim was to assess the longitudinal relationship between exercise capacity and physical activity and their changes over time in patients with COPD.
   Methods: In a longitudinal observation-study of heterogeneous COPD patients, recruited from pulmonary outpatient clinics or hospital settings, we annually investigated two exercise capacity tests (1-min sit to stand test (STS) and 6 min walking test (6MWT)) and daily physical activity assessed by number of steps per day for minimum one, up to seven years. Univariable and multivariable mixed effect models were used to investigate the annual change in STS, 6MWD and number of steps per day.
   Results: 202 COPD patients (17% COPD risk group (considers symptoms and future exacerbation risk to grade disease severity) A, 49% B, 4% C and 34% D) with a mean (min/max) follow-up time of 2.4 (0.9/6.8) years were annually assessed. The number of steps per day decreased significantly over time (annual mean (95% CI) of -451.0 (-605.3/-296.6) steps, p < 0.001) while STS and 6MWD remained stable.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that COPD patients are increasingly impaired in their daily PA while exercise capacity remains stable during the study period. Thus, the longitudinal decline in PA seems not to be explained by a concomitant reduction in exercise tolerance.

AB Background: Anti-MDA-5 antibody is closely associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) in amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM). Patients with ADM with anti-MDA-5 antibody sometimes develop fatal ILD in spite of intensive immunosuppressive therapy. However, an initial decrease after treatment in anti-MDA-5 antibody titers may not be predictive of subsequent better survival of the disease.
   Methods: To clarify immunoregulatory features of deadly ILD in ADM with the anti-MDA-5 antibody, we retrospectively examined clinical records of consecutive patients with anti-MDA-5 antibody positive ADM-ILD with preserved serum since 2000. Serum cytokine/growth factor (GF) protein concentration was measured using a cytokine panel analysis. We compared concentrations of each cytokine/GF between survivors and non-survivors and further examined changes in cytokines/GF levels during treatment in some patients.
   Results: Twenty-six patients were enrolled in the study. Nine out of 26 patients did not respond to intensive immunosuppressive therapy and died due to respiratory failure. We compared cytokine/GF concentrations and found that serum IL-15 before treatment was significantly elevated in non-survivors than in survivors (p<0.05). 11 out of 17 responders and 6 of 9 dead patients had preserved serum taken more than one time. We then calculated rates of change per day (slopes) in each cytokine/GF concentration. Comparison of slopes of cytokine/GF protein over the treatment duration showed that the slopes in non-survivors were significantly increased in IL-10 and IL-15 (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: IL-15, as well as IL-10, may play a key role in the progression of the patients with ADM-ILD with anti-MDA-5 antibody positive.

ID OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; COPD; CLASSIFICATION
AB Background: In 2017, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) proposed a new classification of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Material and methods: We contrasted the distribution of COPD patients according to GOLD 2017 and 2011 classifications, the temporal stability of the 2017 groups during 3 years follow-up and their association with all-cause mortality in the ECLIPSE cohort.
   Results: We found that GOLD 2017: (1) switched a substantial proportion of GOLD 2011C and D patients to A and B groups at recruitment; (2) about half of A, B and D patients remained in the same group at the end of follow-up, whereas 74% of C patients (the smallest group of all) changed, either because exacerbation rate decreased or dyspnea increased; and, (3) all-cause mortality by group was not significantly different between GOLD 2011 and 2017. Of note, mortality in B (16%) and D patients (18%) was similar, both with similar severity of airflow limitation, the best individual mortality risk factor.
   Conclusions: These results illustrate the cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of excluding FEV1 from GOLD 2017, and highlight both the clinical relevance of symptom assessment in the management of COPD and the prognostic capacity of FEV1.

AB Background: "Transitions of care" have been the focus of readmission reduction strategies for acute exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD). Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center (WFBMC) implemented a comprehensive care plan for AECOPD admissions in 2014 that also seeks to improve the diagnosis/treatment of COPD, strives for the optimal management of co-morbidities, and emphasizes hospice/palliative care in appropriate patients.
   Methods: A retrospective, electronic health record (EHR) based, observational cohort study was used to evaluate AECOPD admissions between 5/12/2014 to 6/28/2016. An existing AECOPD registry was used to determine care plan status, readmissions were identified from the EHR, and mortality information was obtained from the state of North Carolina. Propensity weighted, multiple logistic regression was used to compare the care plan (n=597) versus usual care (n=677) on readmission and mortality outcomes after covariate adjustment. Results: Enrollment in the care plan was associated with a reduced odds of 30-day all-cause readmission (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71-0.99), 30-day mortality (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.88), and the composite endpoint of 30-day, all-cause readmissions and mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.92). The plan also reduced AECOPD-specific readmissions at 90 days (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.96).
   Conclusion: A comprehensive care plan for patients hospitalized for AECOPD reduced the odds of all-cause readmission, mortality, and AECOPD specific readmission risk. This exploratory study reinforces the use of the AECOPD Care Plan at WFBMC. Future research should focus on a randomized, pragmatic clinical trial to further evaluate the impact of this plan on clinical outcomes.

AB Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a common life-threatening medical condition, with multiple underlying aetiologies. Diagnostic chest ultrasound provides accurate diagnosis of conditions that commonly cause ARF, and may improve overall diagnostic accuracy in critical care settings as compared to standard diagnostic approaches. Respiratory physicians are becoming increasingly familiar with ultrasound as a part of routine clinical practice, although the majority of data to date has focused on the emergency and intensive care settings.
   This review will examine the evidence for the use of diagnostic chest ultrasound, focusing on different levels of imaging efficacy; specifically ultrasound test attributes, impacts on clinician behaviour and impact on health outcomes. The evidence behind use of multi-modality ultrasound examinations in ARF will be reviewed.
   It is hoped that readers will become familiar with the advantages and potential issues with chest ultrasound, as well as evidence gaps in the field.

AB Background: Fatigue is a highly prevalent, challenging and understudied symptom of COPD, which influences the quality of life of patients. This study addresses the patient's perspective on the impact of fatigue on their daily lives and explores possible treatment options to tackle the burden of fatigue.
   Methods: Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten patients hospitalised for a COPD exacerbation and ten outpatients with COPD. Data were transcribed verbatim and coded in an iterative (deductive and inductive) coding process.
   Findings: Patients perceived severe negative impact of fatigue on their daily lives and emphasized that they were limited in physical, emotional, cognitive and social functioning. These limitations caused a high mental burden which challenged patients' coping resources and making fatigue a symptom difficult to accept. The majority of patients mentioned that they had, to some degree, lost the joy in life or in some cases, even lost the will to live. Patients reported the need for effective treatment and recommended a multidisciplinary approach and blended care, in which an online treatment to improve fatigue management is combined with face-to-face contact with a healthcare professional to increase social support.
   Discussion: These findings indicate that patients perceive the impact of fatigue on their daily lives to be a key factor in decreasing their quality of life. To increase awareness of fatigue in healthcare professionals and patients and to facilitate early fatigue self-management, a pro-active approach by healthcare professionals might be the best way to realize effective tailored treatment.

AB Background: Routine lung cancer surveillance has resulted in early detection of pulmonary nodules and masses. Combined endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and trans-esophageal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are approved methods for sampling lymph nodes or masses. Furthermore, EUS allows for adrenal sampling as part of staging, and can assist with fiducial placement for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
   Objectives: Promote use of EUS by interventional pulmonologists in the United States when diagnosing and staging lung cancer or when placing fiducials.
   Methods: All patients undergoing EUS and/or EBUS were serially entered into a prospectively maintained database. Only patients undergoing EUS guided lung and/or adrenal biopsy and/or fiducial placement were selected for analysis. All patients underwent a post-procedure chest radiograph and were followed outpatient.
   Results: 20 of 39 patients underwent sampling of a suspicious lung mass. An adequate sample was obtained in 19 of 20 patients. In all 19 patients a definitive diagnosis was achieved (95%). In all 13 patients who underwent adrenal sampling, presence or absence of metastasis was conclusively established. 6 patients successfully underwent fiducial placement. In all 39 patients, no major procedure related complications were noted for a period of 30 days. One patient had a small pneumothorax that resolved spontaneously.
   Conclusions: EUS can be safely performed by a trained interventional pulmonologist for the diagnosis of lung, adrenal masses and placement of fiducials. We think that interventional pulmonologists in the United States involved in lung cancer staging should receive training in EUS techniques.

AB Background: Omalizumab (anti-IgE monoclonal antibody) is an approved add-on therapy for Japanese patients with severe allergic asthma. As directed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Japan, a post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study on omalizumab was conducted between 2009 and 2017.
   Methods: The PMS observed safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients treated with open-label omalizumab for 52 weeks (with optional 2-year extension period). Primary safety outcomes included incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Primary efficacy outcomes included physician-assessed global evaluation of treatment effectiveness (GETE). Asthma-exacerbation-related events including requirement for additional systemic steroid therapy, hospitalization, emergency room visits, unscheduled doctor visits, and absenteeism were also evaluated.
   Results: Of 3893 patients registered, 3620 (age [mean +/- SD] 59.3 +/- 16.11 years) were evaluated for 52 weeks; 44.12% were aged >= 65 years and 64.45% were women. Overall, 32.24% reported AEs and 15.30% reported serious AEs. ADRs were seen in 292 (8.07%) patients. GETE results showed that the majority of patients experienced clinical improvements (58.29% at 16 weeks and 62.40% at 52 weeks). Nearly half of all patients (47.96%) were free from asthma exacerbations after therapy. Omalizumab also reduced all events related to asthma exacerbations. No specific ADRs were observed in the elderly population.
   Conclusions: This post-marketing study confirmed the clinically meaningful benefits of omalizumab in a majority of patients from Japan, and showed safety and efficacy in a real-life clinical setting to be consistent with previous reports.

AB Background: Recently, we have reported that asthma is characterized by prothrombotic blood alterations, which were related to the low-grade inflammatory state. Inflammation, however, may also lead to vascular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma levels of cellular fibronectin (cFN), a marker of vascular injury in asthmatics, and to analyze their impact on described previously prothrombotic blood alterations.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we investigated 164 adult stable asthmatics and 72 matched controls. Plasma cFN was measured using an ELISA. Its relations to inflammation, thrombin generation, fibrinolytic capacity, expressed as clot lysis time (CLT), and platelet markers were evaluated.
   Results: Asthma was associated with 50.1% higher plasma cFN levels as compared with controls (p < 0.001, after adjustment for potential confounders). There was a positive association of cFN with asthma severity and inverse with the FEV1/VC index (beta=0.2 [95% CI: 0.13-0.28] and beta=-0.15 [95% CI: -0.23 to -0.07], respectively). In asthmatics cFN positively correlated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (beta= 0.24 [95% CI: 0.16-0.32]), fibrinogen (beta= 0.13 [95% CI: 0.04-0.21]), interleukin-6 (beta= 0.23 [95% CI: 0.15-0.3]), platelet factor 4 (beta= 0.14 [95% CI: 0.06-0.21]), plasminogen (beta= 0.11 [95% CI: 0.04-0.19]) and CLT (beta= 0.35 [95% CI: 0.28-0.42]). In both groups cFN was related to the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) (beta= 0.51 [95% CI: 0.44-0.57], and beta= 0.17 [95% CI: 0.07-0.27], respectively). Multiple regression models showed that cFN was the most potent independent predictor of both ETP and CLT in asthmatics.
   Conclusion: Presented study is the first to show increased plasma cellular fibronectin in asthma, which is associated with disease severity, inflammation, and prothrombotic blood alterations. This novel observation suggests a previously unknown modulator of prothrombotic plasma properties in asthmatics.

AB Introduction: Advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is generally treated with platinum/ pemetrexedbased first-line therapy. Once the disease progresses, evidence for the efficacy of palliative treatments is lacking, and platinum re-challenge or single-agent chemotherapy are commonly used. To assess the effects of cytostatic or targeted therapy for treating MPM, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Material and methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched to identify published articles on second-line treatments for recurrent or advanced mesothelioma. Inclusion criteria were publication in the English language, describing clinical trials with 20 or more patients, and evaluability for efficacy and for receiving second-line systemic therapies. Data were pooled using number of events/number of evaluable patients, median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), according to a fixed or random effect model. Pooled median OS was the primary endpoint.
   Results: A total of 49 eligible studies (n= 3938 patients; range, 12-400) were identified. Median progressionfree survival (PFS) was 3.4 months (95% CI 2.87-3.93). Median pooled OS was 7.86 (95% CI 7.01-8.72). The pooled overall response rate (ORR) was 8.63% (95% CI 6-11.26), and the pooled disease control rate (DCR) was 54.8% (95% CI 48.9-60.6). Median pooled OS with platinum-and pemetrexed-based chemotherapy were 7.93 and 7.78 months, respectively.
   Conclusions: There remains uncertainty about the ideal second-line agent for MPM. Based on this meta-analysis, palliative chemotherapy or other experimental agents can be considered for patients with MPM who desire further treatment after their disease has progressed, during or after first-line therapy.

AB Background: Eosinophilic asthma is characterized by persistently elevated blood eosinophils, adult-onset asthma and corticosteroid resistance. For stratified medicine purposes one single measurement of blood eosinophils or exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is commonly used. The aim of this study was to investigate in patients with newonset asthma whether persistent blood eosinophilia can be predicted with one single measurement of these biomarkers.
   Methods: Blood eosinophils and exhaled nitric oxide levels were measured at yearly intervals over 5 years in 114 adults with new-onset asthma on inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Two definitions of persistent blood eosinophilia were used (1); blood eosinophils at every visit = 0.30x10(9)/L, or (2) = 0.40x10(9)/L. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed. Diagnostic cut-off values were defined at a positive predictive value of 95% (or the highest achievable).
   Results: Using definition 1 (blood eosinophils = 0.30x109/L) the cut-off value for a single measurement of blood eosinophils was 0.47x10(9)/L. For definition 2 (= 0.40x109/L) the cut-off value was 0.49x1(0)9/L. Cutoff values for persistently low blood eosinophils were 0.17x10(9)/L for definition (1) and 0.21x10(9)/L for definition (2), respectively. For FeNO no cut-off values with sufficient accuracy could be defined.
   Conclusion: We showed that by using high and low cut-off values, one single measurement of blood eosinophils, but not FeNO in the initial phase of new-onset asthma in adults can be used to predict persistence or absence of blood eosinophilia in asthma.

AB Both asthma and rhinosinusitis are complex and heterogeneous diseases and, importantly, they often coexist: these diseases can be concomitant in 35-65% of affected children, according to different studies. Thus, evaluating this comorbidity in the clinical practice should be paramount. In this review, we focused our discussion on the multiple pathophysiological aspects that may link rhinosinusitis and asthma in the pediatric population. Although rhinosinusitis may exacerbate asthma through several mechanisms occurring by contiguity, actually this aspect seems to be only one component of the complex interplay between upper and lower airways. In particular, the onset of an important and persistent Th2-driven inflammatory process dominated by eosinophils presence at one site of the airways, may release into the bloodstream several cytokines; in their turn, those can lead to the stimulation of the bone marrow, which may function as a systemic amplifier of such an eosinophilic inflammation.

AB Objectives: Influenza and Influenza-like syndromes (I-LSs) are very common events in general practice, and their relevance is frequently underestimated. Aim of the study was to assess the economic impact of influenza and Influenza-like syndromes (I-LSs) in the Italian general population by using real-world data from a retrospective database.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey via Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) was carried out by using a specific questionnaire which is able to assess the rate of infectious episodes, together with subject's behavior in case of influenza or I-LSs, and prescribed therapy. Collected data were statistically analyzed to calculate the economic impact of influenza and I-LSs episodes according to both the National Health System Perspective (NHS-P) and the Italian Families Perspective (S-P). The components of cost were: influenza vaccination, used drugs, General Practitioner (GP) visits, Emergency Room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and productivity loss.
   Results: According to the NHS-P, the annual cost for managing influenza or I-LSs amounted to (sic) 60.24, corresponding to (sic) 38.71 per episode. About 72% of the cost was due to GP/ER visits and hospitalization; 22% to drugs, and 6% to vaccination. In the IF-P, the annual cost increased to (sic) 249.70 ((sic) 140.33 per episode) and almost 90% of the cost was related to workdays lost, while only 11% and 1.3% were due to drugs and vaccination, respectively. Annual cost was highly related to the mean duration of influenza or I-LSs episodes in both perspectives ((sic) 111-388 in IF-P and (sic) 56-68 in NHS-P). Furthermore, the number of workdays lost due to these episodes showed a significant impact on the overall cost ((sic) 195-304) only in the NHS-P.
   Conclusions: Influenza and I-LSs have a not negligible economic impact, both for the NHS and for the society. Resource consumption is considerable in the NHS-P, while the productivity loss due to people absenteeism causes the most relevant impact in the IF-P.

   MANEUVERS
AB Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a condition of varied etiology characterized by the acute onset (within 1 week of the inciting event) of hypoxemia, reduced lung compliance, diffuse lung inflammation and bilateral opacities on chest imaging attributable to noncardiogenic (increased permeability) pulmonary edema. Although multi-organ failure is the most common cause of death in ARDS, an estimated 10-15% of the deaths in ARDS are caused due to refractory hypoxemia, i.e.-hypoxemia despite lung protective conventional ventilator modes. In these cases, clinicians may resort to other measures with less robust evidence -referred to as "salvage therapies". These include proning, 48 h of paralysis early in the course of ARDS, various recruitment maneuvers, unconventional ventilator modes, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). All the salvage therapies described have been associated with improved oxygenation, but with the exception of proning and 48 h of paralysis early in the course of ARDS, none of them have a proven mortality benefit. Based on the current evidence, no salvage therapy has been shown to be superior to the others and each of them is associated with its own risks and benefits. Hence, the order of application of these therapies varies in different institutions and should be applied following a risk-benefit analysis specific to the patient and local experience. This review explores the rationale, evidence, advantages and risks behind each of these strategies.

AB Background: Airflow limitation in COPD is caused by a mixture of small airways obstruction and alveolar destruction.
   Objective: To evaluate the contributions of these factors to airflow limitation through measurement of two biomarkers, pentosidine and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which reflect pathology or function of the lower respiratory tract of COPD.
   Methods: We measured pentosidine and VEGF levels in induced sputum from 23 non-smokers, 26 smokers without COPD, and 43 smokers with COPD. We evaluated the correlations of two biomarkers levels with the grade of low attenuation area (LAA) in high-resolution computed tomographic scans and the Delta N-2 from the nitrogen washout curve.
   Results: Pentosidine levels were significantly higher in smokers with COPD than in non-smokers and smokers without COPD. In contrast, VEGF levels were significantly lower in smokers without COPD than in non-smokers, and further decreased in smokers with COPD. In the four-stage classification of LAA grading, pentosidine levels steeply increased from grade I to., while VEGF levels decreased with increasing severity of LAA grade. Pentosidine levels were positively correlated with Delta N-2 in COPD patients with mild emphysema. In contrast, VEGF levels were inversely correlated with Delta N-2 in COPD patients with severe emphysema.
   Conclusion: Pentosidine level is responsible for the severity of small airways obstruction, while VEGF level reflects the magnitude of alveolar destruction. Thus, simultaneous measurement of pentosidine and VEGF levels may be a promising approach to discriminate the severity of small airways obstruction and alveolar destruction in the lower respiratory tract of COPD.

TI High risk of subclinical atherosclerosis in COPD exacerbator phenotype

AB It is not known whether COPD exacerbations contribute to an increased vascular risk already associated with the disease. For this reason, we prospectively evaluated 127 patients referred for a monographic COPD consultation. We classify as exacerbators those who had experienced two or more moderate exacerbations in the previous year, or who had had a hospital admission. All underwent a blood analysis, respiratory function tests, global cardiovascular and coronary risk estimates (with four of the most frequently used scores, and the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Coronaropathy Risk (COPDCoRi) score, respectively); and an EcoDoppler to measure carotid intima-media thickness and the ankle-brachial index.
   Finally, we included 50 patients with exacerbator phenotypes and 57 with non-exacerbator phenotypes, ranging from 63 +/- 7 years old, 74% of whom were male. The exacerbator phenotype increased the risk of carotid intima-media thickness above the 75th percentile range by a factor of almost three, independently of the severity of COPD and global cardiovascular risk. The association between the exacerbator phenotype and high cIMT was more evident in patients under 65.
   In conclusion, the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis is independently associated with the exacerbator phenotype, with more pronounced differences in younger patient; which suggests that we should intensify control of vascular risk factors in these groups of patients.

AB Background: The Institute of Medicine emphasizes care timeliness as an important quality metric. We assessed treatment timeliness in stage I-IIIA lung cancer patients deemed eligible for curative intent therapy and analyzed the relationship between time to treatment (TTT) and timely treatment (TT) with survival.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive cases of stage I-IIIA lung cancer deemed eligible for curative intent therapy at the VA San Diego Healthcare System between 10/2010-4/2017. We defined TTT as days from chest tumor board to treatment initiation and TT using guideline recommendations. We used multivariable (MVA) Cox proportional hazards regressions for survival analyses.
   Results: In 177 veterans, the median TTT was 35 days (29 days for chemoradiation, 36 for surgical resection, 42 for definitive radiation). TT occurred in 33% or 77% of patients when the most or least timely guideline recommendation was used, respectively. Patient characteristics associated with longer TTT included other cancer history, high simplified comorbidity score, stage I disease, and definitive radiation treatment. In MVA, TTT and TT [HR 0.53 (95% CI 0.27, 1.01) for least timely definition] were not associated with OS in stage I-IIIA patients, or disease-free survival in subgroup analyses of 122 stage I patients [HR 1.49 (0.62, 3.59) for least timely definition].
   Conclusion: Treatment was timely in 33-77% of veterans with lung cancer deemed eligible for curative intent therapy. TTT and TT were not associated with survival. The time interval between diagnosis and treatment may offer an opportunity to deliver or improve other cancer care.

AB Background: Non-adherence to asthma treatment is a contributing factor for poorly controlled asthma. Aim: The aim of this systematic review is to explore patients' perceptions of their inhaled asthma treatment, and how these relate to adherence, using both qualitative and quantitative data.
   Methods: Pre-determined search terms and inclusion criteria were used to search electronic databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO). Two researchers screened titles and abstracts using the Rayyan web app and data were extracted in relation to psychological components (beliefs about, and attitudes towards, medicines) and adherence.
   Results: Of 1638 papers, 36 met the inclusion criteria. Key themes were: Perceived need for treatment - all 12 studies using the BMQ to measure patients' perceived need for treatment found that patients' beliefs about their necessity for treatment were associated with adherence-; Concerns about treatment - immediate and long-term side effects (58%), worries about safety (19%), and potential addiction to asthma medication (31%)-; and Perceived social stigma -22% of studies reported that embarrassment contributed to poor adherence.
   Conclusions: Acknowledging and addressing patient treatment beliefs and perceptual barriers to adherence is integral to designing adherence interventions for asthma patients. Further research is needed to better our understanding of the relationship between treatment perceptions and adherence.

AB Background: Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) is a rare subset of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. No large-scale clinical studies of PPFE have been published. The aim of the study was to clarify the clinical and physiological characteristics of PPFE in Japan
   Methods: This was a retrospective, nationwide, and multicenter study in Japan. We reviewed 52 patients with PPFE, diagnosed after multidisciplinary discussions.
   Results: Flat chest index, defined as the ratio of anteroposterior diameter to transverse diameter of thoracic cage at the level of 6th thoracic vertebra, correlated positively with body mass index (BMI) (r=0.340, p=0.013) and percentage of predicted value of forced vital capacity (FVC % pred) (r=0.355, p=0.012), and negatively with the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC) (r=-0.312, p=0.042). RV/TLC correlated negatively with BMI (r=-0.746, p < 0.0001) and FVC % pred (r=-0.507, p=0.0005), and positively with age, and physiological variables (GAP) scores (r=0.332, p=0.030). The median survival time and the cumulative 5-year survival rate were 96 months and 58%, respectively. Patients with KL-6 level > 600 (U/mL) survived shorter than those with < 600 (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Low BMI, decreased FVC and increased RV/TLC in PPFE may be related to the progression of flattened chest cage which impairs distension of chest cage at inspiration. Elevated serum levels of KL-6 suggest a poor prognosis of PPFE.

AB Background: The Asthma Salford Lung Study demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of initiating once-daily inhaled fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) versus continuing usual care (UC) in asthma patients in UK primary care [1]. Here, we report a detailed analysis of patient-reported outcome (PRO) endpoints.
   Methods: Adults with symptomatic asthma maintained on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) +/- long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABA) were randomized 1:1 to initiate FF/VI (100 [200]/25 mu g) or continue UC. PROs were measured using the Asthma Control Test (ACT), Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ [S]), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment:asthma questionnaire, and EQ-5D-3L (EuroQol 5-Dimensions 3-Levels) questionnaire, at timepoints across the 12-month study period.
   Results: The individual components of ACT response (total score >= 20 or improvement from baseline >= 3) both contributed to the composite primary effectiveness endpoint at Week 24, with odds ratios favoring FF/VI over UC in both cases. Patients initiating FF/VI versus continuing UC were more likely to maintain/improve asthma control, regardless of baseline control status. The odds of patients being responders on AQLQ (S) total score and on individual AQLQ domains at Week 52 were significantly higher for FF/VI versus UC (all p<.001). FF/VI was associated with significantly greater reductions in overall work and activity impairment due to asthma (both p<.001), and a significantly greater change from baseline in EQ visual analogue scale score (p=.007), versus UC at Week 52. PRO findings were consistent across baseline ICS and ICS/LABA subsets.
   Conclusions: Initiation of FF/VI versus continuing UC was associated with consistent improvements in PROs.

AB BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic double aortic arches are a unique occurrence.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An incidental finding of a double aortic arch in an elderly male was discovered during workup of a transient ischemic attack. The following case presentation details an effective treatment approach in cerebrovascular stenting in a patient with variant aortic arch anatomy. The initial diagnostic cerebral angiogram was performed via transfemoral approach and was quite challenging.
   CONCLUSIONS: Faced with challenging anatomy, the radial artery approach is a viable option when navigating into the cerebrovascular anatomy for stenting when proximal variants such as a double aortic arch are identified.

AB We reviewed recent studies on ischemic penumbra, including the evolution of the definitions of ischemic penumbra and observations on the characteristics of blood flow and the molecular evolutionary mechanism of ischemic tissues; at the same time, a brief summary of current clinical treatment methods were included. From the perspective of neuroimaging and clinical treatment, the characteristics of cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption, cell water content, and metabolites were analyzed, to evaluate the diagnosis and evolution of ischemic penumbra. The analysis of the evolutionary characteristics of multiple gene molecules and metabolites may provide ideas for clinical imaging diagnosis and clinical treatment, also allow the combination of multiparameter imaging indexes to be more accurate and effective for the assessment of ischemic penumbra. The research hotspot of imaging on the ischemic penumbra region in the future may be more focused on reflecting the evolutionary characteristics of local metabolites in the ischemic area. Using multimodality imaging to evaluate IP zones and guide the formulation of clinical treatment protocols.

   carcinomatosis; Multiple sclerosis; Tumor metastasis; Tumor-to-lesion

ID SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: The term "tumor-to-lesion metastasis"is an extension of "tumor-to-tumor metastasis,"which is a rare but well-documented phenomenon. Tumor metastasis to the meninges and/or central nervous system (CNS) is rare in patents with multiple sclerosis (MS), although MS lesions bear many similarities to the primary tumor microenvironment and metastatic niche. We present the first case of malignant tumor metastasis to MS lesions with immunophenotyping of inflammatory cells in the metastatic foci.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old male patient with a 6-year history of MS and newly diagnosed lung carcinoma developed carcinoma metastases in the meninges and CNS, as well as into mixed active/inactive MS lesions. The carcinoma-hosting MS lesions exhibited abundant macrophages/microglia with ongoing demyelination but rare T cells. In comparison, a 46-year-old female patient with a 21-month history of MS and newly diagnosed gastric carcinoma was found to have leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and separate active MS lesions containing not only frequent macrophages/microglia but also T cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: The carcinoma-hosting MS lesions are unlike typical active lesions but recapitulate the CNS metastatic niche. Our observations suggest that metastasis-hosting MS lesions might require a distinct immune microenvironment to be permissive to the seeding and growth of metastatic tumors.

AB BACKGROUND: Gangliogliomas (GGs) are rare intra-axial tumors. Cerebellar seizures caused by GGs have been described only rarely. Pigmented neural cell tumors are well described in the literature but are infrequent, especially when presenting as primary neuroepithelial tumors. Only 5 cases of pigmented GG have been reported previously, including 4 in the pediatric population.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 17-year-old female presented to us with cerebellar seizures, which resolved after tumor excision. Histopathological examination revealed a pigmented GG.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present the sixth documented case of a pigmented ganglioglioma, the first such case reported in cerebellar location, associated with a rare presentation of cerebellar seizures.

   INNER-EAR; CHILDREN; MANAGEMENT; AGENESIS
AB BACKGROUND: Duane syndrome is a congenital eye movement disorder characterized by congenital malformation of the abducens nucleus. Thrombogenic conditions during development may lead to vascular anomalies in Duane syndrome; however, the presence of a giant aneurysm in this patient population is a rarely documented phenomenon.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We reported a case of a large cerebral aneurysm in a pediatric patient with Duane syndrome and performed a review of the literature to identify other potential cases and associations. The pathophysiologic hallmarks of Duane syndrome that lead to alterations in the fetal cerebral vasculature and that may form the basis for a potential mechanism for aneurysm formation were reviewed in this study. The patient was an 11-year-old female with Duane syndrome who presented with seizures. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large, heterogeneously enhancing right temporal mass. Intraoperatively, the mass was revealed to be a partially thrombosed giant middle cerebral artery aneurysm. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course without residual aneurysm presented on postoperative angiogram. No clinical or radiographic appearance of recurrent aneurysm was evident at her 6-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiology of vascular anomalies with Duane syndrome may be related to thrombogenic conditions during development leading to alterations in cerebral fetal vasculature. Strong consideration for vascular anomaly should be given when evaluating cerebral masses in patients with Duane syndrome.

AB BACKGROUND: The signs and pathomechanism of Miyazaki syndrome is presented through the case of a young female patient.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The 33-year-old patient had undergone placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt with a pressure-adjustable valve for communicating hydrocephalus years before presenting to our department with the complaints of constant headache and unsteady gait. On the basis of the clinical picture and her history, plain and contrast-enhanced cranial and whole spine magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography examinations were performed, with the scans revealing signs indicative of cerebrospinal fluid hypotension typical of Miyazaki syndrome.
   CONCLUSION: The article discusses the available literature suggesting the underlying cause in such cases to be the dysfunction of the Starling resistor mechanism due to an improperly adjusted ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which results in excessive cerebrospinal fluid loss accompanied by consequent cerebral venous overflow with vertebral venous engorgement and compressive cervical myelopathy.

DT Article
DE Endoscope; Lumbar synovial cysts; Transfacet approach
ID FACET JOINT CYSTS; FACETECTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: There are currently no high-quality studies on the optimal therapeutic approach for juxtafacet cyst, as treatment guidelines have not been developed. Herein, a novel technique in which we used an endoscopic transfacet approach to treat a patient with symptomatic lumbar synovial cyst is presented.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 87-year-old man presented with severe dull pain in the right anterior thigh. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed disc extrusion over the central canal zone at the L2-L3 and L4-L5 levels and an ovoid lesion with a hyperintense center plus a hypointense rim on the T2-weighted image. The lesion was located over the medial side of the right juxtafacet region at the L2-L3 level, causing thecal sac compression. After the operation, the visual analog pain scale improved with a value of 0-1/10, and straight leg raise test was negative. Microscopically, cystic fibrous tissue with focal myxoid degeneration, fibrin exudate, and scant synovial-like lining was observed. These findings were consistent with clinical synovial cyst. Three months later, lumbar magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and no evidence of cyst was disclosed. Lumbar computed tomography revealed the upper part of left L2-L3 facet joint was removed. The patient did not report any radicular pain during the 6-month follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar surgery could be a new option for the management of lumbar synovial cysts, especially when general anesthesia is not appropriate for the patient.

   ABSENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Sciatic neuralgia (SN) is a type of pain commonly associated with lumbosacral radiculopathy. May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a disease characterized by venous congestion in the left common iliac vein (LCIV) due to right common iliac artery compression. A case of MTS with SN as the first presenting symptom is described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old man gradually developed left SN; however, radiologic examination showed no causal findings. Conservative medical treatment did not result in satisfactory pain relief. During the follow-up period, edema and brownish skin pigmentation were noted on the left crural region. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of lumbar spine revealed vascular enlargement around the spine and compression of the LCIV by the right common iliac artery. Furthermore, the left S1 nerve root was compressed by enlarged veins, which was thought to be the cause of the left S1 radiculopathy and SN. After the stenosed part of the LCIV was expanded, the pain and edema in the left leg disappeared.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of SN associated with MTS. MTS should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of SN. Thus, symptoms such as pain, edema, and skin hyperpigmentation on the left leg should be closely noted.

DE Abdominal hemorrhage; Endovascular treatment; Segmental arterial
   mediolysis; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Vertebral artery dissection
AB BACKGROUND: Segmental arterial mediolysis is a rare disease characterized by idiopathic noninflammatory vasculopathy involving small to medium arteries. Here, we report a case of ruptured cerebral and abdominal aneurysms, which were successfully treated using emergency endovascular coil embolization.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old male suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by the rupture of the right vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm, which was treated using emergency endovascular coiling. Iatrogenic dissection of the left vertebral artery occurred during the procedure. A stent was placed, and antivasospasm therapy was initiated after operation. Eight days after admission, the patient experienced sudden hypovolemic shock because of an abdominal hemorrhage, which was diagnosed as the rupture of an aneurysm in the accessory middle colic artery and treated with urgent coil embolization.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is extremely rare for a subarachnoid and an abdominal hemorrhage to occur simultaneously during hospitalization. Here, owing to the vulnerability of the unaffected vertebral artery during the initial procedure, segmental arterial mediolysis was diagnosed.

ID EPIDURAL BLOOD PATCH; SPONTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL HYPOTENSION; SPINAL-CORD
   HERNIATION; CSF LEAKS
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) has been increasingly recognized as a phenomenon caused by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases of SIH resulting from CSF leak from a meningeal diverticulum at the C2 nerve root sleeve. The first case is that of a 46-year-old man who experienced orthostatic headache after a bicycle accident at age 45. Computed tomography (CT) myelography revealed CSF leaks at the C1-2 level. He underwent epidural blood patch therapy, but it was unsuccessful. Next, we performed direct surgery and found a meningeal diverticulum originating from the left C2 nerve root; therefore, we ligated the diverticulum. His symptoms and image findings strikingly improved after surgery. The second case is that of a 45-year-old man who experienced orthostatic headache 1 month after jumping into a river. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed bilateral subdural hematoma. CT myelography revealed CSF leaks at the C1-2 level and multiple cyst formations at the cervical and thoracic nerve root sleeves. epidural blood patch was performed, and his symptoms immediately improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies have reported that meningeal diverticulum is involved in various cases of CSF leaks. The 2 cases indicate that traumatic accidents, such as back-and-forth neck movement or falls, presumably induce an increase in CSF pressure, followed by the rupture of an existing meningeal diverticulum, leading to CSF leak.

ID TORKILDSEN SHUNT; HYDROCEPHALUS; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: To present a hitherto unreported modification of the classic Torkildsen procedure: passing a catheter intracranially, between the third ventricle and cisterna magna.
   METHODS: We applied our technique to a 56-year-old man who presented to our department for treatment of a pineal region mass.
   RESULTS: The patient was placed in sitting position and the mass was gross totally removed through a supracerebellar infratentorial approach. After the completion of the tumor resection, the patency of the cerebral aqueduct was checked, but the permeability was doubtful. During the same procedure, a shunt was inserted, under direct microsurgical control, into the third ventricle and passed over the cerebellar surface into the cisterna magna. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from our unit with no neurological deficits and able to carry on with his day-to-day life.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrates that ventriculocisternal shunting can successfully be used in selected cases. The variation we describe can be a valuable surgical strategy in patients with pineal region masses, in whom a supracerebellar infratentorial route is used and in whom uncertainty exists regarding the patency of the sylvian aqueduct.

AB OBJECTIVE: Consensus regarding selection of synthetic versus autologous flap reimplantation for cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy has not been reached and the multiple factors considered for each patient make comparative analysis challenging. This study examines the association between choice of material and related complications.
   METHODS: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed using PubMed for articles reporting delayed cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy using a cohort design comparing autologous bone and synthetic implants. Extracted data included implant material and incidence of infection, reoperations related to implant, wound complications, and resorption.
   RESULTS: One randomized controlled trial and 11 cohort studies were included for a total of 1586 implants (950 bone, 636 synthetic). Autologous implants had significantly more reoperations than did synthetic implants (n = 1586 implants; odds ratio [OR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-2.61). Reoperations were most often because of resorption (54%, n = 159/295) followed by infection (41%, n = 121/295). The pooled incidence of resorption in autologous implants was 20% (n = 159/791). Among the other outcomes, there was no significant difference for infections (n = 1586; OR, 1.24; CI, 0.82-1.88) or wound complications (n = 678; OR, 0.56; CI, 0.22-1.45). For the trauma subpopulation, there was no significant difference in infection rate with either material (n = 197; OR, 1.89; CI; 0.59-6.09).
   CONCLUSIONS: Autologous implants had significantly more reoperations primarily because if the intrinsic risk of resorption (level of evidence 3b).

DT Article
DE Arrow; Bolt; Crossbow; Penetrating brain injury; Self-inflicted;
   Traumatic brain injury
AB BACKGROUND: Although gun-related penetrating traumatic brain injuries make up the majority of cranial missile injuries, low-velocity penetrating injuries present significant clinical difficulties that cannot necessarily be identically managed. Bow hunting is an increasingly popular pastime, and a crossbow allows a unique mechanism to cause a self-inflicted cranial injury with a large, low-velocity projectile. Historically, arrow removal is described in an operating room setting, which provides limited knowledge of the location of vascular injury in the setting of postremoval hemorrhage, and may represent an inefficient use of operating room availability.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients presented after self-inflicted cranial crossbow injuries. Both were neurologically salvageable. Initial assessment with computed tomography angiography allowed triage into likely or unlikely vascular injury. Arrow removal was performed in a radiology setting rather than in the operating room to allow immediate postremoval imaging to localize hemorrhage. While an operating room was on standby, neither patient required neurosurgical operative intervention. Both patients made a good recovery with no further injury caused by arrow removal.
   CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel approach to retained cranial arrow removal in a radiologic, rather than operative, setting and describe its relative benefits over traditional removal in the operating room.

AB It has been 125 years since the so-called initial use of bone wax (BW) by Sir Victor Horsley, and a review of this age-old hemostatic agent seems appropriate. The first use of BW for hemostasis occurred in the eighteenth century, when modeling or candle wax was used for hemostasis. Although the pioneers in the use of BW in craniofacial surgeries were Jean Louis Belloq, Khristian Khristianovich Salomon, and Francois Magendie, the first successful use in neurosurgery was demonstrated by Henri Ferdinand Dolbeau in 1864 after extirpation of a frontal osteoma. This technique was further popularized by Sir Victor Alexander Haden Horsley, the father of British neurosurgery, who is often incorrectly mentioned as the inventor of BW. Originally derived from beeswax, the currently available commercial preparation also contains paraffin wax and isopropyl palmitate. The main action being mechanical tamponade, BW has found several other uses in neurosurgery, other than being a hemostatic agent. Although it is cost-effective, the use of BW is associated with several complications also, including ineffective bone healing and infection. Several alternatives are being developed, but none are yet a full replacement for "Horsley's wax."

ID NAVIGATION; SURGERY; NEUROSURGERY; TECHNOLOGY
AB OBJECTIVE: Recently, the neuronavigation system (NS) has become an essential intraoperative tool for many neurosurgical procedures, allowing for precise lesion localization. It is particularly important to avoid errors during the navigation process. Here we report a novel technique using palatal positioning of the patient tracker to ensure optimal accuracy during magnetic navigation in various neurosurgical procedures.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included a total of 34 patients treated in our institution between June 2017 and January 2018. The patients were split into 2 groups who underwent surgery under general anesthesia: a microscopic transcranial group and an endoscopic endonasal group. Preoperative and postoperative navigation accuracy was assessed by 2 neurosurgeons.
   RESULTS: After our surgical planning navigation protocol was applied, both transcranial and endonasal procedures were successfully performed under navigation guidance in all but 1 patient. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications related to the tracker mounted under the hard palate. In 33 cases a maximal tracking view and optimal navigation accuracy was achieved, for a success rate of 97%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The positioning of the patient tracker under the hard palate proved safe, accurate, and feasible in 97% of our patients. In our case series, it met the main goal of avoiding device displacement without a sense of invasiveness and postoperative patient discomfort.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary intracranial rhabdomyosarcoma is a very rare malignant tumor. Owing to moderately vascular and firm characteristics of the tumor, complete removal without complications is often difficult. In pediatric patients, the volume of total blood is less than in adults, and minimal intraoperative hemorrhage is desirable.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 6-year-old boy presented with ataxia and was found to have a large cerebellopontine angle tumor and hydrocephalus. The patient underwent preoperative coil embolization of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery to decrease tumor vascularity, and gross total removal was achieved on the same day via a suboccipital approach. Pathologic diagnosis was rhabdomyosarcoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Successfully resection of primary intracranial rhabdomyosarcoma was achieved after preoperative embolization. Tumor vascularity was significantly reduced, and gross total removal was achieved safely with less hemorrhage.

   RARE VARIANT; TUMORS; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Ependymoma accounts for 3%-9% of all neuroepithelial tumors. Giant cell ependymoma (GCE) is a rare and distinct variant, with only 22 cases described in the literature. The 2007 World Health Organization classification first acknowledged this rare subtype. The cytologic features of GCE include the presence of pleomorphic giant cells with several cellular atypias, which at intraoperative frozen diagnosis may appear to be high-grade glial lesions. Despite its apparently malignant histology, GCE seems to be a neoplasm with a relatively good prognosis. Extended tumor removal is the gold standard without adjuvant treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the first case, to our knowledge, of GCE situated at the cervicomedullary junction in a 62-year-old patient. Surgery was performed with combined intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials. Intraoperative frozen diagnosis revealed a high-grade glial neoplasm; however, gross total resection was achieved. The definitive diagnosis was GCE. At follow-up evaluation 11 years after surgery, the patient did not present with any tumor recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: As the intraoperative diagnosis can be misleading, whenever a cleavage plane is recognized, it is essential to perform a gross total resection with the aid of intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring, to improve prognosis and neurologic outcome. Data reported in the literature show that prognosis is mainly influenced by grade of resection.

   APPROACH; CAVERNOUS HEMANGIOMA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MENINGES; CANCER; ORBIT
AB BACKGROUND: Tumors extending into the optic canal can cause progressive visual impairment because of optic nerve compression. Prompt surgical resection is often necessary. When the tumor is located medially in the optic canal, endoscopic transnasal surgery provides a safer, less invasive alternative to a transcranial approach.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We recently encountered a case of small solitary fibrous tumor in the optic canal causing rapid visual deterioration. The radiographic findings of preoperative imaging studies were compatible with those of meningioma; however, unlike meningioma, bleeding from the tumor was profuse during the operation. The endoscopic transnasal approach was effective for handling the highly vascularized tumor in this delicate region, and gross total removal was achieved with postoperative gradual improvement in his visual function. Nevertheless, the tumor recurred after 6 months, and re-resection was performed using the same surgical corridor, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic transnasal surgery is a valuable option for aggressive lesions in the optic canal. Although the efficacy of radiotherapy for solitary fibrous tumor remains controversial, it should be considered when the tumor shows progressive features.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB In anterosuperior-projecting anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysms, the aneurysm dome usually adheres to 1 or both proximal A2 segments, which may present technical difficulties. This video demonstrates microsurgical clipping of a ruptured anterosuperior-projecting ACoA aneurysm. A 52-year-old male presented with a Hunt-Hess grade II subarachnoid hemorrhage. Computed tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and sylvian and interhemispheric fissures. Angiography demonstrated a wide-necked ACoA aneurysm projecting anterosuperiorly. Considering the risk of recurrence, the patient decided to accept surgical treatment. The patient was positioned supine, and the aneurysm was exposed via the lateral supraorbital approach. The carotid cistern and optic cistern were opened to release cerebrospinal fluid and achieve adequate brain relaxation. A subpial resection of a small portion of the gyrus rectus was performed to visualize the ipsilateral A2, recurrent artery of Heubner, and base of the aneurysm. A plane was dissected between the anterior aspect of both the A2 segment and posterior aspect of the aneurysm. A straight clip was placed parallel to the ACoA to completely obliterate the aneurysm. Postoperative angiography confirmed complete obliteration of the aneurysm. The patient recovered well without any complications. Successful treatment requires preoperative surgical planning, precise dissection, and preservation of critical structures. With adherence to these general principles, these aneurysms can be treated safely and effectively.

DT Article
DE Developing world; Head injury; Head trauma; Machete; Nicaragua
ID TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: The neurosurgical literature rarely describes managing open head injuries caused by machetes, although this is a common head injury in developing countries. We present our experience managing cranial machete injuries in Nicaragua over a 5-year period.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified patients admitted to a neurosurgery service for cranial machete injury.
   RESULTS: Among 51 patients studied, the majority (n = 42, 82%) presented with mild neurologic deficits (Glasgow Coma Scale score >= 14). Nondepressed skull fracture (25/37, 68%) was the most common injury identified on skull radiography, and pneumocephalus (15/29, 52%) was the most common injury identified with computed tomography. Overall, 38 patients (75%) underwent surgical intervention for 1 or more conditions, including laceration length >= 10 cm (n = 20), open intracranial wound (n = 8), pneumocephalus (n = 7), cerebral contusion (n = 6), intracranial hemorrhage (n = 5), and depressed fracture (n[5). All patients received aggressive antibiotic therapy. Patients without intracranial injury received a 7-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone, followed by a 10-day course of oral ciprofloxacin. Patients with violation of the dura received a 7- to 14-day course of intravenous metronidazole, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin, followed by a 10-day course of oral ciprofloxacin. Postoperative complications included a visible skull defect (n = 6), infection (n = 3), and unspecified neurologic (n = 2) and mixed (n = 1) complications. At discharge, most patients had only minimal disabilities (47/51, 92%). In-hospital mortality rate was zero.
   CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive approach to managing open head injury caused by machete yields good outcomes, with the majority of patients experiencing minimal disability at hospital discharge and a low rate of infection.

DE Case report; Gamma Knife radiosurgery; Superior laryngeal neuralgia
ID TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA; PAIN; NECK
AB BACKGROUND: Superior laryngeal neuralgia (SLN) is a relatively rare disorder that is characterized by neck pain. There are only a few reported cases and treatment options for SLN to date. In this study, we report 3 patients with SLN who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) at the time of diagnosis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: For all 3 patients, GKRS was administered using a 4-mm collimator to deliver a single shot of 80 Gy of radiation (100% isodose line). The target was set at the jugular foramen where the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves emerge from the skull. Follow-up assessments were performed at 32, 31, and 30 months after GKRS. The 3 patients described pain relief at 3 months, 2 days, and 6 weeks. None of the patients developed neurologic deficits during the follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report provides encouraging evidence that GKRS represents an effective, safe, and relatively durable noninvasive treatment option for patients with SLN.

AB The description of paraplegia is considered a milestone in the history of neurology. The Egyptians provided excellent descriptions of spinal cord injuries, the Bible has several references to paraplegia, and, more recently, the pioneers of neurology described the classic syndromes related to spinal injuries and paraplegia. Here, we describe an ancient observation by the Assyrian people of paraplegia in an animal. In ancient Assyria, lion hunting was a ritualized activity conducted for political and religious purposes. The Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal, a series of Assyrian palace reliefs from the North Palace at Nineveh dating from approximately 645 BCE, which is now in the British Museum in London, UK, shows King Ashurbanipal hunting lions. Applying modern knowledge of mammalian dermatomes to the images, we reveal a detailed and precise observation of paraplegia after spinal cord injury.

ID PRIMARY CNS LYMPHOMA; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage at presentation in primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is rare. We encountered a case of primary CNS lymphoma presenting as a growing intracerebral hemorrhage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 80-year-old man presented with mild dysarthria. Computed tomography demonstrated a round, high-density mass with surrounding vasogenic edema in the left frontal lobe. Although the patient was placed on antihypertensive therapy for suspected subacute subcortical hemorrhage, neurologic symptoms gradually worsened. Computed tomography after 2 weeks revealed that the high-density lesion and surrounding edema had increased in size compared with previous images. The patient had been transferred to our hospital 14 days after admission to another institution. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass lesion comprising hemorrhage of different phases in the left frontal lobe. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging demonstrated a mass lesion with heterogeneous enhancement in the left frontal lobe. The patient underwent craniotomy with gross total removal of the hemorrhagic lesion. The histopathologic diagnosis was diffuse large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and immunohistochemistry showed high immunoreactivity for vascular endothelial growth factor.
   CONCLUSION: Although exceedingly rare, primary central nervous system lymphoma can present as growing intracerebral hemorrhage due to repeated intratumoral hemorrhages. High expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and the mass effects of hemorrhage could be associated with the onset and growth of intracerebral hemorrhage. Early evaluation and meticulous observation are important to avoid progressive, life-threatening situations in such cases.

DT Review
DE Basilar perforator artery aneurysm; Brainstem AVM; Coils embolization;
   Endovascular; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID TERM-FOLLOW-UP
AB BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)-associated aneurysms are common, reported in 15% of cases. Regarding the ruptured posterior fossa AVMs, associated aneurysms are present in 48% of cases and are the cause of the bleed in 37%. We present a 75-year-old female who presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured aneurysm arising from a flow-related basilar perforator artery feeder of an anterior pontine AVM. We report the successful treatment of the aneurysm with coil embolization.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old female presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage primarily contained within the posterior fossa. Angiography demonstrated a 2 x 3-mm fusiform aneurysm arising from a basilar perforator feeding pedicle of an anterior 1 x 2-cm pontine AVM. Venous drainage from the AVM was predominantly to the superior petrosal vein. Under roadmap guidance, super-selective catheterization of the basilar perforator aneurysm was performed. Three HydroSoft 3D coils were deployed within the aneurysm, resulting in complete obliteration. The patient was discharged on postbleed day 15 to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Follow-up angiography at 5 months demonstrated stable complete obliteration. The patient made a complete recovery and was living independently at the time of this report.
   CONCLUSIONS: Basilar trunk perforator aneurysms are rare lesions, particularly in the setting of brainstem AVMs. We report successful endovascular treatment of a flow-related ruptured basilar perforator aneurysm associated with an anterior pontine AVM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second report addressing this scenario. We hope that the information presented here serves to guide future surgical decision making and management.

TI Primary Focal Intracranial Leptomeningeal Glioma: Case Report and Review
   of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Focal; Glioma; Intracranial; Leptomeningeal; Prognosis
ID MENINGEAL GLIOMA; MIMICKING
AB BACKGROUND: Primary focal intracranial leptomeningeal glioma (PFILG) is considered a rare solitary glial tumor arising from the leptomeninges without brain attachment or evidence of primary neoplasm elsewhere within the neuraxis. We report a case of PFILG in a left parietal location and provide a concise review on its clinicoradiologic, histopathologic, and management characteristics.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old woman presented with focal motor seizures involving the right upper limb with associated occasional headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a small focal lesion attached to the left parietal dura with underlying brain parenchymal signal changes, and contrast-enhanced images showed heterogeneous enhancement of the tumor and meninges. The repeated MRI brain images within a month of primary imaging revealed significant progression of the size of lesion along with invasion of underlying parietal lobe parenchyma. The patient underwent gross total resection of the lesion, and the histopathologic diagnosis was glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), World Health Organization grade 4, isocitrate dehydrogenase wild type. The patient recovered well from surgery without deficits; however, she refused adjuvant treatment. MRI of the brain repeated 3 months after surgery revealed significant progression of the GBM with mass effect. Although adjuvant treatment was then started, she could not tolerate it and died 4 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSION: The possibility of high-grade PFILG should be considered in any aggressive extra-axial focal lesion. The definitive diagnosis can be made after histologic examination. Although surgery followed by adjuvant treatment is considered the mainstay of treatment, the overall prognostic outcome of high-grade PFILG is dismal.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary intracranial leiomyosarcoma is a very rare occurrence, and primary leiomyosarcoma with intratumoral hemorrhage has not been described previously. We present a case of a rapidly enlarging primary intracranial leiomyosarcoma with intratumoral hemorrhage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old female presented with right hemiparesis and gait disturbance. She had a brain tumor on the frontal lobe that was growing rapidly. An intratumoral hemorrhage had occurred suddenly. We removed the tumor after hemorrhage. After the operation, postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy were not performed, but the tumor did not recur.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best our knowledge, this is the first report of primary intracranial leiomyosarcoma with intratumoral hemorrhage.

   base defect
ID TENSION PNEUMOCEPHALUS
AB BACKGROUND: Pneumocephalus is usually seen in trauma or cranial surgery. It is rarely reported as a delayed complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for hydrocephalus secondary to trauma, tumor, or aqueduct stenosis. We describe a case of intraventricular pneumocephalus manifesting 10 months after placement of a shunt for normal-pressure hydrocephalus.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A pressure-regulated ventriculoperitoneal shunt was implanted in an 81-year-old patient after diagnosis of normal-pressure hydrocephalus. He showed postoperative clinical improvement. Routine computed tomography performed 2 months after the procedure showed no abnormalities. He presented 10 months after shunting with a subacute deterioration of gait. Imaging revealed major intraventricular pneumocephalus and a left-sided temporal porencephalic cyst with a small, bony defect in the left petrous bone. A middle fossa approach was performed, and the temporal defect was covered with fascia of the temporal muscle. This resulted in a gradual resolution of pneumocephalus.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pneumocephalus after shunting for NPH is rare and described as a complication only during the first 2 postoperative months. This case is unique, as the pneumocephalus developed 10 months after shunting. The combination of an occult, possibly congenital, skull base defect and the insertion of a shunt resulted in delayed intraventricular and intraparenchymal pneumocephalus.

TI Disappearance of Ruptured Posterior Cerebral Artery Aneurysm Associated

   Artery-to-Middle Cerebral Artery Bypass
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Internal carotid artery occlusion; Posterior cerebral artery aneurysm;
   Cerebrovascular reconstruction; Hemodynamic stress
ID HEMODYNAMICS; CIRCULATION
AB BACKGROUND: Internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion associated with posterior cerebral artery (PCA) aneurysms is regarded as a rare cerebrovascular disease. Common treatment of aneurysms-direct clipping or coiling-is not taken into consideration for this kind of cerebrovascular property. Combined surgical cerebrovascular reconstruction of the superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass offers a chance to downregulate the hemodynamic stress of aneurysm rupture.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old female presented with a fever and headache 1 month ago. An axial computed tomography scan showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was conducted, and the patient received an STA-MCA bypass following medical treatment for 1 month in the local hospital. Computed tomography angiography and DSA demonstrated an aneurysm located on the right PCA and an occlusion of the right ICA in our hospital. Three days after admission, the right STA-MCA bypass was performed. The patient suffered no neurologic deterioration and lived a normal life. 6 months after the STA-MCA bypass, DSA of the right vertebral artery revealed disappearance of the aneurysm located on the right PCA (P2 segment).
   CONCLUSIONS: Owing to ICA occlusion, the gap of hemodynamic stress between the posterior segment of the circle of Willis and anterior segment of the circle of Willis enlarged. This may lead to a ruptured PCA aneurysm. In this case, the aneurysm disappeared following an STA-MCA bypass. STA-MCA bypass may be one of the major reasons downregulating the gap, which can be regarded as an effective option concerning such aneurysms.

ID ROOT
AB BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc herniation is a common degenerative disease of the lumbar spine with a prevalence of 1%-3% in some population studies. In 10% of patients, there is a fragment migrated cranially in Macnab's "hidden zone." In selected cases, this fragment can be removed with a translaminar approach that was described in 1998. We provide a detailed description of the technical advantages and pitfalls of the translaminar approach in a consecutive series of 32 patients treated at our institution.
   METHODS: Patients were divided preoperatively and postoperatively into 5 classes based on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI): class 1, ODI 0%-20% (minimal disability); class 2, 20%-40% (moderate disability); class 3, 40%-60% (severe disability); 60%-80% (crippled); 80%-100% (bedridden or disabling symptoms).
   RESULTS: Four (12.5%) patients were upgraded 1 ODI class after the operation; 6 (18.7%) patients were upgraded 2 classes, 8 (25%) patients were upgraded 3 classes, and 11 (34.4%) patients were upgraded 4 classes. In 3 (9.4%) patients, ODI class did not change after the operation. After surgery, 7 (21.9%) patients developed mild low back pain. Mean follow-up was 25 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: When performed by dedicated spinal neurosurgeons, the translaminar approach is safe and effective in patients with long-term follow-up. Most patients showed an improvement in ODI. Major pitfalls were related to surgical selection and the narrow working space.

AB Metastatic vertebral compression fractures pose a significant clinical problem to cancer patients including pain, spinal deformity, and neurologic deficit. Treatment of metastases to the spine is complex and challenging and may require local and systemic therapies. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was adopted to treat spinal metastases since its introduction during the late 1980s. The main indications for PVP in the treatment of spinal metastases are analgesia and spinal stabilization. Complications of PVP in malignant compression fractures are more common than in nonmalignant ones. We present 1 case of tumor seeding along the needle tract of a breast cancer patient who had undergone PVP.

AB BACKGROUND: Owing to its unique advantages, 2-level artificial cervical disc replacement (ACDR) is gaining attention. Among artificial discs designed for use in ACDR, the Food and Drug Administration-approved Prestige-LP Cervical Disc is widely used. There are no standard implantation sequences for 2-level ACDR using the Prestige-LP disc, and complications resulting from inappropriate implantation sequences remain unknown.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman underwent continuous 2-level ACDR using the Prestige-LP disc and experienced anterior migration of a previously inserted artificial disc after secondary disc implantation at an upper segment owing to an inappropriate implantation sequence during surgery. Intraoperative radiographs showed stable index levels and artificial discs. We tapped the migrated disc back into its correct position and recommended a postoperative functional exercise plan to the patient. We followed the patient for 8 years to verify the safety of our solution. We developed an implantation strategy for 2-level ACDR to avoid this complication in the future.
   CONCLUSIONS: During 2-level ACDR, a top-down sequence should be used to implant prostheses. When anterior disc migration occurs, intraoperative radiographs should be obtained to ensure stability of the index levels. If there is no instability, the migrated tab can be tapped back into its correct position. In addition, limiting motion rather than allowing intermittent movement of the neck for at least 3 months is important to promote union between bone and prosthesis.

ID CRYPTOGENIC BRAIN-ABSCESS; PATENT FORAMEN OVALE; ATRIAL SEPTAL-DEFECT
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral abscesses are rare, potentially life-threatening entities that result from local spread or hematogenous dissemination to the brain. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment is key in lowering morbidity and preventing mortality associated with cerebral abscesses. Congenital heart diseases with right-to-left intracardiac shunts can be complicated by brain abscesses via paradoxical embolism of infected microthrombi. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by an underdeveloped left heart that uses intracardiac shunting to achieve adequate systemic circulation. We present the first reported case of a cerebral abscess in a patient with HLHS. The pathophysiology of HLHS and how it predisposes patients to development of cerebral abscesses is discussed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 25-year-old male was transferred to our institution complaining of headache, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was not an intravenous (IV) drug user, and serologic testing was negative for human immunodeficiency virus. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 2.6-cm left occipital abscess, which was surgically resected without complication, and the patient was treated with IV antibiotics.
   CONCLUSION: HLHS is a rare congenital cardiac malformation. The long-term outcome of patients with this condition continues to improve as treatment paradigms evolve. As such, patients with HLHS are living longer, and their potential to develop cerebral abscesses secondary to their unique systemic circulation is increasing with improved life expectancy. Surgeons and physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for cerebral abscess in the setting of HLHS.

AB BACKGROUND: Inflow into an aneurysm sac immediately following flow diverter (FD) treatment is an assumed cause of delayed aneurysmal rupture. The significance of delayed posttreatment residual flow occurring months after FD treatment is unknown.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 76-year-old woman with a large intracranial aneurysm measuring 23.0 x 18.1 mm in the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery was treated with placement of a single FD (Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). Postprocedure digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated flow stagnation inside the aneurysm dome. The patient was discharged 9 days post procedure without new neurologic deficits. A 6-month follow-up DSA demonstrated delayed posttreatment residual flow into the aneurysm sac. Although she was scheduled for additional FD placement because of concern for aneurysmal rupture, the operation was not conducted due to an interim motor vehicle accident. Oral treatment with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was continued during her recovery. DSA performed 12 months post procedure showed that the aneurysm had completely thrombosed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm may form part of the normal clinical course post FD placement and may not preclude eventual thrombosis of the aneurysm. Larger studies are needed to determine whether more frequent follow-up DSAs after FD placement are necessary and whether all patients exhibiting delayed posttreatment residual flow into an aneurysm require additional FD placement or if watchful waiting is a more suitable course.

   LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; 10-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA; ANEURYSM
AB BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established modality for treatment of vestibular schwannomas (VSs). However, its long-term vascular complications have not been well studied. Among 360 patients who underwent SRS for VS in our institution and lived for >5 years thereafter, we identified only 1 patient who exhibited a complication secondary to a late-onset aneurysm for an estimated incidence of 0.3%.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old man who had undergone SRS 19 years previously for a right VS presented with right peripheral facial palsy. Radiographic examinations revealed a distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) fusiform aneurysm that was embedded in the tumor and progressively enlarged over 17 months. Although the right AICA perfused a large area of the cerebellum, the aneurysm was successfully treated with AICA trapping in conjunction with an occipital artery-AICA bypass.
   CONCLUSIONS: Distal AICA pseudoaneurysm formation is a rare but potentially severe late complication after SRS for VS. This pathology was successfully treated with AICA trapping with occipital artery-AICA bypass.

DE Embolization; Foreign body embolization; Middle cerebral artery
ID MIGRATED COIL; RETRIEVAL; SNARE
AB BACKGROUND: Embolic strokes mainly result from cardiac or vascular origins, but there are instances when they can arise from iatrogenic foreign bodies. Catheter coatings or retained microcatheters are mainly implicated in foreign body embolism following neuroendovascular intervention. However, there are no known descriptions for free-floating and/or dislodged microcatheter fragments in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the clinical details, imaging findings, and management of a 69-year-old woman who underwent elective pipeline embolization of an incidental right paraophthalmic artery aneurysm and suffered distal embolization of the radiopaque marker from a distal guide catheter (088 Neuron Max, Penumbra, Alameda, California, USA) used during neuroendovascular intervention. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of distal embolism from an unprovoked fracture of a neurointerventional catheter.
   CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of several salvage techniques is essential in preventing major cerebrovascular complications. It is imperative that a multi-level approach should be taken when treating foreign body embolism.

ID ABSCESSES SECONDARY
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial dermoid cysts are benign embryologic tumors. They occur most often in children and young adults. Infected intradural dermoid cyst with complete dermal sinus of posterior fossa is rare. The main feature of this dermal sinus is the continuity from the intradural cyst through the occipital bone to the skin.
   METHODS: We report 2 cases of infected intradural dermoid cyst with complete dermal sinus of posterior fossa in children, with special attention to the clinical and anatomical features of this rare combination of anomalies.
   RESULTS: A 5-year-old boy presented with a midline cystic lesion responsible for triventricular hydrocephalus revealed by a cerebellar syndrome and a dermal sinus. The second case was a 36-month-old girl who had an occipital cystic lesion that was limited by a pseudo-wall with diffusion restriction revealed by a double dermal sinus. We inserted an external shunt to relieve the increased intracranial pressure then performed a suboccipital approach for excision followed by systemic antibiotic therapy. Both cases had satisfactory outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Infected intradural dermoid cyst with complete dermal sinus of posterior fossa is rare, and a double dermal sinus has not yet published, to our knowledge.

ID POSTERIOR COMMUNICATING ARTERY
AB BACKGROUND: Using angled fenestrated clips for posteromedially projecting internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms may allow the surgeon to simultaneously obliterate the aneurysmal neck and preserve the branching artery by applying the blade of the clip parallel to the ICA. However, using these clips when the aneurysm neck involves the branching artery may have a risk of branching artery stenosis, occlusion, or incomplete obliteration of the aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old woman developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography showed a saccular aneurysm arising from the left ICA-posterior communicating artery (PCoA) bifurcation. The aneurysmal fundus projected posteromedially, and the PCoA was larger than the ipsilateral P1 segment, in which its origin involved the aneurysmal neck. Tandem straight fenestrated clips were applied across the ICA, followed by reconstruction of the ICA wall with preservation of the PCoA and obliteration of the aneurysm.
   CONCLUSION: When using angled fenestrated clips is unsuitable because of a risk of branching artery stenosis, occlusion, or incomplete obliteration of the aneurysm, using multiple straight fenestrated clips may be a useful alternative.

AB BACKGROUND: Kummell disease has been treated with multiple surgical approaches, as described in the literature. However, there are few reports describing the technique of transpedicular intrabody cage insertion to enhance bony fusion and maintain the height of the vertebral body. We describe the technique of transpedicular intrabody cage insertion with posterolateral fusion in patients with Kummell disease.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two patients diagnosed as having Kummell disease were treated with transpedicular intrabody cage insertion with allogenic bone graft and posterolateral fusion with pedicle screw insertion. Both patients were followed up routinely at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, and clinical evaluations and radiography were performed. Patients 1 and 2 visited our center 8 months and 33 months, respectively. After surgery, we obtained additional radiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative computed tomography was performed at 3 months. The visual analog scale score for pain and the Cobb angle were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. The operation was completed in both patients without any complications. Immediate postoperative radiographs showed the intrabody cage with corrected kyphosis. Postoperative computed tomography scans at 3 months and radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging at 8 months (patient 1) and 33 months (patient 2) showed bone formation of the vertebral body involved with Kummell disease and maintenance of the vertebral body height in both patients. Back pain was significantly improved in both patients.
   CONCLUSION: Transpedicular intrabody cage insertion is a safe and effective procedure for treating vertebral osteonecrosis to achieve bone formation at the site of vertebral osteonecrosis and to maintain body height.

ID OF-THE-LITERATURE; NECK PARAGANGLIOMAS; NONCHROMAFFIN PARAGANGLIOMA;
   GLOMUS TUMOR; HEAD
AB BACKGROUND: Paragangliomas of the head and neck region are not only rare but also unique in that they are derived from the parasympathetic system and are nonsecretory. Orbit represents 1 of the least common sites for head and neck paragangliomas. Orbital paraganglioma remains predominantly a disease of adults, and it has never been reported in infancy earlier. Therefore it is not known if these tumors in infancy behave any differently than their adult counterparts.
   CASE REPORT: A 1-year-old boy presented with left-sided proptosis and restricted ocular movement for 3 months. On examination, the proptosis was nonaxial and nonreducible and the child could follow objects with the left eye with normal pupillary reactions bilaterally. On neuroimaging, a rounded enhancing mass was seen in the superomedial aspect of the left retrobulbar space closely abutting the optic nerve. The tumor was subtotally excised using a left fron-to-orbital approach, leaving some tumor on the optic nerve. It was decided to closely observe the residual tumor in the follow-up period; however, the child developed recurrence with visual loss after 6 months of surgery.
   CONCLUSION: Orbital paraganglioma in infancy may be more aggressive than the adult counterparts. Although simple excision without adjuvant radiation may be tried in localized tumors with intact vision, recurrence tends to be high. Orbital exenteration with or without radiotherapy remains the only salvage option in such recurrences.

ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; SPONTANEOUS DISSECTION; VEIN
AB BACKGROUND: Unruptured extracranial vertebral artery (VA) aneurysms are uncommon and have rarely been described with treatment options. Here we report the successful reconstruction of an asymptomatic extracranial left VA aneurysm, highlighting the treatment for extracranial VA aneurysm and showing the superiority of a hybrid operating room in cerebral vascular diseases. CASE
   DESCRIPTION: In this 57-year-old female who had sustained an extracranial left VA aneurysm, magnetic resonance angiography showed bilateral VAs as codominant in the vertebrobasilar system. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated that the fusiform aneurysm (18.7 x 15.4 mm) was present at the proximal part of the left VA. Aneurysm resection and vascular graft reconstruction were performed in the hybrid operating room. A successful outcome was noted at the 6-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Extracranial VA aneurysm in the V1 segment can be well treated with open surgery using a prosthetic graft. Preserving the function of the affected VA should always be a point of concern.

   Leucotomy; Noninvasive presurgical; One-stage epilepsy surgery
ID SURGERY; OUTCOMES; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Catastrophic epilepsy results in severe neurodevelopmental delay in infants because of frequent and/or long seizures. Therefore, consideration of early epilepsy surgery is essential for neurodevelopmental outcome. Once an infant with catastrophic seizures is identified as a surgical candidate, it is important that the surgical plan be carefully defined based on detailed pre-surgical evidence to minimize surgical complications in this age group.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present 2 infants with catastrophic epilepsy, epileptic spasms, and bihemispheric electroencephalographic abnormalities who underwent one-stage disconnection surgery based on a sound hypothesis of the epileptogenic zone. Each patient underwent an extensive noninvasive presurgical investigation followed by stereotactic disconnection leucotomy in a single stage. After the 2 children were followed for 24-36 months. A seizure reduction by at least 90% (Engel class I) was achieved in both cases with subsequent improvement in neurodevelopmental progress. There were no peri-operative complications. Both patients had widespread cortical dysplasia on pathologic evaluation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration of the noninvasive presurgical workup can identify focal onset even in the presence of catastrophic epilepsy with widespread bilateral abnormalities. Single-stage lobar leucotomy for disconnection of the epileptogenic zone can lead to excellent outcome in these patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Overshunting-associated myelopathy (OSAM) is a very rare complication of ventricular shunt therapy, and only 11 previous cases have been reported in the literature. We report the successful surgical management of a case of OSAM in a patient with bilateral jugular vein occlusion and congenital hydrocephalus.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old patient with shunt-dependent, congenital hydrocephalus presented to our department with an 8-year history of progressive tetraparesis and gait disturbance. The patient was wheelchair-dependent. A new magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head revealed slit ventricle syndrome and dural enhancement due to shunt overdrainage. Magnetic resonance imaging and a computed tomography-phlebography of the cervical spine revealed engorgement of the epidural venous plexus with secondary compression of the spinal cord and myelomalacia. Surgery was performed, during which we implanted a shunt valve. The patient recovered from surgery without any new deficits. The tetraparesis improved during the inpatient hospital stay. Computed tomography-phlebography was performed 5 days after surgery and showed that the epidural venous plexus anterior to the cervical spinal cord had returned to nearly normal size. On follow-up examination 3 months after surgery, the patient's strength had improved, and he was able to walk short distances with assistance and with ankle foot orthosis on the right side.
   CONCLUSIONS: OSAM has to be considered according to the Monro-Kellie doctrine and is affected by an engorgement of the epidural cervical venous plexus, which can produce cervical myelopathy. Because it can be treated simply by increasing the shunt resistance, surgeons should be aware of the rarely detected overdrainage complication.

   tumor; PNET; Wound site seeding
ID DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Advances in molecular profiling have facilitated the emergence of newly defined entities of central nervous system (CNS) tumor, including CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration (CNS HGNET-BCOR). Relatively little is known about the clinical behavior of these newly characterized tumors.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a pediatric male patient with CNS HGNET-BCOR, who developed seeding of the tumor into the site of the surgical wound within months of surgery and who underwent resection of a residual posterior fossa tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes 3 important points. First, CNS HGNET-BCOR can be aggressive tumors that necessitate close clinical and radiologic surveillance. Second, surveillance imaging in such cases should incorporate the surgical incision site into the field of view, and this should be closely scrutinized to ensure the timely detection of wound site seeding. Third, wound site seeding may still occur despite the use of meticulous surgical techniques.

TI The Barrow Innovation Center Case Series: Early Clinical Experience with
   Novel, Low-Cost Techniques for Bone Graft Containment in the
   Posterolateral Fusion Bed
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bone graft containment; Cost; Posterolateral fusion; Resident education;
   Surgical innovation
AB BACKGROUND: A frequently encountered problem during posterolateral fusion (PLF) is bone graft displacement from the posterolateral space during closure. Commercially available solutions to this problem are seldom used because of their exceptionally high cost. The purpose of this report is to describe 3 novel, low-cost techniques we developed for bone graft containment during PLF.
   METHODS: Three low-cost bone graft containment techniques are described: rapid suture weave, makeshift bone bag, and cellulose rooftop. Early clinical experience with these techniques is reported for a 5-patient case series.
   RESULTS: One or more of these bone graft containment techniques were used in 5 patients who underwent PLF. Rapid suture weave was the least expensive (<$5.00) but required the longest additional time to perform (20 minutes). Makeshift bone bag and cellulose rooftop cost approximately the same ($48.00 and $46.00, respectively); the makeshift bone bag took less additional time (3 minutes) but created a potential barrier between the bone graft and the host site, whereas the cellulose rooftop took slightly longer to perform (5 minutes) but permitted direct contact between the bone graft and host site.
   CONCLUSIONS: These 3 novel surgical techniques for bone graft containment in the posterolateral space add minimally to the cost and length of the procedure. Our early clinical experience suggests that these techniques are safe and effective. Additional clinical experience is warranted, and prospective data collection is ongoing.

   Embolization
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Editorial Material
DE Complete occlusion; Single-stage transarterial venous sac embolization;
   Transarterial multistage embolization; Vein of Galen malformations
AB Advances in endovascular embolization have improved morbidity and mortality among patients with vein of Galen malformations (VoGMs). The patient presented at 3 months of age with increased head circumference and a bruit over his anterior fontanelle. Diagnostic cerebral angiography confirmed the presence of a large mural-type VoGM. The decision was made to undergo a staged arterial embolization at 4 years of age after developing worsening right-sided hemiparesis. An attempt was made to occlude the posterior choroidal feeding vessel with a large 25 mm x 50 cm coil, followed by a 6 mm x 20 cm coil; however, the high flow of the lesion displaced both coils into the wall of the aneurysmal venous sac. Interval magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed partial occlusion of the VoGM at 7 months and complete thrombosis at 24 months post procedure, precluding a need for additional coiling. This case illustrates that a minimal change in intramural flow dynamics of VoGMs could lead to progressive thrombosis.
