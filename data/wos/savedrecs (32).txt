AB We introduce an efficient algorithm, called partition of unity extension or PUX, to construct an extension of desired regularity of a function given on a complex multiply connected domain in 2D. Function extension plays a fundamental role in extending the applicability of boundary integral methods to inhomogeneous partial differential equations with embedded domain techniques. Overlapping partitions are placed along the boundaries, and a local extension of the function is computed on each patch using smooth radial basis functions; a trivially parallel process. A partition of unity method blends the local extrapolations into a global one, where weight functions impose compact support. The regularity of the extended function can be controlled by the construction of the partition of unity function. We evaluate the performance of the PUX method in the context of solving the Poisson equation on multiply connected domains using a boundary integral method and a spectral solver. With a suitable choice of parameters the error converges as a tenth order method down to 10(-14). (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Uncertainty Quantification through stochastic spectral methods is rising in popularity. We derive a modification of the classical stochastic Galerkin method, that ensures the hyper-bolicity of the underlying hyperbolic system of partial differential equations. The modification is done using a suitable "slope" limiter, based on similar ideas in the context of kinetic moment models. We apply the resulting modified stochastic Galerkin method to the compressible Euler equations and the M-1 model of radiative transfer. Our numerical results show that it can compete with other UQ methods like the intrusive polynomial moment method while being computationally inexpensive and easy to implement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, we develop a time stepping scheme for solving nonlinear time-space fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). In space, we use the matrix transfer technique to discretize the PDEs and obtain a system of nonlinear time-fractional differential equations. The developed scheme is similar to the Crank-Nicholson scheme for integer order PDEs and are shown to be of order 1 + alpha in time where a is the order of the time derivative described in the Caputo sense. The solution of the PDE at any point i in the t-stencil depends not only on the solution at the point i - 1 but on all previous solutions (memory effect). Thus, the implementation of schemes for such fractional PDEs, for long time interval, can be time consuming. This is basically due to the computation and re-computation of the history term at each time step. We lessen this computational time by implementing three parallel versions of the algorithm. The shared memory systems (OpenMP) and the distributed memory systems (MPI) are used for implementing the parallel algorithms. A third parallel version uses both the shared and distributed memory systems (Hybrid version). The advantages of the parallel algorithms over the sequential algorithm are discussed. The merits and demerits of each parallel versions of the algorithm over the others are examined. Numerical simulations are performed to support our theoretical observations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The generation of high-quality staggered unstructured grids is considered, leading to the development of a new optimisation-based strategy designed to construct weighted 'Regular-Power' tessellations appropriate for co-volume type numerical discretisation techniques. This new framework aims to extend the conventional Delaunay-Voronoi primal-dual structure; seeking to assemble generalised orthogonal tessellations with enhanced geometric quality. The construction of these grids is motivated by the desire to improve the performance and accuracy of numerical methods based on unstructured co-volume type schemes, including various staggered grid techniques for the simulation of fluid dynamics and hyperbolic transport. In this study, a new hybrid optimisation strategy is proposed; seeking to optimise the geometry, topology and weights associated with general, two-dimensional Regular-Power tessellations using a combination of gradient-ascent and energy-based techniques. The performance of this new method is tested experimentally, with a range of complex, multi-resolution primal-dual grids generated for various coastal and regional ocean modelling applications.

AB Momentum-weighted interpolation (MWI) is a widely used discretisation method to prevent pressure-velocity decoupling in simulations of incompressible and low Mach number flows on meshes with a collocated variable arrangement. Despite its popularity, a unified and consistent formulation of the MWI is not available at present. In this work, a discretisation procedure is devised following an in-depth analysis of the individual terms of the MWI, derived from physically consistent arguments, based on which a unified formulation of the MWI for flows on structured and unstructured meshes is proposed, including extensions for discontinuous source terms in the momentum equations as well as discontinuous changes of density. As shown by the presented analysis and numerical results, the MWI enforces a low-pass filter on the pressure field, which suppresses oscillatory solutions. Furthermore, the numerical dissipation of kinetic energy introduced by the MWI is shown to converge with third order in space and is independent of the time-step, if the MWI is derived consistently from the momentum equations. In the presence of source terms, the low-pass filter on the pressure field can be shaped by a careful choice of the interpolation coefficients to ensure the filter only acts on the driving pressure gradient that is associated with the fluid motion, which is shown to be vitally important for the accuracy of the numerical solution. To this end, a force-balanced discretisation of the source terms is proposed, that precisely matches the discretisation of the pressure gradients and preserves the force applied to the flow. Using representative test cases of incompressible and low Mach number flows, including flows with discontinuous source terms and two-phase flows with large density ratios, the newly proposed formulation of the MWI is favourably compared against existing formulations and is shown to significantly reduce, or even eliminate, solution errors, with an increased stability for flows with large density ratios.

AB A new mesh generation process for wind farm modeling is presented together with a mesh convergence and sizing analysis for wind farm flow simulations. The generated meshes are tailored to simulate Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flows on complex terrains modeling the wind turbines as actuator discs. The wind farm mesher is fully automatic and, given the topography and the turbine characteristics (location, diameter and hub height), it generates a hybrid mesh conformal with the actuator discs and refined upwind and downstream. Moreover, it presents smooth element size transitions across scales and avoids extending high-resolution areas to all the domain. We take advantage of our automatic and robust mesher to study the mesh convergence of our RANS solver with linear elements, obtaining quadratic mesh convergence for a quantity of interest in all the tested cases. In addition, we quantify the mesh resolution at the terrain surface and at the actuator discs required to achieve a given numerical error in simulations in onshore and offshore frameworks. Finally, we present the generated meshes and the simulation results for an offshore and an onshore wind farm. We analyze in detail one particular wind direction for both cases, and for the onshore wind farm we use our automatic framework to estimate the yearly production of energy and measuring the error against the actual produced one.

AB In a previous article [J. Comp. Phys. 357 (2018) 282-304] [4], the mixed mimetic spectral element method was used to solve the rotating shallow water equations in an idealized geometry. Here the method is extended to a smoothly varying, non-affine, cubed sphere geometry. The differential operators are encoded topologically via incidence matrices due to the use of spectral element edge functions to construct tensor product solution spaces in H(rot), H(div) and L-2. These incidence matrices commute with respect to the metric terms in order to ensure that the mimetic properties are preserved independent of the geometry. This ensures conservation of mass, vorticity and energy for the rotating shallow water equations using inexact quadrature on the cubed sphere. The spectral convergence of errors are similarly preserved on the cubed sphere, with the generalized Piola transformation used to construct the metric terms for the physical field quantities.

AB In reservoir simulation, solution of the coupled systems of nonlinear algebraic equations that are associated with fully-implicit (backward Euler) discretization is challenging. Having a robust and efficient nonlinear solver is necessary in order for reservoir simulation to serve as the primary tool for managing the recovery processes of large-scale reservoirs. However, there are several outstanding challenges that are intimately connected to the highly nonlinear nature of the problem. Given a set of sources and sinks, the variation in the total velocity can span many orders of magnitude due to extreme contrasts in the permeability field in large-scale subsurface porous formations. Moreover, multiple and complex saturation fronts must be properly resolved throughout the three-dimensional reservoir model of interest. Add to that numerical simulation studies entail making field-scale predictions over many decades, and the challenge of developing robust and efficient nonlinear solvers across a very wide parameter space becomes clear. Here, we develop a continuation method based on the use of a dissipation operator. We focus on nonlinear two-phase flow and transport in heterogeneous formations in the presence of viscous, gravitational, and capillary forces. The homotopy is constructed by adding numerical dissipation to the coupled discrete conservation equations. A continuation parameter is introduced to control the amount of dissipation. Numerical evidence of multi-dimensional models and detailed analysis of single-cell problems are used to explain how the dissipation operator improves the nonlinear convergence of the coupled system of equations. An adaptive strategy to determine the dissipation coefficient is proposed. The dissipation level is computed locally for each cell interface. We demonstrate the efficiency of the dissipation-based continuation (DBC) nonlinear solver using several examples, including 1D scalar transport and 2D heterogeneous problems with fully-coupled flow and transport. The DBC solver has better convergence properties compared with the standard damped-Newton solvers used in reservoir simulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MIXED FINITE-ELEMENTS; POROUS-MEDIA; NEWTON; ALGORITHM
AB We present an approximate Jacobian approach for solving nonlinear, multiphase flow and transport problems in porous media. A backward Euler time discretization scheme is used prior to spatial discretization with a lowest order mixed finite element method (MFEM). This results in a fully implicit nonlinear algebraic system of equations. Conventionally, an exact Jacobian construction is employed during the Newton linearization to obtain a linear system of equations after spatial and temporal discretization. This fully coupled, monolithic linear system, usually in pressure and saturation (or concentration) unknowns, requires specialized preconditioners such as constrained pressure residual (CPR) or two stage preconditioner. These preconditioners operate on the linear system to decouple pressure and saturation (or concentration) degrees of freedom (DOF) in order to use existing linear solvers for positive definite (PD) matrices such as GMRES or AMG, to name a few. In this work, we present an alternative to two-stage preconditioning (or CPR) for solving the aforementioned monolithic system after Newton linearization. This approach relies upon a decoupling approximation for the pressure-saturation (or concentration) block submatrices, during Newton linearization, to obtain block diagonal sub-matrices. The resulting linear system is easily reduced, trivially eliminating these diagonal sub-matrices, to obtain a system in pressure DOF circumventing the need for specialized preconditioners. Further, the linear system has lesser DOF owing to the elimination of saturation (or concentration) unknowns. This nonlinear solver is demonstrated to be as accurate as the exact Jacobian approach, measured in terms of convergence of nonlinear residual to a desired tolerance for both methods. Our numerical results indicate a consistent computational speedup by a factor of approximately 1.32 to 4.0 for the two-phase flow model formulation under consideration. This is related to the DOF of the linear systems for the approximate and exact Jacobian approaches. For multicomponent flow and transport, this speedup is expected to be directly proportional to the number of concentration degrees of freedom. A number of field scale numerical simulations are also presented to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for realistic problems. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB As computing power rapidly increases, quickly creating a representative and accurate discretization of complex geometries arises as a major hurdle towards achieving a next generation simulation capability. Component definitions may be in the form of solid (CAD) models or derived from 3D computed tomography (CT) data, and creating a surface-conformal discretization may be required to resolve complex interfacial physics. The Conformal Decomposition Finite Element Methods (CDFEM) has been shown to be an efficient algorithm for creating conformal tetrahedral discretizations of these implicit geometries without manual mesh generation.
   In this work we describe an extension to CDFEM to accurately resolve the intersections of many materials within a simulation domain. This capability is demonstrated on both an analytical geometry and an image-based CT mesostructure representation consisting of hundreds of individual particles. Effective geometric and transport properties are the calculated quantities of interest. Solution verification is performed, showing CDFEM to be optimally convergent in nearly all cases. Representative volume element (RVE) size is also explored and per-sample variability quantified. Relatively large domains and small elements are required to reduce uncertainty, with recommended meshes of nearly 10 million elements still containing upwards of 30% uncertainty in certain effective properties. This work instills confidence in the applicability of CDFEM to provide insight into the behaviors of complex composite materials and provides recommendations on domain and mesh requirements.

AB We present a systematic study of the nested sampling algorithm based on the example of the Potts model. This model, which exhibits a first order phase transition for q > 4, exemplifies a generic numerical challenge in statistical physics: The evaluation of the partition function and thermodynamic observables, which involve high dimensional sums of sharply structured multi-modal density functions. It poses a major challenge to most standard numerical techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. In this paper we will demonstrate that nested sampling is particularly suited for such problems and it has a couple of advantages. For calculating the partition function of the Potts model with N sites: a) one run stops after O(N) moves, so it takes O(N-2) operations for the run, b) only a single run is required to compute the partition function along with the assignment of confidence intervals, c) the confidence intervals of the logarithmic partition function decrease with 1/root N and d) a single run allows to compute quantities for all temperatures while the autocorrelation time is very small, irrespective of temperature. Thermodynamic expectation values of observables, which are completely determined by the bond configuration in the representation of Fortuin and Kasteleyn, like the Helmholtz free energy, the internal energy as well as the entropy and heat capacity, can be calculated in the same single run needed for the partition function along with their confidence intervals. In contrast, thermodynamic expectation values of magnetic properties like the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility require sampling the additional spin degree of freedom. Results and performance are studied in detail and compared with those obtained with multi-canonical sampling. Eventually the implications of the findings on a parallel implementation of nested sampling are outlined. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The spectral element method (SEM) is a mimetic finite element method with several properties that make it a desirable choice for numerical modeling. Although the linear dispersion properties of this method have been analyzed extensively for the case of the 1D inviscid advection equation, practical implementations of the SEM frequently employ hyperdiffusion for stabilization. As argued in this paper, hyperdiffusion has a pronounced impact on the accuracy of the discrete wave modes and the dispersive properties of the SEM. When applied with an appropriately large coefficient, hyperdiffusion is effective at removing the spectral gap and improving the stability of the 1D advection equation. This study also considers the SEM as applied to the 2D linearized shallow-water equations, where hyperdiffusion in the form of scalar diffusion, divergence damping, and vorticity damping are analyzed. To the extent possible, guidance on the choice of hyperdiffusion coefficients is provided. A brief discussion of the comparative impact of local element filtering is included. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We extend the entropy stable high order nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element approximation for the non-linear two dimensional shallow water equations presented by Wintermeyer et al. (2017) [46] with a shock capturing technique and a positivity preservation capability to handle dry areas. The scheme preserves the entropy inequality, is well-balanced and works on unstructured, possibly curved, quadrilateral meshes. For the shock capturing, we introduce an artificial viscosity to the equations and prove that the numerical scheme remains entropy stable. We add a positivity preserving limiter to guarantee non-negative water heights as long as the mean water height is non-negative. We prove that non-negative mean water heights are guaranteed under a certain additional time step restriction for the entropy stable numerical interface flux. We implement the method on GPU architectures using the abstract language OCCA, a unified approach to multi-threading languages. We show that the entropy stable scheme is well suited to GPUs as the necessary extra calculations do not negatively impact the runtime up to reasonably high polynomial degrees (around N = 7). We provide numerical examples that challenge the shock capturing and positivity properties of our scheme to verify our theoretical findings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Selective Frequency Damping (SFD) is a popular method for the computation of globally unstable steady-state solutions in fluid dynamics. The approach has two model parameters whose selection is generally unclear. In this article, a detailed analysis of the influence of these parameters is presented, answering several open questions with regard to the effectiveness, optimum efficiency and limitations of the method. In particular, we show that SFD is always capable of stabilising a globally unstable systems ruled by one unsteady unstable eigenmode and derive analytical formulas for optimum parameter values. We show that the numerical feasibility of the approach depends on the complex phase angle of the most unstable eigenvalue. A numerical technique for characterising the pertinent eigenmodes is presented. In combination with analytical expressions, this technique allows finding optimal parameters that minimise the spectral radius of a simulation, without having to perform an independent stability analysis. An extension to multiple unstable eigenmodes is derived. As computational example, a two-dimensional cylinder flow case is optimally stabilised using this method. We provide a physical interpretation of the stabilisation mechanism based on, but not limited to, this Navier-Stokes example. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Their examples include the Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations. We develop new parallel algorithms to solve such high-dimensional PDEs. The algorithms are based on canonical and hierarchical numerical tensor methods combined with alternating least squares and hierarchical singular value decomposition. Both implicit and explicit integration schemes are presented and discussed. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed new algorithms in computing the numerical solution to both an advection equation in six variables plus time and a linearized version of the Boltzmann equation.

AB In the context of numerical solution of PDEs, dynamic mesh redistribution methods (r-adaptive methods) are an important procedure for increasing the resolution in regions of interest, without modifying the connectivity of the mesh. Key to the success of these methods is that the mesh should be sufficiently refined (locally) and flexible in order to resolve evolving solution features, but at the same time not introduce errors through skewness and lack of regularity. Some state-of-the-art methods are bottom-up in that they attempt to prescribe both the local cell size and the alignment to features of the solution. However, the resulting problem is overdetermined, necessitating a compromise between these conflicting requirements. An alternative approach, described in this paper, is to prescribe only the local cell size and augment this an optimal transport condition to provide global regularity. This leads to a robust and flexible algorithm for generating meshes fitted to an evolving solution, with minimal need for tuning parameters. Of particular interest for geophysical modelling are meshes constructed on the surface of the sphere. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that meshes generated on the sphere using this optimal transport approach have good a-priori regularity and that the meshes produced are naturally aligned to various simple features. It is further shown that the sphere's intrinsic curvature leads to more regular meshes than the plane. In addition to these general results, we provide a wide range of examples relevant to practical applications, to showcase the behaviour of optimally transported meshes on the sphere. These range from axisymmetric cases that can be solved analytically to more general examples that are tackled numerically. Evaluation of the singular values and singular vectors of the mesh transformation provides a quantitative measure of the mesh anisotropy, and this is shown to match analytic predictions.

AB This paper presents a novel framework for hp-adaptation of high-order discontinuous finite element discretizations for compressible flow simulation. Using the sensitivities of an adjoint-based error estimate, our method seeks element size, shape, and polynomial degree distributions which minimize an adjoint-based error estimate for a specified number of degrees of freedom. This approach results in an optimized hp-mesh tailored to yield the most accurate prediction of an output quantity of interest, such as aerodynamic coefficients, at a given computational cost. The proposed approach features a reduced dependence on user-defined parameters compared to established fixed-fraction adjoint-based adaptive methods. It provides a unifying framework where adaptation decisions such as isotropic/anisotropic, h-/p-refinement/coarsening do not only rely on local arbitrary measures of solution anisotropy and smoothness, but rather where a globally optimal distribution of degrees of freedom is sought to minimize the error in the chosen quantity of interest.

AB In this paper, we consider numerical methods for solving the two-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equation in the finite Larmor radius approximation regime. The model describes the behaviour of charged particles under a strong external magnetic field and the finite Larmor radius scaling. We discretise the equation under Particle-in-Cell method, where the characteristics equations are highly oscillatory system in the limit regime. We apply popular numerical integrators including splitting methods, multi-revolution composition methods, two-scale formulation method and limit solver to integrate the characteristics. We then highlight the strengths and drawbacks of each method. Finally, numerical experiments are presented, and comparisons on the accuracy, efficiency and long-time behaviour of the methods are made, pointing to the method with the best performance for this problem.

AB A compositional formulation is a reliable option for understanding the complex subsurface processes and the associated physical changes. However, this type of model has a great computational cost, since the number of equations that needs to be solved in each grid block increases proportionally with the number of components employed. To address this issue, we herewith propose a multiscale reconstruction in physics for compositional simulation. The ideology consists of two stages, wherein two different sets of restriction and prolongation operators are defined based on the dynamics of compositional transport. In the first stage, an operator restricting the arbitrary number of components to only two equations for flow and transport is implemented with the objective of accurately reconstructing the multiphase boundaries in space. The prediction of multiphase front propagation is the most critical aspect of the approach, as they involve a lot of uncertainties. Once the position of two-phase boundaries is identified, the full conservative solution in the single-phase region can be accurately reconstructed based on the prolongation interpolation operator. Subsequently, in the second stage, the solution for the multicomponent problem (full system) in the two-phase region is reconstructed by solving just two transport equations with the aid of restriction operator defined based on an invariant thermodynamic path. The proposed reconstruction strategy results in coarsening of the compositional problem in terms of the physical representation (number of equations), thereby appreciably reducing the simulation time by several folds without significant loss in the accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed multiscale strategy for several challenging gas injection problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Numerical and analytical methods are developed for the investigation of contact sets in electrostatic-elastic deflections modeling micro-electro mechanical systems. The model for the membrane deflection is a fourth-order semi-linear partial differential equation and the contact events occur in this system as finite time singularities. Primary research interest is in the dependence of the contact set on model parameters and the geometry of the domain. An adaptive numerical strategy is developed based on a moving mesh partial differential equation to dynamically relocate a fixed number of mesh points to increase density where the solution has fine scale detail, particularly in the vicinity of forming singularities. To complement this computational tool, a singular perturbation analysis is used to develop a geometric theory for predicting the possible contact sets. The validity of these two approaches are demonstrated with a variety of test cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a variation of the method of regularized Stokeslet (MRS) specialized for the case of forces and torques distributed over filaments in three dimensions. The new formulation is based on the exact solution of Stokes equation generated by a linear continuous distribution of regularized forces along a line segment. Therefore, a straight filament with linearly varying forces does not require discretization. A general filament is approximated by a piecewise linear curve in three dimensions where the length of each line segment is chosen only based on the variation of the force field and the desired accuracy of its piecewise linear approximation. The most significant advantage of this formulation is that the values of the regularization parameter epsilon and the length of the segments h are decoupled as long as epsilon < h so that epsilon can be selected as a proxy for the radius of the filament and h is chosen to discretize the forces and torques. We analyze the performance on test problems and present biological applications of sperm motility based on existing models of swimming flagella in open space and near a plane wall. The results show, for example, that because the forces along the flagellum vary mildly, a flagellum can be approximated with as few as 11 segments of length h while fixing the regularization parameter to epsilon = h/30, overcoming the need for hundreds of discretization nodes required by the MRS when c is small. The filament behaves like a slender cylindrical tube of radius approximate to 0.97 epsilon so that the value of epsilon influences the flagellum's swimming speed. For fixed regularization, doubling the number of line segments does not affect the results significantly as long as the force field is resolved. Examples that require rotlets and potential dipoles along the filament are also presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper compares and contrasts higher-order, semi-implicit temporal integration strategies for the incompressible Navier-Stokes methods based on spectral deferred corrections applied to certain gauge or auxiliary variable formulations of the equations. Particular focus is placed on the imposition of boundary conditions in the semi-implicit formulation, the accurate treatment of the pressure term, and the smoothness of the numerical solution for different formulations. The main result presented here is the formulation and numerical validation of a single-step, semi-implicit method called spectral deferred pressure corrections, which can in theory obtain arbitrary formal order of accuracy in time. Numerical results demonstrate up to eighth-order accuracy, scenarios where optimal temporal accuracy is attained, and scenarios where order reduction is observed due to time-dependent boundary conditions.

AB This study proposes a kinetic energy and entropy preserving scheme to achieve stable and non-dissipative compressible flow simulations. The proposed scheme is built in such a way that the numerical formulations satisfy the analytical relations among the governing equations at the discrete level. The mass and momentum convective terms are recast into split convective forms. Once the mass and momentum equations are discretized, the constraints given by the analytical relations subsequently determine the formulations of the numerical fluxes solved in the total energy equation. An analysis reveals that satisfying the analytical relations at the discrete level is essential for solving the energy exchange between the kinetic energy and internal energy correctly in the total energy equation, and therefore important for entropy conservation. Taylor-Green vortex and Euler isotropic turbulence simulations at infinite Reynolds number are conducted to verify the analysis given in this paper. The proposed scheme achieves both kinetic energy conservation in the incompressible limit and entropy conservation as well as convergences of thermodynamic variable fluctuations, whereas existing kinetic energy preserving schemes fail entropy conservation and the thermodynamic variable fluctuations diverge.

AB A structure-preserving discretization of the shallow-water equations on unstructured spherical grids is introduced. The unstructured grids that we consider have triangular cells with a C-type staggering of variables, where scalar variables are located at centres of grid cells and normal components of velocity are placed at cell boundaries. The staggering necessitates reconstructions and these reconstructions are build into the algorithm such that the resulting discrete equations obey a weighted weak form. This approach, combined with a mimetic discretization of the differential operators of the shallow-water equations, provides a conservative discretization that preserves important aspects of the mathematical structure of the continuous equations, most notably the simultaneous conservation of quadratic invariants such as energy and enstrophy. The structure-preserving nature of our discretization is confirmed through theoretical analysis and through numerical experiments on two different triangular grids, a symmetrized icosahedral grid of nearly uniform resolution and a non-uniform triangular grid whose resolution increases towards the poles.

AB We derive a method to locally change the order of accuracy of finite difference schemes that approximate the second derivative. The derivation is based on summation-by-parts operators, which are connected at interfaces using penalty terms. At such interfaces, the numerical solution has a double representation, with one representation in each domain. We merge this double representation into a single one, yielding a new scheme with unique solution values in all grid points. The resulting scheme is proven to be stable, accurate and dual consistent.

AB Large computation time is widely considered to be the most important issue in scientific research especially in solving structural evolution problems. Recent developments in this domain have shown that the use of non-incremental schemes through Model Order Reduction led to important results in saving time. Yet, the question arises here how to obtain more time-saving. This paper examines an approach based on a collection of significant modes given by Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) solution for different time scales in order to save more computation time. The dictionary of the significant modes allows to construct an accurate solution for different characteristic times and different boundary problems compared to the full solution with a relative error rate less than 5% and with a large time saving of order 50 compared to Finite Element Method (FEM). The ability of the approach with respect to cycle time is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The accuracy of Lagrangian point-particle models for simulation of particle-laden flows may degrade when the particle and fluid momentum equations are two-way coupled. The exchange of force between the fluid and particle changes the velocity of the fluid at the location of the particle, thereby modifying the slip velocity and producing an erroneous prediction of coupling forces between fluid and particle. In this article, we propose a correction scheme to reduce this error and predict the undisturbed fluid velocity accurately. Conceptually, in this method, the computation cell is treated as a solid object immersed in the fluid that is subjected to the two-way coupling force and dragged at a velocity that is identical to the disturbance created by the particle. The proposed scheme is generic as it can be applied to unstructured grids with arbitrary geometry, particles that have different size and density, and arbitrary interpolation scheme. In its crudest form for isotropic grids, the present correction scheme reduces to dividing the Stokes drag by 1 - 0.75A for A <= 1, where A is the ratio of the particle diameter to the grid size. The accuracy of the proposed scheme is evaluated by comparing the computed settling velocity of an individual and pair of particles under gravity on anisotropic rectilinear grids against analytical solutions. This comparison shows up to two orders of magnitude reduction in error in cases where the particle is up to 5 times larger than the grid that may have an aspect ratio of over 10. Furthermore, a comparison against a particle-resolved simulation of decaying isotropic turbulence demonstrates the excellent accuracy of the proposed scheme. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ID WAVELET COLLOCATION METHOD
AB This paper addresses one of the main challenges of the conservative level set method, namely the ill-conditioned behavior of the normal vector away from the interface. An alternative formulation for reconstruction of the interface is proposed. Unlike commonly used methods, which rely on a unit normal vector, the Stabilized Conservative Level Set (SCLS) makes use of a modified normal vector with diminishing magnitude away from the interface. With the new formulation, in the vicinity of the interface the reinitialization procedure utilizes compressive flux and diffusive terms only in normal direction with respect to the interface, thus, preserving the conservative level set properties, while away from the interface the directional diffusion mechanism automatically switches to homogeneous diffusion. The proposed formulation is robust and general. It is especially well suited for use with the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) approaches, since for computational accuracy high resolution is only required in the vicinity of the interface, while away from the interface low resolution simulations might be sufficient. All of the results reported in this paper are obtained using the Adaptive Wavelet Collocation Method, a general arbitrary order AMR-type method, which utilizes wavelet decomposition to adapt on steep gradients in the solution while retaining a predetermined order of accuracy. Numerical solution for a number of benchmark problems has been carried out to demonstrate the performance of the SCLS method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Multiple-resolution scheme in finite-volume code for active or passive

   Scalar turbulence
ID RAYLEIGH-BENARD CONVECTION; DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; FLOW; BULK
AB In scalar turbulence it is sometimes the case that the scalar diffusivity is smaller than the viscous diffusivity. The thermally-driven turbulent convection in water is a typical example. In such a case the smallest scale in the problem is the Batchelor scale l(b), rather than the Kolmogorov scale l(k), as l(b) = l(k)/Sc-1/2, where Sc is the Schmidt number (or Prandtl number in the case of temperature). In the numerical studies of such scalar turbulence, the conventional approach is to use a single grid for both the velocity and scalar fields. Such single-resolution scheme often over-resolves the velocity field because the resolution requirement for scalar is higher than that for the velocity field, since l(b) < l(k) for Sc > 1. In this paper we put forward an algorithm that implements the so-called multiple-resolution method with a finite-volume code. In this scheme, the velocity and pressure fields are solved in a coarse grid, while the scalar field is solved in a dense grid. The central idea is to implement the interpolation scheme on the framework of finite-volume to reconstruct the divergence-free velocity from the coarse to the dense grid. We demonstrate our method using a canonical model system of fluid turbulence, the Rayleigh-Benard convection. We show that, with the tailored mesh design, considerable speed-up for simulating scalar turbulence can be achieved, especially for large Schmidt (Prandtl) numbers. In the same time, sufficient accuracy of the scalar and velocity fields can be achieved by this multiple-resolution scheme. Although our algorithm is demonstrated with a case of an active scalar, it can be readily applied to passive scalar turbulent flows. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, we propose two new variants of fifth order finite difference WENO schemes of adaptive order. We compare our proposed schemes with other variants of WENO schemes with special emphasize on WENO-AO(5,3) scheme (Balsara et al., 2016) [3]. The first algorithm (WENO-AON(5,3)), involves the construction of a new simple smoothness indicator which reduces the computational cost of WENOA0(5,3) scheme. Numerical experiments show that accuracy of WENO-AON(5,3) scheme is comparable to that of WENO-AO(5,3) scheme and resolution of solutions involving shock or other discontinuities is comparable to that of WENO-AO(5,3) scheme. The second algorithm denoted as WENO-AO(5,4,3), involves the inclusion of an extra cubic polynomial reconstruction in the base WENO-AO(5,3) scheme, which leads to a more accurate scheme. Extensive numerical experiments in 1D and 2D are performed, which shows that WENO-AO(5,4,3) scheme has better resolution near shocks or discontinuities among the considered WENO schemes with negligible increase in computational cost.

AB In the interpolation method, in some cases, one often has a number of data points and its derivatives, which are obtained by sampling or experimentation. In this case, the problem of finding an approximating function passing through these points and coinciding with given values of its derivatives at these points is generally known as "Hermite interpolation". The Hermite interpolation is mostly a method of interpolating data points as a polynomial function that is faced with some challenges in high dimensions and on irregular domains. Radial basis functions take advantage of being flexible with respect to geometry, easy to implement in higher dimensions, and can also provide high order convergence. So, they can be applied as a suitable tool to high dimensional Hermite interpolation problem on irregular domains. In many applied systems, commonly available derivatives information is presented using fractional order derivatives instead of integer ones. For this purpose, in this paper, we assume that the values of an unknown function and its fractional derivatives at some distinct points are presented. Therefore, we intend to apply a new approach, which we call it as "fractional Hermite interpolation" with radial basis functions in high dimensions. Optimal recovery conditions for the fractional Hermite interpolant are investigated. Then, the existence and uniqueness of the solution in this type of generalized interpolation are proved. In order to increase the accuracy and stability of the method, Hilbert Schmidt's theory has also been used. The main advantages of the used method are its simplicity and efficiency in high dimensions, and over irregular domains. Finally, numerical results in one, two and three dimensions and a real-world problem are presented to support our theoretical analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We describe a compatible finite element discretisation for the shallow water equations on the rotating sphere, concentrating on integrating consistent upwind stabilisation into the framework. Although the prognostic variables are velocity and layer depth, the discretisation has a diagnostic potential vorticity that satisfies a stable upwinded advection equation through a Taylor-Galerkin scheme; this provides a mechanism for dissipating enstrophy at the gridscale whilst retaining optimal order consistency. We also use upwind discontinuous Galerkin schemes for the transport of layer depth. These transport schemes are incorporated into a semi-implicit formulation that is facilitated by a hybridisation method for solving the resulting mixed Helmholtz equation. We demonstrate that our discretisation achieves the expected second order convergence and provide results from some standard rotating sphere test problems. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

DE Eigenpair; Fixed point solutions; Solitons; Variational calculus
ID GROUND-STATE SOLUTION; ITERATION METHOD
AB This work is concerned with computing nonlinear eigenpairs, which model solitary waves and various other physical phenomena. We aim at solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems of the general form T (u) = lambda Q (u). In our setting T is a variational derivative of a convex functional (such as the Laplacian operator with respect to the Dirichlet energy), Q is an arbitrary bounded nonlinear operator and lambda is an unknown (real) eigenvalue. We introduce a flow that numerically generates an eigenpair solution by its steady state.
   Analysis for the general case is performed, showing a monotone decrease in the convex functional throughout the flow. When T is the Laplacian operator, a complete discretized version is presented and anlalyzed. We implement our algorithm on Korteweg and de Vries (KdV) and nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations in one and two dimensions. The proposed approach is very general and can be applied to a large variety of models. Moreover, it is highly robust to noise and to perturbations in the initial conditions, compared to classical Petiashvili-based methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB While high order methods became very popular as they allow to perform very accurate solutions with low computational time and memory cost, there is a lack of tools to visualize and post-treat the solutions given by these methods. Originally, visualization softwares were developed to post-process results from methods such that finite differences or usual finite elements and therefore process linear primitives. In this paper, we present a methodology to visualize results of high order methods. Our approach is based on the construction of an optimized affine approximation of the high order solution which can therefore be handled by any visualization software. A representation mesh is constructed and the process is guided by an a posteriori estimate which control the error between the numerical solution and its representation pointwise. This point by point control is crucial as under their picture form, data correspond to values mapped on elements where anyone can pick up a pointwise information. A strategy is established to ensure that discontinuities are well represented. These discontinuities come either from the physical problem (material change) or the numerical method (Discontinuous Galerkin method) and are pictured accurately. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the potential of the method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a dimensionally split method for computing solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on Cartesian cut cell meshes. The method is globally second order accurate in the L-1 norm, fully conservative, and allows the use of time steps determined by the regular grid spacing. We provide a description of the three-dimensional implementation of the method and evaluate its numerical performance by computing solutions to a number of test problems ranging from the nearly incompressible to the highly compressible flow regimes. All the computed results show good agreement with reference results from theory, experiment and previous numerical studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first presentation of a dimensionally split cut cell method for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper develops a new implementation coupling optimisation-based anisotropic mesh adaptivity algorithms to a moving mesh numerical scour model, considering both turbulent suspended and bedload sediment transport. The significant flexibility over mesh structure and resolution, in space and time, that the coupling of these approaches provides makes this framework highly suitable for resolving individual marine structure scales with larger scale ocean dynamics. The use of mesh optimisation addresses the issue of poor mesh quality and/or inappropriate resolution that have compromised existing modelling approaches that apply mesh movement strategies alone, especially in the case of extreme scour. Discontinuous Galerkin finite element-based discretisation methods and a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes-based turbulent modelling approach are used for the hydrodynamic fluid flow. In this work the model is verified in two dimensions for current-dominated scour near a horizontal pipeline. Combined adaptive mesh movement and anisotropic mesh optimisation is found to maintain both the quality and validity of the mesh in response to morphological bed evolution changes, even in the case where it is severely constrained by nearby structures.

AB The Riemann problem, and the associated generalized Riemann problem, are increasingly seen as the important building blocks for modern higher order Godunov-type schemes. In the past, building a generalized Riemann problem solver was seen as an intricately mathematical task because the associated Riemann problem is different for each hyperbolic system of interest. This paper changes that situation.
   The HLLI Riemann solver is a recently-proposed Riemann solver that is universal in that it is applicable to any hyperbolic system, whether in conservation form or with nonconservative products. The HLLI Riemann solver is also complete in the sense that if it is given a complete set of eigenvectors, it represents all waves with minimal dissipation. It is, therefore, very attractive to build a generalized Riemann problem solver version of the HLLI Riemann solver. This is the task that is accomplished in the present paper. We show that at second order, the generalized Riemann problem version of the HLLI Riemann solver is easy to design. Our GRP solver is also complete and universal because it inherits those good properties from original HLLI Riemann solver. We also show how our GRP solver can be adapted to the solution of hyperbolic systems with stiff source terms.
   Our generalized HLLI Riemann solver is easy to implement and performs robustly and well over a range of test problems. All implementation-related details are presented. Results from several stringent test problems are shown. These test problems are drawn from many different hyperbolic systems, and include hyperbolic systems in conservation form; with non-conservative products; and with stiff source terms. The present generalized Riemann problem solver performs well on all of them. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a fourth-order accurate finite volume method for the solution of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The numerical method combines high-order quadrature rules in the solution of semi-discrete formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws with the upwind constrained transport (UCT) framework to ensure that the divergence-free constraint of the magnetic field is satisfied. A novel implementation of UCT that uses the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) for the reconstruction of magnetic fields at cell corners in 2D is introduced. The resulting scheme can be expressed as the extension of the second-order accurate constrained transport (CT) Godunov-type scheme that is currently used in the Athena astrophysics code. After validating the base algorithm on a series of hydrodynamics test problems, we present the results of multidimensional MHD test problems which demonstrate formal fourth-order convergence for smooth problems, robustness for discontinuous problems, and improved accuracy relative to the second-order scheme.

AB In this work, we consider the problem of estimating summary statistics to characterise biochemical reaction networks of interest. Such networks are often described using the framework of the Chemical Master Equation (CME). For physically-realistic models, the CME is widely considered to be analytically intractable. A variety of Monte Carlo algorithms have therefore been developed to explore the dynamics of such networks empirically. Amongst them is the multi-level method, which uses estimates from multiple ensembles of sample paths of different accuracies to estimate a summary statistic of interest. In this work, we develop the multi-level method in two directions: (1) to increase the robustness, reliability and performance of the multi-level method, we implement an improved variance reduction method for generating the sample paths of each ensemble; and (2) to improve computational performance, we demonstrate the successful use of a different mechanism for choosing which ensembles should be included in the multi-level algorithm.

ID GENERALIZED SHAPIRO FILTERS; EXPLICIT
AB The current study investigates the use of solution filtering and artificial dissipation as stabilization methods for time-accurate computations, notably focusing on how the decoupling of dissipation from integration impacts simulation error. Rewriting solution filtering in an effective artificial-dissipation form explicitly reveals the issue of temporal inconsistency, which is addressed by a proposed CFL re-scaling. In addition, expressing symmetric discrete filters as difference operators inspires the derivation of a "filter-based" artificial-dissipation formulation that provides the opportunity for direct spectral manipulation by utilizing known filter stencil specifications; this furthermore facilitates the creation of Rade-type artificial dissipation terms with spectrally tunable and scalediscriminant properties. Damping characteristics of the schemes are assessed through von Neumann analysis and are confirmed via simulations of the one-dimensional advection equation (wave-packet transport) as well as the three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes system (Taylor-Green vortex), where the impact of time step size on accuracy of the respective stabilization techniques is inspected.

AB Different amounts of GeO2 activated tellurite tungstate glasses were prepared by melt quenching technique. Thermal stability and glass forming ability were studied using differential scanning calorimetry. The chemical composition, homogeneity and amorphous nature of studied glasses were investigated. The phonon energy was estimated to be 721.34 cm(-1). Experimentally determined refractive indices were compared with those determined from optical band gap (E-g) and optical electronegativity (Delta chi*). The dielectric constant (K) and electronic polarizability (alpha) were determined using refractive index value. The presence of disorder was estimated in terms of Urbach energy (E-U). The average electronegativity (chi(ave)), oxide ion polarizability (ao(2-)) and covalent character (C-cov) were determined. The content of GeO2 was optimized to be 10.0 mol% to design a novel host material for solid state lasers and fiber devices.

AB In this paper, the modified Kissinger equation and the Ozava type equation were obtained by using a process of homogenization from dimensional analysis, thus making them correct in relation to the application of a logarithmic function. An equation that holds at maximum reaction rate is applied for the chosen reference heating rate beta(r), and also for a heating rate beta(i), that was used. In that way the modified Kissinger equation ln(T-mr(2)/T-mi(2) beta(i)/beta(r)) = -E/R 1/T-mi + E/R 1/T-mr was obtained. The modified Ozava type equation was obtained in the form.
   ln(beta(i)/beta(r)) = -mE/nR 1/T-mi + mE/nR 1/T-mr
   where T-mr and T-mi are the temperatures of the maximum obtained with beta(r) and beta(i) respectively. In these equations, free terms are explicitly defined and from their values it is possible to calculate the value of activation energy E, as from the slope of straight lines. The main advantage of the modified equations compared to the original Kissinger equation and the Ozava type equation is not the more accurate value of the activation energy, but the more precise form of the equation.
   With the goal to overcome all imperfections of the Lasocka equation, we propose the modified relationship T-g = A(g) + B-g log(beta/beta(r) + 1) between the glass transition temperature Tg and the heating rate beta. In this equation, the logarithm is calculated from dimensionless values, where beta(r) is the chosen reference heating rate. In contrast to the original Lasocka equation, the modified Lasocka equation parameters A(g) and B-g have the same units. The temperature T-g0 = A(g) can be obtained by extrapolation of experimental results to beta = 0. This is impossible to get from the original Lasocka equation, but it can be obtained from the modified one.

AB The near similar to 3 pm mid-infrared laser demonstrates real and potential applications in many military and civilian areas, but the lack of host materials with nice optical quality and the overlapped vibrations of OH- hamper the emission intensity. To eliminate the OH-absorption, ZnF2 was adopted in Yb3+/Ho3+ codoped binary TeO2-PbF2 glass to partially till totally replace PbF2. The high ZnF2 concentration would raise the glass transition temperature and enhance the thermal stability of matrix, especially enhance the intensity of 2.85 mu m mid-infrared luminescence obviously. TeO2-ZnF2 glass with 45.5% ZnF2 original content has high ratio of the strength parameter Omega(4)/Omega(6) (= 2.90) and possesses higher spontaneous transition probability (45.25 S-1) along with the larger calculated emission cross section (0.96 x 10(-20) cm(2)) corresponding Ho3+: I-5(6) -> I-5(7) transition. Fourier transmittance of infrared spectra revealed ZnF2 could reduce the OH- concentration in glass substantially, which were favor of 2.85 mu m mid-infrared emission. Our results indicated that the use of ZnF2 to effectively remove the hydroxyl groups is an efficacious way to develop near similar to 3 mu m mid-infrared optical glass with high efficient luminescence and thermochemical reliability.

AB Various composition of lead bismuth titanate borosilicate glasses doped with one mol percent of cerium oxide in the system 55[(PbxBi1-x)TiO3]-44[2SiO(2)center dot B2O3]-1CeO(2) (0.0 <= x <= 1.0) were prepared using rapid melt quenching technique. X-ray diffraction study confirmed the amorphous nature of the samples. Structural and optical properties of the glass samples were carried out using infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and UV-vis spectroscopy respectively. Absorption peaks in IR spectra mainly occurred due to asymmetric vibrational stretching modes of the B-O bond of trigonal BO3 units. Raman study revealed that the structural network of B-O-B stretching in metaborate rings of the glass sample. The optical band gap values were determined from Davis and Mott plots. On the basis of the differential thermal analysis, all glass samples were crystallized by given a controlled heat treatment schedule within the temperature range 607-693 degrees C. For the determination of phase, crystal structure and crystallite size, XRD was also performed on the glass ceramic samples. To understand the surface morphology of the glass ceramic samples, scanning electron microscopy was employed. The dielectric properties were studied with varying temperature at few selected frequencies. The maximum value of relative dielectric constant, epsilon(r) was found to be 973 at 100 Hz with dissipation factor, D, 3.99 for bismuth free lead titanate glass ceramic sample (x = 1.0).

AB The influence of hydrogenation on the atomic structure and electronic properties of amorphous boron nitride (alpha-BN) is investigated by using an ab-initio molecular dynamics technique. The structural evaluation of alpha-BN and the hydrogenated (alpha-BN:H) models with four different hydrogen concentrations reveals that although their short-range order is mainly similar to each other, hydrogenation yields some noticeable amendments on the local structure of alpha-BN. Hydrogenation suppresses the formation of twofold coordinated chain-like structures and tetragonal-like rings and leads to more sp(2) and even sp(3) hybridizations. It is also observed that the formation of N-H bonding is more favorable than that of the B-H bonding in the alpha-BN:H configurations. Furthermore hydrogenation is found to have an insignificant impact on the electronic structure of alpha-BN.

AB A topological constraint model is developed to elucidate the coordination environment of alkali tellurite glasses. The model is derived from temperature-dependent constraint theory and provides a quantitative connection between the connectivity of the glass network and the compositional dependence of the glass transition temperature (T-g). Our model gives support to the model proposed by Barney et al. [J.Phys. Chem Lett4, 2312-2316 (2013)], confirming their model of the coordination environment in alkali tellurites. The model simultaneously serves as a framework that can be used in binary alkali glass-formers to predict an expected coordination the network forming cation in an oxide glass.

DE Order parameter; Liquid; Amorphous; Alloys
ID SHORT-RANGE ORDER; CHEMICAL ORDER; NEUTRON; SCATTERING
AB In this work, a rigorous mathematical method to calculate the order parameter in a binary amorphous or liquid alloy, is established even when the alloy is made up of very differently sized atoms. This method, based on the study of the eigenstates of the exchange operator of the alloy components, allows revealing different spherical layers whose inner and outer radii are solutions of a certain equation. These layers have no constant thickness but contain numbers of atoms of each species that are exactly in the ratio of the concentrations of these two species. Thus, each layer has exactly the average concentration of the alloy, allowing to properly formalize the order parameter. Thus the order parameter is formalized in each of these layers. This method makes possible to retrieve the subtle Bhatia-Thomton formalism [Phys. Rev., B2, 3004 (1970)] used for the description of binary alloys. We discuss the link between the zero q value of concentration-concentration Bhatia-Thornton partial structure factor and the numbers of neighbours. We apply our method to study the order in the Bi0.3Ga0.7 liquid alloy. We are able to determine eight layers and their order parameter on the interatomic distance-range [0, 15 angstrom]

AB It is well-known that the sliding contact damage of glass materials is very sensitive to the presence of water, but the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. In this work, the effects of water and speed on wear behaviors of soda lime silica (SLS) glass are investigated upon a ball-on-flat reciprocating tribometer in dry and humid air. When water molecules are present at the sliding interfaces in humid air, the wear volume of SLS glass decreases with the increase in sliding speed from 0.25 mm/s to 8 mm/s, which is believed to be originated from the suppressed tribochemical reactions involving water molecules at high speed conditions, therein the wear volume of SLS glass decreases to similar to 6 times. However, when water molecules are absent at the sliding interfaces in dry air, the wear volume of SLS glass increases to similar to 12.5 times when the sliding speed increases from 0.25 mm/s to 8 mm/s. Analyses suggest that the wear of SLS glass in dry air is dominated by the adhesive wear and brittle exfoliation, which can be facilitated by the friction-induced temperature rise and surface cracking at high speed conditions. Our results indicate that the sliding speed can either promote or suppress the wear of SLS glass, depending on the presence of water molecules at the sliding interfaces. These results may provide a deep understanding on the effects of water and speed on the material damage of oxide glass materials during its manufacturing and operation processes.

AB The viscoelastic properties of supercooled AsxSe100-x, (0 <= x <= 30) and AsxSe100-x-yIy (x = 20, 30 and y = 10, 20) liquids are studied using oscillatory parallel plate rheometry. In addition to the alpha-relaxation process, the shear relaxation of liquids with selenium chains longer than similar to 3 atoms is also characterized by a low-frequency polymeric mode. The temporal decoupling of this low-frequency soft/floppy relaxation mode from that of the a relaxation mode is a unique function of the average selenium chain length. The floppy mode abruptly vanishes for liquids with average chain lengths shorter than similar to 3 Se atoms, thus implying a dynamical rigidity transition. When taken together, these results indicate that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the pertinent structural variable associated with such transition in the viscoelastic behavior is not the average coordination number but instead the intermediate-range structural elements such as the average selenium chain length.

AB A The comment by Popov raises two questions related to (a) whether the glassy state can more appropriately be described as metastable or unstable and (b) whether the supercooled liquid state exists below the glass transition temperature, T-g. We argue that the glassy state is thermodynamically unstable, as it continuously and spontaneously relaxes toward the metastable supercooled liquid state at any nonzero temperature. Moreover, the supercooled liquid state the target for the glass relaxation process-exists at any temperature below the liquidus temperature of a system. There is no problem with having a missing target for the glass relaxation process, since this metastable supercooled liquid state can always be defined.

AB The adaptor-related protein (AP) complexes play important roles in cargo selection and vesicle formation, and hence in intracellular membrane trafficking. Five different AP complexes are currently known, each consisting of four subunits, known as adaptins. AP-2, the most thoroughly characterized of the five AP complexes, facilitates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we describe the discovery and molecular cloning of seventy-seven novel alternatively spliced transcripts of the human AP2A1 gene, which encodes the alpha A adaptin of the AP-2 complex. For this purpose, we have used Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), a powerful tool for studying alternative splicing. In brief, we subcultured fifty-five established human cell lines, originating from several distinct cancerous and normal tissues, extracted total RNA, and synthesized first-strand cDNA. Next, we used nested touchdown PCR to amplify the whole coding region of the AP2A1 transcripts of each cell line, mixed all PCR products, and proceeded to NGS library construction, template preparation, and semiconductor sequencing. Extensive bioinformatic analysis revealed thirteen novel splice junctions of previously annotated exons, as also verified via nested PCR with primers targeting these splice junctions. Moreover, consecutive nested PCRs led to the determination of the primary structure of seventy-seven novel AP2A1 transcripts, all of which were shown to comprise at least one premature translation termination codon, thus representing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) candidates. NMD is a mechanism that cells use to control gene expression. Consequently, alterations in the levels of these potentially non-coding AP2A1 transcripts could lead to a decrease in the number of AP2A1 mRNA molecules, when needed. Undoubtedly, the exact role of these new APA1 splice variants merits elucidation.

AB Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which affects children and young adults, caused by a persistent infection of defective measles virus. IFN-lambda s (IL-28A, IL-28B and IL-29) are a group of cytokines mediating antiviral responses. It has been shown that IL-29 levels are significantly higher in infected cells with defective measles virus. IL-29 expression is thought to be regulated at post-transcriptional level and miRNA-548 family targets the 3'UTR of the IFNL1 gene. Impaired immune system has an important role as well as viral factors in SSPE. The aim of our study investigates whether IL-28B, IL-29 levels and gene polymorphisms contribute to the damaged immune response leading to the development of SSPE. Also possible association of miR-548 family with IL-29 and SSPE is explored.
   Frequencies of rs12979860, rs8099917, rs30461, serum levels of IL-28B, IL-29 and expression levels of miR-548b, miR-548c, miR-548i are determined at 64 SSPE patients and 68 healthy controls. Serum IL-29 levels are statistically significant higher in SSPE patients. Allele frequencies of rs8099917 are statistically significant higher in SSPE patients and resulted G allele is found to increase 2.183-fold risk of SSPE. The expression levels of miR-548b-5p, miR-548c-5p and miR-548i are found to be statistically significant higher in SSPE patients.
   Dramatically increased level of IL-29 seen in patient group indicates that the elevated miR-548 expression is compensatory result of the over-activated immune system response. Further studies referred to IL28, IL29 and related miRNA's will be enlightened the pathogenesis of SSPE.

DE Multiple spines; Differentially expressed genes; miRNA; RNA-seq
ID VERTEBRAE; NUMBER; GENES; MAMMALS; PLANT
AB The formation of the spine is a critical stage of mammalian development. The increase of the number of individual axons affects its performance, especially in meat production. To understand the role of miRNAs in sheep vertebrae development, the purpose of this article is to screen candidate microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with sheep spine development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a rich family of small regulatory RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing techniques to analyze the microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profiles of L6 (6 lumbar vertebrae) and L7 (7 lumbar vertebrae) in sheep. A total number of 223 miRNAs were detected in the two libraries, and a total of 150 and 148 conserved miRNAs were obtained in L6 and L7, respectively. A total of 5 miRNAs expression differences in L6 compared to L7 (P < 0.05). Of the five obviously differently expressed miRNAs, four miRNAs were down regulated in the L6 of sheep, and one was up-regulated. In order to further explore the functions of these miRNAs, we predicted the target genes of these differently expressed miRNAs, and obtained 1298 target genes. At the same time, NDRG2 gene, targeted by novel miR-391, which possible plays an important role in the development of the spine. Linkage-integration analysis method was used to construct the interaction network of spinal-associated miRNA and its hypothesized target. In summary, this study provides valuable resources for the transcriptome of multiple vertebral traits in sheep.

AB Chromosome 4q12 and 17q12 have been identified as two regions associated with susceptibility to cervical cancer in a genome-wide association study. To identify potential causal variants within these two regions, we conducted a case-control study including 1486 patients with cervical cancer and 1536 age-matched (+/- 5 years) healthy controls. Based on RegulomeDB database, 12 potentially functional variants were selected and then genotyped by using Sequenom MassARRAY. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations. We found that the G allele of rs8076131 and the A allele of rs12150079 in 17q12 region were significantly associated with increased risk of cervical cancer (adjusted OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02-1.30, P = 0.02 for rs8076131; adjusted OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.03-1.36, P = 0.02 for rs12150079). Individuals with 3-4 risk alleles of these two variants had 24% higher odds of cervical cancer than those without the risk alleles (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.07-1.44, P < 0.01). The stratified analysis showed that the associations of rs8076131 and rs12150079 with cervical cancer risk were statistically significant in subgroups of older menarche age (> 16 years), more parities (>= 2), nonsmokers, and having no family cancer history, but the test results for subgroup heterogeneity were not significant. The current study provides the evidence that rs8076131 and rs12150079 in 17q12 region may contribute to cervical cancer susceptibility in the Han Chinese population.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to perform important roles in cancer development. Previously, we have shown that lncRNA gastric cancer-associated transcript 3 (GACAT3) is overexpressed in gastric cancer and acts as a downstream target of interleukin 6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/STAT3) signaling. However, the role of GACAT3 in regulating gastric cancer cell growth remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that GACAT3 acts as a competing endogenous RNA of high mobility group A1 (HMGA1), a typical oncogene that is overexpressed in most types of cancer, based on a search for common miRNA-binding sites and on experiments involving in vitro cell transfection with synthesized miRNA mimics. Furthermore, knockdown of GACAT3 by its specific siRNA resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation in gastric cancer cells, similar to the effect of an HMGA1 knockdown. Moreover, GACAT3 overexpression alleviated the apoptosis induced by cucurbitacin B, which is a widely used anticancer drug. Mechanistically, GACAT3 amplified STAT3 expression and decreased the level of the apoptosis gene bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). Thus, our study provides fundamental information regarding GACAT3, which could be a valuable target for gastric cancer therapy.

AB Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficient activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase resulting in the accumulation of glucosylceramide. Bone disease is a common feature with radiological evidence in up to 93% of patients. Severity of bone involvement ranges from osteoporosis to pathological fractures. The progressive course of type 1 GD is largely mitigated by treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction. A number of studies have shown some patients suffer bone events while receiving ERT. Studies of biochemical markers of bone turnover have generated varied results and as a consequence are not generally used to assess bone disease in GD. In vitro osteoclast generation from peripheral blood samples of 74 Gaucher patients followed over a period of up to 10 years was correlated with bone events, reports of bone pain, anaemia, spleen status, bone mineral density, chitotriosidase activity, treatment with Gaucher specific therapies, bisphosphonates, mutation status and severity. Osteoclast generation, enumerated when cultured on glass, was significantly higher when differentiated from the peripheral blood of Gaucher patients which reported bone pain (116.4 +/- 18.0 vs 69.0 +/- 8.6, p < 0.01), had anaemia (153.7 +/- 34.9 vs 78.5 +/- 8.8, p < 0.01), had a splenectomy (137.6 +/- 41.1 vs 60.8 +/- 13.0, p < 0.05), versus those who did not. Osteoclast generation was also indicative of in vivo Gaucher specific therapy response as those naive to therapy generated significantly more osteoclasts than those on therapy (111.2 +/- 35.8 vs 45.1 +/- 10.3, p < 0.05), as did patients receiving therapy but still suffering bone events (125.1 +/- 31.37 vs 45.1 +/- 10.33, p < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that the in vitro osteoclast assay may be a useful method for following bone disease progression in Gaucher patients.

AB Background: Sugarcane smut, which is caused by Sporisorium scitamineum, is a severe fungal disease affecting sugarcane. However, the major pathways involved in the interaction between sugarcane and S. scitamineum remains unclear.
   Results: In the present study, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) library construction, together with reverse northern blotting, was conducted on the most prevalent sugarcane genotype ROC22 challenged with S. scitamineum. After alignment and homologous expressed sequence tag (EST) assembly, a total of 155 differentially expressed unigenes were identified from SSH libraries. Totally, 26 of 155 differentially expressed unigenes were analyzed by qRT-PCR in sugarcane smut-resistant genotype YC05-179 and susceptible genotype ROC22. Genes encoded two unknown protein (Q1 and Q11), serine/threonine kinase (Q2), fiber protein (Q3), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (Q23), and Sc14-3-3-like protein (Q24) were induced in sugarcane smut-resistant genotype YC05-179 but inhibited in susceptible genotype ROC22. Based on the differential expression data achieved from SSH libraries and qRT-PCR, we found that, serine/threonine kinases, Ca2+ sensors, mitogen-activated protein genes and some NBS-LRR genes may involve in the signal recognition and transduction of smut fungus infection in sugarcane. While in the plant hormone signaling pathways, the genes related to auxin, abscisic acid, salicylic acid and ethylene were more apparently in response to smut fungus invasion. The hypersensitive response, protein metabolism, polyamine synthesis, and cell wall formation may play an important role in sugarcane defense against smut fungus colonization. Additionally, the Sc14-3-3 might serve as a molecular modulator in sugarcane being immune to smut disease by interacting with proteins like ScGAPN (Q10), which have been further verified by BiFC assay.
   Conclusions: The findings of the present study could provide a general view about gene pathways involving in sugarcane defense against smut disease and facilitate a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying sugarcane-S. scitamineum interaction.

AB HIF prolyl hydroxylase 1 (PHD1) functions in prolyl hydroxylation on mammal hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), important transcription factors involved in hypoxia, however the roles of Phd1 in fish remain unclear. In this study, the full-length cDNA and promoter sequences of blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) phd1 gene were isolated by a modified RACE strategy. The phd1 cDNA was 2672 bp for encoding 481 amino acid residues. In silica assays indicated that phd1 had 5 exons, and a 348 bp CpG island in the exon1, and several transcription factor binding sites (CAAT box, HRE, ARNT, FOX, etc) were also found on the promoter. The quantitative real-time PCR results suggested that phd1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in all detected tissues, and higher in the blood, brain and heart in normoxia, but significantly decreased after hypoxia in all detected tissues except for gill. Western blot assays indicated that two Phd1 isoforms were generated by alternative translation initiation. Moreover, these two isoforms were both localized in the nucleus, therein only the senior isoform promoted cell proliferation. Taken together, the present study firstly describes the functions of M. amblycephala two Phd1 isoforms in hypoxia and cell proliferation.

AB Host defense peptides (HDPs) represent a large group of diverse small peptides that play important roles in host defense and disease resistance. In vertebrates, one of the main types of HDPs belong to defensins, which are less than 100 amino acid residues and characterized by a highly conserved motif of cysteine residues. Recently, a subfamily of defensins, namely ovodefensins (OvoDs), has been identified in birds and reptiles. However, both their family members and evolutionary relationships remain unclear. In the present study, we cloned and characterized a novel gene namely OvoDB beta in chickens. Our results showed that the full length of chicken OvoDB beta mRNA contains 344 bp nucleotides and encodes a 61-amino acid protein. We further revealed that the mRNA of OvoDB beta is abundant in the oviduct of laying hens but absent in many other tissues. Additionally, sequences comparison and analyses suggested that OvoDB beta is orthologous to the gene previously known as zebra finch OvoDB1, albeit it might exhibit specific structures. Furthermore, both OvoDB alpha and OvoDB beta were existent in the genome of each bird, implying that two types of OvoDBs sharing same cysteine motif have already emerged before the species divergence. More importantly, recombinant OvoDB beta mature peptide exerted antibacterial activity against Escherischia coli (CICC23657 strain) in vitro. These results collectively indicated that the putative sequence, namely chicken OvoDB beta, is a function gene with potential antimicrobial property. Discovery and function characterization of novel HDP genes may help us develop novel antimicrobial agents in the future.

AB Aim The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of beta-catenin immunohistochemical expression on the prognostic of ovarian cancer (OC) for that beta-catenin could be responsible for the development and progress of OC.
   Methods: We searched various databases to identify eligible studies, and Review Managers 5.2 software was fulfilled in the meta-analysis.
   Results: A total of 11 studies were defined and composed in 1858 cases. beta-catenin expression was significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) in OC patients (HR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.38-4.47, P = 0.003), and showed a significant degree of heterogeneity (I-2 = 83%, P < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis indicated that accumulation in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm, rather than membrane, considerably influences the survival of OC patients independently.
   Conclusion: Nucleus and/or cytoplasma of beta-catenin expression might be associated with tumor progression and could be a possible potential predictive factor of poor prognosis in OC patients.

AB Background: Studies have suggested that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) stimulates scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) to promote hepatic uptake of cholesterol. SR-B1 is encoded by scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) gene in human. A rare mutation in SCARB1 gene has been associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). A polymorphism rs5888 of SCARB1 gene has been linked to CHD risk in humans.
   Objectives: The objective was to investigate the relationship between the SCARB1 gene polymorphism rs5888 and risk of CHD.
   Methods: We searched databases of case-control studies and cohort studies on rs5888 polymorphism of SCARB1 gene and risk of CHD. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data, and estimated potential bias of included studies. The quality of the studies was evaluated by recommendation of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis was performed with Stata 12.0 software.
   Results: Seven studies including 6360 subjects (cases: 2456, controls: 3904) were included in the final data combination. Meta-analysis showed T allele had a lower risk of CHD as compared to C allele in allele model (T vs. C: OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.09, P = 0.229). Moreover, we found that T allele or TT/TC had a lower risk of CHD as compared to C/CC in male in allele model (T vs. C: OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.01). However, no significant association was observed in women in all allele models.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggested that polymorphism rs5888 had negative association with CHD, especially in male. However, the conclusion needs further verification with high quality studies with larger sample size and rigorous designs.

DE G6PD deficiency; Genotype; China; Guangdong province
ID MUTATIONS
AB Background: G6PD deficiency presents a higher incidence rate in southern China. Many variants of G6PD resulted from point mutations in the G6PD gene, which lead to decrease of enzyme activity. The objective of this study was to analyze the genotype of G6PD deficiency in four regions of Guangdong province.
   Methods: Genotype of 1756 cases with G6PD deficiency was identified by reverse dot blotting (RDB). Unidentified Genotype of the samples was further ascertained by direct DNA sequencing.
   Results: 34 genotype were found in 1756 cases of G6PD deficiency, Canton (c.1376 G > T) and Kaiping (c.1388 G > A) were the most common variants, accounting for more than 63% of G6PD deficiency individuals, and the following mutations were Gaohe (c.95 A > G), Chinese-5 (c.1024 C > T) and Chinese-4 (c.392 G > T). Two rare mutations Orisa (c.131 C > G) and IVS-5 637/638 T del have been discovered in this study. In addition, c.1311 C > T/IVS-1193 T > C polymorphism had a relatively high frequency in the normal G6PD individuals.
   Conclusions: This study provided detailed genotypes of G6PD deficiency in Guangdong, and would be valuable for diagnosis and research of G6PD deficiency in this area.

AB Retrogenes are a class of functional genes derived from the mRNA of various intron-containing genes. PIPSL was created through a unique mechanism, whereby distinct genes were assembled at the RNA level, and the resulting chimera was then reverse transcribed and integrated into the genome by the L1 retrotransposon. Expression of PIPSL RNA via its transcription start sites (TSSs) has been confirmed in the testes of humans and chimpanzee. Here, we demonstrated that PIPSL RNA is expressed in the testis of the white-handed gibbon. The 5'-end positions of gibbon RNAs were confined to a narrow range upstream of the PIPSL start codon and overlapped with those of orangutan and human, suggesting that PIPSL TSSs are similar among hominoid species. Reporter assays using a luciferase gene and the flanking sequences of human PIPSL showed that an upstream sequence exhibits weak promoter activity in human cells. Our findings suggest that PIPSL might have acquired a promoter at an early stage of hominoid evolution before the divergence of gibbons and ultimately retained similar TSSs in all of the lineages. Moreover, the upstream sequence derived from the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, type I, alpha 5' untranslated region and/or neighboring repetitive sequences in the genome possibly exhibits promoter activity. Furthermore, we observed that a TATA-box-like sequence has emerged by nucleotide substitution in a lineage leading to humans, with this possibly responsible for a broader distribution of the human PIPSL TSSs.

AB Objectives: To conduct an integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression profile and further discover vital molecules to uncover novel pathogenic mechanisms in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC).
   Materials and methods: MicroRNA and mRNA expression profiles were obtained from six paired primary SACC tumors and corresponding adjacent normal glands using high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology followed by an overall integrated bioinformatics analysis and subsequently molecular biology techniques validation.
   Results: Compared with adjacent noncancerous normal gland, 2107 significant differentially expressed mRNA were determined in SACC. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis suggested that the differentially expressed genes were relevant to many significant biological implications. Venn diagram analysis of differentially expressed genes in different group identified 29 differentially expressed overlapping mRNA. 40 differentially expressed microRNAs were also identified in SACC. Furthermore, integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression profiles recognized a core microRNA-mRNA regulatory network and unmasked many novel genes including SCUBE3, CA6, hsa-miR-885-5p and other molecules which may play an essential role in the carcinogenesis of SACC. Also, Q-PCR and immunohistochemistry results reveal the high expression and distribution of SCUBE3 in SACC and dual luciferase reporter assay also preliminarily validated that SCUBE3 was a target of hsamiR-885-5p.
   Conclusion: Contemporary microRNA/mRNA analysis have uncovered many mRNAs and microRNAs worthy further exploration in SACC. These are bound to help us shed light on the overall genetic background of SACC and further elucidate the potential molecular mechanism of SACC.

AB Background and objective: CYP2R1 is a key gene in the vitamin D metabolic pathway. It has been suggested that CYP2R1 gene variants in European populations are associated with concentrations of 25(OH)D, a biomarker of vitamin D levels and status in peripheral blood. However, a comprehensive meta-analysis of this effect including different ethnicitieshas never been conducted. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between CYP2R1 gene variants and 25(OH)D levels and vitamin D status.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang databases were systematically searched up to May 2018. Reporting followed PRISMA guidelines. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the STREGA system. Random or fixed effects model combined estimates and sub-group tested for ethnic differences. The I2 statistic quantified between-study variation due to heterogeneity.
   Results: Sixteen articles with a total of 52,417 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. For rs10741657, GG genotype was associated with a clear descending trend of 25(OH)D levels when compared with the AA genotype [SMD = 2.32, 95% CI (-4.42, -0.20); SMD = -3.46, 95% CI (-6.60, -0.33) and SMD = -0.24, 95% CI (-0.51, -0.03) for total, Caucasian and Asian groups, respectively] with the following heterogeneities I-2 = 37.9%, 69.2% and 24.5%, respectively. However, under the AG/AA genetic model, significant changes in 25(OH)D levels [SMD and 95% CI: -1.27(-2.32, -0.23)] were only evident in the Caucasian population. The meta-analysis on vitamin D deficiency showed that the risk-allele G was associated with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03-1.15, P = 0.002). The association between rs10741657 and increased risk of vitamin D deficiency was significant (OR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.11-1.83, P = 0.006) under the dominant model (GG + AG/AA), but not under the recessive model (GG/AG + AA), (OR = 1.28; 95% CI = 0.89-1.84, P = 0.181). There was no evidence of publication bias.
   Conclusion: Published articles provide evidence supporting a major role for the rs10741657 polymorphism of the CYP2R1 gene in determining 25(OH)D levels and the presence of vitamin D deficiency.

AB Introduction: Vitamin-D plays a role regulating the immune response against to viral infection. In this sense, vitamin-D deficiency may confer increased susceptibility to enveloped virus infection such as HIV, Hepatitis, Dengue and Respiratory Syncytial virus infection, among others. Vitamin D activity is mediated by its receptor (VDR), which acts as a transcription factor modulating the expression of genes triggering the response against viruses. To date, six major VDR polymorphisms (Cdx, A1012G, Fokl, BsmI, Apal and TaqI) have been studied in the context of viral infection susceptibility. Reported studies show controversial results probably due to statistical lack of power and population genetic differences.
   Aims: To do a systematic review of the published data and to perform a meta-analysis examining the role of six VDR polymorphisms on infection susceptibility to enveloped virus.
   Results: From all markers and virus considered an association of FokI polymorphism with RSV infection emerges as significant. The worldwide distribution of risk T-allele reveals a lower prevalence in African populations that runs parallel with the relative lower incidence of RSV-associated severe ALRI in children < 1 year described in African samples.
   Conclusion: The results disclose FokI polymorphism as a relevant variant capturing the association of VDR polymorphisms with viral infection.

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

ID CAUSAL
AB Vulnerability assessment and security configuration activities are heavily reliant on expert knowledge. This requirement often results in many systems being left insecure due to a lack of analysis expertise and access to specialist resources. It has long been known that a system's event logs provide historical information depicting potential security breaches, as well as recording configuration activities. However, identifying and utilising knowledge within the event logs is challenging for the non-expert. In this paper, a novel technique is developed to process security event logs of a computer that has been assessed and configured by a security professional, extract key domain knowledge indicative of their expert decision making, and automatically apply learnt knowledge to previously unseen systems by non-experts. The technique converts event log entries into an object-based model and dynamically extracts associative rules. The rules are further improved in terms of quality using a temporal metric to autonomously establish temporal-association rules and acquire a domain model of expert configuration tasks. The acquired domain model and problem instance generated from a previously unseen system can then be used to produce a plan-of-action, which can be exploited by non-professionals to improve their system's security. Empirical analysis is subsequently performed on 20 event logs, where identified plan traces are discussed in terms of accuracy and performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social networks have become a source of data which are of interest in all areas, and their querying and analysis is a hot topic in computer science. Our research group has developed a fuzzy extension of the Semantic Web query language SPARQL, called FSA-SPARQL (Fuzzy Sets and Aggregators based SPARQL). This extension provides mechanisms to express fuzzy queries against RDF data. FSA-SPARQL works with social networks. With this aim, FSA-SPARQL enables the transformation and fuzzification of social network API data. Fuzzification of social networks data is automatic and user-defined enabling a wide range of mechanisms for ranking and categorization, including sentiment analysis and topic detection. As a case study, FSA-SPARQL has been used to query three well-known social networks: Twitter, Foursquare and TMDb. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB User-generated content published on microblogging social networks constitutes a priceless source of information. However, microtexts usually deviate from the standard lexical and grammatical rules of the language, thus making its processing by traditional intelligent systems very difficult. As an answer, microtext normalization consists in transforming those non-standard microtexts into standard well-written texts as a preprocessing step, allowing traditional approaches to continue with their usual processing. Given the importance of phonetic phenomena in non-standard text formation, an essential element of the knowledge base of a normalizer would be the phonetic rules that encode these phenomena, which can be found in the so-called phonetic algorithms.
   In this work we experiment with a wide range of phonetic algorithms for the English language. The aim of this study is to determine the best phonetic algorithms within the context of candidate generation for microtext normalization. In other words, we intend to find those algorithms that taking as input nonstandard terms to be normalized allow us to obtain as output the smallest possible sets of normalization candidates which still contain the corresponding target standard words. As it will be stated, the choice of the phonetic algorithm will depend heavily on the capabilities of the candidate selection mechanism which we usually find at the end of a microtext normalization pipeline. The faster it can make the right choices among big enough sets of candidates, the more we can sacrifice on the precision of the phonetic algorithms in favour of coverage in order to increase the overall performance of the normalization system.

AB The process for evaluating and selecting design alternatives is a key stage in the development of a product and can, in essence, be considered a decision-making process. In order to manage this process, Value Methodologies are considered as an important decision support tool, especially by means of the calculation of the Value Index factor, I-vf, for each one of the product functions as a representation of its 'satisfaction'-to-cost relationship. However, given the subjective nature of the 'satisfaction' metric used in its calculation, the process of formulating the Value Index for the different product functions is a complex matter.
   In this paper, a novel expert system is described for evaluating and selecting design alternatives based on the development of a new methodology for calculating the Value Index factor. The system takes into account efficient management of the uncertainty inherent in the operations by using two concurrent fuzzy-inference processes. The first of these processes manages the determination of the Value Index factor, while the second calculates the Perceived Value factor, a term associated with the risk derived from not modifying the initial parameters in the calculation of the Value Index itself. An autonomous decision system is thus obtained that not only evaluates, selects and recommends the best design alternative, but which also determines the strength of the selection.
   In addition to the description of this system, a case study is presented that shows the potential benefits obtained from the new methods thus developed. These methods make it possible to improve the use of Value Indices as decision factors in the design process and also to provide new perspectives on the selection of alternatives in the context of Value Methodologies.

AB This article presents a new version of the redundancy allocation problem with mixed components (RAPMC) considering the component sequence because it severely affects the reliability of a standby redundant system. It provides a system configuration with exceedingly higher reliability than existing RAPs under same constraints. However, its solution space is significantly expanded according to the number of candidate types and the scale of the system, and thus this study proposed a parallel genetic algorithm with a knowledge base (PGAKB) to efficiently solve it. It includes two strategies, which are the emulation of an expert system and the cooperation between GAs. An individual of the PGAKB creates and exploits the knowledge of the society, and the accumulated knowledge is used for the local search, the final stage for the PGAKB. In conclusion, for solving a complex optimization problem, the PGAKB operates in the form of an expert system and describes a society developing itself by accumulating knowledge. Furthermore, regarding the quality and robustness of solutions and computational time, the effectiveness of the PGAKB was analytically demonstrated by experiments on a famous example.

AB In the real world, scheduling is usually performed under dynamic conditions, which means that it is not known when new jobs will be released into the system. Therefore, the procedure which is used to create the schedule must be able to adapt to the changing conditions during the execution of the system. In dynamic conditions, dispatching rules are one of the most commonly used methods for creating the schedules. Throughout the years, various dispatching rules were defined for a wide range of scheduling criteria. However, in most cases when a new dispatching rule is proposed, it is usually tested on only one or two scheduling criteria, and compared with only a few other dispatching rules. Furthermore, there are also no recent studies which compare all the different dispatching rules with each other. Therefore, it is difficult to determine how certain dispatching rules perform on different scheduling criteria and problem types. The objective of this study was to collect a large number of dispatching rules from the literature for the unrelated machines environment, and test them on nine scheduling criteria and four problem types with various machine and job heterogeneities. For each of the tested dispatching rules it will be outlined in which situations it achieves the best results, as well as which dispatching rules are best suited for solving each of the tested scheduling criteria.

AB Precipitation behavior of Z-phase (NbCrN) is investigated in 25Cr-20Ni-Nb-N austenitic stainless steel during long-term aging. The early precipitation of secondary NbN appears when the steel is aged for 100 h, and the secondary NbCrN precipitates adhere to the pre-existing NbN particles during the subsequent aging. A semi-coherent relation between (1 1 1)(NbN) and (1 1 2)(NbCrN) is identified, which provides favorable sites for the nucleation of secondary NbCrN on secondary NbN. Subsequently, secondary NbN will dissolve to supply niobium and nitrogen for the growth of secondary NbCrN. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of High Pressure Torsion (HPT) deformation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a corrosion-resistant, low modulus Zr-Ti-Nb alloy, obtained by vacuum sintering of cold pressed powder are studied. It is shown that HPT treatment leads to the following effects: elimination of the residual chemical heterogeneity of the alloy, significant reduction of the porosity of the material and the pore size and improvement of mechanical properties. The phase composition of the alloy does not change during processing. The results show the potential of the HPT method for the production of alloys with a favorable combination of properties.

AB Thin and thick specimens were isothermally oxidized. The use of different thick specimen allowed the change of the intrinsic defect structure in thermally grown chromia scales independently from the test gas. Oxidation kinetics and micro-structure of scales formed were followed. Oxide cross-sections were analysed to determine oxide thickness and grain width. Chromia scales formed on the various substrates grew at different rates and oxide microstructures differed in grain shape and size. The chromia growth kinetics was found to be depending on the thickness of the specimens used, the gas H2O content, and the Ni alloy content. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel method of silicon carbide growth on silicon substrates is proposed. The method makes use of carbon recoil atoms implantation from a layer of molecules of carbon-containing gas, adsorbed on a cooled silicon surface bombarded by argon ions. A silicon carbide film is formed on the surface of a Si(1 1 1) substrate after high-temperature annealing in vacuum. The film properties are studied by IR-spectroscopy, XRD, AFM and optical microscopy methods. The studies have shown that the proposed method enables the growth of single-crystalline SiC films on the Si crystal surface. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the conductive conjugated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/graphene (G) composite nanofibers were fabricated by a facile electrospinning successfully. The processing technique demonstrated that the insitu crosslinking nanofibers were hollow structures by using an ultrasonication treatment for G nanosheets (approximate to 3.5 nm) due to the effect of solution viscosity (PVA-G concentration). Hereby, very few studies have been performed the characterization of the hollow nanofibers by PVA-G processing. The electrical conductivity and specific surface area of composite nanofibers resulted in significant effects on the viscosity of the reaction mixture for the electrospinning process, which can possibly open up the new emerging sensing themes and applications.

AB Co38Ni35Al27 and Co35Zn10Ni32Al23 ferromagnetic shape memory alloys were prepared via facile powder metallurgy and vacuum sintering technique. The influence of sintering temperature on phase transformation behaviour, microstructure and magnetic properties were investigated. The rise in peak intensity of A2-phase shows that the alloy is rich in martensitic-phase in the polycrystalline cubic B2-phase structure and Zn incorporation leads to the reduction in austenite-phase. The needle-shaped cobalt precipitates on predominant martensite A2-phase, shows Widmanstatten-like structure in the samples sintered at 673 K. The saturation magnetization was found to be 87.92 and 96.2 emu/g for Co38Ni35Al27 and Co35Zn10Ni32Al23 alloy. The existence of non-interacting single-domain particles were observed and proved using Stoner-Wohlfarth model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Nanoparticles; Phase transformation; Shape memory materials
AB The superelastic response of the Fe43.5Mn34Al15Ni7.5 single crystalline shape memory alloy, oriented along the  1 2 2  direction was investigated. The quenched single crystals demonstrated superelastic strains of 4.0% in tension and 2.0% in compression. Ageing at 200 degrees C for 3 h led to the suppression of superelasticity in compression. An asymmetry in the tension and compression properties, probably associated with the ability of the martensite crystals to detwin under stress, was detected. It is likely that the detwinning of gamma'-martensite in compression leads to an increase in the mechanical hysteresis Delta sigma and the stresses sigma(cr) required for the onset of strain associated with the stress-induced martensitic transformation in quenched crystals, suppressing superelasticity in the aged crystals. Tension without the detwinning of gamma'-martensite result in a weak influence of coherent B2 (bcc/NiAl) precipitates on the mechanical hysteresis Delta sigma. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The as-prepared La2O3 film has low surface free energy and a large initial contact angle (CA), about 120 degrees. Due to the uniform distribution of the urchin-like nanosphere on the surface, the water droplet starts to be adsorbed into the interspace of film surface, and the wetting state gradually transforms from Cassie to Wenzel state as soon as the low voltage less than 1 V is applied. Obviously, the DC EWOD response with superlow voltage can be realized, and large CA modulation about 58 degrees is also acquired. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB This study experimentally investigates the effects of barely visible impact damage (BVID) under low-velocity impact and its influence on post-impact residual flexural properties of hybrid flax-basalt Eco-composites Fibri Rock -Aero of 2 and 4 mm in thickness using drop weight impact and 3-point bending tests. The damage-induced was characterised by X-ray micro computed tomography (X-ray mu CT) technique. The results show that the post-impact residual flexural strength (PI-RFS) and modulus of the composites are dependent on their thickness and incident impact energies employed. A significant damage was evident for both types of specimens caused by microscopic inter-laminar delamination and cracks induced especially at the highest incident energy with a noticeable reduction on PI-RFS and modulus.

AB Nanocrystalline Zn-Ni alloy is easily to be oxidized after exposed in the air, and the formed locally oxidized film can provide an additionally novel photocathodic protection to the bare grain surface under sunlight illumination in simulated seawater. A much lower corrosion rate of nearly 30% is obtained for locally oxidized nanocrystalline Zn-Ni alloy under sunlight condition compared to the dark condition. The anticorrosion mechanism is achieved by cooperating following two mechanisms: photocathodic protection of photoelectrons on the reaction of zinc oxidation, and shielding effect of the formed new zinc based precipitation under sunlight illumination. This is a simple and economical approach with the promise for large-scale application in enhancing corrosion resistance of Zn-Ni alloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amorphous iron phosphate dihydrate (FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O) nanoplates have been for the first time prepared via liquid exfoliation method. The nanoplates were exfoliated from the diethylamine-modified FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O that were sourced from recycled steelmaking slag. The obtained nanoplates feature in an average lateral size of 46.76 nm and transversal size of 31.62 nm with an average thickness of 30.4 nm. The amorphous structure was confirmed by material characterisation. The work provides a facile approach to obtain nanostructured iron phosphate that can be beneficial for the applications in energy storage devices and nano-fertilisers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID GRAIN; DEFORMATION; VARIANT
AB Effect of boundary (beta/beta and alpha/beta boundary) on the alpha phase precipitation in a near-alpha titanium alloy had been statistically investigated. The result shows that most grain boundary alpha(GB alpha) precipitates maintain a Burgers orientation relationship (BOR) with one of adjacent prior beta grains. However, in some unique cases, the GB alpha did not maintain a BOR with either prior beta grains due to preferential growth of equiaxed primary alpha (alpha(p)). It was also observed that the low-angle beta/beta boundaries can be passed through by secondary alpha (alpha(s)). Additionally, when an alpha(p) grain and an adjacent beta grain have a near BOR, the preferred as may form at alpha(p)/beta boundary with the similar orientation to the alpha(p) due to low interfacial energy of low-angle alpha(p)/alpha(s) boundary.

AB Alkali metal molybdates have been demonstrated as promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries due to high specific capacity. In this study, Li2MoO4@C has been prepared by oxalic acid-assisted sol-gel method followed by carbon coating. Thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scan electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope were employed to characterize its composition, structure and morphology. Electrochemical measurements show that the porous Li2MoO4@C composite displays excellent electrochemical performances. The initial lithiation and delithiation specific capacity was 983 mAh g(-1) and 653 mAh g(-1) at current density of 100 mA g(-1), respectively. The electrode delivers 504 mAh g(-1) delithiation capacities even though undergoing 150 cycles test. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of B on microstructure, tensile properties, fracture behavior and phase transformation in 13% Mn metastable austenitic steels were systemically investigated. B addition increased the yield strength for the existence of hard borides, but reduced the total elongation because of different fracture mechanisms caused by the brittle borides. Microstructural analysis indicated that the excellent mechanical properties were the results of the combination of transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) and twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) effects. Meanwhile, the highly concentrated stress at the ends of cracked borides induced the transformation from austenite to martensite and a large amount of austenite were consumed by this way, which led to the earlier occurrence of fracture.

AB A double-switching-voltage phenomenon was found in traditional electrospinning with an auxiliary needle electrode where multiple jets (>= 2) only appeared between two threshold voltages. The effects of the double-switching voltage and other electrospinning parameters on the jet number were investigated. The number of jets increased as the increase of voltage, while the distances between the jets were found to be decreased with the increase of jet number. A possible interpretation of double-switching voltage formation was provided according to the theoretical analysis and finite element analysis of the electric field. Our results could provide the underlying insights needed to guide the design of electrospinning with enhanced throughput. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sensory evaluation in a basic taste recombinant revealed taste modulating thresholds for the octadecadien-12-ynoic acids in the range of 19-105 mu mol/l. In comparison, three isolated octadecadienoic acids, namely (10E, 14Z)-12-hydroxy-10,14-octadecadienoic acid, (9Z, 11Z)-14,18-dihydroxy9,11-octadecadienoic acid, and (9Z, 11Z)-14,17,18-trihydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid, respectively, did not show any taste modulating activity, thus pinpointing the putative key role of the acetylene moiety for kokumi enhancement.

AB A selective and sensitive procedure for determining seven hazardous microcystins in Margarya melanioides, using tandem mass spectrometry, is presented. The product ion m/z 135.2 was selected as representative for precursor ion scanning and used to increase overall sensitivity of this shotgun method. The method was validated, and recoveries ranged from 69.3 to 87.9%, with the relative standard deviation less than 10%. Limits of detection and quantitation were less than 3.1 and 9.3 ng.mL(-1), respectively. A total of 60 samples were tested using this method. 38 samples were found to be contaminated with microcystins, among which there are 31 samples whose estimated daily intake (EDI) was 0-7.8 times higher than the tolerable daily intake (TDI). This method would be useful for carrying out direct, ultra-rapid quantification of microcystins in foods, and is of significant interest for environmental and food safety applications.

AB This work aimed to investigate the evolution of phenolic compounds and elements during the aging of Malbec red wines from different regions of Mendoza (Argentina) and California (United States). The profiles of low molecular weight polyphenols and anthocyanins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD), and the elemental composition using microwave plasma-Atomic emission spectrometry (MP-AES). Through uni- and multivariate statistical analyses, the effects of aging time and region on wine were investigated. It was observed that aging time was a significant factor that affected the phenolic compound profile in the studied Malbec wines studied and that after five years of aging, the wines could be differentiated according to region. The results of this study may impact decisions made regarding the storage of Malbec wines in the future.

AB Great Northern beans (GNB) contain appreciable magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), and iron (Fe), together with the heat-labile vitamin, folate, and the anti-nutritional compound phytate. Thus, the objective was to increase dialyzability of essential mineral elements while degrading phytate and minimizing destruction of folate through extrusion of GNB. Extrusion resulted in significant (p < 0.05) increases in dialyzability of Mg, P, K, and Fe by as much as 50%, 30%, 5%, and 79%, respectively, while decreasing cadmium (Cd) dialyzability. Screw speed (SS) had a significant quadratic effect on dialyzability of all elements. Low MC resulted in a significant reduction (46%) in phytate, although this was accompanied by as much as 24% destruction of folate. In conclusion, low barrel temperature, medium MC and high SS were identified as the optimum conditions to maximize essential mineral element dialyzability and folate retention while minimizing phytate and dialyzable Cd.

AB The dissipations and residues of four pesticides in citrus, under field conditions, were measured using solid-phase extraction and LC-MS/MS. In the method validation, satisfactory results were obtained with fortified recoveries ranging from 80.6 to 113% and relative standard deviations <= 9.0%. In the dissipation test, the half-lives for the pesticides in citrus, according to first-order kinetics, ranged from 13.3 to 28.9 days. Based on the terminal residue test, two evaluation models (hazard quotient, HQ; risk quotient, RQ) were applied on citrus fruits for dietary exposure risk assessment. The results showed that HQs ranged from 0.0031 to 0.78%, and RQs from 7.3 to 57%, which are both acceptable for human consumption. Therefore, 14-day was proposed as a pre-harvest interval for the target compounds in citrus fruits. This work also contributes to residue data and, therefore, scientifically validated maximum residue limits in citrus, which are lacking in China currently.

AB The phenolic profile and antioxidant activity (AOX) of "organic vs. conventional" Brazilian wines and grape juices were analyzed. A simple method for the determination of minerals Cu, Fe and Mn by F-AAS was validated and used to characterize the samples studied. In the validation of the Cu, Fe and Mn determination method, the protocol for samples preparation by hot digestion with HNO3 + H2O2 proved to be more suitable for the grape juice and wine matrices. The validation parameters were considered satisfactory. Conventional products presented higher anthocyanins content, and no significant differences were observed on other phenolic compounds, AOX and Cu, Fe and Mn minerals. All the evaluated samples presented similar results between the same cultivars and in products from grapes of the two cultivation systems. The AOX of juices and wines, organic and conventional, was high, and correlated with procyanidin B1, petunidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside.

AB Although paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) have traditionally been analyzed by liquid chromatography with either pre-or post-column derivatization, and these methods have been validated successfully through inter-laboratory studies, mass spectrometry methods have also been described in literature for use in monitoring programs. However, methods using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) need to be improved in terms of sensitivity, analyte recovery and retention time stability because of undesirable matrix effects. Furthermore, tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been found in northern European bivalves, so it is important to analyze TTX compounds alongside PSTs because characteristics of their toxicity are similar. This paper describes, for the first time, a chemical method that allows determination of PSTs, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, alongside TTX and its analogue 4,9-anhydro tetrodotoxin (4,9-anhTTX) with LC-MS/MS using a Hypercarb (R) column. The method was validated for 13 hydrophilic PSTs and TTXs and was able to discriminate six hydrophobic PSTs in 20 min. The method was developed for four shellfish matrices: mussel (Mytillus galloprovincialis), clam (Ruditapes decussatus), scallop (Pecten maximus) and oyster (Ostrae edulis). Clean-up procedure used in this work allowed us to obtain good results for validation parameters for both PSTs and TTXs. No standards were available so strains of Gymnodinium catenatum (G. catenatum) were used instead.

AB This study determined the effects of germination on the minerals, fatty acids, pasting, thermal, rheological and phytocomponents contents of Chenopodium album flour. The predominant fatty acids in raw flour were palmitic (0.83%), oleic (0.99%) and linoleic acids (1.96%), which increased significantly (p=0.05) with germination. Minerals (Na, Cu and Zn) and dietary fiber (soluble and insoluble) were increased with germination, while pasting and gelatinization properties were reduced significantly. Scanning electron micrographs showed destruction of the continuous composite structure of starch embedded in the dense protein matrix of flour following germination. Quantitative analysis of C. album flour by GC-MS revealed that germinated flour contained more phytocompounds than raw flour. This research suggests the potential of germination in enhanced product development and utilization of valuable bioactive compounds.

AB To control discoloration of dried Japanese common squid (Todarodes pacificus) product, influence of 0-1% organic salts, including sodium gluconate (Na-gluconate), sodium citrate (Na-citrate), sodium phytate (Na-phytate), sodium benzoate (Na-benzoate) and sodium tartrate (Na-tartrate), on Maillard browning in the squid meat during air-drying was investigated. Changes in surface color of the dried squid were mitigated by the addition of organic salts. Organic salts also showed inhibitory effects on autolysis and generation of free amino acids (FAAs), especially arginine, in both the dried squid meat and the model solution. Moreover, Maillard reaction degree of the dried squid was decreased by using organic salts. The addition of 1% Na-citrate or 1% Na-phytate well suppressed the browning of the dried squid (p < 0.05). The results indicated that organic salts having strong chelating ability, including Na-citrate and Na-phytate, can prevent the browning of the dried squid product by inhibiting the generation of FAAs.

AB The aim of this study was to characterize whey proteins and their potential activities among buffalo breeds. In this work, a tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic approach was used to identify the differences in the proteomes of milk whey proteins in Murrah, Nili-Ravi and Mediterranean buffaloes. A total of 580 proteins were identified in buffalo milk whey, and the subunits of the 62 differentially expressed proteins are shown in clustering analysis. Whey proteins with relatively higher levels in Mediterranean buffalo milk than in Murrah and Nili-Ravi buffalo milk included polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, alpha 1-antiproteinase, heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein, and Acyl-CoA-binding protein. Most of the differentially expressed proteins participate in complement and coagulation cascades, which are strongly related to immune protective activities. These results provide insight into the complexity of the buffalo milk whey proteome and provide molecular evidence for nutritive differences among buffalo breeds.

AB The crystallinity is of importance for in vitro digestibility of starch. Six chestnut cultivars were selected to study the relationship between the crystallinity and in vitro digestibility of chestnut starch during thermal processing. After heat treatment, the total starch and amylose content remained unchanged or decreased, but the amount of damaged starch increased significantly (P < 0.05). Thermal processing enhanced the short-range ordered structure of starch and reduced its relative crystallinity. Thermal processing also decreased the resistant starch (RS) content, but a high RS content (57.2-67.9% of total starch) still remained in cooked chestnut starch. The relative crystallinity was negatively correlated with the estimated glycemic index (eGI) (r = -0.6416), and positively correlated with RS content (r = 0.6189). Accordingly, by altering the relative crystallinity and damage degree of chestnut starch, thermal processing changed the overall starch fractions and eGI, which can affect the overall in vitro digestibility.

AB Thermal liquefying of crystallised honey is the most convenient option for beekeepers to fully liquefy honey. A controlled mild thermal treatment is widely used for effective and safe liquefying of crystallised honey.
   In this study, we demonstrated that thermal liquefying at different temperatures of 45, 55 and 65 degrees C does not affect the overall honey antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and, in some cases, it may even increase the antibacterial potential of honey. A mild thermal treatment of crystallised honey was able to significantly increase its glucose oxidase (GOX) enzyme activity. On the other hand, the increased GOX activity in treated honey samples did not affect levels of accumulated H2O2, suggesting that some phytochemicals may contribute to or modulate antibacterial activity.
   Taken together, a mild thermal liquefaction of crystallised honey may increase the potential bioactivity of this matrix, which is also affected by the botanical origin.

AB Furan, which has been identified as a carcinogenic risk for humans, can be induced in different foods by UV-C light. In this study, we hypothesized that furan was produced by a UV light-induced free radical mechanism and antioxidants could suppress its formation. Our results demonstrated that, by adding antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxyl toluene, ascorbic acid or gallic acid, to simulated juice or apple cider during UV-C treatment, amounts of furan were significantly reduced. For example, the concentration of furan produced in apple cider by UV-C at 9.0 J/cm(2) was 636 ppb but was less than 20 ppb with 0.25 ppm butylated hydroxyl toluene present, less than 3 ppb with 0.5% (w/v) ascorbic acid, and less than 1.0 ppb with 0.5% (w/v) gallic acid. These findings confirmed that antioxidants can be used as a safe and simple mitigation measure to control furan production in fruit drinks exposed to UV-light.

AB Beef M. longissimus lumborum (LL) and M. psoas major (PM) muscles showed significant differences in various meat quality attributes (such as pH, lipid oxidation, and color stability). To better understand the underlying molecular variations between LL and PM, the proteome changes at early postmortem periods were investigated by comparative proteomic approach. A total of 504, 519, and 487 mutual proteins of each comparison (LL vs. PM at 1 h, 12 h, and 24 h, respectively) were successfully identified. Among these proteins, 238 proteins were differentially expressed in LL samples compared to PM ones. Proteins involved in glycolysis and with functions of protection and repair were overabundant in LL, whereas those participating in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid beta-oxidation were overabundant in PM. Furthermore, the bioinformatics analyses provided insightful information for explaining the differences in meat quality traits between LL and PM, and for further metabolomics studies.

AB The ridgetail white prawn (Exopalaemon carinicauda) is an important economic species in China. In order to know the molecular basis and evaluate the potential nutrition value of a new variety of this species with orangered color, the main carotenoid pigments were extracted and identified through high performance liquid chromatography. It showed that higher concentration of free astaxanthin existed in the new variety which might cause the color variation. The concentration of total astaxanthin in muscle and waste of the new variety was 3.3 and 1.9 fold higher than that in natural prawn under the same culture condition (P < 0.05). The predominant geometric and optical isomers of astaxanthin in muscle of the new variety were identified as all-trans and 3S, 3'S astaxanthin. This is the first report of astaxanthin-enriched E. carinicauda, which also provides an alternative source of natural astaxanthin and the possibility for improving the nutrition value in this species.

AB Germination is an effective biofortification strategy to enhance micronutrients of staple grains. The current study targeted at comparing the effects of normoxia and hypoxia on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content and the componential changes underlying the technofunctionality of germinated wheat. Compared with ungerminated wheat, GABA maximumly enhanced by 88.73% and 50.70% in hypoxia-and normoxia-germinated wheat (HGW and NGW), respectively. Hypoxia suppressed the germination degree of wheat, which better preserved the technofunctionality. Compared with NGW, the proteolytic and alpha-amylase activities were partially inhibited for HGW, resulting in higher protein and starch content. The diminishment of gluten marcopolymers and soluble high-molecular-weight proteins, and conversion of alpha-helices to beta-turns were alleviated in HGW, which contributed to the more viscoelastic dough. Meanwhile, superior pasting and gelation properties were mainly due to suppressed alpha-amylase activity and more starch content in HGW. The results suggested that HGW flour can be exploited as a functional staple ingredient.

AB Analytical methods are needed for the identification and quantification of meat species to detect food adulteration. Since game meat is more expensive than meat from domesticated animal species, it is a potential target for adulteration. We present a tetraplex real-time PCR assay that allows the simultaneous determination of the content of roe deer, red deer, fallow deer and sika deer. The tetraplex assay showed only moderate cross-reactivity with closely related species. After optimization the tetraplex assay had a limit of detection of 0.1% (w/w) and a limit of quantification of 0.5% (w/w) for each of the four deer species. The tetraplex assay was found to be robust, slight modifications of the experimental setup did not lower its performance. Recoveries obtained by analyzing DNA mixtures and DNA isolates from model game sausages were similar to those obtained with the singleplex assays.

AB A kinetic model for a high-intensity ultrasound-assisted Maillard reaction model system of D-glucose and glycine was proposed; activation energy (Ea) for each reaction step was calculated. Results showed that the generation of dicarbonyl compounds was significantly promoted by high-intensity ultrasound (e.g. Ea values for 1-deoxyglucosone were 60.9 +/- 9.7 kJ mol(-1) and 105.5 +/- 9.9 kJ mol(-1) in ultrasonic and thermal Maillard reaction, respectively), which resulted in a significantly higher concentration of colored and volatile Maillard reaction products generated in ultrasound-assisted Maillard reaction compared with that in thermal Maillard reaction. However, as a competitive reaction, the isomerization of D-glucose was suppressed and required significantly higher Ea values in ultrasound-assisted Maillard reaction (100.8 +/- 6.2 kJ mol(-1)) compared with that in thermal Maillard reaction (84.2 +/- 5.7 kJ mol(-1)). These finding may be attributed to an extremely high temperature and pressure environment, despite of being only momentarily, generated by high-intensity ultrasound.

AB This work describes a TLC-coupled bioautographic assay suitable for the separation and detection of apple polyphenol oxidase (PPO) inhibitors from natural extracts. PPO was immobilised in agar containing L-DOPA as substrate and 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH) to enhance colour development. The inhibition was detected as white spots on reddish background. Minimum amount of PPO inhibitors detected was 0.0125 mu g of 4-hexylresorcinol, 0.025 mu g of ascorbic acid, 0.5 mu g of cysteine and 1 mu g of kojic acid. The assay was compatible with normal and reverse phase TLC systems and allows detecting compounds that directly had action on the enzyme as well as agents that could convert quinones back to their reduced form. The chromatographic run evidenced the different nature of enzymatic browning inhibitory compounds from garlic and onion extracts. Using natural enzymes will provide a fast and cheap alternative for target specific exploration of natural enzymatic inhibitors.

AB Background: The high burden of rotavirus acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is well documented among children under 5 years of age, with the majority of mortality occurring in developing countries. Nigeria ranked second worldwide in the number of rotavirus deaths in 2013. As Nigeria plans to introduce rotavirus vaccine soon, a pre-vaccine documentation of rotavirus disease burden is necessary to determine vaccine impact.
   Methods: Routine rotavirus surveillance was conducted during 2011-2016 in 3 sentinel sites in Nigeria using the standard WHO protocol. Children under 5 years of age hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis were enrolled and demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected. A stool sample was subsequently obtained and tested for human rotavirus antigen using the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: 2694 children with acute gastroenteritis were enrolled during January 2011 to December 2016; of these, 1242 (46%) tested positive for rotavirus. Among the rotavirus positive cases, 66% and 94% were younger than 12 months and 24 months respectively. Marked peaks in rotavirus positivity were seen in January of each year. Vomiting, and use of oral and intravenous fluids occurred more often in rotavirus positive cases as compared to rotavirus negative cases.
   Conclusion: The high prevalence of rotavirus disease highlights the need for urgent introduction of rota virus vaccine in Nigeria. Additionally, this study provides pre-vaccine introduction disease-burden data that will serve as a baseline for rotavirus vaccine impact-assessment once vaccine has been introduced in the national immunization program.

AB Background: Rotavirus gastroenteritis is estimated to cause approximately five thousand deaths annually among Afghan children under 5 years old. Because laboratory confirmation of rotavirus is not routinely performed in clinical settings, assessing the precise burden of disease attributable to severe rotavirus gastroenteritis typically requires active surveillance efforts. This study describes the current burden of pediatric hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus gastroenteritis among Afghan children using surveillance data collected from 2013 to 2015.
   Methods: Rotavirus surveillance was conducted from January 2013 through December 2015 at two of the largest hospitals in the country, Indira Gandhi Children Hospital in Kabul and Herat Regional Hospital. Children between 1 and 60 months of age who were admitted to these hospitals for diarrhea were consented and enrolled. Information on age, gender, and seasonality were collected. Stool specimens were collected and tested by enzyme immunoassay for the presence of rotavirus at the central public health laboratory in Afghanistan.
   Results: Overall, 1,413 of 2,737 (52%) of hospitalized children under five years old with diarrhea were rotavirus cases. The overwhelming majority of rotavirus hospitalizations occurred in children younger than two years of age (93%) while 42% of all rotavirus hospitalizations occurred in children between 6 and 11 months of age. Rotavirus transmission occurred year-round.
   Conclusions: Rotavirus is a major cause of severe acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations in young Afghan children, responsible for over half of diarrheal hospitalizations in this population. The Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health has prioritized reducing child mortality by 2020 and is actively working towards the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in Afghan children. These data will be instrumental in understanding the potential impact upon child health that may be achieved through the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in Afghanistan. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Despite progress made in child survival in the past 20 years, 5.9 million children under five years died in 2015, with 9% of these deaths due to diarrhea. Rotavirus is responsible for more than a third of diarrhea deaths. In 2013, rotavirus was estimated to cause 215,000 deaths among children under five years, including 89,000 in Asia. As of April 2017, 92 countries worldwide have introduced rotavirus vaccination in their national immunization program. Afghanistan has applied for Gavi support to introduce rotavirus vaccination nationally. This study estimates the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of a national rotavirus immunization program in Afghanistan.
   Methods: This study examined the use of Rotarix (RV1) administered using a two-dose schedule at 6 and 10 weeks of age. We used the ProVac Initiative's UNIVAC model (version 1.2.09) to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of a rotavirus vaccine program compared with no vaccine over ten birth cohorts from 2017 to 2026 with a 3% annual discount rate. All monetary units are adjusted to 2017 US$.
   Results: Rotavirus vaccination in Afghanistan has the potential to avert more than one million cases; 660,000 outpatient visits; approximately 50,000 hospital admissions; 650,000 DALYs; and 12,000 deaths, over 10 years. Not accounting for any Gavi subsidy, rotavirus vaccination can avert DALYs at US$82/DALY from the government perspective and US$80/DALY from the societal perspective. With Gavi support, DALYs can be averted at US$29/DALY and US$31 /DALY from the societal and government perspective, respectively. The average yearly cost of a rotavirus vaccination program would represent 2.8% of the total immunization budget expected in 2017 and 0.1% of total health expenditure.
   Conclusion: The introduction of rotavirus vaccination would be highly cost-effective in Afghanistan, and even more so with a Gavi subsidy. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

AB Background: Rotavirus vaccination introduction in routine immunization is under consideration in Pakistan. Data on the baseline epidemiology of intussusception will inform surveillance strategies for intussusception after rotavirus vaccine introduction in Pakistan. We describe the epidemiology of intussusception-associated hospitalizations among children <2 years of age in Karachi, Pakistan.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review for July 01, 2012 through June 30, 2015 at the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) and Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) Karachi. At AKUH, the International Classification of Disease, ninth revision, code 560.0 for intussusception was used to retrieve intussusception case records. At NICH, daily Operation Theater, Emergency Room, and surgical daycare log sheets and surgical ward census sheets were used to identify cases. Records of children who fulfilled eligibility criteria and the Brighton Collaboration level one case definition of intussusception were selected for data analysis. We used structured case report forms to extract data for the descriptive analysis.
   Results: We identified 158 cases of confirmed intussusception; 30 cases (19%) were from AKUH. More than half (53%) of the cases occurred in children aged 6-12 months, followed by 35% among those aged <6 months. Two-thirds (106/158) of the cases were male. The most common presenting complaints were vomiting and bloody stool. At NICH, almost all (93%) were managed surgically, while at AKUH, 57% of the cases were managed with enemas. Three deaths occurred, all from NICH. Cases occurred without any seasonality. At NICH, 4% (128/3618) of surgical admissions among children aged <2 years were attributed to intussusception, while that for AKUH was 2% (30/1702).
   Conclusion: In this chart review, intussusception predominantly affected children 0-6 months of age and occurred more commonly in males. This information on the baseline epidemiology of intussusception will inform post-vaccine introduction adverse event monitoring related to intussusception in Pakistan. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Globally, rotavirus is a leading cause of childhood diarrhea and related mortality. Although rotavirus vaccination has been introduced in many countries worldwide, there are numerous low-to middle-income countries that have not yet introduced. Pakistan is one of the countries with the highest number of rota virus deaths in children under five years. Although rotavirus infection is almost universal among children, mortality is often a result of poor nutrition and lack of access to health care and other aspects of poverty. We assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing childhood rotavirus vaccination in Pakistan. We use household data from the 2012-2013 Demographic Health survey in Pakistan to estimate heterogeneity in rotavirus mortality risk, vaccination benefits, and cost-effectiveness across geographic and economic groups. We estimate two-dose rotavirus vaccination coverage that would be distributed through a routine vaccination program. In addition, we estimate rotavirus mortality (burden), and other measures of vaccine cost-effectiveness and impact by subpopulations of children aggregated by region and economic status. Results indicate that the highest estimated regional rotavirus burden is in Sindh (3.3 rota virus deaths/1000 births) and Balochistan (3.1 rotavirus deaths/1000 births), which also have the lowest estimated vaccination coverage, particularly for children living in the poorest households. In Pakistan, introduction could prevent 3061 deaths per year with current routine immunization patterns at an estimated $279/DALY averted. Increases in coverage to match the region with highest coverage (Islamabad) could prevent an additional 1648 deaths per year. Vaccination of children in the highest risk regions could result in a fourfold mortality reduction as compared to low risk children, and children in the poorest households have a three to four times greater mortality reduction benefit than the richest. Based on the analysis presented here, the benefits and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination can be maximized by reaching economically and geographically vulnerable children.

AB Introduction: Rotavirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and mortality among children worldwide but data describing rotavirus disease in Azerbaijan are lacking. This analysis describes the rotavirus disease burden in Baku, the largest city in Azerbaijan.
   Methods: We conducted active, prospective, sentinel hospital surveillance with laboratory confirmation for rotavirus among children under 5 years of age hospitalized at a large pediatric hospital in Baku during 2011-2016. Children with bloody diarrhea, or prior use of antibiotics or intravenous fluids were excluded. The guardians of enrolled children completed a questionnaire documenting clinical and demographic information. A stool specimen was collected from each enrolled child. We report the number and proportion of rotavirus positive hospitalizations during the surveillance period and a clinical description of rotavirus-positive and rotavirus-negative children.
   Results: From July 2011 through June 2016, 3139 children <5 years of age were enrolled into the surveillance system. Of these, 523 (17%) were positive for rotavirus, varying from 13% to 21% by surveillance year, with a median of 16% over the surveillance period. Increase in rotavirus detections occurred during December-May. Most rotavirus infections (303/523; 58%) occurred in children aged 6-23 months.
   Conclusion: Rotavirus is responsible for approximately 16% of annual hospital admissions for acute gastroenteritis in children <5 years of age in Baku. This is lower than regional estimates. Exclusion of children with a history of antibiotic use or intravenous fluids may be accounting for this lower prevalence, and expansion of surveillance to include these groups could provide a more comprehensive picture of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis in Baku.

ID VACCINE; EFFICACY; SAFETY
AB Background: In January 2015, Tajikistan introduced the monovalent rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization program. Our objective was to estimate pre-vaccine burden of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations in children <5 years of age in Tajikistan.
   Methods: During January 2013-December 2014, active surveillance for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) associated hospitalizations in children <5 years of age was conducted by sentinel surveillance site staff. Patients' demographic and clinical data were summarized and a stool sample was collected. An Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay was used for diagnosis of rotavirus infection and subset of the specimens was sent for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping.
   Results: Of 2860 eligible children enrolled and tested, 1207 (42%) were positive for rotavirus. An increase in the number and proportion of rotavirus cases attributed to rotavirus season, with positivity rates >40%, was annually observed during June-September.
   The median age of rotavirus patients was 9 months and 939/1207 (78%) rotavirus patients were aged 623 months. Most (1097/1203; 91%) rotavirus patients were treated with intravenous fluids. GIP[8] was the predominant genotype during both years of surveillance, accounting for 133/222 (60%) of genotyped cases.
   Conclusion: Rotavirus is a major cause of hospitalization due to severe AGE in children <5 years of age in Tajikistan, accounting for >40% of cases. Continued, enhanced rotavirus surveillance may allow documentation of changes in rotavirus disease burden following vaccine introduction and assessment of vaccine effectiveness.

AB Background: Acute gastroenteritis remains a burden among children under 5 years of age. Ukraine joined the World Health Organization's Global Rotavirus Surveillance Network in 2006, with a goal of providing accurate rotavirus burden data to aid policy makers in planning for rotavirus vaccine introduction. This analysis describes rotavirus epidemiology among Ukrainian children enrolled in Kyiv and Odesa, two large Ukrainian cities.
   Methods: Children 0-59 months of age hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis at 2 sentinel sites in Kyiv and Odesa were enrolled into the active, prospective surveillance program. In Odesa, the surveillance period was during 2007-2015 and in Kyiv, it was during 2011-2015. Acute gastroenteritis was defined as 3 or more episodes of diarrhea per day during a 24 h period, with symptom duration before hospitalization not exceeding 7 days. Guardians of enrolled children completed a questionnaire including demographic, clinical and treatment information. Each child provided a stool specimen within 2 days of hospitalization. Stools were tested for rotavirus using ProSpecrm Rotavirus Kit (Oxoid Ltd., Great Britain), and positive specimens were genotyped. Descriptive data are reported, as well as comparison of demographic, clinical and treatment data among rotavirus positive and negative children.
   Results: During July 2007-June 2015, 12,350 children were enrolled in the surveillance programs and had stool specimens collected and tested for rotavirus. Overall, rotavirus infection was diagnosed in 5412/12350 (44%) of children, 929/1734 (54%) of those in Kyiv and 4483/10616 (42%) in Odesa. Rotavirus infections peaked during the winter months. Children with rotavirus acute gastroenteritis displayed more severe clinical symptoms than those without rotavirus. Predominant genotypes identified included G1 P[8], G2P[4], G3 P[8], G4 P[8] and G9 P[8].
   Conclusion: Active surveillance of acute gastroenteritis in hospitalized children younger 5 years in two large Ukrainian cities reveals a significant burden of rotavirus infection. These data provide scientific justification for incorporating rotavirus vaccines into the Ukrainian national immunization schedule. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Rotavirus vaccines have significantly decreased the burden of diarrheal diseases in countries that have introduced them into their immunization programs. In some studies, there has been a small association between rotavirus vaccines and intussusception in post-marketing surveillance, highlighting the importance of tracking incidence before and after vaccine introduction. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of intussusception among Bangladeshi children pre-vaccine introduction.
   Methods: We conducted active, hospital-based surveillance for intussusception at 7 tertiary care hospitals with pediatric surgical facilities during July 2012 to September 2016. Hospitalized children under 2 years of age were identified according to Brighton Collaboration level 1 criteria for intussusception. The frequency and proportion of intussusception among overall surgical admissions, as well as the demographic and clinical information of the cases is described.
   Results: Overall 153 cases of intussusception among children <2 years-old were identified at participating sites over the enrolment period, confirmed by Level 1 Brighton criteria. These cases represented 2% of all surgical admissions under 2 years of age. One hundred twelve cases (73%) were male; the median age was 7 months; and the median duration of hospitalization was 7 days. One hundred forty-six (95%) children with intussusception required surgery, and 11 (7%) died.
   Conclusions: Confirmed cases of intussusception represented nearly 2% of pediatric surgical admissions at tertiary referral centers in Bangladesh during the study period and 7% of children with intussusception died. Given the high burden of rotavirus disease in Bangladesh, vaccine introduction is warranted, however, further studies after introduction of rotavirus vaccine are necessary to determine any association between vaccine and intussusception in this setting.

AB Introduction: In preparation for the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine into the routine immunization program of Bangladesh in 2018, we report data and highlight evolving genotypes from five years of active hospital-based rotavirus surveillance which began in July 2012.
   Methods: We enrolled and collected fresh stool from every fourth child < 5 years admitted with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) at 8 participating surveillance hospitals. Rotavirus infections were detected by enzyme immune assay. Twenty-five percent of rotavirus isolates were genotyped using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: We found that 64% (4832/7562) of children < 5 years of age admitted with AGE had evidence of rotavirus infection. The majority (57%) of patients with rotavirus infection were <12 months of age. The most common strains were G1P[8] (43%), G12P[8] (15%) and G9P[8] (9%); 11% of children had mixed infection. G3P[81], which has not been reported in Bangladesh since 2001, was documented for the first time in our surveillance system.
   Conclusions: The high burden of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations highlights the potential value of rotavirus vaccination in Bangladesh. Continued surveillance is important for monitoring the impact of vaccination as well as monitoring evolving genotypes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diarrheal disease due to Group A rotaviruses remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the less developed parts of the world. India has started a phased roll out of rotavirus vaccine in the national immunization program. This analysis summarizes the rotavirus genotype strain distribution pre-vaccine introduction in Vellore, India from December 2005 to June 2016. Rotavirus was responsible for 32% of all diarrheal admission to the hospital. G2P[4] was the predominant strain in the initial years and was gradually replaced by G1P[8]. The emergence of G9P[4] replacing G9P[8], and the detection of G12 strains over several years were documented. There was no clear seasonality of disease. These data form the baseline to monitor genotype distribution post-vaccine introduction in Tamil Nadu. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The indigenous oral rotavirus vaccine Rotavac (R) was introduced into the public immunization system in India in 2016 and will be expanded in phases. This data will describe the epidemiology of intussusception in India in absence of rotavirus vaccination and will help in setting up or designing a safety monitoring system.
   Methods: Medical records of intussusception cases between 2013 and 2016 in two major referral hospitals in Tamil Nadu, India were reviewed, and data on clinical presentation and management and outcome were collated.
   Results: A total of 284 cases of intussusception were diagnosed and managed at the two centers of which 280/284 could be classified as level 1 by the Brighton criteria. Median age at presentation was 8 months (Inter Quartile Range, IQR 6-17.2) with a male to female ratio of 2.1:1. Over half (57.7%) required surgical intervention while the rest underwent non-surgical or conservative management.
   Conclusions: Retrospective data from referral hospitals is sufficient to classify cases of intussusception by the Brighton criteria. These baseline data will be useful for monitoring when rotavirus vaccination is introduced. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Diarrhea; Children under five; Rotavirus vaccine; Indonesia
ID SURVEILLANCE; MORTALITY; BURDEN; IMPACT
AB Context: Rotavirus diarrhea is a common disease worldwide which mostly affects children under five years old. Rotavirus infection causes severe diarrhea and leads to substantial health care costs. In Indonesia the rotavirus vaccine has been available since 2011, however it has not been included into the National Immunization Program. This study aims to describe the proportion of rotavirus in children under 5 in Indonesia, the clinical characteristics of rotavirus infections, and the rotavirus strains circulating in the country during 2010-2015.
   Methods: Children under five years of age with acute watery diarrhea were prospectively identified and enrolled through the active diarrhea surveillance system in 5 sites in four provinces in Indonesia during 2010-2015. The rotavirus specimens were tested using Enzyme Immunoassay. Bivariate logistic regression tests were performed to compare rotavirus positive and negative results with respect to the collected demographic and clinical variables.
   Results: From January 2010 to December 2015, the average annual rotavirus prevalence among children hospitalized with acute watery diarrhea in four provinces in Indonesia was 47.5%. Rotavirus diarrhea occurred mostly in children under 2 years of age. Of all age groups, children aged 6-11 and 12-23 months had the highest prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea in all years (54.2% and 50.6%, respectively). This study found that the most prevalent of G and P genotypes were G1P8 in 2010 (63.2%), 2011 (64.1%) and 2012 (74.6%) and G3P8 in 2013 (49.7%), 2014 (82.5%) and 2015 (84.4%)
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea in hospitalized children in Indonesia. These findings highlight the need for inclusion of the rotavirus vaccine to the National Immunization Program in Indonesia. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID VACCINE
AB Background: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children <5 years of age in Myanmar. The purpose of this analysis is to report from the sentinel surveillance system for rota virus gastroenteritis (RVGE), which collects information on the epidemiology and circulating genotypes to assess the disease burden and support vaccine introduction in Myanmar.
   Methods: Prospective, active surveillance for RVGE-associated hospitalizations was conducted during 2009-2014 at Yangon Children's Hospital. Stool samples collected from children <5 years of age admitted for AGE were screened for rotavirus antigen by ELISA (ProSpecT (TM) Rotavirus, OXOID-UK). G and P genotyping was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Overall, 1860/3724 (49.9%) of stool samples tested positive for rotavirus, ranging from 42-56% of hospitalized AGE cases each year. RVGE was predominant in the 6-11 months age group 889/1860 (47.8%) as compared with 12-23 months 633/1860 (34.0%), 0-5 months 226/1860 (12.2 %) and 24-59 months 112/1860 (6.0%). RVGE occurred in a seasonal cycle with peak occurrence in the cold and dry months (November to February), accounting for 65.3% (1151/1763) among enrolled AGE cases. Vomiting (84.1% Vs 67.9%; P < .01), fever (84.5% Vs 75.6%; P < .01) and dehydration (78% Vs 69%; P < .01) were more frequently observed in RVGE than non-RVGE.
   Genotyping revealed that G1P[8] was predominant from January to June 2009, G12P[8] was predominant throughout 2009-2012 which was replaced in 2012-2013 by G2P[4] and changed again to G1P[8] in 2013-2014 and G9B[8] in late 2014.
   Conclusions: Rotavirus is accounting for approximately half of AGE-associated hospitalizations among children <5 years of age in Myanmar. There is immense diversity of rotavirus strains similar to that reported previously for other countries in the region. Information gained from this surveillance system highlights consideration of rotavirus vaccine introduction into this target population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Intussusception; Rotavirus vaccine
ID INFANTS; EFFICACY; SAFETY; RISK
AB Background: Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea in Nepali children, accounting for 25-33% of childhood diarrhea hospitalizations. Two rotavirus vaccines recommended for inclusion in national immunization programs have been associated with a low risk of intussusception in post marketing studies conducted in several countries. Data on the epidemiology of intussusception hospitalizations are lacking in Nepal. Thus, we aimed to describe the epidemiology of intussusception-associated hospitalizations among Nepali children in preparation for rotavirus vaccine introduction.
   Methods: A retrospective review of intussusception hospitalizations for a three year period was conducted at two major pediatric hospitals in Kathmandu, Nepal. Possible intussusception cases were identified through admission, discharge, and operation theater logs and ultrasound registers. Cases with a diagnosis of possible intussusception were selected for medical record review and classified as confirmed if they met the Brighton Collaboration level 1 criteria of diagnostic certainty and the child was aged < 24 months. Data on demographics, clinical course, and outcome were abstracted and analyzed.
   Results: Eight-five confirmed intussusception cases were identified; most (96%) were confirmed at surgery. The number of intussusception cases peaked between ages 4-7 months; no cases occurred in children 0-2 months. Fifty-nine (64%) case-patients were male. The median duration of symptoms before admission was 2 days (range: 0-14). Abdominal pain, bloody stool, and vomiting were the most common clinical features. All cases underwent surgical treatment; there was only one death.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate the epidemiology of intussusception hospitalizations among children aged < 24 months in Nepal. Because the public health impact of rotavirus vaccination could be substantial in Nepal, where childhood diarrhea-related morbidity and mortality are high, this baseline knowledge of intussusception prior to introduction of rotavirus vaccine in the national immunization schedule will provide useful information for post-vaccine introduction safety monitoring.

AB Background: Rotavirus remains a significant causative agent of childhood acute gastroenteritis, particularly among children less than 5 years of age. Although precise data on childhood mortality associated with diarrheal disease in Nepal is not available, it is estimated that 22% of all rotavirus deaths globally occurs in neighboring country of India. In spite of the substantial burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis in the Indian subcontinent, rotavirus vaccine has not been introduced in Nepal. Continuous surveillance for monitoring rotavirus disease burden and molecular characterization is needed prior to rotavirus vaccine introduction in Nepal.
   Methods: A total of 3310 stool samples (2849 hospitalized cases and 461 non-hospitalized cases), were collected from patients <5 years of age from January 2013 to December 2016 and tested for rotavirus antigen by ELISA (ProSpecT, USA). A subset of ELISA positive stool samples was genotyped. Demographic data were collected.
   Results: During the four-year surveillance period, the overall burden of rotavirus infection was 24% among hospitalized children which was much higher than among non-hospitalized children (12%). The majority of children hospitalized with rotavirus gastroenteritis were less than 2 years of age (86%). Rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis hospitalizations occur year-round in Nepal, but a distinct peak in winter (up to 40% among hospitalized) was observed. Of 735 ELISA positive samples, 492 were genotyped by RT-PCR. The most prevalent genotype was G12P[6] (45.3%), followed by G2P[4](12.2%), G1P[8] (9.6%), G9P[4](7.3%), and G9P[8](4.5%). Mixed infection accounted for 4.4% of cases, 6.2% were partially typed and 10.5% of the samples were G and P untypable.
   Conclusions: A high burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis and a diversity of circulating rotavirus strains in Nepal were observed. Recommendation to introduce a rotavirus vaccine with known vaccine effectiveness would help in reducing the severity of Rotavirus diarrheal disease in children less than 5 years of age.

AB Background: Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute watery diarrhoea among children and is vaccine preventable. The aim of this hospital-based sentinel surveillance was to study the prevalence, demographic and clinical characteristics of rotavirus infections and to describe rotavirus genotype distribution patterns among children under five years of age hospitalized for acute watery diarrhea during the period of 2009-2016.
   Methods: Prospective, sentinel hospital-based surveillance was conducted in Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) from 2009 to 2016. Stool samples of children admitted with acute watery diarrhea were tested by rotavirus antigen detection 'ProSpecT' Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) at Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute, Colombo. Specimens that tested positive for rotavirus were further analyzed at the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) participating in the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated Global Rotavirus Surveillance Network (GRSN) to determine the genotype of strains by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Of the 6090 children with diarrhea admitted, 1801 (29.5%) had stools taken and tested. In years with at least 11 months of data (2010 and 2013) rotavirus was detected in 36.5% (228/624) of specimens. Genotype GIP[8] was the most common genotype detected throughout the surveillance period (30.1%; 123/408) with G2P [8], G9P[8] and G3P[8] also detected.
   Conclusions: Rotavirus is a common cause of pediatric diarrhea hospitalizations in Sri Lanka. National introduction of rotavirus vaccine could reduce the burden of pediatric diarrhea. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In Asia, rotavirus accounts for approximately 45% of admissions due to acute gastroenteritis in children <5 years, and causes about 145,000 deaths every year. We studied the distribution of rotavirus strains from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Nepal during 2009-2015.
   Methods: Stool samples collected from children <5 years of age hospitalized with acute diarrhea in the three sites and positive for rotavirus antigen by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were sent to the Christian Medical College, Vellore from 2009 to 2015. G and P typing of rotavirus strains were performed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Result: Of the 2354 EIA positive samples tested, G12P[8] (36.8%), G1P[8] (30.1%), and G12P[6] (41.3%) were the most common strains isolated from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Nepal respectively.
   Conclusion: There was substantial diversity of rotavirus genotypes, and continued surveillance in developing countries of Asia will help in understanding the epidemiology of rotavirus before and after introduction of vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Each year, approximately 1,066 Cambodian children under five years old die of diarrhea, and 51% of these deaths are due to rotavirus gastroenteritis. Quantifying childhood hospitalizations caused by severe rotavirus infections is also important in demonstrating disease burden caused by this virus. The objective of this study is to update and confirm the current burden of pediatric hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus gastroenteritis among Cambodian children using seven years of continuous active, prospective surveillance from 2010 to 2016. We also characterize the circulating rotavirus genotypic strains during this period.
   Methods: Active surveillance for rotavirus gastroenteritis was conducted from January 2010 through December 2016 at a national hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Children <60 months of age who were hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were consented and enrolled. Information on gender, age, clinical characteristics, and month of onset were collected. Stool specimens were collected and tested by enzyme immunoassay for the presence of rotavirus antigen, and genotyping was performed on rota virus test-positive specimens to characterize predominant rotavirus strains during the surveillance period.
   Results: Of 7007 children enrolled with AGE and having specimens collected, 3473 (50%) were attributed to rotavirus gastroenteritis. The majority of rotavirus hospitalizations occurred in children younger than two years old (92%). Year-round rotavirus transmission was observed, with seasonal peaks during the cooler, dry months between November and May. Genotypic trends in rotavirus were observed over the surveillance period; the predominant rotavirus strains changed from G1P[8] (2010-2012), to G2P[4] (2013-2014), the emergence of genotype G8P[8] in 2015, and G3P[8] in 2016.
   Conclusions: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations in Cambodian children under five years old, with 50% of such hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus. Over 90% of rota virus hospitalizations occurred in children under 2 years of age. Changes in the predominant rotavirus strains occurred over time among these unvaccinated children. This information is important to understand and prioritize the current potential impacts upon child health that could be achieved through the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in Cambodia.

AB Introduction: In China, rotavirus is the leading cause of diarrhea hospitalizations among children aged <5 years. A locally manufactured rotavirus vaccine is available for private market use, but little is known about its coverage. Given the impending availability of newer rotavirus vaccines, we evaluated intussusception rates among children aged <2 years to better understand intussusception epidemiology for future vaccine safety monitoring.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective review at 4 hospitals in Chenzhou City of Hunan Province and Kaifeng City of Henan Province. We identified intussusception cases admitted during 2009-2013 by reviewing medical records with the ICD-10 discharge code for intussusception and extracting demographic and clinical information from the electronic clinical record systems.
   Results: During 2009-2013, 1715 intussusception hospitalizations among 1,487,215 children aged <2 years occurred in both cities. The average annual intussusception hospitalization incidence was 112.9 per 100,000 children aged <2 years (181.8 per 100,000 children <1 year; 56 per 100,000 children 1 to <2 years). Intussusception incidence was low among infants aged <3 months and peaked at age 6-8 months. No clear seasonality was observed. Ultrasound was used to diagnose 95.9% of cases. Enema reduction was performed in 80% cases; 25% of cases in Chenzhou and 16% in Kaifeng required surgical intervention. No deaths were reported. The median time between symptom onset and admission was 1 day.
   Conclusions: This study provides information on intussusception incidence and epidemiology in two cities of China during 2009-2013. Monitoring intussusception rates in this population will be important in the post-rotavirus vaccine era. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rotavirus enteritis is responsible for nearly 200,000 child deaths worldwide in 2015. Globally, many low and middle-income countries have introduced rotavirus vaccine, resulting in documented reductions in hospitalizations and child mortality. We examined the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing rotavirus vaccination in Lao People's Democratic Republic using an Excel-based spreadsheet model. We estimated mortality risk factors, patterns of care seeking, and vaccination access to predict outcomes for regional, provincial, and socioeconomic subpopulations for one birth cohort through their first five years of life and life course in Disability-Adjusted Life Years estimates. Socioeconomic status was defined by categorizing households into regional wealth quintiles based on a national asset index. We modeled a two-dose ROTARIX vaccine under current Gavi pricing and efficacy estimates from Bangladesh and Vietnam. DPT1 and DPT2 coverages were used to estimate rotavirus vaccination coverage. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of uncertainty on model parameters on predicted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), including scenarios of increases in vaccination coverage. Rotavirus vaccination would prevent 143 child deaths/year, or 28% of annual rotavirus burden. The estimated national level ICER for rotavirus vaccination was $140/DALY, with regional socioeconomic subpopulation estimates ranging from $72/DALY for the poorest in the Central region to $353/DALY for the richest in the North region, indicating high cost-effectiveness. Within regions, ICERs are most favorable for children in the poorer and poorest quintiles. However, the full benefits of rotavirus vaccination will only be realized by reducing disparities in vaccination coverage, access to treatment, and environmental health. Improving vaccination coverage to equitable levels alone would prevent 87 additional child deaths per year. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Diarrhea is a leading cause of death in children <5 years worldwide, causing an estimated 215,000 deaths in 2013. This evaluation tracks the epidemiologic patterns and most common rotavirus genotypes among hospitalized children in this age group with acute gastroenteritis in Lao PDR
   Methods: Children <5 years in a central tertiary hospital in the capital city were prospectively enrolled into the surveillance platform during January 2009-December 2015. We collected information regarding clinical characteristics of enrolled children. Stool samples were obtained within 24 h of hospital admission and tested for rotavirus using rotavirus antigen detection enzyme immunoassay. Samples were sent to the regional reference laboratories in Australia and South Korea for genotyping. Bivariate analyses compared demographic and clinical characteristics between rotavirus positive and negative children using Chi-square statistical testing. Seasonality of rotavirus and annual genotype distribution are also described.
   Results: We enrolled 1853 children <5 years with acute gastroenteritis during the surveillance period and collected 1772 fecal specimens, 982 (55%) of which tested positive for rotavirus. A higher proportion of rotavirus acute gastroenteritis was observed among children 12-23 months of age as compared to rota virus negative children in the same age group, 41% vs 36%. Eighty-six percent of rotavirus positive children experienced vomiting, as compared to 65% of rotavirus negative children. Eighty-five percent (n = 830/982) of rotavirus positive specimens occurred during the dry season (January-April). The most common genotypes identified were G1, G2, G3 and P8 and P4. The most prevalent combined genotype differed annually during the surveillance period.
   Conclusion: Surveillance continues to be important in documenting the burden of rotavirus in children <5 years in Lao PDR as well as providing a baseline for determining the impact of rotavirus vaccine once it is introduced into Lao PDR's national immunization schedule.

AB Background: Diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of illness and death in young children in the world, especially the developing countries. Diarrheal disease results in about half a million childhood death per year, ranking second among all causes worldwide. Diarrheal disease due to rotavirus infection is currently the most common cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide. Rotavirus immunization of infants is a safe and effective public health intervention for rotavirus infection control and expected to lead to a reduction of childhood morbidity and mortality.
   Methods: We conducted hospital-based surveillance at two representative hospitals in Mongolia to estimate the burden of hospitalizations for rotavirus diarrhea among children aged <5 years and to describe strain distribution patterns during 6-year study period. Fecal specimens were tested by rotavirus antigen detection enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Specimens that tested positive for rotavirus were further characterized to determine the genotype of strains by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Between April 2009 and March 2016, among 7076 eligible children with diarrhea 6078 patients were enrolled nationally. Forty-six percent (2794/6078) of EIA a specimens were positive for rotavirus. Ninety-three percent (5649/6078) of hospitalizations for diarrhea involved children less than 2 years. No deaths were recorded due to rotavirus diarrhea. The most common genotype was G3P [8] (47.7%) followed by G9P [6] (14.4%), G2P [4] (12%), and G9P [8] (7.1%).
   Conclusions: This study found a relatively high prevalence of severe rotavirus-associated diarrhea disease in Mongolia and infants were the most affected. It highlights the urgent need for introduction of rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization program. Continued surveillance is crucial and pre-vaccine introduction rotavirus genotype patterns in Mongolia are valuable and can be followed post-introduction to assess vaccine impact.

AB With the availability of new and existing rotavirus vaccines, credible and reliable data on burden of rotavirus-associated disease are needed to enable evidence-based decision making regarding the introduction of rotavirus vaccines. The national rotavirus surveillance program in the Philippines, a sentinel-based surveillance, was established in 2012 to determine the proportion of laboratory confirmed rotavirus cases among children under five years with acute gastroenteritis and to describe the geographic distribution and molecular epidemiology of rotavirus in the country. During 2013 to 2015, rotavirus infection was the cause of acute gastroenteritis among children under five years admitted to hospitals or evaluated in emergency rooms, constituting more than one-third of gastroenteritis hospitalizations at the sentinel site hospitals. The predominant genotype observed was G1P[8]. Although a rotavirus surveillance network has been established, findings suggest the need to strengthen the network in the country and to continue monitoring prevalent rotavirus strains to help identify the possible emergence of new strains.

ID HOSPITAL-BASED SURVEILLANCE; CHILDREN; GASTROENTERITIS
AB A prospective, multicentre study was conducted in four sentinel surveillance hospitals to assess the trend and epidemiology of acute diarrhea caused by Rotavirus in Vietnam. During the period 2012-2015, a total 8,889 children under 5 years of age were enrolled in the surveillance, and 8689 stool samples were collected. Of these cases, Rotavirus was most common pathogen 46.7% (4054 cases); in which 26.6% (1117) rotavirus-positive stool samples were evaluated to identify genotypes. The proportion of rotavirus positive specimens decreased annually from 54.7% in 2012 to 36.6% in 2015. Rotavirus was detected year-round, but most rotavirus gastroenteritis cases (77.1%) occurred between December and May, corresponding to the rotavirus seasonality. It is found that the peaks varied by regions. Rotavirus positivities varied between the youngest and oldest age, but children 6-11 months old (38.8%) and 12-23 months old (38.4%) counted for most cases. A significant higher number of diarrhea within 24 hours (83 times, 95%CI: 8.1-8.4 times) and higher proportion of severe dehydration (12.9%) in Rotavirus positive group than that in Rotavirus negative group (7.7 times, 95%CI: 7.6-7.9 times; and 9.7%, respectively). A downtrend of prevalence of G1P[8] was observed from 82% in 2013 to 15% in 2015. However, G2P[4] was found in 5% of samples in 2012, 9% in 2013, 36% in 2014, and 28% in 2015. Rotavirus infection is the most important cause of acute diarrhea among hospitalized children in Vietnam, and a rotavirus vaccination program for children may significantly reduce this disease.

DE Intussusception
ID REDUCTION; SAFETY; ENEMA
AB In some settings, rotavirus vaccines have been associated with a low-level risk of intussusception, the most common cause of bowel obstruction in infants. As Vietnam prepares to introduce rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization program, we sought to better characterize the epidemiology of recurrent intussusception. We enrolled children <2 years of age who were hospitalized for intussusception retrospectively from January 2013 through December 2014 and prospectively from January 2015 through December 2016 at 2 hospitals in Vietnam. We enrolled 2477 children. Nearly all children were successfully treated by enema with low surgery rate (1%). We found 10% of children (n = 254) experienced at least once recurrence (range: 1-6) and 57% of first recurrences happened within the first 12 weeks after treatment of the first episode. The median age at first intussusception was 13 months for children without a recurrent episode and 10 months for children with a recurrence. The symptoms of the recurrent cases were milder with less vomiting (67%), bloody stool (7%) and fever (10%) compared to the initial cases (p < 0.01). We found the rate of recurrences following enema reduction of intussusception to be similar to that reported from other countries. Due to the high rate of intussusception and recurrent episodes in Vietnam, a better understanding of the cause of recurrent intussusception will be critical in assessing intussusception cases after rotavirus introduction.

AB Ex vivo expansion is an effective strategy to acquire cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells needed for clinical trials. In this work, the effects of dynamic suspension culture, which was carried out by shake flasks on a shaker, on CIK cells were investigated by the analysis of expansion characteristics and physiological functions, with the objective to optimize the culture conditions for ex vivo expansion of CIK cells. The results showed that the expansion folds of total cells in dynamic cultures reached 69.36 +/- 30.36 folds on day 14, which were significantly higher than those in static cultures (9.24 +/- 1.12 folds, P < 0.05), however, the proportions of CD3(+) cells and CD3(+) CD56(+) cells in both cultures were similar, leading to much higher expansion of CD3(+) cells and CD3(+) CD56(+) cells in dynamic cultures. Additionally, expanded CIK cells in two cultures possessed comparable physiological functions. Notably, significantly higher percentages of CD25(+) cells and CD69(+) cells were found in dynamic cultures (P < 0.05). Besides, much higher glucose consumption rate of cells (P < 0.05) but similar Y-Lac/gluc were observed in dynamic cultures. Further, cells in dynamic cultures had better glucose utilization efficiency. Together, these results suggested that dynamic cultures improved cell activation, then accelerated glucose consumption rate, which enhanced cell expansion and promoted glucose utilization efficiency of cells.

AB Cardiomyocytes (CMs), derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), have the potential to be used in cardiac repair. Addition of physical cues, such as electrical and mechanical stimulations, have proven to significantly effect morphology, density, cardiogenesis, maturity and functionality of differentiated CMs. This work combines rigorous fluid dynamics investigation and flow frequency analysis with iPSC differentiation experiments to identify and quantify the flow characteristics leading to a significant increase of differentiation yield. This is towards a better understanding of the physical relationship between frequency modulation and embryoid bodies suspension, and the development of dimensionless correlations applicable at larger scales.
   Laser Doppler Anemometry and Fast Fourier Transform analysis were used to identify characteristic flow frequencies under different agitation modes. Intermittent agitation resulted in a pattern of low intensity frequencies at reactor scale that could be controlled by varying three identified time components: rotational speed, interval and dwell times. A proof of concept biological study was undertaken, tuning the hydrodynamic environment through variation of dwell time based on the engineering study findings and a significant improvement in CM yield was obtained. This work introduces the concept of fine-tuning the physical hydrodynamic cues within a three-dimensional flow system to improve cardiomyocyte differentiation of iPSC.

AB Environmental gradient is an important common issue during scale-up process for protein production. To address the dynamic regulatory mechanism of Aspergillus niger being exposed to inhomogeneous glucose concentrations, glucose perturbation were experimented on the steady state of A. niger chemostat culture, and dynamic profiles of the intracellular metabolites in central carbon metabolism were tracked in a time scale of seconds. The upper glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway showed sharp variations after glucose perturbation, while the lower glycolysis, TCA cycle and amino acid pools represented a moderate and prolonged response due to the allosteric regulation of enzymes and buffering function of metabolites with large pool sizes. Improved glucose-6-phosphate enhanced the metabolic flux to PP pathway remarkably, which provided not only more redox cofactors (NADPH) for protein synthesis but also more precursors (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and ribose-5-phosphate) for cell growth. Moreover, reduction of the total adenine nucleotides and major precursor amino acids indicated the upregulated RNA synthesis was required to produce stress proteins, and partially explained the drop of glucoamylase production when A. niger experienced a fluctuated glucose concentration environment. These findings would be valuable for improving bioreactor operation, design, and scaleup from engineering or genetic aspects.

AB Leuconostoc citreum is an important lactic acid bacterium used as a starter culture for producing kimchi, the traditional Korean fermented vegetables. An efficient host strain for plasmid transformation, L. citreum EFEL2700, was isolated from kimchi, and it has been frequently used for genetic engineering of L. citreum. In this study, we report the whole genome sequence of the strain and its genetic characteristics. Genome assembly yielded 5 contigs (1 chromosome and 4 plasmids), and the complete genome contained 1,923,830 base pairs (bp) with a G+ C content of 39.0%. Average nucleotide identity analysis showed high homology (>= 99%) to the reference strain L. citreum KM 20. The smallest plasmid (4.3 kbp) was used as an Escherichia coli shuttle vector (pCB) for heterologous gene expression, and L. citreum EFEL2700 showed the highest transformation efficiency, 6.7 x 10(4) CFU mu g(-1) DNA. Genetic analysis of the genome enabled the construction of primary metabolic pathway showing a typical hetero-type lactic acid fermentation. Notably, no core genes for primary metabolism were observed in plasmid 4 and it could be eliminated to create an efficient host for gene transformation. This report will facilitate the understanding and application of L. citreum EFEL2700 as a food-grade microbial cell factory.

AB Biodesulfurization is an eco-friendly process for removing sulfur from petroleum fractions. The process could not be commercialized because of the inability of microorganisms to desulfurize a wide range of heterocyclic poly aromatic sulfur compounds like dibenzothiophene (DBT), 4, 6-Dimethyl DBT present in fuel and low desulfurization activity. In the present study, to improve the rates of conversion of dibenzothiophene to dibenzothiophene sulfone, the responsible enzyme dibenzothiophene monooxygenase DszC, is displayed on the surface of Escherichia coli. This helped in overcoming the mass transfer limitation and resulted in approximately 3 times faster conversion with respect to control (which contained intracellular enzyme). This is the first report demonstrating display of a biodesulfurization enzyme on bacterial cell surface.

AB Although pH control at physiological levels is generally considered as the optimal culture condition, in some cases other strategies should be taken into account for their beneficial effects on process performance. pH and CO2 levels are chemical variables that have a major impact in cell growth and product titers in cell culture since their effect on key metabolic routes. HEK293 cells expressing recombinant hIFN gamma showed different metabolic behavior when cultured in shake flask compared to pH-controlled bioreactors, in which a decrease in cell density and product titer were observed. This yield loss observed in bioreactor cultures could be reverted by adding 1% CO2 to air inlet flow in a non-controlled pH bioprocess. With this strategy, a significant outcome of 4-fold increase in terms of maximum cell density and 2-fold increase in volumetric concentration of recombinant protein (hIFN gamma) when compared to the pH-controlled culture in bioreactor (standard culture conditions) has been obtained. Results evidenced the importance of pH and CO2 concentration in this case, in order to reproduce the behavior observed in optimization experiments performed in shake flasks. Thus, it was demonstrated that not always constant controlled variable setpoint (like pH or CO2 addition) becomes the best bioprocess performance strategy.

AB This study provided a system for bacteria detection based on a lysosome-like-vacuole response in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vacuoles are factors known to activate the immune system in the presence of foreign substances. Here, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri were exposed to yeast to analyze the alteration of vacuolar enzymes. The ability to detect the bacteria was evaluated by confocal microscopy after exposing and staining vacuoles with LysoTracker. Results showed that the treatment of yeast with these bacteria increased the number of red vacuole-like organelles surrounding yeast nuclei. Thus, vacuole alteration can be used as a biomarker for bacteria detection. Next, the expression of vacuolar enzymes under the influence of bacteria was examined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) method for screening specific biomarkers for each Shigella strain. Finally, the recombinant yeasts that contained biomarkers fused to different fluorescent proteins confirmed the ability of yeast to detect these two Shigella strains at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 CFU/mL.

AB The process of microbial transglutaminase (TG) covalent immobilization on an ultrafiltration membrane surface, the optimum immobilization conditions and the characteristics of the enzymatic membrane in a reactor were investigated. The process of TG immobilization on polyethersulfone (PES) membrane surfaces was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The optimal condition for TG immobilization was in pH 5.0 phosphate buffer containing TG (20 U/mL). The immobilized TG had a high affinity for the substrate according to the kinetic parameters and retained 50% activity until the twentieth day. Water contact angle and antifouling tests showed that the hydrophilicity of immobilized-transglutaminase membrane was improved compared with pure PES membrane. The enzyme could maintain relatively high activity under a transmembrane pressure of 0.15 MPa. Moreover, the enzymatic membrane had higher relative membrane flux at 0.15 MPa in a membrane reactor, and could retain its activity in pH 5.0 phosphate buffer and catalysis under 40 degrees C.

AB Sterol glycosyltransferases catalyze the formation of a variety of glycosylated sterol derivatives and are involved in producing a plethora of bioactive natural products. To understand the molecular mechanism of sterol glycosyltransferases, we determined crystal structures of a sterol glycosyltransferase UGT51 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structures of the UGT51 and its complex with uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) were solved at resolutions of 2.77 angstrom and 1.9 angstrom, respectively. The structural analysis revealed that a long hydrophobic cavity, 9.2 angstrom in width and 17.6 angstrom in length located at the N-terminal domain of UGT51, is suitable for the accommodation of sterol acceptor substrates. Furthermore, a short, conserved sequence of S847-M851 was identified at the bottom of the hydrophobic cavity, which might be the steroid binding site and play an important role for the UGT51 catalytic specificity towards sterols. Molecular docking simulations indicated that changed unique interaction network in mutant M7_1 (S(801)A/L(802)A/V(804)A/K(812)A/(EK)-K-816/S(849)A/(ND)-D-892), with an 1800-fold activity improvement toward an unnatural substrate protopanaxadiol (PPD), might influence its substrate preference. This study reported the first sterol glycosyltransferase structure, providing a molecular blueprint for generating tailored sterol glycosyltransferases as potential catalytic elements in synthetic biology.

AB Computational design with supersecondary structures as building blocks has proven effective in the construction of new proteins with controlled geometries. So far, this approach has primarily exploited amplification, effectively harnessing the internal folding propensity of self-compatible fragments to achieve sufficient enthalpy for folding. Here we exploit an interface-driven strategy to depart from the repeat design realm, constructing an asymmetric, globular domain from heterologous supersecondary structures. We report the successful design of a dRP lyase domain fold, which agrees with the experimental NMR structure at atomic accuracy (backbone RMSD of 0.94 angstrom). Our results show that the residual folding information within conserved fragments, combined with efficient interface-directed sampling, can effectively yield globular proteins with novel sequences and biophysical properties.

AB The CCR4-NOT complex plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression and degradation of messenger RNAs. The multisubunit complex assembles on the NOT1 protein, which acts as a 'scaffold' and is highly conserved in eukaryotes. NOT1 consists of a series of helical domains that serve as docking sites for other CCR4-NOT subunits. We describe a crystal structure of a connector domain of NOT1 from the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum (Ct). Comparative structural analysis indicates that this domain adopts a MIF4G-like fold and we have termed it the MIF4G-C domain. Solution scattering studies indicate that the human MIF4G-C domain likely adopts a very similar fold to the Ct MIF4G-C. MIF4G domains have been described to mediate interactions with DEAD-box helicases such as DDX6. However, comparison of the interfaces of the MIF4G-C with the MIF4G domain of NOT1 that interacts with DDX6 reveals key structural differences that explain why the MIF4G-C does not bind DDX6. We further show that the human MIF4G-C does not interact stably with other subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex. The structural conservation of the MIF4G-C domain suggests that it may have an important but presently undefined role in the CCR4-NOT complex.

AB Bacterial sliding clamps bind to DNA and act as protein-protein interaction hubs for several proteins involved in DNA replication and repair. The partner proteins all bind to a common pocket on sliding clamps via conserved linear peptide sequence motifs, which suggest the pocket as an attractive target for development of new antibiotics. Herein we report the X-ray crystal structures and biochemical characterization of 13 sliding clamps from the Gram-negative pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae. The structures reveal close similarity between the pathogen and Escherichia coli clamps and similar patterns of binding to linear clamp-binding motif peptides. The results suggest that linear motif-sliding clamp interactions are well conserved and an antibiotic targeting the sliding clamp should have broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens.

AB Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into susceptible cells is a fast intricate process that is not fully understood. Although, previous studies explored different aspects of this process by means of biochemical and inhibitors assays, a clear morphological characterization of its steps at the ultrastructural level is still lacking. We attempted to characterize those intermediates involved during HCMV entry by developing a methodological approach that resulted in optimal ultrastructure preservation and allowed for 3D imaging. It involves rapid freezing and cryosubstitution which ensure a clear visibility of membranous leaflets as well as retained membranous continuity. Likewise, it delivered a reproducible optimization of the growth and infection conditions that are pivotal towards maintaining biologically active enriched input virus particles. Data acquisition was achieved through STEM tomography in a 3D context. Indeed, several intermediates that characterize HCMV entry-related events were observed both extra- and intracellularly. Some of the cell-membrane associated viral particles that we referred to as "Pinocchio particles" were morphologically altered in comparison to the cell-free virions. We were also able to characterize intracellular fusion intermediates taking place between the viral envelope and the vesicular membranes. Furthermore, inhibiting actin polymerization by Latrunculin-A enabled us to spot fusion-like intermediates of the viral envelope with the host cell plasma membrane that we did not observe in the untreated infected cells. Our data also suggests that Dyngo-4a; a dynamin-2 inhibitor, does not interfere with the internalization of the HCMV into the host cells as previously deduced.

AB The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) F1Fo-ATP synthase (alpha(3):beta(3):gamma:epsilon:a:b:b':c(9)) is an essential enzyme that supplies energy for both the aerobic growing and the hypoxic dormant stage of the mycobacterial life cycle. Employing the heterologous F-ATP synthase model system alpha(chi)(3):beta(3):gamma we showed previously, that transfer of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Mtb subunit alpha (Mt(alpha 51-549)) to a standard F-ATP synthase a subunit suppresses ATPase activity. Here we determined the 3D reconstruction from electron micrographs of the alpha(chi)(3):beta(3):gamma complex reconstituted with the Mtb subunit epsilon (Mt epsilon), which has been shown to crosstalk with the CTD of Mt alpha. Together with the first solution shape of Mtb subunit alpha (Mt alpha), derived from solution X-ray scattering, the structural data visualize the extended C-terminal stretch of the mycobacterial subunit alpha. In addition, Mt epsilon mutants Mt epsilon R62L, Mt epsilon E87A, Mt epsilon(6-121), and Mt epsilon(1-120), reconstituted with alpha(chi)(3):beta(3):gamma provided insight into their role in coupling and in trapping inhibiting MgADP. NMR solution studies of Mt epsilon E87A gave insights into how this residue contributes to stability and crosstalk between the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the CTD of Mt epsilon. Analyses of the N-terminal mutant MI epsilon(6-121) highlight the differences of the NTD of mycobacterial subunit e to the well described Geobacillul stearothermophilus or Escherichia coli counterparts. These data are discussed in context of a crosstalk between the very N-terminal amino acids of Mt epsilon and the loop region of one c subunit of the c-ring turbine for coupling of proton-translocation and ATP synthesis activity.

AB Structural characterization of BMAP-28(1-18), a potent bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide can aid in understanding its mechanism of action at molecular level. We report NMR structure of the BMAP-28(1-18) and its mutated analogue mutBMAP18 in SDS micelles. Structural comparison of the peptides bound to SDS micelles and POPE-POPG vesicles using circular dichroism, suggest that structures in the two lipid preparations are similar. Antimicrobial assays show that even though both these peptides adopt helical conformation, BMAP-28(1-18) is more potent than mutBMAP18 in killing bacterial cells. Our EM images clearly indicate that the peptides target the bacterial cell membrane resulting in leakage of its contents. The structural basis for difference in activity between these peptides was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. Inability of the mutBMAP18 to retain its helical structure in presence of POPE:POPG membrane as opposed to the BMAP-28(1-18) at identical peptide/lipid ratios could be responsible for its decreased activity. Residues SerS, Arg8 and Arg12 of the BMAP28(1-18) are crucial for its initial anchoring to the bilayer. We conclude that along with amphipathicity, a stable secondary structure that can promote/initiate membrane anchoring is key in determining membrane destabilization potential of these AMPs. Our findings are a step towards understanding the role of specific residues in antimicrobial activity of BMAP-28(1-18), which will facilitate design of smaller, cost-effective therapeutics and would also help prediction algorithms to expedite screening out variants of the parent peptide with greater accuracy.

AB Mis-incorporation of modified nucleotides, such as 5-methyl-dCTP or 8-oxo-dGTP, in DNA can be detrimental to genomic integrity. MutT proteins are sanitization enzymes which function by hydrolyzing such nucleotides and regulating the pool of free nucleotides in the cytoplasm. Mycobacterial genomes have a set of four MutT homologs, namely, MutTl, MutT2, MutT3 and MutT4. Mycobacterial MutT2 hydrolyzes 5 m-dCTP and 8-oxo-dGTP to their respective monophosphate products. Additionally, it can hydrolyze canonical nucleotides dCTP and CTP, with a suggested role in sustaining their optimal levels in the nucleotide pool. The structures of M. smegmatis MutT2 and its complexes with cytosine derivatives have been determined at resolutions ranging from 1.10 angstrom to 1.73 angstrom. The apo enzyme and its complexes with products (dCMP, CMP and 5 m-dCMP) crystallize in space group P2(1)2(1)2, while those involving substrates (dCTP, CTP and 5 m-dCTP) crystallize in space group P2(1). The molecule takes an alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold arrangement, as observed in other MutT homologs. The nucleoside moiety of the ligands is similarly located in all the complexes, while the location of the remaining tail exhibits variability. This is the first report of a MutT2-type protein in complex with ligands. A critical interaction involving Asp116 confers the specificity of the enzyme towards cytosine moieties. A conserved set of enzyme-ligand interactions along with concerted movements of important water molecules provide insights into the mechanism of action.

AB Three dimensional electron microscopy is becoming a very data-intensive field in which vast amounts of experimental images are acquired at high speed. To manage such large-scale projects, we had previously developed a modular workflow system called Scipion (de la Rosa-Trevfn et al., 2016). We present here a major extension of Scipion that allows processing of EM images while the data is being acquired. This approach helps to detect problems at early stages, saves computing time and provides users with a detailed evaluation of the data quality before the acquisition is finished. At present, Scipion has been deployed and is in production mode in seven Cryo-EM facilities throughout the world.

AB The crustacean cuticle forms skeletal elements consisting of chitin-protein fibrils reinforced by amorphous and crystalline calcium carbonate and phosphate minerals. The edges of skeletal elements are of particular interest. They are subject to repeated strain and stress because they form transitions to the arthrodial membranes connecting them. These allow for relative movements of skeletal elements. In this study, we investigate structure, chemical composition, mineral organization and local mechanical properties of the anterior and posterior edges of the tergite cuticle in the conglobating beach isopod Tylos europaeus and compare these with the protective dorsal region of the tergites.
   The distribution of mineral phases at the edges resembles that of dorsal regions of the tergites. At the transition with the unmineralized arthrodial membrane the calcite containing distal exocuticle is replaced by epicuticular material and the subjacent cuticular layers containing amorphous calcium carbonate become enriched with amorphous calcium phosphate. At the edges, the local elastic modulus and hardness values are significantly lower compared to dorsal regions of the tergite cuticle, for both, the calcite and the amorphous mineral containing layers. The calcite within the tergite cuticle is assembled in different texture patterns: (i) almost random co-orientation, (ii) almost single crystalline calcite, and (iii) a graded organization. Calcite organization and co-orientation strength is highly variable, not only on very few tens of micrometres, but also between regions with different skeletal functionality. Our results show that besides structure and composition, patterns of calcite organization contribute to the hierarchical architecture and functionality of biological composites.

AB The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis responds to starvation by entering a morphological differentiation process leading to the formation of a highly resistant spore. Early in the sporulation process, the cell asymmetrically divides into a large compartment (the mother cell) and a smaller one (the forespore), which will maturate into a resistant spore. Proper development of the forespore requires the assembly of a multiprotein complex called the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex or "A-Q complex". This complex involves the forespore protein SpoIIQ and eight mother cell proteins (SpoIIIAA to SpoIIIAH), many of which share structural similarities with components of specialized secretion systems and flagella found in Gram-negative bacteria. The assembly of the A-Q complex across the two membranes that separate the mother cell and forespore was recently shown to require GerM. GerM is a lipoprotein composed of two GerMN domains, a family of domains with unknown function. Here, we report X-ray crystallographic structures of the first GerMN domain of GerM at 1.0 angstrom resolution, and of the soluble domain of GerM (the tandem of GerMN domains) at 2.1 angstrom resolution. These structures reveal that GerMN domains can adopt distinct conformations and that the core of these domains display structural similarities with ring-building motifs found in components of specialized secretion system and in SpoIIIA proteins. This work provides an additional piece towards the structural characterization of the A-Q complex.

AB The X-ray diffraction patterns of quill and hair, as well as other trichocyte keratin appendages, contain meridional reflections that can be indexed on an axial repeat of 470 angstrom. Unusually, however, many of the expected orders are not observed. A possible explanation, proposed by Fraser and MacRae (1983), was that the intermediate filaments (IF) that constitute the fibrillar component of the filament/matrix texture consist of 4-chain protofilaments arranged on a surface lattice subject to a helical dislocation. The radial projection of the resulting 8-protofilament ribbon was defined in terms of a two-dimensional unit cell characterized by vectors (a, b) with axial projections z(a) similar to 74 angstrom and z(b) similar to 198 angstrom. This situation resembles that found in microtubules, where helical dislocations in subunit packing are also encountered, leading to a so-called "seam" along their length (Metoz and Wade, 1997). In keratin, however, the protofilaments are helical so the seam is inclined to the axis of the IF. Here we report details of the Patterson function that provides independent evidence for both the helical dislocation and the dimensions of the surface lattice. In addition, the observed meridional X-ray amplitudes have been compared with those predicted by various models of the axial distribution of electron density. A new model, adapted from one previously proposed, fits the data significantly better than has heretofore proved possible. An interpretation of the model in terms of either specific keratin-associated-protein (KAP) binding or the retention of IF symmetry by a portion of the head and/or tail domains is suggested.

AB Substrate-binding proteins (SBPs) are periplasmic proteins consisting of two alpha/beta domains joined by a hinge region with specificity towards cognate ligands. Based on three-dimensional fold, sugar-specific SBPs have been classified into cluster B and cluster D-I. The analysis of sequences and structures of sugar-binding pocket of cluster D-I SBPs revealed the presence of extra residues on two loops (L1, L2) and a helix (H1) in few members of this family, that binds specifically to monosaccharides. Presence of conserved histidine in L2 and tryptophan in H1 can be considered as the identity marks for the cluster D-I monosaccharide-binding SBPs. A glucose binding protein (ppGBP) from Pseudomonas putida CSV86 was found to contain a structural fold similar to oligosaccharide-binding cluster D-I SBPs, but functionally binds to only glucose due to constriction of its binding pocket mainly by L2 (375-382). ppGBP with partial deletion of L2 (ppGBP Delta L2) was created, crystallized and biochemical characterization was performed. Compared to wild type ppGBP, the ppGBP Delta L2 structure showed widening of the glucose-binding pocket with similar to 80% lower glucose binding. Our results show that the substrate specificity of SBPs can be altered by modulating the size of the binding pocket. Based on this, we propose a sub classification of cluster D-I SBPs into (i) cluster D-I(a)-monosaccharide-binding SBPs and (ii) cluster D-I(b)-oligosaccharide-binding SBPs. This study also provides the direct structural and functional correlation indicating that divergence of proteins may occur through insertions or deletions of sequences in the already existing SBPs leading to evolution at the functional level.

AB Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly regulated cytosolic enzyme situated at a crucial branch point of central plant metabolism. The structure of AtPPC3, a C-3 PEPC isozyme of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, in complex with the inhibitors aspartate and citrate was solved at 2.2-angstrom resolution. This represents the first PEPC structure with citrate bound. Aspartate and citrate binding sites are in close proximity (5.1-5.3 angstrom) and interactions between citrate and specific residues were identified. Citrate functions as a mixed (allosteric) inhibitor as it reduced AtPPC3's V-max while increasing K-m(PEP) values. The PEP saturation data gave an excellent fit to the mixed inhibition model, yielding K-i and K-i' (citrate) values of 9.3 and 42.5 mM, respectively. Citrate and aspartate inhibition of AtPPC3 was non-additive, likely due to their closely positioned binding sites, their similar negative charge, and type of binding residues. Fewer interactions and lower affinity for citrate support its observed weaker inhibition of AtPPC3 relative to aspartate. Citrate does not appear to induce further conformational change beyond aspartate owing to the similar structural mechanism of inhibition. AtPPC3 largely exhibits root-specific expression in Arabidopsis, where it is markedly upregulated during stresses such as excessive salinity or nutritional P-i deprivation that necessitate large increases in anaplerotic PEP carboxylation. The cytosolic citrate concentration of potato tubers suggests that AtPPC3's inhibition by citrate may be physiologically relevant. Our results provide novel insights into the structural basis of allosteric PEPC control and the kinetic effects brought about upon inhibitor binding.

AB DcrB is an 18 kDa lipoprotein that contains a single domain of unknown function. DcrB is found within Enterobacteriaceae, a family of Gram-negative bacteria which includes pathogens that can cause food-borne illness and hospital-acquired infections. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, DcrB is up-regulated by conditions that promote the production of known virulence factors. We determined the structure of a truncated form of DcrB from Salmonella to 1.92 angstrom resolution by X-ray crystallography. This truncated form, DcrB Delta 37, contains the entire domain of unknown function but lacks the lipoprotein signal sequence (residues 1-20) as well as residues 21-37. The DcrB Delta 37 monomer contains the Mog1p/PsbP-like fold, which is found in functionally diverse proteins in mammals, yeast, plants, and cyanobacteria. Interestingly, DcrB Delta 37 crystallized as a domain swapped homodimer in which the N-terminal beta-hairpin extends from one protomer to interact with the core of the second protomer. This domain-swapping indicates that the N-terminal portion of the Mog1p/PsbP-like fold likely has conformational flexibility. Overall, our results provide the first example of an enterobacterial protein that contains the Mog1p/PsbP-like fold and expands knowledge of the structural and phylogenetic diversity of Mog1p/PsbP-like proteins.

TI Crystal structure of a biliverdin-bound phycobiliprotein:
   Interdependence of oligomerization and chromophorylation
SO JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

ID FLUORESCENT; ALLOPHYCOCYANIN
AB Small, ultra-red fluorescence protein (smURFP) introduces the non-native biliverdin (BV) chromophore to phycobiliproteins (PBPs), allowing them to be used as transgenic labels for in vivo mammalian imaging. Presently, no structural information exists for PBPs bound to the non-native BV chromophore, which limits the further development of smURFP and related proteins as imaging labels or indicators. Here we describe the first crystal structure of a PBP bound to BV. The structures of smURFP-Y56R with BV and smURFP-Y56F without BV reveal unique oligomerization interfaces different from those in wild-type PBPs bound to native chromophores. Our structures suggest that the oligomerization interface affects the BV binding site, creating a link between oligomerization and chromophorylation that we confirmed through site-directed mutagenesis and that may help guide efforts to improve the notorious chromophorylation of smURFP and other PBPs engineered to bind BV.

AB We present a multiscale reconstruction framework for single-particle analysis (SPA). The representation of three-dimensional (3D) objects with scaled basis functions permits the reconstruction of volumes at any desired scale in the real-space. This multiscale approach generates interesting opportunities in SPA for the stabilization of the initial volume problem or the 3D iterative refinement procedure. In particular, we show that reconstructions performed at coarse scale are more robust to angular errors and permit gains in computational speed. A key component of the proposed iterative scheme is its fast implementation. The costly step of reconstruction, which was previously hindering the use of advanced iterative methods in SPA, is formulated as a discrete convolution with a cost that does not depend on the number of projection directions. The inclusion of the contrast transfer function inside the imaging matrix is also done at no extra computational cost. By permitting full 3D regularization, the framework is by itself a robust alternative to direct methods for performing reconstruction in adverse imaging conditions (e.g., heavy noise, large angular misassignments, low number of projections). We present reconstructions obtained at different scales from a dataset of the 2015/2016 EMDataBank Map Challenge. The algorithm has been implemented in the Scipion package.

AB With the rapidly growing number of macromolecular structures solved to near-atomic resolution using electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM), map interpretation and model building directly from the density without the use of structural templates has become increasingly important. As part of the 2015/2016 Map and Model Challenge, we attempted to assess our latest de novo modeling tool, Pathwalking, in terms of performance and usability, as well as identify areas for future improvements. In total, we applied Pathwalking to six density maps between 3 and 4.5 A resolution selected from the challenge data sets. In five of the six cases, Pathwalking was able to accurately determine the protein fold and in three of these cases, the final all atom model had less than 1.6A RMSD when compared to the known structure. Model building and refinement was nearly completely automated, used default parameters and took less than 30 min to complete a refined all atom model. A direct outgrowth of this work was a more streamlined automated command line Pathwalking utility, as well as a novel sequence assignment and optimization routine, which attempts to register sidechain density with expected side chain volume. In total, Pathwalking offers a nearly complete, robust and efficient method for constructing atomistic protein structures directly from a density map without the aid of a template

AB We introduce a new method for assessing resolvability of structural features in density maps from Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) using fitted or derived models. It calculates Z-scores for secondary structure elements (SSEs) and side chains. Z-scores capture how much larger the cross-correlation score (CCS) is for atoms in such features at their placed locations compared to the CCS at displaced positions. Z-scores are larger when the structural features are well-resolved, as confirmed by visual analysis. This method was applied to all 66 maps submitted to the 2015/2016 EMDB map challenge. For each map, the fitted model provided by the map committee was used in this assessment. The average Z-scores for each map and fitted model correlate moderately well with reported map resolutions (r(2) = 0.45 for SSE Z-scores and r(2) = 0.56 for side chain Z-scores). Rankings of the submitted maps based on average Z-scores seem to more closely agree with visual analysis. Z-scores can also be used to pinpoint which parts of a model are well-resolved in a map, and which parts of the model may need further fitting or refinement to make the model better match the density.

AB Short polyserine (polyS) repeats are frequently found in proteins and longer ones are produced in neurological disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) owing to translational frameshifting or non-ATG-dependent translation, together with polyglutamine (polyQ) and polyalanine (polyA) repeats, forming intracellular aggregates. However, the physiological and pathological structures of polyS repeats are not clearly understood. Early studies highlighted their structural versatility, similar to other homopolymers whose conformation is influenced by the surrounding protein context. As polyS stretches are frequently near polyQ and polyA repeats, which can be part of coiled coil (CC) structures, and the frameshift-derived polyS repeats in HD directly flank CC heptads important for aggregation, we investigate here the structural and aggregation properties of polyS in the context of CC structures. We have taken advantage of peptide models, previously used to study polyQ and polyA in CCs, in which we inserted polyS repeats of variable length and studied them in comparison with polyQ and polyA peptides. We found that polyS repeats promote CC-mediated polymerization and fibrillization as revealed by circular dichroism, chemical crosslinking, and atomic force microscopy. Furthermore, they promote CC-based, length-dependent intracellular aggregation, which is negligible with 7 and widespread with 49 serines. These findings show that polyS repeats can participate in the formation of CCs, as previously found for polyQ and polyA, conferring to peptides distinctive structural properties with aggregation kinetics that are intermediate between those of polyA and polyQ CCs, and contribute to an overall structural definition of the pathophysiogical roles of homopolymeric repeats in CC structures.

AB The process of learning candidate causal relationships involving diseases and symptoms from electronic medical records (EMRs) is the first step towards learning models that perform diagnostic inference directly from real healthcare data. However, the existing diagnostic inference systems rely on knowledge bases such as ontology that are manually compiled through a labour-intensive process or automatically derived using simple pairwise statistics. We explore CBN, a Clinical Bayesian Network construction for medical ontology probabilistic inference, to learn high-quality Bayesian topology and complete ontology directly from EMRs. Specifically, we first extract medical entity relationships from over 10,000 deidentified patient records and adopt the odds ratio (OR value) calculation and the K2 greedy algorithm to automatically construct a Bayesian topology. Then, Bayesian estimation is used for the probability distribution. Finally, we employ a Bayesian network to complete the causal relationship and probability distribution of ontology to enhance the ontology inference capability. By evaluating the learned topology versus the expert opinions of physicians and entropy calculations and by calculating the ontology-based diagnosis classification, our study demonstrates that the direct and automated construction of a high-quality health topology and ontology from medical records is feasible.
   Our results are reproducible, and we will release the source code and CN-Stroke knowledge graph of this work after publication.

   DOCUMENTATION
AB The importance of incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in clinical informatics research has been increasingly recognized over the past years, and has led to transformative advances.
   Typically, clinical NLP systems are developed and evaluated on word, sentence, or document level annotations that model specific attributes and features, such as document content (e.g., patient status, or report type), document section types (e.g., current medications, past medical history, or discharge summary), named entities and concepts (e.g., diagnoses, symptoms, or treatments) or semantic attributes (e.g., negation, severity, or temporality).
   From a clinical perspective, on the other hand, research studies are typically modelled and evaluated on a patient-or population-level, such as predicting how a patient group might respond to specific treatments or patient monitoring over time. While some NLP tasks consider predictions at the individual or group user level, these tasks still constitute a minority. Owing to the discrepancy between scientific objectives of each field, and because of differences in methodological evaluation priorities, there is no clear alignment between these evaluation approaches.
   Here we provide a broad summary and outline of the challenging issues involved in defining appropriate intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods for NLP research that is to be used for clinical outcomes research, and vice versa. A particular focus is placed on mental health research, an area still relatively understudied by the clinical NLP research community, but where NLP methods are of notable relevance. Recent advances in clinical NLP method development have been significant, but we propose more emphasis needs to be placed on rigorous evaluation for the field to advance further. To enable this, we provide actionable suggestions, including a minimal protocol that could be used when reporting clinical NLP method development and its evaluation.

AB Purpose: We explored the mechanism of aspirin in SCLC by dissecting many publicly available databases.
   Methods and results: Firstly, 11 direct protein targets (DPTs) of aspirin were identified by DrugBank 5.0. Then protein protein interaction (PPI) network and signaling pathways of aspirin DPTs were analyzed. We found that aspirin was linked with many kinds of cancer, and the most significant one is SCLC. Next, we classified the mutation of 4 aspirin DPTs in SCLC (IKBKB, NFKBIA, PTGS2 and TP53) using cBio Portal. Further, we identified top 50 overexpressed genes of SCLC by Oncomine, and the interconnected genes with the 4 aspirin DPTs in SCLC (IKBKB, NFKBIA, PTGS2 and TP53) by STRING. Lastly, we figured out 5 consistently genes as potential therapeutic targets of aspirin in SCLC.
   Conclusion: The integrated bioinformatical analysis could improve our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism about how aspirin working in SCLC. Integrated bioinformatical analysis may be considered as a new paradigm for guiding future studies about interaction in drugs and diseases.

AB Introduction: Comorbidity is common in elderly patients and it imposes heavy burden on both individual and the whole healthcare system. This study aims to gain insights of comorbidity development by simulating the lifetime trajectory of disease progression from single chronic disease to comorbidity.
   Methods: Eight health states spanning from no chronic condition to comorbidity are considered in this study. Disease progression network is constructed based on the seven-year retrospective data of around 700,000 residents living in Singapore central region. Microsimulation is applied to simulate the process of aging and disease progression of a synthetic new-bom cohort for the entire lifetime.
   Results: Among the 40 unique trajectories observed from the simulation, the top 10 trajectories covers 60% of the cohort. Timespan of most trajectories from birth to death is 80 years. Most people progress to at risk at late 30 s, develop the first chronic condition at 50 s or 60 s, and then progress to complications at 70 s. It is also observed that the earlier one person develops chronic conditions, the more life-year-lost is incurred.
   Discussion: The lifetime disease progression trajectory constructed for each person in the cohort describes how a person starts healthy, becomes at risk, then progresses to one or more chronic conditions, and finally deteriorates to various complications over the years. This study may help us have a better understanding of chronic disease progression and comorbidity development, hence add values to chronic disease prevention and management.

AB Computer applications for diagnostic medical imaging provide generally a wide range of tools to support physicians in their daily diagnosis activities. Unfortunately, some functionalities are specialized for specific diseases or imaging modalities, while other ones are useless for the images under investigation. Nevertheless, the corresponding Graphical User Interface (GUI) widgets are still present on the screen reducing the image visualization area. As a consequence, the physician may be affected by cognitive overload and visual stress causing a degradation of performances, mainly due to unuseful widgets. In clinical environments, a GUI must represent a sequence of steps for image investigation following a well-defined workflow. This paper proposes a software framework aimed at addressing the issues outlined before. Specifically, we designed a DICOM based mechanism of data-driven GUI generation, referring to the examined body part and imaging modality as well as to the medical image analysis task to perform. In this way, the self-configuring GUI is generated on-the-fly, so that just specific functionalities are active according to the current clinical scenario. Such a solution provides also a tight integration with the DICOM standard, which considers various aspects of the technology in medicine but does not address GUI specification issues. The proposed workflow is designed for diagnostic workstations with a local file system on an interchange media acting inside or outside the hospital ward. Accordingly, the DICOMDIR conceptual data model, defined by a hierarchical structure, is exploited and extended to include the GUI information thanks to a new Information Object Module (IOM), which reuses the DICOM information model. The proposed framework exploits the DICOM standard representing an enabling technology for an auto-consistent solution in medical diagnostic applications.

AB Automatic text summarizers can reduce the time required to read lengthy text documents by extracting the most important parts. Multi-document summarizers should produce a summary that covers the main topics of multiple related input texts to diminish the extent of redundant information. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization method named Clustering and Itemset mining based Biomedical Summarizer (CIBS). The summarizer extracts biomedical concepts from the input documents and employs an itemset mining algorithm to discover main topics. Then, it applies a clustering algorithm to put the sentences into clusters such that those in the same cluster share similar topics. Selecting sentences from all the clusters, the summarizer can produce a summary that covers a wide range of topics of the input text. Using the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) toolkit, we evaluate the performance of the CIBS method against four summarizers including a state-of-the-art method. The results show that the CIBS method can improve the performance of single- and multi-document biomedical text summarization. It is shown that the topic-based sentence clustering approach can be effectively used to increase the informative content of summaries, as well as to decrease the redundant information.

AB Background: Previous research has developed methods to construct acronym sense inventories from a single institutional corpus. Although beneficial, a sense inventory constructed from a single institutional corpus is not generalizable, because acronyms from different geographic regions and medical specialties vary greatly.
   Objective: Develop an automated method to harmonize sense inventories from different regions and specialties towards the development of a comprehensive inventory.
   Methods: The method involves integrating multiple source sense inventories into one centralized inventory and cross-mapping redundant entries to establish synonymy. To evaluate our method, we integrated 8 well-known source inventories into one comprehensive inventory (or metathesaurus). For both the metathesaurus and its sources, we evaluated the coverage of acronyms and their senses on a corpus of 1 million clinical notes. The corpus came from a different institution, region, and specialty than the source inventories.
   Results: In the evaluation using clinical notes, the metathesaurus demonstrated an acronym (short form) micro coverage of 94.3%, representing a substantial increase over the two next largest source inventories, the UMLS LRABR (74.8%) and ADAM (68.0%). The metathesaurus demonstrated a sense (long form) micro-coverage of 99.6%, again a substantial increase compared to the UMLS LRABR (82.5%) and ADAM (55.4%).
   Conclusions: Given the high coverage, harmonizing acronym sense inventories is a promising methodology to improve their comprehensiveness. Our method is automated, leverages the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution-specific inventories in the United States, and may help generalize sense inventories to institutions who lack the resources to develop them. Future work should address quality issues in source inventories and explore additional approaches to establishing synonymy.

AB Background: One of the significant problems in the field of healthcare is the low survival rate of people who have experienced sudden cardiac arrest. Early prediction of cardiac arrest can provide the time required for intervening and preventing its onset in order to reduce mortality. Traditional statistical methods have been used to predict cardiac arrest. They have often analyzed group-level differences using a limited number of variables. On the other hand, machine learning approach, which is part of a growing trend of predictive medical analysis, has provided personalized predictive analyses on more complex data and produced remarkable results.
   Objective: This paper has two aims. First, it offers a systematic review to evaluate the capability and performance of machine learning techniques in predicting the risk of cardiac arrest. Second, it offers an integrative framework to synthesize the researches in this field.
   Method. A systematic review of cardiac arrest prediction studies was carried out through Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and SpringerLink databases. These studies used machine learning techniques and were conducted between the years 2000 and 2018.
   Results: From a total of 1617 papers retrieved from the literature search, 75 studies were included in the final analysis. In order to explore how machine learning techniques were employed to predict cardiac arrest, a multi layered framework was proposed. Each layer of the framework represents a classification of the current literature and contains taxonomies of relevant observed information. The framework integrates these classifications and illustrates the relative influence of a layer on other layers. The included papers were analyzed and synthesized through this framework. The used machine learning techniques were evaluated in terms of application and efficiency. The results illustrated the prediction capability of machine learning methods in predicting cardiac arrest.
   Conclusion: According to the results, machine learning techniques can improve the outcome of cardiac arrest prediction. However, future research should be carried out to evaluate the efficiency of rarely-used algorithms and to address the challenges of external validation, implementation and adoption of machine learning models in real clinical environments.

ID GEOMETRIC FRAMEWORK; LABEL PROPAGATION
AB Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is one of the most important tasks in drug discovery. Prediction of potential DDIs helps to reduce unexpected side effects in the lifecycle of drugs, and is important for the drug safety surveillance. Here, we formulate the drug-drug interaction prediction as a matrix completion task, and project drugs in the interaction space into a low-dimensional space. We consider drug features, i.e., substructures, targets, enzymes, transporters, pathways, indications, side effects, and off side effects, to calculate drug-drug similarities, and assume them as manifolds in feature spaces. In this paper, we present a novel computational method named "Manifold Regularized Matrix Factorization" (MRMF) to predict potential drug-drug interactions, by introducing the drug feature-based manifold regularization into the matrix factorization. In the computational experiments, the MRMF models, which utilize known drug-drug interactions and the drug feature-based manifold, produce the area under precision-recall curves (AUPR) up to 0.7963. We test manifold regularizations based on different drug features, and the MRMF models can produce robust performances. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the MRMF models can produce better performances in the cross validation and case study. The manifold regularization is the critical factor for the high-accuracy performances of our method. MRMF is promising and effective for the prediction of drug-drug interactions.

   Clinical notes; Text mining; Data science; Natural language processing
ID SOCIAL MEDIA; TWITTER
AB Background: Data collection and extraction from noisy text sources such as social media typically rely on keyword-based searching/listening. However, health-related terms are often misspelled in such noisy text sources due to their complex morphology, resulting in the exclusion of relevant data for studies. In this paper, we present a customizable data-centric system that automatically generates common misspellings for complex health-related terms, which can improve the data collection process from noisy text sources.
   Materials and methods: The spelling variant generator relies on a dense vector model learned from large, unlabeled text, which is used to find semantically close terms to the original/seed keyword, followed by the filtering of terms that are lexically dissimilar beyond a given threshold. The process is executed recursively, converging when no new terms similar (lexically and semantically) to the seed keyword are found. The weighting of intra-word character sequence similarities allows further problem-specific customization of the system.
   Results: On a dataset prepared for this study, our system outperforms the current state-of-the-art medication name variant generator with best F-1 score of 0.69 and F-1/4 - score of 0.78. Extrinsic evaluation of the system on a set of cancer-related terms demonstrated an increase of over 67% in retrieval rate from Twitter posts when the generated variants are included.
   Discussion. Our proposed spelling variant generator has several advantages over past spelling variant generators - (i) it is capable of filtering out lexically similar but semantically dissimilar terms, (ii) the number of variants generated is low, as many low-frequency and ambiguous misspellings are filtered out, and (iii) the system is fully automatic, customizable and easily executable. While the base system is fully unsupervised, we show how supervision may be employed to adjust weights for task-specific customizations.
   Conclusion: The performance and relative simplicity of our proposed approach make it a much-needed spelling variant generation resource for health-related text mining from noisy sources. The source code for the system has been made publicly available for research.

AB Water inrush incidents threaten the safety of coal mining. Understanding of hydrogeologic parameter distributions is critical for preventing water-related hazards in coal mines. During the deep mining ( > 1000 m) under the North China Plain, water from water-bearing strata discharges into coal seams through geologic conduits (i.e. water inrush) due to the fractured zone under the floor of working faces. In this study, a water inrush incident was exploited as an active stimulus. A 3D groundwater flow model was built for the eighth member of the Middle Ordovician system in Xingdong coal mine. Using this model and an inverse approach, we first checked if the data from the incident and an independent pumping test carry non-redundant information about the heterogeneity of the mine. Afterward, we combined these datasets to conduct a large-scale (approximately 10 km) hydraulic tomography (HT) analysis. The estimated hydraulic conductivity distribution from the HT analysis is found consistent with the distribution of known geologic faults. That is, a cluster of faults is characterized as a high-conductivity zone. A high conductivity zone is identified at locations close to the water inrush location, which is the high cement consumption zone during the grouting project. Finally, results of this study promote exploiting the water inrush events as a HT survey for mapping geologic structures over a large area.

To investigate soil properties impacting hydrological processes, five conventional pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) are applied to create a 3D soil hydraulic parameter (SHP) ensemble in the Weather Research and Forecasting-Hydrological extension (WRF-Hydro), a distributed, multi-physics land surface hydrological model. The SHPs are generated, based on a high-resolution Chinese soil property dataset, over the heterogeneous Upper Huaihe River basin. The results show that the SHPs can influence the streamflow in WRF-Hydro, which is similar to the impact of the scaling parameters on the streamflow over the study basin. Analyses of the uncertainty in the SHP ensemble reveal that SHPs mainly constrain the peak flow during the flood rise and impact the baseflow during the flood recession. A hydrological Bayesian model average (BMA) method is constructed to postprocess the streamflow ensemble based on the 3D SHPs. Probabilistic streamflow estimations by the BMA method are more skillful than the simulations using the individual 3D SHP ensemble members for all five studied hydrological stations, especially for high flows. Therefore, improved estimation of the uncertainty in the 3D SHPs may enhance the spatial representation of flood processes, resulting in more accurate estimates of the streamflow in the main streams in a heterogeneous basin.

AB This study develops a novel approach to data-driven hydrological modeling. The approach adopts the feature representation technique in computer vision to effectively exploit spatial information contained in time-variant input data fields and seamlessly fuse multisource information via machine learning. The new approach overcomes a major limitation of existing approaches in which the spatial heterogeneity of input variables cannot be sufficiently accounted for. The approach is applied to predict the streamflow in a watershed on the northern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and its performance is compared with various data-driven and process-based models. The major findings are as follows. First, the new approach represents a general framework for the fusion of multisource spatiotemporal data for hydrological modeling and demonstrates great potential to incorporate fast-growing environmental big data. Second, the new approach demonstrates satisfactory short-term forecasting, long-term simulation, and transfer learning performances and is promising for addressing predictions in ungauged basins. Third, the predictors, including precipitation, temperature, leaf area index, and historical streamflow, play markedly distinct roles in modeling streamflow with the novel approach. Finally, topographic information is not a necessary model input in the proposed approach because spatial patterns can be well embodied by other inputs (e.g., temperature) that have high similarities with topography. This study represents the first attempt to bring computer vision into data-driven hydrological modeling and may inspire future studies in this promising direction.

AB Many urbanized areas in the world are using artificial recharge basins (ARB) as an efficient solution to maintain adequate groundwater recharge while coping with flooding problems. The effective management of these basins to adequately maintain their functionality over mid-to-long term requires a suitable monitoring network. Here, we explored the use of a temporal satellite analysis to closely evaluate the efficiency of the ARB in terms of infiltration capacity, depending on hydraulic conditions of the topsoil transitioning from unclogged to clogged conditions in the ARB.
   COSMO-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were integrated with ground data and numerical modeling to advance the capability for monitoring low water levels and flooded areas within the ARB. The understanding of biofilm development and effects was achieved by identifying anomalous drawdown phases, by constraining ponding boundary conditions in the numerical model, and by estimating subsequent infiltration rate changes under progressive clogging.
   With appropriate meteorological conditions (consecutive rainfall events separated by few dry days), the biofilm could develop rapidly and cover large surfaces (e.g., 22 ha) in about two months. During this process, the hydraulic conductivity of the basin surface could decrease by more than three orders of magnitude, completely altering the relationship with the local groundwater regime. Quantitative estimation of the evolution of the infiltration rate provides crucial insights about the overall recharge behavior of ARBs to make reliable economical plans in both the design and monitoring phase.

AB In this paper, a mathematical model for conflict resolution among a diverse set of agricultural water users in Golestan province, Iran, is developed. Given the bi-level nature of the distribution of power in the current problem, a combination of Leader-Follower game and Nash-Harsanyi bargaining solution method is employed to find optimal water and crop area allocations. The Golestan Regional Water Authority is the leader in this setting, controlling the total water allocations; and the agricultural sectors are the followers, competing over the allocated water. Two objectives for the leader are (i) maximizing profits, and (ii) maximizing share of green water in total agricultural production through selecting more efficient crop patterns. The followers' objective is merely maximizing obtained benefits for the selected crop patterns. Virtual water concept is also factored into the related objective functions, and the water allocation problem is solved considering spatio-temporal crop pattern along with a dynamic water pricing system. This involves using a hybrid optimization structure as a new approach to solving two level optimization problems. The results show that the leader's income is independent of total water allocation and is only affected by crop pattern and crop area, two factors which drive water price too. The followers' benefit also depends on crop pattern and crop area, as they influence the crop yield, cost and water price. Finally, green water plays a key role in selecting the optimal crop pattern and crop area.

AB The Yarlung Zangbo-Brahmaputra - Jamuna river basin (further referred to as Brahmaputra River Basin) is one of the most important river systems in South Asia. It originates on the Tibetan Plateau and links Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, and India. Despite being an important river system of South Asia, with an immense potential for regional development, very little progress has been made so far at regional level to manage this transboundary river. Apart from stereotypical upstream-downstream syndromes, a lack of trust, an atmosphere of hostility, and an asymmetric information and power situation as also the absence of regional principles or frameworks make transboundary interaction between the Brahmaputra riparian countries complex and challenging. The lack of information and knowledge regarding the river itself makes decision-making further complicated. Negotiation for a basin-wide treaty on cooperation in the absence of trust is a non-starter for the Brahmaputra basin, for it may result in asymmetric cooperation, opening up ground for future conflicts. To avoid such asymmetric cooperation, information-rich, multilateral informal dialogues need to take place to develop an accepted definition of cooperation, which meets the needs of all riparian states.
   The article provides an outline of the current issues in the Brahmaputra river basin and illustrates the need for multitrack and multi-stakeholder dialogues in the Brahmaputra region. The paper is inspired by the 'Brahmaputra Dialogue' project initiated in 2013, that demonstrates that water diplomacy has to be an inclusive, open, and transparent process involving multiple actors, because such interaction facilitates sustainable water cooperation, not only between riparian countries but also between riparian communities.

AB The identification of storm tracks that generate the annual maximum floods and the quantification of their air-moisture content is proposed to understand better the atmospheric generation processes of floods in Spain, as well as their decreasing trends identified previously. In this work, the role of the atmospheric component on hydrological changes on Spain by using storm track data generated by the hybrid single particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory model (HYSPLIT) is examined. Storm tracks associated with annual maximum flood series from 14 streamflow gauges located across Spain are obtained by using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data. They are classified into five clusters through use of the K-means algorithm. It was also shown that the use of five clusters was able to reproduce the five major types of storms identified in Spain reported in the literature. The posterior grouping of the five associated storm types into two bigger groups (Oceanic and Continental storms), led to a coherent seasonal and spatial behaviour of hydrological regimes. For some gauges, it was observed that distinct flood statistics, such as mean and variance, differ significantly as a result of atmospherically distinct generation processes, suggesting that local annual maximum flood series may be non-homogeneous as a result of contrasting atmospheric generation processes. By means of logistic regression, it is estimated that the probability of occurrence of Oceanic storms reduced significantly in the Spanish Atlantic region along the studied period. Furthermore, the existence of low-frequency cycles introduces significant variation in the occurrence of storm types in the country, with them being much more frequent during the period 1975-1979, while Oceanic storms were more frequent during the 1983-1987 and 1996-1999 periods. Those storms classified as Continental are observed in 59.3% of the studied cases, while those termed Oceanic in 40.7%. Continental storms also contribute with more moisture in the studied cases, that is to say, 63.1% of total moisture content, while Oceanic storms contributed with 36.9%.

AB Thermal regime and its response to meteorological and hydrological forcings play an important role in controlling water quality and ecosystem of lakes. Many large floodplain lakes are subjected to significant river-lake interactions and could benefit greatly from hydrodynamic modeling. The current work presents a first attempt to use a 3D hydrodynamic model and statistical methods to explore spatiotemporal variations and primary causal factors of thermal stability within a large river-lake-floodplain system (Poyang Lake, China). The hydrodynamic model successfully reproduced the lake hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics through a comparative analysis of field measurements. Simulation results revealed that the thermal stability of Poyang Lake exhibits similar spatial patterns between seasons; however, the lake is generally stratified during summer and early autumn. It is classified as partial mixed and full mixed during winter and spring. The thermal stratification may develop in the center area and eastern bay area of the lake, while the full mixing is likely to occur in the floodplains and the main flow channels. Statistics and simulations indicate that the air temperature, solar radiation and evaporation trigger a positive effect on the thermal stability of Poyang Lake, whereas a negative relationship is recognized due to the catchment river temperature. The responses of thermal stability to the meteorological and hydrological changes are much stronger in summer than other seasons, producing a significant seasonal thermal regime in the floodplain lake. Additionally, the dynamics in the lake water depth and associated hydrological regime are a major factor in maintaining the seasonal thermal stability of Poyang Lake. The findings of this study can support management of Poyang Lake as well as other similar floodplain lakes, by providing information on both water quality and ecosystem succession.

For this purpose, 8 precipitations were selected from the Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves of the study area with a return period of 2 and 5 years. The deep percolation of these precipitations were examined in lysimeters with gravel, sand and mixed mulches and without any mulch. Then 192 data of soil moisture, daily maximum air-temperature and deep percolation were measured for driving empirical equations. Moreover, the efficiency and accuracy of these empirical equations were investigated using Coefficient of Determination (CD) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSEC). The results showed that the obtained empirical equations could estimate deep percolation and evaporation with an acceptable accuracy. Using these equations and the soil-water balance equation, a soil moisture model was developed for the assessment of deep percolation. Then it was examined to evaluate the efficiency of the mulched soils in increasing soil moisture and aquifer recharging of three years' precipitations in Shahrekord plain, Iran. The results showed that the deep percolation increased in all examined mulched soils compared to unmulched soil, its maximum and cumulative increase were in gravel mulch with 21.3% and 30%, respectively. Furthermore, groundwater modeling results showed that the mulching could improve groundwater level as 0.34 m over a three year period. Finally, this paper proposes soil mulching for enhancing groundwater resources and a model to assess it.

AB Water diplomacy needs institutional anchoring. International River Basin Organizations (RBOs) - being the result of diplomatic efforts by riparian states intending to create a framework for cooperation between themselves over shared water bodies - can provide such institutional anchors. RBOs ensure that agreements to cooperate are turned into a long-term commitment by riparian states to jointly manage shared water resources and, in turn, foster mutually beneficial cooperation over time. RBOs have been the subject of detailed examinations of their conceptual core, of their manifold functions, of their effectiveness in achieving their goals and so forth. However, the legal nature of these entities has so far received limited attention notwithstanding its significance in empowering RBOs to act as institutional anchors for water diplomacy. Legitimate questions arise, for instance, in relation to their legal personality, or lack thereof, or to matters such as immunities and privileges. This paper will review key legal aspects of RBOs and illustrate them with examples. A sound understanding of such issues is crucial to supporting fruitful discussions between state members about the legal design of an RBO in order to fulfill their particular needs in the context of water diplomacy.

AB The practice of stormwater infiltration is widely used to reduce the amount of urban stormwater runoff delivered to drainage systems and receiving waters. In theory, the practice recharges groundwater, leading to increased urban stream baseflow. In reality, however, little is known about the fate of infiltrated stormwater. Because urban groundwater pathways are numerous and the interactions with subsurface infrastructure (e.g. trenches, pipes, etc.) are highly complex, the spatial and temporal variability of the contribution of infiltrated stormwater to baseflow is difficult to predict. We tracked the fate of infiltrated stormwater out of an 1800 m(2) infiltration basin (3.5% of its 5-ha impervious catchment) using a network of piezometers for over three years. We found that groundwater levels downslope of the basin were increased (up to 4 m) while water levels in an array of reference piezometers lateral to the basin showed no change (dry at depths ranging 2-4 m). Monthly water balance calculations indicated that in summer, most of the infiltrated stormwater was evapotranspired by the vegetation downslope of the basin, and thus did not reach the receiving stream. In the colder months, some infiltrated stormwater did reach the stream as plant water use declined. Anthropogenic disturbances (a sewer pipe and stream re-alignment) interacted with the upper part of the plume of infiltrated stormwater, locally lowering the water table. The study provides evidence that the fate of infiltrated stormwater is complex, and that infiltrated stormwater does not always reach receiving streams as baseflow as is often assumed.

AB This study evaluates the utility of ambient temperature profiles collected in sealed bedrock boreholes to assess variability in groundwater flow in discretely fractured shallow bedrock environments. A conceptual model for groundwater flow and groundwater-surface water temperature conditions and their interaction in a temperate climate is developed through a statistical interpretation of time-lapse thermal deviation logs. Temperature profiles were collected in three angled and three vertical boreholes drilled to 24-32 mbgs (meters below ground surface) and temporarily sealed with an impermeable fabric liner in a fractured dolostone bedrock aquifer adjacent to and extending beneath a bedrock river to monitor seasonal hydrodynamics. Ambient borehole temperature profiles collected every 1-8 weeks over a 12 month period identified zones of hydraulic activity during periods of intra-seasonal stability without the interference of open borehole cross-connection. Signal cross-correlation and Fourier spectra analysis of thermal deviation logs provided a novel way to observe the shallow bedrock flow system's temperature evolution due to advection along discrete fractures in response to seasonal transience, and to identify and isolate noise caused by free-convection cells within the sealed borehole. This approach represents a diagnostic tool that improves confidence in identifying depth discrete, hydraulically active fracture zones from thermal deviation data sets in a shallow, fractured sedimentary bedrock environment. Variably scaled free-convection cells were observed within the borehole water columns during the colder winter periods. Although these periods were accompanied by higher signal noise near the river/atmospheric interface, these cells led to a temporary thermal disequilibrium between the borehole water column and formation water deeper in the bedrock. These conditions increased the maximum depth of thermal detections associated with discrete groundwater flow features from 14 mbgs in the summer to 26 mbgs in the winter, thereby enhancing the understanding of shallow groundwater flow systems under the direct influence of surface water.

AB Characterization of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) distribution is important to facilitate the decision of remediation strategies. However, it is still a great challenge to characterize DNAPL source zone architecture with high resolution due to subsurface heterogeneity and relatively sparse data from traditional hydrogeological investigations. To overcome difficulties from such sparse data, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is introduced to locate DNAPL using time-lapse cross-borehole measurements. Due to the significant impact of geological heterogeneity on DNAPL source zone architecture, a data assimilation framework based on the coupled multiphase fluids-ERT model is developed to jointly invert DNAPL saturation and the permeability field using time-lapse ERT data. To validate the efficiency and performance of this framework, synthetic and laboratory experiments are both performed to monitor DNAPL migration and distribution in 3D heterogeneous sandbox with cross-borehole ERT. Result shows that time-lapse ERT and direct inversion can map the evolution of the DNAPL plume but loses details regarding the plume morphology due to the over-smoothing caused by geophysical inversion using an isotropic and homogeneous roughness-based regularization procedure. By contrast, the coupled inversion is successful to characterize both the permeability field and the evolution of the DNAPL plume with a higher resolution. This is because the coupled inversion is able to directly translate raw geophysical data into hydrologic meaningful information and therefore avoid artifacts caused by direct geophysical inversion.

AB Suspended sediment has significant effects on reservoir storage capacity, the operation of hydraulic structures and river morphology. Hence, modeling suspended sediment loads (SSL) in rivers contributes to various water resource management and river engineering. An evaluation of stand-alone data mining models (i.e., reduced error pruning tree (REPT), M5P and instance-based learning (IBK)) and hybrid models, (i.e., bagging-M5P, random committee-REPT (RC-REPT) and random subspace-REPT (RS-REPT)) for predicting SSL resulting from glacial melting at an Andean catchment in Chile has been conducted in this study. The best input combinations are constructed based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of hourly SSL time series data with water discharge (Q), water temperature (T) and electrical conductivity (C) for different time lags. Seventy percent of the available data (one year of hourly data) is used to calibrate the models (dataset training) and the remaining 30% is used for model evaluation (dataset testing). The performances of the models are evaluated using several quantitative and graphical criteria, including coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percentage of bias (PBIAS), the ratio of RMSE to the standard deviation of observation (RSR), a Taylor diagram and a boxplot. All the models performed well in predicting SSL. However, the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank tests revealed that predicted SSL significantly differed for different models except between IBK (or M5P) and REPT. The hybrid models performed better than individual models. The bagging-M5P had the best predictive capability while the KEPT had the poorest.

AB Despite of diverse progressions in hydrological modeling techniques, the necessity of a robust, accurate, reliable, and trusted expert system for real-time stream flow prediction still exists. The intention of the present study is to establish a new complementary data-intelligence (DI) model called wavelet extreme learning machine (WAELM) for forecasting river flow in a semi-arid environment. The monthly river flow data for the period 1991-2010 is used to calibrate and validate the applied predictive model, developed using antecedent flow data as predictor. The prediction efficiency of the developed WA-ELM model is validated against stand-alone ELM model. The performance of the models is diagnosed using multiple statistical metrics and graphical analysis visualization. The results reveal that incorporation of data pre-processing wavelet approach with ELM model enhances the river flow predictability. In quantitative term, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) measurements are reduced by 65% and 67% using WA-ELM over ELM model, respectively. The Taylor diagram reveals much closer proximity and the Violin plot shows similar distribution of WA-ELM simulated river flow to the observed river flow compared to stand-alone ELM simulated river flow. The hybridization of wavelet decomposition method with ELM model improves the ability of ELM model to extract the required information for modeling the non-stationary and high stochastic river flow pattern. Overall, the study reveals that WA-ELM can be a reliable methodology for modeling river flow in semi-arid environment and for different regimes (i.e., low-, medium- and high-flow).

AB Region of influence is a common approach to estimate runoff information at ungauged locations. To estimate flood quantiles from annual maximum discharges, the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) framework has been recommended to account for unequal sampling variance and intersite correlation, which requires a proper evaluation of the sampling covariance structure. Since some jurisdictions do not have clear guidelines to perform this evaluation, a general procedure using copulas and a nonparametric intersite correlation model is investigated to estimate sampling covariance structure in situations where no common at-site distribution is imposed or when some paired sites do not have common periods of record. The investigated methodology is applied on 771 sites in Canada. The Normal copula is verified to be an adequate model that better fit paired observations than other types of extreme copulas. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the impact of either ignoring, or considering a simpler form of, intersite correlation. Additionally, super regions are defined based on drainage area and mean annual precipitation to improve the calibration of pooling groups across large territories and a wide range of climate conditions. Performance criteria based on cross-validation revealed that using super regions and a combination of geographic distance and similarity between catchment descriptors improves the calibration of the pooling groups by providing more accurate estimates.

AB In this study, we investigate changes in future streamflows in California using bias-corrected and routed streamflows derived from global climate model (GCM) simulations under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs): RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on the mean streamflow, annual maxima or seasonality, we focus on projected changes across the distribution of streamflow and the underlying causes. We report opposing trends in the two tails of the future streamflow simulations: lower low flows and higher high flows with no change in the overall mean of future flows relative to the historical baseline (statistically significant at 0.05 level). Furthermore, results show that streamflow is projected to increase during most of the rainy season (December to March) while it is expected to decrease in the rest of the year (i.e., wetter rainy seasons, and drier dry seasons). We argue that the projected changes to streamflow in California are driven by the expected changes to snow patterns and precipitation extremes in a warming climate. Changes to future low flows and extreme high flows can have significant implications for water resource planning, drought management, and infrastructure design and risk assessment.

AB Budyko-type models in hydrology are simple but efficient descriptions of the vegetation-mediated hydrologic cycle in catchments. Based on hypothesized similarities between vegetation and human water consumption interactions in terms of water demand, constraints, and system functioning as well as catchment processes and outcomes, a corresponding Budyko-type framework is proposed here for human water consumption at the catchment scale. To validate this framework, socioeconomic data (human water consumption and economic and agricultural structure data), as well as hydrometeorological data, for 51 human-impacted catchments located in 10 major river basins in China were assembled. The results demonstrate (1) similar observed patterns to the traditional Budyko curves, with two limits and a monotonous increase shape; (2) the same functional form and mathematical features of the derived Budyko-type equation. Parameters of the new Budyko-type model for human consumption are estimated and analyzed based on the concept of water productivity. This study suggests that the functioning of both social and hydrologic subsystems within catchment systems can be explored within a common conceptual framework, thus providing a unified socio-hydrologic basis for the study of human-water systems.

AB The Nierji Basin, in the north-east of China, is one of the most important basins in the joint operation of the entire Songhua River, containing a major reservoir used for flood control. It is necessary to forecast the flow of the basin during periods of flood accurately and with the maximum lead time possible. This paper presents a flood forecasting system, using the Data Based Mechanistic (DBM) modeling approach and Kalman Filter data assimilation for flood forecasting in the data limited Nierji Reservoir Basin (NIRB). Examples are given of the application of the DBM methodology using both single input (rainfall or upstream flow) and multiple input (rainfalls and upstream flow) to forecast the downstream discharge for different sub-basins. Model identification uses the simplified recursive instrumental variable (SRIV) algorithm, which is robust to noise in the observation data. The application is novel in its use of stochastic optimisation to define rain gauge weights and identify the power law nonlinearity. It is also the first application of the DBM methodology to flood forecasting in China. Using the methodology allows the forecasting with lead times of 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 4-day, 5-day with 98%, 97%, 96%, 96% and 93% forecast coefficient of determination respectively, which is sufficient for the regulation of the reservoirs in the basin.

AB The Floc Size Distributions (FSDs) of biomineral suspended particles are of great importance to understand the dynamics of bio-mediated Suspended Particulate Matters (SPMs). Field observations were investigated at Station MOW1 in Belgian coastal waters (southern North Sea) during two typical periods with abundant and reduced biomass. In addition, the Shen et al. (2018) [Water Res. Vol 145, pp 473-486] multi-class population balance flocculation model was extended to address the occurrence of suspended microflocs, macroflocs and megaflocs during these contrasting periods. The microflocs are treated as elementary particles that constitute macroflocs or megaflocs. The FSD is represented by the size and mass fraction of each particle group, which corresponds to a temporal and spatial varying mass weighted settling velocity. The representative sizes of macroflocs and megaflocs are unfixed and migrated between classes mainly due to the effects of turbulent shear, differential settling and biofilm growth. The growth of an aggregate because of bio-activities is allotted to each elementary particle. It is further hypothesized that the growth kinetics of biomineral particles due to biofllm coating follows the logistic equation. This simple bio-flocculation model has been successfully coupled in the open source TELEMAC modeling system with five passive tracers in a quasi-1D vertical case. Within an intra-tide scale, the settling velocity (w(s)) is large during slack tides while it is small during maximum current velocities because of variations in turbulence intensities. Nonetheless, the w(s), may be largely underestimated when the biological effect is neglected. For a seasonal pattern, the w(s), is higher in biomass-rich periods in May than in biomass-poor periods in October. While the mean sizes of megaflocs are close during the two periods, the macroflocs during algae bloom periods are more abundant with a larger mean size. This study enhances our knowledge on the dynamics of SPMs, especially the biophysical influences on the fate and transport of estuarine aggregates.

AB Groundwater overdraft due to extensive irrigation has led to a shallow aquifer depletion crisis in the Haihe River basin. Quantitative simulation of the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yield under different conditions of limited exploitation using a distributed hydrological model is important in the well-irrigated plain of this basin. Based on multiple modeling experiments by a modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, three limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat (Triacum aestivum L.) were selected as simulation scenarios. The simulated results using the SWAT model showed that under scenario 1 (applying two rounds of irrigation corresponding to the jointing and heading stages of winter wheat), the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 2/3 of that under the basic scenario (current irrigation schedule), but the winter wheat yield decreased by 13% compared with the basic scenario. Under scenario 2 (applying one round of irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat), the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 1/4 of that under the basic scenario, but the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario increased to 28%. The amount of overexploited shallow groundwater in the cropland area decreased from 17.5 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) (under the basic scenario) to 11.0 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) under scenario 1 and 4.5 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) under scenario 2. Under scenario 3 (rain-fed conditions during the winter wheat season), the regional variation in the shallow groundwater table shifted to a recovery trend with an average rate of 0.22 m a(-1), which was equivalent to restoring 3.5 x 10(8) m(3) a(-1) of shallow aquifer storage in the cropland area. However, the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario reached 54% under the rainfed scheme. Considering the trade-off between groundwater conservation and crop production under limited exploitation, linear programming was used to optimize the irrigation schedule at the subbasin scale. As a result, to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown, the average minimal reduction in the winter wheat yield would be 42% under the optimal irrigation schedule. By contrast, to satisfy the constraint of restricting the reduction in the crop yield to within the threshold required to maintain winter wheat self-sufficiency, the minimal rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table would be 0.26-0.52 m a(-1) under the optimal irrigation schedule. In addition, the uncertainty in the simulated shallow groundwater variation in this study was acceptable, indicating that the above assessments could provide reasonable references for regional groundwater management.

AB Hydrological models represent valuable tools to investigate the impacts of land use changes on water resources. Most commonly, distributed, physically-based models are applied for land use change impact studies in hydrology. However, providing a physically-based and detailed description of subsurface flows in karst systems is challenging. Lumped models, in contrast, are easy to implement and widely used in karst hydrological research, albeit not applicable for land use change impact studies. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new semi-distributed model LuKARS (Land use change modeling in KARSt systems) that lumps the predominant hydrotopes (i.e. distinct landscape units characterized by homogeneous hydrological properties as a result of similar land use and soil types) present in a catchment as independent, non-linear units. Flows from each hydrotope represent a specific response of the vadose zone (soil-epikarst-infiltration zone) in a defined recharge area. The saturated zone consists of a single linear storage unit recharged by each hydrotope independently. The main goal of this approach was to investigate land use change impacts in a dolomite karst system exploited for the water supply of the city of Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs (Austria) by changing the area covered by each hydrotope. Here, land use changes occured in the form of increasing spaces used for dolomite mining and at the expense of existing forest sites. With our parametrized model, we were able to reproduce the measured discharge in the largest spring of the Waidhofen karst system (Kerschbaum spring). Moreover, we succeeded in transferring the parametrized hydrotopes to other recharge areas (Hinterlug and Mitterlug) and validated the transferability of the modeling approach. Finally, we successfully showed the model's applicability for land use change impact studies by validating the calibrated model in a period in which the space of the dolomite quarries in the Kerschbaum recharge area almost doubled. The results of our study show that an increase of the dolomite quarries negatively affects the water supply of the city of Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs.

AB A frozen soil layer may impede snowmelt infiltration, resulting in a large amount of runoff that influences the soil water balance and anion movement in the soil profile. To examine the relationships among soil frost depth, snowmelt runoff, and nitrate leaching in agricultural fields, we measured both the snowmelt runoff for three winters and other environmental factors including the soil frost depth and nitrate content in a similar to 10,000 m(2) field. We divided the field into two subplots: one was maintained in a natural snow cover condition (the control plot), and the snow cover was compacted on the other plot (the treated plot) to enhance the development of the soil frost depth. In all three winters, soil frost depths in the control plot were < 0.2 m and very little runoff was observed during the snowmelt period. In contrast, the soil frost depth became > 0.4 m and a large amount of snowmelt runoff was observed in the treated plot. The depth of the peak nitrate concentration after the snowmelt period was shallower in the treated plot compared to the control plot. Moreover, a significant linear relationship was observed between (1) the amount of nitrate in the 0-0.3 m depth after the snowmelt period and (2) the total amount of snowmelt infiltration calculated by subtracting the amount of snowmelt runoff from the amount of snowmelt water. These results suggest that snow compaction can be a promising technique to develop a uniform soil frost depth in large-scale fields, which consequently controls the soil water and nutrient movement in the soil layer.

AB Informational entropy can be used to elucidate some important relationships between precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), and discharge over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Entropy does not suffer from any a priori assumptions of linearity or distributional characteristics. In a study of the Southeastern United States, entropy and mutual information were used to identify relationships between hydrologic variables over spatial scales from a few hundred to several thousand km(2) and temporal scales from days to months. Two distinct ET data sets were compared- one based on a highly parameterized energy budget approach and the other based on a complex iterative solution and a modified Penman method. It was found that there was a considerable difference in uncertainty between the two methods and that, although they each contained some amount of explanatory information regarding streamflow the more complex approach contained the most shared information. Further, it was found that streamflow entropy, or uncertainty, increased with drainage area, indicating that larger basins have more uncertainty to be reduced, in that more information can possibly be gained through the knowledge of other variables. However, the knowledge of ET reduces a greater proportion of uncertainty in smaller basins (< 1500 km(2)), while larger basins have more unexplained variability.

AB Fracture-scale heterogeneity plays an important role in driving dispersion, mixing and heat transfer in fractured rocks. Current approaches to characterize fracture scale flow and transport processes largely rely on indirect information based on the interpretation of tracer tests. Geophysical techniques used in parallel with tracer tests can offer time-lapse images indicative of the migration of electrically-conductive tracers away from the injection location. In this study, we present a methodology to invert time-lapse ground penetrating radar reflection monitoring data acquired during a push-pull tracer test to infer fracture-scale transport patterns and aperture distribution. We do this by using a probabilistic inversion based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. After demonstration on a synthetic dataset, we apply the new inversion method to field data. Our main findings are that the marginal distribution of local fracture apertures is well resolved and that the field site is characterized by strong flow channeling, which is consistent with interpretations of heat tracer tests in the same injection fracture.

TI Finland's cooperation in managing transboundary waters and the UNECE
   Principles for Effective Joint Bodies: Value for water diplomacy?
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE UNECE principles; Joint bodies; Transboundary waters; Water agreements;
   Water diplomacy
AB Water diplomacy may be understood broadly as the measures that may be taken to prevent or peacefully resolve conflicts over water resources concerning their availability, allocation or use between and within states. The concept is preventive in nature as well as offering an approach for conflict resolution. Instruments of international water law, among them notably conventions and soft law developed on that basis - which promote equitable and reasonable use of transboundary waters and prevention of transboundary impact - can serve as tools for water diplomacy. The obligation to establish agreements on shared waters and joint bodies to govern them has contributed to gathering important experience, and some of this has been synthesized into the Principles for Effective Joint Bodies which were adopted by the Meeting of the Parties to the UNECE Water Convention in 2015. The Principles are intended as a resource to increase the effectiveness of joint bodies in transboundary water cooperation.
   This paper analyses Finland's cooperation arrangements in the light of the Principles and assesses the extent to which Finland's transboundary water commissions reflect the good practices specified in the Principles. Taking a wider perspective, the paper also examines the elements of the principles and their practical realisation with a view to understanding better their promotion of water diplomacy. Relevant features include, inter alia, the competency and representation of the joint institution, its accountability and the extent to which public participation is permitted, and the cooperative mechanisms in place. Naturally the underlying transboundary water agreements specify the framework for cooperation between the riparian states to a great extent, but the established joint bodies often play a significant role, specifically in the equitable use and management of the shared water resources, but even beyond, in the prevention and settling of conflicts, and in the general promotion of cooperation and security at a regional level.

AB The compound dry and hot event has attracted much attention in recent decades due to their disastrous impacts on different sectors. The impact from compound dry and hot events is generally more severe than that from individual dry or hot event. Understanding the physical mechanism of this compound event is thus of particular importance for early warning to reduce potential impacts. In this study, we quantitatively assessed the relationship between the occurrence of compound dry and hot events and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the warm season at the global scale. Monthly precipitation and temperature from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) were used to estimate the occurrence of compound events, and Nino 3.4 index (NINO34) was used to represent the ENSO phenomenon. The logistic regression model was employed to model the occurrence of compound events with respect to NINO34. Results from the logistic regression model showed that ENSO played an important role in the occurrence of compound dry and hot events during the warm season in regions such as northern part of South America, southern Africa, southeastern Asia and Australia. A higher likelihood of the occurrence of compound dry and hot events in these regions was shown to be associated with higher values of NINO34 based on empirical analysis from observations. Results from this study will help improve our understanding of compound dry and hot events and aid with mitigation efforts for ameliorating their adverse impacts.

AB Medium-low temperature geothermal resources are abundant in Southern China, but their heat source and link to fault zones is poorly understood. Consequently, geothermal energy is only used at small scale. In order to broaden the footprint of geothermal energy use in Southern China, it is first necessary to understand and track the geothermal groundwater circulation pattern associated with fault zones. The Heyuan Fault Zone serves as a typical medium-low temperature geothermal system of South China. Here we show that the geothermal groundwater circulation pattern can be traced by using stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, helium and neon isotopes, carbon-13 and carbon-14 as well as hydrochemical parameters. The results show that: in the Heyuan Fault Zone, the main hydrochemical type of the hot springs is HCO3-Na + K, while the shallow cold groundwater is mainly enriched in HCO3-Ca. The results of the helium isotope and neon isotope indicate that the geothermal groundwater of this area is derived from the crust, thus excluding the possibility of extremely deep paths of groundwater tapping into mantle helium sources. Furthermore, the characteristics of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes imply that geothermal groundwater is of local meteoric origin, and the recharge area located at the hilly area of the hanging wall of the Heyuan main fault, with the recharge elevations ranging from about 440 m to 670 m. The hot spring geothermometer shows that the highest reservoir temperature is about 157 degrees C, and the deepest circulation depth is about 6500 m. Carbon-14 isotope age dating suggests that the geothermal groundwater ages are mostly from 9.9 kyr BP to 12.3 kyr BP. According to the geological structural characteristics of the study area, the main upward channel for geothermal groundwater is the Heyuan main fault. Generally, the hot springs in this area are mixed with shallow cold groundwater and surface water, which raises the ratio of the Ca2+ in water and dilutes the heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes.

AB Intertidal environments, including bare mudflats, tidal creeks, and vegetated salt marshes, are of significant physical and ecological importance in estuaries. Their morphodynamics are closely linked by mudflats and creek networks. Understanding water motion and sediment transport in mudflats and tidal creeks is fundamental to understand intertidal morphodynamics in intertidal environments. To explore dynamic interactions between tidal creeks and mudflats, we conducted field campaigns monitoring water depths, tidal currents, waves, suspended sediments, and bed-level changes at sites in both mudflats and tidal creeks in the Eastern Chongming tidal wetland in the Yangtze Delta for a full spring-neap tidal cycle. We saw that under fair weather conditions, the bed-level changes of the tidal creek site displayed a contrary trend compared with those of the mudflat site, indicating the source-sink relationship between tidal creek and mudflat. During over-marsh tides, the tidal creek site with relatively high bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.37 N/m(2)) was eroded by 35 mm whereas the mudflat site was accreted by 29 mm under low bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.18 N/m(2)). To the contrast, during creek-restricted tides, deposition occurred in the tidal creek site by 20 mm under low bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.09 N/m(2)) whereas erosion occurred in the mudflat site by 25 mm under relatively high bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.21 N/m(2)). Over a spring-neap tidal cycle, the net bed level changes were -15 mm (erosion) and 4 mm (deposition) in tidal creeks and mudflats, respectively. These results suggested that there were alternated erosion-deposition patterns in spring and neap tides, and a sediment source and sink shift between mudflats and creeks. We found that the eroded sediments in mudflats were transported landward into tidal creeks and deposited therein in neap tides, and these newly deposited sediments would be resuspended and transported to surrounding marshes (over-marsh deposition) at spring tides. The coherent sediment transport and associated erosion-deposition pattern within the mudflat-creek system at spring-neap tidal time scales thus played a fundamental role in intertidal morphodynamic development. These findings suggest that management and restoration of intertidal ecosystem need to take the entire mudflat-creek-marsh system as a unit into consideration rather than focusing on single elements.

AB Diurnal heat signal has been widely used to infer the seepage flux and thermal diffusivity in streambeds. The theoretical basis is the one-dimensional (1 - D) analytical solution of heat advection-dispersion equation with sinusoidal boundary condition and homogeneous initial condition (Stallman, 1965). However, the assumption of homogeneous initial condition made in Stallman (1965) is physically unrealistic and the assumption of steady flow is often violated when water level changes rapidly (e.g., flooding). To incorporate the realistic initial condition, an innovative solution for 1- D heat transport with sinusoidal boundary condition and arbitrary initial condition is proposed. This solution makes it possible to accurately simulate heat transport with transient flux by sequentially applying the new solution at small time interval. Synthetic temperature signals at different depth of streambeds are generated to study the impact of transient flux to the estimation of water flux and thermal diffusivity. Here are some major findings. Firstly, the calculated flux is sensitive to the flux dynamics. The faster the flux increases or decreases, the less accurate the calculated flux is. Secondly, using temperature time series from deep sensor pair is more likely to cause erroneous estimation of flux because heat signal damps fast with depth. Thirdly, the heat tracer method for estimating water flux is sensitive to the thermal properties of saturated sediments. Large thermal diffusivity leads to high uncertainty for flux estimation.

AB Identification of subregions that share similar historical drought variability provides useful information for drought monitoring, mitigation planning, and resource allocation. This study examined space-time historical drought variability for the Great Plains spanning from 1901 to 2015 by using rotated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (rEOFs). The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) on a three-month timescale was utilized to examine spatial and temporal changes in agricultural drought. We propose a new procedure for identifying the number of rEOFs to be selected for reconstructing subregions. Drought event intensities of moderate, severe, and extreme categories increased in recent years although the number of drought events decreased. Seasonal rEOFs demonstrated that 9-12 subregions were adequate to explain a significant proportion of the original variability in the Great Plains. The time series for each subregion was highly correlated to the original SPEI data and reflected the seasonal meteorological processes that drive drought variability. Several significant wetting trends were found, and there was statistical evidence that drought and wetting event severities had increased for a few subregions. Summer drought has become more variable across space and time, indicating that a more diverse set of resources and strategies might be needed to mitigate impacts of spatially-variable drought and wetting events in coming decades. Winter season drought has become less variable, indicating that perhaps resources could be consolidated when dealing with impacts on a larger scale; however, less variability implies that drought and wetting events may occur across larger regions of the Great Plains during a given season.

AB The hydrological alterations induced by dam construction modify natural flora and fauna habitats and impair ecosystem stability. Although many studies have documented the impacts of large dams on streamflow, few have described the effects of small dam construction on hydrological conditions. The cumulative effects of intensive small dams may also cause severe ecological problems. To evaluate the impacts of dam construction on the indicators of hydrological alterations, a framework that combined a hydrological model and the post bias correction method was proposed. The hydrological alterations of two individual rivers in the Jiulong River basin that experienced impacts from intensifying small hydropower reservoirs, the North River and the West River, were analyzed using the proposed framework. The results show that the framework can successfully avoid misleading the impacts of dam construction on monthly runoff and multi-minimum values detected by the previously common method that did not separate the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime. The small hydropower-dominated North River and the flood-control-dominated West River exhibited generally consistent change patterns of unchanging monthly river discharge, reduced high pulse count, reduced rise and fall rates, and increased number of reversals. Conversely, the changes to several Indicators of Hydrologic Alterations (IHA) differed between the two rivers. The flood-control-dominated West River exhibited 1) increased indicators, such as the base flow index, multi-day minimum flow and high pulse duration and 2) decreased multi-day maximum flow and low pulse count. Unlike the West River, the hydropower-dominated North River experienced 1) increased low pulse count and 2) decreased indicators such as multi-day minimum flow and low pulse duration. Our results implied that the ecological impacts of the small hydropower-dominated North River may exceed those of the flood-control-dominated West River. Therefore, the minimum ecological water demand should be considered not only in the large reservoirs operation, but also in the operation of small hydropower reservoirs.

AB Using monthly streamflow data from 9 gauging stations covering a period of 1960-2014 across the Huai River basin, China, the Pettitt method and GAMLSS model were used to quantify flood frequency and related implications for flood hazards. Results indicated that: (1) no significant change points were observed in flood flows at the Huangchuan, Hengpaitou and Bengbu stations. However, significant hydrological alterations were detected for flood flows at other 6 stations with change points during similar to 2000; (2) flood flows at the Bantai, Jiangjiaji and Hengpaitou stations were nonstationary but stationary flood flows were detected at other 6 stations. The Weibull distribution was the appropriate probability distribution describing flood flows across the Huai River basin and the lognormal distribution is the second best distribution; (3) no significant difference was detected for 10- and 20-year flood frequencies using the Pearson III type distribution function under the stationarity assumption. However, significant and increasing differences were expected for 30-, 50- and 100-year floods. It can be concluded that the assumption of stationarity, if the flood flows are actually nonstationary, can produce biased flood frequencies using Pearson III type distribution, and this result provides a critical reference for flood frequency analysis under the nonstationarity and/or stationarity assumption; (4) after 30 years, the flood magnification factor at Hengpaitou and Bengbu stations increased from 1 to 1.12 and from 1 to 1.06, respectively, implying higher flood risks at the Hengpaitou station. In addition, after 30 years, the return period of 100 year flood decreased from 100 years to less 70 years at the Hengpaitou station and from 100 years to nearly 78 years, implying higher frequency of floods with return periods of 100 years. Moreover, significant relations were detected between annual peak flood flow and flood-affected crop areas, implying that annual peak flood flow can be taken as an indicator of flood disasters across the Huai River basin and even in the Anhui province.

AB Bare soils and grasslands in arid and semi-arid conditions constitute a large portion of the earth surface. Evaporation, which is the main component of the water balance in these conditions, often takes place through a dry soil layer (DSL). There is no scientific agreement yet on the DSL effects on evaporation rates.
   The implementations of three conceptual models of DSL-evaporation were tested for the simulation of evaporation rates in a semi-arid study area in Central Spain: (i) the daily-average model, based on the assumption that the daily average vapour transport in a DSL can be represented in analogy to isothermal liquid flow; (ii) the numerical model solving the Richards equation, in this case HYDRUS1D was used; and (iii) the pore-scale model, based on soil column experiments in laboratory conditions. The evaporation rates estimated by the three conceptual models for semi-arid field conditions were compared with the evaporation rates measured by an eddy covariance tower in the same area.
   The results indicate that the daily-average conceptual model assumption, in which the DSL has no effects on evaporation, does not hold in very dry conditions. The numerical model solving the Richards equation was not able to simulate the effects of the DSL on evaporation rates. The evaporation estimates obtained by the pore-scale conceptual model were closest to the eddy covariance measurements during the dry season, however this model was applicable only to the relatively steady evaporation conditions during afternoons and only assuming spatially constant DSL thickness.

AB Quantifying the potential influence of climate change on future landslide hazard requires methodologies that allow to properly take into account nonstationarities in the hydro-meteorological causes.
   In this paper we provide a methodology for estimating return period of landslide triggering under climate change.
   The methodology capitalizes on the combined use of a stochastic rainfall generator and a hydrological and slope stability model. The stochastic rainfall generator takes into account the statistical dependency between rainfall event duration and intensity through copulas. The hydrological model is based on an analytical solution of a simplified version of the Richards vertical infiltration equation and slope stability is assessed by the infinite slope model. The combined model enables to estimate landslide probability through Monte Carlo simulations. Climate change is then introduced by perturbing the parameters of the rainfall stochastic generator based on factors of change derived from the comparison of future scenarios and the baseline climate as simulated by Regional climate models (RCMs). The Monte Carlo simulations are conducted sequentially on a future moving time window, to derive a yearly series of future landslide triggering probability. This series is then used to compute landslide return period by formulas suitable under nonstationary conditions.
   An application to the landslide prone region of the Peloritani Mountains, Southern Italy, is carried out to demonstrate the proposed approach. For the application, climate change projections of three RCMs of the MED-CORDEX initiative are used, and a preliminary assessment of the impacts of intermediate- and high-emission Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 is carried out.

AB The magnitude of floods depends not only on the intensity and pattern of precipitation during the flood event (the 'flood-producing' precipitation), but also on the moisture stored in the catchment, which arises from antecedent hydrological processes over many preceding timescales. To characterise this effect, an empirical study is conducted on the influence of antecedent precipitation on significant flood events across multiple climate zones and catchment conditions, using 100 Australian catchments with hourly streamflow and precipitation. Antecedent conditions are shown to have a significant influence on flood volume, with three quarters of catchments having at least a 50% difference in flood volume depending on whether the catchment is wet or dry before the flood-producing precipitation event. The study considers the sensitivity of flow to antecedent precipitation by means of an 'elasticity' metric, which indicates the proportional change in flow for a change in antecedent precipitation or flood-producing precipitation. Flood-producing precipitation nevertheless remains the dominant flood driver across most catchments, with the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation typically being between 28% and 37% of the elasticity to flood-producing precipitation. Importantly, the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation relative to flood-producing precipitation decreases with increasing event magnitude, highlighting that conclusions of future change based on annual maximum streamflow may not be reflective of the processes that operate for more extreme floods that have the greatest impact on society.

A stochastic sampling approach based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods was used to simulate samples from the posteriors, with a Metropolis within Gibbs sampler used for transfer functions and reaction rate coefficients. Non-negativity constraints were realized by choosing a reflected Gaussian prior for the transfer function and a lognormal prior for the reaction rate coefficient. The approach was tested by synthetic sparse datasets with introduced normal random errors or periodic errors, and then it was applied to the tracer test data collected at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The results indicate that the developed approach was well capable of characterizing anomalous transfer functions, such as multi-modal functions, and quantifying the uncertainty of both transfer functions and reaction rate coefficients. In particular, compared with the approach of individual inversion of sparse data, the joint inversion approach taking advantage of the sharing of information regarding transport processes across the conservative tracer and reactive tracer data leads to the improved estimation of transfer functions and reaction rate coefficients for sparse datasets.

AB We define model-data interaction (MDI) as a two way process between models and data, in which on one hand data can serve the modeling purpose by supporting model discrimination, parameter refinement, uncertainty analysis, etc., and on the other hand models provide a tool for data fusion, interpretation, interpolation, etc. MDI has many applications in the realm of groundwater and has been the topic of extensive research in the groundwater community for the past several decades. This has led to the development of a multitude of increasingly sophisticated methods. The progress of data acquisition technologies and the evolution of models are continuously changing the landscape of groundwater MDI, creating new challenges and opportunities that must be properly understood and addressed. This paper aims to review, analyze and classify research on MDI in groundwater applications, and discusses several related aspects including: (1) basic theoretical concepts and classification of methods, (2) sources of uncertainty and how they are commonly addressed, (3) specific characteristics of groundwater models and data that affect the choice of methods, (4) how models and data can interact to provide added value in groundwater applications, (5) software and codes for MDI, and (6) key issues that will likely form future research directions. The review shows that there are many tools and techniques for groundwater MDI, and this diversity is needed to support different MDI objectives, assumptions, model and data types and computational constraints. The study identifies eight categories of applications for MDI in the groundwater literature, and highlights the growing gap between MDI practices in the research community and those in consulting, industry and government.

AB Although rainfall characteristics play important roles in runoff generation and soil erosion, our understanding about how rainfall moving direction impacts surface flow and soil erosion on slopes considering spatial process of soil surface sealing is still poor. In this study, a series of laboratory experiments was conducted using a soil flume and a movable rainfall simulator to investigate this impact. Two rainfall moving directions (i.e. upslope-moving and downslope-moving) and two soil surface moisture conditions (i.e. dry runs with no antecedent rainfall and wet runs with antecedent rainfall) were considered in the experiments with different slope gradients and rainfall intensities. The results showed that the upslope-moving rainfalls generated more surface flow from 25% to 700% and less soil erosion than the downslope-moving rainfalls in the dry runs due to the different spatial developing processes of soil surface sealing. The difference between the runoff coefficients of the two moving direction rainfalls decreased remarkably (more than 50%) with slope gradient increasing from 15 degrees to 25 degrees. In the wet runs, surface flow was similar for the upslope-moving and downslope-moving rainfalls, as all of the soil surface had been sealed before the experiments. Soil erosion in the downslope-moving rainfalls was larger than that in the upslope-moving rainfalls due to higher sediment transport capability of the surface flow. For both rainfall moving directions with same rainfall conditions, the total soil erosion in a dry run was mostly larger than that in a wet run because of less erodible soil particles on the sealed slope in the wet run. The result of this study implied that different rainfall moving directions can lead to distinct spatial processes of soil surface sealing and caused large differences in surface flow and soil erosion processes on slopes.

AB Projected droughts for 21st century over India have been analysed using precipitation and temperature data obtained from Regional Climate Models (RCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized effective Precipitation Evapo-Transpiration Index (SP*ETI) and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at the timescale of 12-months have been used for drought characterization. The K-means clustering algorithm has been utilized to delineate distinct drought homogeneous regions in India. Trends and periodicities in drought characteristics have also been analysed. The results of this study reveal that increase in evapotranspiration due to projected rise in temperature would play a major role in affecting future drought dynamics in most parts of India. Analysis indicates that computed magnitude of drought intensity, duration and frequency depends on the choice of drought indicator. SPEI drought index has been found to project highest drought risk as compared to other two indices used in this study. North India is more vulnerable to increase in drought severity and frequency in near future. However in far future, most parts of the country, except few southeastern states, are likely to face an escalation in drought severity and frequency. A shift in drought hazard from central India toward southeast-central India is likely to happen with increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration. The areal extent of droughts has been found to be increasing historically which is expected to increase further in future for most parts of the country. Historically, drought dynamics were more influenced by decrease in precipitation. However, in future, the drought dynamics will be significantly influenced by increased evapotranspiration resulting from increase in temperature in spite of likely increase in precipitation. The periodicity analysis indicates inter-annual periodicities influencing monsoon months to be distributed uniformly across all clusters of the Indian subcontinent with dominant cycles of 2-3.6 years. Further, change in periodic cycles of drought due to climate change is found to be insignificant.

AB Numerous large river basins of the world have few and irregular observations of the components of the terrestrial hydrological cycle with the exception of stream gauges at a few locations and at the outlet along with sparsely distributed rain gauges. Using observations from satellite sensors and output from global land surface models, it is possible to study these under-observed river basins. With populations greater than a billion people, some of these rivers (e.g., the Ganga-Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, the Nile and the Mekong) are the economic engines of the countries they transect, yet thorough assessment of their flow dynamics and variability in regard to water resource management is still lacking. In this paper, we use soil moisture (0-2 m) and surface runoff from the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), evapotranspiration, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and total water storage anomaly from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to examine variability of individual water balance components. To this end, understanding the inter-annual and intra-seasonal variability and the spatial variability of the water balance components in the major river basins of the world will help to plan for improved management of water resources for the future.

AB Moving water can transport temperature signals of surface water into groundwater or vice-versa. We analyzed the temperature signals in the atmosphere, river, and pumped water to elucidate source water contributions to the pumping wells from the ambient groundwater and the river. Temperature fluctuations in response to high-frequency intermittent pumping were observed from February 2014 to August 2016 in 14 wells within three shallow unconfined alluvial aquifers along the Ohio River. The groundwater temperature observed in pumping wells displayed two alternating signals between pump-on and pump-off periods. The difference in groundwater temperatures between pump-on and pump-off periods was defined as a temperature shift. Temperature shifts indicate that pumping always introduces water of different temperature to the wells than that of the ambient groundwater. While seasonal pump-off temperatures varied up to 3.2 degrees C, the short-term temperature shifts ranged from 0.2 to 2.5 degrees C. Groundwater was generally warm in winter and cold in summer, but pumped water was of lower temperature in winter and higher in summer than the ambient groundwater. However, the pumping-induced temperature shifts were highest in summer and winter and lowest in spring and fall because groundwater temperature lagged that of surface water by approximately six months. The thermal transfer velocity in groundwater was more than one order magnitude higher during pumping than that during the recovery periods. High-frequency pumping changed produced-water temperature and increased the thermal transfer velocity in the groundwater. These results indicate that stream exfiltration is a major component of the water budget to a number of these wells. Thermal analysis reveals that the temperature of pumped water can trace source water to the pumping wells. This thermal approach for estimating the source of pumped water works best when groundwater temperature variation is seasonally large.

AB Flood processes in catchments are driven by a combination of rainfall and landscape characteristics. Upland peatlands are source areas of flooding but there is lack of understanding of how different rainfall intensities and temporal patterns may interact with land-cover configurations to influence flood peaks. Using spatially distributed (SD-) TOPMODEL we investigated these interactions for a case study peatland catchment. For each of four rainfall depths ranging from 20 mm to 50 mm, four storm rainfall patterns were applied (rainfall that was uniform, rainfall with an early peak intensity during the storm, middle peak and late peak). Late peak rainfall resulted in the highest river flow peaks at the catchment outlet studied, followed by middle and early rainfall peak patterns, while uniform rainfall through time gave the lowest flow peaks. A key factor was synchroneity of overland flow movement and concentration. The impact on river flow peaks of land-cover change on riparian zones and on gentle gradient slopes was larger than that for other parts of the catchment under different rainfall intensities and patterns. The impacts of land-cover change on proportional change in flood peaks in these sensitive areas became smaller when rainfall intensity increased, but absolute changes in flow peaks became larger. Land-cover change in sensitive areas under middle and late peak rainfall had a larger impact on river flow peaks than for early peak rainfall. It was possible to identify the 'worst' rainfall patterns for a particular case of land-cover change which may be useful for practitioners to help manage expectations of flood response to nature-based solutions.

AB In order to better define the characteristics of a karst conduit, an integrated hydrogeological study including numerical modeling using CFPv2 is conducted at a karst aquifer in the Zagros Mountain Region of Iran. The Sarvak limestone aquifer in the Nil Anticline is the main karst aquifer of the study area with major groundwater discharge taking place at Sarkur spring. An annual water balance and a dye tracing test confirmed that the karst system is mainly recharged through rainfall and the Maroon River. Several depressions are observed along the banks of the river with a major one classified as a sinkhole used for dye injection. A groundwater flow model was developed based on the available hydrogeological information. A probable direct conduit flow path with an estimated groundwater flow velocity of 96 m/h is estimated between the injection point and the Sarkur spring. Four scenarios are assumed to simulate the probable conduit flow path using the CFPv2 code. As one of the first attempts in regional groundwater flow modeling of a karst aquifer, CFPv2 is automatically calibrated with field measurements of spring discharge and a dye breakthrough curve through a parameter estimation code OSTRICH to optimize the characteristics of the conduit through the minimization of the weighted sum of square error. Simulated results reveal that a conduit with a diameter of 2.9 m is required to adequately simulate spring discharge and dye tracer migration between the injection and discharge points. Our new approach (linking of CFPv2 and OSTRICH) provides a deeper understanding of groundwater flow and solute transport in karst terrains even when available data are limited and the approach should be applicable to other areas.

AB The climate change and human activities can principally doubt the frequency analysis methods which assume that the hydrological events are stationary. The Pearson type 3 (P3) distribution, which has been widely applied in frequency analysis under the stationary condition, was developed for the nonstationary cases. The distribution parameters can be expressed as exponential or polynomial functions with time or other covariates. Parameter estimation for the nonstationary P3 model was done with the penalized maximum likelihood estimation (PMLE) method in which we applied a restrictive penalty on the location parameter to avoid unreasonable results. The results of the nonstationary P3 model were compared to that of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, in which the generalized maximum likelihood estimation (GMLE) method was applied to estimate the parameters. The Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the nonstationary P3 model provided better results than the nonstationary GEV model for different sample sizes. Both models were also applied in hydrological series with various trends and record lengths to prove the feasibility of the nonstationary P3 model in practical applications. The applications showed that the nonstationary P3 model performed better than the nonstationary GEV model in most of the studied cases.

AB Macropore flow is a ubiquitous hydrologic process that has not been well explained using traditional hydrologic theories. In particular, macropore flow velocity (MFV) is poorly understood with respect to its typical ranges and controlling factors. Here we conducted a meta-analysis based on an MFV dataset compiled from 243 measurements documented in 76 journal articles. The dataset includes MFV values measured using different approaches across the soil-core, field-profile, and trench scales. Our analyses show that MFV has a geometric mean of 1.08 x 10(-3) m s(-1), which is about 2 similar to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding values of saturated hydraulic conductivity in the soil matrix. Using machine learning methods including classification and regression tree and random forests algorithms, we identified observation scale, travel distance, rainfall intensity and macropore diameter as the most important factors that control MFV. MFV is much larger at the trench scale than at the other two scales mainly due to abundant large macropores. Correlation analysis and multivariate regression revealed that (1) MFV and rainfall intensity have significant positive correlation, which indicates that MFV is a dynamic variable; and (2) MFV and macropore diameter also have strong positive correlation at the trench scale, which indicates macropore size as a key controlling factor. Using macropore diameter and rainfall intensity as explanatory factors, MFV can be well predicted (R-2 = 0.76) by a multivariate regression equation at trench-scale, implying that rainfall intensity can be considered a proxy for the filling degree of macropores. Furthermore, both the Poiseuille and Manning equations were found to overestimate the MFV values, suggesting a parameter representing the connectivity of the macropore network is needed for providing reasonable estimates of MFV using physically-based equations.

AB Wedge-shaped aquifers are usually formed where two linear boundaries intersect. These types of aquifers are commonly seen in river basins and alluvial fans, but have received much less attention in the hydrological sciences community. Fundamental understanding of the effects of lateral boundaries on the hydrodynamic process in such aquifers is quite poor, particularly for unconfined-fractured and leaky wedge-shaped aquifer systems, which will be the concern of this study. Solutions of flow to a well in an unconfined-fractured wedge-shaped two aquifer system are obtained using Laplace, Hankel and Fourier transforms. An infinitesimal radius pumping well partially penetrates the overlying unconfined aquifer. Both aquifer layers are homogeneous and anisotropic bounded by two intersecting linear lateral boundaries of constant-head or barrier types and the aquifer system is semi-infinite in radial direction. The time domain drawdowns are obtained via the Stehfest algorithm and Gaussian Quadrature. The inter-porosity flow in the underlying fracture aquifer, the instantaneous water table drainage, the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and the wedge angle are taken into account. Eliminating the inter-porosity flow in the underlying fractured aquifer, the presented solution reduces to a leaky wedge-shaped aquifer case. The influences of the underlying fractured aquifer hydraulic parameters on the overlying unconfined aquifer for different wedge angles and linear lateral boundaries types are explored using dimensionless drawdown and scaled sensitivity curves. The results of this study can be utilized to obtain hydraulic parameters of an alluvial and river basin unconfined-fractured wedge-shaped aquifer systems. The presented solution can also be used for water budget assessment of river basin aquifers.

AB This study investigates the efficiency of correcting radar rainfall estimates using a stochastic error model in the upper Iguacu river basin in Southern Brazil for improving streamflow simulations. The 2-Dimensional Satellite Rainfall Error Model (SREM2D) is adopted here and modified to account for topographic complexity, seasonality, and distance from the radar. SREM2D was used to correct the radar rainfall estimates and produce an ensemble of equally probable rainfall fields, that were then used to force a distributed hydrological model. Systematic and random errors in simulated streamflow were evaluated for a cascade of sub-basins of the Iguacu catchment, with drainage area ranging from 1,808 to 21,536 km(2)). Results showed an improvement in the statistical metrics when the SREM2D ensemble was used as input to the hydrological model in place of the radar rainfall estimates in most sub-basins. Specifically, SREM2D was able to remove the relative bias (up to 50%) in the radar rainfall dataset regardless of the basin dimension, whereas the random error was reduced more prominently in the larger basins (up to 100 m(3) s(-1)). An event scale evaluation was also performed for nine selected flood events in three sub-basins. SREM2D reduced the overestimation in the cumulative rainfall and streamflow volumes during these events.

AB For accurate flash flood forecasting and effective stormwater planning and management in urban areas, it is necessary to model not only the natural channel systems but also the large and complex networks of storm drains. In this work, we describe a modular storm drain model that can easily be coupled with existing gridded distributed hydrologic models for real-time flash flood forecasting, and stormwater planning and management for large urban areas ( > 100 km(2)). A salient feature of our approach is the use of the equivalent storm drain network (ESDN) which approximates the actual network on the same grid as that of the distributed hydrologic model, thereby rendering coupling simple and modular. In the integrated model, storm-drain flow occurs through the simplified network coarsened to the resolution of the distributed hydrologic model without full 1D-2D dynamics or very detailed man-made structures and features modeled. The integrated model is applied to a 144.6 km(2) area of five urban catchments in the Cities of Arlington and Grand Prairie in Texas, US. Comparisons at selected locations using kinematic-wave flow simulations show that the ESDN approximates the flow through the original network very well with attendant savings in computational amount and reduction in modeling complexities. The impact of the storm drain network is assessed via a combination of simulation experiments, sensitivity analysis and limited comparison with observed flow. It is shown that the storm drain network in highly urbanized catchments in the study area is very effective in reducing surface flow at most locations for about 30 min following onset of significant rainfall, that the existing stormwater infrastructure would lose effectiveness for approximately 30% of the study area with a 15% increase in imperviousness relative to the current conditions, and that significant uncertainties exist in partitioning of surface flow into storm drain and natural channel flows due to sensitivity to inlet flow modeling. With greatly reduced computing cost and modeling complexity, the proposed approach offers a practical solution for integrated stormwater modeling for large urban areas for a wide range of applications. The proposed approach cannot, however, resolve flow at sub-grid scales and hence is not appropriate for very detailed modeling for small areas.

AB The Mekong region, home to one of the world's great rivers - the Mekong - is also one of the world's most geostrategic regions, featuring seemingly conflicting interests among regional states including Viet Nam, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia and world powers such as China and the United States of America.
   For nearly a century, some of the riparian states have developed parts of the basin in their territories - to great benefits and harm - and recently the remaining late developing countries are catching up with water and related resources development plans to dam, withdraw and use the mighty Mekong to fund national progress and alleviate poverty.
   World leaders, academics, NGOs, media and even some government officials have warned that the current rush to development is not only bringing a sure death to a great previously untamed river, potentially displacing millions of people, and threatening livelihoods, but would also usher in an era of aggravated tensions and possibly even conflict. The Mekong River Commission (MRC), tasked to manage the river for the sake of the environment and the people, is failing its mission with work that has been ineffective, uninfluential and wasted, critics say.
   Yet this scenario is both wrong in its thesis about Mekong development and misleading in its understanding of MRC's role and work. While past and current water resources development in the region has brought challenges and risks associated with changes in the river system, these have not led to widespread destruction of livelihoods and conflict among riparian countries.
   A critical factor preventing conflict and managing tensions as well as supporting optimal and sustainable development is the MRC and its water diplomacy framework, which has a technical core to provide objective scientific advices and legal, institutional and strategic mechanisms that facilitate and support negotiated solutions to complex water and related problems. While challenges remain for the MRC as an organization, its water diplomacy framework has gradually been established and strengthened as the cases of managing tensions and potential conflicts in the Mekong for the past twenty years illustrate.

AB A hydrologic model, calibrated using only streamflow data, can produce acceptable streamflow simulation at the watershed outlet yet unrealistic representations of water balance across the landscape. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of multi-objective calibration using remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) and gaged streamflow data to spatially improve the water balance. However, methodological clarity on how to "best" integrate ET data and model parameters in multi-objective model calibration to improve simulations is lacking. To address these limitations, we assessed how a spatially explicit, distributed calibration approach that uses (1) remotely sensed ET data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and (2) frequently overlooked biophysical parameters can improve the overall predictability of two key components of the water balance: streamflow and ET at different locations throughout the watershed. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), previously modified to represent hydrologic transport and filling-spilling of landscape depressions, in a large watershed of the Prairie Pothole Region, United States. We employed a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments to isolate the effects (on streamflow and simulated ET) of integrating biophysical parameters and spatially explicit remotely sensed ET data into model calibration. Results suggest that the inclusion of biophysical parameters involving vegetation dynamics and energy utilization mechanisms tend to increase model accuracy. Furthermore, we found that using a lumped, versus a spatially explicit, approach for integrating ET into model calibration produces a sub-optimal model state with no potential improvement in model performance across large spatial scales. However, when we utilized the same MODIS ET datasets but calibrated each sub-basin in the spatially explicit approach, water yield prediction uncertainty decreased, including a distinct improvement in the temporal and spatial accuracy of simulated ET and streamflow. This further resulted in a more realistic simulation of vegetation growth when compared to MODIS Leaf-Area Index data. These findings afford critical insights into the efficient integration of remotely sensed "big data" into hydrologic modeling and associated watershed management decisions. Our approach can be generalized and potentially replicated using other hydrologic models and remotely sensed data resources - and in different geophysical settings of the globe.

AB The estimates of actual evapotranspiration (E) across basins and/or regions are still facing some difficulties because of the complex interactions amongst the components of the land-plant-atmosphere system, even though the basic physical mechanism of E is well understood. Presenting as a nonlinear relationship constrained by physical limits, the Budyko framework serves as a powerful tool used to estimate the averaged E at long-term scale. Given the ability of Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) in effectively simulating the terrestrial water storage change (Delta TWS) at monthly scale, a model to estimate E was developed based on the Budyko framework with mean monthly parameter of multi-years, and was applied to the estimation of E for the 24 selected catchments in different climatic regions across China. Results indicate that for the majority of 24 catchments, the positive or negative trends in precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (E-0), runoff (R) and Delta TWS were not statistically significant during 2003-2013 at both annual and monthly scales, but the Delta TWS occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of P into R and E at monthly scale. The monthly Budyko parameter showed large variation within the year and also across these 24 catchments. The Budyko-modeled monthly E (Budyko-E) represented the GRACE-derived ones (GRACE-E) across these catchments well with both modeled E volumes and hydrograph shapes which were also consistent with GRACE-E series except some underestimation for peak E. Overall, the Budyko-E represented GRACE-E in the arid and semi-arid catchments comparatively better than it in the humid and semi-humid catchments due to the larger proportion of Delta TWS in the P partition. Among all the 24 selected catchments, the monthly Budyko-type E model represented the GRACE-E across Shixiali catchment (located in the Hai River basin) best, with the correlation coefficient (r), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSCE) and relative error (RE) between GRACE-E and simulated results being 0.996, 0.988, - 0.033 in calibration and 0.994, 0.951, - 0.111 in validation, respectively. Furthermore, using GRACE-E as the benchmark values, the Budyko-E outperformed four other global E products from the newly published Global Land Data Assimilation System with Noah Land Surface Model-2 (GLDAS_E), MODIS (MODIS_E), Japanese 25-year reanalysis product (JRA_E), and Zhang's method (Zhang_E). GLDAS_E was the best of four global E products at reproducing monthly variations, with relatively high r and NSCE values, small RE. While MODIS_E showed the poorest performance in reproducing the inter-annual E variations of these catchments, which was reflected by low r and NSCE values. This extended Budyko-E model can apply in other similar climatic regions and also may provide skill in evaluating the water resources since the preferable accuracy of E estimate.

AB Global satellite precipitation products, such as Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and its successor, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), have provided hydrologists with a critical precipitation data source for hydrological applications in data-sparse or ungauged basins. This study conducts a comparative analysis on the quality of the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42V7 and the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final Run version 05 precipitation products and their hydrological utilities in the Yellow River source region (YRSR), a mountainous Alpine region in northwestern China, from April 2014 to December 2016. Results indicate that when evaluated against the ground precipitation observations, IMERG generally improves the daily precipitation estimates relative to its predecessor 3B42V7. In addition, and the correlation coefficients (CCs) of IMERG (0.328 and 0.527) are significantly higher at grid and basin scales than those of 3B42V7 (0.287 and 0.458). However, the 3-hourly precipitation estimates from both products poorly correlate with the ground observations at grid and basin scales. By using the grid-based Xinanjiang (GXAJ) hydrological model calibrated with the gauge-based precipitation for daily streamflow simulations, the 3B42V7-driven model run shows acceptable hydrological simulation skill with regard to the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE = 0.729), whereas IMERG demonstrates improved performance (NSE = 0.810), which is comparable with the gauge-based simulation (NSE = 0.807). Input-specific model recalibration effectively enhances the hydrological performance of both satellite products (NSE = 0.856 for IMERG and NSE = 0.840 for 3B42V7). Additionally, the gauge-benchmarked GXAJ model with 3B42V7 has limited hydrological skill in simulating three historical flood events at 3-hourly time intervals (NSE = - 0.070 to 0.702), while IMERG has a slightly better performance (NSE = 0.266-0.792). Model recalibration also significantly improves the simulations of two out of three flood events, and the NSE skill cores of IMERG (0.581-0.901) and 3B42V7 (-0.795 to 0.852) are relatively lower than that of the gauge-based simulation (0.753-0.969) but comparable. Overall, the IMERG and 3B43V7 satellite precipitation products can be adopted as reliable precipitation sources for hydrological simulations at daily and sub-daily time scales in the study area, with IMERG better suited than 3B42V7. Considering that the low CC values exist in both IMERG and 3B42V7 products, in particular, at a subdaily temporal scale, the GPM research community should further improve the calibration algorithms and enhance the quality of IMERG products in YRSR. Performing bias-correction of satellite precipitation products is also necessary for hydrological modelers to effectively improve their hydrological utilities.

AB In this paper, a novel Laplace-transform boundary element model for pumping tests in irregularly shaped double-porosity aquifers is presented. The aquifer could be associated with various boundary conditions, such as the general Robin boundary conditions or even the mixed boundary conditions with no-flow boundary on one side and constant head boundary on the other side. The derived solution has analytical characteristics since it is obtained through the Green's function method within the domain. Unlike traditional numerical methods, the proposed solution using the Laplace-transform boundary element method does not require discretization in spatial and temporal dimensions. In this study, boundary integral equation using Green's second theorem and the fundamental solution of Green function for dual-porosity models are given. A boundary element matrix in Laplace space is established, which allow us to consider irregularly shaped boundary. The drawdown and flux on the boundary can be obtained through solving the boundary element matrix by Gauss's elimination method. The final solution for wellbore drawdown is evaluated using numerical Laplace inversion algorithm of Stehfest (1970). Many previous solutions for transient flow in finite single-porosity aquifers with no-flow outer boundary condition are shown to be special cases of the present solution. Furthermore, the solution with a mixed outer boundary condition is used to investigate the effect of important parameters of aquifers on wellbore drawdown, including fracture storage coefficient, inter-porosity flow coefficient from matrix to fissures, boundary shape, boundary location, and interference of multiple wells.

AB Short term studies have found that stormwater biofiltration systems, also known as bioretention systems or raingardens, are very effective in reducing heavy metal concentrations. However, their long-term treatment performance, as well as the spatial and temporal accumulation of metals within these systems remain uncertain. This paper reports on a large scale field study that assessed the changes over time of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) levels in biofilters varying in age, design, and catchment characteristics. The survey incorporated 29 biofilters in 2006/7 and 49 biofilters, in 2014/15, located in three major Australian cities (Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney). Noting that these results are influenced by having just one industrial site with 25 filters measured at that site Catchment characteristics were significantly correlated with metal accumulation rates. Biofilters in catchments with current or past industrial activities had elevated heavy metal concentrations in the filter media. Zinc concentrations in the surface 0-100 mm exceed both soil quality and ecological guidelines. In contrast, heavy metal concentrations in residential catchments are unlikely to (ever) reach levels that exceed soil quality guidelines for human health, although zinc concentrations approach ecological guideline criteria.

AB The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) algorithm very well captures the spatio-temporal Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) variability, which is relevant to compute Crop Water Requirement (CWR) of commercial farms during the dry season. Considering this, a study was conducted in the arid and semi-arid parts of middle Awash in Ethiopia using reflectance and radiance satellite datasets of both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat's Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The SEBS model e derived AET was compared with the CWR computed from ground (observed) meteorological datasets. The results revealed that the amount of AET over the study area was dependent on temperature, surface radiative property, moisture content and crop development stage. The AET derived from satellite datasets was strongly related to the ground computed CWR over the irrigated sugarcane and cotton fields. The study revealed that the technique could be of great help during irrigation management, water conservation and allocation. Hence, we recommend decision makers of the commercial farms to further explore the use of this technique to properly manage and schedule their irrigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While the application of neural networks for groundwater level forecasting in general has been investigated by many authors, the use of nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs (NARX) is relatively new. For this work NARX were applied to obtain groundwater level forecasts for several wells in southwest Germany. Wells in porous, fractured and karst aquifers were investigated and forecasts of lead times up to half a year were conducted for both influenced (e.g. nearby pumping) and uninfluenced wells. Precipitation and temperature were chosen as predictors, which makes the selected approach easily transferable, since both parameters are widely available and simple to measure. Input and feedback delays were determined by applying STL time series decomposition on the data and using autoand cross-correlation functions on the remainders to determine significant time lags. Coefficient of determination, (relative) root mean squared error and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency were used to evaluate forecasts, the model selection was based on an out-of-sample validation on rolling basis. The results are promising and indicate an outstanding suitability of NARX for groundwater level predictions with such a small set of inputs in all three aquifer types. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been widely applied to assimilate dynamic data such as hydraulic head in geologic models for improved predictions over the past decade. It has various advantages such as the capability of handling multiple sources of uncertainty and ease of coupling with forward simulators involving complex physics; however, it is not reliable for updating models that are characterized by curvilinear structures such as in fluvial deposits where high-permeability conduits play a dominant role for solute transport. Several methods have been proposed to handle non-Gaussian aspects in the EnKF. For instance, the EnKF has been coupled with the normal-score transform (NS-EnKF) for data assimilation in non-multi-Gaussian distributed conductivity fields, and this approach has been applied in a number of studies. As an alternative to the EnKF, the iterative ensemble smoother (ES) has been proposed for data assimilation, where all the data at all time steps are integrated into geologic models together, instead of the sequential data integration of the EnKF. The ES therefore has much less computational cost than the EnKF. This work coupled the normal-score transform and ensemble smoother (NS-ES) for data assimilation in non-multi-Gaussian distributed conductivity fields. The algorithm is compared to the NS-EnKF and evaluated in a synthetic bimodal aquifer. The results show that (1) the NS-ES is able to reproduce the curvilinear structures of the reference field, and the performance of updated models using the NSES is improved in terms of flow and transport predictions; and (2) the NS-ES can obtain results comparable to the NS-EnKF for characterization of non-multi-Gaussian conductivities, and has the advantage of less computational cost.

AB It remains a challenge to obtain an accurate middle and long-term runoff forecast, especially in flood seasons. The forecast performance can be improved using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to produce cleaner signals as model inputs. In many EEMD based forecast models, the entire time series are decomposed into several sub-series, and each sub-series is divided into calibration and validation datasets and forecasted by some common models, such as artificial neural network (ANN), and finally an ensemble forecast is obtained by summing the forecasted results of each sub-series. In such a decomposition-ensemble framework, some future information is used, and thus it is a hindcast experiment. Attempts have also been made to propose a real forecast experiment, which, however, often cannot be able to adapt to the non-stationary changes in runoff due to the lack of adaptive ability. Therefore, this study tries to improve the decomposition-ensemble framework and propose an adaptive middle and long-term runoff forecast model especially for flood seasons. Unlike a hindcast experiment, it does not use any future information; and unlike conventional forecast experiments, its decomposition and forecast models are adjusted adaptively as long as new runoff information is added. EEMD is used to decompose the original time series and ANN is used to forecast each sub-series, hence the name an adaptive EEMD-ANN (AEEMD-ANN) model. This model is applied to forecast the 1-month ahead streamfiow of three stations in China, and the results show that the AEEMD-ANN model can improve forecast accuracy in flood seasons, but it is not as good as ANN, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) and seasonal first-order autoregressive (SAR (1)) models in dry seasons. While the conventional forecast models, especially the SAR (1) models, are more suitable in dry season. Therefore, it is recommended to use SAR (1) model in dry season and AEEMD-ANN model in flood season to forecast the monthly runoff in Yangtze River Basin. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes an integrated (hybrid) Artificial Neural Network-Bayesian (ANN-B) modelling approach to improve the accuracy of predicting seasonal water allocation prices in Australia's Murry Irrigation Area, which is part of one of the world's largest interconnected water markets. Three models (basic, intermediate and full), accommodating different levels of data availability, were considered. Data were analyzed using both ANN and hybrid ANN-B approaches. Using the ANN-B modelling approach, which can simulate complex and non-linear processes, water allocation prices were predicted with a high degree of accuracy (R-BASIC = 0.93, R-INTER. = 0.96 and R-FULL = 0.99); this was a higher level of accuracy than realized using ANN. This approach can potentially be integrated with online data systems to predict water allocation prices, enable better water allocation trade decisions, and improve the productivity and profitability of irrigated agriculture.

AB Sewer overflow is a priority concern for many cities. Owing to the high density of buildings and populations, constructing new storage tanks in urban areas is getting more and more difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Inter Catchment Wastewater Transfer (ICWT) method for sewer overflow mitigation. The ICWT method aims at redistributing the spatial mismatched sewer flow according to the treatment capacity of Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Three tasks are involved in the development of ICWT. First, test the effectiveness of ICWT. Second, study how to properly redistribute inflow to the WWTP. Third, the operation of ICWT highly depends on inflow to the WWTP, to support the management of ICWT, it is imperative to construct a flow rate prediction model. A hydraulic model is used for task 1 and 2, individual and combined effects of the storage tank and ICWT on sewer overflow are investigated. The simulation results show that less overflow is obtained. In considering the deficiencies of hydraulic model, one of the most promising deep learning techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is employed to undertake task 3. Experiments demonstrated that LSTM could be of great use in predicting sewer flow. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change will modify the availability of groundwater resources in the future. Thus the evaluation of average aquifer recharge from precipitation, and its uncertainty, becomes a key subject in determining suitable countrywide water policies. The confident prediction of renewable groundwater resources requires an accurate evaluation of aquifer recharge over time and space, especially in large territories with varied conditions for aquifer recharge such as continental Spain. This study asses impacts of future potential climatic change scenarios on distributed net aquifer recharge (NAR) from precipitation over continental Spain. For this, the used method (1) generates future time series of climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) spatially distributed over the territory for potential aquifer recharge (PAR), and (2) simulates them within previously calibrated spatial PAR or NAR recharge models from the available historical information to provide distributed PAR or NAR time series. The information employed comes from the Spain02 project for the historical climatic data, from Alcala and Custodio (2014, 2015) for the historical spatial NAR, and from the CORDEX EU project (2013) regional climate models (RCMs) simulations for the future climate scenarios. A distributed empirical precipitation-recharge model is defined by using a regular 10 km x 10 km grid, and assuming that precipitation (P) and temperature (T) are the most important climatic variables determining PAR, while their spatiotemporal variabilities determine the impacts of future potential climatic scenarios on renewable groundwater resources. Potential plausible pictures of future climate scenarios are defined by combining information coming from different RCMs and General Circulation models (GCMs), downscaling techniques, and ensemble hypothesis. These scenarios were simulated within the used precipitation-recharge model to estimate impacts on NAR. The results show that global mean NAR decreases by 12% on average over continental Spain. Over 99.8% of the territory, a variable degree of recharge reduction is obtained; the reduction is quite heterogeneously distributed in line with the variety of conditions for aquifer recharge over continental Spain. The standard deviation of annual mean NAR will increase by 8% on average in the future. The dependence of these changes regarding potential explanatory variables, such as elevation and latitude was also analysed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A framework to derive high-resolution long-term meteorological forcing for hydrologic models from mesoscale atmospheric reanalysis products is presented, including topographic and cloud corrections, and a new physical parameterization of near-surface wind fields. The methodology is applied to downscale 3-hourly North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) fields originally at 32 km spacing to 1 km and hourly resolution for a seven-year period (2007-2013) over the Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment 2014 (IPHEx2014) domain with the focus on the Southern Appalachian Mountains (SAM) in the SE US. Evaluation of the adjusted downscaled products was conducted against flux tower observations in the IPHEx domain. At high elevations, the Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) of atmospheric pressure decreased from 44.71 to 2.78 hPa, and the RMSEs of near-surface temperature improved by 1 K (up to 5 K in winter). In addition, RMSEs decreased by as much as 100% for near-surface winds (10 m above ground) at all tower locations and by 25-30 W/m(2) for shortwave radiation at low elevations. Using the uncalibrated Duke Coupled surface-groundwater Hydrology Model (DCHM), the value and utility of the downscaled products for hydrologic offline simulations are demonstrated through comparative analysis of the sensitivity of water and energy budgets in mountain watersheds for four water-years (2007/10-2011/09) including a severe drought and several flood events. Cloud and topographic corrections applied to incoming solar radiation result in hourly net radiation changes ranging from 200 to 500 Wm(-2) at mid-day for clear-sky and cloudy conditions, respectively. Improvements in shortwave radiation and near-surface wind speed estimates have the highest impact on evapotranspiration and soil surface temperature. Wind speed differences of 2-10 m/s translate into basin-averaged differences mid-day surface fluxes up to 300 Wm(-2) and 100 Wm(-2) in the inner SAM, for sensible and latent heat respectively.

AB We report hereby the results of our study on optical damage threshold of DNA and DNA-CTMA thin films, doped with natural chromophores extracts. The films were obtained by spin coating on glass substrates. Their morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Their optical damage threshold, which is an important parameter determining practical application of materials in photonics, was studied using a Q switched Nd:YAG laser, operating at 1064.2 sun with 6 ns pulse duration. The study shows that the doping extracts increase significantly this parameter. In some cases it depends also on the method used to obtain the thin film solutions.

AB Sb2Te3 thin films are very promising candidates for nonlinear optics and several applications including super-resolution and nano-photoinscription. This work aims to offer a detailed study of the preparation of the thin films and their nonlinear optical properties under nanosecond laser excitation. Thin Sb2Te3 films have been deposited by the electron beam deposition technique. The films have been protected by a thin silica layer, then annealed in order to enhance their nonlinearities by material crystallization. The annealing has been optimized by simultaneously recording the X-Ray diffraction diagrams. After this optimization, the annealing could be safely performed by heating in an oven. The nonlinear optical properties of the Sb2Te3 thin films have been studied by means of the Z-scan technique employing 11 ns laser pulses at 1064 nm and 532 nm. High nonlinear absorption has been found showing the possibility to employ these materials for super-resolution, mode-locking and other applications.

AB The effects of different post-growth treatments on the structural and optical properties of ZnO microrods are presented. Hexagonal ZnO microrods are initially synthesized by hydrothermal growth method and then coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and/or annealed in ambient air. The as-prepared and annealed microrods exhibit distinct hexagonal facets while the microrods subjected to PVP coating and to PVP coating with subsequent annealing have pitted surfaces. Moreover, the ZnO microrods with post-growth treatments have reduced and nearly suppressed visible emissions compared with the as-prepared microrods. The different post-growth treatments affect the morphology and photoluminescence properties but the average dimensions and crystallinity of the ZnO microrods are retained. Regardless of post-growth treatment, the ZnO microrods have intense and very fast UV emission with an average lifetime of less than 30 ps and therefore exhibit potential for UV phosphor applications.

AB A proposed boron nitride/graphene oxide (BN/GO) composite photodetector (PD) was prepared using a drop cast method for photodetection in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light ranges. Morphology of the GO, distribution of BN nanoparticles and composition of B, N, C and O elements were confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) analysis and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy results. Raman scattering indicates high frequency intrinsic E(2)g vibrations at 1349 cm(-1) and low intense peaks at 803 cm(-1) from hexagonal BN (h-BN) structures in the bulk GO layer, while an overlap in the D and G bands at 1349 and 1581 cm(-1) respectively indicates the presence of the GO layer. Excellent photoconduction of 380 and 405 nm UV sources and a 650 nm red laser source showed that the measured photocurrent is dependent on power regardless of the signal wavelength. Variations in sensitivity allow the device to be operated at selected direct current (DC) bias voltages, while high frequency modulation at 1000 Hz showed a profound rise and fall time about 13.6 and 245.6 mu s respectively. Characteristics as self-powered PD was observed, has an enhancement about 3450% at its zero bias voltage.

AB In this paper, a new Selenium (Se) solar cell design based on inserting dissimilar ultrathin metallic layers (MLs), (Au and Ti), is proposed. Analytical models of the proposed design are developed, where the analytical results are in agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the role of the introduced ultrathin MLs in enhancing the light-scattering in the Se solar cell structure is also demonstrated. Moreover, the impact of the Mg mole fraction of the ZnMgO buffer layer on the device performance is investigated. It is revealed that the proposed structure give rise to optical micro-cavity effects which leads to improve the absorbance and reduce the reflection. Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique is used to boost up the solar cell efficiency by selecting both the appropriate position of the ultrathin Ms and the suitable Mg mole fraction of the ZnMgO layer. It is concluded that the optimized design with Ti MLs pinpoint a new path toward achieving superior power efficiency of 13.2%, where improved I-sc of 21 mA/cm(2) and enhanced V-oc of 1 V are recorded. Moreover, the impact of the metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) introduced in the ZnMgO buffer layer on the device performance is also investigated, where an improved power efficiency value of 14.7% is recorded. This makes the optimized designs potential alternative top cells for developing high-efficiency tandem photovoltaic devices at a reasonable cost.

The compounds were then characterized by using IR, H-1 and C-13 NMR and UV-Vis methods. The dichloro anthracene chalcone isomers have been solved and refined using X-ray single crystal diffraction data and optimized at the ground state using density functional theory (DFT) method with B3LYP/6-311G+ + (d,p) level. The experimental spectroscopic data were compared with the calculated TD-DFT spectra, where the values are in good agreement. The most stable conformer of the chalcones is identified from the computational results. Both compounds also show a good HOMO-LUMO energy gap values of 2.96 and 3.14 eV. The dipole moment at the different ortho-para and ortho-ortho position are 2.71D and 4.58D, respectively. The difference in orientation of the ortho-para and ortho- ortho position results affect the dipole moments and NLO properties response of the compounds. The analyses of nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were performed by calculating the third-order nonlinear polarizabilities. Both compounds show reasonably good NLO responds with the magnitude and sign of the third order optical susceptibility was determined. Based on the measured nonlinear susceptibility X-3 both structures offers great potential in applications such as optical switching and other optoelectronics devices.

Carrier transportation is studied by temperature-dependent electroluminescence (TDEL). With n-doping in the SLs and BQWs, the major emission peak is from the GQWs. Under low temperature and high injection current, side peaks emitted form SLs and BQWs can be observed. Reducing the number of GQWs will result in stronger side peaks. We propose that the disequilibrium in carrier concentration bring high drift velocity to the holes, partial holes fly across the sidewall of V-pits to n-side and recombined with the electrons in the BQWs and SLs.

AB As a novel photomechanical behavior, structural changes of azobenzene-based photochromic amorphous molecular films fabricated on the surface of soft materials such as agar gel were found upon irradiation with linearly polarized laser beam. The present photomechanical behavior included two-stage processes, striped pattern formation in the direction perpendicular to the polarization direction of the incident beam and subsequent band-like structure formation aligned in the direction parallel to the polarization direction. Both glass-transition temperature of the photochromic materials and the viscosity of the underlying layers were suggested to be important factors for exhibiting the present photomechanical behavior.

AB Thermo/pH dual-responsive luminescent composites consisting of lanthanide-polyoxometalates and Poly (Nisopropylacrylamide)/Chitosan were synthesized. The dual-responsive nanoparticles are characterized by the FT-IR, UV-vis, TEM, SEM, TGA, DLS and luminescence. The prepared composites exhibit the thermo/pH-responsive properties and the controllable and switchable luminescence in solution in response to the simple changes in temperature and pH values. For instance, the composite hydrogels exhibit intense red luminescence under UV irradiation below 34 degrees C, and the luminescence become much weaker in solution above 34 degrees C. Moreover, the hydrogel could not show red luminescence in the buffer solution with low pH value. However, it shows bright red luminescence in neutral and alkaline buffer solution. The possible reasons for controllable luminescence are discussed in the research. The results suggest that the multifunctional nanoparticles could be potentially used in biomedical fields such as luminescent switches, biological labeling and imaging.

The resulting products possess few-layer thickness with an average size about 2.6 nm. Due to the strong quantum confinement effect, the obtained MoS2 QDs showed an enlarged band gap of 3.90 eV and a good photoluminescence property. Furthermore, this cost-effective and efficacious method may provide a potential advance for preparation of other layered material QDs.

AB A novel single-phase Eulytite-type orthophosphate Ba7Hf(PO4)(6):Dy3+ was prepared via sintering method. X-ray powder diffraction analysis confirmed the obtained samples were good single phase and no impure phase was found. The optical properties of Ba7Hf(PO4)(6):Dy3+ phosphors were characterized and the influence on the luminescent properties with various Dy3+ contents was studied clearly. Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra, decay times as well as the temperature quenching spectra of Ba7Hf(PO4)(6):Dy3+ phosphors were studied minutely. The experiment results illustrated the prepared Ba7Hf(FO4)(6):Dy3+ phosphor showed two photoluminescence bands centered at 485 nm and 578 nm which were attributed to F-4(9/2 )-> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) transitions of Dy3+ when pumped by UV. Meanwhile, an abnormal phenomenon was found that when the temperature increased, the emission intensity of Ba7Hf(PO4)(6):Dy3+ at 485 nm and 578 nm gradually decreased but the emission spectra at 451 nm assigned to I-4(15/2) -> H-6(15/2) increased sharply with increasing temperature. Hence, temperature dependent I-4(15/2 ->) H-6(15/2) transition was analyzed in detail by X-ray powder diffraction, emission spectra and decay curves at different temperature, which was rarely discussed before. We found that the electrons preferentially select energy level transition of Dy3+ in Ba7Hf(PO4)(6) through temperature control. All the results showed that Ba7Hf(PO4)(6):Dy3+ is a high-performance single-component phosphor.

AB ZnO is an n-type semiconductor having a wide band gap which has been studied as green phosphors because of its luminescence properties, although the centers and mechanisms responsible for its luminescence are still a matter of controversy. Band gap engineering of ZnO can be achieved by the incorporation of Mg atoms, resulting in the modification of the deep level emission in the visible region. In this study, nanostructured Zn1-xMgxO samples were prepared through the polymeric precursor method and their structural and photoluminescent properties were characterized. FE-SEM images reveal a polygonal morphology of ZnO nanoparticles and a uniform particle size ranging from 35 to for 91 nm depending on the annealing temperature. XRD results show that Zn1-xMgxO samples crystallized completely without the presence of secondary phases (up to 20 at. %) and the diffraction patterns correspond to the hexagonal wurtzite structure with P6(3)mc space. Theoretical and experimental XANES spectra at Zn K-edge along FTIR measurements suggest occurrence of O vacancies. These vacancies are related to the green emission of photoluminescence spectra for ZnO samples, which is centered at similar to 529 nm. As the Mg content increases, an enhancement of this emission is observed, which is associated with the recombination of electrons in Mg interstitials donor states and holes at Zn vacancies.

AB Photoluminescent carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) have attracted much attention over the past decade due to their unique optical characteristics and negligible toxicity. However, it is very difficult to obtain red emission of CNMs. Bright red fluorescent carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) were prepared by facilely adjusting the reaction temperature through a one-step solvothermal route, using p-phenylenediamine (PPD) as precursor. The assynthesized CPDs exhibit excitation-independent emission at about 608 nm under excitation from 365 to 550 nm. Loading CPDs in starch to form CPDs-starch powder, the resultant powder exhibits strong red emission and the typical aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching was effectively suppressed, thus allowing the CPDs to be used in solid state form. More importantly, latent fingerprints (LFPs) on surfaces of various substrates, including glass, stainless steel, marble, adhesive tape, aluminum foil, painted wood, compact disc (CD), and coin, are developed by CPDs-starch powder and exhibit clear patterns and satisfactory ridge details under a 365 nm UV lamp. Furthermore, fingerprints on surfaces with multicolored background and strong florescent properties could also be clearly observed. These results suggest that CPDs-starch powder can be used as a fluorescent labeling agent for the visualization of LFPs in forensic science.

AB Zinc borate glasses doped with 2.0 mol% of Er2O3 and mixed with thermally resistant transition metal oxides viz., Ta2O5, Nb2O5 and ZrO2 were synthesized. Optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra and decay profiles of these glasses were recorded at ambient temperature. The spectra were characterized using Judd-Ofelt theory and various radiative parameters viz., transition probability, A, branching ratio, beta, and the radiative lifetime, tau, of principal emission transitions of Er3+ ions in these glasses were evaluated. The results indicated a significant enhancement in the intensity of green emission (related to S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) transition) of Er3+ ions due to co-doping of the glass system with Ta2O5, Nb2O5 and ZrO2. Quantitative analysis of the results pointed out that ZrO2 is the most favorable oxide among the three co-dopants for achieving the highest quantum efficiency of green emission. Results were further analyzed based on the structural modifications taking place in the vicinity of Er3+ ions due to co-doping with Ta2O5, Nb2O5 and ZrO2 and the reasons for such improvement were identified by means of IR and Raman spectroscopy studies. Additionally, the S-4(3/2) energy level of Er3+ ions (from which the green emission is originated) seemed to be additionally populated by the energy transfer from the excited state of ZnO and contributed to the amplification of green emission.

AB Ga2S3 single crystals were studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. XRD pattern of the sample is well-matched with reported hexagonal structure of beta-Ga2S3 . The spectra of real and imaginary parts of complex dielectric function (epsilon = epsilon(1) + epsilon(2)) and refractive index (N = n + ik) were plotted in the 1.2-6.2 eV range according to results of ellipsometric data. The e 2 -spectrum and analyses of absorption coefficient pointed out that studied sample has band gap energy of 2.48 eV which is consistent with that of beta-Ga(2)S(3)2.

AB For a long time, obtaining the optical and morphological properties of a transparent sample with high accuracy without degrading the layer has been challenging. To achieve these expectations, contactless techniques are used and have not only been proven well-suitable but have also brought optical methods to the forefront. Over recent years white light scanning interferometry has been increasingly used for studying and characterizing transparent materials with thicknesses ranging from a few hundred nanometers to several micrometers. Then, multiple techniques have been developed to retrieve the transparent layer properties from interferometric data. The more recent techniques, based on the use of an error function which defines the best fit between the experimental and theoretical data, allow the determination of the thickness of very thin films (< 1 mu m). We show here that a method based on this principle can be applied to thicker layers (> 1 mu m) for simultaneously measuring their optical and morphological properties, provided that a crucial step is carefully considered during the data acquisition process. This enables the simultaneous measurements of both the thickness and the refractive index (dispersion) without any prior assumptions about one of the two parameters. We demonstrate the proposed method by accurate measurements on a few micrometers thick PMMA layer as well as on a SnO2 layer, which is a much more dispersive sample.

AB Nonlinear optical responses are measured to investigate the role of hetropolyacid (HPA) in porphyrin-Lindqvist type {similar to P-M@HPA} hybrid systems, {where P-M@HPA = [(TBA)(8){(MTPPN4)(Mo6O18)(4})]; M = 2H (1) and Mn (2)}. The well-known Z-scan technique with wavelength (lambda) = 532 nm and pulse duration of tau = 6 ns is used. The results clearly show the significant enhancement in nonlinear self-defocusing effect and reverse saturable absorption under closed and open-aperture configuration for P-M@HPA hybrids. It is also observed that the second hyperpolarizability gamma values, {1 (4.639 x 10(-29) esu) < 2 (5.214 x 10(-29) esu)}, are directly proportional to the discrepancy of LUMO level (Delta E) values {1 (2.214 eV) < 2 (2.339 eV)} while they are inversely proportional to the HOMO-LUMO energy gap E-g values {1 (2.003 eV) > 2 (1.862 eV)} in the P-M@HPA hybrid system where the porphyrin moiety acts as electron donor whilst HPA acts as electron acceptor. Therefore, the emergence of a facile electron transformation from the porphyrin moieties to the low-lying LUMO levels of HPA is mainly responsible for the enhancement in nonlinear optical responses of P-M@HPA hybrids system. As a consequence the hybrid compounds can be fascinating for optical limiting applications.

AB Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), outstanding flexible and photoelectric materials, have inspired tremendous innovations in the fields of stretchable and wearable electronics. Exquisite optoelectronic materials are decorated on carbon nanotube walls is an universal method under modification process for CNT. This modification promotes the light-matter interactions and efficient charge-transfer pathways. In this respect, it is still challenging to prepare excellent CNT composites and fabricate state-of-the-art carbon-based flexible electronic devices effectly. Herein, we designed a MoS2-decorated CNT photoelectric composite materials by a facile self-assembly method, which realized exact compatibility and ingenious connection of CNT and MoS2. The flexible photoelectric electronic devices were fabricated by micro-nanofabrication technologies. The photocurrent of CNT-MoS2 exhibited 4 times higher than pure CNT materials, which showed superior photoresponse and recovery ability. The photoinduced charge transfer theory proved that the MoS2 is exceedingly good optical gain materials and benefiting from the interfacial charge-transfer transition. Therefore, the MoS2 can serve as a complement in applications that require excellent photovoltaic semiconductors, which has potential for abstaining the novel proporties nanomaterial system. The enhancement of photosensing performance showing the broad prospect of the burgeoning high performance wearable sensors.

AB In order to designing an ultrasensitive biosensor with high detection accuracy, a bimetallic (Al/Au) structure is proposed. Further sensitivity enhancement is obtained by applying Si nanosheet and some 2D materials. Few-layer phosphorene, graphene and tungsten disulfide are selected to enhance the angular sensitivity of the biosensor. Different coupling prisms are examined due to obtaining the best response. Considering the achievable highest sensitivity together with smallest minimum reflectance values, the optimized number of layers for each material is selected. Finally, 258% sensitivity enhancement with 3 nm Au, 7 nm Si and 5 layers of phosphorene on Al surface is obtained compared with bare Al-based SPR biosensor.

AB This paper demonstrates the appropriateness of the Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE), a non destructive optical characterization technique in analyzing the optical properties of a few layers of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in NIR-UV-Vis range of spectrum. The paper discusses the study of the optical properties of RGO sample prepared by exposing GO to natural sunlight. The Drude-Lorentz model is used to extract the optical constants of RGO from the ellipsometric measurement. This paper investigates how the optical parameters change due to the variations in the degree of reduction along with the presence of defects on RGO sheets. The result reveals that the refractive index (n) and the extinction coefficient (k) increase, with the increase in the level of reduction. The effect of the variations in structural defects and the presence of functional groups on the absorption coefficient are studied. The paper also discusses the sensitivity of ellipsometry in analyzing the variations in the dielectric constant due to presence of the residual oxygen moieties. Such detailed optical characterization of RGO samples has great potential application in deciding the best suitable reduction technique for developing specific optical device.

AB The AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes (DUV-LEDs) with a graded superlattice hole reservoir layer (HRL) can significantly enhance hole injection efficiency, compared with the traditional LED. We have systematically studied by APSYS software. The application of new structure can obtain higher output power and carrier concentrations, and further influence the carrier recombination rate. The DUV-LEDs with a graded superlattice HRL can obviously improve internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and alleviate efficiency droop. The improved performance is mainly attributed to the higher electron potential height and lower hole potential height, so it enhances electron confinement and hole injection. Thereby, the proposed structure effectively improve the photoelectric performance.

AB A potential organic nonlinear optical (NLO) material 3-(4-dimethylamino)phenyl)1-(4-methoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1 -one (DMLNH2MC) with a molecular formula C18H19NO2 has been synthesized and crystallized in ethanol solution. The crystals of DMLNH2M were characterized using NMR and FTIR spectroscopy techniques and the functional groups present in the molecule are identified. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies established the thermal stability of DMLNH2M crystal. The crystal is thermally stable up to 300 degrees C and melts at 129 degrees C. Single crystal X-ray diffraction data of DMLNH2M confirms the monoclinic crystal structure with, P2(1) space group. The phase purity of the crystal was determined using powder X-ray diffraction method. Hirshfeld surface analysis of the molecule was performed to visualize the presence of C-H center dot center dot center dot O and C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. UV Visible spectral studies show that the material is transparent in the entire visible region with a band gap energy of 3.32 eV. Z-scan technique is used to determine the third-order NLO parameters and optical limiting (OL) using a Diode-Pumped Solid StateLaser operating at 532 nm wavelength. The results of optical limiting studies show that the material exhibits two photo assisted excited state absorption, leading to reverse saturable absorption (RSA). High melting point, thermal stability, transparency in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, negative value of nonlinear refractive index n 2 (-1.79 x 10(-9) cm(2) W-1) leading to self defocusing effect and optical limiting threshold of 4.32 kJ/cm(2) of the material makes it a potential NLO material.

AB Degradation of Silicone used in high power white LEDs as molding material has significant impact on the LED's lifetime and efficacy. This work provides a detail study on the impact of moisture, temperature and thermal aging on the packaging materials by tracing its progression of degradation under high temperature and humidity conditions. Silicone degradation via discoloration and cracks formation is identified and its cracks depth is found to decrease as the time progressesdue to diffusion mechanism and this led to highly distorted surface. It is found that Silicone undergo hydrolysis, condensation, thermal oxidation and thermal aging over its lifespan, and discoloration is mainly due to hydrolysis while cracks formation is mainly due to thermal oxidation. The decrease in the crack depth is due to thermal aging where diffusion of silicon oligomer occurs.

The crystal particles are relatively regular and average particle size is about 15 mu m. By mixing BSSO (or CSSO) with Lu-2.(94)A1(5)O(12): 0.06Ce (LuAG) phosphors, the converted LED show a warm white light with the correlated color temperature (CCT) in the range of 2500K-5000K with the highest luminescence efficiency (LE) as 153 lm/W. In temperature dependent testing, the emission intensity of BSSO increase by 1.83%, 6.14%, 6.51% and 2.18% compared with that of CSSO in 323 K, 373 K, 423 K and 473 K, respectively. The grain surface is corroded increasingly in the accelerated aging tests of thermal cycling, hydrolysis reaction, high temperature and high humidity (85 degrees C/RH85%). In three tests, emission intensity of BSSO enhanced 11.24%, 40.54% and 20.52% compared with that of CSSO, separately. The results indicated that BSSO phosphor has higher reliability and thermal stability than CSSO phosphor in a negative external environment for warm LED application.

AB In this work, an airtight solid-state strategy was developed for the synthesis of K2TiF6:Mn4+ phosphor without the usage of high concentration HF solution. By heating K2TiF6, K2MnF6 and KHF2 in a sealed container at 474 K for hours and then washing the as-synthesized samples several times, K2TiF6:Mn4+ phosphor was obtained. The microstructure, luminescent properties of the phosphor were investigated systemically. The reaction mechanism were investigated and discussed in detail. KHF2 is the key role to obtain the red phosphor, which provides additional pressure and HF gas atmosphere, works as reaction intermediate and contributes to Mn4+ doping into K2TiF6 host. By using as-prepared K2TiF6:Mn4+ phosphor as a red componet for warm W-LEDs, the high color rendering index (Ra = 84) and low color temperature (CCT = 3621 K) device performance proved that this environmental friendly synthesis method would be an efficient way to produce red fluoride phosphor for W.LEDs.

AB Polymer waveguide bridges up to 1.2 mm in length were optically written between two single-mode optical fibres. Optical Nonlinearity of polymer waveguide was measured by coupling a high power ultra-short pulsed laser. Before waveguide fabrication fiber ends were treated by adhesion promoter which covalently bond to both the silica fibre and the photopolymer, also photopolymerization was conducted from both fibres. The new techniques improve both the mechanical properties and optical transmission of polymer bridges. The optical insertion loss was 1.1 dB for the longest waveguides. A considerably long interaction length of polymer waveguide allows spectral broadening and self-phase modulation features to occur in response to the high power laser propagation through the polymer bridges. The spectral broadening in polymer waveguide was much broader than that of 1.5 m plain fibre. The ultrafast nonlinearity of the polymer waveguides was determined to be of the order of 10(3 )times the nonlinearity of silica.

AB In this work, I have been prepared a series of different concentration of Pr3+ doped TeO2-ZnO-YF3 -NaF (TZYN) new oxyfluoro tellurite glasses by conventional melt-quenching technique. The oxyfluoro glass-ceramics were obtained by controlled heat treatment of 0.2 mol% Pr3+ doped glass at 390 degrees C, equal to the crystallization temperature (T-c1) obtained from DSC analysis, for different time intervals 5, 10 and 15h. The precipitation of alpha-NaYF4 phase was confirmed by comparison of measured X-ray diffraction patterns with alpha-NaYF4 JCPDS patterns. In glass ceramics, the intensity of the transitions,P- 3(0)-> F-3(2), in VIS, and D-1(2)-> F-3(4) &(1)G(4) in NIR regions was enhanced by 24.03, 9.4 and 4.54 times, respectively. Moreover, with heat treatment time, an experimental lifetime of the( 3)P(0) excited state of Pr3+ ion was also enhanced from 24 is in glasses to 62 mu s in glass-ceramics due to by the enhancement of crystallite size of precipitation of NaYF4 nanocrystals.

AB This article summarizes investigations on nonlinear optical properties of Zn doped TiO2 nano-colloidal suspension under pulsed excitation. Zn (1, 2 and 5 wt%) doped TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized using sol-gel method. Ultraviolet-visible studies revealed maximum blue shifting of absorption wavelength due to quantum size effect for undoped TiO2 NPs. Zn doped TiO2 NPs show slight increase in the absorption wavelength attesting the increase in the particle size with Zn doping. X-ray diffraction pattern confirms the presence of anatase phase of crystalline TiO2 with average crystallite size of 6 nm. FESEM and TEM micrographs attest formation of uniform spherical like TiO2 NPs. Nonlinear optical properties of these nano-colloids have been studied using open and closed aperture Z-scan technique employing the fundamental at 1064 nm of a 7ns mode-locked Nd-YAG laser operating at 10 Hz. 5 wt% Zn doped TiO2 nano-colloids show enhanced nonliear refractive and absorption coefficients.

AB We provide data of density functional theory (DFT) calculations of total and partial densities of states of TlHgBr3 using the method of augmented plane wave-local orbitals. The calculated density of states yields information regarding hybridization between the electronic states and on the chemical bonding of TlHgBr3. The DFT calculations predict that the principal contributors to the valence band (VB) of TlHgBr3 are 4p electronic states of bromine atoms at the central and upper regions of the band, with their slightly smaller input in other VB regions. Substantial contributions of 6s electronic states of thallium atoms lie at the upper part and bottom of the VB, and 6s states of mercury atoms occupy the bottom attributing to a specific electronic structure of TlHgBr3. The unoccupied Hg 6s electronic states, with somewhat lesser input of the unoccupied Br 4p states, contribute to the lower part of the conduction band (CB) of TlHgBr3. The theoretically derived electronic band structure demonstrates that the CB minimum and the VB maximum are positioned at the point Z of the Brillouin zone denoting a direct nature of band gap. Basic optical constants of TlHgBr3 are explored in the present work in relation to calculated electronic band structure.

AB Single crystal of L-Histidine Nitrate monohydrate (LHNM) has been grown from aqueous solution by evaporation technique. A comprehensive investigation of the NIR FT-Raman and FT-IR spectra was carried out with the aid of normal coordinate analysis following the scaled quantum mechanical force field methodology supported by the density functional theory (DFT) computations to analyze the effects of intramolecular charge transfer on the geometries and the vibrational modes contributing to the linear electro-optic effect of the organic NLO material. Effect of protonation and hydrogen bonding interactions has been analyzed using structural analysis, natural bond orbital analysis, and spectral analysis. The HOMO-LUMO energy gap value suggests the possibility of charge transfer within the molecule. Hyperconjugative interactions responsible for second hyperpolarizabilities have been described by NBO and AIM analyses. Hirshfeld surface analysis reveals that the van der Waals H center dot center dot center dot H (32.3%) contact plays a significant role in crystal packing and that a variety of N-H center dot center dot center dot O intermolecular contacts and hydrogen bonds leads to the formation of intermolecular charge transfer occurring in LHNM. The nonlinear refractive index (n(2)), nonlinear absorption coefficient (beta) and third-order nonlinear susceptibility (chi(3)) of LHNM have been determined by Z-scan technique, which points to its potential application in the field of optical limiting. The calculated value of laser damage threshold was 2.04 GW/cm(2).

ID SINGLE-CRYSTALS; GROWTH; LUMINESCENCE
AB This study focused on the influence of Mg codoping, non-stoichiometry and Ga-admixture on the scintillation and luminescence characteristics of Ce-doped lutetiumaluminum garnet crystals (LuAG), the stability of the Ce valence and the role of defects.
   For the Ce-doped LuAG samples, codoping of Mg at a concentration around 300 ppm led to improvement of overall scintillation efficiency, which is in accordance with previous studies and can be attributed to an alternative scintillation mechanism involving Ce2+ stabilized by Mg2+. Very significant improvement of the overall scintillation efficiency (almost a factor of 2) and exceptionally high light yield when compared to the stoichiometric sample was observed for the Ce0.2% Mg 300 ppm sample grown from the melt with 3 atomic % Al-rich nonstoichiometry. This was explained by enhanced energy transfer towards the Ce3+ luminescence center via defect levels induced by non-stoichiometry. The highest Mg concentration brings additional slow components to the scintillation decay.
   Very similar trends were observed for the Ga-admixed LuGAG, but the defect luminescence was strongly suppressed. Suppression of this competitive luminescence channel led to further improvement of the overall scintillation efficiency. Interestingly, X-ray diffraction has shown that the crystals contain two or even three garnet phases with very close compositions.

AB Recently, after the first demonstration of efficient, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), these devices have been widely investigated, and several new materials (hole and electron transport materials) have been reported. In this work, we demonstrate highly efficient TADF OLEDs with a simplified structure, and systematically characterize these partially evaluated reported materials; (4s,6s)-2,4,5,6,-tetra(9H-carbazol-9-ypisophthalonitrile (4CzIPN) has been used as a TADF emissive dopant; the exciton blocking and carrier transport characteristics of 9,9'-Diphenyl-6-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-9H,9'H-3,3'-bicarbazole (Tris-PCz) and 2,7-bis(2,2'-bipyridin-5-yl)triphenylene (BPy-TP2) have been characterized and compared with those of other widely used wellknown organic materials. The demonstrated simplified TADF OLEDs with a 4CzIPN doped single emissive layer showed a high peak external quantum efficiency and power efficiency of 18.6% and 31.5 lm/W, respectively.

AB Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as an alternative energy resource in recent years, due to low-cost fabrication and non-toxic compared to silicon-based and thin film solar cells. Herein, the natural dye containing anthocyanins were extracted from Thunbergia erecta natural flower petals by simple extraction techniques and used as photosensitizers in the DSSC. The extracts showed the UV-Vis absorptions in the 400-800 nm range with broad maxima in visible region around 537 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum was obtained after the dye coating on a semi-conductive layer, to identify the presence of anthocyanin according to the functional groups present in the dye molecules. To precise and progressive optimization of the TiO2 photoanodes film thicknesses were prepared by spin coating technique and characterized by atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and J-V characteristics. The photovoltaic performance studies were carried out to understand the effect of the TiO2 multilayer photoanodes and the interaction with the dye molecules on the cells efficiency. Photovoltaic parameters like short circuit current (J(SC)), open circuit voltage (V-OC) and fill factor (FF) were evaluated for fabricated cells. The optimized film thickness of the TiO2 photoanode is similar to 5.5 mu m with an efficiency of 0.37% under AM 1.5G illumination of sunlight. The V-OC of DSSCs gradually decreases as the thickness increases of the TiO2 thin film and the highest conversion efficiency while it has the maximum short-circuit current density.

AB We report and analyze luminescence spectra for rectangular and trapezoidal InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) under various bias voltages using well-calibrated numerical simulations. The effect of carrier localization due to clustering of In atoms in In-rich regions is taken into account by considering quantum dot-like structure in the QW for In contents exceeding 30%. The shape of the luminescence spectra obtained from different MQWs is explained physically on the basis of energy band diagram, electric field in the well and shift of the peak of electron and hole concentrations. Our findings demonstrate that under various bias conditions the trapezoidal MQWs produce luminescence peaks at the same wavelength whereas the rectangular MQWs do not. Such a striking feature associated with the trapezoidal MQWs may be exploited for color-stable photonic applications in which varying bias conditions modulate the light intensity while maintaining the peak emission at a constant wavelength.

AB The Er3+/Yb3+-codoped lead phosphate (PPbKANErYb) glasses have been prepared by using melt quenching technique and characterized through spectroscopic studies such as absorption, emission, decay and upconversion measurements. An intense near-infrared (NIR) emission at 1.53 mu m was observed which has been explained based on the effective energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ ions. The absorption (I-4(15/2) -> I- 4(13/2)) and emission cross-section (I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/2)) of 1.53 mu m emission band was calculated and found to be of the order of 6.76 x 10(-21) and 7.9 x 10(-21)cm(2), respectively, by using the McCumber theory. The PPbKANErYb glasses exhibit higher luminescence intensity (more than 3 times) and full width at half maxima (55 nm) compared to 1.0 mol% Er3+ singly doped glass (50 nm). All the decay curves of the I-4(13/2) level exhibited single exponential nature and the lifetimes increased (1760, 1776, 1942 and 2830 mu s) with the increase of Yb2O3 (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mol %) concentration. Intense red band at 670 nm corresponding to F-4(9/2) -> I- 4(15/2) transition and green emission bands at around 530 and 555 nm corresponding to H-2(11/2) -> 4I(15/2) and S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2), transitions, respectively, have been observed under the excitation of 980 nm. The intensity of the upconversion emissions is found to be increased with the increase of Yb3+ ion concentration and its mechanism have been explained. The luminescence decay curves of the( 4)S(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) upconversion luminescence of Er3+/Yb3+ codoped PPbKAN glasses under the infrared excitation of 980 nm have been evaluated. The results reveal that the investigated glasses might be potential candidates for optical fiber amplifiers/laser sources at 1.55 mu m band.

AB In this study, ZnxCd1-xS/CdTe solar cells were fabricated on commercially available indium tin oxide (In2O3: Sn or ITO) and fluorine doped tin oxide (SnO2: F or FTO) soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates by RF magnetron sputtering. Thin ZnxCd1-xS window layers with lower zinc (Zn) content in comparison to cadmium (Cd) were deposited by co-sputtering of ZnS and CdS targets concurrently by changing the radio frequency (RF) power of both during sputtering. CdTe thin films for the complete cells were also grown by sputtering with different thickness. Prior to fabricating the complete device, characterization for growth optimization of ZnxCd1-xS window layer and CdTe absorber layer was performed by utilizing Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Hall effect measurement system. Complete ZnxCd1-xS/CdTe solar cells were fabricated with the optimized growth conditions of window and absorber layers. The best cell fabricated on ITO coated SLG substrates showed an efficiency of 8.08% with significant open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 882 mV.

AB The temperature dependences of 1.53 mu m near infrared and green upconversion (UC) emissions of Er3+ ion have been investigated in Er3+/Yb3+: BaMoO4 powders upon 980 nm excitation. Interestingly, an anomalous enhancement of 1.53 mu m luminescence intensity with increasing temperature is observed, which is interpreted based on the phonon-assisted nonradiative process from I-4(11)/2 to I-4(13/2) level. Moreover, the emission intensities from various Stark transitions I-4(13/2)(Y-i) -> I-4(15/2)(Z(j)) show different changing rates with temperature, which is in favor of optical thermometry application based on fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique. The results show that the utilization of FIR-1 (I-1504/I-1531) from two Stark transitions with the same power-dependence is beneficial to obtain consistent results at different excitation power densities, and avoid measurement error resulted from the power density variation. Besides, when FIR-Green (I-533/I-557) is used as the thermometric index, a high absolute sensitivity of 115 x 10(-4) at 430 K can be obtained. Therefore, Er3+/Yb3+: BaMoO4 is promising for optical thermometry.

AB The development of quantum dot (QD) layers as color converters in phosphor-converted white laser diodes (pc-wLDs) is restricted due to their low stability under laser irradiation. The present study aims to develop a unique color converter geometry that enables the QD layer for high-power pc-wLDs. A red emitting QD layer was coated on a thermally stable and heat-conducting Al2O3-YAG:Ce composite ceramic (CC), which played dual role of yellow emitter and heat sink. Thus, thermal and flux pressure on the QD layer has been significantly mitigated. Under irradiation of a 5 W blue laser, the operating temperature for the QD layer was as low as similar to 68 degrees C. Furthermore, the CC-QD color converter and a blue LD were combined to fabricate pc-wLDs, which have exhibited superior color properties in terms of a high color rendering index (similar to 80), a high wall-plug efficiency (similar to 91 lm/W). and tunable color temperatures. This indicates the suitability of QD layer for high-power and high color rendering laser lighting.

AB Gold nanoclusters (NCs) have received wide attention in basic physical chemistry as well as biomedical applications due to unique electronic structure and luminescence properties. However, expensive cost of gold and weak luminescence prevent their wide applications in biomedicine. Herein, bimetallic fluorescent CuAu NCs were successfully prepared, and the structural, optical properties as well as bioimaging of the CuAu NCs were investigated in detail. The CuAu NCs show the luminescence enhancement compared with Au NCs. Meanwhile, the excellent stability and photostability are also revealed by photoluminescence spectra. The structural investigations reveal that the CuAu NCs are complex clusters with molecule weight of 4.8-5.8 kDa. In addition, the CuAu NCs possess the long fluorescence lifetime of 6.55 ps, which could be associated with metal-centered triplet emission within the clusters. It is also demonstrated that the ultrastable CuAu NCs exhibit low cytotoxicity and can be used for cellular imaging.

AB With the aim to develop optical micro-sensors for "on-line measurement of spray deposits on plant leaves, and thus to optimize the use of phytosanitary inputs in agriculture, straight waveguides based on Ge-Se-Te chalcogenide layers were elaborated and their sensitivity to water droplet deposition was tested. As expected, water, the main constituent of pesticides, absorbed part of the evanescent wave of the guided light, which led to a decrease in the intensity transmitted at the output of the waveguides. Both experimental and simulation results proved that the position of the drop on the waveguide had no impact on the intensity measured at the guide outlet. At the opposite, they highlighted the correlation between the light intensity at the outlet and the volume and number of deposited droplets: the greater the volume of the drop and the greater the number of drops, the greater the decrease in intensity.

AB The electronic and nonlinear optical properties of new multifunctional tetrathiafulvalene-appended azine derivatives were investigated. The new ligands consist of TTF electron donor connected by pyridyl spacer to dimethylphenyl or dinitrophenyl group which act as electron acceptor. The nonlinear optical parameters were investigated by SHG and THG measurements carried by means of the Maker fringe technique for the thin films of PMMA with embedded molecules. The THG was also measured for the PLD prepared films. The results of theoretical studies performed by DFT/LC-BLYP and ab-initio quantum chemical calculations are presented. The UV-vis absorption spectra were computed using DFT method. The influence of the high dipole moment of the ligands and their intermolecular interaction at the linear and nonlinear optical properties were discussed.

ID SCATTERING PATTERNS; DESIGN; FABRICATION; COATINGS
AB Thin film perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on (CH3NH3PbI3) have been emerged as good alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells due to their low cost, low fabrication temperature, high carrier collection efficiency, and high-power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the small thickness of thin film solar cells limits light absorption compared to thick solar cells. In this work, we proposed a theoretical design for enhancing light absorption to achieve maximum theoretical photocurrent using front dielectric and back plasmonic wire grating. Using finite element method (FEM) three-dimensional optical model, the optimum size and periodicity of the studied wire grating nanostructures were identified. Additionally, the electrical model revealed a satisfactory enhancement in PCE over that of the planar structure counterpart. The simulation results showed an average enhancement of 22.4% in total generation rate for the entire simulated wavelength, and more than 85% enhancement in narrow-band wavelength compared to the planar structure counterpart.

AB The effect of thermal annealing temperature on both structural and optical properties of amorphous As47.5Se47.5Ag5 thin films was studied. The XRD studies showed that the crystallinity of the studied films is improved by increasing the annealing temperature. Furthermore, the crystallite size increase whereas dislocation density and strain decrease with increasing the annealing temperature. The optical constants of the asprepared and annealed As47.5Se47.5Ag5 thin films were calculated using the envelope method. The optical absorption data of these films was successfully described by Tauc's relation. The optical absorption mechanism was found to follow the allowed direct and indirect transitions. In addition, it was found that the optical band gap decreases while band width E, increases as the annealing temperature increases. The data of the refractive index n was analyzed and discussed in terms of the single oscillator model proposed by Wemple-DiDomenico. Besides that, the non-linear optical parameters chi((1)), chi((3)) and n(2) were determined as a function of the annealing temperature.

AB The suppression of the opal crystal luminescence under infiltration of graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONP) into interglobular cavities of a photonic crystal (PC@GONP) was found. Additionally a 3-fold decrease of the Raman signal from the graphene oxide and a 10-fold increase of the PC@GONP absorbance were simultaneously found leading to an improved contrast of the PC and a 21 nm red shift of the optical transmittance minimum in the PC stop zone region. The comparison of the surface mapping of PC@GONP with GONP deposited on a Si/SiO2 (Si/SiO2@GONP) surface was done using D and G graphene Raman bands. Raman spectra details allowed to find noticeable changes in the D-to-G modes intensity ratio and their peak positions for both GONP-based samples suggesting their significant spectroscopic and structural heterogeneity. A small number of structural defects was observed in the PC@GONP that improve optical and crystalline properties of GONP. A Clear observation of the Raman active opal and GONP modes simultaneously with the appearance of the second order Raman bands within 2000-3500 cm(-1) range that are absent in the Raman spectra of the pristine GONP suggests the formation of new bonds of graphene at the interface, a structural modification of the graphene oxide in the PC nanocavities, and a modification of Raman selection rules.

AB Two new isomeric pyrene based chalcone derivatives (E)-3-(3,4-dimethoxy-5-(methoxy-methyl)phenyl)-1-(pyren-1-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (1) and (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxy-5-(methoxy-methyl)phenyl)-3-(pyren-1-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (2) were designed and synthesized for ultrafast broadband nonlinear optics. Z-scan and transient transmission measurements were performed to investigate the differences of regioisomer on nonlinear optics. Both derivatives display reverse saturable absorption as a result of two-photon absorption (TPA). It was found that both pi-electron delocalization and intramolecular charge transfer contribute to the TPA and thus influence the nonlinear properties. What's more, remarkable enhancement of TPA cross-section (2400 GM) is observed in 2 as a result of intermediate state resonance enhancement (ISRE). All the studies suggest that these derivatives possess the potential for optical data storage and optical limiting. Moreover, our study further proved the superiority of ISRE on enhancing the TPA of nonlinear materials.

AB In the doubly doped YAG:Ce,Er single crystal we show the effect of the nonradiative energy transfer from the donor (Ce3+) to the acceptor (Er3+) in terms of the Forster-Dexter model. Such an energy transfer process is enabled by the overlap of the donor and acceptor emission and absorption spectra, respectively, and makes the donor to de-excite faster. This phenomenon can be used to tailor the luminescence decay of a phosphor in order to increase the rate at which it converts incoming radiation, if the decrease of its quantum efficiency can be tolerated. Quantitative comparison of experimental data obtained at the sample set with large concentration interval of Er3+ acceptor (up to the concentration Y2.835Al5O12:Ce0 .006Er0.159) with the mentioned theoretical model allows the determination of the microscopic parameters of the energy transfer process, such as the critical concentration of the EP + ions. The Er concentration higher than 1% has proven to shorten the 1/e decay time from 62 ns below 30 ns. The concentration dependence of the absorption lines of the Er3+ is also discussed.

AB The objective of this paper is to improve the sensitivity and the performance of nano-sensors by using the simulation, which was done by finite element method in 2D plasmonic nanostructures. Meanwhile, the effects of geometric parameters of a hexagonal gold nanostructure, and the influence of two dielectrics Si3N4 and SiOx were treated. In order to have better sensitivity, the nature and the thickness of a deposed dielectric were controlled. Whenever we change the geometric parameters of the metallic nanostructure, we see changes in nanoparticle's plasmonic response. Adjusting the theoretical curve to experimental LSPR curve allowed the geometry of the plasmonic interface to be fixed and evaluation of the change in the wavelength at resonance (lambda(R)) as a function of the SiOx overlayers thickness. The theoretical data were compared with experimental results obtained on glass/Au nanowires/SiOx and glass/Au Nanowires/Si3N4 interfaces.

AB Lack of red-light of current w-LEDs restricts their applications in the field of high color rendering index warm solid-state lighting. Fluoride phosphors doped with Mn4+ provide an efficient way to resolve the problem. Unfortunately, these excellent Mn4+ activated fluoride red phosphors are generally synthesized in highly toxic HE solution. In this paper, we report a novel green synthetic route to prepare a non-rare-earth and nonequivalent doping type of K2NbF7:Mn4+ red phosphor with micro-rod-like morphology. The results of XRD and its Rietveld refinement reveal that all the samples possessed only a single phase with monoclinic P21/c structure and the Mn4+ ions were successfully incorporated into the crystal lattice. The Mn4+ ions in K2NbF7 matrix have a highly distorted octahedral environment, which strengthen the intensity of zero phonon line (ZPL). The strongest absorption and excitation bands appear in blue region of diffuse refection spectra (DRS) and the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) of K2NbF7:Mn4+ sample, which demonstrates the product perfectly match with the most popular GaN-based blue chip. Under blue light illumination, the as-prepared K 2 NbF 7 :Mn 4+ sample exhibits intense sharp-line red fluorescence (similar to 628 nm) with internal quantum yield (QY) of 71.3%, an extreme narrow full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of similar to 2.8 nm, and an ultra-high-color purity of 99.2%. Impressively, by incorporating K2NbF7:Mn4+ as a red component, a warm w-LED with high CR1 of 83.8, low color temperature of 3010 K and high luminous efficiency of 115.91 lm/W is obtained, demonstrating great validity of K2NbF7:Mn4+ red phosphor for white LED devices.

AB In this work, uniform porous EuBO3 microwafers were obtained by calcining Eu-based coordination polymer (CP) which were synthesized by a facile solvothermal method without any mineralizer addition. The products were fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence (PL). The diameter and thickness of the EuBO3 microwafers are approximately 3 mu m and 0.6 mu m, respectively. Under lambda(ex) = 394 nm, photoluminescence spectrum of EuBO3 is observed in 570-720 nm, which are attributed to the D-8(0)-F-7(J) (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions. Further investigations reveal that the porous EuBO3 microwafer is a highly selective and sensitive oxalate sensor, with the limit of detection (LOD) as low as 1 x 10(-8 )M. Overall, this study provide a convenient route for the synthesis of rare earth borate. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to demonstrate that EuBO3 is a viable probe for sensing oxalate.

AB Tunable multicolour emitting Eu3+ activated Terbium oxalate nanophosphors synthesised by simple microwave assisted co-precipitation method is bring forth. The powder X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the crystal system of synthesised nanophosphors as monoclinic system with space group P2(1)/c. The photoluminescence properties and energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu(3+)ions were analyzed systematically. The luminescence emission spectra and decay curves were analyzed based on the relative fraction of Tb3+/Eu3+ ions in oxalate matrix. Evidences for efficient energy transfer and the subsequent multicolour emission from green to red in the oxalate matrix were established by photoluminescence excitation, emission and decay kinetics. The present investigation revealed a dipole-dipole interaction mechanism for energy transfer between Tb3+ and Eu3+ with an energy transfer efficiency of 90%. The quenching free nature of oxalate matrix provided by the structure specificity ensures higher luminescence performance and makes it a suitable candidate for optical applications.

AB The work is dedicated to investigation of the luminescent properties of YAlO3 (YAP) and Lu0.95Y0.05AlO3 (LuYAP) crystals, grown from the melt by different crystallization methods. The intrinsic luminescent properties of YAP and LuYAP crystals were compared also with behavior of single crystalline films of these perovskites, grown using the liquid phase epitaxy method from the melt-solution based on the PbO-B2O3 flux. The significant differences in the luminescent properties of YAP and LuYAP crystals were observed. These differences are explained by the various concentrations of the Y-Al and Lu-Al antisite defects (ADs) and oxygen vacancies formed during high-temperature crystallization of YAP and LuYAP crystals from the melt at the temperatures above 2000 degrees C. The ADs and oxygen vacancies form in YAP and LuYAP crystals the different types of emission centers in the UV and visible ranges. The luminescence of defect centers in the 4.1-6.2 eV range are related to the emission of exciton localized around and bound with the ADs as analogues of cations isoelectronic impurities. The emission centers of YAP and LuYAP crystals in the 2.75-4.1 eV range are formed by F+ and F centers. Apart from the intrinsic radiative transitions of F+ and F centers, the luminescence of excitons localized around F and F+ related centers in YAP and LuAP crystals is found as well. The emission bands of YAP and LuAP crystals in the visible range probably are caused by the aggregates of F+ and F centers.

AB Tunable multi-wavelength mode-locked ytterbium-doped fiber laser is realized by using ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets as saturable absorber. g-C3N4 nanosheets with an average thickness of 3.5 nm are obtained through liquid-phase ultrasonic exfoliation of g-C3N4 powder prepared by high temperature sintering. Passively mode-locked ytterbium-doped fiber laser was obtained by using the g-C3N4 nanosheets coated D-shaped fiber as saturable absorber. It is interesting that tunable dual-, triple- and quadruple-wavelength mode-locked lasers were obtained by adjusting the pump power and polarization controller. And the maximum average output power of the mode-locked laser can reach 10.32 mW. The pulse width of the quadruple-wavelength mode-locked laser is 1.9 ns, with a working repetition of 11.2 MHz. To our best knowledge, this is the first time reporting this tunable multi-wavelength mode-locking phenomenon based on g-C3N4.

AB Singly doped Tb3+ and Sm3+ ions along with co-doped Tb3+/Sm3+ borate glasses have been fabricated by melt quenching technique. Both TGA and DSC curves were measured for exploration of thermal properties. Among all Tb3+/Sm3+ co-doped glasses, the (Tb0.5-Sm0.5) glass shows the highest emission intensity with respect to others. A total of five emission bands where two are from Tb3+ transitions corresponding to 488 nm (blue) (D-5(4) -> F- 7(6)) and 543 nm (green) (D-5(4) -> F-7(5)) are found. Three emission bands from Sm3+ at 563 nm (green), 599 nm (orange-red) and 645 nm (red) according to (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(5/2), (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2), and (4)G(5/2) -> 6H(9/2) electronic transitions are identified. The calculated CIE chromaticity (x,y) coordinates for singly doped Tb3+ (Tb0.5) green emission, singly doped Sm3+ (Sm0.5) orange-red emission, and co-doped Tb3+/Sm3+ (Tb0.5-Sm0.5) yellow emission are (0.343, 0.584), (0.607, 0.389), and (0.438, 0.515), respectively, following the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram. Further, dielectric features were studied for the Tb3+/Sm(3+)co-doped glass (Tb0.5-Sm0.5) in terms of dielectric constant, dielectric loss and AC conductivity with the increasing of frequency and temperature.

AB In this paper, we evaluated the doping density and spatial distribution of Ce3+ ions in a LiCaAlF6 single crystal. We observed the heterogeneity of Ce3+-doped LiCaAlF6 using Multi-Photon Luminescence Measurement. Further, we employed laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to perform elementary analysis. We measured the concentration and distribution of Ce, Li, Ca, and Al. The luminescence intensity increased in proportion to the Ce concentration. Therefore, our evaluation method, which measures the multiphoton luminescence intensity, can possibly be employed to analyze the concentration and distribution of a low amount of elements due to luminescence. Additionally, we can evaluate the luminescence materials non-destructively and three-dimensionally by this measurement. This method could be a dominant tool for evaluation of luminescent materials compared with the conventional methods.

AB An aqueous route based on electrostatics for preparing heterostructures from carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Zinc Sulfide doped with manganese (ZnS:Mn) is demonstrated. This was achieved by one-pot synthesis of negatively charged multiwalled carbon nanotubes and positively charged ZnS quantum dots, in a reaction driven by the electrostatic interaction between the binary components. The structural and optical properties of the heterostructures were characterized by particle size, zeta potential, x-ray diffraction, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and photoluminescence measurements. A size-restriction effect of the CNTs on the growth of the ZnS nanoparticles during synthesis was observed, particle sizes of the prepared composites were smaller with higher amounts of CNT. Remarkably, all ZnS:Mn/CNT composites showed a blue shift of in the excitation spectra compared to ZnS:Mn only. Further experiments attributed the blue shift to an increased band gap of the ZnS:Mn, originating from an effective electrostatic interaction between the CNT and the attached ZnS:Mn. This effect was indicative of an intimate contact between the CNTs and the ZnS:Mn which was affirmed by images obtained from Transmission Electron Microscopy as well. Composites with such controlled morphology between the binary components are relevant in the fabrication of inorganic nanomaterial-carbon nanotube heterostructures, directed towards applications in optoelectronics.

AB Polydimethylsiloxane elastomers are largely employed in soft lithographic replication for the realization of microstructures that find application in microfluidic and micro-engineering. In the last years micro and nano patterned ordered structures have gained remarkable attention for their employment in the development of biomedical devices, smart displays, chemical and physical sensors. Here a 2D quasi-hemispherical micro voids elastomeric grating has been successfully realized and it has been demonstrated that this structure can be considered a simple, low cost reversible strain sensor. Specifically, the sensor permits simultaneous determination of the strain-stress information analyzing the voids' spacing based on Debye diffraction distance. A model from Continuum Mechanics has been employed in order to assess its optical response, meaning to predict the mechanical deformation of the patterned surface of the sample and to corroborate the accuracy of the optical measurements. The results demonstrate that the 2D quasi-hemispherical micro voids sensing system can be considered as a complementary approach respect to the traditional strain sensors.

AB Unlike most two-dimensional materials, h-BN nanoplatelets (BNNPs) exhibit multi-photon absorption. This was previously attributed to a two-photon absorption (2PA) process at 1.16 eV by Kumbhakar et al., Advanced Optical Materials, 3, 828, 2015. This is counter-intuitive because a 2PA process at 1.16 eV cannot excite electrons across the wide band gap of BNNPs (similar to 5.75 eV). Here, through systematic experimental and theoretical work, we provide compelling evidence that BNNPs exhibit five-photon absorption (5PA) at a low-laser fluence ( < 0.6 J/cm(2)). Furthermore, we show that a high laser fluence ( > 0.6 J/cm(2)) generates photo-induced defects in BNNPs that support a 2PA process. Accordingly, we assert that BNNPs inherently exhibit 5PA at a low laser fluence. In the previous study reported by Kumbhakar et al. a high laser fluence was used, which led to the observation of 2PA process.

AB Topological Weyl semimetals are a new class of quantum materials with 3D Dirac electronic states. A variety of novel electronic and optoelectronic properties have been observed in Weyl semimetals, which make them highly promising for future electronic, spintronic, and optoelectronic devices. Here, we report the generation of surface plasmon polaritons at visible wavelengths in the topological Weyl semimetal WTe2. We find that the plasmonic resonance can be distinctly formed in the WTe2 nanograting configuration. The resonance wavelength is dependent on the width of the nanograting. Our finding in the Weyl semimetal will open a new avenue for plasmonic control and devices in high frequency region.

AB This work reports the signal enhancement of Yb3+/Er3+ codoped PbO-GeO2 pedestal waveguides due to gold nanoparticles deposited over the core layer. The pedestal structure was obtained by conventional photolithography and plasma etching with a new procedure that does not use metallic hard-masks that normally introduce roughness, leading to light scattering. This new procedure brings advantages that benefit light guiding, reducing the propagation losses. Yb (3+)/Er3+ codoped PbO-GeO2 thin film was obtained by RF Magnetron Sputtering deposition and was used as core layer (410 nm height). In order to cover the core with gold nanoparticles the sputtering technique was used, followed by annealing at 400 degrees C during 1 h. The minimum propagation losses obtained were of 1.0 dB/cm at 1068 nm. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed for the waveguides structure inspection and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) was used to verify the presence of gold nanoparticles on the waveguides. It was observed an enhancement of 180% for the relative gain that reached 7.8 dB/cm at 1530 nm, for an optical waveguide with 6 pm core width, under 980 nm excitation (pump power of 60 mW), attributed to the local field enhancement in the vicinity of the gold nanoparticles. The new fabrication process presented in this work opens possibilities for optical amplifiers with low propagation losses based on different metal dielectric composites, as well as other waveguide-based devices.

Mn-doped CdSe QDs observed to growth larger QDs compared to pure CdSe QDs at significantly same reaction times. The lattice parameter compressed with QDs sizes growth due to the introduction of lattice strain provoked by the incorporation of Mn atoms into CdSe QDs lattice. The Mn-doped CdSe QDs shows a slight blue-shift on absorption and emission spectra's compared to pure CdSe even though is possessed larger QDs. The band gap structure modification prominently affected by the lattice strain were transition of Stokes, Rayleigh to anti-Stokes shifts observed as the Mn-doped CdSe QDs size growth. The typical red-shift of absorption and emission wavelength observed with growth of QDs sizes. The role of oleic acid as a surfactant and capping agent shows in FTIR spectra. The lattice strain tailored the binding energy between the ion prominently on the surface of the QDs with growth of QDs sizes.

AB Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties have emerged as cheaper alternatives to high-performance phosphorescent OLEDs with noble-metal-based dopants. In this work, five p-diphenylsulphone derivatives bearing different substitutes (R = H (1a), tert-butyl (1b), tri-fluoromethyl (1e), carbazolyl (1d) and diphenylamine (1e)) were designed and synthesized. Their photophysical properties were investigated via spectroscopic and theoretical methods. These materials emit violet to blue fluorescence ranging from 326 to 488 nm in dichloromethane solution, and show long-lived luminescence with lifetimes ranging from 7.38 to 13.85 us. The maximal wavelength of UV absorption and photoluminescence are red-shifted in accordance with not only the electron-donating ability of the terminal substituents, but also the extension of the pi-conjugation. The photoluminescent properties as well as crystal structure were investigated with the aim of providing the basis for elucidating structure-physical property relationships in the context of potentially efficient OLED materials.

AB We have interpreted the two-photon absorption spectrum of water-soluble copper indium sulfide (CIS) QDs with stoichiometry 0.18 (Cu), 0.42 (In), and 2 (S) and an average diameter of approximately 2.6 nm. For that, we employed the wavelength-tunable femtosecond Z-scan technique and the parabolic effective-mass approximation model, in which the excitonic transition energies were phenomenologically corrected due to the stoichiometry of the nanocrystal. This model considers a conduction band and three valence sub-bands allowing excitonic transitions via centrosymmetric (Delta l = +/- 1, where l is the angular momentum of the absorbing state) and non-centrosymmetric (Delta l= 0) channels. In such case, this became relevant because the CIS QDs with chalco- pyrite crystalline structure is a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor. Thus, our experimental results pointed out two 2 PA allowed bands located at 715 nm (2hv = 3.47 eV) and 625 run (2hv = 3.97 eV) with cross sections of (6.3 +/- 1.0) x 10(2) GM and (4.5 +/- 0.7) x 10(2) GM, respectively. According to the theoretical model, these 2 PA bands can be ascribed to the 1P(1/2) (h(3))-> 1S(3/2) (e) (lower energy band) and 1P(1/2) (h(heavy)) -> 1S(3)(/2) (e) (90%)/(10%) 1P(1/2)(h(split-off)) -> 1P(3/2) (e) (higher energy band) excitonic transitions. A good agreement (magnitude and spectral position) between the experimental and theoretical data were obtained. However, our experimental data suggest that the higher-energy 2 PA band may have other contributions due to the mixing between the heavy-and the light-hole bands, which the effective mass model does not take into consideration.

AB In this work, the influence of annealing process after GaN cap layer growth on the structural and optical properties of InGaN/InGaN mutt-quantum wells has been investigated. It is found that the annealing has a positive effect on reducing the effect of the In rich layer on the subsequent growth of quantum barrier. At the same time, it is found that annealing can release stress and make the LLCs of QW more uniform, annealing will improve the interface between the quantum well and quantum barrier and reduce the influence of dislocation on the luminescence of MQW. However, a nonradiative recombination center with an activation energy around 110 meV was found to increase with annealing time.

AB Cobalt doped zinc oxide nanopowders were prepared via solid-state reaction. The influences of calcining temperatures on crystal structure, morphology, emissivity and color change of the Zn1-xCoxO nanopowders were studies detailedly. The results indicate that the substitute for Zn2+ by Co2+ in hexagonal wurtzite ZnO usefully sintering temperatures are 900-1200 degrees C. Moreover, the crystallinity, the oxygen vacancy content and the amount of Co substituted Zn(2+ )in the Zn1-xCoxO nanopowders are increasing with the heating temperature improving. All the samples show reversible thermochromism, which can reversible color change from green to yellow by rising test temperature from 25 to 800 degrees C. Meanwhile, the largest emissivity change is 0.321 as the test temperature changes between 25 and 800 degrees C in the sample heated at 1100 degrees C. The Zn1-xCoxO has great potential applications for smart adaptive camouflage in visible-infrared region.

AB In this research, crystal orientation dependences of optical properties have been investigated for magnesium barium fluoride (BaMgF4) in three-dimensional space by means of coordinate transformations. The maximum nonlinear optical coefficients dij' and refraction indices nij' along specific orientations have been determined based on experimental data of BaMgF4 and original matrices for mm2 point group. All the nonlinear optical coefficients dij' show high dependence on crystal orientations compared with refraction indices nij', the latter can be treated as a constant (1.45 +/- 0.02), which is both related to experimental data and crystal symmetry elements. The max d15' = 15 x 10(-14) m/V and the max d31' = max d32' = 27 x 10(-14) m/V can be both obtained along the spontaneous polarization axis, i.e., the Z-axis. Meanwhile, the max d24' = 26.7 x 10(-14) m/V and the max d33' = 36 x 10(-14) m/V lie along directions at angles of theta = 58 degrees and 50.2 degrees apart from the Z-axis, respectively. The result suggests that by adopting specific directions, the optical properties of BaMgF4 crystal can be optimally used.

AB The photoisomerization and thermal relaxation processes of three amphiphilic azobenzene derivatives (LCAn) showing liquid-crystalline properties were studied in solutions and in monomolecular films formed using Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett techniques. The well-controlled isomeric state of LCAn in chloroform during the UV irradiation allowed to prepare spreading solutions containing trans isomers, cis isomers or their mixture and to investigate molecular organization in the Langmuir films made of them. Surface pressure-mean molecular area isotherms and compression modulus-surface pressure dependences delivered information on a thermodynamic state, phase transitions and intermolecular interaction in the monolayers. LCAn in the trans state create densely-packed films, in which the photoisomerization do not occur due to the lack of free volume for the change of the molecules conformation and their strong tendency for the H-type aggregation. However, the reversible switching of the LCAn conformation during cyclic photoisomerization and thermal relaxation processes was observed in the LB films initially deposited onto quartz substrates in the cis state, where molecules are loosely-packed and exist in the monomeric form. Kinetics and rate constants of the photoisomerization and thermal relaxation were determined based on the recorded absorption spectra in order to obtain information on their efficiency and on the impact of the replacement of the alkyl chain attached in the LCAn para position with the alkyloxy chain. Our research show that LCAn are promising materials for application in optical memories, logic gates and holographic gratings.

AB This paper presents results of investigations of Fe+ , Ge+, Mn+ ions implanted silicon samples with the use of the modulated free carrier absorption (MFCA) technique. These ions are significant in a modern electronics. The nondestructive character of the MFCA method makes it very useful for characterization of implanted materials. Spatial distributions and profiles of the amplitudes of the modulated free carrier absorption signal of the implanted silicon samples were measured and analyzed. The amplitude and phase frequency characteristics of the MFCA signal for the ion implanted regions have been measured and interpreted for different wavelengths of the illuminating light. The dependence of the amplitude of the MFCA signal on the lifetime of carriers and the optical absorption coefficient of the implanted layer has been analyzed theoretically and discussed. The influence of the ion implantation process on the values of the optical absorption coefficient and the lifetime of carriers of the implanted layers has been determined.

AB Studies on biophysical interactions between DNA-surfactant complexes and dye molecules are necessary to fully exploit its potential in optoelectronic devices. In this work investigations on nonlinear optical absorption and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of Styryl 7 dye (LDS 750) incorporating DNA-CTMA (deoxyribonucleic acid blended with cationic surfactant molecule, cetyltrimethyl-ammonium chloride) and PMMA (Poly methyl methacrylate) is reported. The nonlinear optical studies on the sample carried out using Z scan technique exhibits reverse saturable absorption with DNA -CTMA complex but with PMMA the sample behaves as a saturable absorber. We observed ASE at low pump energy for Styryl 7-DNA-CTMA film, when excited with a pulsed nanosecond Nd: YAG laser (lambda = 532 nm) whereas ASE was not observed from dye incorporated with PMMA even with high pump energy. ASE characteristics were studied as a function of excitation energy density for the evaluation of threshold energy and exponential gain coefficient. The enhanced fluorescence and low threshold for ASE make Styryl 7 dye -DNA template a promising candidate for novel optoelectronic applications.

AB We have designed blue organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) consisting of fluorescent and phosphorescent emitters whose phosphorescent emitting layers have three step-controlled doping profiles of 0, 4 and 8%. The different doping profiles determined the characteristics of electroluminescent and fluorescent intensity variation under various voltages. Also, it was found that emission channels separated by the non-doped region enhanced fluorescent emission. The phosphorescent doping concentration adjacent to the fluorescent emitting layer is strongly related to device efficiency and the location of the non-doped region, particularly, affected the electrical and optical characteristics of the blue OLEDs due to the hole transport type of the host material. Placing the region on the anode side had the effect of widening the hole transport region, leading to higher current density. Based on this effect, the device with the regularly stepwise doping concentration (0-4-8%) showed high current density and luminance but the phosphorescent emission was dominant. The lowest efficiency roll-off was observed from the device containing the separated emission channels for fluorescence and phosphorescence by the non-doped region, which gave rise to relatively stronger fluorescent emission.

AB The use of filters in ophthalmology is not new, but usually they operate by just blocking light of a particular wavelength. In contrast, photoluminescence filters are theoretically able to provide an altered wavelength of light to reach the retina, an approach which potentially can be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Our working hypothesis is that providing a means to deliver a reduced amount of harmful UV-blue light and an increased amount of beneficial red-near infrared light to retinal neuronal mitochondria will improve the health of the tissue and so enhance the health of the retina. The purpose of this communication is a) to briefly review the evidence behind our working hypothesis, b) to propose and describe luminescent spectral conversion filters that might be used to non-invasively achieve our aims related to our hypothesis, and c] to provide some preliminary experimental data to show that such luminescent filters coated on a glass substrate can convert UV-blue light to sufficient red light to enhance cell survival in cultured cells.

For continuous-wave operation, the maximum output power reaches 3.10 W with slope efficiency of about 48.9% at 1055 nm and 2.63 W with slope efficiency of 43.1% at 1082 nm. For passively Q switched operation, using a Cr:YAG as saturable absorber, the achieved maximum average output power is 1.49 W at 1055 nm with pulse width of 18.4 ns. Moreover, we have also realized simultaneous dual-wavelength laser operation at 1055 and 1082 nm with a maximum average output power of 1.22 W and a pulse width of 19.4 ns. Furthermore, inserting an etalon for suppressing the 1055 nm line, we have operated single wavelength laser at 1082 run with output power of 0.31 W and pulse width of 20.8 ns. This work has verified the potential of Nd:LMA crystal as a laser gain medium.

AB Fluorescent carbon dots are optically unique materials that have many applications, including photocatalysis, drug delivery, and biosensing. In this work, carbon dots were synthesized in high yields from succinic acid and glycerol using a green, one-step hydrothermal method, and without the addition of acid or base catalysts. Blue-and green-fluorescence could be selected for simply by varying the reaction time, at quantum efficiencies of 11% and 7%, respectively. The blue-fluorescent carbon dots were tested as dual-mode sensors for the detection of ferrous ion (Fe2+) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). They were shown to be selective to Fe2+ and H2O2 in solutions, with limits of detection of 21.9 and 0.7 mu M, respectively. The carbon dots were used to prepare paper-based sensors that can be used to determine Fe2+ and H2O2 concentrations as low as 30 mu M and 400 nM, respectively. Fe2+ and H2O2 in several real water samples were determined with excellent recovery and repeatability. They were also demonstrated to be luminescent in the polymeric materials, giving them a wide range of potential solid-state applications. In the tests of cell imaging, they were shown to have excellent biocompatibility, with cell viability of 90% at carbon dot concentrations of up to 1 g L-1. Our carbon dots are thus suitable for use as chemical and intracellular probes.

AB N-doped carbon dots (CDs) were synthesized simply and economically by a one-step hydrothermal method using starch as a carbon source and ethylenediamine (EDA) as a nitrogen dopant. The prepared CDs possess the properties of excitation-wavelength dependence and emit blue fluorescence under the excitation wavelength of 365 nm. CDs/starch composite was prepared to achieve the solid-state emission of CDs and their application in light emitting diode (LED) as fluorescent materials. White LED, with CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.37) and correlated color temperature of 5462 K, was obtained by combining CDs/starch and ultraviolet LED light source, indicating that starch-based CDs have the promising potential in the field of optoelectronic devices.

AB A series of lanthanide-doped Sr2YbF7 nanocrystals were prepared conveniently via a solvothermal method using oleic acid as the stabilizing agent, which were about 15 nm of the average crystalline size at 200 degrees C and 24 h. Through screening the doped lanthanide ions and their concentrations, we found that the nanocrystals realized intense ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared upconversion emissions under 980 nm excitation. Based on the photo-physical property of the nanocrystals, we built the hybrid Sr2YbF7: Tm3+@TiO2 to successfully realize upconversion-driven photo-degradation of Rhodamine B, in which semiconducting TiO2 took advantage of the light emitted by Sr2YbF7: Tm3+ to produce the electron-hole pairs.

AB A facile one-pot method to synthesis CuInS/ZnS (CIS/ZnS) QDs was developed. The prepared CIS/ZnS QDs exhibited a high bright emission. Moreover, the upconversion photoluminescence (PL) of the CIS/ZnS QDs was explored. Interestingly, extraordinary excitation-independent emission for both up and down conversion fluorescence of the CIS/ZnS QDs were observed. Analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) of CIS/ZnS QDs showed chalcopyrite crystal structure. The high-resolution transmission electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images demonstrated crystalline CIS/ZnS QDs with spherical shape and average diameter sizes of 2.5 nm and 3.6 nm for CIS core and CIS/ZnS QDs core shell, respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) suggested that the prepared CIS/ZnS QDs are polycrystalline with about 0.32 rim lattice distance. The PL peaks position was almost fixed and exhibited a strong peak at about 640 rim for both up and down conversion emission with a linear relationship between the intensity of the PL emission peaks and excitation wavelengths.

AB Europium doped lutetium oxide (Eu:Lu2O3) nanopowders were synthesized by a co-precipitation method using hydrogen carbonate (AHC) as a precipitant. Influence of the terminal pH value on properties of the Eu:Lu2O3 precursors and calcined powders was investigated. It is found that the terminal pH value has little influence on compositions of the precursors, and all the powders calcined at 1100 degrees C show good crystallinity. However, the terminal pH value has significant influence on morphology and agglomeration degree of both the precursors and the calcined powders. The powders are found to have the optimal dispersity with the average particle size of 68 nm when the terminal pH is 6.57. Using the nanopowders as starting materials, Eu:Lu2O3 transparent ceramics were fabricated by vacuum sintering at 1700 degrees C for 30 h. The ceramics prepared from the powders whose terminal pH is 6.57 were found to have the best transparency and the in-line transmittance reaches 68% at 611 nm. The influence of vacuum sintering temperatures on the microstructure and transmittance of the Eu:Lu2O3 transparent ceramics was also investigated. The Eu:Lu2O3 ceramics sintered at 1825 degrees C for 30 h show the highest in-line transmittance of 72% at 611 nm. The average grain size of the prepared Eu:Lu2O3 ceramics is about 454 pm and the light output of the sample is about 10 times higher than that of commercial BGO single crystal.

AB A Novel pyridine derivative 3-hydroxy 2-nitropyridine (3H2NP) was crystallized using slow evaporation solution growth technique (SEST). Single crystal XRD analysis was carried out to elucidate the structure of this organic material. 3H2NP was crystallized in a monoclinic crystal system with centrosymmetric space group P2(1)/c. The functional groups and its vibrational assignments were identified by FT-IR analysis. The UV spectrum specified that 3H2NP crystal had wide transparency in visible regions with lower cut off wavelength and optical band gap of 3.7 eV was obtained from Tauc's plot. The photoluminescence study confirmed the luminescence property and defect level present in the 3H2NP crystal. The mechanical hardness and the stability were evaluated by Vickers micro hardness test. The electronic properties, dielectric constant and dielectric loss of 3H2NP were recorded at room temperature for various frequencies. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the thermal stability of 3H2NP crystal and the melting point of the crystal was found to be 144 degrees C. The third order nonlinear optical properties of 3H2NP have been investigated by employing Z-scan technique. The title compound was computed using quantum mechanical calculations and the first order hyper polarizability value of 3H2NP was found to be 4.9 times that of the urea which settles NLO activity. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies showed that charge transfer occurred within the molecule.

AB We report on the mode tailoring of femtosecond laser written waveguides in LiNbO3 crystals by using multiscan technique. The effects of parameters of the laser writing, i.e., pulse energy and focusing depth, on the track formation are explored for multi-line waveguides with Type I modification. The mode profiles and guiding properties of the multi-line waveguides have been investigated in details at wavelength of 632.8 nm and 1550 nm. By adjusting the laser parameters to achieve desirable modal profiling, the multi-line waveguides can support modes at telecommunication band. Our results indicate the potential applications of the on-demand multi-line waveguides in LiNbO3 crystals as novel integrated photonic devices.

AB In recent days few-layered or ultrathin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) one of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is gaining serious attention for photovoltaics. TMD materials are able to absorb up to 5-10% of incident sunlight in less than 1 nm thickness to achieve an order of magnitude higher solar light absorption. Metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) was employed to obtain atomic layered MoS2 on SiO2/Si substrate which subsequently transferred on InP substrate using a simple transfer protocol. We realized photovoltaic operation in atomically few-layered MoS2 by forming a type II heterojunction with low dopped p-InP, instead of widely used p-Si. The built-in electric field arised due to interface between n-MoS2 and p-InP heterojunction is beneficial for the photogenerated carrier generation and separation. The solar cell device could achieve a power conversion efficiency of 0.11% with 1.87 mA/cm(2) current density, first attempt of TMD based solar cell on InP substrate, demonstrating a promising solar cell performance. The obtained results pave the way for the integration of TMD materials with the InP substrate to obtain efficient solar cells.

AB (Y(1-x)Ln(x))(2)O-3 oxides (Ln = Y, Gd, Lu) doped with Eu-3(+) ions are widely used as commercialized scintillators in medical and industrial scanning applications, with high performance and attractive properties. In this work, effects of high-energy radiation on luminescence properties of (Y1-xGdx)(2)O-3: Eu3+ powders with different particle sizes in the nanometric range are analyzed. Powders were prepared by polymer complex solution route, followed by annealing. Nanoparticles were obtained with an average size between 20 and 120 nm according to annealing conditions (time and temperature). Samples were exposed to gamma-irradiation (doses up to 4 MGy) on a commercial gamma-irradiation plant. The effect of irradiation on different nanoparticle size is followed by XRD, TEM and monitoring their luminescence properties. No change was observed in structure, morphology and steady-state emission. On the opposite after irradiation, excited-state lifetimes and quantum efficiency values are particle size dependent.

AB We present a theoretical study on the linear and nonlinear optical properties in AlrGa1-rAs/GaAs asymmetric multiple step quantum wells (AMSQW) under the effects of a non-resonant intense laser field (ILF), electric, and magnetic field. Calculations are for the linear optical absorption and refractive index relative changes combined with the second and third harmonic generation. The potential profile is constructed as a function of the Aluminum concentration, so that the heterostructure has four steps of different concentration, width and height. The energy levels and corresponding wavefunctions are obtained by solving the Schordinger equation, for an electron, in the envelope function approach, with parabolic bands, and the effective mass approximations. The results show that variations in ILF, electric field and magnetic field have significant influences on the magnitude and peak energy positions of the SHG and THG coefficients. Therefore, we can conclude that the effects of ILF, electric and magnetic fields can be used to tune and control the SHG and THG in the range of the terahertz electromagnetic spectrurn.

AB Near-ultraviolet (NUV)-excitable phosphors composed of Ba6-m-nEumMnnCa3YAlSi6O24 (m = 0.01-0.5, n = 0-0.5) were prepared via a solid-state reaction in a reducing atmosphere. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the single-phase orthosilicate Ba(6-m-n)Eu(m)Mn(n)Ca(3)YAlSi(6)O(24 )phosphors were examined to index the peak positions. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of the phosphors were clearly observed under 365-nm excitation. The critical distance and electric multipole interaction were exploited. The dependence of the luminescent intensity of the Mn2+ co-doped host lattice on the Eu(2+)content was also investigated. Co-doping Mn(2+)and Eu2+ emitters in the Ba(6-m-n)Eu(m)Mn(n)Ca(3)YAlSi(6)O(24 )phosphors enabled efficient energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ; the energy-transfer mechanism is also discussed. The Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates near the blue, white, and orange regions of the obtained phosphors were observed. Thermal quenching of Ba5.7Eu0.2Mn0.1Ca3YAlSi6O24 phosphor was exploited in the temperature range of 298-448 K and at 193 K. The activation energy for thermal quenching of the phosphors was calculated. The relative quantum efficiency (QE) of Ba5.7Eu0.2Mn0.Ca3YAlSi6O24 phosphor was compared with that of the commercial YAG:Ce and the previously studied Ba8.8Eu0.1Mn0.1Y2Si6O24 phosphor. NUV-executable white Ba5.7Eu0.2Mn0.1Ca3YAlSi6O24 phosphor with a 365-nm LED chip was fabricated and the internal QE was measured. The color rendering index (CRI, R-a) at correlated color temperature (CCT) with the CIE coordinates was exhibited for the LEDs.

AB Tb3+-doped high silica glass was prepared by sintering porous glass. The density, valence state and amount of Tb, transmittance, photoexcitation spectra, photoluminescence spectra, and cathodoluminescence spectra (CL) were recorded and the luminescence decay kinetics analyzed in details. These results show that the doping concentration in high silica glass is in direct proportion to the concentration in solution, and the density increases with the increasing concentration of rare earth ions as well as the intensity of emission spectrum. The largest emission intensity of 0.2 mol/L is more than 2 times higher than the intensity of the 0.05 mol/L. Besides, the "red" shift phenomenon could be distinguished clearly in the transmittance spectra. There is a broad band at the "red" region in the CL spectra. The decay time which is in the millisecond range in different spectral range were measured and analyzed revealing that the decay time of D-5(3) is shorter than that of D-5(4).

AB Sm3+-doped aluminoborate glasses containing Ag nanoparticles have been synthesized via a melt-quenching technique. After heat treatment, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption peak of Ag nanoparticles appears approximately at the wavelength lambda = 425 non. With the precipitation of the Ag nanoparticles, the intensities of visible (lambda = 600 nm) and near-infrared (lambda = 950 nm) photoluminescence are enhanced under excitation at lambda = 400 nm up to 39.8% and 25% that of the as-made glass, respectively. Moreover, the excitation of Sm3+ at lambda = 473 nm for the sample heat-treated at 500 degrees C shows higher enhancement in near-infrared photoluminescence by 55.5% (lambda = 950 nm). This enhancement is attributable to the intensified localized electromagnetic field accompanied by the excitation of SPR. The presence of Ag nanoparticles assists the conversion of UV light into visible and near-infrared light, which can induce a photoelectric effect for Si and other semiconductors used in solar cells.

AB This paper presents an experimental investigation of the performance of evacuated tube solar collectors integrated with Phase Change Materials systems. The performance of these systems depends on the thermal charging and discharging of the phase change materials. One of the important heat transfer parameters concerning these systems is the phase change process. Such a process depends on the flow rate of the heat transfer fluid and the environmental conditions. In the present study, a comparative study was carried out for two finned U-tube direct flow collectors. For the first collector paraffin wax was used as a phase change material. While for the second collector the control collector was left empty. Different flow rates were applied to study their effects on both the phase change process and the system performance. It was found that low flow rates allow a complete phase change and achieve the energy storage benefit of the phase change material. When the phase change process was complete, the system delivered its best efficiency. Under high flow rates, the system did not achieve the expected thermal energy storage benefits because the phase change material remained in the solid state. However, the solid phase provided a good insulator for the useful heat and enhanced the system's efficiency. At a flow rate that caused a partial phase change, the system's efficiency deteriorated, but the storage benefit of the phase change material was achieved. A novel correlation is proposed to estimate the hot water supply period according to a required discharge temperature. This correlation is valid for the direct flow finned and U-tube evacuated tube solar collectors integrated with paraffin wax as a phase change material.

AB A symmetric solid oxide fuel cell based on yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and PrBaMn2O5+delta (PBMO) electrode was developed by phase inversion and infiltration methods. Symmetric electrolyte support composed of two porous backbones and a thin dense layer were obtained by phase inversion and drop-coating techniques. PBMO catalysts were infiltrated into the finger-like pores of the backbone to serve as electrodes. Scanning electron microscopy results show that the cell has a porous symmetric structure with nanosized PBMO catalysts distributed in finger-like microchannels. With this symmetric structure, the anode polarization resistance for the cell decreased by 46% and the cathode polarization resistance decreased by 39% at 800 degrees C. The power outputs were improved by 100% in H-2 and CH4 fuel gas at 800 degrees C. These results imply that optimizing the microstructure of the electrolyte support is a promising approach to increase active surface areas and further improve the cell performance for SOFCs.

AB Most of the incident solar energy on a PV panel is converted into waste heat. This consequently reduces the efficiency of PV system. Therefore, if certain portion of this waste heat can be utilized adding a thermoelectric generator (TEG) in the PV panel endowed by an efficient cooling system, the output performance of the system can be improved significantly. In this study, a new configuration of nanofluid-based PV/T-TEG hybrid system with cooling channel is proposed to convert certain portion of waste heat to electrical energy in order to improve the overall efficiency of hybrid system. Thus, the nanofluid acts as a coolant and absorbs the heat from the back side of TEG module raising its gradient of temperature, as well as the overall performance of the system. Through a numerical modelling approach, performance of the proposed innovative design has been investigated and compared with the conventional solar-harvesting technology systems. At the optimum value of solar concentration C, and maximum operating temperature of 35 A degrees C, the obtained results reveal that the electrical energy in NCPV/T-TEG configuration has been found higher by 10%, 47.7% and 49.5% against NCPV/T, CPV and CPV/TEG-HS systems, respectively. Overall, the proposed design of NCPV/T-TEG hybrid system has potential for further development in high-concentration solar systems.

AB A new design of a solar chimney power plant (SCPP) with enhanced incident solar radiation, realised using reflectors, was developed and validated. A detailed thermodynamic analysis was performed to access the performance of the new SCPP design, and its performance was compared with a conventional SCPP. All the formulated energy and exergy balance equations were solved simultaneously using engineering equation solver software. Study reveals that the increase in incident solar radiation using reflectors enhances the efficiency and power output by 22.61% and 133%, respectively. The improvement in power output is due to the higher mass flow rate. Furthermore, a laboratory scale working model of an SCPP aided with reflectors was built to determine how well the empirical results agree with the results obtained using the analytical model developed in the present study. The model developed predicts the empirical values of temperature with an accuracy of 5%. The proposed model was evaluated in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia to be used as an illustrative example. For solar irradiation data of 2017, the average energetic efficiency and the power output for the SCPP design aided with reflectors are 0.641% and 230 kW, respectively. Moreover, the power output, energy efficiency, variation of the temperature of the floor and air, variation of the mass flow rate and inlet velocity of the turbine, and the density variation of air in the collector for each month of the year are reported. Also, the results of the comparative study with a conventional SCPP are presented.

AB The global development of the offshore renewable energy sector has been driven by extensive investment and research in the utilization of offshore renewable energies, mainly at the regional level. However, for mid to long-term marine energy development planning, a comprehensive assessment of the global potential for the exploitation of the main offshore resources is required. This work developed and implemented an innovative methodological approach to identify potential zones for wind and wave energy exploitation at the global level, using long-term data series with fine spatial and temporal resolution. The proposed methodology was based on a five-step approach comprised of: (i) a resource assessment, to identify the zones with favorable conditions for energy exploitation; (ii) a structural survivability assessment, to identify feasible areas which would likely ensure the integrity and durability of the wind and wave devices; (iii) a logistics assessment, to evaluate the possibility of carrying out installation, operations, and maintenance activities; (iv) an assessment of the distance to consumer centers, to estimate the feasibility of transmission to the main urban areas; and (v) an estimate of the extractable power of the identified potential zones. For wind power, the United Kingdom (with 1470 TWh/ month using a 10-MW turbine) and the United States (1079 TWh/month) were the countries with the highest estimated energy output of the identified potential zones. For wave energy, Brazil and New Zealand presented good opportunities for the development of the wave energy industry, with an estimated extractable power of 372 TWh/month and 286 TWh/month, respectively. The unique preliminary global analysis presented in this work provides guidelines to assist in the development of wave and offshore wind industries, in addition to supporting the management of marine spaces. Moreover, the methodologies can be replicated for other marine activities.

AB Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can be widely applied to directly convert thermal energy into electricity. Herein, we propose an energy management system for TEGs to achieve efficient energy storage and use. Specifically, we consider both the generally unstable power generation given the variable temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of TEGs and the variable load that requires the inclusion of a storage unit consisting of a battery and supercapacitor for improving the system performance. The supercapacitor mitigates energy fluctuations and reduces transients in the bus voltage, and the battery acts as a backup energy source, storing energy and delivering electricity when the load power demand is high. In addition, we propose a novel threshold control strategy based on the bus voltage intervals for the energy management system that incorporates maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and load power tracking (LPT) to maintain energy balance among the system units. MPPT aims to provide an efficient collection of thermal energy, and LPT based on fuzzy logic is used to maintain a stable bus voltage when the DC load power demand is low. The experimental results verify that the proposed LPT approach regulates the evaluated variations in DC load power with an average error of 3.5% and that the energy management properly operates under variable load power and battery state of charge.

AB Energy costs, carbon dioxide emissions, security of supply and system stability are common challenges in small islands. Many European islands have become pilot sites of energy innovation, but this green transition goes slowly in other ones usually not connected to the national grid. This study investigates the economic and environmental sustainability related to the integration of hydrogen and batteries storage in small islands, considering at the same time the use of the stored hydrogen for fuelling Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles and Hydrogen Compressed Natural Gas vehicles to meet electricity and public transportation demand of islands, so as to increase the Renewable Energy Sources penetration level. Selecting the island of Favignana (Italy) as case study, HOMER software has been used to carry out the energy analysis of different scenarios, in order to identify the most effective energy solution from both technological and economical point of views. Using economic and environmental indicators, the outcomes show that the implementation of a hybrid storage system with batteries and electrolyser can be an adequate and reliable option for increasing energy independency of small island and decarbonizing transport sector optimizing economic and environmental sustainability.

AB This paper presents a numerical study of a novel, multi-stage desiccant air conditioning system designed for moderate climates. The proposed system is based on multi-stage cooling process through the Maisotsenko Cycle (M-Cycle), regenerative heat and mass exchangers (pre-cooling and post-cooling) combined with a desiccant wheel. The performance of the system was analysed numerically with original epsilon-NTU models and it was compared with a typical solution based on a desiccant wheel and the Maisotsenko cycle. It was found that multi-stage system obtains lower supply airflow temperatures and higher moisture content decrease in desiccant wheel as compared to typical M-Cycle desiccant system. Moreover, this solution allows a decrease in the regeneration airflow temperature to 40 degrees C maintaining the same or lower supply airflow temperature in moderate climatic conditions. Using multi-stage cooling, the proposed system was able to attain a thermal COP (defined as amount of cooling capacity obtained by the unit divided by required heating capacity) of up to 4.0. Due to this performance the proposed system has high application potential in moderate climates.

AB Buildings are the significant primary energy consumption and pollutant emission contributors in a modern city. Distributed multi-generation systems such as combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) systems are considered an alternative to fulfil the energy saving requirements in the building sectors. In this study, a CCHP system primed with Maisotsenko combustion turbine cycle (MCTC) was considered with its performance compared with that primed with a simple gas turbine with recuperator (SGTR). With dynamic models of the CCHP systems constructed using TRNSYS, a design optimisation was conducted using genetic algorithm to determine the system component size and number based on the best year-round cost saving. A study case which consisted of building complexes in a district scale was used for investigation under two climatic conditions. The simulation results showed that the relative performances of both CCHP systems depended on the load profiles which differed from the situations when both prime movers were used solely for power generation. In a heating-dominated application, the performance of the MCTC-primed CCHP system was better than the SGTR-primed one only during the summer period and that the year-round performance was inferior to the latter one. Last but not the least, a parameter study was conducted which showed the benefit reduction of CCHP system with the decreasing of public grid price and increasing fuel gas price.

AB The flow performance of vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) is significantly deteriorated by dynamic stall at low tip-speed-ratios (TSR). Dynamic stall occurs periodically during the rotation of turbine blades and generates flow separations formed at leading-edges, which results in tremendous fluctuations in torque and essential reduction in power outputs. The target of this study is to apply a combination of CFD and Taguchi method to optimize the aerodynamic performance of a typical three-bladed VAWT at a low TSR of 2. Leading-edge wavy serrations and helical blade structures are implemented as the design parameters and the performance of these designs are compared with a corresponding baseline straight blade design of a traditional H-type VAWT. A comprehensive simulation study is carried out to obtain detailed flow characteristics. The Taguchi method is applied to find out the optimal combination of the selected factors such as amplitude and wave length of the serrations and twist angle of helical blade. A modified additive model is used to include the interaction effects among the selected factors. The optimal combination is found to appear in the case with an amplitude of 2.5%c(b) (c(b) is the blade chord length) and a wavelength of c(b)/6 for leading-edge serration as well as a blade twist angle of 60 degrees. The simulation results show that the flow separations and torque fluctuations are significantly suppressed due to the passive flow control strategies implemented in the optimized VAWT model. The power output of the optimized wind turbine is found to increase by 18.3% in comparison to the baseline model. In addition, the force fluctuations are observed to be significantly reduced by employing the helical design, which is beneficial for improving the lifespan of turbines. The results derived from this study indicate a better VAWT design for the rural and built environments with relatively insufficient wind energy.

AB Microgrids are a beneficial alternative to the conventional generation system that can provide greener, reliable and high quality power with reduced losses, and lower network congestion. However, the performance of renewable energy resource (RER) based generators in a microgrid is hindered by their intermittent nature. The energy storage system plays a key role in overcoming the intermittency of renewable sources by balancing the power demand against variable generation. Energy storage using batteries is accepted as one of the most important and efficient ways for retaining reliable energy supply whilst incorporating RERs into the electricity grid. Lead-acid (LA) batteries have been the most commonly used electrochemical energy storage technology for grid based applications till date, but many other competing technologies are also being used such as lithium-ion (Li ion), Sodium-Sulphur and flow batteries. This paper carries out the techno-economic analysis of the battery storage system under different configurations of the microgrid system. The design of an optimal model of standalone as well as grid-connected microgrid systems having PV-wind-diesel and biodiesel energy resources in the presence of Li-ion (LiFeSO4 type) and LA batteries have been studied. The performance of the two types of batteries has been compared in the proposed microgrid systems considering realistic load profiles, real resource data, and real prices of the components. Load profiles of two rural villages, a business organization and an urban residential building have been used. On the basis of these load profiles and available resources, different microgrid configurations with generation from PV, wind turbine, diesel and biodiesel generators have been considered to study the performances of the batteries. The results include the cost of optimal system configuration under the given scenarios, electricity generation by various generating sources, detail comparison between various components, emissions, and various batteries performance assessment parameters. The study reveals that Li-ion batteries as energy storage are techno-economically more viable compared to LA batteries and they are expected to play a significant role in various applications of future electric power systems.

AB Aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a small horizontal axis wind turbine are investigated experimentally and computationally. The purpose has been to develop a procedure to predict and optimize the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of such turbines. Aeroacoustic measurements are performed by an acoustic camera, while monitoring the plant's power output. In the computational analysis, an unsteady, 3D analysis is applied, modelling the turbulence by the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES), and the aeroacoustics by the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) approach. In the first part of the study, the original turbine blade is analyzed. A satisfactory agreement between the predictions and measurements is observed for the power conversion efficiency and the emitted sound. In the second part, the aerodynamics of the blade is optimized computationally, in the sense of a Quasi-3D approach, by a previously developed automated procedure. In this part, where a large number of 2D blade profiles are analyzed and optimized, a Reynolds Averaged Numerical Simulation approach is adopted for turbulence. In the third part, it is computationally verified (IDDES, FW-H) that the 3D blade, re-constructed based on the Quasi-3D optimization, exhibits a higher efficiency and lower sound emission. It is shown that the latter holds not only for the overall sound pressure, but also for the criteria pertaining to human perception of sound. Application of high-resolution methods with verification by on-site measurements, demonstration of the proposed Quasi-3D optimization procedure to lead to improved aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance are innovative aspects of the present investigation. The presented, validated procedure can be applied to predict and improve the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of small horizontal axis wind turbines.

AB Sustainable manufacturing, regarded as resource efficient, environment-friendly and customer satisfaction production, is major driving force for sustainable development. With growing demand for decoupling between resources and world economic development, accelerating sustainable manufacturing has become an important strategy. Therefore, a novel method based on emergy theory is proposed to perform the comprehensive evaluation and improvement of manufacturing systems. Firstly, drivers and challenges are analyzed, and the boundary and connotation of manufacturing systems are defined. Then, an emergy-based calculation model of the energy, material, service and waste is presented considering the variety and dimension of the input and output of manufacturing systems. The model expresses the mechanism of the transfer, coupling and conversion of the emergy for manufacturing systems. Besides, some indicator systems are established including functional emergy indicators, structural emergy indicators, eco-efficiency emergy indicators and sustainability indicators of manufacturing systems. The inner link between the economic, environment and social benefits of manufacturing systems is revealed through these indicators. On this basis, an improvement benchmarking card is developed to achieve the excellent quality, high efficiency, energy reduction, resource saving and environmental protection of manufacturing systems. Finally, a case study illustrates the practicability of the proposed method, and results show that the proposed method provides theoretical support for evaluating and improving the sustainability of manufacturing systems to coordinate the resources and development of the manufacturing industry.

AB The plate-type methanol steam reformer (MSR) designed for improving its reforming performance is integrated with proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) regarded as a hopeful miniature power source. This study then uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) through SIMPLE-C algorithm and Arrhenius form of reaction model to study the reforming performance of a plate-type MSR with the cylindrical cavities installed on the bottom of reformer channels. The influences of depth and diameter of cavities, and heated-wall temperature on reforming performance of reformer and estimated net power output of PEMFC have been examined with the same catalyst and inlet conditions in various flow channels of plate-type MSR. The results display that the installation of cylindrical cavities obviously improves the methanol conversion rate and hydrogen yield of a plate-type MSR. Compared with the traditional plate-type MSR, installing the cylindrical cavities of D-C = 1.4 mm and H-C = 1.5 mm on the plate-type MSR channels leads to the best enhancement in the methanol conversion rate by 22.65% and in the hydrogen yield by 64.52% at T-heater = 250 degrees C. Moreover, the novel plate type MSR with the cylindrical cavities of D-C = 1.4 mm and He = 1.5 mm acquires the best augmentation of 22.46% in the estimated net power output of PEMFC at T-heater = 250 degrees C.

AB The manuscript investigates aerodynamic performance of an airborne wind turbine with varying shell configurations in an effort to elaborate the influence of shell aerodynamics on the performance of the buoyant airborne wind turbine for operating conditions at an altitude of 400 m above the sea level. A systematic study has been conducted on the three airborne duct shapes based on the NACA-5415, NACA-9415 and NACA-5425 cambered aerofoils by considering NREL Phase IV rotor and constant airborne shell throat diameter of 4.02 m. Three dimensional steady state simulations have been performed by employing k-omega SST turbulence model for a range of wind speeds10-25 m/s at zero angle of attack (the angle between wind direction and turbine rotational axis). The performance of the studied turbines have been analysed in terms of rotor thrust coefficient, duct thrust coefficient, turbine power coefficient, swallowed mass flow rate and pressure distribution along the shell. Results demonstrate that among all the considered shell configurations, the NACA-9415 shell based turbine demonstrated highest power coefficient. Increment in the both, aerofoil camber (5-9% of chord length) and thickness (15-25% of the chord length) resulted in 2.05 and 1.45 times higher turbine power coefficient respectively in comparison to the reference aerofoil (NACA-5415) shell based turbine.

AB Currently, natural convection with nanofluid depends on the addition of nanoparticles with a high thermal conductivity to increase the heat transfer performance, often leading to limited increase in heat transfer rate and efficiency. Herein, a magnetically controlled heat transfer method was evaluated. This method enables a rectangular enclosure filled with Fe3O4@CNT nanofluid to achieve controllable heat exchange. Compared with conventional natural convective heat transfer, the magnetically controlled heat transfer method increased the thresholds of heat transfer efficiency by increasing the convective heat transfer. The heat transfer and flow of natural convection can be controlled by the strength and direction of magnetic field. The increase in heat transfer depends on the direction of magnetic field, and the strength of magnetic field determines the degree of heat transfer. This study provides a method to achieve superior convective heat transfer coefficients by controlling the magnetic nanoparticle distribution in a rectangular enclosure.

AB Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) allow CO2 capture and utilization for the electricity-driven bioproduction of organics such as acetic acid. Such systems can be coupled to any renewable electricity supply, especially those derived from solar and wind energy. However, fluctuations or even absence of electricity may cause damages or changes in the microbial community, and/or affect the performance and robustness of MES. Therefore, the transformation of gaseous CO2 into organic products in a MES was assessed continuously during 120 days of operation. Time-increasing power outages, from 4 h to 64 h, were applied in order to evaluate the effects of electric energy (current) absence on microbial community, organics formation, production rates and product accumulation. Acetic acid was the main product observed before and after the power outages. A maximum titer and production rate of 6965 mg L-1 and 516.2 mg L-1 d(-1) (35.8 g m(-2) d(-1)) of acetic acid were observed, respectively. During the absence of power supply, it was observed that acetic acid is oxidized back to CO2 which suggests microbial activity and/or pathway reversal. However, the electro-autotrophic activity recovered after the power gaps, and acetic acid production was restored after reconnecting the energy supply, reaching a current density of -25 A m(-2). The microbial community of the biofilm responsible for this behavior was characterized by means of high-throughput sequencing, revealing that Clostridium, Desulfovibrio and Sporomusa accounted for 93% of the total community attached onto the cathodic biofilm. Such resilience of electrotrophic microorganisms reinforces the opportunity to couple bioelectrochemical systems to renewable energy, overcoming the eventual electrical power fluctuations.

AB The Stirling thermocompressor (STCP), usually working at low frequency (< 5 Hz), is a novel Stirling -type external-combustion machine. It utilizes the temperature difference between the heating temperature and ambient temperature to generate the thermoacoustic power and pressure wave for refrigerators. In order to explore the characteristics of STCP, a detailed thermal analysis based on the third order 1-D finite volume model considering the real gas effect and variable physical properties was proceeded. Three natural fluids, helium, nitrogen and hydrogen are chosen as the working fluids and compared with each other. The parameter effects of pressure fluctuation under no-load operation were studied. To understand the output capacities for refrigerator with using different working fluids, the RC load method is adopt to analysis the STCP's capacity and efficiency of the conversion from heat energy to acoustic energy, also the loss characteristics under different working gas. When the working pressure, frequency and heating temperature are 4 MPa, 4 Hz and 800 K respectively, the STCP using helium as the working fluid could output about 380 W acoustic power for the RC load and relative Carnot efficiency is about 33%.

AB Thermoacoustic engines with a looped-tube structure and multiple thermoacoustic stages are able to efficiently utilize low-grade heat. If additional measures to counteract acoustic reflections are taken, similar results can be achieved by using only one single stage. The implementation of a stub, which is a compliant duct closed on one side and T-branched to the engine's loop on the other side, allows a precise tuning of acoustic conditions. By only changing position and length of the stub, phase difference and normalized impedance in the regenerator can be adjusted over a wide range. The method is experimentally validated by this paper. A test-rig is introduced that works with argon at atmospheric pressure. Measurements of thermal and acoustic conditions were conducted for several configurations of the stub. Afterwards, results are used to adjust a numerical DeltaEC-model. The proposed procedure employs simple and reasonable correction parameters. They take minor acoustic losses, nonlinear effects and geometrical errors into account. Eventually, the simulated acoustic field is in very good agreement with experimental results. The stub's acoustic tuning capability is verified. Further, the results show a large mismatch of thermal quantities. Gedeon streaming is expected to be responsible. It is later eliminated by use of a jet pump with a novel design. Hence, a major discrepancy is still observable being related to other effects of thermoacoustic streaming. Eventually, impacts of the jet pump to the acoustic field on system level are analyzed.

AB Herein the co-integration of two composite phase change materials into building envelopes and ventilation systems was first explored for reducing indoor temperature fluctuation. Specifically, a ternary mixture consisting CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O, NH4Cl and SrCl2 center dot 6H(2)O was combined with expanded perlite and expanded graphite to prepare two composites with different thermal conductivities, followed by fabricating them into two kinds of panels. A test room composed of a main room and a ventilation system was constructed, in which the expanded perlite-based composite panels were placed at the insides of the four walls, floor and roof of the main room, while the other expanded graphite-based composite ones were incorporated into the ventilation system. It is shown that the ternary mixture consisting of 95 wt% CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O-4 wt% NH4Cl-1 wt% SrCl2 center dot 6H(2)O exhibits a melting point of 23.46 degrees C, lower than that of CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O, making it more suitable for use in buildings. Its melting enthalpy is as high as 173.2 kJ/kg. The thermal conductivities of the expanded perlite- and expanded graphite-based composites have been measured to be 0.1170 and 9.720 W/(m.K), respectively. Compared with the room equipped with the expanded perlite-based composite panels at the envelopes, the one containing the two composite phase change panels at the envelopes and the ventilation system simultaneously exhibits a reduced indoor temperature fluctuation (22.29-28.69 degrees C) and a higher frequency of thermal comfort (78.3%). This work paves the way to the exploitation of hydrated salts as well as the applications of the phase change composites with different thermal conductivity in buildings envelopes and ventilation systems.

AB Catalytic methane decomposition (CMD) can pave the route for co-production of CO free hydrogen and valuable carbon materials, and it is considered as a potential promising strategy to develop eco-friendly and low-carbon hydrogen economy. However, there are still some challenges for utilization of traditional metal and/or carbon catalysts. In this work, relatively dispersed and efficient Ni/carbon catalysts were handily prepared for CMD by selective steam gasification of coal char with addition of nickel and/or cerium compositions. Carbothermal reduction during the gasification process could enable in-situ formation of Ni-0 crystallites and facilitate the gasification efficiency and thus achieving co-production of hydrogen-rich gas and Ni/carbon hybrids with large surface areas (217-265 m(2)/g). When the Ni/carbon hybrids as the selective gasification residues were used for CMD, high and stable methane conversion (up to about 90% at 850 degrees C) can be obtained in the 600-min CMD reaction, thanks to the relatively dispersed and active Ni-0 crystallites, large surface area of the porous carbon support and formation and growth of the fibrous carbon deposits.

AB Exergy and Exergoeconomic analysis are carried out for a new hydrogen and distilled water producing system. The presented cogeneration system is the combination of geothermal driven dual fluid organic Rankine cycle (ORC), proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and reverse osmosis (RO) desalination unit. In fact, hot geothermal water is the system input energy, which turns into power and runs the PEM electrolyzer and RO unit. Exergy analysis revealed that the ORC has the highest exergy destruction among the all main units and causes 59% of the total exergy destruction. Also, within the ORC, low pressure evaporator has the highest exergy destruction compared with other components. An increase in the geothermal water temperature resulted in a reduction in system overall exergy efficiency. Furthermore, exergoeconomic analysis showed that 56% of the total investment cost refers to the ORC. Based on the exergoeconomic analysis and considering the unit exergy cost of 1.3 $/GJ for geothermal hot water, produced hydrogen and distilled water have costs of 4.257 $/kg and 32.73 cent/m(3), respectively. Moreover, the annual payback period of 5.6 years indicates that the presented system can be of interest from the viewpoint of initial investment.

AB The fitting of empirical wind speed distributions is an important component in wind turbine energy yield assessment. Its accuracy depends on both the adequacy of the fitting function and the quality of the fitted wind speed data. Therefore, the system of wind speed distributions was recently introduced to further improve the statistical estimation of wind turbine energy yield. The system of wind speed distributions incorporates the three complement distributions Kappa, Wakeby and Burr-Generalized Extreme Value. In contrast to the progress that has been made in the statistical description of wind speed distributions, there is little research on the effects of poor quality data on the estimation of wind turbine energy yield. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the robustness of the system of wind speed distributions against typical wind speed data shortcomings such as (1) measurement errors, (2) missing data, and (3) low temporal resolution. The database were quality controlled wind speed time series from 187 measurement stations of the German Meteorological Service located in Germany with a 10-minute temporal resolution. The investigated time series cover the period from July 2016 to December 2017. The original wind speed time series were modified by (1) rounding them to 0.5 m/s and 1 m/s steps, (2) reducing data availability to 1.0% and 0.5%, (3) reducing the temporal resolution. Afterwards, the original and the modified wind speed time series were fitted to the system of wind speed distributions. Ten goodness-of-fit metrics were applied for comparison of the original wind speed distributions with the modified distributions fitted to the system of wind speed distributions. Overall, it was found that the system of wind speed distributions is robust against common quality issues in the wind speed time series. Applying a 2.5 MW wind turbine power curve and fitting the system of wind speed distributions to integer wind speed data, the mean percentage annual energy yield error was estimated at 3.3%. Fitting the system of wind speed distributions to wind speed data with very low data availability of 0.5% of the original data, the annual energy yield over all stations was underestimated at -8.2%. The results of this investigation will help adequately addressing the biases caused by poor quality wind speed data, and thus, help to improve wind turbine energy yield assessment.

AB The optimal sizing of the solar tower power plant with thermal energy storage is critical for increasing the system reliability and reducing the investment cost. However, the combined effects of key design parameters for sizing the solar tower power plants, including design direct normal irradiance, solar multiple and thermal storage hours, on the thermo-economic system performance under different solar resources are still unclear. In this study, a thermo-economic model for a 50 MW solar tower power plant based on steam Rankine cycle with molten salt storage has been developed to explore the optimal combinations of these parameters at four sites in China. The coupled relationship between these parameters and their effects on the annual electricity generation, solar-to-electricity efficiency and levelized cost of energy have been identified. The results show that the optimal design direct normal irradiance for minimal levelized cost of energy depends on both the annual irradiation level and the distribution of solar irradiance, which differs from the recommended values obtained from the traditional methods. It is found that the irradiation received by heliostats at the optimal design condition accounts for a specific percentage (Le., 72-75%) of the annual irradiation for the cases in this study. The sensitive analysis by varying the main financial parameters indicates that the optimal design direct normal irradiance and the corresponding percentage slightly vary with the heliostat cost. The results can provide a theoretical reference for determining the optimal size of the heliostat field and thermal energy storage for solar tower power systems under different solar resources.

The highest oil conversion was achieved using the catalyst with the Al2O3/Fe3O4 mass ratio of 0.5. It was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, DLS, FTIR, TPD, and VSM analysis. The XRD pattern was in agreement with the standard XRD pattern of cubic Fe3O4. The DLS analysis showed that the mean particle size of catalyst was around 193 nm. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 showed a broad peak at the temperature range of 400-450 degrees C, confirming the acidic sites on the surface of the catalyst. The VSM analysis confirmed that the catalyst saturation magnetization was high enough to be separated easily with a magnet. Response surface methodology was used to study the effects of time, temperature, and methanol/oil molar (M/O) ratio and their interactions on the oil conversion. According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), the effect of time and temperature was much more significant than that of M/O ratio. In addition, the interaction between time and temperature was more significant than the other interactions. The transesterification kinetics was investigated, and the results showed the rate constants ranging from 0.001 to 0.157 min(-1) and the activation energy of 55.48 kJ mol(-1). Thermodynamic studies demonstrated that the nature of the reaction was nonspontaneous (Delta G = 93.80 kJ mol(-1) at 373 K) and endergonic (Delta H = 54.08 kJ mol(-1)). The recovery of the catalyst was successfully performed at 400 degrees C, and the performance of the catalyst was acceptable after four cycles of recovery.

AB In this paper, a novel U-tube Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHX) with an oval cross-section is proposed for improving the performance of Ground Source Heat Pump systems (GSHP). To study the thermo-hydraulic performance of Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHX) with an oval U-tube: A three-dimensional, symmetric and unsteady state multi-physics Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations are carried out by ANSYS FLUENT environment. The conjugate heat transfer and fluid flow are simulated. Borehole thermal resistance, fluid inlet and outlet temperatures, fluid temperature profile along pipe length and pressure drop inside the tube are calculated and analyzed. The oval shape dimensions are adapted, then a comparison between the circle and the oval cross sections is carried out; four different cases are investigated. As a result, the CFD results show a good agreement with their experimental pairs via Thermal Response Test (TRT) test which was done during September 2017 by our laboratory members. Besides, the results show that the oval shape enhances the heat transfer process and achieves the lowest borehole thermal resistance of 0.125 m K/W, also, it decreases the thermal resistance by 18.47% compared with the circular one. Besides, the oval shape shows a pressure drop of 32% less than the circular tube. Consequently, the oval shape could enhance the coefficient of performance (COP) of GSHP, decrease the borehole length, decrease the operating pressure and cut down initial and operating costs. Also, it fit easily inside tight borehole, so it is preferable in high-densely urban areas.

AB The methanol synthesis from syngas obtained through pine biomass gasification was studied using Aspen Plus (R) simulation software. The gasification process was simulated using a thermodynamic equilibrium model which is based on the minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the system. A double chamber gasifier, which allows the separation of the gasification and combustion zones to obtain a high-quality gas, was considered. Furthermore, part of the char was burnt in the combustion chamber increasing the bed temperature and generating all the energy needed in the process. On the other hand, effect of the gasification temperature and the steam to biomass (S/B) mass ratio during the gasification process on the syngas composition, tar yield and methanol production were evaluated. In this sense, the H-2/CO ratio was calculated to stablish the best operating conditions for the production of methanol, being the best calculated operational condition of the process 900 degrees C and a S/B mass ratio of 0.9. In order to clean the syngas for the methanol synthesis and capture the greenhouse gases, a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process was considered. Furthermore, the influence of pressure and temperature on the methanol synthesis was researched to select the optimal conditions for methanol production. Finally, the methanol synthesis waste stream was recycled to the combustion chamber in order to analyse its effect on the process performance.

AB Carbon capture and storage is expected to play a pivotal role in achieving the emission reduction targets established by the Paris Agreement. However, the most mature technologies have been shown to reduce the net efficiency of fossil fuel-fired power plants by at least 7% points, increasing the electricity cost. Carbonate looping is a technology that may reduce these efficiency and economic penalties. Its maturity has increased significantly over the past twenty years, mostly due to development of novel process configurations and sorbents for improved process performance. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the calcium looping concepts and statistically evaluates their techno-economic feasibility. It has been shown that the most commonly reported figures for the efficiency penalty associated with calcium looping retrofits were between 6 and 8% points. Furthermore, the calcium-looping-based coal-fired power plants and sorption-enhanced hydrogen production systems integrated with combined cycles and/or fuel cells have been shown to achieve net efficiencies as high as 40% and 50-60%, respectively. Importantly, the performance of both retrofit and greenfield scenarios can be further improved by increasing the degree of heat integration, as well as using advanced power cycles and enhanced sorbents. The assessment of the economic feasibility of calcium looping concepts has indicated that the cost of carbon dioxide avoided will be between 10 and 30 (sic) per tonne of carbon dioxide and 10-50 (sic) per tonne of carbon dioxide in the retrofit and greenfield scenarios, respectively. However, limited economic data have been presented in the current literature for the thermodynamic performance of calcium looping concepts.

AB Kalian cycle is a modified Rankine cycle for power generation, that its working fluid is a mixture of ammonia water instead of pure water and can be driven in higher temperatures comparing to the Rankine cycle. In this study a hybrid Kalina power cycle and solar thermal flat plate collector using phase change material (PCM) as thermal energy storage material is introduced and analyzed. Bandar Aabas (a city in south of Iran), because of its sunny days and use of the Persian Gulf sea water for cooling in the condenser has been selected. The amount of solar fraction in year is 83.8%. This integrated process requires 53.85 GWh heat load during the year that 45.13 GWh of energy per year in the system, is supplied by the sun during the hours of 7-19 and released energy from the PCM during the night from 19.01 to 6.59. Rest of the needed heat load for the integrated system of 8.72 GWh per year is provided with auxiliary heater. By using energy and exergy balance equations, all components were analyzed. According to the results, thermal efficiency of the Kalina cycle is 6.12%. Results of the exergy analyses show 23.21% of the total destroyed exergy in the cycle, occurred in one of the heat exchangers as the main component wasting exergy. Also it was found that most the exergy efficiency is related to the one of the heat exchangers and flash separator with 99.24% and 99.11%, respectively.

AB Raw kaolinite mineral was modified by alkaline potassium hydroxide solution at 373.15 K for 8 h and calcinated at about 573.15 K to produce a new low cost and eco-friendly heterogeneous catalyst for efficient transformation of commercial waste cooking oil into biofuels (biodiesel). The synthetic catalyst was defined as K+-trapped kaolinite (Kaol/K+) and characterized by XRD, TEM, SEM, BET, and FT-IR in addition to the investigation of other properties as ion exchange capacity and total basicity. Different operating parameters were involved for the transesterification system for waste cooking oil in the presences of Kaol/K+ as a basic catalyst. 343.15 K temperature, 14:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 180 min conversion time, and 15 wt% catalyst loading were defined as the best conditions for maximum production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil with yield percentage of 94.76%. The basicity and catalytic activity of kaolinite/K+ enhanced greatly with increasing the concentration of KOH solution up to 30% and then decreased again with the studied higher concentrations (35% and 40%). The catalyst can be reused for five runs using distilled water, methanol and acetone as washing reagents with clear preferences for organic solvents. The properties of the produced biodiesel in this study match the requirements of ASTM D-6571 specification and EN 14214 specification as the international standards for biodiesel in the world.

AB With continuing of urbanization, improving of life quality as well as combating against air pollution, China is facing comprehensive challenges to supply modem clean heating to a majority of its citizens. For space heating solutions, currently in urban areas of north China, coal based district heating is prevalent. In urban areas of south China, distributed heating solutions are used. In rural areas, de-centralized coal stoves and biomass stoves are still commonly used. As renewable building heating solution, ground source heat pumps are installed for large scale applications. Building floor areas heated by ground source heat pumps increased tremendously during past ten years. Air source heat pump is being promoted in north Chinese rural areas as part of coal to clean heating project. Solar water heater and electric water heater for domestic hot water supply is widely used in north China and gas water boiler is widely used in south China. A series of policies have encouraged clean fossil fuel district heating in north China. National development plans are also supporting and subsidizing renewable heating technology such as heat pumps. Different building heating technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages from techno-economic and environmental perspectives. The choice of building heating solutions for different geolocations of China is strongly affected by spatial parameters such as local climate condition, population distribution, natural resource availability etc. Therefore, a spatial data analysis method is essential to help stakeholders decide proper building heating solutions in different parts of China by key performance indicators reflecting lower primary energy use, economic affordability and lower environmental impact.

AB A new point from modifying substrate structure of solar cells is proposed based on direct-contact phase-change immersion cooling to solve the heat dissipation problem of solar cells worked under high concentration ratios. An electric heating plate (EHP) is carefully designed to simulate the heat flux of solar cells under high concentration ratios (184.2 X). Easy and lower cost ways of electrochemical etching and mechanical drawing bench are adopted to modify substrate surface of simulated solar cells. The result of thermal measurement shows substrate, undergoing electrochemical etching for 2 h (CE-2) or mechanical drawing bench using 800 mesh (MDB-800), owns the lower wall average temperature (85.36 and 85.7 degrees C) and higher surface heat transfer coefficient (3008 and 2970 W/(m(2) K)). SEM results reveal that CE-2 or MDB-800 has uniform-distributed porous or dense-grooved structure. These special structures show better surface wettability and provide more active nucleus sites for small bubbles generation as well as higher bubbles update frequency according to our modified surface wettability and quantitative analysis results. Our study reveals that the advanced heat transfer performance is attributed to substrate structure with uniform-distributed porous or dense-grooved of CE-2 or MDB-800. This work gives a theoretical guidance for heat transfer advancement investigation involved in surface characteristic.

The discretized governing equations of the model were numerically solved on a non-uniform grid with an in-house developed code. The simulation was performed for velocity, pressure, concentration of species, and liquid water saturation in the anode side of the PEMFC. At first, the steady-state and transient effects of introducing the CO-contaminated hydrogen on the cell performance were investigated. Then, a comprehensive investigation of the commonly used mitigation techniques including the effect of air or oxygen bleeding, elevation of temperature and the effect of using CO-tolerant catalysts (PtRu/C), was conducted. The numerical results of the model were compared and validated with the experimental data. The results indicated that even using a low CO concentration, leads to significant degradation of the fuel cell output current density (about 30% of the output current was lost within 30 min when the hydrogen is pre-mixed with 15 ppm of CO as the fuel). Injecting a small amount of air into the anode stream, resulted in fast recovery of the lost current density (by injecting about 5% air into the fuel, 80% of the output current was recovered within 2 min at 53 ppm CO). Higher air bleeding ratio only resulted in minor improvement of the cell performance. Increasing the cell temperature; also using PtRu/C instead of Pt/C (at low temperatures) led to improving the cell performance. The use of PtRu/C at a high operating temperatures only resulted in minor improvement of the cell performance.

AB Hybrid renewable energy heat sources provide more sustainable energy resources with high maintenance for high-efficient power plants. Multigeneration systems driven by a hybrid renewable source are proved as cutting-edge technologies in recent studies. In this study, a novel multigeneration system driven by a hybrid biogasgeothermal heat source is proposed and simulated. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed multi generation system, first and second laws analysis are employed as the most effective tools for performance assessment of the systems. It is found that the proposed multigeneration system can produce overall heating capacity, overall cooling capacity, net output power, hydrogen production rate, and freshwater production rate of 538.1 kW, 1799 kW, 443.4 kW, 0.2583 kg/s, and 367.92 lit/h, respectively. Under this circumstance, the thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, and total exergy destruction of the system are calculated 62.28%, 74.9%, and 2036.19 kW, respectively, showing a considerable improvement compared to the single-generation system. In addition, the results indicated that the condenser is the most destructive component, whereas the absorption refrigeration cycle is accounted as the most destructive sub-system. Moreover, a comprehensive parametric study is carried out to give more information about the behavior of the proposed system.

AB Traditionally, only one set voltage monitor was used for fuel cell diagnosis and bipolar plate was regarded as the equipotential body. This study presents a novel analysis about this classic method, and proves that only one-set voltage monitor cannot obtain the real health status of every cell. Experimental results point out that the voltage of each cell along the cell gas channel is variable. The current and voltage redistribution phenomenon, caused by the cell interaction, was observed in the fuel cell stack with graphite bipolar plate. Thus, a one-dimensional model has been proposed to explain the mechanism of the current and voltage redistribution with cell interaction. Simulation result shows that, as long as the abnormal cell exists, the current and voltage distribution of the whole stack is significantly affected. Finally, a multipoint voltage-monitoring method has been developed for fuel cell consistency analysis. New method was applied in a specially designed four-cell stack to validate the model analysis. Additionally, the proposed method was used to diagnose anode starvation, which cannot be easily detected using only the one-set voltage monitor for the anode inlet. All experiments and modeling works prove that the multipoint voltage-monitoring method is effective for fuel cell consistency analysis.

AB Efficient utilization of biomass and garbage has attracted sharp attention in the context of the energy crisis. Fast catalytic pyrolysis (CFP) of chlorella vulgaris (CV), kitchen waste (KW) and their blends was carried out in this study in order to dispose garbage and develop alternative energy simultaneously. Catalysts of CaCO3, CaO, SiO2 and permutit were considered. Five CV blending degrees of 100, 80, 50, 20 and 0 wt% were studied. Influences of CV to KW ratios and catalyst types on pyrolysis products were primarily studied by thermogravimetric analyzer coupled to Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (TGA-FTTR) and Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). TGA-FTIR results showed that the decomposition behavior and the thermal gas release have been advanced after blending, especially at the ratio of 5:5, which indicated that co-pyrolysis promoted the main pyrolysis stage. For the co-pyrolysis of 50% CV with 50% KW, the apparent activation energy decreased by 14.9-19.3% compared to sole CV pyrolysis, 25.8-28.2% compared to sole KW pyrolysis. Regarding thermogravimetric characterization of samples with different additives, permutit possessed the most predominant promoting effect by lowering the initial temperature, increasing main stage mass loss and resulting in less residue mass. Py-GC/MS results demonstrated that CaO had the best positive effect among the four additives. It improved pyrolysis products by reducing acids by 85.9% for CV, 70.2% for KW and 81.7% for 5CV5KW, as well as increasing hydrocarbons to some extent. In summary, CFP of the sample at a blending ratio of 50% CV with 50% KW in the presence of CaO, could be a desirable treatment before further processing step of pyrolysis products.

AB In order to overcome the rotational speed oscillation under no-load start-up condition caused by the 'S' characteristic area of the pump-turbine and the difficulty in improving the dynamic process under low head area of pumped storage unit (PSU), this paper uses the model predictive control and fuzzy logic control theory to study the optimal control of PSU under no-load start-up condition at low head area. Firstly, the instantaneous linearized controlled autoregressive integrated moving average model (CARIMA) of PSU is proposed. This model contains the dynamic equations of the complex pipeline system and pump-turbine generator-motor that accurately describe the hydraulic and mechanical dynamic characteristics. Based on the CARIMA, a novel adaptive condition predictive-fuzzy PID (ACP-FPID) controller is designed. The controller contains the operating point prediction and the avoidance of critical curves of the 'S' characteristic area. Then, multi-objective optimization control method combined with bacterial foraging algorithm is utilized for the optimal parameters selection of controller, guide opening time and frequency switching point when the closed-loop controller is put into operation. Furthermore, numerical simulation tests under start-up condition in typically low head are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the ACP-FPID optimal control method. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively avoid the deep running of the unit into the 'S' characteristic area compared with traditional ones. The approximate periodic oscillations times and overshoot index of rotational speed obtained by ACP-FPID are less than 1 and 2% respectively, which are much smaller than that values obtained by the traditional ones. Moreover, strong robustness of ACP-FPID is testified when PSU disturbed by mechanical factors.

AB This study compared the energy performance and initial cost of photovoltaic (PV) and heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment for a residential net-zero energy building (NZEB) in different climate zones across the United States. We used an experimentally validated building simulation model to evaluate various electrically-powered and commercially-available HVAC technologies. The HVAC accounted for 23.8% to 72.9% of the total building energy depending on the HVAC option and climate zone. Each HVAC configuration was paired with a PV system sized to exactly reach the net-zero energy target, so the economics were compared based on the initial PV + HVAC cost. Mechanical ventilation was considered with and without heat recovery; the heat recovery ventilator (HRV) saved a significant amount of energy in cold winter months and hot summer months, and the energy recovery ventilator (ERV) provided additional benefit for humid zones. The HRV was cost-effective in the cold northern latitudes of Chicago, Minneapolis, Helena, and Duluth, where energy savings reached 17.3% to 19.7%. In other climates, ventilation without recovery was more cost effective, by 1% to 9%, and sometimes even more energy efficient. The ERV was never the lowest cost option. A ground-source heat pump (GSHP) and an air-source heat pump (ASHP) were compared, with the GSHP providing significant energy savings, 24.3% to 39.2%, in heating-dominated climates (Chicago through Duluth). In warmer climates, the GSHP saved little energy or used more energy than the ASHP. The PV + HVAC cost was lower everywhere with the ASHP, though it is possible for colder climates that a carefully sized GSHP and ground loop could be cost competitive. The energy and cost data as well as the required PV capacity could guide HVAC and PV designs for residential NZEBs in different climate zones.

AB The continued production of waste is creating management problems. The use of traditional waste management methods, such as incineration and landfill, releases gases that may cause global warming. Energy demand is also increasing rapidly owing to the rapid increase in population and industrialization. To meet this ever-increasing demand, access to clean and green energy is essential for the sustainable development of human society. These two challenges, if managed scientifically using biowaste to bioenergy (BtB) technology, can provide solutions for one another. In this article, we reviewed the strategies for and status of BtB technology (anaerobic digestion, transesterification, and microbial fuel cells) used to convert various biowastes (forest and agriculture residue, animal wastes, and municipal wastes) into bioenergy (biogas, biodiesel, bioalcohol, and bioelectricity). The participation of researchers, scientists, government agencies, and stakeholders is needed to increase the feasibility of these technologies.

Comparative analyses are made among the conventional cogeneration heating system, the absorption heat pump cogeneration heating system, the high backpressure cogeneration heating system and the novel cogeneration heating system from the aspects of thermodynamics, energy consumption and economy. The research objects are 2 x 300 MW water-cooling turbine units. The aim of the work is to point out the optimization direction of system integration for the novel cogeneration heating system by the thermodynamic analysis, and to reveal the actual heating energy consumption and the unit heating cost of the systems based on the method of equivalent electricity of heating. The study results show that the novel cogeneration heating system reasonably matches the extraction steam, the exhaust steam and the heating network water with each other at different energy levels. Therefore, it has evident advantages in the aspects of the thermodynamic perfection, the actual heating energy consumption and the economy. Compared with other systems, the novel cogeneration heating system increases the total exergy efficiency by 6.1-14.1%, reduces the equivalent electricity of heating by 11.1-29.4% and reduces the unit heating cost by 8.7-23.9%.

AB Electricity generation via renewable energy systems can be fed into the electrical grid when it is needed or stored when it is excessive. This is important for demand management. In this regard, power to gas technology (PTG) is recognized as a potential option for an efficiently, environmentally friendly and long-term storage solution for renewable energy systems. An integrated wind power system comprised of wind turbine, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and a methanation unit is considered in this study for thermodynamic analyses. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the overall developed system are found to be 44% and 45%, respectively. The methanation unit works based on the Sabatier reaction for synthetic natural gas (SNG) production. A steam perm-selective membrane is considered for methanation and the products are integrated with other parts of the system for heat recovery. An increase in the wind speed results in a decrease in the exergetic efficiency and an increase in hydrogen and methane production. Hence, multi-objective optimization method based on genetic algorithm is employed to determine the optimal values for the decision variables. The exergetic efficiency of the overall system is 41%, and hence, the CH4 production by the present system is 1.68 kg/h which are found to be the optimal values where the wind velocity is 4.33 m/s, and the power coefficient becomes 0.57, respectively.

AB With the continuous consumption of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, the environmental energy problem has become the focus of attention in the world. The utilization of clean and non-polluting solar energy for photovoltaic (PV) power generation can effectively utilize renewable energy. However, the instability of weather condition makes the output of PV power have strong randomness, fluctuations and intermittence. Therefore, reliable PV power prediction method can reduce the disadvantages of PV power generation, which is of great significance to maintenance and repair of power plants. In the study, a novel hybrid prediction model combining improved K-means clustering, grey relational analysis (GRA) and Elman neural network (Hybrid improved Kmeans-GRA-Elman, HKGE) for short-term PV power prediction is proposed. The proposed model is established by using multivariate meteorological factors and historical power datasets for two years. The improved K-means approach is applied to cluster the historical power datasets, and combining the GRA method to determine the similarity days and the optimal similarity day of the forecasting day. The Elman neural network model is employed to better develop the nonlinear relationship between multivariate meteorological factors and power data. Compared with the other eight prediction methods, the results show that the proposed method has an outstanding performance on improving the prediction accuracy.

AB The goal of this paper is to study and evaluate the thermodynamic and the thermo-economic performance of dual-pressure and single pressure evaporation organic Rankine cycle (DORC and SORC) using isobutane as the working fluid. The effects of the two-stage pressures and the heat source inlet temperature on the system performances have been investigated. Then the performance comparisons between SORC and DORC have been conducted at the optimized condition. Results show that the DORC yields more net power than the SORC when the heat source temperature is between 100 and 177.2 degrees C, and the net power output gains of the DORC are higher at lower heat source temperature. The DORC no longer has the performance advantage as the heat source temperature is above 177.2 degrees C. The thermo-economic evaluations show that the optimized electricity production cost (EPC) decreases as the heat source temperature rises. Furthermore, optimized EPC of SORC and DORC are nearly equal at the same heat source temperature. For the heat source temperature of 100-177.2 degrees C, the DORC can significantly increase the net power output, but the thermo-economic performance of DORC is not reduced by system complexity compared to the SORC.

AB As dairy consumption grows, domestic dairy farms face challenges in reducing the cost of feeds and the production of high-quality milk for market demands. This paper aims to introduce and integrate solar energy into the milk production chain to investigate its economic performance. By collecting data on milk production processes from 11 dairy farms in China, we quantified electricity usage and costs of milk production to identify the best and worst cases. Crop yields response to the water demand and the electricity requirements of the dairy farms were considered. The study simulated scenarios of self-sufficiency at 20%, 80%, and 100%, in the identified farms by integrating a photovoltaic water pumping (PVWP) system to provide both power and water for alfalfa and other feeds' irrigation and subsequent milk production. We evaluated annual discounted cost, revenue and net profit under each scenario and case. The results showed that a dairy farm with an integrated PVWP system and self-sufficient feeds would lead to value add-ins, such as electricity saving with solar energy generation, economic cost saving of crops, and CO2 emission reduction. The analysis on return on investment (ROI) and internal rate of return (IRR) revealed that not all the self-sufficient feeds can bring positive marginal profit. Among the investigated scenarios and cases, the dairy farm marked out by the highest ROI with 3.12 and IRR with 20.4%, was the farm where the integrated PVWP system was used to reach 20% self-sufficiency (self-production of only alfalfa). The other scenarios and cases with higher levels of self-sufficiency showed lower ROIs and IRRs. This indicates that high self-production levels of feeds decrease the total profit due to high investment cost. Sensitivity analyses of crop price and operational cost were conducted for ROI with single and double factor approaches. Scale and production of feeds proportions should be carefully considered in improving the economic performance of dairy milk production.

AB This study aims to investigate the effects of nascent char in pyrolysis process on the product distribution from ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (UT) of biomass. Fast pyrolysis of wheat straw without HZSM-5 as well as with insufficient/sufficient HZSM-5 were performed with controlled extents of volatile-char interaction in a two-stage fluidized-bed/fixed-bed combination reactor. The results show that nascent char has the catalytic ability to promote the secondary cracking of pyrolysis vapors and the secondary formation of solid organics. The carbon yield of olefins + aromatics increased from 12.33% to 14.70% and then decreased to 12.68% with intensified volatile-char interaction when HZSM-5 was insufficient. The initial increase can be explained by the higher conversion efficiency of residual light compounds for HZSM-5 catalysis after volatile-char interaction. Nascent char was observed to have negative effects on the production of aromatics and olefins when HZSM-5 was sufficient. However, with a slight decrease (by 2.04%) in the carbon yield of olefins + aromatics at the beginning of char accumulation, coke carbon yield significantly decreased by 15.88%. CFP of raw and acid-washed wheat straw over insufficient HZSM-5 with controlled extents of volatile-char interaction were further compared. It is demonstrated that the inorganic minerals in raw biomass play as the active components of nascent char in volatile-char interaction.

AB Due to the increasingly serious shortage of resources, new energy-using technologies and new energy sources have received widespread social attention. CCHP system, as an efficient and stable way of energy utilization, has wide application prospect, which can achieve energy ladder utilization and multi-energy complementary. In this study, a correlation model for configuration and operation optimization based on a bi-level model construction method is established for a CCHP coupled multi-energy system. A solution method based on sequence control configuration methods, sequential quadratic programming algorithm and feedback correction mechanism is proposed for the optimization model and a CCHP coupling multi-energy system optimization tool is developed using MATLAB. Then taking a commercial area in Tianjin as a specific case, after calculating, the optimized system has significant economic benefit, whose total annual operating cost can be reduced by 36.2% compared with the traditional sub-system. The study found an effective method for the design optimization of CCHP coupled multi-energy system, and gives a new idea for solving similar optimization problems.

AB Thermal energy storage can provide cost-effective benefits for different commercial fields because it allows heat recycling for use, such as in concentrated solar power plants or metallurgical and steel plants. Compared to traditional sensible and latent energy storage, thermochemical energy storage (TCES) offers a greater possibility for stable and efficient energy generation owing to high energy storage densities, long-term storage without heat loss, etc. The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive insight into the current state of the art of research on several typical TCES systems at high operation temperatures (673-1273 K). These systems include hydride, metal oxide and organic systems. Each system is discussed in regard to two aspects: cycle life and heat storage performance. A concrete analysis of the current research and development provided in this review exposes that the main challenges of the aforementioned TCES systems rely on robust cycling stability of materials, reliable energy charging and discharging reactors, and a high-efficiency system for widespread commercialization. To bring the TCES system to market, more intensive studies about enhancement of cycle life from micro perspective, charging-discharging behavior in the reactors and development of system integration are still required.

AB Attackers leverage various obfuscation techniques to create a metamorphic malware that can evade from detection by anti-malwares. To defeat, we propose Graph Mining for Metamorphic Malware Detection (G3MD), an intelligent system for static detection of metamorphic malwares. G3MD demonstrates one of the many aspects of what the current generation of machine-learning techniques and expert systems can do. It extends what is known about practical application of machine-learning techniques in the field of information security. It is intended to alleviate the burden of human experts and underlying costs. The novelty of G3MD is to apply graph mining on the opcode graphs of a metamorphic family of malwares to extract the frequent sub-graphs, so called micro signatures. Based on these sub-graphs, a classifier is trained to distinguish between a benign file and a metamorphic malware. We conducted experiments on four families of metamorphic malwares common in previous studies, namely Next Generation Virus Generation Kit (NGVCK), Second Generation Virus Generator (G2), and Mass Produced Code Generation Kit (MPCGEN) viruses and Metamorphic Worm (MWOR) worms. The precision (over 99% in most cases) of metamorphic malware detection by the proposed approach corroborates its effectiveness over other existing approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emotion is an intense mental experience often manifested by rapid heartbeat, breathing, sweating, and facial expressions. Emotion recognition from these physiological signals is a challenging problem with interesting applications such as developing wearable assistive devices and smart human-computer interfaces. This paper presents an automated method for emotion classification in children using electro-dermal activity (EDA) signals. The time-frequency analysis of the acquired raw EDAs provides a feature space based on which different emotions can be recognized. To this end, the complex Morlet (C-Morlet) wavelet function is applied on the recorded EDA signals. The dataset used in this paper includes a set of multimodal recordings of social and communicative behavior as well as EDA recordings of 100 children younger than 30 months old. The dataset is annotated by two experts to extract the time sequence corresponding to three main emotions including "Joy", "Boredom", and "Acceptance". The annotation process is performed considering the synchronicity between the children's facial expressions and the EDA time sequences. Various experiments are conducted on the annotated EDA signals to classify emotions using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The quantitative results show that the emotion classification performance remarkably improves compared to other methods when the proposed wavelet-based features are used. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Predictive business process monitoring methods use datasets of completed cases related to a process to predict the behaviour of running cases. To handle the large amounts of available event data, recent works have turned to deep learning techniques and have achieved fairly accurate results. However, results from these techniques are often difficult to interpret and explain. In the area of Recommender systems, factorization models have been an important class of predictive techniques due to its scalability and ability to infer latent features. Motivated by research in Recommender systems, this paper presents a predictive model that combines matrix factorization techniques from Recommender systems and knowledge from Business Process Management to learn interactions between latent features that can be used to predict the next event of an ongoing case. Evaluation on two real-life datasets from a Dutch Financial Institute and Volvo IT Belgium shows that the approach yields results that are comparable and at times superior to state-of-the-art techniques such as neural networks, yielding at most a precision of 0.87 for next event predictions.

AB We propose an intelligent system to detect human fall events using a physics-based myoskeletal simulation, detecting falls by comparing the simulation with a fall velocity profile using the Hausdorff distance. Previous methods of fall detection are trained using recordings of acted falls which are limited in number, body variability and type of fall and can be unrepresentative of real falls. The paper demonstrates that the use of fall recordings are unnecessary for modelling the fall as the simulation engine can produce a variety of fall events customised to an individual's physical characteristics using myoskeletal models of different morphology, without pre-knowledge of the falling behaviour. To validate this methodological approach, the simulation is customised by the person's height, modelling a rigid fall type. This approach allows the detection to be tailored to cohorts in the population (such as the elderly or the infirm) that are not represented in existing fall datasets. The method has been evaluated on several publicly available datasets which show that our method outperforms the results of previously reported research in fall detection. Finally, our approach is demonstrated to be robust to occlusions that hide up to 50% of a fall, which increases the applicability of automatic fall detection in a real-world environment such as the home.

AB To assess the current mental state of an individual, several monitoring systems have been developed. In this paper, we explore the possibility to exploit information recorded noninvasively from the human cortex to develop a brain-computer interface (BCI) able to estimate brain workload and the mental efforts during a cognitive task. The EEG-based workload classifier presented in this paper combines a power spectral density (PSD) analysis and a statistical criterion. The proposed classifier is applied in the context of distance education and online course platform through two experimental protocols. The first one proposes solving a set of matrices products using pen and paper, while the second one proposes answering problems of logic mathematics on a computer-based learning environment. Experimental results show that the averaged accuracy of distinguishing changes in the theta [4-7Hz] (theta) band is 79%. For the alpha band [8-11 Hz] (alpha) the averaged accuracy reached 78%. Based on this classifier, we demonstrate that and theta powers in central, and posterior sites decrease with the increase in difficulty level of the cognitive task. The accuracy of correct decisions obtained from our results are significantly enhanced while comparing our investigation to some similar works from literature. In the realm of intelligent expert systems, our work results represent a first step to an implementation of an intelligent system for the evaluation of reeducative therapies to be used in physiotherapy centers for children with cognitive disorders as it is the case for Cerebral Palsy.

AB The success of e-commerce firms is highly dependent on the increasing number of customer reviews. However, to gain profit or fame, people may try to challenge the system by writing deceptive reviews that unjustly promote and/or demote target products or services. In this paper, a unified unsupervised framework is proposed to address the problem of opinion spamming. The rationale is that although not all outlier reviews are spam, spammers usually exhibit abnormities and deviations from normal users on certain dimensions concerning the same or even many products, thereby increasing their corresponding degrees of spamming (called "spamicity" in this paper). We introduce a set of abnormity signals from a review deviation angle and also present in detail an aspect-based review deviation dimension to model latent content deviation. Afterwards, a joint review deviation divergence is computed and ranked for detecting final opinion reviewer spamicity. Results of experiments conducted on a real-life Amazon review dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The retinal vascular condition is a reliable biomarker of several ophthalmologic and cardiovascular diseases, so automatic vessel segmentation may be crucial to diagnose and monitor them. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines the multiscale analysis provided by the Stationary Wavelet Transform with a multiscale Fully Convolutional Neural Network to cope with the varying width and direction of the vessel structure in the retina. Our proposal uses rotation operations as the basis of a joint strategy for both data augmentation and prediction, which allows us to explore the information learned during training to refine the segmentation. The method was evaluated on three publicly available databases, achieving an average accuracy of 0.9576, 0.9694, and 0.9653, and average area under the ROC curve of 0.9821, 0.9905, and 0.9855 on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 databases, respectively. It also appears to be robust to the training set and to the inter-rater variability, which shows its potential for real-world applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the ubiquity of the Internet, platforms such as: Google, Wikipedia and the like can provide insights pertaining to firms' financial performance as well as capture the collective interest of traders through search trends, number of web page visitors and/or financial news sentiment. Information emanating from these platforms can significantly affect, or be affected by, changes in the stock market. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop a financial expert system that incorporates these features to predict short term stock prices. Our expert system is comprised of two main modules: a knowledge base and an artificial intelligence (AI) platform. The "knowledge base" for our expert system captures: (a) historical stock prices; (b) several well-known technical indicators; (c) counts and sentiment scores of published news articles for a given stock; (d) trends in Google searches for the given stock ticker; and (e) number of unique visitors for pertinent Wikipedia pages. Once the data is collected, we use a structured approach for data preparation. Then, the AI platform trains four machine learning ensemble methods: (a) a neural network regression ensemble; (b) a support vector regression ensemble; (c) a boosted regression tree; and (d) a random forest regression. In the cross-validation phase, the AI platform picks the "best" ensemble for a given stock. To evaluate the efficacy of our expert system, we first present a case study based on the Citi Group stock ($C) with data collected from 01/01/2013 - 12/31/2016. We show the expert system can predict the 1-day ahead $C stock price with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) <= 1.50% and the 1-10 day ahead with a MAPE <= 1.89%, which is better than the reported results in the literature. We show that the use of features extracted from online sources does not substitute the traditional financial metrics, but rather supplements them to improve upon the prediction performance of machine learning based methods. To highlight the utility and generalizability of our expert system, we predict the 1-day ahead price of 19 additional stocks from different industries, volatilities and growth patterns. We report an overall mean for the MAPE statistic of 1.07% across our five different machine learning models, including a MAPE of under 0.75% for 18 of the 19 stocks for the best ensemble (boosted regression tree).

AB Accurate Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image segmentation is a clinically challenging task. More often than not, one type of MRI image is insufficient to provide the complete information about a pathological tissue or a visual object from the image. As a result, radiology experts often combine multisequence images of a patient to verify the location, extension, prognosis and diagnosis of an object. There are mainly two challenges in medical image segmentation. One is ambiguous boundary that appears between an object and its neighboring region, and the other is intensity inhomogeneity that appears within a region. Thus, this paper focuses on how to effectively segment multisequence medical images despite these two main challenges. This paper proposes a multi-phase approach that integrates both data and domain knowledge into multisequence MR image segmentation. This study divides the segmentation approach into three phases, which are (i) information modeling, (ii), information fusion, and (iii) visual object extraction. In the first phase, random walks algorithm is modified and used to model the information of an image. Because of the ambiguous boundary and intensity inhomogeneity that appear within an image, extra terms related to homogeneity- and object feature-based components are added into the weighting function of random walks algorithm. In the second phase, weighted averaging method is used to fuse information from the image sequences. Both data information of an image as well as user knowledge are integrated to determine the weights of each sequence for fusion. In the final phase, the concept of information theoretic rough sets (ITRS) is utilized to address the issue of ambiguous boundary that may appear between the visual object and its background for object extraction. The proposed approach is tested on MICCAI brain tumor dataset to extract brain tumor and its performance is compared with other established methods. The experiments show promising results, with an average DICE accuracy of 0.7 and 0.63 for high- and low-grade tumor, respectively. As compared to the other fully- and semi-automatic methods that require training and careful initialization processes, the proposed approach is able to extract the brain tumor with prior knowledge about the image.

AB This paper addresses the problem of elaborating travel itineraries considering the visitors profiles, travel distances and costs. Other parameters such as how much the tourists value the attractions offered are particularly taken into account, as well as their preferences regarding the order of visiting these attractions. This problem can be seen as a traveling salesman problem with profits that also considers priority prizes. It is described by an optimization model based on mixed integer programming, which aims to generate itineraries that maximize the total value of the attractions visited and minimize the total travel cost involved. We present results for sets of instances based on randomly generated and real data by applying mathematical programming techniques and a tailored tabu search algorithm. To obtain the input parameters of the problem for the real cases, some statistical techniques are used to analyze the data collected, such as multivariate correspondence analysis. The resulting solutions illustrate the potential application of the proposed approach to support planning and formatting decisions of travel itineraries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work contributes to this ongoing debate on the nature and the characteristics of propagation channels of crash events in international stock markets. Specifically, we investigate transmission mechanisms across stock markets along with effects from bond and currency markets. Our approach comprises a solid forecasting mechanism of the probability of a stock market crash event in various time frames. The developed approach combines different machine learning algorithms which are presented with daily stock, bond and currency data from 39 countries that cover a large spectrum of economies. Specifically, we leverage the merits of a series of techniques including Classification Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Deep Neural Networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Deep Learning and Boosting approaches are considered in the literature as a means of predicting stock market crisis episodes. The independent variables included in our data contain information regarding both the two fundamental linkage channels through which financial contagion can be initiated: returns and volatility. We apply a suite of machine learning algorithms for selecting the most relevant variables out of a large set of proposed ones. Finally, we employ bootstrap sampling for adjusting the imbalanced nature of the available fitting dataset. Our experimental results provide strong evidence that stock market crises tend to exhibit persistence. We also find significant evidence of interdependence and cross-contagion effects among stock, bond and currency markets. Finally, we show that the use of Deep Neural Networks significantly increases the classification accuracy, while offering a robust way to create a global systemic early warning tool that is more efficient and risk-sensitive than the currently established ones. Thus, central banks may use these tools to early adjust their monetary policy, so as to ensure financial stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present a novel feature extraction technique, termed Three-Dimensional Local Energy-Based Shape Histogram (3D-LESH), and exploit it to detect breast cancer in volumetric medical images. The technique is incorporated as part of an intelligent expert system that can aid medical practitioners making diagnostic decisions. Analysis of volumetric images, slice by slice, is cumbersome and inefficient. Hence, 3D-LESH is designed to compute a histogram-based feature set from a local energy map, calculated using a phase congruency (PC) measure of volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans in 3D space. 3D-LESH features are invariant to contrast intensity variations within different slices of the MRI scan and are thus suitable for medical image analysis.
   The contribution of this article is manifold. First, we formulate a novel 3D-LESH feature extraction technique for 3D medical images to analyse volumetric images. Further, the proposed 3D-LESH algorithmic, for the first time, applied to medical MRI images. The final contribution is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system (CDSS) as a multi-stage approach, combining novel 3D-LESH feature extraction with machine learning classifiers, to detect cancer from breast MRI scans. The proposed system applies contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) to the MRI images before extracting 3D-LESH features. Furthermore, a selected subset of these features is fed into a machine-learning classifier, namely, a support vector machine (SVM), an extreme learning machine (ELM) or an echo state network (ESN) classifier, to detect abnormalities and distinguish between different stages of abnormality. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique by its application to benchmark breast cancer MRI images. The results indicate high-performance accuracy of the proposed system (98%+/- 0.0050, with an area under a receiver operating charactertistic curve value of 0.9900 +/- 0.0050) with multiple classifiers. When compared with the state-of-the-art wavelet-based feature extraction technique, statistical analysis provides conclusive evidence of the significance of our proposed 3D-LESH algorithm.

AB Here, we report a three-dimensional (3D) network molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) on electrode surface to achieve an efficient and specific detection of theophylline in foodstuffs, using theophylline as the template molecule, mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNs) as the signal transducer to shuttle electrons, and both phenyltriethoxysilane and pyrrole as functional monomers. The electron microscope images reveal the presence of well-distributed hierarchically MSNs with a pomegranate-like morphology, topped with MIP uniform layer. Electrochemical characterizations were carried out to monitor the properties of the resulting sensing platform based on the MIP/gate effect employing hexacyanoferrate molecules as the electrochemical probe. The data show that due to the high conductivity and electron transfer ability of the prepared theophylline-imprinted membrane, this method exhibits excellent sensitivity and binding affinity with a linear dynamic concentration range in excess of six orders of magnitude and low detection limit (0.66 nM), meeting the requirements of theophylline trace analysis.

AB Natural anthocyanins are safer and nutritious as compared to synthetic pigments; however, their stability is poor. They can produce spontaneous copigmentation with organic acids, leading to the improvement of colour stability, albeit slowly. Box-Behnken experimental design was used to elucidate the mechanism of copigmentation between Vitis amurensis Rupr anthocyanins (0.1 mg/mL) and organic acids (0.87 mg/mL, ferulic acid:D-gluconic acid:caffeic acid:vanillic acid = 1.5:2.5:2.5:0.5, w/w/w/w) promoted by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP; 300 MPa, 2 min). The copigmentation effect and antioxidant activity of anthocyanins were also evaluated. The structure of anthocyanins was analysed using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry. The results of HHP copigmentation showed that the following anthocyanins were newly formed-delphinidin-3-O-catechol, petunidin-3-O-catechol, delphinidin 4 vinyl catechol, petunidin-3-O-guaiacol, malvidin-4-vinyl-guaiacol, cyanidin-3-O-(6 ''-O-caffeoyl) glucoside, peonidin 3-O-(6 ''-O-caffeoyl) glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-(6 ''-O-caffeoye-glucoside, malvidin-3-O-glucoside 4 vinyl guaiacol, and malvidin-3-O-(6 ''-O-feruloy1)-glucoside-owing to appropriate modifications that increased the copigmentation rate (R = 42.12%), photo-thermal stability (R > 45%), and potential antioxidant activities expressed in vivo (p < 0.01 vs. Model Group).

AB Chemical changes that occur during the storage and processing of food can affect its nutritional content. During digestion, the exposure of food to considerable variations of pH and high oxygen and peroxide concentrations also participates in the deterioration of nutrients, with a negative impact on the nutritional value of the diet and harmful consequences for human health. Iron plays a key role in gastrointestinal chemistry. Haem iron, which exists only in meat, and non-haem iron, present in most foods, are catalysts of most of the reactions implicated in the deterioration of nutrients. Disintegration of food matrix due to mechanical forces and enzymatic hydrolysis favour this endogenous process. This paper provides a review of what is known in the literature concerning the mechanisms and kinetics of endogenous reactions catalysed by iron. The main consequences on nutrient bioavailability are reported and protective strategies against the deleterious effect of iron are discussed.

AB Cereals supply humankind with carbohydrates, proteins and several health-enhancing compounds, including antioxidants. Pomace, a by-product of beetroot juice preparation, is rich in antioxidants (phenolic compounds and betalains). The aim of this work was to study the effect of pomace extract addition, either pure or micro-encapsulated, on antioxidant properties, heat damage and colour of einkorn water biscuits enriched with pseudocereals. Pomace extract addition had different effects on total polyphenol contents and antioxidant capacity (FRAP and ABTS) in diverse blends. In bread, wheat and einkorn matrices, a significant increase was observed, while in pseudocereals-enriched blends, richer in antioxidants, only microencapsulation improved their content. Pomace extract addition led to furosine reduction and hydroxymethylfurfural increase. Microencapsulate-enriched WB were richest in betanin, isobetanin, total phenolics and antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, pomace extracts, by-products of juice manufacturing, significantly improve some nutritional characteristics of baked products, especially when conveyed as microencapsulates.

AB Fruits of Lycium barbarum L. have been used in Chinese traditional medicine for centuries. In the last decade, there has been much interest in the potential health benefits of many biologically constituents of these fruits. The high level of carotenoids offers protection against development of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and related comorbidities.
   In the present work two different selections of Lycium barbarum L., cultivated in Italy and coming from three discrete harvest stages, were subjected to two different grinding procedure and to a simplified extraction method of carotenoid component. CIELAB colorimetric analysis of the freshly prepared purees and HPLC-DAD analysis of carotenoid extracts were performed and compared. Different harvesting dates and grinding procedures deeply influence the carotenoids content and statistical analysis showed high correlation between carotenoid content and colorimetric data.
   The final model provides a reliable tool to directly assess carotenoid content by performing cheap and routinely colorimetric analyses for food industry.

AB Evaluation of free amino acids (FAAs) and nucleotides in various food matrices has been a widely studied topic in recent years. Here, a fast and efficient strategy for the simultaneous analysis of 20 FAAs and six 5'-nucleotides, using stable isotope labeling-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (SIL-LC-MS/MS) is proposed. The method was validated with respect to selectivity, linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), recovery, precision, and stability. LOQs of most FFAs were lower than 1 ng/mL, and 5'-nucleotides were in the range of 5-20 ng/mL. FAAs and 5'-nucleotides in ten shiitake mushrooms from different cultivate areas were further analyzed. Results showed that the contents of cytidine 5'-monophosphate, adenosine 5'-monophosphate, lysine, threonine, arginine were significantly different. Principal component analysis showed clear discrimination of origins, seasons and species. Thus, the proposed method is suitable for the fast discrimination of species and geographical origins of shiitake mushrooms.

AB It is largely unknown how processing affects bioactive potential of chickpea proteins to prevent bowel inflammatory diseases. The aim was to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of protein concentrates from germinated and cooked chickpeas (GC and CC, respectively) and its relationship with protein and isoflavone composition before and after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and absorption. Anti-inflammatory activity of GC digests was almost 2-fold higher than CC digests (p < 0.05), which was associated to greater content of peptides, formononetin and biochanin A (p < 0.05). Anti-inflammatory activity of phenolic fraction in digests was 7-fold higher than the protein fraction (p < 0.05). The most active peptide fraction from GC digest (IC50 = 93 mu g/mL) contained a total of 24 peptides derived from legumin and vicilin. In conclusion, this study stands out the potential of germinated chickpea proteins concentrates to exert anti-inflammatory effects in the lower gut which may contribute to the prevention of bowel inflammatory diseases.

AB The phenolics profile of two new kiwifruit cultivars, Zespri (R) SunGold and Zespri (R) Sweet Green, were characterized and quantified for the first time using cyclic voltammetry, an electrochemical method, combined with HPLC. Results from the cyclic voltammetry revealed high correlations with those obtained from the spectrophotometry and HPLC methods, providing evidence to support the application of cyclic voltammetry as a rapid method in determining the phenolic profile and reducing power of kiwifruit extracts. Catechol-containing phenolics were identified as the major phenolic sub-class in the skins while flavonoids and phenolic acids were abundant in flesh of the tested cultivars. Epicatechin was the predominant phenolic compound and contributor to antioxidant capacity in all samples. Results also showed that SunGold and Sweet Green (both flesh and skin) exhibited significantly higher phenolic contents and antioxidant activities comparing with the well-established commercial 'Hayward' cultivar, indicating their commercial value and potential applications in food and nutraceuticals.

AB The current study demonstrated the electrospinning technique to stabilize the carotenoids. Gelatin nanofibers containing the carotenoids extracted from tomato peel (TP) were successfully fabricated with above 90% encapsulation efficiency by electrospinning. SEM analysis revealed that the extract-loaded fibers exhibit similar morphology as the neat fibers with a bead-free, smooth, and homogeneously-distributed morphology. Thermal stability of the extract was improved by nanoencapsulation. FTIR spectra showed that the TP extract could be compatibly entrapped into the gelatin fibers. Compared to non-encapsulated extract, the encapsulated one inside gelatin fibers had better retention of lycopene and antioxidant activity during 14-days storage. More interestingly, the water solubility of the carotenoid extract was highly enhanced compared to non-encapsulated one. By this study, it was realized that nanoencapsulation by electrospinning is an effective way to stabilize carotenoids and improve their water solubility, therefore it is promising to use them in food processing, especially including aqueous food matrix.

AB Pepsin is the first protease that food proteins encounter in the digestive tract. However, most of the previous studies on the enzymatic kinetics of pepsin were based on the hydrolysis of small synthetic peptides, due to the limitations in methodology and the complexity of protein substrate. To better understand the role of pepsin in protein digestion, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to study the enzymatic kinetics of pepsin with bovine serum albumin as the substrate. We found that pepsin has a higher catalytic rate at lower pH, while its affinity to substrate is lower. At the same pH, pepsin has lower activity and affinity at higher ionic strengths. We found contrasting kinetic parameters for pepsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of bovine serum albumin and of small synthetic peptides. Time-dependent kinetics also showed that pepsin has lower efficiency towards intermediate peptides during hydrolysis.

AB Understanding the mechanisms of combating phenolic stress in wine is important for optimization of starter culture for improved competitiveness. The cellular membrane adaptations, as well as metabolic transformations driven by malo-lactic starter cultures, i.e. Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp2565) and Oenococcus oeni (O02219) with response to wine phenolic compounds were studied. The morphological changes based on scanning electron microscopy indicated the higher tolerance of O02219 to phenolic stress than Lp2565. Further, the fatty acid profiling suggested that the membrane fluidization in Lp2565 was attributed to higher unsaturated fatty acids whereas the rigidification in O02219 was by incorporation of saturated fatty acid in the membrane. The metabolic transformation of phenolic compounds suggested that Lp2565 has more versatile phenolic detoxification enzyme systems compared to O02219. The metabolic conversions resulted in degradation of phenolic compounds into volatile phenols, aromatic alcohol, and phenyl propionic acids, thus indicating the possible involvement of oxidoreductases, decarboxylases, and demethylases.

AB In this research work grape stalk samples from the Douro region were analyzed concerning polyphenolic composition. Different solid-liquid extraction conditions were tested for reaching the optimal parameters to obtain higher amounts of polyphenols. In general, the best conditions comprise the use of a mixture of acetone/ethanol/water (1:1:1) at room temperature during 20 min, using a pre-wash treatment with deionized water. The polyphenolic extractions with acetone are generally more effective than without acetone.
   Total phenolic determination (Folin-Ciocalteu), antioxidant capacity (DPPH/FRAP) and more accurate methods such as HPLC-DAD and HPLC-ESI-MS were performed. An intensive polyphenolic characterization (including a possible identification of a new polyphenol) and compound quantification was achieved. A comparative study between these two analysis approaches was accomplished, which allowed to conclude that the Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH/FRAP determinations do not always allow a direct correspondence between high phenolic content or antioxidant/reducing capacity and real high polyphenolic content on crude polyphenolic extracts.

AB Durian (Durio zibethinus M.) is a major economic fruit crop in Thailand. In this study, two popular cultivars, namely Chanee and Mon Thong, were collected from three orchards located in eastern Thailand. The pulp metabolome, including 157 annotated metabolites, was explored using capillary electrophoresis-time of flight/mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS). Cultivars and harvest years had more impact on metabolite profile separation than cultivation areas. We identified cultivar-dependent metabolite markers related to durian fruit quality traits, such as nutritional value (pyridoxamine), odor (cysteine, leucine), and ripening process (aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid). Interestingly, durian fruit were found to contain high amounts of gamma-glutamylcysteine (810.3 +/- 257.5 mg/100 g dry weight) and glutathione (158.1 +/- 80.4 mg/100 g dry weight), which act as antioxidants and taste enhancers. This metabolite information could be related to consumer preferences and exploited for durian fruit quality improvement.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the proliferation effect of fractionated lotus seed resistant starch (LRS320%, LRS3-30%) and the structural changes following fermentation. Fractionated lotus seed resistant starch, especially LRS3-20%, promoted the proliferation of these probiotics, and Bifidobacterium longum produced large quantities of acetic acid, while Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus produced lactic acid. Additionally, the probiotics with lotus seed resistant starch (LRS3) and LRS3-20% survived more successfully in simulated gastrointestinal solutions compared to glucose, LRS3-30% and high amylose maize starch, but LRS3 and LRS3-20% differed in their abilities to enhance the tolerance to acidic buffer, bile acid and simulated gastric juice. Furthermore, after fermentation, fractionated lotus seed resistant starch displayed a loose, rough surface. The crystalline and double helical structure increased as the amount of amorphous and sub-crystalline structure reduced following fermentation. Interestingly, structural changes were correlated with the original structures and utilisation by the probiotics.

AB Wheat gluten hydrolysates (WGH) were used to examine their adsorption-desorption kinetics and thermodynamics characteristics on six macroporous resins, and their effects on the stress tolerance in brewer's yeast. Results showed that the pseudo second-order kinetics, Langmuir and Freundlich model could illuminate the adsorption mechanism, and the adsorption process was physical, spontaneous and exothermic. The 40% ethanol fraction separated by XAD-16 resin improved significantly the ethanol tolerance and the viability of brewer's yeast, while the 0% ethanol fraction separated by XAD-16 resin increased obviously the osmotic stress tolerance and the viability of brewer's yeast. Results from scanning electron microscopy showed that both these WGH fractions could increase budding rate and maintain normal morphology of yeast cells under various environmental stress. Thus, WGH separated by macroporous resin could be used in high gravity brewing to enhance the ethanol and osmotic stress tolerance in brewer's yeast.

AB Fucoidan is a marine sulfated polysaccharide that possesses various biological activities. To enhance the functional properties of fucoidan, it was depolymerized using a green technique viz. subcritical water treatment (SCW) to produce a low molecular weight fucoidan. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the influence of different influences for instance temperature, pressure, liquid to solid ratio, and agitation speed to depolymerize fucoidan. RSM was used to focus on the antioxidant activity and chemical composition of SCW-treated fucoidan. Further, resulting SCW-treated fucoidan was investigated by UV-Vis, FT-IR, Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), DSC, Elemental analysis, and ESI-MS. Moreover, the optimized SCW-treated fucoidan was checked for cytotoxicity, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and anticoagulant activity compared with the untreated fucoidan. The obtained values displayed that SCW treatment breakdowns polymer chain and so it produces low molecular weight fucoidan. Biological activities were improved as the molecular weight was reduced.

AB Bixin is one of the most used yellow-orange food colorants in the food industry. The polyene chain of bixin makes it highly hydrophobic and less suitable for water-based food formulations. Lipase-catalyzed reactions of bixin with sorbitol were studied to synthesize a new derivative of bixin with potential hydrophilic properties. Interestingly, we show that the lipase-catalyzed reaction of bixin leads to a transesterification reaction and formation of a transesterified product, sorbitol ester of norbixin (SEN). The reaction efficiency was optimized with various immobilized lipases at different water activity levels in the organic solvent, 2-methyl-2-butanol. Among the examined lipases, immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (Novozyme 435) provided the highest reaction yield at a water activity close to zero. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as co-solvent to improve bixin solubility. The optimization of the reaction conditions with 20% THF lead to a total reaction yield of 50% of SEN.

AB The possibility of usage mushroom industry wastage, as a source of antimicrobial biopolymer chitosan to form active edible coatings was studied. It was found that the champignon stipe, an underutilized part of the mushroom, gave rise to a higher chitosan yield than caps (176 vs. 105 mg/g). Fungal chitosan caused a total growth inhibition of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast and Escherichia coil bacteria at concentrations of 1% and 2%, respectively. The fungal chitosan-based edible coatings were applied on fresh-cut melons and found to enhance fruit firmness, inhibit off-flavors and reduce the microbial counts (up to 4 log CFU/g). Volatiles profile showed the coated melons have a higher content of esters responsible for fruit flavor (79.93% and 57.15% for fungal chitosan coated melon and uncoated melon, respectively). This study demonstrates that waste from the mushroom industry can be utilized for the production of non-animal sourced chitosan to form active edible coatings.

AB Broccoli sprouts are considered functional food as they are naturally enriched in glucoraphanin (GR) that is the biological precursor of the anticancer compound sulforaphane (SFN). Due to its health promoting value, also broccoli sprout juice is becoming very popular.
   The present study aimed to quantitatively assess the conversion of GR to its hydrolysis products, SFN and SFN-nitrile, during the juice preparation process. We demonstrated that SFN plus SFN-nitrile yield from glucoraphanin is quite low (approximate to 25%) and that some SFN is lost during the juice preparation partially due to the spontaneous conversion to sulforaphane-amine or conjugation to GSH and proteins naturally present in the juice. Our results demonstrate that the detection of the sole SFN free form does not provide reliable information about the real concentration of this functional compound in the juice.

AB Pu-erh tea is one of the most popular tea beverages in China. Storage time, fermentation process and origin of production affect quality and price of Pu-erh teas. High resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach, NIR combined with chemometric analysis were used to profile water soluble metabolites from raw Bingdao Pu-erh teas stored for 1-10 years and teas from various production sites. Year prediction models with good rate of recognition were established using partial least squares analysis and factor analysis. 38 characteristic compounds were identified that can be used to distinguish length of storage of Pu-erh teas. 19 characteristic compounds were found that can be used to differentiate raw and ripened teas. Cluster analysis of Pu-erh teas from different sites showed correlation between geographical distribution of the sites and composition of the water extracts. The research provides guidance for discrimination of Pu-erh teas and helps establish a healthy tea market.

AB The impact of supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCD) (10-60 MPa/45 degrees C/30 min) and subsequent 10 weeks storage at 4 degrees C on polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD) activities, phenolic profile, vitamin C, sugars, physico-chemical properties of cloudy apple juices was investigated.
   No significant changes in sugars and total polyphenols were observed, whereas significant degradation (approximate to 28%) of vitamin C and individual polyphenols (approximate to 18%) was noted after SCCD treatment. After 4 weeks storage only 34% of vitamin C was retained and no vitamin C was detected after this time. Ten weeks of storage caused hydrolysis of sucrose in 15%, whereas degradation of individual polyphenols ranged from 43 to 50% depending on the pressure applied. The highest pressure was applied the highest retention of polyphenols was observed. The lightness of juice significantly increased by 15% after SCCD and decreased during storage. Moreover, the synergistic effect of both enzymes with chlorogenic acid and catechol was found.

AB Grapes and wine contain phenolics divided into non-flavonoid and flavonoid classes. Yeast modulates the phenolics of wine by adsorption onto yeast cell walls. This may be advantageous for colour and quality. The effect of Torulaspora delbrueckii (654&M2/1) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (VIN13) on phenolics and sensory attributes of Cabernet Franc wines (2012/2013) were evaluated. Spectrophotometric analysis was used to determine the phenolic content. Sensory analysis was conducted by expert tasters to evaluate the wines. ANOVA showed that polyphenols and anthocyanins were higher in M2/1 + VIN13 wines (2012/2013) than 654 + VIN13 wines. Colour, fruitiness, mouthfeel, sweetness, astringency and quality were different between treatments. 654 + VIN13 wines (2012) were higher in polyphenols, acidity, astringency and mouthfeel than M2/1 + VIN13 wines. M2/1 + VIN13 (2012/2013) had increased colour and quality than 654 + VIN13 wines. Two treatments were identified for Cabernet Franc wines; M2/1 + VIN13 and 654 + VIN13, which resulted in wines with increased colour and wines with increased mouthfeel and astringency, respectively.

AB Acetophenone and its analogues are naturally-occurring compounds found in many foods and plants. In this study, a series of acetophenone benzoylhydrazones 5a-o were designed and synthesized as new potential antioxidant agents. Designed molecules contain hydrazone and phenolic hydroxyl moieties which possibly contribute to antioxidant activity. The antioxidant properties of compounds 5a-o in terms of reducing ability and radical-scavenging activity were assessed by using FRAP and DPPH tests, respectively. While the unsubstituted compound 5a had the superior capacity in the FRAP assay, the 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone analogue 5g was the most potent radical scavenger in the DPPH method. The antioxidant potential of representative compounds 5a and 5g was further confirmed by TEAC and ORAC assays. Cell viability assays revealed that while the promising compounds 5a and 5g had no significant toxicity against HepG2 and NIH3T3 cells, they potently protected HepG2 cells against H2O2 -induced oxidative damage at low concentrations. Furthermore, spectroscopic studies with different biometals demonstrated that 5g was able to interact with Cu2+ to form a 1:1 complex.

AB A novel colorimetric sensor array based on boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes was developed to monitor the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of rice at different storage times. The VOCs of rice at different storage times were analyzed through GC-MS combined with multivariate analysis, and the compound 18-crown-6 was found significantly changed during rice aging process. Aimed at 18-crown-6 with particular macrocyclic structure, a series of BODIPYs were targeted synthesized for the selection of sensitive chemically responsive dyes. Four dyes were chosen to construct colorimetric sensor array based on sensitivity to VOCs of aged rice samples. Data acquired from the interactions of dyes and rice VOCs were subjected to the principal components analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The optimal performance obtained by the LDA model was 98.75% in prediction set. Application of BODIPYs in this work has improved the sensitivity and expanded the choices of colorimetric dyes for the specific detection.

AB This study reports, for the first time, data on nutritional quality parameters in Tunisian mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, with an especial emphasis on lipid compounds. Mussel condition index (CI), proximate composition and fatty acid profiles were investigated for a one year period in order to identify the best harvesting period. Analysis revealed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were the dominant fatty acids with a prevalence of n-3 over n-6 forms. Pearson's correlation indicated a strong relationship between CI and PUFA compound and Principal Components Analysis suggested that, from winter to summer, the product maintained a condition sufficiently good for marketing. The best CI and lipid quantity/quality occurred during summer and this may be used as criteria for product labelling. The study also included a thorough literature review that allowed data comparison on mussels from various Mediterranean sites and allowed the mussels from the Bizerte lagoon (North of Tunisia) to be differentiated.

AB The study aimed at improving the antioxidant activity of beta-conglycinin to enhance the oxidative and physical stabilities of safflower oil-in-water emulsion stabilized by beta-conglycinin. Heating promoted binding affinity and antioxidant activity of beta-conglycinin. Catechin and chlorogenic acid showed higher binding affinities towards unheated (or heated) beta-conglycinin than caffeic acid and quercetin. The enhancement efficiencies of the phenolics on the antioxidant activity of unheated (or heated) beta-conglycinin decreased in the order of catechin > quercetin > chlorogenic acid > caffeic acid. Hydrophobic force and hydrogen bonding were the important binding forces for the selected phenolics to beta-conglycinin. The complexation with catechin has no side effect on interfacial behavior and emulsifying property of beta-conglycinin. The use of heated beta-conglycinin-catechin complex as an emulsifier for preparing safflower oil emulsion effectively improved the oxidative and physical stabilities of the emulsion treated with lipoxygenase through inhibition of lipid oxidation, protein carbonyl formation and sulfhydryl loss.

AB Three types of inulin with different degree of polymerization (average DP < 10, DP >= 10, and DP > 23) were used to improve the freeze-thaw stability of rice starch gel. The gels with or without addition of inulin were subjected to seven freeze-thaw cycles (FTC). Inulin enhanced the water holding capacity and reduced the amount of freezable water of the gels, thereby decreasing the syneresis of the gels during seven FTC. In addition, the amylose and amylopectin retrogradation of the gels were retarded. By adding inulin, the microstructure of gel network was stabilized, and the deterioration in viscoelastic properties of the gels during seven FTC was reversed. Therefore, inulin was an effective additive for preserving the quality of freeze-thawed rice starch gels. Furthermore, low DP inulin had higher water holding capacity than high DP one, as a result the inulin with lower DP was more effective.

AB The effects of the interaction of whey protein isolate (WPI) and casein (CS) with chlorogenic acid (CA; 20, 120 and 240 mu mol/g protein) on the structural and functional properties of proteins were investigated. CA induced significant structural changes, increased digestibility, and improved functionalities of CS and WPI. Non-covalent association between CA and treated proteins was detected using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and ANS-augmented fluorescence. The CA binding affinity for WPI was superior to that for CS as indicated by higher K-sv. and lower hydrophobicity. Total sulfhydryl content in CS and WPI decreased, respectively, from 5.4 to 3.2 mu mol/g and from 21 to 7.8 mu mol/g, and surface hydrophobicity declined by 16.6% and 22.4% with 240 mu mol/g CA. Enhanced solubility and foaming capacity of the protein-phenol complex were demonstrated. CA at medium and high concentrations displayed a remarkable synergism of radical scavenging activity with peptides in both protein digests.

AB As one of the most toxic mycotoxins, aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) is a major food pollutant which can pose a high risk to human health. In this work, an accurate fluorescent sensing method was proposed for AFB(1) determination, based on hairpin structure of G-quadruplex oligonucleotide-Aptamer chimera, silica nanoparticles coated with streptavidin (SNPs-Streptavidin) and N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM). The hairpin structure of chimera and SNPs-Streptavidin allowed AFB(1) detection with high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the developed sensor could detect AFB(1) in 30 min. The relative fluorescence intensity increased as AFB(1) concentrations increased with a linear range of 30-900 pg/mL and a limit of detection (LOD) of 8 pg/mL. The constructed aptasensor was successfully employed to assess AFB(1) spiked grape juice and human serum samples. The analytical recovery of AFB(1) in the grape juice samples ranged from 95 to 106%, implying the great potential of the presented aptasensor in food product analysis.

AB Calafate is a berry with high concentration of anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acids that grows in South Patagonia. To date, no metabolism studies of phenolic compounds using calafate have been carried out. A calafate extract was characterized by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS. After extract administration (300 mg/kg), a pharmacokinetic study of phenolic compounds in gerbil plasma was performed by GC-MS/MS. Sixteen phenolic acids increased after intake. Phenylacetic acid derivatives exhibit the highest concentration, while main increase of phenolic catabolites was observed 2 h post-intake. 3-hydroxyphenylacetic and phenylacetic acids increased at 4-8h post-intake. All catabolites found in gerbil plasma exhibit concentration peaks between 0.1 and 1 mu M, however no parental anthocyanins were detected. Establish in vivo plasmatic concentration ranges of phenolic compounds derived from polyphenol consumption following WHO recommendations, plays a key role to carry out future in vitro assays in order to correctly assign biological benefits of calafate berry consumption.

AB One of the most commonly consumed mushrooms in Europe is Cantharellus cibarius, also known as chanterelles. Therefore, the investigation of the pro-health properties of crude polysaccharides from this species was performed. The obtained results indicate that the polysaccharide fraction from C. cibarius inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. Moreover, the prebiotic potential was revealed in relation to Lactobacillus strains. Crude polysaccharides were found to inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cells with the simultaneous absence of toxicity towards normal cells. The purification and structural characterization of the examined polysaccharide fraction from C. cibarius indicates that it consists of one monosaccharide in the repeating unit -> 6)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 ->. The presented activities indicate for the first time that this edible mushroom possesses interesting chemopreventive potential, especially against colon cancer.

AB Swelled cornstarch granules incubated at different incubation temperatures was prepared as a complexation matrix to encapsulate lutein. Increasing incubation temperature (55-70 degrees C) induced the gelatinization of cornstarch, resulting in enhancement of swelling power (1.67-6.26 g/g) and lutein content (0.78-4.86 mg/g). A decreased (double helix of amylopectin) and an increased (single helix of V-amylose) enthalpy change were associated with the increased incubation temperature. The retention index of lutein in the composites incubated at 65 degrees C and 70 degrees C could achieve 76% after 21 days of storage. Less than 30% of lutein in the composites was released after incubating for 120 min under stomach conditions. Fast lutein release was observed during the first 20 min intestinal digestion, consistent with starch hydrolysis data. This study opens a promising pathway for swelled cornstarch granules as delivery carriers of bioactive ingredients, which are of vital importance for their potential use in the sensitive food supplement

AB Transglutaminase (TGase) was selected as model enzyme to investigate the effects of microwave (MW) heating on its activity and structure compared to water bath (WB) heating. MW heating can enhance the activity of TGase and reach the maximum at 20 min, whereas conduction heating has lithe effect on the activity of TGase. The difference of dielectric properties between MW heating and WB heating were not obvious, but MW heating had higher conductivity than WB heating. The results of ultraviolet and fluorescence spectra show that MW heating can change the enzyme activity by changing the conformation of TGase. The decrease of alpha-helix and an increase of beta-sheet and beta-turn investigated by circular dichroism (CD) indicated the secondary structures of TGase were changed when treated by MW heating. Further gel properties test confirmed that TGase treated by MW could improve the functional and mechanical properties of surimi gel.

AB Relations between the apple cortex viscoelastic properties, water dynamics, histological, and chemical characteristics were investigated. Water mobility in four apple genotypes was studied by low-field NMR relaxometry prior and after plasmolysis of the cortex tissue. A discrete and a continuous method for decomposing the multi-exponential T-2 curves were implemented and compared. The results show that both methods of relaxation curve decomposition had close ability to discriminate genotypes before and after plasmolysis. Although the sensitivity of T-2 relaxometry allowed distinguishing microstructures among genotypes even after cellular fluids were mixed and diffused in plasmolyzed tissues, no relaxation component correlated with apple viscoelasticiy. Galactose and arabinose cell wall content were correlated with the storage modulus (E') prior and after plasmolysis though the correlation signs were opposite and pointed to a potential key role of pectin RGI side chains in regulating apple texture in turgid tissue.

AB Anthocyanins express many hues depending on environmental factors and structural aspects, of which aglycone structure and acylation have been considered most impactful. Effects of different glycosylations on anthocyanins' colors are less known. Twelve cyanidin and 3-deoxy-cyanidin (luteolinidin) derivatives were isolated from red cabbage and black carrot hydrolysates and from black sorghum, diluted in pH 1-9, and analyzed by spectrophotometry and colorimetry. Location, number, and structure of glycosylations affected lambda(max) and spectral shape of o-dihydroxylated anthocyanins, playing important roles on color expression. Generally, glycosylation of cyanidin decreased its lambda(max) (<= 27 nm), greatest decreases by 3-monoglycosylation. All cyanidin-glycosides appeared red in pH 1-3 and paled in pH 4-6. However, cyanidin-3-glycosides did not decolor completely like 3,5-glycosides. In alkaline pH, glycosylation patterns affected color more greatly: Cy-3-glycosides expressed maroon-purple hues (300-20 degrees), 5-glycosides were green (100-115 degrees), and only 3,5-glycosides expressed blue (240-250 degrees). Luteolinidin derivatives shifted from yellow to red-purple hues with increasing pH.

AB The adsorption and desorption characteristics of six different resins (NKA-9, XAD-2, AB-8, D3520, DM-130 and Polyamide) were investigated, in order to screen one resin compared favorably with XAD-2 resin for the purification of flavonoids from honey. The adsorption capacity was XAD-2 > AB-8 > DM-130 > D3520 > NKA-9 > Polyamide, and the desorption ratios of XAD-2, AB-8 and DM-130 had no significant differences, which was higher than those of D3520, NKA-9 and Polyamide. By analyzing kinetic adsorption using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and particle diffusion kinetics models combined with kinetic desorption, the adsorption and desorption behavior of AB-8 was similar to that of XAD-2, which was excellent than other four resins. The optimal temperature for XAD-2 and AB-8 to adsorb flavonoids was 25 degrees C under the analysis of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms models. AB-8 resin offers an efficient and economical choice for the purification of flavonoids from honey.

AB Conventional magnetic effervescent tablet has many drawbacks, such as not practicable for field processing, rapid moisture absorption, and poor tablet storage characteristics. Herein, we developed a novel magnetic effervescent tablet containing ionic liquid microextraction (MET-ILM) for determination of pyrethroids in dairy milk. It contains only Na2CO3 as an alkali source (no acidic source) in the Fe3O4 magnetic tablet; the CO2-forming reaction is initiated in the acidic solution containing the analyzes, and thus the prepared tablet can be stored for long time periods without deterioration. The combined action of extractant and sorbent vastly increase the extraction efficiency. The optimized procedure consisted of an effervescent tablet, 2:1 HCl:Na2CO3, and 60 mu L [C6MIM]PF6 as extraction solvent. The LODs for five pyrethroids were 0.024-0.075 mu g kg(-1) with recoveries of 78.3-101.8%. The RSDs were 4.8% and 6.3% for intra- and inter-day precisions. Overall, the method is very feasible for use in the field.

AB Indigenous strains of lactic acid bacteria previously isolated from raw donkey milk samples were used to ferment donkey milk. Each sample was subjected to an in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID) and analysis of the digesta by HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap XL was performed in order to obtain a comprehensive peptide profile of fermented donkey milk. Functional properties such as ACE-inhibitory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the resulting fermented donkey milks, as well as characterization of the bioactive peptides produced by an in vitro SGID, were assayed. All bioactivities were found to be high in fermented milk and a further significant increase was observed after SGID. The Enterococcus faecium DM33 fermented milk exhibited the strongest antioxidant and the highest antimicrobial activities. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was observed in milk fermented with Lactobacillus casei DM214. These findings will contribute to the development of a new functional dairy drink with anti-hypertensive, antimicrobial and/or antioxidant activities.

AB A novel dispersive magnetic solid phase microextraction method based on ionic liquid-coated and cyclodextrinfunctionalized magnetic core dendrimer nanocomposites has been developed for the determination of pyrethroids in juice samples. The different generation magnetic core dendrimer nanocomposites were successfully synthesized and the nanocomposites possess both the selective retention of guest dendrimer and cyclodextrin molecules and high adsorption capacities of ionic liquids. The extraction efficiencies of different generation magnetic core dendrimer nanocomposites were compared, and the type of nanocomposite with the highest recovery was obtained. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the method showed good linearity in the range of 3.5-500 mu g L-1. The LODs and LOQs were in the ranges of 0.36-1.3 mu g L-1 and 1.2-4.3 mu g L-1, respectively. The method also showed acceptable accuracies ranging from 98.2% to 99.4%. The proposed method was demonstrated to broaden the potential applications of dendrimer for the detection of pyrethroid residues in various juice samples.

AB Firm berries are highly appreciated by table grape consumers. Cell wall composition is one of the main factors influencing the firmness of table grape berries. Nevertheless, the biological factors driving changes in berry firmness remain unclear. In the present work, we evaluated the firmness of berries of Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless. We selected two orchards displaying contrasting berry firmness and evaluated polar metabolites and cell wall composition. Our results suggest that berries from the soft orchard exhibited a higher accumulation of sugars at veraison whereas berries from the hard orchard accumulated the same sugars at harvest plus a higher amount of glucose monosaccharide at the cell wall. Thus, this study opens new insights about a connection between metabolic and cell wall changes with fruit firmness in a table grape variety, suggesting that it is possible to use metabolomic tools to identify metabolic biomarkers associated with table grape berry firmness.

AB Soy protein isolate (SPI) was first treated with glutaminase to yield modified SPI (E-SPI) before its complexation with curcumin. Comparisons were made between SPI and E-SPI concerning their characteristics and effectiveness in complexing with curcumin, along with changes in physicochemical properties, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH.)-scavenging capacity and storage stability of curcumin upon complexation. The action of glutaminase did not markedly change SPI structure, but modified some secondary structures, causing greater protein unfolding with more hydrophobic clusters and amino acids exposed. Glutaminase treatment increased DPPH. -scavenging capacity, foaming capacity and stability of SPI. The protein concentration played a role in the changes induced by glutaminase treatment and complexation with curcumin, and 1% protein seemed beneficial (highest DPPH scavenging activity; highest loading amount 10.07%; 98% and > 90% curcumin retained in 1%-E-SPI at 4 degrees C for 2 h and 12 h, respectively). Therefore, glutaminase treatment of SPI before complexation with curcumin appeared to be appropriate.

AB Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni has gained increased industrial and scientific interests in the last 20 years, representing a suitable nutritional alternative to sucrose and artificial sweeteners. Moreover, this plant contains polyphenols, chlorophylls, and carotenoids that may be extracted for production of nutraceuticals and functional foods. Because of nutritional and technological advantages over sucrose, innovative approaches for the extraction of highly valued compounds from Stevia leaves have been developed and optimized. In contrast to conventional alternatives, innovative extraction methods allow higher yields in a shorter time, less usage of organic solvents, and reduced energy consumption. In this paper, the use of innovative extraction techniques: MAE, UAE, HPAE, PLE, SFE, PEF, HVED, cold plasma, and RSLDE for the recovery of non-nutrients with putative health benefits from Stevia leaves is discussed.

AB Pullulanase (P) and ultrasonication (U) were simultaneously applied to debranch pea starch to enhance slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) fractions in the debranched pea starch (DPS). A synergistic debranching effect was found under conditions of pullulanase (40 npun/g) and ultrasonication (100% amplitude in pulse mode, 1 min on followed by 9 min off), which produced 73.5% linear glucans, 18% SDS and 26% RS in the resulting DPS-PU after 6 h of debranching. Even when autoclaving the DPS-PU at 118 degrees C for 30 min, following cooldown, 11% SDS and 25% RS were retained in the DPS-PU, compared with 0% SDS and 12% RS in autoclaved native pea starch. The SDS fraction in autoclaved DPS-PU further increased to 16% while the RS content remained constant during 14 days of cold storage. In summary, DPS-PU is high in linear glucans, low in starch digestibility and has a thermally stable RS fraction.

AB For nine symmetric natural carotenoids, a comprehensive thermodynamics study of processes associated with their radical scavenging activity is proposed. We have investigated the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from the parent carotenoid, mono-radical species, radical cations and radical anions. Electron transfer and proton transfer reactions were also studied. Terminal units and carbon atoms in their vicinity were identified as thermodynamically favoured reaction sites of the HAT mechanism. Rhodoxanthin, canthaxanthin and astaxanthin, as strong antioxidants, without any pro-oxidative effect, were found to have bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE) higher than 300 kJ mol(-1) and the most negative electron affinities. The electron transfer to a carotenoid is exothermic, while other studied reactions are endothermic. In solvent, the electron transfer reactions may be preferred instead of hydrogen atom transfer.

AB This study investigated the effects of a twin-screw extrusion-cooking process on the modification of garlic skin dietary fiber (DF) under optimal conditions (feed moisture 25%, extrusion temperature 170 degrees C and screw speed 170 rpm). The evaluation of the soluble dietary fiber (SDF) from the extruded garlic skin on the capacity of Pb binding was determined in vivo. Compared with the untreated garlic skin, the content of extruded garlic skin SDF increased from 5.31 +/- 0.58% to 15.87 +/- 0.88%. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images demonstrated that the macromolecules deteriorated to form smaller SDF fractions during extrusion. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectra showed the thermal stability of the extruded SDF was highly improved after extrusion. Additionally, in vivo experimental results indicated that the addition of extruded DF significantly reduced the Pb absorptivity of rats with exposed Pb concentrations at 20, 100 and 200 mg/kg. The findings showed that the extruded garlic skin DF has a positive effect on Pb binding.

AB Recently there has been an increased demand for functional foods to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases mainly related to hypercholesterolemia, because of undesirable side effects of traditional drugs (statins). Hence, in the quest for natural and safer alternatives, this work is aimed to bring together the health-promoting properties of probiotics, soymilk, bovine milk and green tea into one product, i.e., soy-fortified green tea curd (GTC). This study includes isolation and characterization of microbes for probiotic attributes, from locally made curd which could reduce cholesterol and produce angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in vitro. The best isolate was used for the production of soy-fortified GTC, and the effect of refrigerated storage on bacterial viability, tea polyphenol contents, and organoleptic properties was investigated. CH (Enterococcus faecium) depicted best probiotic potential amongst the 15 isolates. Soy-fortified GTC depicted higher probiotic viability for a longer duration during refrigerated storage and greater ACEI activity than unfortified GTC.

AB Phenolic composition of potatoes (Solarium tuberosum) with colored flesh has been previously reported, highlighting their anthocyanin composition. However, there is less information available about the profiles and concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (HCADs) in these potatoes. In pigmented potatoes from Southern Chile, three HCADs have been detected, corresponding to the trans isomers of 3-, 4- and 5-caffeoylquinic acid. It is remarkable that after frying, the HCAD concentrations increased 493% compared to those of fresh potatoes. The same tendency has been observed for total phenols and antioxidant activity of the chips. The results obtained are relevant in relation to the classification of pigmented potatoes as functional foods not only due to their anthocyanin content but also due to their higher content of HCADs, especially since their concentration increases considerably after frying, thus contributing to their antioxidant activity and potential beneficial effects for human health compared with uncolored genotypes.

AB The ethanol extract of the commercial tannin Tan'Activ C, (from Castanea sativa wood), employed in oenology, was subjected to chromatography on XAD-16 affording fractions X1-X5, evaluated for total phenols content (GAE), antioxidant activity (DPPH, ORAC), and hypoglycemic activity (alpha-glucosidase inhibition). Fraction X3 showed GAE, radical scavenging activity, and alpha-glucosidase inhibition higher than those of the Castanea sativa extract, and was subjected to chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 to obtain fractions Sl-S7, analyzed by HPLC/ESI-MS/MS and H-1 NMR to identify the main active constituents. In fractions with higher antioxidant activity, gallic acid (4), grandinin (5), valoneic acid dilactone (9), 1,2,3-tri-O-galloyl-beta-glucose (14), 3,4,6 tri-O-galloyl-beta-glucose (15) and galloyl derivative of valoneic acid dilactone (21) were identified as the major constituents. The highest hypoglycemic activity was found in fractions S6 and especially S7; the major constituents of these fractions are valoneic acid dilactone (9), three tetragalloyl glucose isomers (16-18) and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-glucose (23), previously reported as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.

AB Eggplant is a vegetable crop that is grown around the world and can provide significant nutritive benefits thanks to its abundance of vitamins, phenolics and antioxidants. In addition, eggplant has potential pharmaceutical uses that are just now becoming recognized. As compared to other crops in the Solanaceae, few studies have investigated eggplant's metabolic profile. Metabolomics and metabolic profiling are important platforms for assessing the chemical composition of plants and breeders are increasingly concerned about the nutritional and health benefits of crops. In this review, the historical background and classification of eggplant are shortly explained; then the beneficial phytochemicals, antioxidant activity and health effects of eggplant are discussed in detail.

AB The study aimed to perform a meta-analysis on the fate of ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEN), deoxynivalenol (DON) and total aflatoxin (TAF) during steps of bread and pasta-based products processing. A total of twenty and eight articles (549 data) collected from 1983 through June 2017 were included. Some of the investigated processing such as milling and fermentation caused an increase in the concentration of DON and TAF; although they reduce the concentration of ZEN and OTA. Also, heat processing (cooking) decrease the DON, OTA, and TAF and increase the concentration of ZEN in bread. Cooking reduces the concentration of DON and ZEN in the biscuit. Cooking of pasta reduces the content of DON; however, it increases the concentration of TFA. The findings showed that the mycotoxins and their fate were influenced differently by the unit operations steps involved in the preparation of the different cereal-based products.

AB The use of tailored particle-based adjuvants constitutes a promising way to enhance antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. However, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying their adjuvanticity is crucial to generate more effective vaccines. We studied the ability of chitosan-aluminum nanoparticles (CH-Al NPs), which combine the immunostimulatory effects of chitosan and aluminum salts, to promote dendritic cell activation, assess their impact on innate and adaptive immune responses, and compare the results to those reported for conventional chitosan particles (CH-Na NPs). All tested CH-NP formulations were capable of modulating cytokine secretion by dendritic cells. CH-Al NPs promoted NLRP3 inflammasome activation, enhancing the release of IL-1 beta without significantly inhibiting Th1 and Th17 cell-polarizing cytokines, IL-12p70 or IL-23, and induced DC maturation, but did not promote pro-inflammatory cytokine production on their own.
   In vivo results showed that mice injected with CH-Al NPs generated a local inflammatory response comparable to that elicited by the vaccine adjuvant alum. Importantly, after subcutaneous immunization with CH-Al NPs combined with the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), mice developed antigen-specific IgG titers in serum, nasal and vaginal washes.
   Overall, our results established CH-Al NPs as a potential adjuvant to enhance both innate and adaptive immune responses.

AB In the present study, we have developed the robust nanoparticles (MGC-GNP/PTX), which are TAMs and tumor cells-dual recognizable, for targeting cancer therapy. Of great importance, the developed nano-platforms are glutathione (GSH)-activable, which means it remains structure intact under normal physiological condition and can be disrupted when exposed to certain concentration of GSH. As demonstrated by the drug release assay in vitro, MGC-GNP/PTX exhibited an excellent structure stability under the normal condition with only 10% of cumulative drug release at 72 h. However, after increasing the concentration of GSH to 1 mM or 10 mM, the release of PTX from the nanoparticles was significantly accelerated and approximately 35% or 95% of drugs was released. Cellular experiments and in vivo tumor targeting assay displayed that the developed nanoparticles have a super capacity of tumor cells and TAMs-dual targeting drug delivery, which resulted in much stronger cytotoxicity when compared to the unmodified ones. Finally, the pharmacodynamic evaluation indicated that the mice treated with MGC-GNP/PTX displayed the strongest tumor suppression ability versus other groups. More importantly, the treatment of MGC-GNP/PTX did not significantly influence the body weight and pathological of the mice, indicated that the prepared nanoparticle system had a satisfactory bio-safety for targeting tumor drug delivery.

AB Development of safe and efficient non-viral vectors to deliver DNA into the CNS represents a huge challenge to face many neurological disorders. We elaborated niosomes based on DOTMA cationic lipid, lycopene "helper" lipid and polysorbate 60 as non-ionic surfactants for gene delivery to the CNS. Niosomes, and their corresponding nioplexes obtained after the addition of the pCMS-EGFP plasmid, were characterized in terms of size, charge, morphology and capacity to condense, release and protect DNA. In vitro experiments were performed in NT2 cells to evaluate transfection efficiency, viability, cellular uptake and intracellular distribution. Additionally, transfection in primary cortex cells were performed prior to brain administration into rat cerebral cortex. Data obtained showed that nioplexes exhibited not only adequate physicochemical properties for gene delivery applications, but also relevant transfection efficiencies (17%), without hampering viability (90%). Interestingly, In vivo experiments depicted promising protein expression in both cortical glial cells and blood vessels.

AB Spray freeze drying is an attractive technology to produce powder formulation for inhalation. It can be used to generate large porous particles which tend to aerosolize efficiently and do not aggregate readily. It also avoids material to be exposed to elevated temperature. In this study, we reported the use of two-fluid nozzle to produce spray freeze dried powder of small interfering RNA (siRNA). The effect of atomization gas flow rate and liquid feed rate were inspected initially using herring sperm DNA (hsDNA) as nucleic acid model. The atomization gas flow rate was found to have a major impact on the aerosol properties. The higher the atomization gas flow rate, the smaller the particle size, the higher the fine particle fraction (FPF). In contrast, the liquid feed rate had very minor effect. Subsequently, spray freeze dried siRNA powder was produced at various atomization gas flow rates. The particles produced were highly porous as examined with the scanning electron microscopy, and the structural integrity of the siRNA was demonstrated with gel electrophoresis. The gene-silencing effect of the siRNA was also successfully preserved in vitro. The best performing siRNA formulation was prepared at the highest atomization gas flow rate investigated with a moderate FPF of 30%. However, this was significantly lower than that obtained with the corresponding hsDNA counterparts (FPF similar to 57%). A direct comparison between the hsDNA and siRNA formulations revealed that the former exhibited a lower density, hence a smaller aerodynamic diameter despite similar geometric size.

AB Self-assembling aliphatic heparin derivatives were shown to inhibit the immune system by antagonizing Toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation protein 2 (TLR4/MD2). In the present study, glycol split heparin-D-erythrosphingosine conjugates (NAHNP) and its regioselectively desulfated derivatives with shortened aliphatic chains were investigated regarding their biophysical properties in the interaction with TLR4/MD2. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy studies showed that upon glycol splitting, the heparin backbone gains extra adaptability that facilitates binding to proteins. However, unlike native heparin or glycol split non-anticoagulant heparin (NAH), hydrophobic derivatization of NAH forces sulfated iduronic acid residues to change configuration from a S-2(0) skew-boat to a C-1(4) chair form. Whereas neither heparin nor NAH had any appreciable effect, NAHNP significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of the NF-KB transcription factor. We showed that NAHNP binds to TLR4/MD2 with an affinity of 62.3 nM. In line with computational studies, biosensor-based structure-kinetic relationship studies demonstrated that 6-O-sulfo groups of D-glucosamine residue were essential in binding to arginines of both TLR4 and MD2 domains of the receptor complex. The desulfation of 6-0-sulfo groups decreases the association kinetics from 4.2 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1) to 3.8 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1), which results in a decreased affinity of 800 nM. Two aliphatic chains of NAHNP bound to the MD2 pocket similarly to lipopolysaccharide. A decrease in chain length resulted in a loss of inhibitory activity on NF-KB transcription and binding affinity to TLR4/MD2. In conclusion, the present study characterizes the immunosuppressive effect of aliphatic heparin derivatives and provides a promising strategy to develop selective immunosuppressants for acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.

AB Overcoming blood-brain barrier (BBB) for precise glioma diagnosis remains an urgent challenge due to its peculiar location in central nervous system (CNS). Herein, polymer-coated carbon nanodots with high hydrophilicity were facilely married with Gd-DTPA to construct a dual-modal imaging system (NCDDG). This system was demonstrated with obviously decreased toxicity and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ability compared to traditional Gd-DTPA. Meanwhile, NCDDG reserved the bright fluorescence of biocompatible carbon nanodots with increased spatial resolution. Attributed to small size and hydrophilic polymer coating, NCDDG was capable of overcoming the BBB and permeating leaky microvascular walls into surrounding glioma tissues via prolonged in vivo circulation and enhanced retention effect. As a result, dual(1)-modal targeted MR/fluorescence imaging of glioma was synergistically achieved with high sensitivity and resolution. This work promised a potential contrast agent for sensitive clinical diagnosis of glioma.

AB Intratumoral implants have aroused great interests for local chemotherapy of cancer, however, how to efficiently control drug release from implants is still a great challenge. Herein, we designed and prepared a new hollow bullet-shaped implant with porous surface by 3D printing, loaded chemotherapeutic agent cytoxan (CTX) with tetradecyl alcohol or lecithin as matrix and coated it with poly (lactic acid) to obtain a CTX implant, which has a highly tuned drug release property with a drug release time from 4 h to more than 1 month. The drug release from the implant can be easily controlled by changing pore sizes, kinds of matrices, and coating thickness.

AB The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of amphiphilic copolymer micelles on six major hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. A series of mPE(2k)-PCLx polymeric micelles (mPE(2k)-PCL2k, mPE(2k)-PCL3-5k, mPE(2k)-PCL5k and mPE(2k)-PCL10k) ranging from 20 to 100 nm were prepared to investigate the inhibitory or inductive activities by in vitro incubations of rat liver microsomes and primary rat hepatocytes. Inhibition of these polymeric micelles on CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2C6, CYP2C11, CYP2D2 and CYP3A1/2 isoenzymes were observed above their critical micelle concentrations (> 10 mu g.mL(-1)) and in a concentration-dependent manner. The mPE(2k)-PCL(2k )micelles showed the strongest inhibition of CYP1A2, followed by CYP2C11. The micelles with lower molecular weight PCL segment exhibited more potent inhibitory potential. Induction on CYP1A2, CYP2B1 and CYP3A1/2 activity (2.1-7.2-fold, 1.5-2.4-fold and 1.3-3.0-fold, respectively) were detected at all tested concentrations (0.1-1000 mu g.mL(-1) or 0.1-100 mu g.mL(-1)). Accordingly, most of the mRNA levels were upregulated. As demonstrated in ex vivo fluorescence imaging results, the mPE(2k)-PCLx micelles mainly accumulated in the liver after intravenous administration. In conclusion, mPE(2k)-PCLx micelles can interfere with the normal metabolic function of CYP450s in vitro, indicating polymeric micelles as promising drug nano-carriers might cause micelle-drug interaction and the in vivo interaction deserves further investigation.

AB Cytarabine (Ara-C) has become cornerstones for the treatment of haematological malignancies for several decades; however, it still faces serious challenges in clinical applications due to its side effects such as hand foot syndrome (HFS) and stomatitis. Therefore, considerable researchers have devoted to looking for the new derivative with desirable activity and low toxicity. A new prodrug based on the conjugation of cytarabine with lauric acid (LA-Ara) was synthesized in our group, and it could self-assemble into nanofibers (NFs) in aqueous solution with high drug loading (57 wt%). The lauric acid moiety protects NH2 group of from the enzymatic attachment and simultaneously raises the lipophilicity of Ara-C, thus obviously prolongs its plasma half-life. The oil/water partition coefficient (lg P) and the permeability of cell membrane of LA-Ara were obviously increased compared with Ara-C. Furthermore, the in vitro gastrointestinal stability results indicated the prodrug was suitable to be administrated orally. In the current study, the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anti breast cancer experimental results indicate LA-Ara markedly improved antitumor activity compared with free Ara-C. The favorable safety evaluations elucidated its potentiality for oral alternative treatment to Ara-C. Importantly, LA-Ara can effectively decrease the incidence of toxic effects (HFS and stomatitis) of Ara-C, thereby exhibiting favorable skin safety profile. Overall, these results indicated the LA-Ara would be an excellent candidate for further clinical investigation and simultaneously highlight the prospects of Ara-C prodrug strategies in solid tumors therapy.

AB In formulations of nanostructured lipid carriers, lipid solid dispersions and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, it is common that a solid or semi-solid lipid excipient is mixed with a liquid solvent or liquid lipid. Even when the excipients are visually miscible upon melting, they might have microscopic non-homogeneities which could lead to instability over time and future phase separation. Raman mapping associated with chemometric methods can be useful to evaluate spatial distribution of compounds, however it has not been extensively applied to the formulations mentioned above. The aim of this work was to compare the outcomes of three different chemometric methods - principal components analysis (PCA), multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) and independent components analysis (ICA) - to study two systems of very different degrees of microscopic miscibility: cetyl palmitate + Transcutol(C) (heterogeneous) and polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) + Tween 80(C) (homogeneous). These two samples were chosen due to large differences in spatial distribution of the compounds over the pixels which could require different approaches for data treatment. The three methods were compared regarding recovered concentrations (or scores), signals (or loadings) and the need for matrix augmentation to obtain reliable results. Results showed that PCA loadings were the mathematical differences of the spectra of pure compounds for both samples, and therefore only 'contrast images' could be generated. MCR and ICA provided signals that could be related to the chemical components, however MCR presented rotational ambiguities even for the very heterogeneous sample, a situation in which ICA performed better as a blind search method. For the homogeneous sample, both methods showed rank deficiency and therefore the use of a matrix augmentation was necessary. ICA and PCA allowed identifying physical modifications in the homogeneous semi-solid PEG 6000/Tween 80 sample over the time, probably due to the folding/unfolding of the crystalline chains of PEG 6000. Therefore, this work discusses the ability of the three chemometrics methods to extract information from Raman spectra in order to characterize the chemical, spatial and even physical aspects of semi-solid pharmaceutical formulations, which could be of much use for stability studies of different drug delivery systems.

AB Tobramycin (FOB) and clarithromycin (CLA) can potentially be used synergistically for the treatment of respiratory infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. This study aimed to develop a novel combination proliposome formulation (TOB/CLA-CPROLips) containing both hydrophilic TOB and hydrophobic CLA via a core-carrier approach. The combination proliposomes were produced by spray drying a suspension comprising spray-driedmannitol (SD-MAN, 0.45%) and spray-dried tobramycin (SDTOB, 0.05%) particles suspended in an ethanolic lipid solution of CLA (0.05%). The lipid layer coated on the surface of the dry proliposome particles conferred moisture protection and sustained drug release properties in comparison to the pure drugs. The optimized TOB/CLA-CPROLips formulation was stable after 3 months of storage at 60% relative humidity (RH) and 25 degrees C. The combination drug proliposomes showed a synergistic antimicrobial activity against planktonic cells and biofilm cultures of P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, the core-carrier method coupled with spray-drying provided a novel approach for the preparation of combination antibiotics proliposomes.

AB Ketoprofen, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, is widely used for relieving the pain and swelling caused by rheumatoid arthritis. However, ketoprofen can't suppress disease progression effectively. In this study, in an effort to improve the therapeutic effect for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), microRNA-124 (miR-124), a promising new therapeutic agent for RA, was co-loaded with ketoprofen into poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres and administrated to adjuvant-induced arthritis rats. PLGA microspheres loaded with ketoprofen and miR-124 were prepared by a modified multiple emulsion-solvent evaporation method. In vivo pharmacodynamics experimental results indicated ketoprofen in co-loaded microspheres could significantly reduce inflammation of the joints and miR-124 in the microspheres could reduce bone damage. In addition, ketoprofen and miR-124 co-loaded PLGA microspheres had a remarkable advanced activity over delivery of either miR-124 or ketoprofen in suppressing adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) in rats. Results of western blot and immunohistochemistry revealed that miR-124 could reduce the level of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL). These results suggested co-delivery of ketoprofen and miR-124 could achieve synergistic effects on preventing inflammation and bone damage caused by AA. Ketoprofen and miR-124 co-loaded PLGA microspheres could be a promising combined therapeutic strategy against RA.

AB Eliminating the infection from root canals and periodontal tissues of human teeth as well as the repair of infected periodontal bone has been a great challenge. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) particles have been used for drug delivery due to their biodegradability, sustained drug release and nontoxic properties. As silver ions (Ag+) exhibit strong antibacterial ability and calcium ions (Ca2+) are essential for hard tissue regeneration, the Ag+ and Ca2+ were encapsulated into the PLGA particles to form AgCa-PLGA submicron particles. The physicochemical properties, ion release, cytotoxicity, ability to infiltrate dentinal tubules, antibacterial effects against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) in either planktonic or biofilm forms on dentin as well as in vitro mineralization ability were investigated. Results showed that Ag+ and Ca2+ were encapsulated into the AgCa-PLGA particles, which could release both Ag+ and Ca2+ over 30 days and exhibited strong antibacterial effects against E. faecalis and P. gingivalis. AgCa-PLGA particles could infiltrate into dentinal tubules by ultrasonic activation and inhibit the colonization of E. faecalis and P. gingivalis on dentin. AgCa-PLGA particles showed no cytotoxicity and induced hydroxyapatite (HA)-like crystal formation. AgCa-PLGA submicron particles could become a biomaterial for both infection control and hard tissue regeneration in dentistry and other related medical areas.

AB Controlled drug delivery systems have been utilized to enhance the therapeutic effects of many drugs by delivering drugs in a time-dependent and sustained manner. Here, with the aid of 3D printing technology, drug delivery devices were fabricated and tested using a model drug (fluorophore: rhodamine B). Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) devices were fabricated using a two-photon polymerization (TPP) system and rhodamine B was homogenously entrapped inside the polymer matrix during photopolymerization. These devices were printed with varying porosity and morphology using varying printing parameters such as slicing and hatching distance. The effects of these variables on drug release kinetics were determined by evaluating device fluorescence over the course of one week. These PEGDMA-based structures were then investigated for toxicity and biocompatibility in vitro, where MTS assays were performed using a range of cell types including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Overall, tuning the hatching distance, slicing distance, and pore size of the fabricated devices modulated the rhodamine B release profile, in each case presumably due to resulting changes in the motility of the small molecule and its access to structure edges. In general, increased spacing provided higher drug release while smaller spacing resulted in some occlusion, preventing media infiltration and thus resulting in reduced fluorophore release. The devices had no cytotoxic effects on human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) or iPSCs. Thus, we have demonstrated the utility of two-photon polymerization to create biocompatible, complex miniature devices with fine details and tunable release of a model drug.

AB The multivariate nature of a fluidized bed system creates process complexity that increases the risk of production upset. This research explores the use of passive acoustic emissions monitoring paired with an artificial neural network to detect fluidized bed distributor plate blockage. In many cases, early process failure detection can allow for immediate intervention, thus lowering operation costs. Blockages were simulated by actively covering portions of a top-spray fluidized bed distributor plate. Piezoelectric microphones were placed within the fluidized bed exhaust and attached externally to the vessel wall. Several time and frequency domain feature vectors were extracted from the monitoring data using the open source pyAudioAnalysis library in Python. Through deep learning, the artificial neural network used these feature vectors to train against each distributor plate blockage condition. The deep learning model was then evaluated using k-fold cross validation. The findings were very positive and successfully demonstrated an application of deep learning to detect process upset.

AB Therapeutic efficacy of antifibrotic drugs can be improved by targeting hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). This study investigated the prospect of developing a carrier system for the effective delivery of hesperidin by selectively targeting HSCs in fibrotic rat model. Hesperidin-loaded surface modified liposome formulations were prepared with varying quantity of lipids to optimize physicochemical characteristics. Best liposome formulation was further conjugated with a homing ligand, recognized by HSCs, to achieve a carrier system that facilitates the targeting of hesperidin. This carrier system was characterized for various physicochemical properties. The effectiveness of the bioactive carrier to prevent liver fibrosis was investigated by carrying out biochemical, biodistribution, and histopathological analyses. The pharmaceutical properties demonstrated by the ligand conjugated carrier system were optimal to facilitate selective and preferential delivery to the liver. Steady and prolonged drug release behavior with zero order kinetics displayed by prepared carrier system established its prospect to increase efficiency and decrease dosing of hesperidin. The pharmacokinetic profile of the carrier system was very distinct and exhibited rapid plasma clearance. The bio-distribution data of formulated carrier system indicates higher uptake of hesperidin predominantly by fibrotic liver with insignificant amount in non-targeted organs, which is certainly beneficial due to low risk of toxicity and lower systemic distribution. In conclusion, this developed carrier represents a potentially beneficial approach for HSCs specific targeting of hesperidin in a rat model with liver fibrosis.

AB AP736 itself is a novel skin whitening agent reported to exhibit anti-melanogenic and tyrosinase inhibitory activity. However, formulating a topical product has been difficult because AP736 is insoluble in water as well as in many oils. In this study, we aimed to develop a new topical delivery system in which AP736 is not only physically stable, but also suitably delivered to the skin. By calculating each HSP (Hansen Solubility Parameters), ethylenedioxy moiety-containing compounds could be easily selected for the formulation ingredients of AP736. Although diethylene glycol monoethyl ether with the highest solubility of AP736 enalbes to make AP736-incorporated water-in-oil emulsions well, the recrystallization of AP736 was observed in oil-in-water emulsions. Therefore, we fabricated polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) in order to encapsulate AP736 to prevent its recrystallization. We used three different PEG-PCL polymers with various chain lengths and ethylenedioxy moiety-containing surfactants (i.e. Choleth) for fabricating PNP5. The prepared PNP5 had a mean particle size from 50 nm to 200 nm. Most of PNP5 showed the good encapsulation efficiency up to 90%. In particular, Choleth-24 had a significant role in encapsulating AP736 in PNP5. After encapsulation of AP736, no significant changes were observed in the sizes of tested PNP5 within 4 weeks. Further, the recrystallization of AP736 was not observed in oil-in-water emulsions after 24 weeks of storage at 40 degrees C. In vitro permeation study using Strat-M showed that PNP5 containing Choleth-24 has the faster release pattern compared to PNP5 using Tween 80 and saturated in D.I. water. These results are demonstrating that PNP5 might be an effective vehicle for stabilization in oil-in-water emulsions and topical application of AP736.

AB In this study, a novel antibacterial agent was developed based on chitin nanofibrous microspheres loaded with AgNPs and Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Ag-Fe3O4-NMs) for synergistic antibacterial activity and wound healing. Ag-Fe3O4-NMs was prepared via an in situ synthetic method which showed an excellent porosity and wettability. Moreover, Ag-Fe3O4-NMs were capable of sustained release of Ag+ and catalysed the decomposition of low H2O2 concentrations to generate hydroxyl radical (center dot OH). The center dot OH and Ag+ showed higher antibacterial activity and inhibited the toxicity with high dose of AgNPs and H2O2. In vitro biocompatibility results suggested that Ag-Fe3O4-NMs have low toxicity and low hemolysis. Thus, a novel antibacterial agent with enhanced synergistic antibacterial activity was obtained by combination of Ag-Fe3O4-NMs and H2O2 at a low and biologlically safe dosage, which could facilitate fibroblast growth, accelerate epithelialization, and promote the healing rate of infected wounds.

AB A vertical in-line continuous powder mixing device (CMT - Continuous Mixing Technology) has been modelled with the discrete element method (DEM) utilizing a calibrated cohesive contact model. The vertical design of the mixing device allows independent control of mean residence time (MRT) and shear rate. The hold-up mass and outlet flow are controlled by an exit valve, located at the bottom of the in-line mixer. A virtual design of experiments (DoE) of DEM simulations has been performed and parameters such as particle velocities, powder bed shape, residence time distribution (RTD), travel distance, and mixing quality are evaluated for the complete operating space. The RTD of the DEM model has been validated with tracer experiments. The resulting RTD has been fitted with an analytical form (generalized cascade of n continuous stirred tank reactors) and utilized to study the downstream response of the continuous mixing device to upstream fluctuations in the inlet material stream. The results indicate a high mixing quality and good filtering properties across the operating space. However, the combination of low hold-up mass and high impeller speeds leads to a reduced filtering capability and wider exit valve openings, indicating a less desirable operating point.

AB The advent of smart nanohydrogel has revealed new opportunities for scientists to develop the most efficient anti-cancer vehicles with safe and biocompatible profile. In this experiment, using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization method as a novel, safe and smart pH responsive formulation of poly (hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and poly (ethylene glycol)-diacrylate as cross-linker were synthesized. The synthesized structure was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The pH responsive behavior of the synthesized particles was checked by size measurement in two different pH values (5.5 and 7.4) by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The prepared structure had nanometer sizes of 180 in medium with pH of 7.4, when it encountered acidic medium (e.g. pH 5.5), the particles swelled to about 400 nm. The efficiency of the prepared pH responsive nanohydrogels was tested as a drug delivery system. An anti-cancer drug, doxorubicin successfully interacted with this material. The release profiles of nanoparticles carrying drug molecules were checked in two different simulated pH of healthy organs (7.4) and tumor site (5.5). Despite lower release in pH of 7.4 (similar to 20%), an increased drug release of 80% was obtained in pH of 5.5. The in vitro toxicity assay, apoptosis evaluation and uptake experiments were performed on breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), which showed a time dependency cellular entrance, an enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction by the doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles. Hemolysis assays confirmed the safety and hemocompatibility of the developed nanohydrogel. The suitable size (< 200 nm), pH responsive behavior, anti-proliferative activity and apoptosis induction in cancer cells and hemocompatibility were the noticeable features of the developed doxorubicin adsorbed nanoparticle, which introduced this formulation as an ideal vehicle in anti-cancer drug delivery.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibited high incidence rate worldwide and the advanced CRC had a poor prognosis. Thereupon, seeking efficient treatment for CRC is critical. Apatinib is a novel vascular epithelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor with inspiring therapeutic effect in some malignant cancers. In our study, doxorubicin was mixed in fibrin gel and apatinib was encapsulated with self-synthesized liposome. The results showed liposomal apatinib (Lipo-Apatinib) could enhance the intracellular uptake of doxorubicin in vitro. Moreover, compared with doxorubicin loaded fibrin gel (DOX-FG) alone, the combination of DOX-FG and Lipo-Apatinib significantly improved the anti-tumor effect in mice CRC subcutaneous model and abdominal metastasis model Drug combination successfully inhibited tumor angiogenesis and tumor proliferation, and also promoted tumor apoptosis. Our data suggested that combined therapy of DOX-FG and Lipo-Apatinib would be a promising treatment approach for CRC.

AB Once introduced into physiological environment, nanoparticles (NPs) are immediately coated with proteins, resulting in formation of what is known as protein corona. The formation of protein corona can be affected by many factors. Likewise, the addition of protein corona can alter the physicochemical properties and biodistribution of NPs. NPs with the coating protein corona can be considered as a biological identity that recognized by cells in biological system. Thus, to understand and regulate the effect of protein corona on targeting capability of NPs in vivo, it is necessary to elucidate the interaction between the NPs and the biological fluid. In this review, we first elucidate the factors influencing the formation of protein corona, including NPs physicochemical factors, such as NPs composition, size, shape, surface chemistry, etc., and environmental factors, such as environmental temperature, protein origins, etc. Then, we focus on the effect of protein corona on the passive targeting and active targeting, and discuss the probable reasons that causing the discrepant results. Finally, we review the strategies for tuning the protein corona to promote targeting, including reducing protein adsorption and recruiting specific proteins.

AB Wound healing can be a painful and time-consuming process in patients with diabetes mellitus. In light of this, the use of wound healing devices could help to accelerate this process. Here, cellulose-based films loaded with vitamin C (VitC) and/or propolis (Prop), two natural compounds with attractive properties were engineered. The starting materials and the cellulose-based films were characterized in detail. As assessed, vitamin C can be released from the Cel-PVA/VitC and Cel-PVA/VitC/Prop films in a controlled manner. In vitro antibacterial activity studies showed a reduction of bacteria counts (Escherichia coll. and Staphylococcus aureus) after Cel-PVA/VitC, Cel-PVA/Prop, and Cel-PVA/VitC/Prop treatments. Moreover, we examined the antibacterial and wound healing properties of the cellulose-based films in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic animal model. Diabetic mice exhibited impaired wound healing while the Cel-PVA/VitC/Prop treatment increased the wound closure. A marked reduction in bacterial counts present in the wound environment of diabetic mice was observed after Cel-PVA/VitC, Cel-PVA/Prop and Cel-PVA/VitC/Prop treatment. Histological analysis demonstrated that the non-treated diabetic mice group did not exhibit adequate wound healing while the treated group with Cel-PVA/VitC and Cel-PVA/VitC/Prop films presented good cicatricial response. Furthermore, these novel eco-friendly films may represent a new therapeutic approach to accelerate diabetic wound healing.

AB The chief objective of this research was to appraise liposomes embodying a bile salt, sodium glycocholate (SGC), as oral nanoscale drug delivery system to strengthen the bioavailability of a water-soluble and weakly penetrable pharmaceutical, notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1). NGR1-loaded liposomes were prepared with the improved supercritical reverse evaporation (ISCRPE) method and the preparation conditions were optimized with response surface methodology (RSM). The mean encapsulation efficiency (EE), particle size, and polydispersity index (PDI) of the optimized liposomal formulation (NGR1@Liposomes) were 49.49%, 308.3 nm, and 0.229, respectively. SGC-mediated liposomes (NGR1@SGC-Liposomes) were formulated based on the optimal preparation conditions and the mean EE, particle size, and PDI were 41.51%, 200.1 nm, and 0.130, respectively. The in vitro Caco-2 cellular uptake of fluorescent marker was increased by loading into NGR1@SGC-Liposomes as compared with the conventional liposomes. Furthermore, the intestinal permeability as well as the intestinal absorption of NGR1 were both significantly improved with NGR1@SGC-Liposomes as the nanovesicles. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study results showed that AUC(0-t) value of NGR1@SGC-Liposomes and NGR1@Liposomes was 2.68and 2.03-fold higher than that of NGR1 aqueous solution, respectively. The AUC(0-t) of the NGRl@SGC-Liposomes group was significantly higher than that of NGR1@Liposomes. Thus, ISCRPE method is a feasible method for the preparation of water-soluble drug-loaded liposomes and bile salt-mediated liposomes may enhance the oral absorption of water-soluble and poorly permeable drugs.

AB Galactosyltransferases are a family of enzymes responsible for the synthesis of glycan chains which are involved in cell proliferation, adhesion and apoptosis. A recently synthesized galactosyltransferase inhibitor, 2-naphthyl 2-butanamido-2-deoxy-1-thio-beta-D-glucopyranoside (612), has been found to selectively inhibit beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase over beta 1,3-galactosyltransferase and, therefore, has potential to suppress the synthesis of cancer associated epitopes. However, the application of this inhibitory activity in biological systems remains unknown. In this study, 612 was introduced into a cationic liposome (LP) delivery system, and the anti-proliferative effects of both free and the LP-incorporated 612 (612-LP) were investigated in A549 lung cancer cells, which actively express anionic sialic acid moieties on the surfaces of cells. The anti-proliferative effects were evaluated via MTT assays. The results revealed that free 612 and empty LP impose neither anti-proliferative nor apoptotic effects on cancer cells at low doses, whereas the 612-LP system inhibited cancer cell growth at a concentration as low as 0.1 mu g/mL after 3 days of incubation, suggesting that this formulation enabled efficient delivery of 612 into cells and promoted the anti-proliferative activity of 612 against cancer cells. Therefore, this highly specific inhibitor 612 has the potential for development as an effective anti-cancer agent and merits further investigation.

AB Milling is an important process for tailoring the particle size distribution for enhanced dissolution, content uniformity, tableting, etc., specially for active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipient in pharmaceutical industries. Milling performance of particulate solids depends on the equipment operating conditions (geometry, process conditions and input energy etc.) as well as material properties (particle size, shape, and mechanical properties, such as Young's modulus, hardness and fracture toughness). In this work, a newly developed approach to assess the breakability of pharmaceutical materials using an aerodynamic dispersion method has been combined with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to simulate the dynamic behaviour of a number of pharmaceutical materials in a pin mill. A sensitivity analysis is carried out addressing the effect of the milling conditions (rotational speed of the mill and feed particle flow rate) and feed properties on the milled products in terms of the shift in the specific surface area of the milled particles. The outcome of the work is used as a method to predict the breakage of the particles for the milling conditions where chipping takes place.

AB Basic amino acids (AAs) have successfully been used as co-formers with acidic drugs for the preparation of co-amorphous formulations using ball-milling (BM) and spray-drying (SD). In contrast, acidic AAs have been reported as poor co-formers for co-amorphous formulations, even for basic drugs, when using BM as a preparation technique. In this study the basic drug carvedilol (CAR) and the two acidic AAs, glutamic acid and aspartic acid, were used to explore the possibilities of producing co-amorphous formulations using BM, SD and liquid assisted grinding (LAG). X-ray powder diffraction, thermal analysis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were used to determine the solid state form of the various CAR-AA mixtures prepared. BM the CAR-AA mixtures for 60 min did not result in co-amorphization as XRPD revealed remaining crystallinity of both CAR and the AA. On the other hand, successful co-amorphous salt formation was obtained for all SD samples. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that all the SD CAR-AA mixtures had a single glass transition temperature of approximately 80 degrees C. The CAR-AA mixtures prepared by LAG showed some polymorphic conversion of CAR. Intrinsic dissolution testing showed the highest dissolution rate for all SD mixtures due to co-amorphous salt formation. Hence it was observed that of the three preparation techniques used, successful co-amorphous formulations of a basic drug with an acidic AA could only be prepared by SD.

AB Local delivery of viruses via nanomaterials has been demonstrated in the treatment of colon cancer. A cancer-favoring oncolytic vaccinia virus (CVV), which is an evolutionary cancer-favoring engineered vaccinia virus carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, has antitumor efficacy in drug-resistant colon cancer and metastatic liver cells. Here, we present the antitumor efficacy of a CVV coated a poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanofiber for local drug delivery in theranostic approaches. In vitro- and in vivo-based analyses using mouse colon carcinoma models confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of CVV-PLGA nanofibers through diagnostic localization of the tumors and reduced tumor burden as a result of enhanced apoptosis. We propose that the CVV-PLGA nanofiber may be used for theranostic purposes in cancer therapy.

AB The present study aimed to develop a celecoxib (CEL) nanoparticle with improved dissolution/dispersion and consistent absorption even in the presence of impaired gastric motility. CEL was pulverized by a wet-milling with hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), and the prepared nanoparticles were physicochemically characterized after freeze-drying. CEL nanoparticle with HPC-SSL (NP/CEL) exhibited better dissolution/dispersion behavior in pH1.2 solution compared with CEL nanoparticles with other polymers, as evidenced by a 21.8-fold higher initial dissolution/dispersion rate than crystalline CEL. The mean particle diameter of water suspended-NP/CEL was 250 nm, and the CEL nanoparticle existed in an amorphous state. Even after storage at 40 degrees C for 4 weeks, there were no significant changes in the dissolution/dispersion behavior. Oral absorption of CEL samples (5 mg-CEL/kg) was evaluated in normal and propantheline (PPT)-treated rats with simulated gastric motility impairment. In PPT-treated rats, oral crystalline CEL led to a decrease in oral absorption by 12% of the AUC(0-)(4) compared with that in normal rats, whereas NP/CEL suppressed the pharmacokinetic transition of CEL by 43% of the AUC(0-)(4) due to the improved dissolution/dispersion behavior of CEL. The NP/CEL system might be promising to avoid decreased absorption of CEL caused by impaired gastric motility.

AB Three decades after the discovery of cold seep systems, various sites of hydrocarbon seepage have been found in the South China Sea (SCS). Over the past decade, these sites have become model systems for understanding the variability of hydrocarbon seepage and associated biogeochemical processes. In this review, we describe the cold seep systems of the SCS with an emphasis on seafloor manifestations, fluid sources, biogeochemical processes, and macroecology. Seafloor features associated with seeps include mud volcanoes, pockmarks, and carbonate deposits. A common characteristic of cold seeps is the occurrence of authigenic (i.e., in situ precipitated) carbonate minerals. These carbonates commonly exhibit low delta C-13 and high delta O-18 values, suggesting the incorporation of methane-derived carbon and oxygen derived from gas hydrate water. Biogeochemical processes such as sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (SD-AOM), the key process at seeps, have been studied in detail with the aim of establishing geochemical proxies to trace these processes into the geological past. We also detail the features characterizing seep ecosystems. Understanding the impact of decomposing methane hydrate on the marine carbon budget remains challenging and requires additional seafloor observations as well as models predicting how gas hydrate responds to changing conditions such as temperature increase, sea level rise, and episodic mass wasting.

AB The active Haima cold seep sites were discovered by the remotely operated vehicle on the western part of the northern slope of South China Sea in 2015 and 2016. However, the subsurface structures in the seep area are not well studied, which prevents the further understanding of the evolution of fluid venting system in the active cold seep area. In 2017, a high-resolution 2D seismic line transecting the two main seep sites was acquired and processed. In this study, the subsurface structures were well resolved on the seismic profile. The new observations include the widespread subsurface fluid flow features (i.e., chimney structures and pockmarks) and the pervasively distributed magmatic activities. Seismic indicators for hydrothermal vents were also observed on the seismic section. This new discovery confirms the contribution of magmatic activities to the evolution of subsurface fluid flow in the study area. Minor faults under the recognizable resolution of seismic profile, which can act as conduits for the subsurface fluid flow, were also identified in the fine-grained sediment sequences. Overall, these results provide new insights into the evolution of subsurface fluid flow in the study area.

AB Seafloor features, seismic amplitude anomaly, geophysical attributes, and chemosynthetic community are different in the methane seepage areas of Taixinan Basin, South China Sea. We integrate the new acquired seafloor images with seismic data to present the differences of three cold seeps which are associated with fluid flows. These three cold seeps include two inactive sites (CS02-8 and CS02-9) and one active site (Site F). At site CS02-8 area, the seafloor carbonate and buried carbonate layer are identified from core samples at Site GMGS2-08. BSR is interrupted by the upward migration of fluids from the base of gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ) and gas hydrate-bearing sediments show pull-up seismic reflections below the buried carbonate layer. At site CS02-9 area, near seafloor carbonate was found at hole GMGS2-09B where a 62 m-high pinnacle and gas hydrate were also found from the core samples. The LWD data at hole 09A indicate that free gas is present below the depth of 64 m without gas hydrate. The average saturations of free gas estimated from P-wave velocity are about 3% with a patchy distribution and 0.3% with homogenous distribution respectively, which is accord with the enhanced reflection below BGHSZ. At Site F area, the exposed gas hydrate, carbonate and flourishing chemosynthetic communities are detected using ROV with a high amplitude seismic reflection at seafloor. The BSR is interrupted by a chimney structure from the seismic data which indicates that the fluids are migrating vertically and rise to the seafloor as gas bubbles. The geophysical evidence at these three seep sites show that pore-filling gas hydrates with saturations ranging from 10% to 40% are widely distributed above the BSR. However, massive or vein gas hydrates only occur around cold seeps.

AB Mega-pockmarks, which can reach a few kilometers in width and a few hundred meters in depth, and associated fluid escape features in the Northern Zhongjiannan Basin, South China Sea, have received much attention in the recent years, due to their large variety of morphologies and sizes. In this work, an integrated interpretation of detailed multibeam bathymetry, conventional multi-channel seismic reflection and seismic oceanography sections covering the northern Zhongjiannan Basin, South China Sea, are used to image the seafloor morphology, the subsurface geology and the water column, in order to better understand the geological and oceanographic controls on the formation and evolution of the widespread fluid escape features in this region. Regional uplift and volcanism took place in this area near the Palaeogene Neogene boundary and, during the Neogene Quaternary post-rift thermal subsidence period, differential subsidence and diapirism deformed the overlying kilometer-scale successions. Mainly after the Miocene, focused flow of fluids originated at depth occurred along gas pipes, polygonal faults, tapered reflectors and faults into the shallow sediments, resulting in intense fluid blowouts and complex fluid escape structures on the seafloor. Our results show that elongated pockmarks, pockmark gullies and gullies in the northern slope are generally controlled by underlying buried channels and gullies. However, pockmark gullies and gullies in the southern slope are controlled by gravity sliding/slumping, along with crescent pockmarks developing parallel to water depth contours. To varying degrees, intense fluid escape activities associated with mud diapirism and gas escape in the study area resulted in mud extrusion and the formation of mud volcanoes, complex seabed morphologies and irregular pockmarks. Mega-pockmarks, collapse structures and blind valleys have formed at the apexes of tectonic uplifts related to volcanism and above basement highs, which suggests that these processes played a role in creating pathways for fluid escape. Bottom currents associated with the South China Sea Western Boundary Current, imaged here for the first time with the seismic oceanographic method, mainly flow to the south, and erode the seafloor, making pockmark walls and slopes of gullies and channels in the north steeper than those in the south. Some fluid escape structures, such as the mega-pockmarks and pockmark gullies, are buried by sediment transported by the bottom currents. Turbidity currents flowing downslope along the long pockmark gullies also erode the seafloor and make the NW slopes of the mud volcanoes less steep than those in the SE. Eddies imaged by the seismic sections may also play a role in transporting sediment to the deep sea in this area. Some of the reported fluid escape structures are still active, as indicated by the fluid pathways that reach the seafloor and plumes in the water column imaged by the seismic sections.

AB Methane hydrate has been confirmed to be present in the South China Sea (SCS) based on drilling expeditions and geophysical indications. It is necessary to access the methane hydrate inventory because of its role in the energy resources and climate change. The aim of this study is to constrain the inventory of methane hydrates in the SCS formed by the microbial degradation of organic matter within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). Bathymetry, seafloor temperature, and geothermal gradient datasets enabled us to estimate the GHSZ at a resolution of 30 '' x 30 '' for the SCS. We conclude that the GHSZ occurs at water depths of > 500 m in most areas of the SCS. The methane hydrate distribution formed by microbial methane production in the SCS was computed using the parameterized transfer function recently proposed by Wallmann et al. (2012). The result indicates widespread accumulations of methane hydrate along the continental slopes in the SCS. The microbial methane hydrate is distributed over a 7.69 x 10(11) m(2) area and the total abundance of methane hydrate in the SCS is estimated to be 42.8 Gt C.

AB Two-dimensional gas hydrate petroleum system modeling was conducted to understand gas hydrate accumulation mechanisms and spatial distribution related to geologic and geochemical processes in the first experimental gas hydrate exploitation region in the Shenhu area of the South China Sea. Based on the gas production in core samples, a new biogenic methane generation model was created and incorporated into a kinetic model. With the results of a rock pyrolysis experiment, a thermogenic gas kinetic model for deep formations in the study area was also developed. The entire dynamic evolution process from gas generation to migration and gas hydrate formation and accumulation in the perspective area was simulated with the petroleum system modeling method. The results showed that the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) began to form after 3.88 Ma, and its thickness was greatest when the paleowater depth peaked at 3.66 Ma. The mass of thermogenic gas generation in deep formations is large, and that of biogenic gas in shallow formations is relatively small. Formations that overlap the gas hydrate bearing layers act as cap rocks that prevent the gas from migrating vertically to shallow layers. There was a geological time gap between thermogenic gas generation, migration and GHSZ formation. However, the timing of biogenic gas generation, which is typically of recent generation in the shallow layer, matched well with the formation of the GHSZ. Finally, coupling of the age and space of gas migration and GHSZ formation has allowed gas hydrate accumulation at structural highs in the Shenhu area. The evaluation technique of petroleum system modeling is of great significance for the improvement of gas hydrate exploration in frontier areas in the future, particularly where survey data are limited.

AB Several tens of methane (CH4) seepage sites have been discovered in the northern South China Sea (SCS) during the investigation and exploration of gas hydrates and cold seeps over the past decade. However, our knowledge about methane seepage in the southern SCS remains scarce, especially in the Beikang Basin on the southern slope of the SCS. Four piston cores (BH-CL18, BH-CL23, BH-CL29 and BH-CL35) were collected in the Beikang Basin to understand CH4 cycling in shallow sediments. The extrapolated depths of the sulfate-methane transition zones (SMTZ) of the four cores are between 5.3 and 8.8 mbsf. By simulating the porewater profiles of SO42-, CH4, DIC and PO43- using the reaction-transport model, we estimated that the dissolved SO42- was predominantly consumed by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at rates of 27.5 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) in BH-CL18, 28.1 mmol M-2 yr(-1) in BH-CL23, 43.1 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) in BH-CL29 and 39.4 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) in BH-CL35, respectively. Due to intense AOM, almost all the methane sourced from subsurface sediments was depleted within the SMTZ, resulting in negligible benthic methane fluxes. The kink-type depth SO42- profile of BH-CL23 was apparently attributable to an enhanced methane flux, which was not captured by the steady-state modelling. Furthermore, highly depleted delta C-13 values of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in BH-CL18 (-43.6%o), BH-CL23 (-44960) and BH-CL29 (- 51.2%0) also indicated a methane-derived DIC. In contrast, relatively higher delta C-13 values in BH-CL35 suggested a mixture of C-13-enriched DIC produced by methanogenesis, as shown by the reversal toward more C-13-enriched DIC below 4.2 mbsf in BH-CL29. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study dealing with methane cycling in the shallow sediments of the southern SCS and may have considerable implications for understanding the poorly investigated cold seep and gas hydrate systems on the continental slope of the southern SCS.

AB Methane of various origins is widespread in the sediments of continental margins, representing a key component of the carbon cycle in the ocean. Its occurrence in shallow marine sediments can be linked to the gas hydrate reservoir in the deep sedimentary column. However, this type of methane is difficult to track due to complex reactions occurred during its long distance migration. Porewater geochemical analyses of two similar to 7 m piston cores (D17-15 and W01-16) combined with a reaction-transport model were applied to quantify methane-related biogeochemical processes and to explore the linkage of shallow methane to gas hydrate reservoir in the hydrate drilling areas of Shenhu and Dongsha in the South China Sea (SCS). The model results revealed that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is the predominant biogeochemical process in both cores, consuming approximately 85% and 74% of sulfate in the modeled domain, respectively. The crossplot of dissolve inorganic carbon (DIC) accumulation versus sulfate depletion of the system suggests that methane consumed during the AOM is mainly originated from external methane sources rather than local methanogenesis. Using a delta C-13(DIC) mass balance calculation together with model-derived fractions of different DIC sources, we estimated that the delta C-13 value of the external methane in core D17-15 is -66.6%o, which is in accordance with the previous reported delta C-13 values of hydrate-bound methane in the area. These results suggest that methane consumed in shallow sediments in the hydrate drilling areas of the SCS is mainly originated from local gas hydrate reservoir. The proposed approach has the potential to be used to differentiate the sources of methane, which will provide constraints on dynamics of methane in gas hydrate-bearing marine sediments.

AB Authigenic carbonates and pyrite associated with sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at methane seeps provide archives to explore the biogeochemical processes involved and seepage dynamics over time. The wide range and extremely high delta S-34 values of pyrite (delta S-34(py)) have been used to trace the AOM-related processes. However, the detailed mechanism for this phenomenon is not well understood. We propose that the characteristics of delta S-34(py) were mainly controlled by the competition between sulfate reduction and sulfate supply, as well as the redox condition. To test this hypothesis, we investigated Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios, trace element compositions, pyrite contents and sulfur isotopic compositions in seep carbonates from Site F and Haima in the northern South China Sea. Calcite and aragonite contents were distinguished through the Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios. The data show that aragonites are always associated with relatively low delta S-34(py) values compared to calcites. The Mo contents show a good correlation with pyrite contents in calcites and aragonites, and the slope in aragonites is larger than that in calcites. This relationship indicates that the aragonite precipitated in a relatively open system with higher Mo availability. Thus, we conclude that sulfides with low delta S-34 values formed at high supply of sulfate under the relatively open system with respect to diffusive replenishment of sulfate, where the carbonate precipitation occurred close to the seafloor due to a strong methane flux. Under vigorous methane flux simultaneously, the high potential of less anoxic conditions, which could limit the additional pyrite accumulation and/or favor the microbial disproportionation, could also be the cause of the low delta S-34(py), as supported by samples from the Haima sites. Evidence for this assumption is based on the occurrence of bivalve shells and less enrichment in As and Sb. Conversely, the positive delta S-34(py) values result from near to complete exhaustion of dissolve sulfate via AOM within a deeper sulfate-methane transition zone, where Mo is less available. The combination of a detailed elemental study of authigenic carbonates with sulfur isotopic composition of sulfide minerals in carbonates is a promising tool for reconstructing the dynamics of seep intensities at modern and, potentially, geological seep sites.

AB Over the past decade more than 30 cold seep sites have been reported along the continental slope of the South China Sea (SCS). These seep sites have all been located in the northern SCS, and no methane seepage has been discovered in the southern SCS. Here, we report on the analysis results of the geochemical and geophysical of the marine core sediments (58S) collected from the southern continental slope of the SCS. We suggest that the sedimentary total sulfur (TS), total inorganic carbon (TIC), delta S-34(CRs) values of chromium reducible sulfur (CRS) and carbonate delta C-13(TIC) values of the bulk sediments, coupled with the ratio of (NRMAF60mT-NRMAF80mT)/NRM can be used to trace the methane release events in a methane-rich environment. At least two methane release events were identified at depths of 5.5-6.2 m and 6.8-7.2 m. Moreover, according to the characteristic of the TS/TOC and (NRMAF60mT-NRMAF80mT)/NFtM ratio of sediments, we suggest the methane flux has changed episodically. This inference is supported by the occurrence of the strongly negative carbonate delta C-13(TiC) values of bulk sediments and the positive delta S-34(CRS) values, which indicate the occurrence of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and the location of a past or present sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ), respectively. Ultimately, these new data suggest that the combined geochemical and geophysical study of marine sediments provides a valuable tool with which to infer the temporal variations in methane seepage in a marine environment.

AB Authigenic pyrite is a common mineral in seepage areas, where it is mainly derived from sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (SO4-AOM). However, reports on the iron isotopic composition of SO4-AOM generated pyrite are limited, and the mechanisms controlling the fractionation of iron isotopes are insufficiently understood. Here, we present new iron isotope data for pyrite and iron oxides from sediments of the Taixinan seepage and gas hydrate-bearing area (sites HD109 and GMGS2-16) and revisit published data for pyrite from the Shenhu area to unravel the impact of SO4-AOM on the iron isotope composition of pyrite. The delta Fe-56 values (relative to average igneous rock) of pyrite were found to vary from -0.86 to -0.56%o for site HD109, and from -1.57 to -0.25%0 for site GMGS2-16. In contrast, the iron isotopic compositions of iron oxides from site GMGS2-16 reveal positive values throughout the core, spanning from +0.52%o to +0.74960. In addition, the extent of pyritization (Fe-py/Fe-HR) of the sediment was investigated, revealing a variability between 0.01 and 0.29 for HD109, and between 0.00 and 0.36 for GMGS2-16. A previous study on the Shenhu seepage area recognized an enrichment of Fe-56 in pyrite at (paleo-)sulfate-methane transition zones (SMTZ), which was regarded as a consequence of pronounced SO4-AOM. However, peaks in delta Fe-56(py) values are not observed at (paleo-) SMTZs at sites HD109 and GMGS2-16 in this study. The negative delta Fe-56(py) values are likely to reflect the dominance of dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) during diagenesis in this area. In addition, for all samples of the Taixinan and Shenhu areas, their delta Fe-56(py) values, and the extent of pyritization, a clear positive correlation becomes apparent, where both delta Fe-56(py), values and Fe-py/Fe-HR ratios from the Taixinan area are lower. Hence, it can be inferred that the availability of sulfide is among the key factors that affect the iron isotopic composition of pyrite. With respect to the Taixinan area, the low degree of pyritization was apparently insufficient to alter the iron isotopic composition of the iron sources (i.e., iron oxides) to a significant degree.

AB Anomalously low delta C-13 values of foraminifera in the stratigraphy are usually interpreted to reflect activities of paleo-methane seepage. The application of this proxy, however, requires to understand the cause of anomalously low delta C-13 signals in foraminifera. Here we present stable carbon and oxygen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta O-18), Mg/Ca ratios and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon data from Cores GMGS2-08B (similar to 0-5.5 m below the seafloor [mbsf]) and 08C (2-23 mbsf) at similar to 798m water depth, recovered from the gas hydrate-bearing sediments in the northeastern South China Sea (SCS). The main objectives are to investigate the primary versus secondary signals of extremely negative delta C-13 values of foraminifera and further recognize the methane emission events (MEEs). The delta C-13 values of benthic (Uvigerina peregrine and Cibicidoides spp.) and planktonic (Globigerinoides ruber and Pulleniatina obliquiloculata) foraminifera in these two cores show distinct intervals with negative values (as low as -15.85 parts per thousand) that indicate the shift of the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ) and the change in methane release flux in the past. The delta C-13 records of U. peregrine by a more exhaustive cleaning procedure designed to remove authigenic carbonate coatings show that most delta C-13 values are still lower relative to those in the normal marine environment. The Mg/Ca ratios of Uvigerina spp. by this exhaustive cleaning procedure display higher values and more variable for anomalous tests (as high as 13.40 mmol/mol) than normal ones. These observations indicate the C-13-depleted signals of foraminifera are mainly originated from diagenetic alteration of authigenic carbonate precipitates with extremely negative delta C-13 values. Furthermore, the mass -balance approach is adopted to assess the relative contribution of methane-derived authigenic carbonate in the low-delta C-13 signals in foraminifera and reveals the maximum contribution can be as high as similar to 30% among the delta C-13 anomalies. Additionally, several major MEEs with distinct characteristics can be recognized according to remarkable delta C-13 excursions of foraminifera in these two cores.

AB Cold seeps frequently occur at the seafloor along continental margins. The dominant biogeochemical processes at cold seeps are the combined anaerobic oxidation of methane and sulfate reduction, which can significantly impact the global carbon and sulfur cycles. The circulation of methane-rich fluids at margins is highly variable in time and space, and assessing past seepage activity requires the use of specific geochemical markers. In this study, we report multiple sedimentary proxy records for three piston gravity cores (QDN-14A, QDN-14B, and QDN-31) from the Haima seep of the South China Sea (SCS). By combining total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulfur (TS), acid insoluble carbon and sulfur isotope (delta C-13(organic) carbon and delta S-34(acid-insoluble)), and delta S-34 values of chromium reducibility sulfur (delta S-34(CRS)), as well as carbon isotopes of TIC (delta C-13(TIC)) in sediments, our aim was to provide constraints on methane seepage dynamics in this area. We identified three sediment layers at about 260-300 cm, 380-420 cm and 480-520 cm sediment depth, characterized by particular anomalies of low delta C-13(TIC) values and high TS content, high TS and CRS contents, and high delta S-34(acid-insoluble) and delta S-34(CRS) values, respectively. On this basis, we propose that these sediment horizons correspond to distinct methane release events preserved in the sediment record. While the exact mechanisms accounting for the presence (or absence) of these particular geochemical signals in the sediment are not known, we propose that they correspond to variations in methane flux and their duration through time. Overall, our results suggest that sedimentary carbon and sulfur and their isotopes are useful tracers for better understanding of methane seepage dynamics over time.

AB A 1375-cm-long gravity core (Site 973-4) was acquired from the Dongsha cold seep area of the northeastern South China Sea (SCS). We measured its stable isotopes of planktonic foraminifera and investigated benthic foraminiferal assemblage compositions. Accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 analysis of planktonic foraminifera shows that some intervals are dated to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. Pulleniatina obliquiloculata has positive delta C-13 (0.25-1.25 parts per thousand) except for a negative carbon isotopic excursion (up to delta C-13 = 1.15 parts per thousand), but its light -carbon sources remain elusive. The benthic delta C-13 values (Uvigerina) of non -seep and cold-seep boreholes from the SCS have no systematic difference. Therefore, the benthic delta C-13 at Site 973-4 did not record the enhanced seepage activities (if occurred) during the last sea-level lowstand in the Dongsha area. In the pre-Holocene sediments, the foraminiferal assemblages have lower diversities, Shannon-Wiener indices, evenness indices, Simpson indices and higher calcareous proportions like typical cold-seep settings. The changes in oxygen levels (lower in the glacial period than those in the Holocene) indicated by foraminiferal indices reflect either bottom-water oxygen variations on the glacial-interglacial scale or enhanced seepage activities during the last glacial period.

AB The hydrocarbons in sedimentary organic matter (OM) at Site 4B in the Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB), northern South China Sea (SCS) were analyzed. The odd/even predominance (OEP) of long chain n-alkanes (> n-C-24) with CPI (carbon preference index) values from 1.62 to 3.80 and n-C-29/n-C-31 being the two most abundant in most of the samples are strongly indicative of a terrestrial higher plant source, and the even/odd predominance (EOP) distribution of mid-chain n-alkanes (n-C16-22) suggests a marine bacterial input, probably chemical autotrophic bacteria. However, the biomarker distributions at the 65-70 cm, 80-85 cm and 85-90 cm intervals show a similar to those of crude oils, which were characterized by a dominance of an unresolved complex mixture (UCM) in the n-C20+ region, low CPI values (< 1.5) of long chain n-alkanes, low values of beta beta/(alpha beta + beta beta + beta alpha)-C-30 hopane (< 0.15), and high values (> 9) of total tricyclic terpanes/alpha beta-C-30 hopane. These features are typical characteristics of mature OM that has experienced catagenesis and metagenesis, suggesting that outside hydrocarbons migrated into these three intervals. In terms of petroleum systems developed in the PRMB, hydrocarbon seepage from deep source rocks via a diaper structure and fault system is proposed to be responsible for the occurrence of this mature OM.

TI Lipid biomarker patterns of authigenic carbonates reveal fluid

AB Authigenic carbonates retrieved from sites ROV1 and ROV2 of the Haima hydrocarbon seeps of the South China Sea at approximately 1390 m water depth were studied using lipid biomarker analyses. Abundant molecular fossils of anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) with strong C-13-depletions (delta C-13 values as low as 126 parts per thousand), in combination with low delta C-13(carbonate) values (-42.7 parts per thousand to -36.8 parts per thousand), provide evidence that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) was the major process driving the precipitation of the studied seep carbonates. The extremely low delta C-13 values of archaeal biomarkers confirm that biogenic methane was the main carbon source, but the seepage of accessory crude oil is also suggested by the presence of unresolved complex mixtures in the hydrocarbon fractions. A suite of C-13-depleted biomarkers indicate the predominance of ANME-1/DSS consortia at both sites, which indicates that the studied carbonates formed during low to medium methane flux. Somewhat higher contents of archaeal biomarkers and their stronger C-13-depletion at site ROV2 probably reflect at least temporarily higher seepage intensities than at site ROV1. Abundant bacterial dialkyl glycerol diethers (DAGEs), revealing a large offset of their delta C-13 values compared to SRB-derived terminally branched fatty acids, were possibly produced by distinct SRB species other than members of the DSS cluster. The encountered hopanoids are attributed to aerobic methanotrophic bacteria based on their moderate C-13-depletion. The application of molecular fossils in combination with their compound-specific isotope signatures is an efficient tool to reconstruct the composition of seepage fluids and seepage intensities.

AB Methane-derived carbonates with blocky and chimney morphologies were collected on the northern slope of the South China Sea. The studies of petrography, geochemistry and chronology show that the blocky carbonate has a microcrystalline structure with numerous of biogenic tests, whereas the carbonate chimney has a cryptocrystalline structure with scarce biogenic tests. Aragonite can be detected in the carbonate chimney, which indicates that it formed at the shallow sediments or on the seafloor. The delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of the blocky carbonate range from -46.8 parts per thousand to -28.8 parts per thousand VPDB and 2.2 parts per thousand to 3.5 parts per thousand VPDB, respectively. The delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of the carbonate chimney range from -45.0 parts per thousand to -22.9 parts per thousand VPDB and -2.8 parts per thousand to 3.1 parts per thousand VPDB, respectively. The carbon isotopic values indicate that these carbonates are related to the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). The oxygen isotopic values show that the gas hydrate dissociation contributed the (18)o-enrich fluid to a certain degree during the authigenic carbonate formation. According to the rare earth element results, the carbonate chimney precipitated in stable anoxic conditions. Because of the La-enriched influence, the formation environment of the blocky carbonate is ambiguous. The U/Th chronology results indicate that these authigenic carbonates precipitated during the last glacial period (primarily Marine Isotopic Stage 3) of low sea level stand.

AB Hydrocarbon-seep carbonates were discovered to be hosted within Miocene marine mudstone in the central Western Foothills near the Kuohsing area, Central Taiwan. Here, we present field observations, petrography, mineralogy, stable carbon isotope data, as well as rare earth element compositions. We evaluate the role of diagenetic alteration on the Kuohsing seep carbonates and constrain their fluid sources and formation conditions. Four main morphologies in the field were observed, including cylindrical columns, massive forms, lenticular nodules, and stratiform bodies. Petrographically, the carbonates are predominantly composed of partially recrystallized calcite and dolomite, with abundant amounts of biogenic detritus, pyrite aggregations and unidentified filaments. Isotopic analyses show that carbon isotope values inversely vary with oxygen isotope values, indicating substantial modification of the carbon isotope compositions of the carbonates by diagenetic processes. Extremely negative delta C-13 values as low as -47.6 parts per thousand recognized as a near-primary isotopic signature recorded in the carbonates, an end member of the trend, reveals that methane was incorporated during the carbonate precipitation. On the other hand, the carbonates have well preserved primary REE compositions, exhibiting MREE enrichment, no La and Ce anomalies, and supra-chondritic Y/Ho ratios. These REE patterns suggest that the Kuohsing authigenic carbonates were precipitated from reducing seep fluids with limited admixture of seawater.

AB Properties of gas hydrate are commonly investigated in laboratory by simulators or studied using the hydrate samples recovered from permafrost and marine sediments. Here synthetic gas hydrate (SGH) is quickly formed for the first time by fluids and bubbles erupted from the active cold seeps at the Formosa Ridge in the South China Sea (SCS). SGH samples are in situ detected by a Raman insertion probe for gas hydrate (RiP-Gh) which is deployed by the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Faxian. Both spatial and temporal in situ Raman spectra of the SGH samples are acquired in order to determine the structure and the evolution of the synthetic gas hydrate. Authigenic carbonate debris or other debris serving as nucleation particles, which is found in the in situ Raman spectra of SGH samples for the first time, may be one factor that can promote the formation of synthetic gas hydrate. The gas-water interface demonstrated by the observation results, also contributes to the quick formation of SGH samples, which agrees well with the previous study. In situ Raman spectra of three SGH samples which have been placed on the seafloor for 0 h, 4 h and 21 h respectively are acquired. Laboratory Raman spectra of one sample which has been surprisingly found and recovered after 9840 h (410 days) since formed on the seafloor are also acquired. The Raman spectra of the four SGH samples indicate that the methane large-to-small cage occupancy ratios of the hydrates vary from 1.01 to 1.39, and the ratios of methane large-to-gas of the hydrates increase from 0.53 to 1.55. Overall, our work suggests a new explanation for the quick formation of gas hydrate compared to that in laboratory simulation work, and reveals the evolution of synthetic gas hydrate after quick formation, which provides a new insight for the study of natural gas hydrate.

AB Laser Raman spectroscopy has been successfully applied for the in situ detection of gases and liquids, but has not yet been extensively applied to rocks in the deep sea. Authigenic carbonate rocks are widely distributed at the Formosa Ridge (Site F) and the eastern region of the Pear River Mouth basin (Site P) in the South China Sea (SCS). Considerable Raman spectral information on authigenic carbonates was obtained from laboratory measurements of slices of authigenic carbonate, direct measurements in a simulation environment, and in situ measurements in the deep sea. The dominant band of authigenic carbonate from Site F ranges from 1084 to 1087 cm(-1) while the dominant band from Site P ranges from 1088 to 1091 cm(-1), suggesting that compositional differences exist between the samples from the two cold seep areas. The results of the point-counting method indicates that the aragonite content in Site F is higher than that at Site P. The wider peak width of the aragonites at Site P shows the aragonites at Site P have lower degree of crystallinity, which suggests that aragonite is likely to be destroyed when the cold seep weakens or dies. The above information obtained via the Raman spectroscopy can guide sample collection in the deep sea and can be used in conjunction with other analysis methods to better understand environmental changes or the geological processes.

AB We consider a new prototype problem in domain decomposition with the solution in one domain governed by a known partial differential equation (PDE) whereas the solution in an adjacent domain is reconstructed by information gathered from distributed sensors (data) of variable fidelity. The PDE-domain and the Data-domain are tightly coupled, as the PDE solution is driven by the collected data, while the information gathered from its associated sensors is influenced by the PDE solution. Our overall methodology is based on the Schwarz alternating method and on recent advances in Gaussian process regression (GPR) using multi-fidelity data. The effectiveness of the proposed domain decomposition algorithm is demonstrated by examples of Helmholtz equations in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) domains.

AB In this paper, we construct an improved well-balanced positivity preserving central-upwind scheme for the two-dimensional Saint-Venant system of shallow water equations. As in Bryson et al. (2011) [7], our scheme is based on a continuous piecewise linear discretization of the bottom topography over an unstructured triangular grid. The main new technique is a special reconstruction of the water surface in partially flooded cells. This reconstruction is an extension of the one-dimensional wet/dry reconstruction from Bollermann et al. (2013) [3]. The positivity of the computed water depth is enforced using the "draining" time-step technique introduced in Bollermann et al. (2011) [4]. The performance of the proposed central-upwind scheme is tested on a number of numerical experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An interface-preserving level set method that solves advection and re-initialization equations for simulating three-dimensional dam-break flows is developed. This method solves mass transfer problems on a uniform staggered Cartesian grid. The advection equation that is used to advect the level set function for capturing the interface is discretized by a proposed fourth-order spatial discretization scheme. This scheme is dispersion-relation-preserving and is compact-reconstruction weighted essentially nonoscillatory (DRP-CRWENO4). This scheme is compared with a previous fifth-order, weighted, essentially non-oscillatory (WENO5) scheme and can represent an interface more accurately, while exactly preserving mass conservation. This level set approach introduces a mass correction term into the re-initialization equation based on local interface-preserving conditions. An explicit Adams-Bashforth algorithm on a staggered Eulerian grid is used for the Navier-Stokes solver. The point successive over-relaxation method is then employed to solve the resulting linear system. Two one-dimensional wave propagation problems are simulated to verify the proposed DRP-CRWENO4 scheme, which is shown to be capable of effectively capturing large gradients with fourth-order accuracy. To demonstrate their resolution, the two advection schemes (WENO5 and DRP-CRWENO4) are applied in two two-dimensional benchmark cases, i.e., a vortex deforming problem and Zalesak's disk problem, where simulation results of both schemes are compared against each other. Demonstration study is then further extended to three-dimensional cases of the vortex deforming problem and Zalesak's sphere problem, and simulation results agree well with those using hybrid particle level set method. Finally, several dam-break problems with and without obstacles are investigated to validate the coupled two-phase incompressible flow and level set method solver. The results for the predicted flow structure and mass conservation properties are compared with the reported experimental data or numerical simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The development of an improved IBM method is proposed in the present article. This method roots in efficient proposals developed for the simulation of incompressible flows, and it is expanded for compressible configurations. The main feature of this model is the integration of a pressure-based correction of the IBM forcing which is analytically derived from the set of dynamic equations. The resulting IBM method has been integrated in various flow solvers available in the CFD platform OpenFOAM. A rigorous validation has been performed considering different test cases of increasing complexity. The results have been compared with a large number of references available in the literature of experimental and numerical nature. This analysis highlights numerous favorable characteristics of the IBM method, such as precision, flexibility and computational cost efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Immersed boundary (IB) methods deal with incompressible visco-elastic solids interacting with incompressible viscous fluids. A long-standing issue of IB methods is the challenge of accurately imposing the incompressibility constraint at the discrete level. We present the divergence-conforming immersed boundary (DCIB) method to tackle this issue. The DCIB method leads to completely negligible incompressibility errors at the Eulerian level and various orders of magnitude of increased accuracy at the Lagrangian level compared to other IB methods. Furthermore, second-order convergence of the incompressibility error at the Lagrangian level is obtained as the discretization is refined. In the DCIB method, the Eulerian velocity-pressure pair is discretized using divergence-conforming B-splines, leading to inf-sup stable and pointwise divergence-free Eulerian solutions. The Lagrangian displacement is discretized using non-uniform rational B-splines, which enables to robustly handle large mesh distortions. The data transfer needed between the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions is performed at the quadrature level using the same spline basis functions that define the computational meshes. This conduces to a fully variational formulation, sharp treatment of the fluid-solid interface, and a 0.5 increase in the convergence rate of the Eulerian velocity and the Lagrangian displacement measured in L-2 norm in comparison with using discretized Dirac delta functions for the data transfer. By combining the generalized-alpha method and a block-iterative solution strategy, the DCIB method results in a fully-implicit discretization, which enables to take larger time steps. Various two- and three-dimensional problems are solved to show all the aforementioned properties of the DCIB method along with mesh-independence studies, verification of the numerical method by comparison with the literature, and measurement of convergence rates.

AB this article, we propose a conservative phase-field method for tracking the interfaces among three immiscible (ternary) fluids. We formulate a new lattice Boltzmann model to numerically solve the interface-tracking and Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows at high density and viscosity contrasts. Two sets of numerical studies are considered to assess the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model. In the first set, the efficacy of the interface-tracking equation for ternary fluids is probed by considering several benchmark problems, including the diagonal translation of circular interfaces, Zalesak's disk rotation, and two circular interfaces in a shear flow. The numerical findings are compared with those based on the commonly used Cahn-Hilliard model, and noticeable improvement in the accuracy and consistency of the results is achieved. In the second set of the benchmark tests, the hydrodynamic interactions are included to account for the coupling between the LB-based interface-tracking and fluid flow solvers. Several dynamic problems in ternary-fluid systems, such as the classic example of two circular drops, spreading of a liquid lens, spinodal decomposition, and Rayleigh-Taylor instability, are studied and the numerical results are found to be in good agreement with available data. Among advantages of the proposed method is that it conserves mass and does not yield the appearance of an unphysical fluid at the interfaces of other two fluids, an artifact that is common to many existing interface-tracking models for ternary fluids.

AB Overset methods are commonly employed to enable the effective simulation of problems involving complex geometries and moving objects such as rotorcraft. This paper presents a novel overset domain connectivity algorithm based upon the direct cut approach suitable for use with GPU-accelerated solvers on high-order curved grids. In contrast to previous methods it is capable of exploiting the highly data-parallel nature of modern accelerators. Further, the approach is also substantially more efficient at handling the curved grids which arise within the context of high-order methods. An implementation of this new algorithm is presented and combined with a high-order fluid dynamics code. The algorithm is validated against several benchmark problems, including flow over a spinning golf ball at a Reynolds number of 150,000. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel development for a full Eulerian coupling method between a fluid and capsule with hyperelastic membrane to address a cell adhesion process. The capsule motion in the fluid field and their mechanical interactions are expressed in the Eulerian framework, while solving the capsule adhesion process by stochastic events of ligand-receptor bindings in a discrete level, with using Lagrangian markers distributed on the implicit surface of the capsule. In addition to this, numerical improvements of the full Eulerian method for calculating an interface normal vector and dealing with multiple capsules by introducing the temporarily constructed level set function. A numerical validity of the present development is investigated through a comparison with available numerical data in a validation problem, and a capability for the capsule adhesion is shown in a single capsule adhesion and platelet adhesion in a suspension with blood cells.

AB In fluid dynamics, an important problem is linked to the knowledge of the fluid pressure. Recently, another approach to study incompressible fluid flow was suggested. It consists in using a general pressure equation (GPE) derived from compressible Navier-Stokes equation. In this paper, GPE is considered and compared with the Chorin's artificial compressibility method (ACM) and the Entropically damped artificial compressibility (EDAC) method. The three methods are discretized in a staggered grid system with second order centered schemes in space and a third order Runge-Kutta scheme in time. Three test cases are realized: two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex flow, the traveling wave and the doubly periodic shear layers. It is demonstrated that GPE is accurate and efficient to capture the correct behavior for unsteady incompressible flows. The numerical results obtained by GPE are in excellent agreement with those obtained by ACM, EDAC and a classical finite volume method with a Poisson equation. Furthermore, GPE convergence is better than ACM convergence. The proposed general pressure equation (GPE) allows to solve general, time-accurate, incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Finally, the parametric study realized in terms of Mach and Prandtl numbers shows that the velocity divergence can be limited by an arbitrary maximum and that acoustic waves can be damped.

AB We propose a conservative scheme for a high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that arises in the dynamics of infinitely extensible polymer molecules. This leads to a challenging problem of unbounded domain. Our scheme combines the Lagrange-Galerkin method and the Hermite spectral method together with a space splitting approach. We prove that the scheme preserves the discrete mass. Combining it with a stabilized Lagrange-Galerkin method for the Navier-Stokes equations, we further propose a multiscale scheme for the simulation of some viscoelastic polymeric fluids. Several numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the performance of the schemes, and to confirm the conservation of mass at the discrete level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Metal-Intermetallic Laminate (MIL) composites are laminate structures that are fabricated by optimizing unique benefits of constituent components to have attractive physical and mechanical features, such as high strength, stiffness, and toughness. The synthesis of MIL composites involves annealing reaction of multiple metallic elements at high temperatures. In this work, we propose, analyze, and implement a second-order semi-implicit scheme for the annealing of a ternary metallic reaction system. The robustness of such a numerical scheme is demonstrated by various numerical experiments, as well as the expected accuracy tests. At the theoretical level, we provide a detailed convergence analysis, which confirms the second-order accuracy in both the temporal and spatial discretization. Moreover, this numerical scheme is used to study the annealing process of the Al-Fe-Ni ternary system. The computation reproduces the formation of the Al-rich and Ni-rich layers in the annealing process. We present the computational results as diffusion paths in a ternary phase diagram, with a nice agreement with that of experimental data. We also study the growth kinetics of the two layers by calculating the rate constant and kinetic exponent of the reaction. The morphology of interfaces between different layers is thoroughly investigated as well. The computational results indicate that the numerical scheme is an effective, useful tool for predicting the microstructure evolution in the annealing process of a ternary reaction system.
