AB The conductive polymer was introduced to crack surfaces in geopolymers to enable piezo-resistivity. In combination with crack morphology characterization and the piezo-resistive test, the functionalized geopolymer was found to achieve a high sensitivity (with Delta R/R-0/Delta epsilon equals to 376.9 for loading and 513.3 for unloading) to both small external stress (less than 2 MPa) and wide range of strains (up to 1700 mu epsilon). This piezo-resistive behavior can be well described by a coupled mechanical-conductive contact mechanism. A new way to enable the self-sensing function of materials utilizing their existing micro-features was successfully proposed and validated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To improve the mechanical behavior of dissimilar Al/Mg joints, Zn foil, as a brazing filler, was added to the Al/Mg interface when conducting friction stir lap welding with 2A12/AZ31 alloys. Results showed that new phases, such as Mg0.97Zn0.03, Al(0.403)Zn(0.597 )and MgZn2, rather than the continuous brittle Al12Mg17 intermetallic compound (IMC), are formed in the brazing area. At a rotation speed of 375 rpm and a travel speed of 30 mm/min, the tensile shear load of the hybrid joint reached 5.5 kN through a Zn-brazed interface, thereby preventing the formation of the continuous brittle IMC Al12Mg17 and enlarging the overlap bonding area.

AB To improve the corrosion resistance, composite coatings on Mg-1.74Zn-0.55Ca alloy were successfully obtained by the combination of MAO and sol-gel method. The dipping times of the sol-gel process had significant effects on the surface morphologies. The in vitro degradation performance of the composite coatings was investigated via immersion test and electrochemical test. It is shown the composite coatings could act as a barrier to improve the corrosion resistance of MAO coating by reducing the corrosion current. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ZNO
AB Passive thermal control coatings (TCCS) have been widely used to tune the thermal equilibrium of spacecraft. However, the performance of such coatings undergoes serious degradation due to the intensive UV absorption and the radiation damage of the pigments. We developed a Zn2SiO4 pigment with a solar absorptance (alpha(s)) as low as 0.078, which shows a distinctly high reflectance in the whole solarradiation spectrum, especially in the high energy UV wavebands. Furthermore, after performing proton irradiation, the a s of ZnO, ZnTiO3 pigments increase from 0.153 and 0.101 to 0.277 and 0.521, respectively, while Zn2SiO4 rises to 0.212, which exhibits remarkable radiation resistance. We evidenced that Zn2SiO4 pigments will not only significantly boost the performance of thermal control coatings but also be beneficial for UV shielding applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Mechanical stability of these two ceramics is discussed by elastic constant calculation. The G/B ratio and Poisson ratio are calculated to discuss their damage tolerance, fracture toughness and the bond composition. By computing the density of states and the bond stiffness of different bonds in ScAl3C3 and UAl3C3, we discuss their bonding properties. The ratio of the weakest bond stiffness to the strongest bond stiffness is presented to discuss their mechanical properties. What's more, by calculating longitudinal, transverse sound, mean sound velocities, and the Debye temperatures, we discussed the thermal properties of ScAl(3)C(3)and UAl3C3. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A hundreds of microns three-dimensional single crystal diamond (SCD) channel along with high aspect ratio has been fabricated successfully by two-step process. Firstly, laser machining technique was used to produce trenches in high-temperature high-pressure SCD substrate. Then, microchannels were achieved by epitaxial lateral overgrowth of diamond layer on patterned substrate by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition system. Dimensional variations and crystalline quality around the microchannel cross section were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The hollowness and continuity of microchannels were also be tested. It is a significant step towards fabrication of hundreds of microns SCD channel along with controlled high aspect ratio by a simple and controllable way. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we propose a new type of conductive coated glass material and present a new low-cost method for preparing conductive nano-carbon coatings. The coating is prepared with linear low-density polyethylene as carbon source using polymer pyrolysis deposition coating technology. The coating has good electrical conductivity with a thickness of a few nanometers and a surface roughness less than 0.9 nm. It is a good candidate for the fabrication of large-scale, low-roughness and low-cost electrothermal conductive coatings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, TA2/Q235 was used as an composite interlayer to prevent the formation of these brittle Ti-Fe intermetallics when joining TC4 Ti alloy to 304 stainless steel (SS). The TA2/Q235 composite interlayer was prepared by explosive welding. The laser was focused on the TC4-TA2 interface, which joined the TC4 and TA2 by fusion welding. At TC4-TA2 interface, a weld zone was formed due to the mixing of molten TC4 and TA2. The laser was focused on the Q235-304 SS interface, a weld zone was formed due to the mixing of molten Q235 and 304 SS. Composite interlayer TA2/Q235 was used to prevent the formation of Ti-Fe intermetallics during welding and improve microstructure and properties of the Ti alloy-SS joint. The joint fractured at the TA2/Q235 explosive welding interface with the maximum tensile strength of 548 MPa. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS
LA English

DE Electric current pulses; Magnesium alloys; Deformation; Microstructure;
   Twinning; Grain boundaries
AB Electroplasticity has been explained by increased glide due to electron dislocation interactions and thermal effects. However, current pulse treatment of AZ 31 at 0.7 kA mm(-1) within the elastic regime caused significant twinning, occurring in thin bands in the interior of grains. This is inconsistent with a purely dislocation based explanation of electroplasticity, which predicts a suppression of twinning as a strain accommodation mechanism. The presence of unexpected twinning offers insights on the relative contributions of dislocation mediated mechanisms and contributions from Joule heating to the overall effect. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The main aim of this study was to perform a scoping review on the titanium electric stimuli approach to inhibit biofilm accumulation. An electronic search was conducted using key terms related to the incorporation of metal particles on the titanium surface for antibacterial purposes. The search identified 163 studies, of which 37 were considered relevant to this study. Previous studies reported the Ag-based modification of titanium surfaces to inhibit the bacterial adhesion considering that the Ag element has been used as an antimicrobial agent. Other metals such as Au, Zn, Cu, or Mg have been incorporated to titanium implant surfaces for antibiofilm proposal. Those metals are entrapped on the titanium surface and can speed up the exchanging of electrons within an increased electrical current flow. Reactive oxygen species or electron-depleted regions can arise from those interactions and disturb the normal regulation of bacterial functions. The proposed surface modifications showed some degree of antibacterial effect on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria although further studies are required to access a potential cytotoxicity of the metal debris and ions.

AB Weld thinning has been an inherent issue of friction stir welding, which is detrimental to the joint integrity and mechanical properties especially for thin structures. In this paper, a novel method named non-weld-thinning friction stir welding was proposed. The welding tool contained an inner shoulder and an outer shoulder, and it was adjustable to control the protrusion of inner shoulder relative to outer shoulder. The outer shoulder could accumulate and refill the overflowing materials to eliminate weld thinning. The ultimate tensile strength reached 91% of base metal, which indicated that non-weld-thinning friction stir welding had the feasible and potential to realize high quality joint without weld thinning.

AB In this work, nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages were prepared for uric acid detection, which exhibits three dimensional hollow nanostructures with large specific surface area of 565 m(2) g(-1) and unique heteroatomic property. The as-synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages show high selectivity and sensitivity for uric acid detection accompanied with excellent stability. The developed electrochemical analysis for facile determination of uric acid shown a wide linear range of 0-1.0 mM, with the detection limit of 2.07 x 10(-2) mu M (S/N = 3). Moreover, this strategy was successfully used for uric acid detection in human serum and urine samples and demonstrated satisfied recoveries. The result in the present work suggests that nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages hold great potential to use as superior electrochemical sensors for uric acid determination. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Therapeutic efficacy and in vivo biodistribution of a multifunctional nanocomposite comprising of iron/ gold nanohybrid particles coated with oleyl chitosan and conjugated with methotrexate was studied. In vitro studies done using folate receptor negative (3T3 and A549) and folate receptor positive (KB and H460) cell lines revealed the therapeutic effect of nanocomposite on FR (+ve) cell lines. Imaging and biodistribution studies were carried out in vivo using mice model. Magnetic resonance and computed tomography imaging represented the use of nanocomposite as dual modality contrast agents in vivo. Biodistribution studies done in vivo exhibited no significant changes in blood/serum biochemistry and histopathology in nanocomposite injected animals. Hence, it could be conclusively stated that the nanocomposite was biocompatible in vivo and could be used for MR/CT imaging and targeted drug delivery applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalyst has a promising application prospect in solving environment problems and energy crisis. In order to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, a novel TCNAQ/g-C3N4 organic hybrid photocatalyst was designed by introducing 11,11,12,12-tetracyanonaph tho-1,4-quinodimethane (TCNAQ) as an electron acceptor. Due to the interfacial charge-transfer transitions between g-C3N4 donor and TCNAQ acceptor, separation and migration of photo-induced charge carriers were promoted, while their recombination was prohibited, which led to enhanced photocatalytic performance in pollutant degradation. This work provides a strategy to produce efficient hybrid photocatalysts with high light-to-current conversions due to the interfacial charge-transfer transitions, which have potential applications in light-to-energy conversions.

A possible growth mechanism was proposed in this work by analyzing the structural transformation of the AuMSs. The mesospheres with different configurations displayed significant difference in SERS activity, owing to their intricate surface nanostructures. With many desirable properties including high SERS activity, high uniformity, monodispersity and stability, and low background noise, such AuMSs may have potential as ideal SERS substrates.

AB In this work, the zinc-aluminum layered double hydroxide grown on the substrate of graphene and polypyrrole composite (Zn-Al LDHs/GP) was prepared by in-situ growth method, and evaluated as anode materials of Zn-Ni secondary batteries. The results indicate that the Zn-Al LDHs/GP electrode has the smallest peak potential difference (0.452 V), the lowest charge transfer resistance and the superior cycling performance. Compared to the normal Zn-Al LDHs, charge transfer resistance of Zn-Al LDHs/GP electrode is reduced by 6.65 Omega. Moreover, the specific capacity of the Zn-Al LDHs/GP electrode is still remained at 350.0 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles, with a retention rate of 91.5% and it exhibits better rate capability.

AB Herein, the phase separation phenomenon and its effect on the atomic interactions of CoCrNiCux (x = 0, 0.33, 0.66, 1 in molar ratio) medium-entropy alloys were investigated. Phase alteration from single solid-solution face-centered cubic (FCC) phase to Cu-lean FCC1 and Cu-rich FCC2 structures was observed when Cu was added. This occurred due to the positive mixing enthalpy of Cu with other constituents, causing higher Gibbs free energy of mixing with increasing Cu content. This phase separation also affected the atomic interactions in the CoCrNiCux, as demonstrated by an atomic size misfit modelling. The tendency of the atomic interactions was also reflected in the mechanical properties, as displayed by Vickers microhardness result. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Time dependent Cu2SnS3 (CTS) thin films have been synthesized by simplistic arrested precipitation technique (APT) via restricted release of ions from metal complex and used as potential photocathode for photovoltaic application. The influences of deposition time on physico-chemical, optoelectronic performance have been studied for the first time. With progress in reaction time decrement in optical band gap from 1.94 to 1.75 eV was noticed. XRD & Raman analysis verified that CTS crystallize in tetragonal crystal structure. FESEM micrographs depicted nanospherical morphology of the material. The oxidation states of the elements were confirmed from XPS and are in good agreement with CTS. A drastic improvement in the photoconversion efficiency of bare CTS photocathode with 0.34 % was noticed through cell configuration glass/FTO/Cu2SnS3/(I /I-3)/graphite. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We report generation of flow-induced electrical voltage and current associated with changing numbers of graphene layers in graphene surfaces prepared on PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) substrates by moving an ionic droplet of NaCl to investigate the effects of pseudocapacitance phenomena between each graphene surface and the ionic solution. Each sample exhibited different surface energies and electrical ionic double layers on the graphene surface. For each sample, these properties were evaluated by water contact angle measurements and Raman spectra, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrated changes in flow-induced voltage and current generation using various ionic concentrations of NaCl (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 M). Based on triboelectrification and pseudocapacitance phenomena, the generated voltage and power for monolayer graphene were 8.1 and 15.9 times larger, respectively, than the values obtained for 3 layers.

AB In this study, for the first time we report the combined impact of electrospinning, carbon nanofiber (CNF) addition and electrical poling in the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer on its beta phase transition and enhancement of piezoelectric effect. CNF (0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1% (w/w)) dispersed PVDF electrospun nanofibers were characterized for their morphology, functional group and electrical properties using SEM, FTIR, Raman, XRD and impedance analyzer. The developed nanofibers showed promising results in beta phase transition and 0.5% (w/w) CNF filled PVDF nanofibers were found to possess high beta phase crystals compared to other studied samples. After 30 V/mu m electrical polling at 30 degrees C for 6 h, piezoelectric property of 0.5% (w/w) CNF based nanocomposite nanofiber showed highest open circuit voltage and short circuit current (5.8 +/- 0.17 V and 1.2 +/- 0.1 mu A, respectively, at 35 mu m compression). In future, these matrices can be used for development of affordable and nontoxic energy converters in biomedical wearable sensors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithium-sulfur batteries were considered as a new generation of high energy density batteries, but their commercialization was limited by volume expansion, the low conductivity of sulfur and shuttle effect. To overcome these issues, we developed a three-dimensional carbon nanotube/Fe3O4 microspheres via spray drying and calcination as sulfur host materials (S/CNT/Fe3O4). In this three-dimensional microsphere structure, interwoven CNT backbone offers a robust conductive network with sufficient space for loading sulfur, and the polar Fe3O4 nanoparticles can enhance chemical adsorption of polysulfide. Benefiting from these advantages, the S/CNT/Fe3O4 cathode exhibit high initial discharge capacity (1270 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), superior rate performance (602 mAh g(-1) at 3 C), and long cyclic stability (only 0.084% capacity decay per cycle for 300 cycles at 1 C).

AB A new in-situ TiN-AIN/Al composite inoculant with submicron structure was developed by arc melting and melt spinning method using Si3N4 as nitrogen source. Under ultrasonic condition, the as-spun inoculant ribbon shows significant refining effect for pure Al, leading to an obviously reduced grain size from 780 mu m to 140 mu m and increased tensile strength from 57 MPa to 140 MPa. It is found that an obvious crystal orientation difference of 17 degrees 11' is presented between the TiN crystal and the Al matrix, which helps to form a coherent interface. It is proved that TiN can be used as an effective heterogeneous substrate for nucleation of Al crystals. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Physical characterization results show that cubic CdCO3 consists of nanoflake structures, and CdS QDs are uniformly dispersed on the surface of CdCO3 nanoflakes to form heterostructures. Under visible light irradiation, CdCO3/CdS QDs photocatalyst exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance with the photocatalytic H-2 production rate of 1.93 mmol.h(-1)-.g(-1). The cubic CdCO3 can provide a large number of activity sites for CdS QDs, which is conducive to the photocatalytic hydrogen production process. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The problem of poor cyclic stability of FeOOH anodes for supercapacitors was addressed by Zn-doping. Zn-doped FeOOH materials exhibited significant improvement in capacitance retention during cycling. Further improvement in capacitance retention and capacitive properties at low absolute values of negative potentials was achieved in composites containing Zn-doped FeOOH and polypyrrole-coated carbon nanotubes. Another important finding was a simple procedure for the fabrication of MnO2 cathodes, which avoided particle agglomeration during the drying stage and facilitated enhanced mixing of MnO2 and conductive carbon nanotube additives. Enhanced capacitive properties of cathodes and anodes at high active mass loadings allowed good capacitive behavior of the asymmetric devices, which showed promising charge-storage properties for practical applications.

AB Superhydrophobic materials with special functions such as electrical conductivity, magnetism and self-repairing have attracted considerable attention. Herein, a superhydrophobic conductive polydimethylsiloxane@silver nanowires (PDMS@AgNWs) cotton fabric was fabricated via a simple dipping-thermal curing method. Owing to the combination of rough structure constructed by AgNWs and the covered low-surface-energy PDMS, the as-fabricated cotton fabric exhibited superhydrophobicity with a high water contact angle (WCA) of 156 degrees, and the separation efficiency for oil-water mixture reached 95.6%. Importantly, taking advantage of the excellent conductivity and electrothermal conversion performance, the functional cotton fabric was successfully applied in the fields of quick deicing under low temperature and piezoresistive sensing for human motion. Our findings stand out as a new tool to prepare functional superhydrophobic materials with electrical conductivity and electrothermal effect for various potential applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB It is highly desired yet challenging to controllably synthesize heterostructures with well-defined architectures via a facile method at mild conditions. Herein, 3D flower-like Bi2S3/BiOCl heterostructures (BS) were successfully constructed via a one-pot solution-chemistry method at room temperature. It is noteworthy that these 3D flower-like heterostructures exhibit distinctly superior photoactivity for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible light irradiation. Four-fold higher activity of BS than BiOCl is readily ascribed to the formation of heterostructure, which facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the production of active O-2 center dot and h(+) species.

AB In this work, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were incorporated into the flower-like hierarchical chitosan/calcium pyrophosphate hybrid microflowers (CS-CaP) via an in situ reduce process by polydopamine (PDA). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation, Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the formation of Ag NPs on the petals of CS/CaP (Ag@CS/CaP). Since the hierarchical structure of Ag@CS/CaP facilitates the contact of Ag NPs with bacteria, results of the antibacterial test and cell culture showed that the Ag@CS-CaP has efficient antibacterial properties to both E. coli and S. aureus bacteria without causing cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate the Ag@CS-CaP has the potential capacity for biomedical applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We observed that the modified layer was composed of TiN, TiN0.3, TixOy and Ti phases. The second phase strengthening, the fine grain strengthening and the dislocations strengthening are the main reasons for the improvement of wear resistance. Compared with the substrate, all modified layers have lower friction coefficient and better wear resistance. The wear volumes of three kinds of modified layers decrease by about 97%, 72% and 95%, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of activated carbon hollow fibers doped with charcoal powder (WC-ACHFs) were prepared from wood waste by liquefaction, melt spinning and steam activation methods. When evaluated as electrodes, activated carbon hollow fibers doped with charcoal powder exhibited an outstanding gravimetric specific capacitance of 481 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and cyclic stability with 98.8% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles. In addition, the multiple heteroatoms-doping of N and P from wood waste liquefaction have synergistic effect on electrochemical properties of WC-ACHFs, which is due to its combined merits of pseudocapacitance for sufficient charge storage and the good wettability for efficient ion diffusion. These results display that a facile method is promising for the preparation of wood-derived activated carbon hollow fibers from forestry and agricultural residues in the application of electrochemical energy storage.

Cu2O NPs possessed a cubic lattice structure with Pn-3m space group. The average crystallite size of the Cu2O NPs was found to be between 3 and 4 nm. A unique physical shearing method was used to decorate the synthesized Cu2O NPs onto bacterial flagellin protein (BFP). The dendritic-like morphology of Cu2O NPs decorated BFP was confirmed by electronic microscopy. The unique morphological structure of Cu2O NPs decorated onto BFP could deliver an efficient electrochemical conductivity for applications in the field of flexible and bio-nanoelectronic devices.

AB Undoped ZrO2 with tetragonal and/or monoclinic structure was synthesized by the Pechini method. Samples were used for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) in the dark and under ultraviolet irradiation. Despite the absence of dopants, tetragonal phase was predominant after calcination at 600 and 800 degrees C, while the monoclinic phase was obtained after calcination at 1000 degrees C. Different behaviours were observed for samples with different crystalline structures. For the monoclinic zirconia, 74% of the solution was decolourized after 16 h in the dark, and this value increased to 80% when the solution was irradiated with a UV lamp. For the tetragonal zirconia, the influence of irradiation was more important, and the decolourization of the solution increased from 40% in the dark to 100% under UVC irradiation. This result indicated that a meaningful change took place on the surface of the tetragonal zirconia during irradiation, but no meaningful photocatalytic activity was observed, and adsorption was responsible for the solution decolourization. In addition to environmental remediation, the adsorption of MB onto the t-ZrO2 led to the formation of a new product, a ZrO2/MB composite that may be used as a pigment, with very low MB solubility in water and blue colour, stable under UVA irradiation.

ID MICROSTRUCTURE
AB Spherical WTaMoNbV refractory high entropy alloy powders were fabricated by milling and spheroidizing using inductively-coupled thermal plasma. The WTaMoNbV alloy is brittle at room temperature; therefore, the alloy ingot could be pulverized by jaw-crushing and ball-milling, and the fabricated powders had an irregular shape. After sieving using meshes ranging in size from 25 to 63 mu m, the powders were spheroidized using inductively-coupled thermal plasma. Using this process, spherical WTaMoNbV high entropy alloy powders with d(50) of 45.1 mu m could be fabricated successfully. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new method for fabricating highly patterned small blocks of nanogold-loaded PDMS, named as PDMS/Au, and their surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity are reported. This nanocomposite is based on nanogold impregnated into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer, prepared previously as patterned small blocks using a polypropylene template (PPT), containing 120 small holes. All holes of PPT have the same dimensions 0.5 cm (depth) x 0.6 cm (diameter), allowing to prepare 120 patterned PDMS blocks per batch. After the reduction reaction of HAuCl4 in ethanol medium, the colorless PDMS blocks turned wine red, which was a visual indication of nanogold formation. Using para-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA) as probing molecule, SERS spectra were investigated. The PDMS/Au substrate exhibited reproducibility of the p-MBA (10(6) mol L-1) Raman signal. The convenience for preparing, stability, and using makes it a promise candidate for SERS application in the fast lab and field analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In our work, a Ni6MnO8/NiMnO3 composite, which are porous cuboids coated with porous spheres to form a 3D hierarchical structure, is successfully fabricated using a one-step solvothermal method. As an electrode material, this composite possesses high specific capacitance (291.9F/g at 1 A/g) and excellent rate capability (77.2% of specific capacitance maintained at 10 A/g). The specific capacitance retention is 83.4% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 3 A/g. The enhanced performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Ni6MnO8 and NiMnO3, which can provide more active sites for redox reaction and contribute to electrolyte ion transport. Results demostrate that the Ni6MnO8/NiMnO3 composite as an electrode material in supercapacitors exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance and potential for various applications.

ID ALGINATE
AB Agar-based composites with different Zn-carbonate mineral phase content were prepared by in situ mineralization and the solvent casting method. The mineral phase within the composite films was identified as hydrozincite, Zn-5(CO3)(2)(OH)(6). The presence of the mineral phase improved, both mechanical and water vapor permeability properties of the obtained composite films, in a concentration-dependent manner. The release of zinc ions from composite films is in accepted levels (up to 2.5%), and sufficient to provide complete inhibition growth of S. Aureus. The results of this study suggest that agar/Zn-carbonate composites could be potentially used as affordable, eco-friendly and functional materials with tunable properties for food packaging, agriculture or biomedical application. In situ procedure offers possibilities for tailoring the physical-chemical properties of composite films, by varying the Zn-mineral phase load. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study shows the energy harvesting ability from a transparent Cu2O/ZnO/AZO heterojunctions device. Particularly, the electron selective AZO/ZnO and hole selective Cu2O enables the formation of photovoltaic behaviour with a V-oc of 0.52 V. It is demonstrated that even with high transparency of the photoactive oxide layers of similar to 80%, the device shows the maximum conversion efficiency of similar to 0.70% depending on the incoming photon intensity. In addition, wavelength-selective performance of the device demonstrates a maximum responsivity of 2.13 A/W towards 400 nm. This transparent device architecture study will serve the foundation to be useful to design advanced see-through devices beyond the energy generation entities to be applied in power generating windows and skyscrapers.

AB AlSi10Mg is an interesting structural material due to its high specific mechanical properties, and good weldability which makes it a good candidate for additive manufacturing by selective laser melting. In this paper, the evolution of pores is visualized and quantified in an AlSi10Mg fabricated by selective laser melting using in-situ tension coupled with X-ray computed tomography. Graphical models were produced in order to visualize the evolution of pores, and the volume fraction, density, and mean diameter of pores were determined at each stage of deformation. Significant coalescence of pores was found during post-uniform elongation. Dimples on the fracture surfaces indicate ductile fracture. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin (PVA/SF) nanofibrous heart patch with unique tensile properties was fabricated by an electrospinning technique based on a water-solvent system. The fabricated heart patches were exposed to 2% Glutaraldehyde vapor to provide a cross-linkage and tune the degradation behavior. Numerous characterizations of the modified PVA/SF patches such as surface morphology, chemical bonding, mechanical behavior, biodegradation, and biological assessment of the crosslinked PVA/SF patches were performed. It was found that pronounced and interconnected PVA/SF composite fibrous patches had an average nanofiber diameter of 228 +/- 49 nm. In addition, incorporation of SF into PVA nanofibers enhanced the mechanical properties (i.e. tensile strength and tensile modulus) and tuning the degradation rate of the PVA/SF patch. Human cardiac fibroblast cells (HCFC) were cultured on the cross-linked composite patches and the results showed good cell proliferation and attachment on the patches bio-interface.

AB Herein, nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide/zinc ferrite (NRGO/ZnFe2O4) hybrid nanocomposites were synthesized through a facile one-pot hydrothermal strategy by using graphene oxide (GO) as a substrate. Results demonstrated that the additive amounts of GO had remarkable influence on the micromorphology and microwave absorption properties of NRGO/ZnFe2O4 hybrid nanocomposites. The as-prepared hybrid nanocomposites showed good dispersion of nanoparticles as the additive amounts of GO increasing and numerous ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles uniformly loaded on the crumpled surface of thinly flake-like NRGO were observed. It was found that the obtained hybrid nanocomposites exhibited obviously enhanced microwave absorption performance than that of pure ZnFe2O4. Remarkably, the minimum reflection loss reached -54.6 dB at 10.0 GHz (X-band) and effective absorption bandwidth achieved 4.2 GHz (11.8-16.0 GHz) with a thickness of merely 2.0 mm and filler loading of 40 wt%. It was believed that our results could be helpful for designing and fabricating graphene-based composites as high-efficient microwave absorbers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the pharmaceutical sciences, there are many applications for Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH). In industry, these materials undergo drying processes which can promote changes on their physicochemical properties. Using MgAl-LDH as a model, the objective of this work was to investigate the influence of two technological drying procedures (spray-drying and lyophilization) on LDH properties, applying the following techniques: FTIR, XRD, thermogravimetric analysis, particle size, SEM, specific surface area and pore size The results showed that LDH obtained by spray-drying generated small particles with a narrow particle size distribution and a more stable spherical morphology, whereas LDH obtained by lyophilization showed lower water content, irregular particles, slightly larger surface area and bigger pore size. These different aspects should finally be taken into consideration in the development of pharmaceutical formulations with desirable characteristics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel magnetic composite material constituted by Co3C (as hard magnetic phase) and Co0.35Fe (0.65) (as soft magnetic phase) was synthesized. Ball milling, which is not only easy to use but also industrially viable for large scale production of materials, was used to synthesize both the constituents of the composite and the Co3C-Co0.35Fe0.65 composite itself. Co based phases are chosen because they can be synthesized as both hard and soft magnetic phases by changing appropriate alloying elements. Moreover, the choice of Co3C was made because it is a metastable phase, which can be easily prepared by ball milling. Exchange spring mechanism between the hard and soft magnetic phases in the composite allowed the synergy between (the high coercivity exhibiting) Co3C and (the high saturation magnetization exhibiting) Co0.35Fe0.65 phases, which in turn allowed the realization of an energy product (BHmax) greater than that of the constituents.

AB Cu, Cu-Zr and Cu(N)/Cu-Zr films were deposited on Si (100) substrate by magnetron sputtering. The effect of Zr and the CuN covering film on the diffusion behaviors between Cu-Zr alloy film and Si substrate were investigated. Results show that the addition of Zr and the Cu(N) covering film have significant influences on the shape and quantity of Cu3Si compounds. In contrast to the long strip shape of Cu3Si in the annealed Cu/Si and Cu-Zr/Si systems, a large number of octahedral Cu3Si compounds formed in the Cu (N)/Cu-Zr/Si after annealing at 500 degrees C. It is worth noting that inverted pyramid structures on Si surface with large specific surface area can be obtained by removing Cu3Si and films. This work provides a new method for the surface modification of single-crystal Si. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ENHANCED RAMAN-SCATTERING; GOLD NANOPARTICLES
AB A simple soluble starch-hydroquinone system was explored, in which flower-like and star-like gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) could be individually synthesized only by adjusting the injection rate of the precursor solution. Meanwhile, their size could be easily tuned just by changing the molar ratio of Au3+ ions and Au seeds in the precursor solution. As-prepared samples were proved to be polycrystalline, pure and stable Au NPs by means of various characterization techniques. Clearly, the novel and facile method to control the shape (morphology and size) can provide a unique perspective for the shape control of other metal NPs. In addition, obtained Au NPs showed distinct shape-determined surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity towards Rhodamine 6G molecules, implying their potential for applications in SERS-based detections and analysis.

AB Micro-sized Co(OH)F hexagram-loops were first synthesized through a facile solvothermal method, with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) as a shape-control reagent. The facets ( -3 1 0) and (3 1 0) of Co(OH)F were well preserved by the abduction of PVP. As anodes for lithium ion batteries, the obtained Co(OH)F without any carbon coating delivered a high specific capacity of 642 mAh g(1) at 200 mA g(1) after 200 cycles. Even at a higher rate of 500 mA g(1), a respectable capacity of 470 mAh g(1) was still maintained over 360 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to stepwise lithiation feature and the unique microstructure of Co(OH)F hexagram-loops. The pyramid-like peaks could shorten Li+ ion diffusion distance from all directions, and the large void at the center of loops increases the electrode/electrolyte contact area and buffers volumetric changes upon charge/discharge.

DE Polymers; Elastic modulus; Nanoimprint; Indentation; Microstructure
AB Nanoimprint, an important nanofabrication technology, is widely adopted to produce the microstructure. In this study, nanoindentation was employed to quantitatively characterize the elastic modulus of nanoimprinted poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) under different conditions, with the purpose to investigate the mechanical property of the nanoimprinted microstructure suffered the ultra-high local stress and temperature. It is indicated that the elastic modulus of samples increases with the increasing the residual stress and the nanoimprint temperature. Moreover, the optical birefringence method was performed to investigate the distribution of residual stress on the microstructure. It was shown that high elastic modulus region also exhibited high residual stress. Therefore, we suggested that the temperature during the embossing process should be rigorously considered in nanoimprint process to obtain a mechanical homogeneity of imprinted structures.

AB Collecting water from dew, foggy wind or moisture present in the air recently has been recognized as a method to solve water shortage. In this paper, the directional fog harvesting ability of the pine needles is investigated. Results show that water droplets deposited on the surface of the pine needles can spontaneously move toward the root along the microchannel formed by the groove structure under the Laplace pressure generated by the shape gradient. This process is underpinned by the wettability gradient present on the surface. Inspired by the directional water-catching ability of pine needles, a pineneedle-like structure was constructed to achieve efficient fog harvesting without applying any external force.

AB Currently, the Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSB) suffer from the issue of severe "polysulfide shuttle", else they have a great potential to support next-generation energy storage. Herein, hollow porous doubleshelled Co3O4 x microspheres with abundant oxygen deficiency were prepared for lithium polysulfides (LPS) fixation. The rational hollow porous structure facilitated sulfur loading and multiple spatial confinement on LPS was implemented by the double shells. An abundant oxygen deficiency not only promoted electronic transfer but also relieved polarization during the cycling process. Hence, the S-Co3O4 (x) cathode delivered satisfying cycling performance and rate capability.

AB Herein, we successfully prepared the Nickel oxide (NiO) nanomaterials with the structure of two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb-like nanoplates assembled by nanosheet arrays through the hydrothermal synthesis. In addition, the growth mechanism of this unusual nanostructure was proposed. Surprisingly, such NiO nanoplates exhibits superior gas-sensing properties to CO, which is mainly attributed to the hollow structure produced by the arrangement of nanosheets, contributing not only enough gases diffusion pathways but sufficient reaction sites during the gas sensing processes.

AB In this work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) decorated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles and then covered with MnO2 membrane were synthesized by hydrothermal method as supercapacitor negative material. Thanks to this special structure, the Fe3O4 /CNTs@MnO2 negative material showed a high specific capacitance of 643.8 F g (-1) at 1 A g (-1). Moreover, the full-pseudocapacitance symmetrical supercapacitor device was assembled, exhibiting excellent specific capacitance (132 F g (-1) at 1 A g (-1)) and wonderful stability (63% at 1 Ag (-1) after 10,000 cycling). It is worth mentioned that the stability wasn't decayed from 1000 to 10,000 cycling. Specially, after lighting one white LED bulb (working voltage greater than 3 V), two fully charged symmetric supercapacitors (in series) can continue to light four red LED bulbs.

ID TENSILE; LAYERS; MODEL
AB The influence of plasma nitriding on the mechanical properties and microstructural deformation response of an Al0.3CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) were investigated. The results reveal that the presence of high density nano-nitrides on the surface tremendously enhances the hardness approaching to 14 GPa. Comparing with the HEA matrix, the deformation mechanism of nitride layer changes from interaction between dislocations and solute atoms to phase-boundary sliding under localized stress due to the absence of dislocation nucleation and propagation. The different underlying deformation mechanisms in two alloys result in distinct serration behaviors and change of activation volume. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, due to the large cavity structure of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Au@ZIF-67 was synthesized by loading nanoscale Au nanoparticles (NPs) into Co based zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-67). Subsequently, Au@ZIF-67 was calcined to produce Au NPs loading Co(3)O(4 )hollow nanocages (Au@Co3O4). The small size Au NPs were distributed on the wall of Co3O4 hollow nanocages. The final product in a polyhedral morphology formed hollow nanocages. The unique structure could provide a high specific surface area. As an electrode material of supercapacitors, the Au@Co3O4 electrode with polyhedral morphology showed a specific capacity of 763 F.g(-1) at a current density of 1 Ag-1 in 2.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the specific capacitance retention rate was 83.7% at a current density of 10 A g(-1) after 5000 cycles. These results indicate that Au@Co3O4 electrodes with polyhedral morphology have very wide application prospects in supercapacitors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Homogeneous porous carbons were obtained from phenolic resin/ethylene glycol resin mixtures based on polymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS) by the addition of boric acid and divalent metal iron salt. The mechanism of boric acid and divalent metal iron salt promoting pore formation was studied. The research indicates: the resulting porous carbon sample has a bigger pore size and a more uniformly distributed pore structure under the synergistic action of boric acid and a divalent metal iron salt, and its carbon matrix morphology is in the form of spherical particles. Under the synergistic effect, the average pore size of the porous carbon sample is increased to 1226 +/- 48 nm. The reaction of the boric acid with the resin mixture promotes an increase in the molecular chain of the monomer, which is polymerized around the divalent metal iron salt to form a spherical polymer.

The pi-pi interaction ensures an effective adsorption of ErB dye upon UiO-66 and the functionalized organic linkers guarantee the growth of NiS2. The UiO-66/NiS2 composite with optimal content of NiS2 (5.0 wt%) offers an active H-2 generation rate of 18.4 mu mol h(-1), nearly 2 times higher than that by using NiS2 and ErB (9.8 mu mol h(-1)).

AB A conceptually new method based on plasma-electrochemical technique is demonstrated for the onestep synthesis of carbon supported Pt nanoparticles. Ethanol and chloroplatinic acid aqueous solution were used as the carbon and platinum sources, respectively, without involving any extra chemicals. Results showed that crystalline Pt nanoparticles as well as amorphous nanocarbons could be simultaneously generated to form Pt/C nanocomposites under the plasma impact, where the Pt content can be tuned by regulating the chloroplatinic acid concentration. Moreover, the formation mechanisms of the C and Pt/C nanocomposites in the studied system were discussed. The demonstrated simple, unique, one-pot and environmentally-benign process should bring interest in this emerging nanofabrication technique. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

HIP resulted in a transformation of acicular a' martensite in the AF sample into a mixture of a and I lathes and a simultaneous reduction of internal porosity from 5.9% in the AF state to 0.5% after HIP treatment. As a consequence, the HIP samples exhibited significantly improved compressive strength and fracture strain as compared to the AF sample. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Direct ink writing (DIW) of 3D printed ceramics is an eco-friendly, efficient, and innovative shaping technique that offers unlimited freedom and flexibility in fabrication. Currently, 3D printing processing technology for ceramic shaping generally employs laser beam, ultraviolet (UV) or visible curable resins to maintain shape. Here, a novel 3D printing of alumina ceramic parts through heat-induced DIW is developed. During the heat-induced solidification process, only 0.4 wt% carrageenan is required to maintain the shape. The experimental results show that the paste displays a pseudoplastic fluid characteristic, which is suitable for 3D printing. The optimized heat-induced paste shows that when the temperature is over 65 degrees C, the paste viscosity increases sharply, resulting in a more uniform green body. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Multifunctional ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) combining ultrasonic diagnosis with tumor therapy have received enormous attentions in virtue of their good biocompatibility and high biological penetration ability. However, nanoscale UCAs with suitable size and good therapeutic effect remain to be developed in future studies. Herein, indocyanine green and L-menthol loaded hybrid cerasomes (ICG-MCNs) was fabricated as a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform, which exhibited high structure stability and photo-stability in aqueous. Mutual assistance with the photothermal effect of ICG, heating triggered tri-phase transition of L-menthol could produce continuous gas microbubbles for enhanced ultrasound imaging. Thus, the resultant ICG-MCNs is anticipated to be a competent candidate for US imaging and photothermal therapy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic dyes have received extensive attention due to their broad applications related to nonlinear optics, biological and chemical sensors. Herein, a novel chromophore based on double donors and tricyanofuran acceptor was prepared and studied. This new chromophore displayed excellent thermal stability showing the onset decomposition temperature higher than 230 degrees C. Moreover, density functional theory calculation shows that chromophore y1 presented a lower HOMO-LUMO energy gap and a much larger hyperpolarizability (beta) than the single donor chromophore. These results showed that the double donors can increase the donor ability and thus enhance nonlinear optical properties. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate heterogeneous integration of 2D self-assembled films of Au nanoparticles (NPs) and 2D MoS2 monolayer. The Au NPs film has a compact, long-range-ordered structure, with its particles exhibiting a narrow size distribution. In addition, large-area coverage was achieved between the two components. Photoluminescence (PL) quenching was observed after the attachment of Au NPs film onto MoS2 monolayer, which was attributed to electron transfer and shielding of light by Au NPs film.

AB Al-6Zn-3Mg-2Cu-0.5Sc alloy with 85% rolling reduction from the original thickness at room and cryogenic temperatures leads to high tensile strength and higher dislocation density for the cryorolled (CR) (-80 degrees C) sample. Microstructural investigation and their properties on mechanical behaviour of Al-6Zn-3Mg-2Cu-0.5Sc alloy were noted in detail during rolling as-cast, room temperature rolling (RTR) and cryorolling (-80 degrees C) conditions. The CR (-80 degrees C) sample revealed greater work hardening value than the as-cast alloy, due to the effect of CR and the presence of Al3CuMg precipitates. The Hierarchical Grain Size Distribution (HGSD) reported in cryorolled samples via Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) studies, and it leads to a high strength of 537 MPa and 17% ductility in CR (-80 degrees C) samples. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies revealed that the high dense dislocations and nano sized intermetallic compounds are equally distributed alongside the matrix in the CR (-80 degrees C) among the rolled samples. Al-6Zn-3Mg-2Cu-0.55c alloy showed improved mechanical properties during various rolling conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel low-firing microwave dielectric ceramics LiMg(1-x)A(x)PO(4)(A = Mn, Ca, 0.02 <= x <= 0.08) with orthorhombic olivine structure were synthesized using the solid-state reaction method. The effects of Mn2+ and Ca2+ on the phase composition, sintering behaviors and microwave dielectric properties of LiMgPO4 ceramics were studied in detail. To some extent, Mn2+ and Ca2+ reduced the sintering temperature of LiMgPO4 ceramics and improved its properties. Both systems exhibited excellent comprehensive properties (LiMg0.96Mn0.04PO4: epsilon(r) = 6.54, Q*f = 84,343 GHz, tau(f) = -44.9 ppm/degrees C, T-s (optimum sintering temperature) = 875 degrees C; LiMg0.94Ca0.06PO4: epsilon(r) = 6.96, Q*f = 88,968 GHz, tau(f) = -44.7 ppm/degrees C, T-s = 800 SC).

The dielectric loss of the beaded chains ZrC/C/SiC nanocomposites were investigated in a frequency of 2.0-18.0 GHz, which was increased by about 10 times than the nanowires, reaching 0.41, and the maximum value is 0.66. It was observed that the heterogeneous interface between C, ZrC and SiC, carbon defects and beaded chains nanostructures could effectively enhance the microwave absorption properties of the nanocomposites.

AB We developed a strategy to inhibit lithium sulfide shuttle effect and to improve electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries. Our approach included incorporation of N-doped carbon nanofibers containing uniformly distributed Co nanoparticles in to a carbon cloth (CC). The resulting novel 3D structured material does not only possess excellent short-and long-range electrical conduction, but, when used as a current collector in Li-S batteries, can also mitigate volume expansion associated with the charge-discharge processes. In addition, structural and morphological change associated with Co nanoparticles presence and N-doping provide efficient adsorption as well as accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfide. Additionally, current collector based on this carbon-cloth composite demonstrated excellent cycle and rate performance. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The effect of temperature and strain rate on the flow stress of this alloy was evaluated, and, the constitutive equation was obtained, which could well predict the flow stress. Furthermore, the microstructure evolution was investigated, it was also found that the elongated primary alpha and secondary alpha grains became equiaxed through suitable treatment, where the deformation mechanism was dynamic recrystallization.

AB The graphene (Gr) reacted with Al, and the Al4C3 phase was precipitated during selective laser melting (SLM). The interfacial structure of Al/Al4C3 was calculated by the first principle. The degree mismatch between Al (1 1 1) and Al4C3 (0 0 0 1) interface was lowest. Al (1 1 1)/Al4C3 (0 0 0 1) interface models with different stacking sequences (top-site, center-site, and hollow-site) of different terminations (Altermination and C-termination) were established. C-termination-center-sited interface has largest work of adhesion, and interfacial energy of this model is lower than that of alpha-Al/Al melt (0.151/m(2)), so that alpha-Al nucleus tend to form on the C-termination-center-sited Al4C3 (0 0 0 1). Al-C covalent bonds and Al-Al metallic bonds are formed across interface, which increased interfacial bonding strength. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that the melt-spun Mg86Pr3Al11 alloy exhibits an enhanced cycle durability of hydrogen absorption and desorption. After fifty hydrogen absorption and desorption cycles at 300 degrees C, the capacity retention rate is about 97% and the hydrogen sorption kinetics undertakes only a slight degradation, which is related to the existence of PrAl2 and Pr3Al11 phases in the melt-spun Mg86Pr3Al11 alloy.

AB The Ba4Ti13O30 and BaTi5O11 nanocrystals were synthesized by a hydrothermal method, and the effect of NaOH concentration on formation of Ba4Ti13O30 and BaTi5O11 nanocrystals was investigated. In the Ba-Ti precursors, the concentrations of Ba2+ and Ti4+ ions were kept at 0.018 and 0.082 mol/L, and the NaOH concentration changed from 1 to 8 mol/L. As the Ba-Ti precursors were heated in the autoclave at 280 degrees C for 20 h with vigorous stirring, the pure BaTi5O11 nanocrystals with rice-like morphology were obtained at NaOH concentration of 1 mol/L, and the Ba4Ti13O30 nanowires were co-formed with the rice-like BaTi5O11 nanocrystals at NaOH concentration of 2 mol/L. With increasing the NaOH concentration, the amount of Ba4Ti13O30 nanowires increased. The phase evolution from monoclinic BaTi5O11 to orthorhombic Ba4Ti13O30 could be controlled by adjusting NaOH concentration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithium disilicate melt in DSC containers made of platinum rhodium alloy PtRh20 is repetitively supercooled at two different oxygen partial pressures. Using 5 different cooling rates and 332 runs per cooling rate, kinetic data of heterogeneous crystal nucleation are determined with high statistical significance. Two different types of crystallizations are evident. A first at higher supercooling temperature exclusively consists of lithium disilicate crystals and a second at lower supercooling temperature consists of a mix of lithium metasilicate and quartz crystals. Increasing oxygen partial pressure shifts the probabilities of both nucleation types to higher temperatures and shorter times. It is assumed that under oxidizing conditions an increasing oxygen saturation coverage at the surface of the platinum alloy promotes crystal nucleation close to the three-phase boundary between oxidized metal, supercooled melt and furnace atmosphere.

AB Machine learning (ML) methods are becoming popular tools for predicting and designing novel materials. In particular, neural network (NN) is a promising ML method, which can be used to identify hidden trends in the data. However, these methods rely on a large dataset and often exhibit overfitting when used with a sparse dataset. Further, assessing the uncertainty in predictions for a new dataset or an extrapolation of the present dataset is challenging. Herein, using Gaussian process regression (GPR), we predict Young's modulus for silicate glasses having a sparse dataset. We show that GPR significantly outperforms NN for the sparse dataset while ensuring no overfitting. Further, thanks to the nonparametric nature, GPR provides quantitative bounds for the reliability of predictions while extrapolating. Overall, GPR presents an advanced ML methodology for accelerating the development of novel functional materials such as glasses.

AB The effects of La2O3 on microstructure and properties of the CaO-MgO-SiO2-Al2O3 glass ceramics, made from Bayan Obo West Mine tailing and fly ash, were investigated. Results showed that 12203 additions up to 2 wt% promoted augite crystallization. Above this concentration, La2O3 suppressed augite crystallization by rather forming lanthanum oxyapatite that acted as a barrier for the growth of augite. Also Cr ions, the key element for the augite nuclei, were enriched in lanthanum oxyapatite. The La3+ cations were found to partially substitute for Ca2+ at the M2 structural sites in clinopyroxene (augite). Nano crystalline clusters, containing La3+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Fe3+ in augite-like proportions, were found uniformly dispersed in the residual glassy phase. The glass ceramic with 2 wt% La2O3 shows optimum mechanical properties and chemical durability. The bending strength and Vickers hardness are 238 MPa and 7.57 GPa, acid and alkali-resistance are 97.5% and 98.9%, respectively.

AB Lithium tellurite glasses with xTeO(2) + (100 - x)Li2O nominal composition, where x = 95, 90, 85, 80, 75 and 70 mol%, have been prepared to investigate the dependence of the Te4+ emission as a function of the lithium modifier. Optical and structural properties of the glasses were explored by using UV-Vis absorption, photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopies, photoluminescence lifetime and Raman spectroscopy. Besides, the influence of Li2O in the glass structure was verified by density, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, glass-forming tendency, optical band edge and the number of non-bridging oxygen. The results support there is a good correlation between the glass structure and the Te4+ center concentration: the Li2O content contributes to increase the Te4+ in the glass structure.

AB The rapid consumption of natural sources due to the technological development brings environmental and economic problems and makes usage of alternative sources obligatory. Fly ash is one of an industrial waste that can be used as alumina silicate source for geopolymerization. In this study, fly ash based geopolymer was synthesized by Alkali Fusion Method. The experimental set up was designed by Design Expert Trial 7 program and the optimum geopolymer synthesis conditions including additional Al2O3 ratio, curing temperature were determined by Central Composite Inscribed Design (CCI) Method. Also, ANOVA analysis and optimization were carried out. X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning electron microscope-Energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzes were applied for the characterization studies of the raw materials and optimum geopolymer sample. According to optimization and analysis results, the optimum Al2O3 addition (%) and curing temperatures were determined as 70.76% and 36.75 degrees C, respectively. The degree of geopolymerization reaction for optimum geopolymer sample was found as 97%.

AB The short-range order and electrical properties of amorphous boron arsenide (BAs) are evaluated by means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The amorphous model is obtained from the fast solidification of the BAs melt and consists of B-rich and As-rich domains. The average coordination number of B- and As-atoms are found as 4.97 and 3.34, respectively. B-atoms have a tendency to form pentagonal pyramidal-like configurations as commonly seen in boron or boron rich materials. Yet B-12 molecules do not develop in the system but the formation of a B-10 cluster is perceived in the network. On the other hand, As-atoms have a trend to structure chain-like motifs and four-membered rings. Amorphization yield about 31% volume expansion in the amorphous network. All these findings reveal that the model shows strong chemical disorder and its short-range order is considerably different than that of the crystal. Amorphization-induced metallization is proposed for BAs.

AB Physical, mechanical and radiation shielding properties of ZnO-MoO3-TeO2 glasses were studied. Density, molar volume, oxygen molar volume, oxygen packing density were evaluated for the interpretation of physical properties. Mechanical properties were determined through Vickers hardness measurements. The shielding estimation was accomplished by studying linear attenuation coefficient (LAC mu), mass attenuation coefficient (MAC), effective atomic number (Z(eff)), effective electron density (N-eff), mean free path (mfp), exposure buildup factor (EBF) and energy absorption buildup factor (EABF). The glasses were irradiated by Ba-133 radioactive source emitting gamma rays in the range of 79.61 keV to 383.80 key to determine LACs and MACs. mfp values were calculated for present glasses and compared with various concretes and a commercial window glass in energy region 81-384 key. The glass structure became stronger and mechanical properties showed an increment with increasing MoO3 content. Synthesized glasses have lower mfp values indicating better shielding properties than concretes and window glass.

AB In-situ preparation of nanocomposite including a shape memory alloy (Ni-Ti) as reinforcement in the Ni amorphous matrix is the subject of this content. Firstly, the amorphous alloy has been prepared using high-energy ball milling of pure elements, i.e., Ni, Nb, Ti and Si as alloying elements. Then, by the employment of kinetic modeling, the crystallization process (i.e., as a two-step phenomenon) of prepared amorphous alloy has been controlled in a way that provides the possibility of the formation of Ni-Ti as the reinforcement within the Ni amorphous alloy matrix. Also, the kinetic modeling revealed that the crystallization can be explained using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) model. Also, the crystallization phenomenon started by interface controlled with one-dimensional growth of nuclei at first and followed by interface controlled with two and three-dimensional growth of nuclei.

AB sp(2) Amorphous carbons are considered as objects of the modern nanotechnology. A particular set of the highest-carbon-content sp(2) species, two natural amorphous carbons (shungite carbon and antraxolite) as well as two engineered carbon blacks were subjected to analytical study by using a set of selected modern structural and compositional analytical techniques. The suggested approach occurred quite efficient and allowed disclosing a number of steady points that are common to the whole class of this carbon allotrope and are able to get a vision of atom-molecular representation of the solids. Among the commonalities observed, there are the following: i) sp(2) Amorphous carbons are conglomerates of nanographites, basic structure units of which lay the foundation of the atom-molecular description of the solids. ii) The units represent framed graphene molecules of 1 divided by 2 nm and of 1 divided by (1 divided by 3)*10 nm in size in the case of natural and engineered products, respectively. iii) The molecule framing, predominantly incomplete with respect to the number of vacant places, concerns only edge atoms and is implemented by the related chemical additives, such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and halogens which are attached to the carbon core via chemical bonding. iv) Inelastic neutron scattering and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy allow attributing the bonds to chemical compositions involving hydrogen and oxygen while quantum chemistry ensures reliable support. v) The basic structure units of sp(2) amorphous carbons are strongly radicalized due to which the latter acquire new properties, being the largest repository of stable radicals.

AB Magnox and international radioactive waste glasses observe significantly different aqueous dissolution behaviours. Previously, the effects of Li on the kinetics of dissolution and B network of analogues of a complex Magnox waste glass were investigated (Li-Mg-EM). Here, an "International Simple Glass" with Li substituted for Na at two ratios (Li-ISG) was fabricated to compare the aqueous durability of Magnox and international glasses. B-11 MAS-NMR, Na-23 MAS-NMR, Li-6-H-1 CP-NMR and SEM studies are presented. The B-III/B-IV ratio and the role of Na in the pristine glasses varied insignificantly with the Li:Na ratio. Further, the B network of Li-ISG was shown to leach congruently. Li, Na and Mg-containing secondary phases were present for Li-Mg-EM, whilst no precipitates were observed for Li-ISG. Li in ISG was shown to be etrimental but further substitution of Li improved long-term aqueous durability, which was attributed to a Li-Na mixed alkali effect for Li-ISG but not Li-Mg-EM.

AB Precipitated silica (PS) could be an interesting alternative to fumed silica (FS) for the core of Vacuum Insulation Panels (VIP), in particular to reduce their cost and widen their use. However, compacted PS exhibits, for the same density, lower mechanical properties than FS. A better understanding of the mechanical behavior of these materials would help to design PS with optimized mechanical properties for VIP. In this work, complemented with experimental characterization, Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations are used to investigate the compaction behavior and post-compaction tensile behavior of a set of numerically generated silica aggregates with varying neck size, surface energy and morphology (primary particle size, fractal dimension and gyration radius). During the compaction stage, neck size has the largest influence on the mechanical behavior, whereas during the tensile stage the influence of surface energy predominates. These results should be taken with caution as the task of modeling such a complex system necessarily involves bias due to simplifying assumptions. However, it is believed that the experimentally observed differences between PS and FS in compaction behavior and strength may lie not only in aggregates morphological differences, but also in different surface energies and neck sizes.

AB Glass samples in the form 80TeO(2)-(20-x)Na2O-xTiO(2) with x = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol%, were fabricated by the melting quenching technique. The thermal behavior of samples was analyzed considering their crystallization kinetics mechanism and microstructural analysis. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was performed at 20 ml/min argon flux and heating rates of 10, 13, 15 and 20 K/min, from ambient temperature to 873 K, and these data were analyzed using a non-isothermal model of phase transformation. The activation energy for crystallization and Avrami exponent were determined for each sample. We observed that the crystallization process depends on the role assumed by the TiO2, a modifier (5 mol%) or former network (10 and 15 mol%). The crystallization process changes from superficial to internal or three-dimensional crystallizations with increasing TiO2 content.

DT Article
ID SPECTROSCOPY; WATER
AB A new model of non-Debye dielectric relaxation, which leads to the popular in broadband dielectric spectroscopy Havriliak-Negami expression for two-power-law dielectric response, is proposed. The new model is based on the multiple trapping model and the fractal diffusion model. Explicit analytical expressions for experimentally measured values such as dielectric strength, characteristic relaxation time, and power-law exponents, which include the microscopic parameters of the medium, are obtain. The comparison of the expression for the relaxation time with the experiment is demonstrated. A clear physical interpretation of the power-law exponents of the Havriliak-Negami relaxation function is found, one makes it possible to extend the area application of this function and to use it for the fitting of dielectric data, which exhibit atypical relaxation behavior.

AB In this work, novel ternary Co100-x-yMoxBy (at.%, x = 18-28, y = 11-17) bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with ultrahigh strength and good ductility were developed by copper mold casting technology. The best glass former of the marginal BMG chemical composition was Co64Mo22B14 with a maximum critical size up to 2 mm in diameter. It revealed that the compressive strength and plastic strain of Co-Mo-B ternary BMGs were 4630-5400 MPa and 0.8-5.1%, respectively. The intrinsic strengthening mechanism was the network-like atomic configurations that could act as the origins for high resistance against plastic yielding. The good plasticity was mainly attributed to the glassy alloys containing a large amount of randomly distributed free volume with a high Poisson's ratio.

AB To improve the mechanical properties of non-alkali glass substrate for display devices, B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2-MgO-SrO-MgF2 glass system was chosen and crystallized in this work. The effect of different nucleation-crystallization processes on the structure and properties of the glass and glass-ceramics was systemically studied. The results show the glass-ceramics have better properties than the parent glass due to the precipitation of cordierite, which do not only have higher mechanical strengths and Vickers hardness, but also lower densities. Most importantly, with the optimum nucleation-crystallization schedule (825 degrees C/10 h + 930 degrees C/9 h), the mechanical properties of the glass-ceramic are greatly improved (compressive strength of 702 MPa; bending strength of 265 MPa; Vickers hardness of 8.5 GPa). Besides, a lower density (2.495 g/cm(3)) and a high transmittance (81%) in the visible range can also be obtained. This work will provide a significant guidance for improving the mechanical properties of non-alkali glass substrates for display devices.

AB In the present work, a novel Cu46Zr40Ti8.5Al5.5 metallic glass is synthesized by melt spun technique and investigated for corrosion behavior at various molar concentrations in acidic, neutral and alkaline solutions (at different pH levels), using potentiodynamic polarization experiment and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Surface morphology and composition analysis after corrosion test were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Results indicate that corrosion resistance decreases with increase in chloride ion concentration in case of acidic and neutral media. However, in case of alkaline solution, corrosion resistance is found to be similar for pH 8 and pH 10, but is observed to decrease at pH 12. Melt spun sample was highly susceptible to pitting corrosion at higher molarity in acidic and neutral solution as observed from SEM analysis. EDS results indicate depletion of galvanically active metals (Al > Ti > Zr) from pit interior. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to study the influence of Al in corrosion behavior of the sample.

AB Glasses with compositions xNaCl-(50-x/2)K2SO4-(50-x/2)ZnSO4, x = 0 to 30 (in mol%), were characterized via vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray pair distribution function (xPDF) analysis. The xPDF's were modeled using Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR). From the modeled xPDF, the deconvoluted xPDFs were obtained along with cation-anion coordination numbers. The sulfate environment was elucidated through analysis of the vibrational spectroscopy paired with xPDFs. As determined via these techniques, the SO42- oxyanions remain as distinct tetrahedra and dominate the overall structure of these ionic glasses, even with up to 30 mol% addition of NaCl. Addition of NaCl lowers the glass transition temperature (T-g) of these materials and increases the temperature between T-g and the first crystallization temperature upon heating, as determined by differential thermal analysis (DTA). The composition-dependent xPDFs indicate that chloride ions are distributed equally and increasingly around Zn, K, and Na cations as x increases.

AB Phosphate-tellurite glasses exhibit magnetic properties, due to the presence of the small metallic Te colloids which were revealed in low field magnetic circular dichroism. These metallic colloids induce the red coloring of these glasses together with the absorbance in the visible region. The temperature dependence of the absorption spectrurn and the A-term in magnetic circular dichroism are specific for Te metallic nanoparticles, which results during the melting procedure over 1000 degrees C due to the conversion of Te4+ in Te-0 atoms. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy supports this fact due to the presence of small peaks as satellites in the region of Te 3d core-level spectrum. Quantification of these satellites compared with Te 3d(3/2) and 3d(5/2) peaks suggests a 14% concentration of Te metallic nanoparticles in these phosphate-tellurite glasses. The presence of metallic particles induces the crystallization effects of Te micrograins upon thermal treatments at higher temperatures.

AB We provide new viscosity data in the system SiO2-(Na,K)AlSiO4, for the nepheline-kalsilite and jadeite-leucite joins. We present a configurational entropy model for the viscosity of melts in the system as a function of Na/ (Na + K) and Al/(Al + Si) ratios. Our modelling indicates that: i) Viscosity data are reproduced well by a non ideal, symmetrical form of the parameters S-conf(T-g) and B-e,B- ii) Na-K mixing is the main source of additional entropy in the system based on the limited dependence of S-conf(T-g) and Be parameters on Al/(Al + Si) ratio, iii) A(e) likely varies as a function of Al/(Al + Si) ratio. Melt fragility in the system increases with increasing Al/(Al + Si) ratio and is greater for Na or K end-member melts than mixed melts. The viscosity of nominally fully-polymerized melts in the SiO2-(Na,K)AlSiO4 system can be modelled through chemical mixing, without explicit consideration of the important changes in structure related to changes in K/(Na + K) and Al/(Al + Si) ratios.

AB This paper reports a study on linear and nonlinear optical properties in a series of lithium-calcium tetraborate (CaLiBO) glasses in the presence of two rare earth ions, Tb3+ and Yb3+. The nonlinear index of refraction (n(2)) was determined in a wide wavelength range (470-1500 nm) through femtosecond Z-scan technique. Such results were modeled by KO approach, in which the optical nonlinearity was related to the oxygens present in the glasses. Also, the molar electronic polarizability evidenced that there is a strong influence of the polarizability of the rare earth ions in the nonlinear optical properties. Thus, we can infer that the cooperation of oxygens and the polarizability of rare earth ions are responsible for the nonlinearity present in the investigated vitreous system.

AB Recent advances in understanding the origins of glass-forming fragility in terms of fundamental bonding structure in network-forming glasses (NFGs) includes a proposition that the fragility index is uniquely defined by a single mean field parameter, a coarse-grained variant of the average bond density, < n(CG)>. This finding resonates with much earlier speculations, first voiced by Nemilov in an under-appreciated paper (Nemilov, 1966), that the fragility in oxide glasses is roughly correlated to the average bridging oxygen per network-forming polyhedron. Here, we provide an abbreviated look at the history of the fragility concept and its correlations with other glass properties as well as its association to the bond topology in network-forming glasses. While we acknowledge the precedence of Nemilov's work in this area (Nemilov, 1966, 1992, 2006, 2007), we also clarify important differences between his qualitative correlation and the more quantitative findings of recent work by ourselves and others.

AB Phosphate glass with a high transmission level in the visible and near-IR spectral regions doped with a high cerium concentration (up to 25 mol%) was synthesized and experimentally investigated in terms of applicability as a material for magneto-optical devices. Glass transition temperature was 590 degrees C. Glass refractive index varied between 1.5831 and 1.5884 depending on cerium content. The structure of the glass obtained was mostly metaphosphate with admixture of ultraphosphate complexes. It is shown that the maximum values of Verdet constant (11 rad/T/m at 1064 nm) are reached with increasing cerium concentration up to 25 mol%. The analysis proves the viability of the studied glass to create optical elements using the Faraday effect.

AB Cytosine DNA methylation (5mC) is an epigenetic mark that regulates gene expression in plant responses to environmental stresses. Zinc-finger protein (ZFP) is the largest family of DNA-binding transcription factors that also plays an essential role in eukaryote. In plant we have already identified and characterized different useful ZFP-genes. While, the main objective of this research was to observe and identify more targeted stress responsive genes of ZFPs epigenetically throughout genome in rice for the first time. A comprehensive correlation analysis was performed through methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-chip hybridization in rice under salt and osmotic stresses. High salinity and drought are two major abiotic hazards that are destroying the crop world-wide. As a result, Through-out genome 14 unique stress responsive transcription factors of ZFP-genes with varying level of methylation and expression under two conditions (control vs. stress) were isolated. All the identified genes were confirmed from different databases for their specific structure, cis-regulatory elements, phylogenetic analysis, and synteny analysis. Moreover, the tissue-specific expression patterns, and expression under abiotic and phytohormones stresses were also investigated. Phylogenetically all the genes were divided into 6 distinct subgroups with Arabidopsis and orthologous proteins were find-out through synteny analysis. Available RNA-seq data in response to various phytohormones provided hormone inducible gene expression profile. Through Reverse Transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) analysis tissue-specific expression in shoot and root over various time points against salt and osmotic stresses exhibited the diverse expression patterns of identified genes. Overall, the present study providing a foundation for in-depth characterization of identified genes and to further understand the epigenetic role of DNA methylation for genes expression and environmental stresses regulation in higher plant.

AB The role of epigenetics in development has garnered attention in recent years due to their ability to modulate the embryonic developmental gene expression in response to the environmental cues. The epigenetic mechanisms - DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs have a unique impact on vertebrate development. Zebrafish, a model vertebrate organism is being used widely in developmental studies due to their high fecundability and rapid organogenesis. With increased studies on various aspects of epigenetics in development, this review gives a glimpse of the major epigenetic modifications and their role in zebrafish development. In this review, the basic mechanism behind each modification followed by their status in zebrafish has been reviewed. Further, recent advancements in the epigenetic aspect of zebrafish development have been discussed.

AB Our comparative studies seek to understand the structure and function of ion channels in cartilaginous fish that can detect very low voltage gradients in seawater. The principal channels of the electroreceptor include a calcium activated K channel whose a subunit is Kcnma1, and a voltage-dependent calcium channel, Cacna1d It has also been suggested based on physiological and pharmacological evidence that a voltage-gated K channel is present in the basal membranes of the receptor cells which modulates synaptic transmitter release. Large conductance calcium-activated K channels (BK) are comprised of four alpha subunits, encoded by Kcnma1 and modulatory beta subunits of the Kcnmb class. We recently cloned and published the skate Kcnma1 gene and most of Kcnmb4 using purified mRNA of homogenized electroreceptors. Bellono et al. have recently performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on purified mRNA from skate electroreceptors and found several ion channels including Kcnma1. We searched the Bellono et al. RNA-seq repository for additional channels and subunits. Our most significant findings are the presence of two Shaker type voltage dependent K channel sequences which are grouped together as isoforms in the data repository. The larger of these is a skate ortholog of the voltage dependent fast potassium channel Kv1.1, which is expressed at appreciable levels. The second ortholog is similar to Kv1.5 but has fewer N-terminal amino acids than other species. The sequence for Kv1.5 in the skate is very strongly aligned with the recently reported sequence for potassium channels in the electroreceptors of the cat shark, S. retifer, which also modulate synaptic transmission. The latter channel was designated as Kv1.3 in the initial report, but we suggest that these channels are actually orthologs of each other, and that Kv1.5 is the prevailing designation. We also found a beta subunit sequence (Kcnab2) which may co-assemble with one or both of the voltage gated channels. The new channels and subunits were verified by RT-PCR and the Kv1.1 sequence was confirmed by cloning. We also searched the RNA-seq repository for accessory subunits of Kcnma1, and found a computer-generated assembly that contained a complete sequence of its beta subunit, Kcnmb2. Skate Kcnmb2 has a total of 279 amino acids, with 51 novel amino acids at the N-terminus which may play a specific physiological role. This sequence was confirmed by PCR and cloning. However, skate Kcnmb2 is expressed at low levels in the electroreceptor compared to Kcnma1 and skate Kcrunb1 is absent. The evolutionary origin of the newly described K channels and their subunits was studied by alignments with mammalian sequences, including human, and also those in related fish: the whale shark (R. typus), the ghost shark (C.milii), and (S. retifer). There are also orthologous K channels of the lamprey, which has electroreceptors. Tree building and bootstrap programs were used to confirm phylogenetic inferences. Further research should focus on the subcellular locations of these channels, their gating behavior, and the effects of accessory subunits on gating.

AB Cell morphology of the oleaginous fungus, Aspergillus oryzae BCC7051, was genetically engineered by disruption of non-essential genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis. Comparative phenotypic analysis of two disruptant strains defective either in alpha-1,3-glucan synthase 1 (Delta AoAgs1) or chitin synthase B (Delta AoChsB), and the wild type showed that the Delta AoAgs1 strain had no alterations in colonial growth and sporulation when grown on agar medium whereas the Delta AoChsB disruptant showed growth retardation and lower sporulation. However, tiny and loose pellets were found in the Delta AoAgs1 culture grown in liquid medium, where fungal pellet size was decreased by 35-50% of the wild type size. Further investigation of the Delta AoAgs1 mutant grown under stress-induced conditions, including high salt concentration, ionic strength and osmolarity, showed that its growth and development remained similar to that of the wild type. When cultivating the Delta AoAgs1 strain in a stirred-tank bioreactor, lipid production in terms of titer and productivity was significantly improved. As compared to the wild type, an increase of triacylglycerol and ergosterol contents with a proportional decrease in steryl ester content was observed in the Delta AoAgs1 strain. These results suggest that the morphologically engineered strain of A. oryzae is a robust cell chassis useful for exploitation in further production development of functional lipids with industrial significance.

AB Main conclusion
   Among 247 RsAP2/ERF identified, the majority of the 21 representatives were preferably expressed under drought and heat while suppressed under heavy metals, indicating their potential roles in abiotic stress responses and tolerance.
   APETALA2/Ethylene-Responsive factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factor (TF) is one of the largest gene families in plants that play a fundamental role in growth and development as well as biotic and/or abiotic stresses responses. Although AP2/ERFs have been extensively characterized in many plant species, little is known about this family in radish, which is an important root vegetable with various medicinal properties. The available genome provides valuable opportunity to identify and characterize the global information on AP2/ERF TFs in radish. In this study, a total of 247 ERF family genes were identified from the radish genome, and sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses classified the AP2/ERF superfamily into five groups (AP2, ERF, DREB, RAV and soloist). Motif analysis showed that other than AP2/ERF domains, other conserved regions were selectively distributed among different clades in the phylogenetic tree. Chromosome location analysis showed that tandem duplication may result in the expansion of RsAP2/ERF gene family. The RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that a proportion of AP2/ERF genes were preferably expressed under drought and heat stresses, whereas they were suppressed under the ABA and heavy metal stresses. These results provided valuable information for further evolutionary and functional characterization of RsAP2/ERF genes, and contributed to genetic improvement of stress tolerances in radish and other root vegetable crops.

AB Individual specific variable drug response against similar drugs raises a significant challenge for the effective and safe treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics is the branch which try to deal with these challenge by relating drug response to patient specific genome in order to better customize patient treatments. Pharmacogenomics based research focus on the whole genome, but since last few years after realizing the importance, it mainly centralized towards genes of pharmacological importance called pharmacogenes, and try to explore association between their variants and variable drug response in world's different population. This research was initiated with the resulted data from human genome based research projects and later on assisted by exome sequencing projects. Simultaneously, it was boost-up with the participation of various pharmacogenomics groups lead by PGRN. By realizing the significance of pharmacogenes, and their variant related information, in health science, scientific communities are already started to look for genes of pharmacogenomics importance with different aspect. This article aims to provide an inclusive insight on current state of knowledge of pharmacogenes, recent trends and progress in the understanding of the pharmacogenes and the implications for personalized medicine.

AB Opioids are widely used in the treatment of cancer related pain. They mainly exert their effects on opioid receptors. The most common opioid in the treatment of pain is morphine. Previous studies show that they may have effects on cancer cell behavior. These may include apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, inflammation and immune reactions. Tramadol, also an opioid is widely used in the treatment of cancer pain and is not well studied in cancer behavior. We aimed to investigate the effects of tramadol on cancer stem cells and metabolic changes in colon carcinoma cells.
   We used Co1o320 (ATCC, CCL-220), Colo741 (ECACC, 93052621) and HCT116 (ATCC, CCL-247) colon cancer cell lines. CD133 was considered colon cancer stem cell marker and used to sort CD133+ and CD133- cells by magnetic cell sorting. Dm (mitochondria-targeted therapeutics) technique was used to detect tramadol's cytotoxic effect on cells in the study groups. Cells were treated with 1 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg tramadol for 24 h at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.Caspase-3, Ki-67, Bcl-2 and VGEF distributions were performed using indirect immunoperoxidase staining for immunohistochemical analysis. The study showed that tramadol has triggering effect on apoptosis in Colo320 colon cancer stem cells.

AB Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are congenital conditions in which chromosomal, gonadal and sex is atypical. It is difficult to diagnose and manage patients with DSD in clinical practice, and the molecular etiology of DSD is still not completely understood. Here, we identified two novel pathogenic mutations from three unrelated Chinese patients with 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis (CGD) that is a clinical subgroup of DSD by whole exome sequencing. A novel mutation in the SRY gene (c.161delG) was identified in the first patient, and the second patient carried a novel missense mutation in the MAP3K1 gene (c.2117T > G). Bioinformatics analysis found that the deletion of SRY (c.161delG) led to a premature stop codon at amino acid 59 in the SRY protein, which resulted in lacking the DNA binding domain of SRY protein. Functional studies found that the missense mutation in the MAP3K1 gene (c.2117T > G) could interfere with the gene function through increasing the phosphorylation of the downstream targets of MAP3K1, ERK1/2 and p38, which resulted in reducing testis determining factor SOX9 expression and increasing ovary-promoting factor beta-catenin activity. According to the American college of medical genetics and genomics (ACMG) standards and guidelines, these mutations were categorized as "pathogenic" mutations. Thus, our findings provide two novel pathogenic mutations associated with 46,XY CGD that can improve the etiological diagnosis for 46,XY CGD.

AB Low pressure membranes, such as ultrafiltration (UF), are widely used in water treatment applications, including the pretreatment of reverse osmosis desalination. OF membranes produce a water of superior quality, in addition to reducing the footprint and the use of chemicals, compared to conventional methods. However, membrane fouling remains a major drawback, and frequent membrane cleanings are required to maintain the flux of water. and its quality. Typically, aftera series of backwashes using an UF permeate, a chemical cleaning process is applied to fully recover the membrane's permeability. However, frequent chemical cleanings negatively affect the lifetime of the membrane, the environment, and increase operational costs. Here, we introduce a novel cleaning method that uses a solution saturated with CO2 to clean the membranes through the backwash step. As the pressure drops, the CO2 solution becomes supersaturated, and bubbles start to nucleate within the membrane pores and on its surface, resulting in the effective removal of the deposited fouling material. These foulants are further helping the nucleation process as they are considered as imperfection sites with high creation and growth of bubbles. Investigations performed for different synthetic feed solutions of organic compounds (sodium alginate), colloidal matter (silica) and sea salts, at different concentrations, show that our new physical cleaning process using CO2 is more performant than the regular backwash using Milli-Q water. We obtain a 100% flux recovery, in a short time, even under severe irreversible fouling conditions. Based on these results, we conclude that replacing water by a solution saturated with CO2 for the backwash cleaning of filtration membranes provides significant benefits to existing cleaning processes, and represent a promising alternative for improving and lowering the frequency of conventional chemical cleaning methods.

AB Hexamethoxymethylmelamine (HMMM) is a crosslinker of melamine resins and widely used in the production of coatings and plastics, e.g. for cans, coils and automobiles. Despite its widespread application little is known about the occurrence of HMMM in municipal wastewater, the extent of its removal in wastewater treatment and the fate of transformation products that may be formed from it. A lab degradation experiment with activated sludge showed that HMMM is transformed but not mineralized under aerobic conditions. By LC-UV and LC-HRMS analyses 21 transformation products (TPs) were detected and tentatively identified, with modified di(methoxymethyl)amino side chains, and a pathway for their formation was proposed. The major TP after 28 days was methylol-1,3,5-triazin-2,4,6-triamin. LC-UV and LC-HRMS response of the TPs in the lab experiment was used to quantitatively assess the concentration of TPs also in environmental samples. In municipal wastewater HMMM and its two TPs TetraMMM and DiMMM added up to median concentrations of 2.8 mu g/l (7.5 nmol/L) in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and to 17.9 mu g/l (66 nmol/L) in another plant with a higher contribution of industrial wastewater. Their concentration increased in the WWTPs by a factor of 2-4, likely due to ongoing formation from HMMM-related precursor compounds. Also melamine concentrations increased in the four WWTPs (to 3-8 mu g/L), but this did not seem to be linked to HMMM transformation. In surface water affected by WWTP discharges HMMM and 12 TPs were determined, at median total concentrations of 5 mu g/L, with an even higher proportion of the TPs relative to HMMM compared to the WWTP effluents. During bank filtration HMMM, TetraMMM and DiMMM, together with some cationic TPs, were largely removed, while three TPs, all carrying one carbonylated side chain were eventually determined in raw waters used for drinking water production, in median concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mu g/L. It appears that HMMM, while falling under the exemptions of REACH registration, is a precursor for widely found persistent and mobile TPs, that can reach raw waters used for drinking water production.

AB Stormwater biofilters have been increasingly used to mitigate the impact of climate change on the export of contaminants including nitrate to water bodies. Yet, their performance is rarely tested under high intensity rainfall events, which are predicted to occur more frequently under climate change scenarios. We examined the potential of biochar to improve the resilience of woodchip biofilters under simulated high-intensity rainfall events and linked denitrification to biochar-mediated changes in hydrological (physical), chemical, and biological properties of woodchip biofilters. Results showed that nitrate removal capacity of woodchip biofilters decreased with increases in rainfall intensity or duration and decreases in antecedent drying time. However, adding biochar to woodchips significantly decreased the exhaustion rate of woodchips, only when the hydraulic residence time (HRT) was less than 5 h. At longer HRT (>5 h), the benefits of biochar became less apparent. We attributed the improved denitrification during high nitrate loading to biochar's ability to decrease dissolved oxygen in pore water and increase water holding capacity and retention of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate-all of which could increase nitrate utilization. Biochar increased the net microbial biomass but did not affect the relative abundance of denitrifying genes, which indicates that a shift in microbial biomass could not fully explain the observed increase in nitrate removal in biochar-augmented woodchip biofilters. Overall, the results showed that biochar could increase the resiliency of woodchip biofilters for denitrification in high intensity rainfall events, a worst-case scenario, thereby mitigating the water quality degradation during climate change.

AB Smectite clays are widely found in subsurface soils and waters. Although they strongly sequester tetracyclines (TCs), little is known about their reactions with these antibiotics under dark anoxic conditions. This study investigated the interactions between TCs and Fe-bearing smectite clays and the influences of environmental factors. Fe-bearing smectite clays were shown to significantly induce the transformation of TCs, including tautomerization, dechlorination, and dehydration. Moreover, the adsorbed TCs reduced the structural Fe(III) in clay particles to structural Fe(II) through electron transfer. The transformation of TCs was more readily induced by smectite clays with a higher rather than a lower Fe content. Tetrahedral Fe(III), and distorted cis- or trans-octahedral Fe(III), were more reactive as an electron acceptor than cis- octahedral Fe(III), as observed on the Mossbauer and MR spectra. A lower pH facilitated the adsorption of TCs through dimethyl-amino, amide, and conjugated -OH functional groups and induced a higher rate of TCs transformation. The transformation of chlortetracycline (CTC) was faster than that of oxytetracycline or tetracycline (TTC) due to -Cl substitution. The major transformation CTC products included keto-CTC, epi-CTC, iso-CTC, anhydro-CTC and TTC. Mixtures of these transformed products were found to have a higher acute toxicity than their parent compounds to Photobacterium phosphoreum T3. Our study revealed several previously overlooked interactions between TCs and clay particles that could cause these antibiotics to become unstable in the subsurface environment, with negative effects on the soil borne microbial community.

AB The ability of satellites to assess surface water quality indicators such as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) suggests that remote sensing could be a useful tool for evaluating water treatability metrics in considering potential drinking water supplies. To explore this possibility, 24 surface water samples were collected throughout Minnesota, USA with wide ranging values of CDOM (a(440); 0.41-27.9 m(-1)), dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 5.5-47.6 mg/L) and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254); 1.3-5.1 L/mg-M). Laboratory experiments were performed to quantify chlorine demand and the formation of two classes of halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBP5), trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAS), using the uniform formation conditions (UFC) test. Chlorine demand and THMUFC were linearly correlated with CDOM (R-2 = 0.97 and 0.91, respectively), indicating that CDOM is a useful predictor of these parameters. On the other hand, data comparing di- and tri-HAA(UFC) with CDOM were better fit by a logarithmic relationship (R-2 = 0.73 and 0.87, respectively), while mono-HAA(UFC) was linearly correlated with CDOM (R-2 = 0.46) but only for low-to moderately-colored waters (a(440) <= 11 m(-1)). The correlations relating chlorine demand and DBPUFC values with CDOM were coupled with satellite CDOM assessments to estimate chlorine demand and DBPUFC values for all surface waters larger than 0.05 km(2) in the state of Minnesota, USA. The resulting maps suggest that only 21.8% of Minnesota lakes would meet both the THM and HAA maximum contaminant levels, but only when pre-disinfection treatment removes 75% of DBP precursors. There are limitations to determining CDOM using satellites for high color surface waters (a(440)> 11 m(-1)), however, leading to underpredicted values for CDOM, chlorine demand, and DBPUFC. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential benefits of satellite remote sensing for assessing potential drinking water sources and water treatability metrics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Piped water supply in Guwahati covers less than 30% of the city's population for which the Government of India proposes four new water supply projects, but astonishingly, they faced vehement public protest. The reason for the protest was attributed to lack of trust and need of public representation in the governing body. Besides, public participation is not a mandatory clause in water supply projects and, hence, was not carried out a priori to the project implementation. In an effort to address this, the present study aims to develop a framework incorporating public participation as a mandatory clause in water supply projects. In doing so, secondary data was collected from studies worldwide on public participation in water supply projects and analyzed to identify critical success factors (CSFs). South-West Guwahati water supply project was taken up as a study area, and a semi-structured questionnaire was designed to generate primary data on public participation. Thematic analysis was employed to identify the CSFs from primary data influencing public participation in the project. Finally, a framework was formulated following the identified CSFs from primary and secondary data and the review of various theories on public participation. The framework is developed to achieve effective public participation in six levels viz. inform, educate, consult, involve, collaborate, and capacity building. Each level satisfies a set of CSFs and ultimately all CSFs addresses to deemphasize the effects of disincentives in water supply projects. Further, the framework was validated by 16 experts and received an exceptionally copacetic rating for all six validation aspects. Copacetic expert ratings demonstrated appropriateness, objectivity, replicability, practicality, reliability, and suitability of framework for water supply projects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, an omniphobic membrane was fabricated by electrospraying fluorinated zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) on the surface of an organosilane functionalized polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Our results revealed that the functionalized ZnO NPs membrane exhibited a rough hierarchical re-entrant morphology with low surface energy which allowed it to achieve high omniphobic characteristics. It was observed that the addition of 30% ZnO (w/w of PVDF-HFP) was found to be optimal and imparted a high repulsive characteristic. The optimized PVDF/ZnO(30)/FAS/PVDF-HFP referred as cPFP-30Z membrane exhibited a high contact angle values of 159.0 +/- 3.1 degrees, 129.6 +/- 2.2 degrees, 130.4 +/- 4.1 degrees and 126.1 +/- 1.2 degrees for water, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) saline solution (0.3 mM SDS in 3.5% NaCl), ethanol, and vegetable oil, respectively. The low surface energy and high surface roughness (Ra) of optimised membrane was assessed as 0.78 +/- 0.14 mN m(-1) and 1.37 mu m, respectively. Additionally, in contrast with the commercial PVDF membrane, the cPFP-30Z membrane exhibited superior anti-wetting/anti-fouling characteristics and high salt rejection performance (>99%) when operated with a saline oil solution (0.015 v/v) and SDS (0.4 mM) feed solutions.

AB Disinfection is a key step in drinking water treatment process to prevent water-borne infections. However, reactions between chlorine, one of the most common disinfectants, and natural organic matter (NOM) often lead to the formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts (DBPs). However, the cytotoxicity of some DBPs is still poorly understood. Such knowledge is critical for proper selection of disinfection processes. We investigated the effects of DBPs on mouse acute liver injury. The exacerbation of liver damage increased with the DBPs concentrations, likely due to the increased hepatic macrophages. Haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloketones (HKs) are more toxic to Human Hepatocellular (Hep3B) cells than trihalomethanes (THMs). Cytotoxicity of DBPs were governed by the halogen type (brominated DBPs > chlorinated DBPs) and the numbers of halogen atoms per molecule. Then, we used the pilot-scale WDS to study the best conditions for reducing the formation of DBPs. The result showed that the formation of DBPs followed the order: stainless-steel (SS) > ductile iron (DI) > polyethylene (PE) pipe. Higher flowrate promoted the formation of DBPs in all three pipes. The results suggest that the formation of DBPs in chlorine disinfection can be reduced by using PE pipes and low flow rate in water distribution systems (WDS). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although the enhancement of anammok performance for wastewater treatment due to the addition of small amount of acetate has been reported, discrepant metabolic responses of different anammox species have not been experimentally evaluated. Based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomic data, we investigated the competitiveness between two typical anammox species, Candidatus Jettenia caeni (J. caeni) and Candidatus Brocadia sinica (B. sinica), in anammox consortia under mixotrophic condition, where complex metabolic interactions among anammox bacteria and heterotrophs also changed with acetate addition. Contrary to J. caeni, the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium pathway of B. sinica was markedly stimulated for improving nitrogen removal. More acetate metabolic pathways and up-regulated AMP-acs expression for acetyl-CoA synthesis in B. sinica contributed to its superiority in acetate utilization. Interestingly, cross-feedings, including the nitrogen cycle, amino acid cross-feeding and B-vitamin metabolic exchange between B. sinica and other heterotrophs seemed to be enhanced with acetate addition, contributing to a reduction in metabolic energy cost to the whole community. Our work not only clarified the mechanism underlying discrepant responses of different anammox species to acetate, but also suggests a possible strategy for obtaining higher nitrogen removal rates in wastewater treatment under low C/N ratio.

ID BIOFILM FORMATION; BACTERIAL; LIMITATION; MODEL; RATIO
AB Membrane biofouling remains a significant challenge in seawater reverse osmosis desalination for drinking water production. This study investigated nutrient imbalance as the cause of biofouling in lab scale experiments and carried out a year-long field-testing at a seawater desalination pilot plant. Lab experiments showed that growth medium with excess of organic carbon (C) but with low nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accelerated the formation of bacterial biofilm. Balancing C to N and P ratios by adding N and P to growth medium increased the proliferation of free-living cells but reduced attached form of bacteria as biofilm. The cell excretion of excess C in the form of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) was considered as a strategy for nutrient storage for future use. Cell enzyme activity assays indicated some of the bacteria had enhanced enzyme activities to degrade polysaccharides in the absence of organic C in growth medium, possibly using EPS in the biofilm. A year-long field study indicated that accelerated biofouling of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes was associated with the elevated content of total organic carbon (TOC) in the intake seawater. Adding N and P to the intake seawater to balance the increase of TOC resulted in reduction of membrane biofouling. Microbial community analysis of the biofouling layer using 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated biofouling communities varied with seasonal changes. Dosing of N and P did not induce dramatic changes in the fouling microbial community growing on the membrane surface. The outcome of this work implies that membrane biofouling associated with the elevated concentration of TOC in intake seawater is caused by imbalance of C:N:P in the source seawater which occurs often during algal blooms. Addition of N and P to rebalance the nutrients can prevent accelerated SWRO membrane biofouling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB UV irradiation was reported to be able to degrade some kinds of DBPs, yet its influence on the toxicity of chlorinated water to mammalian cells remains unknown. This study systematically investigated the influence of low-pressure UV irradiation on the DBPs and toxicity of chlorinated drinking water (DW) and reclaimed water (RW). The apparent first-order rate constant (k(obs)) of degradation kinetics of known DBPs increased with the increased Br substitutions. Haloacetonitriles were identified as toxicity drivers among the detected DBPs, which even contributed more to the toxicity after UV irradiation, mainly due to the refractory bromochloroacetonitrile (BCAN) and dichloroacetonitrile (dCAN). Both total organic halogen, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were significantly removed under UV irradiation, with the removal rate of 22.9%-41.7% for cytotoxicity and a higher rate of 33.1%-55.5% for genotoxicity under 2400 mJ/cm(2) irradiation. UV irradiation significantly decreased the UV254. SUVA(254) and fluorescence intensity (FLU) of chlorinated water. Results from high performance size exclusion chromatography revealed that chlorinated DW mainly contained high molecular weight (MW) compounds (>1000 Da) while chlorinated RW mainly contained lower MW compounds (100-500 Da). Chromophores and fluorophores in compounds of 100-500 Da increased in chlorinated DW while decreased in chlorinated RW under UV irradiation. Both the removal of UV254, SUVA(254), FLU, MW-based UV254 (>1000 Da) and MW-based FLU (each fractions) were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with the removal of toxicity under UV irradiation. The UV254 of chlorinated water was recommended as the optimal surrogate for toxicity removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The treatment of harmful algal blooms (HABs) by in-situ flocculation is an emerging technology capable of efficiently removing HABs from natural waters. However, differences in salinity, pH and algal species in freshwaters and seawaters can influence the flocculation treatment. In this study, we developed a bicomponent modified soil using amphoteric starch (AS) and poly-aluminium chloride (PAC) in order to effectively flocculate microalgae under broad salinity conditions. Specifically, the impacts of water salinity (0-3.3%), pH (3-11), and algal species (Microcystis aeruginosa and marine Chlorella sp.) were investigated in order to evaluate efficiency, dosage and mechanisms of algae flocculation. The results showed that AS-PAC modified soils possessed excellent resistance to salinity change due to the anti-polyelectrolyte effect of AS, which contributed to 99.9% removal efficiency of M. aeruginosa in fresh and saline waters, and Chlorella sp. in marine water, respectively. The dosage of the flocculant modifier was only 10-20% of that of another proven modifier (i.e. Moringa oleifera), which substantially reduced the material cost. The high salinity tolerance of algal flocculation by the AS-PAC modified soil was attributed to the synergistic processes of charge neutralization and netting-bridging. Thus, this study has developed a universal flocculant and revealed fundamental mechanisms for the mitigation of HABs under broad salinity conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater is a major drinking water resource, but its quality is threatened by a broad variety of anthropogenic micropollutants (MPs), originating from agriculture, industry, or households, and undergoing various transformation processes during subsurface passage. To determine a worst case impact of pesticide application in agriculture on groundwater quality, a target and suspect screening for more than 300 pesticides and more than 1100 pesticide transformation products (TPs) was performed in 31 Swiss groundwater samples which predominantly originated from areas with intensive agriculture. To assess additional urban contamination sources, more than 250 common urban MPs were quantified. Most of the screened pesticide TPs were experimentally observed by the pesticide producers within the European pesticide registration. To cover very polar pesticide TPs, vacuum-assisted evaporative concentration was used for enrichment, followed by liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). Based on intensity, isotope pattern, retention time, and in silico fragmentation, the suspect hits were prioritised and verified. We identified 22 suspects unequivocally and five tentatively; 13 TPs are reported here for the first time to be detected in groundwater. In 13 out of 31 groundwater samples, the total concentration of the 20 identified and quantified suspects (1 pesticide and 19 pesticide TPs) exceeded the total concentration of the 519 targets (236 pesticides and TPs; 283 urban MPs) for which we screened. Pesticide TPs had higher concentrations than the parent pesticides, illustrating their importance for groundwater quality. The newly identified very polar chlorothalonil TP R471811 was the only compound detected in all samples with concentrations ranging from 3 to 2700 ng/L Agricultural MP concentration and detection frequency correlated with agricultural land use in the catchment, except for aquifers, where protective top layers reduced MP transport from the surface. In contrast to agricultural MPs, urban MPs displayed almost no correlation with land use. The dominating entry pathway of urban MPs was river bank filtration. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To properly design reverse electrodialysis (RED) stacks, modeling of ion transport and prediction of power generation on the single RED stack are very important. Currently, the Nernst-Planck equation is widely adopted to simulate ion transport through IEMs. However, applying typical Nernst-Planck equation is not proper to analyze ion transport through the heterogeneous thin-composite pore-filling membrane because of the non-conductive site in the membrane matrix. Herein, we firstly introduced modified Nernst-Planck equation by addressing conductive traveling length (CTL) to simulate the ion transport through the thin-composite pore-filling membranes and the performance of a single RED stack with the same membranes. Also, 100 cell-pairs of RED stacks were assembled to validate modified Nernst-Planck equation according to the flow rate and membrane types. Under the OCV condition, the conductivity of the effluents was measured to validate the modified Nernst-Planck equation, and differences between modeling and experiments were less than 1.5 mS/cm. Theoretical OCV and current density were estimated by using modified Nernst-Planck equation. In particular, hydrophobicity on the surface of the heterogeneous membrane was considered to describe ion transport through the pore filling membranes. Moreover, power generation from RED stacks was calculated according to the flow rate and the number of cell pairs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in river water dynamically changes with respect to its major sources during heavy rain events. However, there has been no established tool to estimate the relative contributions of different organic sources to river water DOM. In this study, the evolution in the contributions of ten different organic matter (OM) sources to storm water DOM was explored with a selected urban river, the Geumho River in South Korea, during storm events via an end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) based on fluorescence indices and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). The OM source materials included treated effluent, road runoff, groundwater, topsoil, deep soil, leaves, reeds, riparian plants, attached algae, and suspended algae. The EMMA results provided quantitative estimates of the variations in the dominant OM sources with the progress of storms. Treated effluent was the prevailing source at the beginning period of the storm, while topsoil, leaves, riparian plants, and groundwater predominated during and after the peak period. The fluorescence indices-based evaluation was consistent with the statistical comparison of the molecular formulas derived from FT-ICR-MS conducted on the ten potential OM sources and the storm samples. The observed variations in the OM sources agreed with the typical characteristics of urban rivers in connection with anthropogenic inputs and the impact of surrounding impervious surfaces. This study demonstrates the application of intuitive and facile tools in estimating the relative impacts of OM sources in urban watersheds. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study assessed the influence of substrate type on pollutants removal, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) fate and bacterial community evolution in up-flow microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands (UCW-MFC) with graphite and Mn ore electrode substrates. Better COD removal and higher bacterial community diversity and electricity generation performance were achieved in Mn ore constructed UCW-MFC (Mn). However, the lower concentration of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and the total abundances of ARGs were obtained in the effluent in the graphite constructed UCW-MFC (s), which may be related to higher graphite adsorption and filter capacity. Notably, both reactors can remove more than 97.8% of ciprofloxacin. In addition, significant negative correlations were observed between SDZ, COD concentration, ARG abundances and bacterial a-diversity indices. The LEfse analysis revealed significantly different bacterial communities due to the substrate differences in the two reactors, and Geobacter, a typical model electro-active bacteria (EAB), was greatly enriched on the anode of UCW-MFC (Mn). In contrast, the relative abundance of methanogens (Methanosaeta) was inhibited. PICRUSt analysis results further demonstrated that the abundance of extracellular electron transfer related functional genes was increased, but the methanogen function genes and multiple antibiotic resistance genes in UCW-MFC (Mn) anode were reduced. Redundancy analyses indicated that substrate type, antibiotic accumulation and bacterial community were the main factors affecting ARGs. Moreover, the potential ARG hosts and the co-occurrence of ARGs and intI1 were revealed by network analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Algal-derived organic matter (AOM) from algal blooms in water supply systems contains dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) among other constituents. The DON and DOC are disinfection by-product (DBP) precursor compounds, and must be well characterised to facilitate effective removal, thus minimising DBP formation during disinfection. While DOC character has been studied extensively, DON analysis suffers from inaccuracies due to sample pre-treatment and instrument sensitivities. A liquid chromatography method that combines size exclusion chromatography with highly sensitive organic carbon and nitrogen detectors (LC-OCND) has been widely adopted for DOC analysis; however, its potential for application for DON charactersation has been suggested as a viable alternative to existing DON characterisation techniquesnot been assessed despite its potential. Hence, the aim was to compare the effectiveness of conventional total dissolved N-dissolved inorganic N (TN-DIN), and LC-OCND methods for analysing DON in AOM. A suite of N-containing model compounds representative of DON and AOM extracted from Chlorella vulgaris CS-42/7 and Microcystis aeruginosa CS-555/1 were used to evaluate the techniques. The DON of both model compounds and AOM was first analysed using the conventional method and, then, via LC-OCND. It was observed that LC-OCND had a better precision for DON when TN contained more DIN. LC-OCND provided direct quantitative measurements for bulk and fractionated DON and DIN, with little interference caused by DIN. Additionally, LC-OCND provided information on MW distribution and protein content of the AOM. For example, LC-OCND results showed that M. aeruginosa AOM contained more HMW material than C vulgaris AOM. However, as LC-OCND uses UV oxidation, it could not completely oxidise complex aromatic structures, and thus had a lower recovery for HMW model compounds and algal DON in comparison to the conventional method that used high temperature catalytic oxidation. Overall, it is advised that a combination of LC-OCND and TN analysis be used to provide a more detailed characterisation of N-containing AOM and other similar HMW aquatic NOM samples.

AB Identifying high-risk storm-flow pollution intervals in an urban watershed is critical for watershed pollution control decision-making. High-risk pollution intervals of storm-flow are defined as storm-flow intervals that contribute more than the background pollutant load, and whose load contribution rank in the top 20%. However, the identification of high-risk pollution intervals is difficult due to variations in the flow-concentration relationship among rain events, uncertainty inherent in stormwater quality data, and physically-based stormwater models requiring a substantial number of parameters. A new method for identifying high-risk pollution intervals during different rain events is proposed. A dataset of the urban watershed located in Shenzhen, southern China, was used to demonstrate the proposed method. A "cut-pool" strategy was initially used to pre-process the dataset for maximizing valuable information hidden in existing datasets and to investigate the impact of rainfall on flow-concentration relationships. Gaussian cloud distribution was then introduced to capture the trend, dispersing extent and randomness of stormwater quality data at any flow interval. Interval Overlapping Ratio (IOR) and Load contribution of storm-flow high-risk pollution intervals was used to assess the performance of the method. Results show that storm-flow high-risk Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) pollution intervals of the Shiyan watershed was 0.5-1.5 mm under light rain (0-13 mm), 1-3 mm under moderate rain (13-27 mm) and 5-7 mm under heavy rain (27-43 mm). The accuracy of the identified high-risk pollution intervals (10R) was 63 66% under light rain, 64-67% under moderate rain. Moreover, COD load can be reduced by 44-48% with high-risk storm-flow under light rain; 43-49% under moderate rain; 32% under heavy rain. This method is very useful for effectively controlling storm-flow pollution on an urban catchment scale. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemical oxidation is widely used for water and wastewater treatment. Anodic material is crucial and the shape-tailored (001)-exposed TiO2 has been proven to be an ideal electrode material for pollutant oxidation. In this work, the electrochemical treatment of wastewater containing typical p-substituted phenols by facet-tailored TiO2 is studied in terms of efficiency, characteristics and mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that the anodic oxidation of p-substituted phenols becomes more difficult with the increasing Hammett's constant (sigma) of phenols, while their degradation rates (k) increase continuously with the initial surface concentration (Gamma). Phenols are degraded mainly by surface-bound center dot OH and direct electron transfer on the TiO2/Ti electrode, rather than by bulk-free center dot OH suspended in the aqueous phase. Theoretical calculations reveal that the surface-bound center dot OH-mediated oxidation mechanism is attributed mainly to the strong surface bond strength between shape-tailored TiO2 and water molecule as well as the reactive center dot OH. Such strong interactions are associated with the higher density of atomic steps, edges and kinks of low-coordinate surface atoms with a large number dangling bonds on the high-energy (001) polar facet. For practical treatment of real wastewater with different matrixes, the facet-tailored TiO2/Ti electrode exhibits both a high efficiency and a fast kinetics. Our findings provide a new chance to degrade phenolic pollutants in wastewater and offer atomic-scale insights into the preparation, modification and application of TiO2-based anodic materials for electrochemical water treatment.

AB Air valve failure can cause air accumulation and result in a loss of carrying capacity, pipe vibration and even in some situations a catastrophic failure of water transmission pipelines. Air is most likely to accumulate in downward sloping pipes, leading to flow regime transition in these pipes. The flow regime identification can be used for fault diagnosis of air valves, but has received little attention in previous research. This paper develops a flow regime identification method that is based on support vector machines (SVMs) to evaluate the operational state of air valves in freshwater/potable pipelines using pressure signals. The laboratory experiments are set up to collect pressure data with respect to the four common flow regimes: bubbly flow, plug flow, blow-back flow and stratified flow. Two SVMs are constructed to identify bubbly and plug flows and validated based on the collected pressure data. The results demonstrate that pressure signals can be used for identifying flow regimes that represent the operational state (functioning or malfunctioning) of air valves. Among several signal features, Power Spectral Density and Short-Zero crossing Rate are found to be the best indictors to classify flow regimes by SVMs. The sampling rate and time of pressure signals have significant influence on the performance of SVM classification. With optimal SVM features and pressure sampling parameters the identification accuracies exceeded 93% in the test cases. The findings of this study show that the SVM flow regime identification is a promising methodology for fault diagnosis of air valve failure in water pipelines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, the kinetics of bisphenol S (BPS) degradation in the presence of peroxydisulfate (PDS) or dissolved oxygen (DO) in ultrasound (US) system were investigated. For PDS (US/PDS), increased PDS concentration result in faster BPS degradation, but the enhancement was not remarkable with multiplying PDS dosages. Therefore, heterogeneous PDS activation model based on a Langmuir-type adsorption mechanism was proposed to explain the trait of BPS abatement. The equilibrium constant of PDS (K-pDs) was calculated to be 2.91 x 10(-4)/mu M, which was much lower than that of BPS, suggesting that PDS was hard to adsorb on the gas-liquid interface of the cavitation bubble following by activation. Besides, the formation of center dot OH and SO4 center dot- in US/PDS system was reinvestigated. The result showed that SO4 center dot- rather than center dot OH was the predominant radical, which was quite different from previous study. Dissolved oxygen largely improve the degradation of BPS in US system and center dot OH rather than Or was proved to be the main reactive oxygen species (ROS). The improvement of center dot OH generation possibly caused by the reaction of DO with center dot H so that it cannot recombine with center dot OH. The transformation of the BPS in US system mainly included BPS radical polymerization, hydroxylation and hydrolysis. Frustratingly, the acute toxicity assay of Vibrio fischeri suggests that the degradation products of BPS are more toxic. These results will improve the understanding on the activation mechanisms of PDS and the role of dissolved oxygen play in US. Further investigations may need to explore other treatment ways of BPS and evaluate the acute toxicity of degradation products. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved:

AB Mass transfer from nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) to entrapped air induced by a fluctuating water table commonly occurs in residual NAPL zones in aquifers. Gas bubble expansion and vertical migration due to interphase mass transfer could facilitate the upward transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the aquifer and result in higher mass fluxes into a building relative to those of diffusion-limited (D-L) VOC transport. However, the current vapor intrusion models have not considered bubble migration. In this study, an analytical solution of bubble-facilitated (B-F) VOC transport in the unsaturated-saturated zone was developed. The analytical solution was tested by a numerical solution using the finite difference method. Sensitivity analyses of model parameters were implemented to understand the VOC transport behaviors. The effects of bubble migration on vapor intrusion pathway completion time (t(c)) and the attenuation factor (AF) were investigated by comparison with the D-L VOC transport model. The results indicate that the D-L model significantly overestimates the tc and underestimates the AF because the model neglects the impacts of bubble migration. Therefore, one may make an inappropriate decision and set up an inappropriate response action schedule if using the D-L model to assess the risk of bubble-facilitated vapor intrusion. The analytical solution was applied to a laboratory experiment. The analytical model managed to interpret the laboratory experiment data, showing that the mass flux of B-F VOC transport is two orders of magnitude higher than that of D-L VOC transport.

However, its application under low-flow conditions (10(-5) to 0.01 ms(-1)) - as encountered in hyporheic zones has been scarcely reported.-In this study, 3 novel passive sampler configurations were developed for the monitoring of (semi-)polar organic pollutants and related transformation products across the water sediment interface and thus across varying hydrodynamic conditions. Their design was inspired by Chemcatcher and diffusive gradients in thin films for organics. To determine the most optimal sampler design, an uptake experiment was completed involving the 3 novel passive sampler configurations and a reference Chemcatcher in polar configuration. The experiments consisted of a circular flume that simulated the main channel of a stream and an aquarium with stagnant water that represented the underlying hyporheic zone. The systems were exposed to 192 organic pollutants at environmental concentrations, and the samplers were then collected, extracted and analyzed using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry after 2, 6 and 14 days. The configuration that was most insensitive to different hydrodynamic conditions consisted of a reversed-phase sulfonated styrenedivinylbenzene disk as the receiving phase that was covered by an agarose diffusion gel and topped with a polyethersulfone membrane filter. To further evaluate its environmental application, samplers were installed downstream of a sewage treatment plant located at an urban stream in Berlin, Germany (Erpe). The samplers were mounted on custom-made holders which were subsequently embedded in the stream bed to position samplers above (0.30 m) and within the sediment (-0.15/-0.30/-0.45 m) for 11 days. Target and suspect screening workflows were then applied to identify common concentration patterns and link parent attenuation to transformation product formation. A total of 104 concentration profiles were determined, suggesting the efficiency of the proposed sampling strategy in the water sediment interface. Valsartan acid was the only known transformation product indicative of hyporheic zone-driven attenuation as its concentration in porewater by far exceeded its concentration in surface water. Similar patterns were observed for a larger list of suspected transformation products, of which a sotalol transformation product was tentatively identified. Overall, the established sampling methodology can be effectively used to quantify organic contaminants during low-flow conditions and is suitable for the characterization of attenuation patterns of organic pollutants in hyporheic zones.

AB Three-dimensional electrochemical reactor (3DER) is a highly efficient technology for refractory wastewater treatment. Particle electrodes filled between anode and cathode are the core units of 3DER, determining the treatment efficiency of wastewater. However, particle electrodes deactivation due to catalytic sites coverage seriously impedes the continuous operation of 3DER. In this work, granular sludge carbon (GSC) particle electrodes being resistant to deactivation are fabricated by pyrolyzing the mixture of waste sludge, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and copper tailings, whose performances are evaluated by degrading rhodamine B (RhB) wastewater in a continuous-flow 3DER. Results indicate that hierarchical-pore structure comprising macro-, meso-, and micropores is developed in GSC-10-CTs by doping 10g PMMA and 5g copper tailings into 100g waste sludge. PMMA contributes to construct macropores, which is essential for the mass transfer of RhB into GSC particle electrodes of centimeter size. Copper tailings promote the formation of meso- and micro-pores in GSCs, as well as improving the electrochemical properties. Consequently, GSC-10-CTS packed 3DER exhibits the highest removal efficiency and lowest energy consumption for RhB treatment. In addition, the compressive strength of GSC-10-CTs is enhanced by copper tails, that is crucial to fill into 3DER as particle electrodes. The high efficient and cost-effective GSC-10-CTs fabricated by waste materials have the potential of substituting commercial granular activated carbon catalysts in the future, consequently promoting the application of 3DER in wastewater treatment.

AB Recent advances in mechanistic modeling of vegetated filter strips (VFS) have made it possible to incorporate VFS mitigation into environmental exposure assessments (EEAs). However, outside of fixed efficiency approaches, there are no widely adopted and standardized procedures for incorporating VFS quantitative mitigation into long-term, higher-tier EEAs. A source of hesitation involves the use of empirical equations for predicting pesticide trapping by the VFS. A recent study evaluated existing empirical equations and a mechanistic mass-balance approach using the most extensive field database available of VFS pesticide efficiency from single-event storms. That study concluded that an updated empirical equation (Sabbagh equation) and a mechanistic mass-balance approach performed reasonably well. The objective of this research was to study the effect of upscaling the VFS trapping equations from single events into long-term EEAs. The U.S. EPA Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) model linked with the Vegetative Filter Strip MODeling system (VFSMOD) long-term EEA modeling framework (30 yr) was updated to incorporate the alternative trapping equations and tested VFS mitigation results under contrasting agroecological settings with varying erosion/sediment transport conditions. Differences in both acute and chronic 90th percentile estimated environmental exposure concentrations (EECs) were relatively small when comparing predictions using the four pesticide trapping equations. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) also indicated that selection of a specific trapping equation for predicting EECs was less important than other important input factors such as the VFS length and pesticide properties. However, in terms of the percent reductions in EECs, the choice of pesticide trapping equation was as important as the VFS length. This research builds upon the conclusion of previous single-event studies that the mechanistic mass-balance and refit Sabbagh empirical equation were both valid for EEAs. The mass balance approach represents a reasonable option for regulatory agencies that prefer mechanistic approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Characterization of microbial communities using high-throughput amplicon sequencing is an emerging approach for microbial source tracking of fecal pollution. This study used SourceTracker software to examine temporal and geographical variability of fecal bacterial community profiles to identify pollutant sources in three freshwater catchments in sub-tropical Australia. Fecal bacterial communities from 10 animal species, humans, and composite wastewater samples from six sewage treatment plants were characterized and compared to freshwater samples using Illumina amplicon sequencing of the V5-V6 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Source contributions were calculated in SourceTracker using new fecal taxon libraries as well as previously generated libraries to determine the effects of geographic and temporal variability on source assignments. SourceTracker determined 16S rRNA bacterial communites within freshwater samples, shared taxonomic similarities to that of wastewater at low levels (typically <3%). SourceTraker also predicted occasional fecal detection of deer and flying fox sources in the water samples. No significant differences in source contributions were observed within sequences from current and previously characterized fecal samples (P >= 0.107). However, significant differences were observed between previously characterized and newly characterized source communities (ANOSIM P <= 0.001), which shared <15% community composition. Results suggest temporal instability of fecal taxon libraries among tested sources and highlight continual evaluation of community-based MST using confirmatory qPCR analyses of marker genes.

AB The environmental behaviors and risks associated with graphene oxide (GO, a popular 2D nanomaterial) have attracted considerable attention. GO released to aquatic systems will most likely interact with ubiquitous nanocolloids (Nc) in surface water. However, the effects of Nc on the fate and risk of GO remain largely unknown in water. Herein, the binding of Nc onto GO was investigated via electron microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, 2D correlation spectroscopy and biolayer interferometry. The results revealed that electron charge transfers, hydrophilic effects and pi-pi stacking contributed to a strong affinity (K-D = 5.6 nM) and high adsorption capacity (159.8 mg/g) of Nc onto the GO surface. Moreover, GO nanosheets transformed to a scroll morphology or multiple GO particles bridging by Nc, which remarkably reduced the aggregation and sedimentation rates after binding with Nc. Interestingly, co-exposure with Nc greatly alleviated the toxicity (e.g., tail malformation, yolk sac edema and oxidative stress) of GO to zebrafish embryos. Morphological and structural alterations of GO after binding to Nc contributed to the mechanisms for the antagonistic effects on the zebrafish embryos toxicity. The present work provides insights into the environmental fate and risk of GO by ubiquitous Nc in natural water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To minimize the aesthetic and hygienic concerns regarding tap water (e.g., odor, taste, suspended solids, and microorganisms), point-of-use (POU) water dispensers and filters are used in households worldwide. However, the POU water dispenser itself can adversely impact water quality. This study investigated the bacterial growth through a POU water dispenser fed with chlorinated tap water; specifically, the heterotrophic plate count increased from 0.01 to 20.01 x 10(3) of colony-forming units per ml. The BioMig test, which evaluates the biostability of polymeric materials based on the migration potential and the biofilm formation potential, was firstly applied for the water dispenser system. Organic migration and biofilm formation varied by the polymer type used in the water dispenser components (e.g., tubing, fittings, and reservoir). Assimilable organic carbon migration in cold water (23 +/- 2 degrees C) was better correlated with the biofilm formation potential (R = 0.93) than that of warm water (60 +/- 2 degrees C) migration (R = 0.62). The most problematic test material was silicone based on assimilable organic carbon migration and biofilm formation, whereas approved materials such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride were relatively stable. Polymeric component examination of an actual POU water dispenser revealed highly accumulated biofilms on the silicone tube used in the device (118 x 10(3) CFU cm(-2)). The use of polymers with high biofilm formation should be minimized in water dispensers, whereas approved polymeric components contribute to biological stability in the dispensed drinking water.

AB Metabolic transformations have a major impact on the development of primary producers in aquatic systems and thus affect the dynamics of the entire aquatic food web. Furthermore, metabolic transformations contribute to the carbon budget and thereby influence CO2 emissions from aquatic systems. Several techniques have been developed that aim at an easy assessment of metabolic rates over long time periods in many systems. The O-18/16 technique, which utilizes the isotopic fractionation between O-18 and O-16 isotopes due to metabolic transformations, is receiving increasing popularity in studies comparing the metabolism in many different lakes and served as basis for the conclusions that production increases with increasing atmospheric CO2 and that surprisingly little terrestrial carbon is recycled in lakes of the arid circumpolar landscape. However, we demonstrate here that the steady state assumptions underlying the O-18/16 technique cause large uncertainties in the estimated metabolic rates. This conclusion is based on a sensitivity analysis using a numerical model of dissolved oxygen, DO, and of dissolved O-18, O-18(DO), but is also confirmed by published metabolic rates estimated from the O-18/16 and the diel O-2 techniques. Metabolic rates obtained from the O-18/16 technique appear unsuited for correlation analyses between lakes but may provide reasonable estimates in systems with low and long-term stable production. In addition we illustrate that the combination of few O-18 measurements with the diel O-2 technique and an inverse fitting procedure can improve estimates of metabolic rates and in particular of respiration rates.

AB Deionization devices that use intercalation reactions to reversibly store and release cations from solution show promise for energy-efficient desalination of alternative water resources. Intercalation materials often display low electronic conductivity that results in increased energy consumption during desalination. Accordingly, we performed experiments to quantify the impact of the size and mass fraction of conductive additives and insulative active particles on the effective electronic conductivity, ionic conductivity, and hydraulic permeability of porous electrodes. We find that Ketjen black conductive additives with nodules <50 nm in diameter produce superior electronic conductivity at lower mass fractions than the larger carbon blacks commonly used in capacitive deionization. Hydraulic permeability and effective ionic conductivity depend weakly on carbon black content and size, though smaller active particles decrease hydraulic permeability. Based on these results we analyzed the energy consumption and salt removal rate of different electrode formulations by constructing an electrochemical Ashby plot predicting the variation of desalination performance with electrode transport properties. Optimized electrodes containing insulative Prussian blue analogue (PBA) particles were then fabricated and used in an experimental cation intercalation desalination (CID) cell with symmetric electrodes. For 100 mM NaCl influent energy consumption varied from 7 to 33 kJ/mol when current density increased from 1 to 8 mA/cm(2), approaching ten-fold increased salt removal rate at similar energy consumption levels to past CID demonstrations. Complementary numerical and analytical modeling indicates that further improvements in energy consumption and salt removal rate are attainable by enhancing transport in solution and within PBA agglomerates.

AB Iron and aluminium based coagulants are used in enormous amounts and play an essential role in urban water management globally. They are dosed at drinking water production facilities for the removal of natural organic matter. Iron salts are also dosed to sewers for corrosion and odour control, and at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for phosphate removal from wastewater and hydrogen sulfide removal from biogas. A recent laboratory study revealed that iron dosed to sewers is available for phosphate and hydrogen sulfide removal in the downstream WWTP. This study demonstrates for the first time under real-life conditions the practical feasibility and effectiveness of the strategy through a year-long full-scale investigation. Over a period of 5 months, alum dosing at similar to 190 kg Al/day to the bioreactor in a full-scale WWTP was stopped, while FeCl2 dosing at similar to 160 kg Fe/day in the upstream network was commenced. Extensive sampling campaigns were conducted over the baseline, trial and recovery periods to investigate sulfide control in sewers and its flow-on effects on phosphate in WWTP effluent, H2S in biogas, as well as on the WWTP effluent hypochlorite disinfection process. A plant-wide mass balance analysis showed that the Fe2+ dosed upstream was effectively used for P removal in the activated sludge tanks, with an effluent phosphate concentration comparable to that in the baseline period (i.e. with alum dosing to the bioreactor). Simultaneously, hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas decreased similar to 43%, from 495 +/- 10 to 283 +/- 4 ppm. No effects on biological nitrogen removal and disinfection processes were observed. Both effluent phosphate and H2S in biogas increased in the recovery period, when in-sewer dosing of FeCl2 was stopped. X-ray diffraction failed to reveal the presence of vivianite in the digested sludge, providing strong evidence that thermal hydrolysis prevented the formation of vivianite during anaerobic digestion. The latter limits the potential for selective recovery of Fe and P through magnetic separation. Overall, our study clearly demonstrates the multiple beneficial reuse of iron in a real urban wastewater system and urges water utilities to adopt an integrated approach to coagulant use in urban water management.

AB Progestins (PGs) are a group of steroid hormones known to have endocrine-disrupting effects. These compounds can enter the aquatic environment via the discharge of treated or untreated wastewater and the disposal of sludge from sewage treatment plants (STPs); thus, their removal in STPs are of great importance. The present study simultaneously investigated the occurrences and fates of 62 PGs in a municipal STP in Beijing, China. Progesterone (P) and its metabolites were found to be the predominant compounds, with total dissolved concentrations of 1866 ng/L in the influent. About 11 P metabolites were newly detected, accounting for 25-55% and 75-91% of the total concentrations in wastewater and sludge, respectively. For the other three groups of PGs derived from different parent compounds, P derivatives were first detected in the STP with the highest concentration in the wastewater and sludge, followed by 19-nortestosterone (NT) derivatives and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17 alpha-OHP) derivatives. The removal efficiencies in the dissolved phase of wastewater were relatively high for P and its metabolites (95-99%) and P derivatives (91-99%). And the relative persistence of NT (68-99%) and 17 alpha-OHP derivatives (79-99%) was observed during the wastewater treatment processes. Mass balance analysis showed that the lost mass proportions were as high as 41-99%, the mass fractions in sludge were in the range of 0-55%, and 0.24-25% of the initial mass loadings was present in the effluent. These results indicated that biodegradation was the major removal mechanism of PGs in the STP. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs) have increasing applications in the inactivation of microorganisms in water, air, food, and on surfaces. System designers currently have metrics for comparison of the microbial and energy efficiency of UV LEDs, but these have not included a time component. Without including the time efficiency of a UV LED, neither the fluence-basis nor the electrical-basis of comparison clarifies which UV LED wavelength and operating condition is optimal for a design space. This research explores microbial inactivation of UV LEDs at various wavelengths under continuous and pulsing operating conditions. Planktonic microorganisms of relevance to public water supplies and UV system design are included: E. coli and MS-2 for benchmarking against previous studies and P. aeruginosa which has not been studied in pulsed systems or for continuous and combined UV LED wavelengths.
   Pulsing UV LEDs at various duty rates (percent of cycle spent on) and frequencies (number of cycles per second) does not result in a statistically significant disinfection performance difference over the continuous light operation at that respective wavelength. UV LEDs emitting at peak wavelengths corresponding to the peak action spectrum of a microorganism are optimal on a fluence-basis, but these are typically less electrically efficient UV LEDs. System designers can compare the normalized microbial inactivation, electrical, and time efficiencies (E-NETO) of various UV LEDs; E-NETO >= 1 for a pulsing condition ensures equal or improved efficiency compared to the continuous light condition while expanding the lifetime of the UV LED and decreasing the size or cost of associated power supplies.

AB In this study, the formation of 17 N-chloramines from proteinogenic amino acids and HOCl was studied by direct kinetic method in the pH = 3-13 range. Thus, the uncertainties associated with the indirect methods used in some of the previous studies were eliminated. Each reaction proceeds according to an overall second order kinetics: v = - k [HOCl][R-NH2] and the rate constants are several times 10(7) M(-1)s(-1). A very slight correlation was found between the lgk and the pK(AA) of the amino acids. The results make possible to predict-the reactivity order of the amino acids toward HOCl under various conditions. A comparison of the parameters of activation indicates that the presence of a bulky substituent on the side chain close to the a-carbon atom decreases the strength of bonding between the reactants and make the structure more diffuse in the transition state. The chlorination of histidine proceeds via two pH dependent paths presumably leading to the formation of N-chloramine and a side chain chlorinated product. The latter compound may be involved in fast subsequent trans-chlorination reactions. The results presented here resolve earlier discrepancies in the literature and are relevant in chlorination water treatment technologies as well as in the interpretation of in vivo processes involving the formation of N-chloro amino acids in a wide pH range.

AB Sensor drift is commonly observed across engineering disciplines, particularly in harsh media such as wastewater. In this study, a novel stabilizing controller for nitrification of high strength ammonia solutions is designed based on online signal derivatives. The controller uses the derivative of a drifting nitrite signal to determine if nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are substrate limited or substrate inhibited. To ensure a meaningful interpretation of the derivative signal, the process is excited in a cyclic manner by repeatedly exposing the NOB to substrate-limited and substrate-inhibited conditions. The resulting control system successfully prevented nitrite accumulations for a period of 72 days in a laboratory-scale reactor. Slow disturbances in the form of feed composition changes and temperature changes were successfully handled by the controller while short-term temperature disturbances are shown to pose a challenge to the current version of this controller. Most importantly, we demonstrate that drift-tolerant control for the purpose of process stabilization can be achieved without sensor redundancy by combining deliberate input excitation, qualitative trend analysis, and coarse process knowledge.

AB A combined heterotrophic-sulfur-autotrophic system (CHSAS) was established to simultaneously reduce perchlorate and nitrate in water. In this system, the OH- produced by the acetate heterotrophic part (H-part) could be neutralized with the H+ produced by the sulfur autotrophic part (S-part); thus, the pH of the final effluent could keep neutral. In addition, the S-part could further reduce the pollutants and residual carbon from the H-part to achieve a high performance. For 19.62 +/- 0.30 mg/L ClO4- and 21.56 +/- 0.83 mg/L NO3--N in the influent, the operating parameters were optimal at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1.0 h and an acetate concentration of 70 mg/L. The removal efficiency of ClO4- and NO3- reached 95.43% and 99.23%, without secondary pollution caused by residual organic carbon. It was also revealed that sulfur (S-0) disproportionation can be inhibited by shortening the HRT and reducing the acetate dosage. The dominant heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were Thauera and Ferritrophicum, respectively, while Chlorobaculum was related to S disproportionation. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Chlorine is preferred over bisulfite for H2O2 quenching following UV-AOP
   drinking water treatment

AB Drinking water treatment using UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation typically results in residual H2O2 that requires quenching to minimize its interference with downstream processes. Chemical quenching using chlorine or bisulfite are options, but there is some uncertainty in the literature about the kinetics of the bisulfite reaction, with some reports quoting the reaction as fast, and others as slow. Part of the contradictory information may be due to interference in H2O2 analysis by bisulfite. An analytical method was developed to avoid this interference, in which monochloramine first selectively quenched bisulfite, and then H2O2 was measured spectrometrically using titanium(IV) oxysulfate for color development. The confirmatory experiments suggested that the bisulfite reaction with H2O2 is actually relatively slow, with a half-life in the order of hours to days depending on the pH and the reagent concentrations. As a result, within the typical pH range of drinking water treatment (e.g., 6-9), chlorine is preferred over bisulfite as the H2O2 quenching agent on the basis of reaction kinetics. However, a decrease in pH will lead to an increase in the bisulfite-H2O2 reaction rate along with a decrease in the Cl-2-H2O2 reaction rate, such that at pH <5.7 bisulfite is the faster reagent. Both bisulfite and chlorine were observed to react with H2O2 following a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 in the natural water matrix tested. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The coupling of high frequency data of water quality with physically based models of river systems is of great interest for the management of urban socio-ecosystems. One approach to exploit high frequency data is data assimilation which has received an increasing attention in the field of hydrology, but not for water quality modeling so far. We present here a first implementation of a particle filtering algorithm into a community-centered hydro-biogeochemical model to assimilate high frequency dissolved oxygen data and to estimate metabolism parameters in the Seine River system. The procedure is designed based on the results of a former sensitivity analysis of the model (Wang et al., 2018) that allows for the identification of the twelve most sensible parameters all over the year. Those parameters are both physical and related to micro-organisms (reaeration coefficient, photosynthetic parameters, growth rates, respiration rates and optimal temperature). The performances of the approach are assessed on a synthetic case study that mimics 66 km of the Seine River. Virtual dissolved oxygen data are generated using time varying parameters. This paper aims at retrieving the predefined parameters by assimilating those data. The simulated dissolved oxygen concentrations match the reference concentrations. The identification of the parameters depends on the hydrological and trophic contexts and more surprisingly on the thermal state of the river. The physical, bacterial and phytoplanktonic parameters can be retrieved properly, leading to the differentiation of two successive algal blooms by comparing the estimated posterior distribution of the optimal temperature for phytoplankton growth. Finally, photosynthetic parameters' distributions following circadian cycles during algal blooms are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In complex hydrogeological settings little is known about the extent of temporally varying redox conditions and their effect on aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. This study aims to assess the impact of changing redox conditions over time on aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation in a fractured bedrock aquifer using stable isotope methods. To that end, four snapshots of highly spatio-temporally resolved contaminant and redox sensitive species concentrations, as well as stable isotope ratio profiles, were determined over a two-years time period in summer 2016, spring 2017, fall 2017 and summer 2018 in a toluene contaminated fractured bedrock aquifer. The concentration profiles of redox sensitive species and stable isotope ratio profiles for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) and sulfate (delta C-13(DIC), delta S-34(SO4), delta O-18(SO4)) revealed that the aquifer alternates between oxidising (spring 2017/summer 2018) and reducing conditions (summer 2016/fall 2017). This alternation was attributed to a stronger aquifer recharge with oxygen-rich meltwater in spring 2017/summer 2018 compared to summer 2016/fall 2017. The temporally varying redox conditions coincided with various extents of toluene biodegradation revealed by the different magnitude of heavy carbon (C-13) and hydrogen (H-2) isotope enrichment in toluene. This indicated that the extent of toluene biodegradation and its contribution to plume attenuation was controlled by the temporally changing redox conditions. The highest toluene biodegradation was observed in summer 2016, followed by spring 2017 and fall 2017, whereby these temporal changes in biodegradation occurred throughout the whole plume. Thus, under temporally varying recharge conditions both the core and the fringe of a contaminant plume can be replenished with terminal electron acceptors causing biodegradation in the whole plume and not only at its distal end as previously suggested by the plume fringe concept. Overall, this study highlights the importance of highly temporally resolved groundwater monitoring to capture temporally varying biodegradation rates and to accurately predict biodegradation induced contaminant attenuation in fractured bedrock aquifers.

AB Microplastics have been found to be ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems, providing a novel substrate for biofilm formation. Here, we incubated biofilm on microplastics and two natural substrates (rock and leaf) under a controlled environment to investigate the differences of microbial community structure, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles, and ARG microbial hosts between biofilms on three types of substrates. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene revealed that microplastic biofilm had a distinctive community structure. Network analyses suggested that microplastic biofilm possessed the highest node connected community, but with lower average path length, network diameter and modularity compared with biofilm on two natural particles. Metagenomic analyses further revealed microplastic biofilm with broad-spectrum and distinctive resistome. Specifically, according to taxonomic annotation of ARG microbial hosts, two opportunisitic human pathogens (Pseudomonas monteilii, Pseudomonas mendocina) and one plant pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae) were detected only in the microplastic biofilm, but not in biofilms formed on natural substrates. Our findings suggest that microplastic is a novel microbial niche and may serve as a vector for ARGs and pathogens to new environment in river water, generating freshwater environmental risk and exerting adverse impacts on human health.

AB A pH-responsive, charge switchable piperazine derivative, 1,4-bis(3-propane- sulphonate sodium)-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid disodium-sulfate (4), has been designed via a stepwise synthesis and proposed as a draw solute to remove arsenics (As-III, As-V) from water through forward osmosis (FO). Having multiple sulfonic groups, 4 generates a high osmotic pressure and produces a water flux as high as 58.4 LMH at a dilute concentration (0.24 M), surpassing most of the existing draw solutes in water transfer rate under the similar experimental conditions. Compound 4 at 0.24 M yields a water flux of 52.9 LMH with a 100% As-V rejection, and 57.8 LMH with a 96.0% As-III rejection when 50?ppm As-V or As-III as the corresponding feed, manifesting the best performance in arsenic removal and concurrent water recovery efficiency. Remarkably, being a polymeric configuration in water, 4 has a negligible solute loss in the FO process. 4 can be readily regenerated for reuse in FO by precipitation from its solution through acidification. The abundance in ionic groups and the pH-responsive property coupled with a supramolecular configuration make 4 an ideal draw solute for FO wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Intensive agriculture and urbanization have led to the excessive and repeated input of nitrogen (N) into soil and further increased the amount of nitrate (NO3-) leaching into groundwater, which has become an environmental problem of widespread concern. This review critically examines both the recent advances and remaining knowledge gaps with respect to the N cycle in the vadose zone-groundwater system. The key aspects regarding the N distribution, transformation, and budget in this system are summarized. Three major missing N pieces (N in dissolved organic form, N in the deep vadose zone, and N in the nonagricultural system), which are crucial for closing the N cycle yet has been previously assumed to be insignificant, are put forward and discussed. More work is anticipated to obtain accurate information on the chemical composition, transformation mechanism, and leaching flux of these missing N pieces in the vadose zone-groundwater system. These are essential to support the assessment of global N stocks and management of N contamination risks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The frequent occurrence of thallium (Tl) in surface water has led to the imposition of strict environmental regulations. The need for an overview of effective and feasible technology to remove Tl from water/wastewater has therefore become urgently. This review introduced the current available methods for Tl removal, including adsorption, oxidation-reduction precipitation, solvent extraction and ion exchange processes, and summarized their advantages and disadvantages. The results showed that a single treatment technology was difficult to remove Tl to a trace level of "mu g L-1", which required combined multi-technology to enhance the removal efficiency. In addition, the potential emergency and feasible technologies for Tl removal were recommended. However, several fundamental issues, such as the comparative toxicity of Tl(I) and Tl(III), the confliction of hydrolysis constants, the interference of complexant ligands as well as the influence of redox potential, were still needed to be addressed, since they would profoundly affect the selection of adopted treatment methods and the behavior of Tl removal. Future research efforts concerning the improvement of existing Tl removal technologies should be devoted to (a) developing multi-functional chemicals and adsorbents, non-toxic extractants, easy recovery ion exchange resin and high-efficient coupling technology for advanced treatment, (b) carrying out large-scale experiments and economic assessment for real wastewater, and (c) providing safe disposal treatment for the exhausted adsorption materials or sludge.

AB Reservoir operations affect both the quantity and quality of stored and discharged water. Hedging rules (HRs) are commonly used in water supply reservoir operations to ration water delivery and decrease water shortage risk. However, the increased carryover storage with hedging may aggravate reservoir eutrophication through complex effects on hydrodynamic, temperature, light, nutrient, and sediment conditions. The influencing mechanisms are unclear and require further investigation. This study applies a mathematical modeling approach to comparing the effects of standard operation policy (SOP) and HR, discussing the processes and driving factors, and exploring the relationship between water shortage and water quality indicators. We simulate reservoir operation by SOP and optimize HR to generate water supply schedules, and run a quasi-3D water quality model to simulate reservoir hydrodynamic conditions, nutrient cycles, water-sediment exchanges, and algal dynamics under various water supply schedules. The Danjiangkou Reservoir, the water source for China's South North Water Transfer Project, is used as a case study. The HR for this reservoir decreases its water shortage risk from 22% under SOP to 8%. Modeling results find that the HR increases sediment phosphorus (P) release by 285.3 tons (5.7%) annually as a consequence of extended reservoir submerged area and aggravated hypolimnetic hypoxia. Increased P release can support algal growth, but this effect is set off by the enhancement of light limiting effect caused by higher storages under HR, consequently decreasing the annual mean chlorophyll a concentration in the deep reservoir by 18%. The HR also improves the horizontal mixing of water by changing the hydraulic retention time and flow velocity field, which mitigates algal bloom risks in the surrounding shallow-water zones but deteriorates water quality of the release to downstream. The water quality analysis offers implications for reservoir managers to coordinate their efforts in mitigating risks of water shortage and water quality degradation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB High energy consumption is a critical problem for wastewater treatment systems currently monitored using conventional "single point" probes and operated with manual or automatic open-loop control strategies, exhibiting significant time lag. This challenge is addressed in this study by profiling the variation of three critical water quality parameters (conductivity, temperature and pH) along the depth of a reactor at high spatiotemporal resolution in a real-time mode using flat thin milli-electrode array (MEA) sensors. The profiling accurately captured the heterogeneous status of the reactor under transient shocks (conductivity and pH) and slow lingering shock (temperature), providing an effective dataset to optimize the chemical dosage and energy requirement of wastewater treatment systems. Transient shock models were developed to validate the MEA profiles and calculate mass transfer coefficients. Monte Carlo simulation revealed high-resolution MEA profiling combined with fast closed-loop control strategies can save 59.50% of energy consumption (Temperature and oxygen consumption controls) and 45.29% of chemical dosage, and reach 16.28% performance improvement over the benchmark (defined with ideal conditions), compared with traditional "single-point" sensors that could only monitor the entire system through a single process state. This study demonstrated the capability of MEA sensors to profile reactor heterogeneity, visualize the variation of water quality at high resolution, provide complete datasets for accurate control, and ultimately lead to energy-saving operation with high resilience.

AB Nickel phosphide (Ni2P) is an emerging efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution and water splitting. Herein, we report that Ni2P is also a promising catalyst for enhancing electrochemical dechlorination of chlorinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Amorphous Ni2P (ANP) mini-nanorod arrays were in-situ fabricated on nickel foam (NF) via a facile phosphidation process, and then used as a binder-free cathode for electrochemical dechlorination of trichloroacetic acid (TCAA). Results showed that ANP exhibited superior performance on electrochemical dechlorination of TCAA than other metal cathodes (e.g., NF and Pd/C). Scavenging experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) technique indicated that atomic H* was generated from water reduction through ANP catalysis, and primarily contributed to TCAA dechlorination. Indeed, the superhydrophilic surface of ANP favored electrocatalyst/electrolyte contact, and its low impedance further afforded rapid electron transport from the electrode to water or protons for atomic H* generation. The kinetic modelling and mass balance evaluation revealed the transformation mechanism of TCAA dechlorination. This study is among the first to develop ANP as a binder-free cathode for electrochemical dechlorination, and have important implications for eliminating chlorinated DBPs in water.

AB Purine and pyrimidines are present an important pool of dissolved organic nitrogen in aqueous medias and also precursors of disinfection byproducts. The degradation kinetics of cytosine and adenine-model pyrimidine and purine compounds-were investigated along with their transformation pathways leading to the formation of disinfection byproducts during two typical multi-barrier disinfection processes: UV irradiation and UV/chlorine pretreatment followed by post-chlorination. UV irradiation followed by post-chlorination enhanced the degradation of cytosine and adenine (by 17.1 and 26.1%, respectively), but it also generated more byproduct precursors compared to chlorination alone. The presence of reactive species in the UV/chlorine treatment greatly enhanced cytosine and adenine degradation (by 61.8 and 123.0%) but generated even more disinfection byproducts. Compared to 24 h chlorination, the concentrations of byproducts increased by up to 361.6% for cytosine and 85.1% for adenine with longer UV/chlorine treatment (from 2 to 30 min). Thirty minutes of combined UV/chlorine treatment decreased the total organic chlorine produced from cytosine by 34.4% (from 233.8 to 153.3 mu g Cl L-1) but it increased byproduct generation by 683% compared with 24 h of simple chlorination. The TOCl from adenine increased by 50.0% (from 9.2 to 18.4 mu g Cl L-1) but byproduct generation was 11.0% less after 30 min of UV/chlorine pretreatment followed by 24 h of chlorination. The intermediates generated were analyzed in detail and multiple transformation pathways leading to byproduct formation are proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electrolysis and permanganate (PM) oxidation are two commonly used technologies for water treatment. However, they are often handicapped by their slow reaction rates. To improve the removal efficiency of refractory contaminants, we combined electrolysis with PM using an activated carbon fiber (ACF) as cathode (E-ACF-PM) for the first time to treat diclofenac (DCF) in aqueous solution. Up to 90% DCF was removed in 5 min by E-ACF-PM process. In comparison, only 3.95 and 27.35% of DCF was removed by individual electrolysis and PM oxidation at the same time, respectively. Acidic condition was more conducive to DCF removal. Surprisingly, soluble Mn(III) ((aq)) formed on the surface of ACF was demonstrated as the principal oxidizing agent in E-ACF-PM process. Further studies showed that all three components (electrolysis + ACF + PM) were necessary to facilitate the heterogeneous generation of reactive Mn(III) ((aq)). Moreover, SEM images and XPS spectra of ACF before and after treatment revealed that the morphologies and elemental compositions of reacted ACF were nearly unchanged during the E-ACF-PM process. ACF can be remained active and utilized to the rapid degradation of DCF in E-ACF-PM process even after reused for 20 times. Therefore, the E-ACF-PM process may provide a novel and effective alternative on the generation of reactive Mn(III) ((aq)) in situ for water treatment by green electrochemical reactions.

AB Discoloration events in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) are usually considered an aesthetic issue rather than a health concern, and the potential toxicity of the iron-based particles resuspended from deposits in DWDSs has not been a focus. More importantly, it has not been recognized that the iron based particles may have structural transformation under the complex condition in DWDSs which would further increase their adverse effects. In the present study, iron particle-dominated loose deposits, which were collected from a real DWDSs through pipe flushing, were firstly found to possess obvious toxicity to human liver cells. To further evaluate the potential harms of the deposits, FeOOH crystals (which is one of the most representative components in the deposits of DWDSs) were grown with different types of coexisting matters which may emerge in DWDS5. Results showed that the FeOOH had obvious structure transformation with coexisting matters which further influenced their toxicity: the samples with sharp surfaces had higher toxicity than those with smooth surfaces. Interestingly, although the FeOOH particles formed with perfluorooctanoic acid (FeOOH-PFOA) did not have the sharpest surface or smallest particle size among all the samples, they demonstrated the highest toxicity with strong generation of reactive oxygen species. Experimental and theoretical studies verified that PFOA induced the electron migration around Fe in FeOOH-PFOA particles. The FeOOH-PFOA not only was able to capture electrons directly from DNA, but also generated ROS from O-2 using DNA as an electron donor which might greatly enhance the oxidative damage to cells. This study would broaden the understanding of the potential harms of deposits in DWDS5. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the increasing resolution of numerical weather prediction models the slopes of orographic features such as hills and mountains is becoming much better resolved with the consequence that the gradients encountered are becoming ever steeper. The commonly used terrain following coordinate, which actually becomes singular at 90 degrees, is becoming more problematic due to the resulting stiffness making the elliptic boundary value problem difficult to solve. Even when a solution is obtainable the feedback of the pressure correction onto the momentum will generally cause instabilities and/or unphysical solutions. This paper uses an alternative representation of the orography, namely the immersed boundary method, in a semi-implicit-semi-Lagrangian model of the inviscid compressible Euler equations. The results show that the method not only performs well but, due to the chosen method of implementation, that the computational overhead of the geometry can be decoupled from implicit treatment of the vertical gravity wave component.

AB The complex Taylor series expansion method for computing accurate first order derivatives is extended in this work to quaternion, octonion and any order Cayley-Dickson algebra. The advantage of this new approach is that highly accurate multiple first order derivatives can be obtained in a single analysis. Quaternion and octonion-based finite element analysis methods were developed in order to compute up to three (quaternion) and up to seven (octonion) first order derivatives of shape, material properties, and/or loading conditions in a single analysis. The traditional finite element formulation was modified such that each degree-of-freedom was augmented with three or seven additional imaginary nodes. The quaternion and octonion-based methods were integrated within the Abaqus commercial finite element code through a user element subroutine. Numerical examples are presented for thermal conductivity and linear elasticity; however, the methodology is general. The results indicate that the quaternion and octonion-based methods provide derivatives of the same high accuracy as the complex finite element method but are significantly more efficient. A Fortran code to solve a simple seven variable quaternion example is given in the Appendix. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate computation of the electrostatic capacity of three dimensional objects is a fascinating benchmark problem with a long and rich history. In particular, the capacity of the unit cube has widely been studied, and recent advances allow to compute its capacity to more than ten digits of accuracy. However, the accurate computation of the capacity for general three dimensional polyhedra is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on a combination of ZZ-type a posteriori error estimation and effective operator preconditioned boundary integral formulations to easily compute the capacity of complex three dimensional polyhedra to 5 digits and more. While this paper focuses on the capacity as a benchmark problem, it also discusses implementational issues of adaptive boundary element solvers, and we provide codes based on the boundary element package Bempp to make the underlying techniques accessible to a wide range of practical problems.

AB This document presents a new numerical scheme dealing with the Boltzmann transport equation. This scheme is based on the expansion of the angular flux in a truncated spherical harmonics function and the discontinuous finite element method for the spatial variable. The advantage of this scheme lies in the fact that we can deal with unstructured, non-conformal and curved meshes. Indeed, it is possible to deal with distorted regions whose boundary is constituted by edges that can be either line segments or circular arcs or circles. In this document, we detail the derivation of the method for 2D geometries. However, the generalization to 2D extruded geometries is trivial. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A previously developed method, which allows for the estimation of the numerical dissipation through a kinetic energy balance equation averaged over a sub-domain, was applied with success to Navier-Stokes solvers for compressible and incompressible flows. In this work we show that the method can be generalized to other Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and that for the linear advection equation it is in agreement with the modified equation analysis. Novelty of this work is the extension of the original method to the estimation of the dispersive error. The extension is based on a split of the residual of the kinetic energy balance equation that allows for the estimation of both dissipative and dispersive coefficients through a least squares regression. The procedure is validated on the linear advection equation for several numerical schemes for which dispersive and dissipative errors are known. When the new method is applied to linear or non-linear PDEs the estimates of the numerical dissipation obtained using the original method are recovered. The obtained rigorous results further support the previous heuristic method for estimating numerical errors in the course of simulations performed with arbitrary Navier-Stokes solvers.

AB In this paper, we propose an O(N log N) hierarchical random compression method (HRCM) for kernel matrix compressing, which only requires sampling O(N log N) entries of a matrix. The HRCM combines the hierarchical framework of the H-matrix and a randomized sampling technique of column and row spaces for far-field interaction kernel matrix. We show that a uniform column/row sampling of a far-field kernel matrix, thus without the need and associated cost to pre-compute a costly sampling distribution, will give a low-rank compression of such low-rank matrix, independent of the matrix size and only dependent on the separation of the source and target locations. This far-field random compression technique is then implemented at each level of the hierarchical decomposition for general kernel matrices, resulting in an O(N log N) random compression method. Error and complexity analysis for the HRCM are included. Numerical results for electrostatic and low frequency Helmholtz wave kernels have validated the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method in comparison of direct O(N-2) summations.

AB An adaptive cell method is proposed in order to simulate physical fields on a coarse grid with high accuracy. Compared with the conventional cell method, the advance of the proposed adaptive method originates from the so-called node weight correction procedure by using a patch-recovery technique, which corrects the local constitutive relations and in turn mitigates the error source that results from the discretization of constitutive equations. Furthermore, the proposed method has been extended to general curvilinear grids, in which the construction of the local constitutive matrix is derived by using differential geometry. Finally, we have demonstrated by theoretical analysis and numerical results that the proposed strategies can achieve a high-order convergence as well as high-efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Parameter estimation for high-dimensional complex nonlinear turbulent dynamical systems with only partial observations is an important and practical issue. However, most of the existing parameter estimation algorithms are computationally expensive in the presence of a large number of state variables or parameters. In this article, a parameter estimation algorithm is developed for high-dimensional nonlinear turbulent dynamical systems with conditional Gaussian structures. This algorithm exploits the closed analytical form of the conditional statistics to recover the unobserved trajectories in an optimal and deterministic way, which facilitates the calculation of the likelihood function and circumvents the computationally expensive data augmentation approach in sampling the unobserved trajectories as widely used in the literature. Such an efficient method of recovering the unobserved trajectories is then incorporated into a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to estimate parameters in complex dynamical system using only a short period of training data. Next, in light of the dynamical features, two effective strategies are developed and incorporated into the algorithm that facilitates the parameter estimation of many high-dimensional systems. The first strategy involves a judicious block decomposition of the state variables such that the original problem is divided into several subproblems coupled in a specific way that allows an extremely cheap parallel computation for the parameter estimation. The second strategy exploits statistical symmetry for a further reduction of the computational cost when the system is statistically homogeneous. The new parameter estimation algorithm is applied to a two-layer Lorenz 96 model with 80 state variables and 162 parameters and the model mimics the realistic features of atmosphere wave propagations and excitable media. The efficient algorithm results in an accurate estimation of the parameters, which further allows a skillful prediction by the model with estimated parameters. Other simple nonlinear models are also used to illustrate the features of the new algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a novel technique for the imposition of non-linear entropy conservative and entropy stable solid wall boundary conditions for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of an adiabatic wall, or a wall with a prescribed heat entropy flow. The procedure relies on the formalism and mimetic properties of diagonal-norm, summation-by-parts and simultaneous-approximation-term operators, and is a generalization of previous works on discontinuous interface coupling [1] and solid wall boundary conditions [2]. Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate for the entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of boundary conditions are coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable discrete interior operator. The resulting estimate mimics the global entropy estimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data at the wall are weakly imposed using a penalty flux approach and a simultaneous-approximation-term technique for both the conservative variables and the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous spectral collocation operators ( mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators), on high-order unstructured grids, are used for the purpose of demonstrating the robustness and efficacy of the new procedure for weakly enforcing boundary conditions. Numerical simulations confirm the non-linear stability of the proposed technique, with applications to three-dimensional subsonic and supersonic flows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm summation-by-parts spatial operator, including finite element, finite difference, finite volume, discontinuous Galerkin, and flux reconstruction schemes.

AB This paper describes an angular adaptivity algorithm for Boltzmann transport applications which uses P-n and filtered P-n expansions, allowing for different expansion orders across space/energy. Our spatial discretisation is specifically designed to use less memory than competing DG schemes and also gives us direct access to the amount of stabilisation applied at each node. For filtered P-n expansions, we then use our adaptive process in combination with this net amount of stabilisation to compute a spatially dependent filter strength that does not depend on a priori spatial information. This applies heavy filtering only where discontinuities are present, allowing the filtered P-n expansion to retain high-order convergence where possible. Regular and goal-based error metrics are shown and both the adapted P-n and adapted filtered P-n methods show significant reductions in DOFs and runtime. The adapted filtered P-n with our spatially dependent filter shows close to fixed iteration counts and up to high-order is even competitive with P-0 discretisations in problems with heavy advection.

AB To study ion transport in electrolyte solutions, we propose numerical methods for a modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck model with ionic steric effects (SPNP). Positivity preserving schemes based on harmonic-mean approximations are proposed on a non-uniform mesh for the spatial discretization of the SPNP equations. Both explicit and semi-implicit discretization are considered in time. Numerical analysis shows that explicit forward Euler and semi-implicit trapezoidal discretization lead to schemes that maintain fully discrete solution positivity under a constraint on a mesh ratio, while the semi-implicit backward Euler discretization maintain fully discrete solution positivity unconditionally. We further study the condition numbers of the matrix associated with the semi-implicit backward Euler discretization, and establish an upper bound on condition numbers, indicating that the developed discretization based on harmonic-mean approximations effectively solves the issue of the presence of large condition numbers when using the Slotboom-type variables. Further numerical simulations confirm the analysis results on accuracy, positivity, and bounded condition numbers. The proposed schemes are also applied to study practical applications, such as the impact of self and cross steric interactions on ion distribution and rectifying behavior in a slit-shaped nanopore with surface charges. Possible extensions of the numerical methods to other modified PNP models with ion correlations and steric effects are also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The explicit finite-difference scheme is widely used for solving the wave equation; however, its time step is strictly constrained by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability limit. We apply spatial filtering to reduce the high-wavenumber noise caused by using a larger time step beyond the CFL stability limit. We further incorporate the forward and inverse time dispersion transforms to reduce the time-dispersion error. This method allows us to use a time step larger than the maximum time step allowed by the CFL stability limit. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The automated construction of coarse-grained models represents a pivotal component in computer simulation of physical systems and is a key enabler in various analysis and design tasks related to uncertainty quantification. Pertinent methods are severely inhibited by the high-dimension of the parametric input and the limited number of training input/output pairs that can be generated when computationally demanding forward models are considered. Such cases are frequently encountered in the modeling of random heterogeneous media where the scale of the microstructure necessitates the use of high-dimensional random vectors and very fine discretizations of the governing equations. The present paper proposes a probabilistic Machine Learning framework that is capable of operating in the presence of Small Data by exploiting aspects of the physical structure of the problem as well as contextual knowledge. As a result, it can perform comparably well under extrapolative conditions. It unifies the tasks of dimensionality and model-order reduction through an encoder-decoder scheme that simultaneously identifies a sparse set of salient lower-dimensional microstructural features and calibrates an inexpensive, coarse-grained model which is predictive of the output. Information loss is accounted for and quantified in the form of probabilistic predictive estimates. The learning engine is based on Stochastic Variational Inference. We demonstrate how the variational objectives can be used not only to train the coarse-grained model, but also to suggest refinements that lead to improved predictions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of fluid dynamics in digital images of porous materials is challenging due to the cut-off length issue where interstitial voids below the resolution of the imaging instrument cannot be resolved. Such subresolution microporosity can be critical for flow and transport because they could provide important flow pathways. A micro-continuum framework can be used to address this problem, which applies to the entire domain a single momentum equation, i.e., Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes (DBS) equation, that recovers Stokes equation in the resolved void space (i.e., macropores) and Darcy equation in the microporous regions. However, the DBS-based micro-continuum framework is computationally demanding. Here, we develop an efficient multiscale method for the compressible Darcy-Stokes flow arising from the micro-continuum approach. The method decomposes the domain into subdomains that either belong to the macropores or the microporous regions, on which Stokes or Darcy problems are solved locally, only once, to build basis functions. The nonlinearity from compressible flow is accounted for in a local correction problem on each subdomain. A global interface problem is solved to couple the local bases and correction functions to obtain an approximate global multiscale solution, which is in excellent agreement with the reference single-scale solution. The multiscale solution can be improved through an iterative strategy that guarantees convergence to the single-scale solution. The method is computationally efficient and well-suited for parallelization to simulate fluid dynamics in large high-resolution digital images of porous materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB An unstructured overset method capable of performing direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) of many (O(105)) moving bodies, utilizing many computational cores (O(105)), in turbulent, incompressible fluid flow is presented. Unstructured meshes are attached to bodies and placed within a fixed background domain. Body meshes are allowed to arbitrarily overlap and move throughout the domain. Within each mesh a high resolution, unstructured, non-dissipative finite volume method is used to solve for the flow field. Boundary conditions for each mesh are provided by interpolation from flow solutions on overlapping meshes. When many unstructured meshes of different resolution overlap, care is required in the connection between the different flow solutions. An interpolant is created which seeks to preserve volume conservation of flow quantities between meshes regardless of overlapping mesh differences. An implicit fractional step method is used for time advancement, requiring the calculation of a predicted fluid velocity and corrector pressure field. For the predictor step, the resulting interpolation is directly introduced into the implicit equations for the predicted flow field. For the corrected pressure field, the continuity between meshes is weakly enforced using a penalty formulation. The pressure formulation is symmetric, positive-definite and non-singular resulting in a formulation which is readily solvable using traditional iterative matrix inversion techniques. An Arbitrary Euler-Lagrangian (ALE) method coupled to a 6 degrees of freedom rigid body equation system (6-DOF) is used for body motion. For rotation, a quaternion representation is used to solve Euler's equations of rigid body motion. A linear spring damper model, which uses geometry information readily available from the overset assembly process, is used for collisions. Validation of the method for canonical flow fields is presented including assessment of order of accuracy and kinetic energy conservation properties. Particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PR-DNS) of single particles in various flow fields are presented for validation. PR-DNS results of 50,000 spherical particles freely moving within turbulent channel flow are shown as a demonstration of the method at full scale. LES results of a marine propeller under crashback conditions are shown to demonstrate the ability to simulate highly unsteady turbulent flows over complex, moving geometries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Boltzmann equation may contain uncertainties in initial/boundary data or collision kernel. To study the impact of these uncertainties, a stochastic Galerkin (sG) method was proposed in [18] and studied in the kinetic regime. When the system is close to the fluid regime (the Knudsen number is small), the method would become prohibitively expensive due to the stiff collision term. In this work, we develop efficient sG methods for the Boltzmann equation that work for a wide range of Knudsen numbers, and investigate, in particular, their behavior in the fluid regime.

AB In this paper, two local time stepping schemes of order two and three in time are proposed. By construction, they are not mass conservative but a correction stage is added to make them conservative. These schemes are compared with some local time stepping schemes existing in the literature (schemes of Constantinescu and Sandu). The comparisons are carried out on various test cases. They prove that our schemes are efficient and our third order local time stepping has a higher time accuracy than the schemes based on the strategy of Constantinescu and Sandu. Our third order local time stepping scheme is used to perform an industrial-like test case: a 3D Large-Eddy Simulation over an airfoil. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, some stable and efficient numerical methods are developed for two-dimensional Maxwell equations. To avoid solving large scale algebraic equations, we use local one-dimensional (LOD) technique and split the original equations into several LOD equations. Then, the resulted LOD equations are discretized by Wendroff scheme which is usually applied to simulate hyperbolic-type equations. The Lie-Trotter composition and Strang composition are employed. To improve the computational efficiency and the convergent accurate, the space direction is approximated by high order compact method. Some benchmark symbols, such as stability, conservation laws of the schemes are analyzed. Some numerical examples confirm the theoretical analysis. Numerical results show that the new schemes can not only accurately simulate the electromagnetic waves, including profiles, amplitude, but also capture the energy structures exactly.

AB The main aim of this paper is to develop two algorithms based on the Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi (SRJ) method (Yang and Mittal (2014) [7]) for solving problems arising from the finite-difference discretization of elliptic partial differential equations on large grids. These two algorithms are the Alternating Anderson-Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi (AASRJ) method by utilizing Anderson mixing after each SRJ iteration cycle and the Minimal Residual Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi (MRSRJ) method by minimizing residual after each SRJ iteration cycle, respectively. Through numerical experiments, we show that AASRJ is competitive with the optimal version of the SRJ method (Adsuara et al. (2017) [9]) in most problems we considered here, and MRSRJ outperforms SRJ in all cases. The properties of AASRJ and MRSRJ are demonstrated. Both of them are promising strategies for solving large, sparse linear systems while maintaining the simplicity of the Jacobi method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID CONVERGENCE; TRANSFORMATIONS; EXTRAPOLATION
AB We present a unified treatment of the Fourier spectra of spherically symmetric nonlocal diffusion operators. We develop numerical and analytical results for the class of kernels with weak algebraic singularity as the distance between source and target tends to 0. Rapid algorithms are derived for their Fourier spectra with the computation of each eigenvalue independent of all others. The algorithms are trivially parallelizable, capable of leveraging more powerful compute environments, and the accuracy of the eigenvalues is individually controllable. The algorithms include a Maclaurin series and a full divergent asymptotic series valid for any d spatial dimensions. Using Drummond's sequence transformation, we prove linear complexity recurrence relations for degree-graded sequences of numerators and denominators in the rational approximations to the divergent asymptotic series. These relations are important to ensure that the algorithms are efficient, and also increase the numerical stability compared with the conventional algorithm with quadratic complexity.

AB The mathematical description of a new detailed particle model for polydisperse aggregate particles is presented. An aggregate particle is represented as a collection of overlapping spherical primary particles and the model resolves the composition, radius and position coordinates of each individual primary to form a detailed geometrical description of aggregate morphology. Particles transform under inception, coagulation, surface growth, sintering and coalescence processes. The new particle description is used to model the aerosol synthesis of titanium dioxide (TiO2) aggregates from titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) precursor. TiO2 particles are formed through collision-limited inception and growth reactions of Ti(OH)(4) from the gas-phase, produced from the thermal decomposition of TTIP. Coupling between the particle population balance and detailed gas-phase chemistry is achieved by operator splitting. A numerical study is performed by simulating a simple batch reactor test case to investigate the convergence behaviour of key functionals with respect to the maximum number of computational particles and splitting time step. Finally, a lab-scale hot wall reactor is simulated to demonstrate the advantages of a detailed geometrical description. Simulated particle size distributions were in reasonable agreement with experimental data. Further evaluation of the model and a parametric sensitivity study are recommended. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Velocity inside mesh cells is approximated using virtual element projectors on polynomial spaces. For nonlinear equations, we use the Taylor expansion to approximate the normalized solution gradient. We analyze the new schemes for a set of typical level set problems using square and polygonal meshes. The numerical results indicate great potential for using polygonal meshes in applications.

AB Departing from a two-dimensional hyperbolic system that describes the interaction between some activator and inhibitor substances in chemical reactions, we investigate a general form of that model using a finite-difference approach. The model under investigation is a nonlinear system consisting of two coupled partial differential equations with generalized reaction terms. The presence of two-dimensional diffusive terms consisting of fractional operators of the Riesz type is considered here, using spatial differentiation orders in the set (0, 1) boolean OR (1, 2]. We impose initial conditions on a closed and bounded rectangle, and a finite-difference methodology based on the use of fractional centered differences is proposed. Among the most important results of this work, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of the solutions of the numerical method, and establish analytically the second-order consistency of our scheme. Moreover, the discrete energy method is employed to prove the stability and the quadratic convergence of the technique. Some numerical simulations obtained through our method show the presence of Turing patterns and wave instabilities, in agreement with some reports found in the literature on superdiffusive hyperbolic activator-inhibitor systems. We show numerically that the presence of Turing patterns is independent of the size of the spatial domain. As a new application, we show that Turing patterns are also present in subdiffusive scenarios. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The computation of Taylor states in these geometries is a key element for the calculation of stepped pressure stellarator equilibria. The integral representation of the magnetic field in this work is based on the generalized Debye source formulation, and results in a well-conditioned second-kind boundary integral equation. The integral equation solver is based on a spectral discretization of the geometry and unknowns, and the computation of the associated weakly-singular integrals is performed with high-order quadrature based on a partition of unity. The resulting scheme for applying the integral operator is then coupled with an iterative solver and suitable preconditioners. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, and a direct comparison with the leading code in the field is reported. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB We introduce a technique that simplifies the problem of imposing jump conditions on interfaces that are not aligned with a computational grid in the context of the Correction Function Method(CFM). The CFM offers a general framework to solve Poisson's equation in the presence of discontinuities to high order of accuracy, while using a compact discretization stencil. A key concept behind the CFM is enforcing the jump conditions in a least squares sense. This concept requires computing integrals over sections of the interface, which is a challenge in 3-D when only an implicit representation of the interface is available (e.g., the zero contour of a level set function). The technique introduced here is based on a new formulation of the least squares procedure that relies only on integrals over domains that are amenable to simple quadrature after local coordinate transformations. We incorporate this technique into a fourth order accurate implementation of the CFM, and show examples of solutions to Poisson's equation with imposed jump conditions computed in 2-D and 3-D.

AB Multi-fluid plasma models, where an electron fluid is modeled in addition to multiple ion and neutral species as well as the full set of Maxwell's equations, are useful for representing physics beyond the scope of classic MHD. This advantage presents challenges in appropriately dealing with electron dynamics and electromagnetic behavior characterized by the plasma and cyclotron frequencies and the speed of light. For physical systems, such as those near the MHD asymptotic regime, this requirement drastically increases runtimes for explicit time integration even though resolving fast dynamics may not be critical for accuracy. Implicit time integration methods, with efficient solvers, can help to step over fast time-scales that constrain stability, but do not strongly influence accuracy. As an extension, Implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes provide an additional mechanism to choose which dynamics are evolved using an expensive implicit solve or resolved using a fast explicit solve. In this study, in addition to IMEX methods we also consider a physics compatible exact sequence spatial discretization. This combines nodal bases (H-Grad) for fluid dynamics with a set of vector bases (H-Curl and H-Div) for Maxwell's equations. This discretization allows for multi-fluid plasma modeling without violating Gauss' laws for the electric and magnetic fields. This initial study presents a discussion of the major elements of this formulation and focuses on demonstrating accuracy in the linear wave regime and in the MHD limit for both a visco-resistive and a dispersive ideal MHD problem.

AB In a recent paper (Ray and Hesthaven, 2018) [38], we proposed a new type of troubled-cell indicator to detect discontinuities in the numerical solutions of one-dimensional conservation laws. This was achieved by suitably training an artificial neural network on canonical local solution structures for conservation laws. The proposed indicator was independent of problem-dependent parameters, giving it an advantage over existing limiter-based indicators. In the present paper, we extend this approach to train a similar network capable of detecting troubled-cells on two-dimensional unstructured grids. The proposed network has a smaller architecture compared to its one-dimensional predecessor, making it computationally efficient. Several numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the new indicator. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a data-driven Model Order Reduction (MOR) technique, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), applicable to dynamical systems arising from Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) or time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Unlike model-based approaches, the proposed approach is non-intrusive since it just requires a collection of input-output pairs generated through the high-fidelity (HF) ODE or PDE model. We formulate our model reduction problem as a maximum-likelihood problem, in which we look for the model that minimizes, in a class of candidate models, the error on the available input-output pairs. Specifically, we represent candidate models by means of ANNs, which we train to learn the dynamics of the HF model from the training input-output data. We prove that ANN models are able to approximate every time-dependent model described by ODEs with any desired level of accuracy. We test the proposed technique on different problems, including the model reduction of two large-scale models. Two of the HF systems of ODEs here considered stem from the spatial discretization of a parabolic and an hyperbolic PDE respectively, which sheds light on a promising field of application of the proposed technique.

AB A numerical flux function is developed for handling the flow across a porosity interface. The flux function is based on an idealization of the interface between volumes of different porosity as a sudden area change, intervening over a layer of negligible thickness. The evaluation of numerical fluxes at the interface uses any numerical flux function for the Euler equations but applied to sets of variables that keep into account the area change and the conditions on either side of the interface. The new flux function is compared to analytical solutions of the interaction of waves of finite amplitude with an area change. Excellent agreement is shown between the analytical solutions, a standard quasi-one-dimensional solution with an area change over a finite length, and the new flux function. Due to its simplicity, the proposed flux function can be easily introduced into existing multi-dimensional solvers. The new flux function is applied to a transpiration cooling problem and compared to other results in literature. Good agreement with published experimental results is shown. The flux function provides an efficient means of handling the porosity interfaces and obviates the need for any coupling of porous and free flow solvers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We construct a space-time conservation element and solution element (CESE) scheme for solving the compressible Euler equations on moving meshes (CESE-MM) which allow an arbitrary motion for each of the mesh points. The scheme is a direct extension of a purely Eulerian CESE scheme that was previously implemented on hybrid unstructured meshes (Shen et al. (2015) [43]). It adopts a staggered mesh in space and time such that the physical variables are continuous across the interfaces of the adjacent space-time control volumes and, therefore, a Riemann solver is not required to calculate interface fluxes or the node velocities. Moreover, the staggered mesh can significantly alleviate mesh tangles so that the time step can be kept at an acceptable level without using any rezoning operation. The discretization of the integral space-time conservation law is completely based on the physical space-time control volume, thereby satisfying the physical and geometrical conservation laws. Plenty of numerical examples are carried out to validate the accuracy and robustness of the CESE-MM scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose an alternative formulation of conservative fifth order finite difference compact Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes to solve compressible Euler equations. Comparing with the classical conservative finite difference Compact-WENO scheme, its reconstruction procedure is applied to the point values rather than the traditional flux functions, then the HLLC (Harten, Lax and van Leer) and the local Lax-Friedrichs flux functions can be used to compute the interface fluxes in this framework. To maintain positivity of density and pressure, the parametrized positivity satisfying flux limiter is coupled with the proposed scheme for problems with extreme conditions. A number of testing cases including Titarev-Toro problem, the planar Sedov blast-wave problem, Riemann problems, double Mach reflection problem, shock diffraction problem and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problem are presented to demonstrate the high resolution of the proposed compact scheme.

AB Massively parallel nanosensor arrays fabricated with low-cost CMOS technology represent powerful platforms for biosensing in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Internet-of-Health (IoH) era. They can efficiently acquire "big data" sets of dependable calibrated measurements, representing a solid basis for statistical analysis and parameter estimation. In this paper we propose Bayesian estimation methods to extract physical parameters and interpret the statistical variability in the measured outputs of a dense nanocapacitor array biosensor. Firstly, the physical and mathematical models are presented. Then, a simple 1D-symmetry structure is used as a validation test case where the estimated parameters are also known a-priori. Finally, we apply the methodology to the simultaneous extraction of multiple physical and geometrical parameters from measurements on a CMOS pixelated nanocapacitor biosensor platform.

TI Enforcing constraints for interpolation and extrapolation in Generative

AB Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are becoming popular machine learning choices for training generators. At the same time there is a concerted effort in the machine learning community to expand the range of tasks in which learning can be applied as well as to utilize methods from other disciplines to accelerate learning. With this in mind, in the current work we suggest ways to enforce given constraints in the output of a GAN generator both for interpolation and extrapolation (prediction). For the case of dynamical systems, given a time series, we wish to train GAN generators that can be used to predict trajectories starting from a given initial condition. In this setting, the constraints can be in algebraic and/or differential form. Even though we are predominantly interested in the case of extrapolation, we will see that the tasks of interpolation and extrapolation are related. However, they need to be treated differently.
   For the case of interpolation, the incorporation of constraints is built into the training of the GAN. The incorporation of the constraints respects the primary game-theoretic setup of a GAN so it can be combined with existing algorithms. However, it can exacerbate the problem of instability during training that is well-known for GANs. We suggest adding small noise to the constraints as a simple remedy that has performed well in our numerical experiments.
   The case of extrapolation (prediction) is more involved. During training, the GAN generator learns to interpolate a noisy version of the data and we enforce the constraints. This approach has connections with model reduction that we can utilize to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the training. Depending on the form of the constraints, we may enforce them also during prediction through a projection step. We provide examples of linear and nonlinear systems of differential equations to illustrate the various constructions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an improved high-order weighted compact high resolution (WCHR) scheme that extends the idea of weighted compact nonlinear schemes (WCNS's) using nonlinear interpolations in conjunction with compact finite difference schemes for shock-capturing in compressible turbulent flows. The proposed scheme has better resolution property than previous WCNS's. This is achieved by using a compact (or spatially implicit) form instead of the traditional fully explicit form for the nonlinear interpolation. Since compact interpolation schemes tend to have lower dispersion errors compared to explicit interpolation schemes, the proposed scheme has the ability to resolve more fine-scale features while still having the ability to provide sufficiently localized dissipation to capture shocks and discontinuities robustly. Approximate dispersion relation characteristics of this scheme are analyzed to show the superior resolution properties of the scheme compared to other WCNS's of similar orders of accuracy. Conservative and high-order accurate boundary schemes are also proposed for non-periodic problems. Further, a new conservative flux-difference form for compact finite difference schemes is derived and allows for the use of positivity-preserving limiters for improved robustness. Different test cases demonstrate the ability of this scheme to capture discontinuities in a robust and stable manner while also localizing the required numerical dissipation only to regions containing discontinuities and very high wavenumber features and hence preserving smooth flow features better in comparison to WCNS's.

With an internal truncation error of order p >= 1, and a boundary error of order r >= 0, we prove that the convergence rate is: min(p, r+q). The assumptions needed for these results to hold are: i) The continuous problem is linear and well-posed (with a smooth solution). ii) The numerical scheme is consistent, nullspace consistent, nullspace invariant, and energy stable. These assumptions are often satisfied for Summation-By-Parts schemes. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This work presents a data-driven approach to the identification of spatial and temporal truncation errors for linear and nonlinear discretization schemes of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Motivated by the central role of truncation errors, for example in the creation of implicit Large Eddy schemes, we introduce the Sparse Identification of Truncation Errors(SITE) framework to automatically identify the terms of the modified differential equation from simulation data. We build on recent advances in the field of data-driven discovery and control of complex systems and combine it with classical work on modified differential equation analysis of Warming, Hyett, Lerat and Peyret. We augment a sparse regression-rooted approach with appropriate preconditioning routines to aid in the identification of the individual modified differential equation terms. The construction of such a custom algorithm pipeline allows attenuating of multicollinearity effects as well as automatic tuning of the sparse regression hyperparameters using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). As proof of concept, we constrain the analysis to finite difference schemes and leave other numerical schemes open for future inquiry. Test cases include the linear advection equation with a forward-time, backward-space discretization, the Burgers' equation with a MacCormack predictor-corrector scheme and the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a Zabusky and Kruska discretization scheme. Based on variation studies, we derive guidelines for the selection of discretization parameters, preconditioning approaches and sparse regression algorithms. The results showcase highly accurate predictions underlining the promise of SITE for the analysis and optimization of discretization schemes, where analytic derivation of modified differential equations is infeasible.

AB We present a new framework for the efficient simulation of the dynamics of active fluids in complex two- and three-dimensional microfluidic geometries. Focusing on the case of a suspension of microswimmers such as motile bacteria, we adopt a continuum mean-field model based on partial differential equations for the evolution of the concentration, polarization and nematic tensor fields, which are nonlinearly coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid flow driven by internal active stresses. A level set method combined with an adaptive mesh refinement scheme on Quad-/Octree grids is used to capture complex domain shapes while refining the solution near boundaries or in the neighborhood of sharp gradients. A hybrid finite volumes/finite differences method is implemented in which the concentration field is treated using finite volumes to ensure mass conservation, while the polarization and nematic alignment fields are treated using a combination of finite differences and finite volumes for enhanced accuracy. The governing equations for these fields are solved along with the Navier-Stokes equations, which are evolved using an unconditionally stable projection solver. We illustrate the versatility and robustness of our method by analyzing spontaneous active flows in various two-and three-dimensional systems. Our results show excellent agreement with previous models and experiments and pave the way for further developments in active microfluidics. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID IMPLICIT UPWIND METHODS; FINITE-VOLUME SOLUTIONS; QUALITY
AB A higher-order accurate discretization error estimation procedure for finite-volume schemes is presented. Discretization error estimates are computed using the linearized error transport equations (ETE). ETE error estimates are applied as a correction to the primal solution. The ETE are then relinearized about the corrected primal solution, and discretization error estimates are recomputed. This process, referred to as ETE relinearization, is performed in an iterative manner to successively increase the accuracy of discretization error estimates. Under certain conditions, ETE relinearization is shown to correct error estimates, or equivalently the entire primal solution, to higher-order accuracy. In terms of computational cost, ETE relinearization has a competitive advantage over conventional higher-order discretizations when used as a form of defect correction for the primal solution. Furthermore, ETE relinearization is shown to be particularly useful for problems where the error incurred by the linearization of the ETE cannot be neglected. Results are presented for several steady-state inviscid and viscous flow problems using both structured and unstructured meshes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Simulating two-phase flows in realistic industrial-complexity conditions remains an open problem. We present a phase-field method based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation that is able to simulate two-phase flow at high Reynolds number and at large density and viscosity ratios. We employ the entropy-viscosity method (EVM), applied both on the Navier-Stokes equations and phase-field equation, to stabilize the simulation in conjunction with an EVM-based artificial interface compression method (AICM) that maintains the sharpness of the interface. We implement this method based on a hybrid spectral-element/Fourier (SEF) discretization and demonstrate second-order accuracy in time and spectral convergence rate in space for smoothed fabricated solutions. We first test the accuracy and robustness of the stabilized SEF-EVM solver by solving the so-called three-dimensional "LeVeque problem" and compare against other available methods. Subsequently, we simulate a rising air bubble in a water container and find that the method is robust with respect to various parameters of the phase-field formulation. Lastly, we apply the method to simulate the onset and subsequent evolution of an air/oil slug in a long horizontal pipe using realistic parameters and incorporating gravity and surface tension effects. This is a particularly difficult flow to simulate with existing methods in realistic conditions and here we show that the new stabilized phase-field methods yields results in good agreement with the experimental data.

AB We present an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach for the modeling and simulation of immiscible multiphase flow systems. The Naiver-Stokes equations are solved on a traditional Eulerian grid while the fluid mass and phase information is discretized by Lagrangian particles. The method is novel because the particles move with a velocity that enforces consistency between the particle field density and the fluid density. The approach is advantageous in that (i) an arbitrary number of phases are easily represented, (ii) the particles remain well-distributed in space, even near merging and diverging characteristics, (iii) mass conservation is easily controlled, and (iv) the methodology is applicable to a wide range of Courant numbers. The governing equations are derived and a numerical method is presented that is applicable to incompressible flows. Performance is assessed via standard two-dimensional and three-dimensional phase transport tests as a function of both Eulerian grid resolution and Lagrangian particle resolution. Results show that the shape error converges with first-order with respect to increasing either Eulerian grid resolution or particle resolution, while mass conservation errors converge with the square root. The method is shown to successfully simulate expanding elliptical regions, stationary and oscillating droplets, a droplet in shear flow, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the air blast atomization of a droplet.

AB In this paper, we introduce a multigrid block-based preconditioner for solving linear systems arising from a Discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the all-speed Navier-Stokes equations with phase change. The equations are discretized in conservative form with a reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin (rDG) method and integrated with fully-implicit time discretization schemes. To robustly converge the numerically stiff systems, we use the Newton-Krylov framework with a primitive-variable formulation (pressure, velocity, and temperature), which is better conditioned than the conservative-variable form at low-Mach number. In the limit of large acoustic CFL number and viscous Fourier number, there is a strong coupling between the velocity-pressure system and the linear systems become non-diagonally dominant. To effectively solve these ill-conditioned systems, an approximate block factorization preconditioner is developed, which uses the Schur complement to reduce a 3 x 3 block system into a sequence of two 2 x 2 block systems: velocity-pressure, vP, and velocity-temperature, vT. We compare the performance of the vP-vT Schur complement preconditioner to classic preconditioning strategies: monolithic algebraic multigrid (AMG), element-block SOR, and primitive variable block Gauss-Seidel. The performance of the preconditioned solver is investigated in the limit of large CFL and Fourier numbers for low-Mach lid-driven cavity flow, Rayleigh-Benard melt convection, compressible internally heated convection, and 3D laser-induced melt pool flow. Numerical results demonstrate that the vP-vT Schur complement preconditioned solver scales well both algorithmically and in parallel, and is robust for highly ill-conditioned systems, for all tested rDG discretization schemes (up to 4th-order).

AB Poroelastic materials play an important role in biomechanicaland geophysical research. In this paper, we investigate wave propagation in orthotropic poroelastic media by studying the time-domain poroelastic wave equations. Both the low frequency Biot's (LF-Biot) equations and the Biot-Johnson-Koplik-Dashen (Biot-JKD) model are considered. In LF-Biot equations, the dissipation terms are proportional to the relative velocity between the fluid and the solid by a constant. Contrast to this, the dissipation terms in the Biot-JKD model are in the form of time convolution (memory) as a result of the frequency-dependence of fluid-solid interaction at the underlying microscopic scale in the frequency domain. The dynamic tortuosity and permeability described by Darcy's law are two crucial factors in this problem, and highly linked to the viscous force. In the Biot model, the key difficulty is to handle the viscous term when the pore fluid is viscous. In the Biot-JKD model, the convolution operator involves order 1/2 shifted fractional derivatives in the time domain, which is challenging to discretize.
   In this work, a new method of the multipoint Pade (or Rational) approximation for Stieltjes function is applied to approximate the JKD dynamic tortuosity and then an augmented system of Biot-JKD model is obtained, where the kernel of the memory term is replaced by the finite auxiliary variables satisfying a local system of ordinary differential equations. The Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method with the un-splitting method is used to compute the numerical solution, and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the high order accuracy and stability of the method. Compared with the existing approaches for solving the Biot-JKD equations, the augmented system presented here require neither the storage of solution history nor the computation of the flux of the auxiliary variables.

AB The favorable convergence rates of Newton-Krylov-based solution algorithms have increased their popularity for computational fluid dynamics applications. Unfortunately, these methods perform poorly during the initial stages of convergence, particularly for three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. Addressing this problem requires the use of a globalization method such as pseudo-transient continuation, along with an approximate Newton-Krylov startup stage. This class of methods marches the solution in pseudo-time with a matrix-based approximate Jacobian that has a lower bandwidth and better conditioning properties compared with the exact Jacobian. However, this matrix-based approach also has shortcomings, including the large cost of computing and storing the approximate Jacobian and its preconditioner, along with the need for an updated Jacobian for every nonlinear iteration. To rectify these shortcomings, we use approximate residual formulations in a Jacobian-free approximate Newton-Krylov algorithm. With the approximate Jacobian, we compute the vector products by using the approximate residual computations in a matrix-free manner while forming a preconditioner based on the matrix-based approximate Jacobian. This approach keeps the approximate Jacobian up to date and mitigates the cost of forming a matrix-based Jacobian and its preconditioner at each iteration by lagging the preconditioner between nonlinear iterations. We use varying levels of approximations with the matrix-free approach and thereby demonstrate the trade-off between rate of convergence and the cost of each nonlinear iteration. The proposed implementation uses only the exact and approximate residual formulations and can therefore be generalized with minimal additional implementation effort to a range of solvers and discretizations.

AB An adaptive non-intrusive reduced basis (RB) method based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed for parametrized compressible flows. Adaptivity is pursued in the offline stage. The reduced basis by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is constructed iteratively to achieve a specified tolerance. For GPR, active data selection is used at each iteration, with standard deviation as the error indicator. To improve accuracy for shock-dominated flows, a properly designed simplified problem (SP) is considered as input of the regression models in addition to using parameters directly. Furthermore, a surrogate error model is constructed to serve as an efficient error estimator for the GPR models. Several two-and three-dimensional cases are conducted, including the inviscid nozzle flow, the inviscid NACA0012 airfoil flow and the inviscid M6 wing flow. For all the cases, the trained models are able to make efficient predictions with reasonable accuracy in the online stage. The SP-based approach is observed to result in biased sampling towards transonic regions. The regression models are further applied in sensitivity analysis, from which the solution of the two-dimensional cases are shown to be significantly more sensitive to input parameters than the wing flow. This is consistent to the comparison of convergence histories between the parameter-based and the SP-based models. For cases of high sensitivity, the SP-based approach is superior and can help to significantly reduce the number of required snapshots to achieve a prescribed tolerance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as an alternative way of numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) without the need of building elaborate grids, instead, using a straightforward implementation. In particular, in addition to the deep neural network (DNN) for the solution, an auxiliary DNN is considered that represents the residual of the PDE. The residual is then combined with the mismatch in the given data of the solution in order to formulate the loss function. This framework is effective but is lacking uncertainty quantification of the solution due to the inherent randomness in the data or due to the approximation limitations of the DNN architecture. Here, we propose a new method with the objective of endowing the DNN with uncertainty quantification for both sources of uncertainty, i.e., the parametric uncertaintyand the approximation uncertainty. We first account for the parametric uncertainty when the parameter in the differential equation is represented as a stochastic process. Multiple DNNs are designed to learn the modal functions of the arbitrary polynomial chaos(aPC) expansion of its solution by using stochastic data from sparse sensors. We can then make predictions from new sensor measurements very efficiently with the trained DNNs. Moreover, we employ dropoutto quantify the uncertainty of DNNs in approximating the modal functions. We then design an active learningstrategy based on the dropout uncertainty to place new sensors in the domain in order to improve the predictions of DNNs. Several numerical tests are conducted for both the forward and the inverse problems to demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs combined with uncertainty quantification. This NN-aPC new paradigm of physics-informed deep learning with uncertainty quantification can be readily applied to other types of stochastic PDEs in multi-dimensions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB It is an important and challenging issue for the numerical solution of radiative transfer equations to maintain both high order accuracy and positivity. For the two-dimensional radiative transfer equations, Ling et al. give a counterexample (Ling et al. (2018) [13]) showing that unmodulated discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver based either on the P-k or Q(k) polynomial spaces could generate negative cell averages even if the inflow boundary value and the source term are both positive (and, for time dependent problems, also a nonnegative initial condition). Therefore the positivity-preserving frameworks in Zhang and Shu (2010) [28] and Zhang et al. (2012) [29] which are based on the value of cell averages being positive cannot be directly used to obtain a high order conservative positivity-preserving DG scheme for the radiative transfer equations neither on rectangular meshes nor on triangular meshes. In Yuan et al. (2016) [26], when the cell average of DG schemes is negative, a rotational positivity-preserving limiter is constructed which could keep high order accuracy and positivity in the one-dimensional radiative transfer equations with P-k polynomials and could be straightforwardly extended to two-dimensional radiative transfer equations on rectangular meshes with Q(k) polynomials (tensor product polynomials). This paper presents an extension of the idea of the above mentioned one-dimensional rotational positivity-preserving limiter algorithm to two-dimensional high order positivity-preserving DG schemes for solving steady and unsteady radiative transfer equations on triangular meshes with P-k polynomials. The extension of this method is conceptually plausible but highly nontrivial. We first focus on finding a special quadrature rule on a triangle which should satisfy some conditions. The most important one is that the quadrature points can be arranged on several line segments, on which we can use the one-dimensional rotational positivity-preserving limiter. Since the number of the quadrature points is larger than the number of basis functions of P-k polynomial space, we determine a k-th polynomial by a L-2-norm Least Square subject to its cell average being equal to the weighted average of the values on the quadrature points after using the rotational positivity-preserving limiter. Since the weights used here are the quadrature weights which are positive, then the cell average of the modified polynomial is nonnegative. And the final modified polynomial can be obtained by using the two-dimensional scaling positivity-preserving limiter on the triangular element. We theoretically prove that our rotational positivity-preserving limiter on triangular meshes could keep both high order accuracy and positivity. It is relatively simple to implement, and also does not affect convergence to weak solutions. The numerical results validate the high order accuracy and the positivity-preserving properties of our schemes. The advantage of the triangular meshes on handling complex domain is also presented in our numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Extra virgin olive oil (EVO) is among the most counterfeit foodstuffs in the present market. The Italian production is with no doubt one of the most valuable and therefore mostly counterfeit, due to the difficulty in checking the geographic provenance of olives. In order to provide a way for verifying the provenance of EVO, the role of microelements and, in particular, of lanthanides in the oil production chain has been studied. The distribution of lanthanides as determined by means of ICP-MS analysis appeared to provide a good tool for tracing the EVO production chain. Lanthanides and other microelements were then used for distinguishing a particularly prised EVO production from Liguria (northwestern Italy) made from Taggiasca olive variety, verifying that this production can be easily authenticated on the base of these chemical descriptors.

AB This manuscript is a bibliographic review about analyses of different classes of pesticide in fruits using QuEChERS as sample preparation methodology. The aim is to clarify different trends and facilitate decision-making by the scientific community in order to carry out further studies in this field. It is well known that different countries have different pesticides regulations for maximum level of pesticide residue permitted. The comparative analysis amongst the main producer countries reveals that for some fruits they are not studied enough. Recent improvements to QuEChERS make it possible to minimize the pesticides instability due the matrix pH, and achieving cleaner extracts. Regarding the detection systems, the tandem MS are preferred once they have high sensitivity and selectivity, although traditional techniques (GC-ECD and HPLC-DAD) are still commonly used due to their accessibility and good sensitivity to some pesticides. Also, studies involving metabolites usually show that they are more toxic than their precursor compounds.

AB Dioscorea opposita Thunb. cv. Tiegun (DTT), a type of homologous medicinal plant, is commonly used as food in daily life. However, there has always been confusion regarding removal of the peel, as the nutrient metabolite composition of the peel is unclear. Here, a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach was used to determine the metabolite distribution in DTT exclude-peel and peel. Thirteen characteristic metabolites with statistical significance were identified and compared using multivariate, univariate and cluster analyses. The results demonstrated that the peel contained the higher levels of alpha-glucose, batatasin IV, batatasin I, asparagine, beta-glucose, protodioscin, threonine, protogracillin, dioscin, and beta-sitosteryl acetate, and the samples without the peel had the higher levels of leucine, glutamine and alanine. This study provided scientific data for understanding the distribution characteristics of metabolites in DTT samples, promoting reasonable consumption of DTT.

AB Edible films based on gelatin and chitosan have high gas and aroma barrier properties. This study focused on their capability to sorbed/retain aroma compounds (1-hexanal, 2-hexen-1-ol, 1-hexanol, 3-hexanone and phenol) at three relative humidity level (< 2%, 53% or 84% RH). Whatever the relative humidity condition, the order of sorption is keton (3-hexanone) < aldehyde (1-hexanal) < aliphatic alcohols (2-hexen-1-ol and 1-hexanol) < phenol. This order could be related to the intrinsic chemical properties of aroma compounds. The increase in moisture enhanced the sorption at the highest RH for all the aroma compounds. However, a competition between water and aliphatic alcohols is observed at 53% RH. All compounds have an ideal sorption behaviour (logarithmic increase) except 1-hexanal. The sorption of 1-hexanal, 1-hexanol, 2-hexen-1-ol and 3-hexanone induced an antiplasticization of the network by increasing the film Tg by more than 5 degrees C. On the contrary, phenol was an efficient plasticizer at least as high as moisture.

AB The objective of this study was to develop an accurate and fast method to determine malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in raw and processed meat. This method is based on extraction with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and quantification with ultraperformance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector (UPLC-FLD) with lambda(excitation) = 530 nm and lambda(emission) = 550 nm and with a diode array detector (UPLC-DAD) with lambda(absorbance) = 532 nm. The method tested was compared with the TBARS spectrophotometric method with lambda(absorbance) = 532 nm. The concentration of MDA was similar for most of the matrices in both UPLC methods, except for cooked ham and frankfurter sausage. The TBARS spectrophotometric method overestimated the MDA concentration in all the matrices. Therefore, the use of both chromatographic methods, especially UPLC-FLD, to determine MDA would be more advisable than the classic TBARS method to avoid overestimation in meat and processed meat products.

AB Elemental profiles of wines have been used successfully to distinguish their geographical provenience around the world; however, underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, Ba, Ca, Mg, Mn and Sr contents were determined in 215 wines from several West European wine-growing areas using an easy-to-perform analysis based on ICP-OES. Major environmental and wine-making parameters (soil type as "calcareous" or not, rainfall, temperature and wine color) were used to explain variations within the dataset.
   The combined effects of wine-making processes (expressed by wine color) and soil type explained 28.5% of total variance. The effect of climatic conditions explained 24.1% of variance and could be interpreted as intensity of drought stress.
   Finally, carbonate occurrence in soils and climatic conditions systematically influenced the elemental composition of the wines. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying elemental fingerprinting and allow prediction of which wine-growing regions can easily be distinguished based on elemental profiles as a marker of the terroir in viticulture.

AB Bioactive amines are found in food and can be relevant for the assessment of fruits shelf life and nutritional quality. The pulp and peel of 20 banana and plantain were analyzed and the bioactive amine content varied according to the genotype, ripening stage, fruit tissue and thermal processing. In most of the analyzed genotypes, tyramine, histamine, dopamine, serotonin, spermidine, and spermine were decreased during the ripening process in the pulps. By contrast, there was an increase in putrescine level. In many genotypes of plantains, the serotonin and dopamine contents in pulp decreased until stage 5 and increased at stage 7. Peels contain higher levels of serotonin, dopamine, histamine and tyramine than pulps. Additionally, thermal processing affects the content of amines present in fruit. Boiling with the peel should be preferred in domestic preparations, regardless of the genotype used.

AB The determination of cocoa shell content (Theobroma cacao L.) in cocoa products using a metabolomics approach was accomplished via high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS). The developed method was used to separately analyze the polar and non-polar metabolome of the cocoa testa (cocoa shell) and the cocoa cotyledons (cocoa nibs) of cocoa samples from 15 different geographic origins, harvest years, and varieties in positive and negative ion mode. Potential key metabolites were selected which are exclusively contained in the cocoa shell or with significant higher concentration in the cocoa shell than in the cocoa nibs. The pool of potential key metabolites was filtered by established selection criteria, such as temperature stability, fermentations stability, and independence from the geographic origin. Based on these key metabolites an inverse sparse partial least square regression (SPLS) was used for the prediction of the cocoa shell content.

ID COACERVATION SCHEME; ICP-MS; ELEMENTS; SAMPLES; METALS
AB Heavy traces metals may be present in honey being their detection very important for the quality control and it also serves as an indicator of environmental pollution. A new methodology for lead traces determination has been developed based on the quenching effect of the metal on fluorescent emission of 8-hydroxyquinoline and o-phenanthroline at lambda(em) = 360 nm (lambda(exc) = 250 nm). Experimental variables that influence on fluorimetric sensitivity were optimized by uni-variation assays. The calibration graph using zeroth order regression was linear from 0.105 mu g L-1 to 51.8 mu g L-1, with correlation coefficient better than 0.998. Under the optimal conditions, the limits of detection and quantification were of 0.035 mu g L-1 and 0.105 mu g L-1, respectively. The trueness of the methodology was assessed trough parallel samples analysis by ICP-MS. The proposed method showed good sensitivity, adequate selectivity with good tolerance to foreign ions, and was applied to the determination of lead trace amounts in honey from San Luis city (Argentina) with satisfactory results.

AB The chemical and sensory profiles of wines prepared from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes at different ripening stages vary greatly. Here, the soluble cell wall carbohydrate (SCWC) and phenolic profiles of wines were analyzed in parallel with the sensory evaluation of their mouthfeel and taste characteristics. Both SCWCs and phenolic compounds correlated with wine mouthfeel. When analyses were extended to specific classes of cell wall carbohydrates, it was shown that rhamnogalacturonan I/II, arabinan, arabinogalactan types I and II and xyloglucan from grapes were the key determinants of overall mouthfeel descriptors, particularly viscosity, astringency and roughness, whereas heteromannan from grapes was associated with mouth coating and chalkiness. A perceived sour taste was notably associated with higher homogalacturonan contents. This finding provides insights into the contributions of non-phenolic compounds to wine mouthfeel. The data provide opportunities for the development of simple monosaccharide marker assays to monitor major mouthfeel characteristics in red wines.

AB A dietary fibre prepared from sugarcane stalk was compared with psyllium husk and wheat dextrin. In contrast to the other dietary fibres, sugarcane fibre was found to contain significant amounts of insoluble dietary fibre (73-86%), lignin (18.66-20.23%), and rare minerals such as chromium (0.67-2.54 mg/100 g) and manganese (1.07-2.34 mg/100 g). Analysis of the ethanol extract also detected compounds with antioxidant activity. Characterisation of five sugarcane fibres prepared from selected strains, harvest periods (growth or storage phase), and processing conditions showed these factors influenced the final composition. Furthermore, using in vitro digestion, we found that potassium, magnesium, chromium, and zinc in were bioaccessible in sugarcane samples. Also, sodium was shown to bind to the sugarcane fibre potentially indicating bile salt binding activity. Results from this study support the use of sugarcane as a source of dietary fibre in functional foods.

AB This work studies the physicochemical properties of quinoa flour and isolated starch. Starch in the seed forms clusters rich in amylopectin that are immersed in a matrix with spherical and polygonal shapes in the submicron scale. The isolated quinoa starch is rich in Sulphur and Magnesium. The quinoa flour has a higher content of protein, carbohydrates and lipids than isolated starch. Water absorption and water solubilized indexes of starch exhibited high values that could had originated by the extraction method. The broad peaks found for the X-ray patterns of isolated quinoa starch indicate that amylose and amylopectin are composed by nanocrystals, according to the PDF-4+2019 software. The viscosity of isolated starch had a higher value than flour; therefore, the quinoa starch could be used as a thickener in different formulations with the advantage of keeping a significant presence of minerals which are important to the human health.

AB The BRS Violeta grape presents pulp and skin with high content of phenolic compounds (PCs) and intense purplish color. It was used as raw material for the production of juice and dehydrated products using foam mat drying at 60, 70 and 80 degrees C and freeze drying (control). HLPC-DAD-ESI-MSn allowed the evaluation of the quantitative and qualitative changes of the main PCs (anthocyanins, flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (HCAD)) present in the grapes during the processing. The use of the steam extraction method to obtain grape juice allowed a greater extraction of flavonols and, mainly derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids, when compared with anthocyanins. Drying at 70 degrees C was the most suitable for the preservation of the PCs and, at the same time, for the reduction of the processing time. The powdered products presented considerable concentrations of total PCs (3-5 mg/g) and antioxidant activity (32-79 (DPPH) or 17-27 (FRAP) mg/g).

AB Colour removal in raw sugar remains a crucial but expensive process in the sugar industry. In this report, permanganate (MnO4-) oxidation is explored as an alternative method to remove colour-inducing constituents in sugar cane juice/produced raw sugar. Experiments indicated alum, an inexpensive coagulant, was able to remove residual Mn species produced after MnO4- treatment. The optimal dosages of MnO4- and alum for decoloration of a 17 wt% raw sugar solution (70 degrees C) was found to be 4 mM and 2 g/l, respectively. Removal of colour and Mn removal were further improved at ambient temperature. Sucrose, the major component of raw sugar, was not affected during treatment with MnO4- and alum. Two-phase kinetic behaviour for MnO4- oxidation was observed, where an initial rapid oxidation phase is followed by a second slower reaction phase. These results suggest permanganate oxidation is a promising alternative for accomplishing the decoloration of raw sugar solutions.

AB The riboflavin-mediated photo-degradation of methionine in white wine has been related to onset of undesired light-struck taste. This research investigated the effects of different concentrations of riboflavin and methionine, hydrolysable tannins from various sources (nut galls, chestnut and oak woods) and sulfur dioxide on methionine degradation in a model wine exposed to light. Increased methionine concentration resulted in its increased degradation with the consequent formation of volatile sulfur compounds, namely methanethiol, dimethyl disulphide and dimethyl trisulphide. Tannins, especially nut gall tannin, were effective in limiting both methionine degradation and the production of volatile sulfur compounds. Sulfur dioxide enhanced the methionine degradation although the light-struck taste was not perceived when sulfur dioxide concentration was higher than 50 mg/L. In conclusion, the use of hydrolysable tannins can represent a promising tool for protecting white wine against the light-struck taste also limiting the use of sulfur dioxide.

AB In this study, molecular properties of wheat starch from three different types of breads were analyzed using asymmetric flow field-flow (AF4) connected to multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and differential refractive index (dRI) detectors. This analysis allowed the determination of molecular properties, i.e. molar mass (M), root-mean-square radius (r(rms)), apparent density (rho(app)) and conformation. Complementary analyses, such as resistant starch and amylose content, were also performed. The results show that wheat starch extracted from breads can have different properties reflected in changes in M, r(rms) and rho(app). In addition, the results suggest that some of the changes in molecular properties may be related to the presence of resistant starch.

AB Sonication can significantly enhance amino acids (AAs) release to accelerate maturation during short-term and low-salt soy sauce fermentation. Here, sonication was applied at 68 kHz (60 W/L/10 min/8 circles) to determine its effects on the taste during long-term and high-salt soy sauce fermentation. The possible mechanisms were explored by analyzing differences in enzymes profile, proximate indices, molecular weight distribution of peptides, AAs composition and microstructures of sonicated moromis and their controls. Sonication greatly elevated levels of organic taste compounds ranging from 8.4% to 22.2%, but lowered levels of NaCl (6.0%), peptides <= 1 kDa (5.2%), histidine (20.5%) and glutamic acid (3.4%). Compared to its controls, sonicated raw soy sauces also had a more harmonious and palatable taste. Increased enzymes' activities and formation of more surface area and reaction sites in sonicated moromis might be the possible mechanisms for sonication to elevate levels of taste compounds and sensory quality of soy sauce.

AB This work aimed to optimize an aqueous extract rich in phenolic compounds and potential functional properties made of Ilex paraguariensis, Melissa officinalis, and Cymbopogon citratus. The lyophilized extract was used for the development of an ice cream. Total phenolics, FRAP, DPPH, Folin-Ciocalteu's reducing capacity, and total reducing capacity of different combinations of herbal extracts were tested and modeled using response surface methodology. Simultaneous optimisation was employed to maximize the bioactive compounds in the extract and the lyophilized optimum combination was added to ice cream. The lyophilized extract contained quercetin-3-rutinoside, hesperidin, isoquercetin, caffeic acid, and 5,7-dihydroxyflavone. The optimised extract, which showed antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and antioxidant activity using in vitro protocols, increased total phenolics and antioxidant activity in comparison to the control ice cream. The ice cream presented a sensory acceptance index of 83%. After 72 days of storage (-18 degrees C), total phenolics and antioxidant activity significantly decreased.

AB This study aims to investigate the postharvest physiology and texture of garlic cloves packaged in polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), aluminized kraft paper (AKP), single kraft paper (SKP), and mesh bag. Germination rate, electrical conductivity, respiration intensity, water content, and texture were determined during 180 d storage at -2 degrees C. Results showed that the germination of garlic cloves packaged in PET, PE, and AKP was effectively inhibited during storage. PE effectively reduced the degree of damage to the cell membranes of the garlic cloves. PE and SKP significantly inhibited respiratory intensity during storage. Garlic cloves water content did not change significantly in 90 d storage which packaged in PE and SKP. PE exhibited better effect on the texture and freshness of garlic cloves than the other materials. In conclusion, PE is the best packaging material for maintaining the quality attributes and extending the shelf lives of garlic cloves.

AB Hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA) with a padlock probe (PLP) targeting the alpha-amanitin (alpha-AMA) gene, as a screening tool for the universal identification of lethal amanitas, was established in this study. With the isothermal HRCA assay, all of the lethal Amanita species tested from Phalloideae (10) were positive, while the non-Phalloideae Amanita species (15) and three amanitin-containing Lepiota and Galerina species were negative. Furthermore, the PLP based on alpha-AMA sequences from lethal Amanita species was effective for Amanita alpha-AMA, but not Amanita beta-AMA or non-Amanita alpha-AMA. HRCA sensitivity was 100-fold higher than conventional PCR with a detection limit of 100 copies (recombinant plasmid containing alpha-AMA), and 0.2% lethal amanitas could be detected in dry mushroom blends. The HRCA method presented provided a rapid, specific, sensitive and low-cost identification tool for lethal amanitas.

AB The impact of kansui on the dough rheology and quality characteristics of chickpea-wheat composite flour-based noodles was investigated. For noodle dough, both the relative crystallinity and degree of order obtained from X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy increased with the low level of kansui addition (0.5-1.5%), followed by a decreased trend at higher levels of alkali concentration (2.0-3.0%). Such variation was in accordance with the trend observed for G' and G ''. Based on the confocal laser scanning microscopic observation for cooked noodle samples, the low concentration of kansui addition (0.5-1.5%) protected the well-embedded starch granules being disassociate from the gluten network, whereas with the increased alkali addition (2.0-3.0%), the protein network was impaired with a greater amount of ruptured starch granules being disassociated from the gluten network. The observation corresponded well with the electrophoretic profile, and the results of cooking properties, -SH content, and textural properties of cooked noodles.

Cyclodextrins are cyclic glucan oligosaccharides that form inclusion complexes with a number of PPO substrates. This study focuses on the effect of beta-cyclodextrins (beta CyD) on PPO-catalyzed reactions. Potato enzyme extracts and semi-purified potato PPO served as enzyme sources. Substrates included phenolics endogenous to potatoes. Reaction time-courses were followed spectrophotometrically; rates were compared by analysis of variance. Extents of beta CyD inhibition of PPO-catalyzed reactions are shown to be substrate specific and can be quantitatively accounted for based on degrees of beta CyD substrate sequestration. There was no evidence for direct irreversible beta CyD inactivation of potato PPO. An apparent "direct PPO inactivation" by beta CyD is shown to result from a sequence of sequestration-dependent reactions that occur in commonly employed assay systems for the quantification of PPO in fruits and vegetables.

AB The complexation of Lepidium sativum protein hydrolysate (LSPH) with a lipophilic molecule, curcumin (CUR), and its effect on curcumin in vitro bioaccessibility/stability, functional and antioxidant activity were investigated. Fluorescence spectroscopy of the LSPH/CUR complex confirmed the presence of hydrophobic interactions that led to the complex formation. The LSPH (10-30 kDa) fraction showed a compact complexation with curcumin at pH 3.0 with excellent aqueous solubility, stability, and bioaccessibility. Further, complexation enhanced the aqueous solubility of curcumin more than 856-fold. In vitro sequential simulated gastric and intestinal digestion indicated that the bioaccessibility of curcumin was increased from 67% to 95% post complexation. The functional attributes suggest that the LSPH/CUR complex has good foam-forming capacity and emulsion stability, which are crucial for food product formulations. The results indicate that, since LSPH is a dietary protein, it might possibly be formulated as a functional food and as an excellent lipophilic bioactive molecule delivery vehicle in food formulations.

AB Development of an effective sensor for sensing glucose in commercially available "sugar free" food products is important as people are becoming diabetic health conscious. Although multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) possess interesting electrical properties, their hydrophobic nature limits their applications. Their hydrophilicity can be improved through modification. In the present study, Inulin, that was isolated from Allium sativum L. using hot water diffusion and incorporated with titanium dioxide (TiO2), was used for the modification of MWCNTs. The as-synthesized MWCNT-Inulin-TiO2 bio-nanocomposite immobilized with glucose oxidase (GOx) was incorporated into the carbon paste matrix and was utilized for the sensing of glucose in food products. Differential pulse voltammetric studies revealed that the fabricated electrode demonstrated good linear range (1.6 nM to 1 mu M) and was sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of glucose with a very low limit of detection up to 0.82 nM and exhibited a long term stability of 150 days.

AB Scotch Whisky has been analysed as a complex mixture in its raw form using high resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and previously developed water and ethanol suppression techniques. This has allowed for the positive identification of 25 compounds in Scotch Whisky by means of comparison to reference standards, spike-in experiments, and advanced 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Quantification of compounds was hindered by signal overlap, though peak alignment strategies were largely successful. Statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY) yielded information on signals arising from the same compound or compounds of similar origin. Statistical analysis of the spectra was performed using Independent and Principal Components Analysis (ICA, PCA) as well as Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA). Several whisky production parameters were successfully modelled, including blend or malt status, use of peated malt, alcohol strength, generic authentication and maturation wood type, whilst age and geographical origin could not be modelled.

AB Natural red purple dye, Betanin, was extracted from the beetroot, purified by aqueous two- phase extraction and gel permeation column chromatography, and used as a reducing agent for the synthesis of silver-betanin core-shell triangular nanodisks for the first time. Spectroscopic data show that the nanoparticle structure is core@shell like with Ag as core and betanin as shell. Langmuir monolayer model (q(m)= 32.4 mg/g, R-L= 0.99 and R-2= 0.997) was the best fit adsorption isotherm for the dye removal. Adsorption kinetics is well explained by pseudo-second-order equation. Gibbs free energy (Delta G(0)= -2.59 kJ mol(-1)), enthalpy (Delta H-0= 18.05 kJ mol(-1)), and entropy (Delta S-0= 68.92 J/K/mol) were calculated and discussed. The antibacterial activity of betanin-AgNPs were determined against Escherichia coli MTCC-450 (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus MTCC-3160 (S. aureus) bacteria.

AB Infant formula certified reference material (CRM, KRISS CRM 108-02-003) were developed for the analysis of organic nutrients. The CRM is a milk-based infant formula powder, packaged at 14 g per unit. Ten thousand units were prepared and stored at -70 degrees C. For the certification of each nutrient, ten units were analyzed for simultaneous value-assignment and homogeneity test. Analytical methods used were isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (LC/MS) or gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC/MS) as higher-order reference methods. 13 vitamins, 3 fatty acids, and total cholesterol were certified. The between-unit relative standard deviation of measurement results for each nutrient ranged 0.2% to 2.5%, showing very good homogeneity. The expanded relative uncertainties of the certified values ranged from 1% to 8%, indicating that they have higher-order metrological quality. The values of proximates (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, water, and ash) were assigned through inter-laboratory comparisons.

AB The aim of this paper is to test different models for predicting furan content in a dough system, based on partial least squares regression using colour images. Starch dough systems were fried at five temperatures between 150 and 190 degrees C and for 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 min. The furan content was quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, while the corresponding images were simultaneously obtained and processed in order to extract 2914 features. Good furan content predictions were obtained using computer vision image chromatic features using correlation coefficient of prediction (R-p = 0.86). However, the best prediction correlation was obtained using the image textural features (R-p = 0.93), when the number of features was reduced to 10 by algorithms applications. These results suggest that furan content in fried dough systems can be predicted using features of computer vision images.

AB A ultrasensitive chemiluminescence (CL) method for the determination of fluoroquinolones (FQs) in milk was proposed based on the enhancement effect of FQs on the CL reaction between cerium(IV) and methoxylated Cypridina luciferin analogs (MCLA). Prior to the CL determination, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) with superior recognition performances were adopted to the clean-up and extraction of the family of FQs. Then the developed CL system coupling with MIPs (MIP-CL) was applied to the selective determination of FQs in milk. Under the optimized conditions, the method was validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, limits of detection and quantification. The relative standard deviation (RSD) on intra-day assay was below 5.1%, and detection limit was as low as 0.10 nmol/L. The consistency of this method and HPLC method was compared and validated by the paired t-test. The results indicated that the proposed method allowed class-specific determination of FQs in complex matrices.

AB This work aimed to evaluate the efficacy of protein hydrolysates from bighead carp gill in inhibiting protein oxidation and quality loss in surimi. Firstly, antioxidant activity of hydrolysates in vitro was assessed, then 1%, 2% hydrolysates with better antioxidant activity and 4% sucrose were added to surimi respectively and stored at -18 degrees C for 4 months. Peptide sequences of above hydrolysates were also identified. The results suggested that hydrolysates of neutral protease had excellent 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability (42.93%) and Fe2+-chelating activity (73.27%). Compared with surimi without treatments, surimi with hydrolysates had higher sulfhydryl and salt-soluble protein concentrations, greater Ca2+-ATPase activity, lower disulfide bonds, carbonyls and hydrophobicity, as well as better gel strength and texture (p < 0.05). This study demonstrated that gill hydrolysate had antioxidant and dose-dependent cryoprotective effects on surimi that were comparable to the effects of sucrose, representing it as an alternative to sugar cryoprotectants in surimi industry.

AB The effects of ethanol treatment on quality characteristics of cherry tomatoes were investigated over 11 days of storage at room temperature (25 degrees C). Results showed that sensory quality was improved after ethanol treatment, with redder, softer fruits at the edible stage (11 days) compared with control fruit. In addition, the contents of ascorbic acid, sucrose and fructose were elevated after ethanol treatment as well as the concentration of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. Conversely, decreased levels of methyl salicylate (MeSA), guaiacol, (Z)-3-hexenal and (E)-2-hexenal were observed. Selected consumers showed a preference for ethanol-treated cherry tomato fruits compared with controls. Taken together, 0.1% ethanol application has the potential to improve the quality characteristics of cherry tomatoes stored at room temperature.

AB The effects of onion or caraway on changes in the content of biogenic amines were examined in sauerkraut during a fermentation process at 18 degrees C or 31 degrees C for 14 days and subsequent storage at 4 degrees C for 12 weeks. The amines were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with pre-column benzoylation. Total biogenic- amine concentration at the end of the fermentation was lower at 31 degrees C than at 18 degrees C. However, at this lower temperature, the presence of caraway or onion more significantly (than at 31 degrees C) reduced the total biogenic- amine content as compared to the control sample without an additive. After 12 weeks of refrigerated storage, concentrations of phenethylamine, tryptamine, and tyramine in the sauerkraut fermented with caraway (and concentrations of putrescine and tryptamine in the sauerkraut fermented with onion) at 31 degrees C increased as compared to the samples on the last day of fermentation, but did not pose a risk for consumer health.

AB Lipids are only minor wheat flour constituents but play major roles in bread making (BM). Here, the importance of a well-balanced lipid population in BM was studied by applying a lipase from Fusarium oxysporum in the process. Monogalactosyldiacylglycerols and N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines were the most accessible lipase substrates. Hydrolysis thereof into their corresponding lysolipids was largely if not entirely responsible for loaf volume increases upon lipase application. Degradation of endogenously present lipids and enzymatically released lysolipids caused loaf volume to decrease, confirming that an appropriate balance between different types of lipids is crucial in BM. For optimal dough gas cell stability, the level of lipids promoting lamellar mesophases and, thus, liquid condensed monolayers needs to be maximal while maintaining an appropriate balance between lipids promoting hexagonal I phases, non-polar lipids and lipids promoting hexagonal II or cubic phases.

SO FOOD CHEMISTRY

DE Chlorate; Ethephon; Glyphosate; Ion chromatography; Perchlorate; QuPPe
AB A robust and sensitive method utilising a hybrid ion chromatography tandem mass spectrometry system (IC-MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of nine (9) highly polar anionic pesticides (chlorate, ethephon, fosetyl aluminium, glufosinate, glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA, N-acetyl glyphosate, perchlorate and phosphonic acid) in fruit and vegetables is described. Mean recoveries (n=6) at two fortification levels ranged from 83 to 112% with %CVs in the range 3-14%. The linearity range was 0.005-0.4 mg kg(-1) and R-2 values were > 0.99 and the sensitivity of the method allowed (20x or 30x) dilution of samples. Provision of qualitative determination of aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) was also facilitated via minor modification of the chromatographic conditions. Compliance with method validation criteria, survey results from the statutory UK/EU Pesticide Residues in Food 2018 programmes i.e. pea, pineapple, melon and successful z-scores for a UK proficiency testing scheme sample (ethephon in pineapple) demonstrate successful application of this IC-MS/MS method.

AB The effects of co-digestion of red cabbage with carrot, baby spinach and/or cherry tomato on the bioaccessibility of anthocyanins and carotenoids such as a-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein and lycopene were examined using a simulated in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion model. The individual vegetables and their mixtures were digested with and without added a standardised salad dressing. Bioaccessibility of total anthocyanins was enhanced by 10-15% (p < 0.05) when red cabbage was co-digested with the carotenoid-rich vegetables, except with carrot. In contrast, the co-digestion of red cabbage with carrot decreased bioaccessibility of total carotenoids by 21-33% (p < 0.05), and with cherry tomato by 42-56% (p < 0.05). The bioaccessibility of a given carotenoid varied depending on the vegetable matrix. Among the tested vegetable mixtures, red cabbage and baby spinach when co-digested demonstrated that anthocyanins and carotenoids were equally bioaccessible (total anthocyanin bioaccessibility of 62-66% and total carotenoid bioaccessibility of 66%).

AB Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a carcinogenic mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species contaminating maize. At present, fumonisin determination is performed using costly and demanding chromatography techniques or immunoassays. Recently, a molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) - based assay (MINA) has been developed for FB1 detection. Herein, we have applied MINA for the determination of FB1 in naturally contaminated maize samples and results were compared with those obtained with ELISA and a reference HPLC method (AOAC No. 2001.04). The nanoMIPs as a recognition element mimicking antibodies used in ELISA were produced by solid phase synthesis and used in MINA for FB1 determination in 53 maize samples. As a result, 18 maize samples were contaminated with FB1 at levels higher than 0.25 mg/kg. Fumonisin concentrations from samples measured by MINA were well correlated with those using ELISA and HPLC. Therefore, MINA could be used as an alternative technique for FB1 determination in maize.

AB Glycoside hydrolase family 8 (GH8) includes endoglucanases, lichenases, chitosanases and xylanases, which are essential for polysaccharides breakdown. In this work, we studied a thermally stable GH8 from the cellulose synthase complex of Enterobacter sp. R1, for deconstruction of beta-glucans. The biochemical characterization of the recombinant GH8ErCel showed high specificity towards barley beta-glucan and lichenan and lower activity on carboxymethylcellulose and swollen cellulose, yielding different length oligosaccharides. By molecular modeling, six conserved subsites for glucose binding and some possible determinants for its lack of xylanase and chitosanase activity were identified. GH8ErCel was active at a broad range of pH and temperature and presented remarkable stability at 60 degrees C. Additionally, it hydrolyzed beta-glucan from oat and wheat brans mainly to tri- and tetraoligosaccharides. Therefore, GH8ErCel may be a good candidate for enzymatic deconstruction of beta-glucans at high temperature in food and feed industries, including the production of prebiotics and functional foods.

AB The industrial transformation of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) produces processed foods, such as dried tomatoes. In this study two varieties (SaAb and PerBruzzo), grown in three cropping systems (one conventional and two organic ones), were processed by two types of small-scale drying (oven or sun drying), over two years of production. The dried samples were analyzed for their non-volatile and volatile composition, relating the results with sensory analysis. The multivariate analysis performed on collected data allowed a detailed comparison of the effects of processing, year-to year variation and cropping systems. Results indicated that drying methods mainly influenced the composition and flavor profile, also affected by the production year. The cropping system significantly influenced some quality indices, such as the acid and sugar amounts, and the aldehydes, respectively higher and lower in organic samples. The comprehensive PCA analysis allowed discrimination of drying methods and, to a lesser extent, cropping systems.

AB Plantain is a climacteric fruit having economic relevance in several tropical regions. Unripe plantain is an alternative source of indigestible carbohydrates (dietary fibre) and undigestible starch fraction. Unripe plantain flour was explored in this work as an alternative ingredient (whole and pulp) in spaghetti formulations. Chemical composition, cooking quality, texture analysis, and microstructure of spaghetti formulations were analyzed. The microstructure results showed that the presence of fiber in the food matrix helped the reduction of the starch granule swelling in the cooking process. Spaghetti made with whole plantain flour exhibited lower rapidly starch fraction, with increased resistant starch fractions. Overall, the whole unripe plantain flour exhibited good potential for gluten-free spaghetti having highest content of fiber and lower starch digestion rates.

AB This study presents an HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF method for simultaneous quantification of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs, C10-13) and an additional characterization of medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs, C14-17) in oven-baked pastry products (n=38) and unprocessed pastry dough material (n=15). Almost 2 times higher SCCP levels were found in the dough material. Sigma SCCP concentrations in products ranged from 0.3 ng g(-1) to 23.0 ng g(-1) (mean: 6.3 ng g(-1)), while the results for dough ranged from 5.8 ng g(-1) to 22.8 ng g(-1) (mean: 12.9 ng g(-1)). Regardless of the sample matrix, the most abundant CP homologue groups were hepta-and octa-chlorinated undecanes and dodecanes. The average chlorination degree found in dough samples fell within a range of 55-60% (w/w). Meanwhile, a slight decrease of CP chlorination degree was observed for oven-baked products, in particular for C10-C12 SCCPs, thus indicating that thermal decomposition of CPs occurs even under relatively mild conditions.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of ozonation process on the level of oxidative stress markers in raspberries stored at room temperature. Raspberry fruit was ozonated with an ozone concentration of 8-10 ppm for 30 min, every 12 h, for 72 h of storage at room temperature. Research showed that ozonated raspberries were characterized by higher activity of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. In turn, the ability to generate superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide by ozone-treated fruit was significantly lower than in the control sample due to higher activities of ROS detoxification systems.

AB Roasted cotyledons of the Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana) are appreciated as snacks. The aim of our work was to assess the fatty acid, oxylipin and phenolic composition using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to MS and HPLC coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Additionally, various antioxidant activities were assessed. The inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, lipase, cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1/COX-2), and lipoxygenase was determined.
   The main fatty acids were oleic and 7-hexadecenoic acids. Eight phytoprostanes and three phytofurans were identified and quantified. Hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic compounds. Oils showed antioxidant activity determined by EPR, and inhibition of COX-1/COX-2. The statistical analysis showed that the roasting does not affect the composition of the samples. The occurrence of oxylipins in this species is reported for the first time. Chilean hazelnuts can be considered a source of health promoting compounds.

AB The oral breakdown, sensory properties, and volatile release during mastication of white bread were investigated. The results of correlation analysis for white bread's physical properties and it's oral physiological parameters during chewing have elucidated that bread's physical properties determined the oral processing behavior. During chewing of white bread, 15 dominant ions with regularly changing patterns were monitored by proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). These dominant ions derived from 32 volatile compounds were further confirmed by pure standards. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis was used to explore the positive correlations between the sensory analysis and the dominant aroma compounds. Results have shown that 9 aroma compounds were predicted as the potent odorants contributing to the changes in aroma profiles. Finally, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-methyl-1-propanol, and heptanoic acid were confirmed as the key aroma compounds contributing to the changes in aroma profiles of white bread before and after chewing.

AB Vitamin B12 dietary supplement can be critical to the alleviation strategies against micronutrient malnutrition and food insecurity. An HPLC-DAD method has been developed and validated, per AOAC SMPR 2016.017 (Standard Method Performance Requirements), for the quantitation of four bioactive forms of vitamin B12 (adenosylcobalamin, cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin) from dietary ingredients and supplements. The method achieves chromatographic baseline resolution of vitamin B12 forms on a modern column platform without the expensive requirement of an ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography and/or mass spectrometry. The method has a wide analytical range (0.0005% w/w-85% w/w), high precision (reproducibility relative standard deviations ranged from 1.43% to 4.67%), and high accuracy (> 96% spike recovery rate for 11 out of 12 accuracy testing data points). The method detection and quantification limits are less than 0.16 and 0.52 mu g/mL, respectively. To our best knowledge, it is simpler, less time-consuming, and more economical than other published methods for its intended uses.

AB Starch digestibility and polyphenol content were investigated in six (white, red and purple) Thai rice varieties. Total phenolic content (TPC), total anthocyanin content (TAC), amylose content, gelatinization parameters and in vitro digestibility were determined. Purple and red rice varieties were found to have the highest levels of TPC, TAC and amylose content. TAC was not detected in white rice, while purple rice had the highest values. Gelatinization parameters were determined using differential scanning calorimetry. Red rice (Sung Yod) showed the highest gelatinization enthalpy. Non-pigmented rice (Hom Mali) in both purified starch and flour showed the highest starch digestibility, with a total starch digestibility of 76.85% and a digestion rate of 0.25 min(-1). In contrast pigmented rice varieties showed lower starch digestibility. These results suggest that pigmented rice varieties are a source of phenolics and anthocyanin and also a possible good source of low digestible starch to develop as functional food products.

AB In this work, 18 gluten-free flours (prepared from cereals, pseudocereals and legumes), differing in pigmentation, were screened for their phenolic profiles, cooked and, then, subjected to digestion and large intestinal fermentation in vitro. A combined targeted/untargeted metabolomic approach was used to elucidate the microbial biotransformation processes of polyphenols following digestion. This preliminary work demonstrated an increase in 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (on average from 0.67 up to 1.30 mu mol/g dry matter) throughout large intestinal fermentation of pseudocereals (esp. quinoa), due to their high alkylresorcinol contents. Isoflavones were converted into equol-or O-desmethylangolensin-derivatives, whereas anthocyanins were degraded into lower-molecular-weight phenolics (i.e., protocatechuic aldehyde and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, with the latter exhibiting the highest increase over time). A decreasing trend was observed for antioxidant activities (i.e., FRAP and ORAC values) moving from digested to faecal fermented samples. These findings highlight that gluten-free flours are able to deliver bioaccessible polyphenols to the colon.

AB Buriti fruit, with high content in carotenoids and antioxidant compounds, is well appreciated for its organoleptic characteristics. However, its shell, an agroindustrial residue, is mostly discarded. Therefore, to verify the technological potential of the buriti shells, the aim of this this study was to evaluated the antioxidant potential of the extracts from buriti shell obtained by pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with ethanol/water mixtures. PLE optimization was performed by response surface methodology, with all results maximized at the conditions of 71.21 degrees C and with 91.58% of ethanol. The yields values varied from 16.82 to 25.16%, total carotenoids from 23.38 to 1056.59 mu g beta-carotene equivalent g(-1), total phenolic content from 143.37 to 172.02 mg Gallic acid equivalent g-1, DPPH from 31.04 to 48.62 mu g.mL(-1), and ABTS from 1.87 to 2.70 mmol TEAC. g(-1). Therefore, considering the lack of studies about buriti shell, the present work provides valuable results that confirm the PLE relevance to enhance the value of this neglected material.

AB The objective of this study was to develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) with free phytosterols (FP) using conventional fats and oils. Lipid matrices (LMs) and NLCs were produced with high oleic sunflower oil, fully hydrogenated canola (CA) and crambe (CR) oils by high-pressure homogenization (HPH). The NLCs were evaluated for hydrodynamic diameter (Z-ave), polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential (ZP). The melting behavior and polymorphism were investigated for both, the LMs and NLCs. The NLCs presented particle sizes ranging from 148.23 to 342.10 nm, PDI from 0.275 to 0.481, and ZP between -22.27 and -29.70 mV. The NLCs presented higher thermal resistance than that of the LMs. The use of CA and CR separately in the NLC formulations favored the incorporation of FP. The LMs and NLCs presented crystals in beta-form and in mixtures of beta' and beta forms. The developed NLCs can be used for food enrichment, such as spreads, margarine, and beverages.

AB Effect of phlorotannins (PT) treatments on the ployhenoloxidase (PPO) activity and quality changes of Pacific white shrimp during a 16-day period of storage in ice were studied. Among seaweeds, Sargassum tenerimum had the highest amount of PT (10.00 mg phloroglucinol/g), PPO inhibitory activity (71.94%) and therefore selected for PT extraction. The shrimp treated with 5% PT (w/v) showed the least melanosis score, pH, TVB-N values and lipid oxidation among all treatments throughout the iced storage. Lower counts of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria (1-2 log CFU/g) were obtained with 5% PT treatment compared to the control at the last day of storage (P < 0.05). Sensory evaluation proved that 5% PT treatment could cause a 4-days increase in the shelf-life of shrimp compared to the control, PT1% and PT2% treatments. Therefore, 5% phlorotannins from S. tenerimum could be used as a safe melanosis inhibitor for the treatment of shrimp.

AB Typical ketone flavours (with variations in chain length, position and number of keto group, branched chain) were selected to investigate the effect of molecule structure of ketones on their interactions with myofibrillar proteins (MPs). Results showed that 2,3-pentanedione quenched the fluorescence of MPs more effectively than 2-pentanone and 3-pentanone due to the number of keto group. There was no significant difference between 5-methyl-2-hexanone and 2-heptanone, which was attributed to their similar molecular size and polarity. The quenching effect of homologous ketone flavours increased with carbon chain growth due to the higher hydrophobic interaction. Dynamic quenching played a major role in the fluorescence quenching process of MPs by 2-pentanone, 3-pentanone, 5-methyl-2-hexanone, 2-heptanone and 2-octanone. The alpha-helix content decreased gradually with the increase of ketones concentration. Results of GC/MS were in accordance with the fluorescence quenching analysis generally, whereas 2,3-pentanedione and 2-nonanone exhibited some differences due to their higher steric hindrance effects.

AB Thermal processing methods have important effects on food lipids. In this work, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-Q-Extractive Orbitrap mass spectrometry and lipidsearch software were applied to analyze effect of three types of thermal processing methods on the lipidomics profile of tilapia fillets. A total 15 classes of compound lipids (Cer, DG, LPC, LPE, LPG, LPI, LPS, PC, PE, PG, PI, PS, SM, So, TG) were analyzed. In addition, free DHA, EPA, and ARA were also identified. Furthermore, statistical analyses of these lipids were performed based on MetaboAnalyst software. The results demonstrated three types of thermal processing methods had different effects on lipidomics profile differences of tilapia fillets. A total of eight lipid species variables (LPS, LPG, LPI, DG, LPC, TG, LPE, and Cer) and 137 individual lipids variables showed significant differences among raw, steamed, boiled, and roasted tilapia fillets. This work could provide useful information for aquatic product processing and lipidomics.

AB In this study, sacha inchi oil (SIO) (Plukenetia volubilis L.) was microencapsulated via complex coacervation of ovalbumin (OVA) and sodium alginate (AL), and the microcapsule properties were characterized. The omega-3 content in the SIO was evaluated after in vitro gastric simulation and microencapsulation. The coacervate complex between OVA and AL was evaluated based on electrostatic interactions and developed for use as a wall material via the SIO microencapsulation process. The best mass ratio for the biopolymers (OVA:AL) was 4:1 at pH 3.8, and the complex exhibited a thermal resistance at 189.86 degrees C. The SIO microcapsules showed a high encapsulation efficiency of approximately 94.12% in the ratio (OVA:AL) of 1:1. Furthermore, microencapsulated SIO presented resistance under gastric conditions with a low release of acyl (omega-3) units. These results demonstrate that it is possible to use OVA:AL as encapsulating agents to protect bioactive compounds and to improve the thermal behavior of microcapsules.

AB An analytical method involving QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) sample preparation, followed by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS was developed and validated for the determination of 60 pesticides in eggs. Recoveries of 70-120% were achieved for selected pesticides and relative standard deviations < 20% were obtained for most analytes at three concentrations. The limit of quantification was < 10 mu g kg(-1) for 83% of the total pesticides. This method was used to analyze 58 egg samples and the residues of seven pesticides (disulfoton, fipronil sulfone, cyromazine, o,p-DDT, p,p-DDD, p,p-DDT, and permethrin) were quantified in 16 egg samples at levels of 5-10 mu g kg(-1), which was below the corresponding the maximum residue levels, as established by Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. We demonstrated that LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS in combination with QuEChERS can be used to routinely monitor multiple pesticide residues in egg samples.

AB Propolis extract was investigated as potential substitute for sorbate in orangeade. Extract was prepared by using aqueous solution of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrins. Propolis extract was incorporated in non-carbonated orange soft drinks and its antioxidant activity, microbiological stability and color changes were estimated and compared to those of orangeade containing potassium sorbate. L-Ascorbic acid (AsA) degradation at concentrations 0.13 and 1.3% w/w was investigated in the presence of propolis during storage using High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Ion Exclusion Column (HPLC-IEC). The results indicate that the rate of degradation decreased with an increase in ascorbic acid concentration, while addition of propolis affected the degradation rate of samples containing a high AsA concentration. The antifungal effect of propolis extract, potassium sorbate and their combination was assayed. Results showed the inhibition of Aspergillus spp. and B. bruxellensis inhibited in low combined concentrations antimicrobials, while Aspergillus spp. and T. macrosporus were inhibited at 450 mg/g propolis extract.

AB Citral-in-water emulsions were prepared with two different essential oil concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0% (w/w), then spray-dried in the presence of the same amount of maltodextrins (20%). The microcapsules were prepared with two different emulsifier compositions: monolayer microcapsules (ML) stabilized by sodium caseinate alone and layer-by-layer microcapsules (LBL) stabilized by sodium caseinate and pectin. The encapsulation efficiency was higher for LBL microcapsules (e.g. 99.6 +/- 0.4% for 2.5% citral) than that for ML ones (e.g. 78.6 +/- 0.6% for 2.5% citral) which confirm that the additional pectin layer was able to protect citral during the spray-drying process whatever citral concentration. Furthermore, our results showed that the antibacterial activity of the obtained microcapsules significantly depends on both citral concentration and interfacial membrane composition. The presence of two layers surrounding the citral droplets may result in a progressive and controlled release of the encapsulated citral.

AB The effect of microwave irradiation-retrogradation (MIR) treatment on the physicochemical properties and in vitro digestibility of corn starch (A-type crystallinity), potato starch (B-type) and chestnut starch (C-type) were evaluated. After MIR treatment, the amount of resistant starch (RS) increased and rapid digestible starch (RDS) decreased along with the retrogradation time in all three starches. The degree of retrogradation (DR) of starch was significantly positive correlated with amylose and RS content. All three starches subjected to MIR treatment exhibited a B-type crystalline structure. With the increase in retrogradation time, starch granules became more orderly. The DR was significantly positively correlated with relative crystallinity of X-ray pattern, T-o, Delta H of thermal properties, and the Fourier transform infrared ratio of 1047/1022 cm(-1) of starch. The results indicated that MIR treatment is a good industrial method for preparing low digestive starch and retrogradation time is an important parameter for the process.

AB This research investigated the effect of pH on forming electrostatic complexes between lentil protein isolate (LPI) and a range of anionic polysaccharides [carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), gum Arabic (GA), alginate (AL), and tau-carrageenan (CAR)] at 4: 1 LPI-polysaccharide mixing ratio, and their resulting emulsifying abilities. Maximum optical densities were found to be 0.486, 0.716, 0.310, and 0.190 for LPI-CMC, LPI-GA, LPI-AL, and LPI-CAR, respectively indicating the level of aggregate size and growth. LPI-CAR emulsion displayed the highest emulsion stability (ES) because of its higher continuous phase and emulsion viscosities, lower mean droplet sizes, and negatively charged droplets. They also formed much smaller complexes within solution due to their high negative charge. All other LPI-polysaccharide systems formed less stable emulsions than LPI alone due to the larger sizes of both complexes and oil droplets.

AB The aim of the study was to evaluate an elevated (3.0 degrees C) and low (1.0 degrees C) storage temperature combined with dynamic controlled atmosphere monitored by respiratory quotient (DCA-RQ) and chlorophyll fluorescence (DCA-CF) on anaerobic metabolism, physiological storage disorders and overall quality of 'Nicoter' ('Kanzi((R))') apples after 5.5 and 8.0 months of storage plus 7d shelf-life. Fruit stored under DCA-RQ 2.0 accumulated the highest amounts of anaerobic metabolites (acetaldehyde, ethanol and ethyl acetate), regardless of storage temperature and timing of storage outturn evaluation, but it did not result in higher electrolyte leakage. Flesh breakdown, core breakdown and cavity formation were reduced at 3 degrees C. Storage at 3 degrees C combined with DCA maintained higher flesh firmness after 8.0 months storage plus 7d shelf-life. 'Nicoter' apples can be stored at 3 degrees C using a DCA system, based either on CF or on RQ, to save electrical energy.

AB A wash-free and label-free colorimetric biosensor for the amplified detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) has been constructed by the integration of an ingenious hairpin DNA probe with exonuclease III (Exo III)-assisted signal amplification. The presence of the AFB1 activates the continuous cleavage reactions by Exo III toward a hairpin probe, resulting in the autonomous accumulation of numerous free G-quadruplex sequences, which can catalyze the oxidation of 3,3', 5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by H2O2 to produce a colorimetric response. The nakedeye biosensor is ultrasensitive, enabling the visual detection of trace amounts of AFB1 as low as 1 pM without instrumentation. The sensor is robust and can work even when challenged with complex sample matrices such as peanut samples. With the advantages of simple operation, wash-free and label-free format, visible and intuitive output, and low cost, the naked-eye based colorimetric biosensor is expected to have potential applications for in-field detection of AFB1.

AB Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are harmful by-products naturally formed during the heating process of foodstuffs. The present work reported an analytical method for HAAs analysis for the first time in bakery products by QuEChERS technique combined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Bakery products were ultrasonically extracted with acetonitrile and sodium hydroxide solution (1 mmol/L). The obtained extracting solution was nearly dried under nitrogen stream and subsequently purified by QuEChERS technique using primary secondary amine (PSA) as adsorbents. Fourteen HAAs were separated on a C18 column with the mobile phase of a mixture of acetonitrile and 1 mmol/L ammonium acetate water solution (containing 0.04% acetic acid), and detected by MS/MS under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The developed method was validated in terms of linearity, matrix effect, accuracy and precision. The method showed a good linearity (R-2 > 0.999) for all analytes in their corresponding concentration ranges. The method limit of quantifications (LOQs, S/N = 10) of 14 HAAs were in the range of 0.3-4.5 mu g/kg. The average recoveries (n = 6) at 3 spiked levels ranged from 62.8 to 96.8% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 1.2-7.6%. The validated method was applied in HAAs analysis in 20 bakery products and 4 kinds of HAAs (harman, norharman, AaC, PhIP) were detected with the concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 35.6 mu g/kg.

AB We investigated the allergenicity, digestibility and functional properties of whey protein isolate (WPI) after covalent conjugation with chlorogenic acid (CHA). The covalent conjugation of CHA may cause an unfolded protein structure. The WPI-CHA conjugate showed lower IgE binding capacity but higher intestinal digestibility than unmodified WPI. Furthermore, after digestion, the IgE binding capacity of beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactoalbumin was lower in the digested WPI-CHA conjugate than digested WPI. Moreover, the solubility, emulsifying activity, foaming properties and antioxidant capacity of WPI were enhanced by covalent conjugation of CHA. Covalent conjugation with CHA might reduce the allergenicity in vitro of WPI by improving the functional properties of the protein.

AB Edible packaging films play an important role in extending the shelf life of food products. In this work, the properties of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) reinforced hemicelluloses/chitosan-based edible films with xylooligo-saccharides (XOS) have been evaluated. Results showed that the tensile strength (TS) of the film can be increased by 2.5 times with adding 5 wt% CNF. Incorporating 1.79-7.18% XOS into hemicelluloses-chitosan matrix only caused slightly higher water vapor permeability, and the composite films exhibited good hydrophobicity, thermal stability, and high transparency. The hemicelluloses/chitosan films with 1.79-5.38% XOS had higher TS (42.7-50.7 MPa) and lower oxygen permeability (OP, 4.95-5.06 cm(3) mu m/m(2).day.kPa) than those containing 7.18% XOS. Additionally, similar to 92.6% XOS in films can be released in simulated gastric fluid within 60 min. Overall, XOS (1.79-5.38%) with prebiotic properties can be added to films successfully to improve the functionality and the films were fit for food-packaging where high TS and low OP are required.

AB An ultra-high performance supercritical fluid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectrometry (UHPSFC-MS) method for quality control of Piper longum L. has been developed and optimized. Hexane/isopropanol (70/30, v/v) was determined as the final injection solvent and methanol as the organic modifier. A design-of-experimental (DoE) approach was used to optimize column temperature, back-pressure and the gradient slope simultaneously using Trefoil CEL1 column. The back-pressure, temperature, flow rate were set at 130 bar, 32.5 degrees C and 1.0 mL/min, respectively. Positive electrospray ionization was used in the single ion monitoring mode. The 12 analytes were analyzed within 8 min using the optimized conditions. The linearities of the standard calibrations were satisfactory with coefficients of determination (R-2) > 0.995. The recovery measured varied from 96.34% to 105.00% with relative standard deviation (RSD) <= 4.68%. The method was sensitive, reliable and effective, and successfully applied to simultaneous determination of 12 compounds in 28 batches of P. longum.

The aim of this study was to determine and evaluate the bioaccessibility of the PL, PN, and PM forms of vitamin B6 in cereal-based baby foods an in vitro digestive system. In this study, the PL, PN, and PM forms of vitamin B6 were determined using HPLC in 13 cereal-based baby foods. The average bioaccessibility of the PL, PN, and PM forms in gastric pH 1.5 were 53%, 76%, and 50%, respectively. When the gastric pH was 4, the average bioaccessibility of PL, PN, and PM were 38%, 67%, and 36%, respectively. As observed in this study, the bioaccessibility of the PL, PN, and PM forms of vitamin B6 in baby foods is lower in both gastric pHs.

AB In this study, subcritical water extraction (SWE), SWE in aqueous citric acid (pH 5.0) (SWEC), and ultrasound-assisted SWEC (USWEC) were used to extract soluble dietary fiber (SDF) from wheat bran. Results showed that SWE-based methods significantly influenced the physicochemical, functional, and biological properties of the SDF. The fraction SDF-III attained via USWEC had higher SDF yield (46.30%) and carbohydrate content (82.91%), and lower weight-average molecular weight (65.2 kDa) and particle size (1.17 mu m), and looser and more porous surface structure, compared with the SDF-I and SDF-II obtained by SWE and SWEC, respectively. USWEC increased the thermal stability and homogeneity of SDF-III but decreased its apparent viscosity and dynamic viscoelasticity. Moreover, the SDF-III exhibited more significant antioxidant and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities in vitro than SDF-I and SDF-II. Therefore, the USWEC technique had a greater potential for the highly-efficient production of SDF from wheat bran.

AB A scallop midgut gland certified reference material, NMIJ CRM 7520-a, was developed for validation and quality assurance during the inspection of shellfish for diarrhetic shellfish toxins. The candidate material was prepared by using naturally-toxic and nontoxic boiled midgut glands spiked with okadaic acid (OA). The homogeneity and stability of the material were found to be appropriate. For the characterization of OA and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1), nine participants were involved in a co-laboratory study based on the Japanese Official Testing Method, where the compounds were assayed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry following alkaline hydrolysis. The analytical values were obtained by the standard addition method with a standard spiking solution calibrated using the standard-solution certified reference materials OA and DTX1. The certified concentrations with expanded uncertainties (coverage factor k=2, approximate 95% confidence interval) were determined to be (0.205 +/- 0.061) mg/kg for OA and (0.45 +/- 0.11) mg/kg for DTX1.

AB The aim of the present study was to explore the underlying mechanisms involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple, blue, and white barley using quantitative proteomics analysis. We identified the differences in protein expression and related functions involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple, blue, and white barley (named H, M, and L groups, respectively, based on their anthocyanin content) using TMT-liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy-based proteomic methods. Totally, 297, 300, 254, and 1421 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found in H vs. L, H vs. M, L vs. M, and H vs. L vs. M groups, respectively. Six clusters of proteins from the 1421 DEPs were mainly involved in carbon metabolism, amino acid and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and metabolic pathways. Several proteins were validated using parallel reaction monitoring. The proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis, carbon metabolism, metabolic pathways, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were responsible for the color differences in the three barley varieties.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the combination of fatty acid profile and fatty acid delta C-13 fingerprinting to identify the origins of scallops. Fatty acid contents, as well as fatty acid delta C-13 values of 300 samples of three scallop species (Patinopecten yessoensis, Chlamys farreri, and Argopecten irradians) from seven sites in China were determined. Principal component analysis was performed on datasets to evaluate their performance of classification. Moreover, 75 samples were tested by discrimination analysis to estimate the accuracy of origin prediction. The results show that the accuracy rate of fatty acid profile and fatty acid delta C-13 fingerprinting for origin prediction was 92% and 85.3%, respectively. The combination of these two methods improved the identification, with an accuracy rate of 100.0%. These results indicate that the combination of fatty acid profile and fatty acid delta C-13 fingerprinting can be a precise and promising tool for origin traceability of scallops.

AB In this study, comprehensive analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and traditional thermal processing methods (baking and steaming) on cod proteins. Results showed that HHP, but not baking or steaming, was able to increase the content of soluble protein nitrogen (1.42-fold), compared with control. Total peptide contents of HHP-treated samples were also significantly higher than baked and steamed ones. In addition, protein oxidation was greatly increased after baking (1.56-fold) and steaming (1.97-fold), whereas HHP did not exhibit any appreciable effect. Furthermore, the allergenicity of cod was significantly reduced after HHP as reflected by the attenuated IgE and IgG-binding capacities (67-84% relative to control), while baking and steaming resulted in higher allergenicity. This study strongly supports the potential of HHP for reducing allergenicity, avoiding protein oxidation, and improving digestibility of cod and other protein-rich foods susceptible to quality deterioration during thermal processing.

AB Plant extracts from rosemary (RE), green tea (GTE), and mate (ME) were compared for the protection against iron-induced oxidation in porcine homogenates at total phenolic concentrations from 25 to 250 ppm. Lipid oxidation as indicated by TBARS was in all cases sufficiently suppressed, especially for RE. Hydrophobic RE retarded overall oxidation in the homogenates with an inverted dose-dependent response. Optimum delay of oxygen consumption was found at the lowest concentration applied, similar to protection against thiols and formation of protein radicals as measured by ESR, whereas the high concentration increased oxygen consumption and caused additionally thiol loss possibly due to thiol-quinone interactions, generating protein-phenol complexes. Hydrophilic ME or GTE increased the initial oxygen consumption rate as an indication of prooxidant activities at elevated concentrations. However, they were found to protect myoglobin and protein at those high concentrations with GTE being more efficient, possibly due to better chelation effect.

AB In this study, the ultrasonic dishwasher was used to remove five pesticides known to be frequently used on rape and grape. As compared with normal water washing, washing with the ultrasonic dishwasher was demonstrated to be more effective for pesticides removal, achieving removal rates between 14.7% and 59.8% on rape, and between 72.1% and 100% on grape. However, there were significant differences in order of the removal rate of five pesticides on rape and grape. From the adsorption experiments and analysis via Freundlich equation, the adsorption index (n, 0.551-1.056 on rape and 0.362-1.478 on grape) and adsorption coefficient (KF, 10(-2.47)-10(-1.65) and 10(-3.64) -10(-1.56) (mg.dm(-2))/(mg.L-1)(-n) on rape and grape) were obtained. Taken together with the observation of the matrix surface by scanning electron microscopy and the evaluation of the physicochemical properties of pesticides, the different pesticides removal may be related to surface structure of the matrix.

AB Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a highly reactive alpha-dicarbonyl compound that may adversely impact food quality and human health by modifying proteins. The kinetics of the reaction of naringenin with MGO was studied at pH 6-8 and 37 degrees C by UV-Vis spectrophotometry and reaction products were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The apparent second order rate constant (k(2)) increased at pH above the lowest pKa value of naringenin, indicating deprotonated naringenin as the main reactant. A Lederer-Manasse type reaction mechanism is suggested, with dehydration of the MGO-dihydrate as a rate determining step. The quantitative data obtained in the present study was used to simulate the competitive reaction between MGO and nucleophilic amino acid residues (Lys, Arg and Cys) and naringenin in milk. It is predicted that naringenin will be able to efficiently trap MGO during storage of milk, although the reversible trapping of MGO by Cys residues is initially kinetically favourable.

AB We established a novel Dianhong black tea grades discriminant analytic technique based on a fluorescence image along with carbon quantum dots (CDs) as fluorescent probes. Different grades of Dianhong black tea contain different various amounts of tea polyphenols. Tea polyphenols can quench the fluorescent intensity of CDs, resulting in different fluorescent peaks; Dianhong black tea grades can then be discriminated through the use of principal component analysis and Bayesian analysis. Compared with the additional data processing required in other methods, the advantage of our method is that the fluorescence curve can be used directly, and it achieves satisfactory results. We firstly used CDs combined with chemometrics to identify eight grades of Dianhong black tea, and we also provide a new method that improves the identification rate using nanotechnology to avoid performing complex data processing.

AB A method for simultaneous determination of cadmium and iron in cereal flakes using high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry is presented.
   Sample digest is introduced into the graphite furnace together with Pd/Mg(NO3)(2) modifier. The primary absorption line of cadmium and adjacent secondary line of iron are used for the determination. Atomization is performed as a two-step process in order to meet ideal conditions for both elements. Interference produced by molecular absorption of PO molecular bands is suppressed by correction model using least squares background correction.
   Using the proposed method, levels of cadmium and iron were determined in different kinds of cereal flakes, where both elements are of great interest. Working range (0.01-2 mu g L-1 for Cd and 10-500 mu g L-1 for Fe) was suitable for the determination of analytes in samples.
   The method is fast, robust, and may be routinely used routinely in the analysis of foodstuffs.

AB In spite of high efficiency of the iris recognition systems, the accuracy of the system degrades with the increase in the size of database, hence there is need for indexing. One of the important characteristics of such an indexing approach is to have high tolerance against feature deviation due to noise. In this work, an indexing approach has been proposed which deals with the feature deviation due to variation in quality of iris images. Further, an efficient index space has been developed using two set of hash functions. During identification, a set of probable bin location for the queried data is decided depending upon the level of noise in the query image. Such a mechanism will help in carrying out efficient searching of the queried data. Next, the list of candidate data set which are very similar to the query data are retrieved from the probable bin locations. Considering retrieval of iris template up to the fifth rank, the proposed approach gives high hit rate even at low penetration rate when tested with, IITD, CASIA-V3 Interval and UBIRIS 2 iris databases compared to the existing approaches.

AB Maintaining a good balance between convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization is a key challenge for most Pareto dominance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. In most existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, a certain fixed metric is used in the selection operation, no matter how far the solutions are from the Pareto front. Such a selection scheme directly affects the performance of the algorithm, such as its convergence, diversity or computational complexity. In this paper, we use a more structured metric, termed augmented penalty boundary intersection, which acts differently on each of the non-dominated fronts in the selection operation, to balance convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization problems. In diversity maintenance, we apply a distance-based selection scheme to each non-dominated front. The performance of our proposed algorithm is evaluated on a variety of benchmark problems with 3 to 15 objectives and compared with five state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has highly competitive performance on almost all test instances considered. Furthermore, the combination of a special mate selection scheme and a clustering-based selection scheme considerably reduces the computational complexity compared to most state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

AB Credit products are a crucial part of business of banks and other financial institutions. A novel approach based on time series of customer's data representation for predicting willingness to take a personal loan is shown. Proposed testing procedure based on moving window allows detection of complex, sequential, time based dependencies between particular transactions. Moreover, this approach reduces noise by eliminating irrelevant dependencies that would occur due to the lack of time dimension analysis.
   The system for identifying customers interested in credit products, based on classification with random forests and deep neural networks is proposed. The promising results of empirical studies prove that the system is able to extract significant patterns from customers historical transfer and transactional data and predict credit purchase likelihood. Our approach, including the testing method, is not limited to banking sector and can be easily transferred and implemented as a general purpose direct marketing campaign system.

AB In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels. This method plays a significant role in observing many eye diseases. A strided-CNN model is proposed for accurate segmentation of retinal vessels, especially the tiny vessels. The model is a fully convolutional model consisting of an encoder part and a decoder part where the pooling layers are replaced with strided convolutional layers. The strided convolutional layer approach was chosen over the pooling layers approach as the former can be trained. The morphological mappings along with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)- based pre-processing steps are used to generate contrast images for training dataset. Skip connections are implemented to concatenate features from the encoder part and the decoder part to enhance the vessels segmentation especially the tiny vessels and to make the vessel's edges sharper. We used a class balancing loss function to train and optimize the proposed model to improve vessel image quality. The impact of the proposed segmentation method is evaluated on four databases namely DRIVE, STARE, CHASE-DB1 and HRF. Overall model performance, particularly with respect to tiny vessels, is primarily influenced by sensitivity and accuracy metrics. We demonstrate that our model outperforms other models with a sensitivity of 0.87, 0.808, 0.886 and 0.829 on DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DBI and HRF respectively, along with respective accuracies of 0.956, 0.954, 0.976 and 0.962.

AB The task of Speaker LOCalization (SLOC) has been the focus of numerous works in the research field, where SLOC is performed on pure speech data, requiring the presence of an Oracle Voice Activity Detection (VAD) algorithm. Nevertheless, this perfect working condition is not satisfied in a real world scenario, where employed VADs do commit errors. This work addresses this issue with an extensive analysis focusing on the relationship between several data-driven VAD and SLOC models, finally proposing a reliable framework for VAD and SLOC. The effectiveness of the approach here discussed is assessed against a multi-room scenario, which is close to a real-world environment. Furthermore, up to the authors' best knowledge, only one contribution proposes a unique framework for VAD and SLOC acting in this addressed scenario; however, this solution does not rely on data-driven approaches.
   This work comes as an extension of the authors' previous research addressing the VAD and SLOC tasks, by proposing numerous advancements to the original neural network architectures. In details, four different models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are here tested, in order to easily high-light the advantages of the introduced novelties. In addition, two different CNN models go under study for SLOC. Furthermore, training of data-driven models is here improved through a specific data augmentation technique. During this procedure, the room impulse responses (RIRs) of two virtual rooms are generated from the knowledge of the room size, reverberation time and microphones and sources placement. Finally, the only other framework for simultaneous detection and localization in a multi-room scenario is here taken into account to fairly compare the proposed method.
   As result, the proposed method is more accurate than the baseline framework, and remarkable improvements are specially observed when the data augmentation techniques are applied for both the VAD and SLOC tasks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A capacitive electrocardiogram (cECG) signal is considered a promising alternative to a conventional contact electrocardiogram (ECG) signal because the cECG signal can serve the same purpose as the contact ECG signal but can be measured during daily life without causing a subject to feel uncomfortable. However, the cECG signal has a limitation in that detection of QRS complexes, which is a fundamental step to analyze heart condition, is not easy. That is because the cECG signal is sensitive to noise, especially motion noise. This paper proposes a method to detect QRS complexes in cECG signals degraded by motion noise. The proposed method is based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and mainly consists of three parts: the generation of ground-truth data, the FCN model, and postprocessing. A labeling process for generating the ground-truth data is proposed. Then, an FCN model that is suitable for cECG signals is proposed. The proposed FCN model uses filters of a large size to achieve a large receptive field, unlike the common FCN models used in image processing. The receptive field is sufficiently large to involve information about adjacent QRS complexes, such as the time interval between the QRS complexes and its variability. By considering the information, the proposed FCN model can reliably classify QRS complexes even in cECG signals degraded by motion noise. Additionally, postprocessing, which consists of an accumulation step and a non-maximum suppression step, is proposed to complement the proposed FCN model. In experiments with real data, the proposed method showed an average sensitivity of 96.94%, positive predictive value of 99.13%, and F1 score of 98.02%. These results demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes the limitation of a cECG signal and helps the cECG signal be widely utilized for medical or healthcare applications.

AB In the research of expert and intelligent systems on three-dimensional (3-D) brain magnetic resonance (MR) images, segmentation is the fundamental step of quantitative analysis of brain tissues. Due to the influence of various factors on brain MR images, segmentation is challenging. The Markov random field (MRF) model is promising for segmentation given some recent encouraging results. However, the traditional MRF model usually relies on a single feature. In this paper, we first propose a novel Markov multiple feature random fields (MMFRF) model, which is able to combine various types of features into a unified decision model using the Bayesian framework. Second, we mainly focus our research on two feature random fields in the MMFRF model for the segmentation of brain MR images. The intensity feature random field and the texture feature random field are combined into a unified framework to model the image. In particular, we use patch-based 3-D texture features through gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) statistics to construct the texture feature random field. The performance of our proposed method is compared with some state-of-the-art approaches on both real and simulated brain MR datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is superior to the competing approaches. In theory, the traditional MRF model can be treated as a special case of the proposed general MMFRF model where only one feature random field is considered. Furthermore, the results also show the feasibility of employing the proposed method, which provides accurate and efficient brain tissue segmentation, to develop effective expert and intelligent systems for brain MR images.

DE Random forest; Variable selection; Feature reduction; Classification
AB Random forest classification is a popular machine learning method for developing prediction models in many research settings. Often in prediction modeling, a goal is to reduce the number of variables needed to obtain a prediction in order to reduce the burden of data collection and improve efficiency. Several variable selection methods exist for the setting of random forest classification; however, there is a paucity of literature to guide users as to which method may be preferable for different types of datasets. Using 311 classification datasets freely available online, we evaluate the prediction error rates, number of variables, computation times and area under the receiver operating curve for many random forest variable selection methods. We compare random forest variable selection methods for different types of datasets (datasets with binary outcomes, datasets with many predictors, and datasets with imbalanced outcomes) and for different types of methods (standard random forest versus conditional random forest methods and test based versus performance based methods). Based on our study, the best variable selection methods for most datasets are Jiang's method and the method implemented in the VSURF R package. For datasets with many predictors, the methods implemented in the R packages varSelRF and Boruta are preferable due to computational efficiency. A significant contribution of this study is the ability to assess different variable selection techniques in the setting of random forest classification in order to identify preferable methods based on applications in expert and intelligent systems.

AB Classification based on image set is recently a competitive technique, where each set contains multiple images of a person or an object. As a widely used model, affine hull has shown its power in modeling image set. However, due to the existence of noise and outliers, the over-large affine hull usually matches fails when two hulls overlapped. Aiming at alleviating this handicap, this paper proposes a novel method for image set classification, namely Learning of Reduced Prototypes and Local Metric (LRPLM). Specifically, for each gallery image set, a reduced set of prototypes and an optimal local feature-wise metric are simultaneously learned, which jointly minimize the loss function involved the estimation of classification error probability. In doing so, LRPLM inherits the merits of affine hull with better representation to account for the unseen appearances and makes use of the powerful discriminative ability improved by the local metric. It looks like that LRPLM pulls similar image sets with the same class label "closer" to each other, while pushing dissimilar ones "far away". Extensive experiments illustrate the considerable effectiveness of LRPLM on three widely used datasets. As we know, classification is a research hotspot in expert and intelligent systems. Different from the previous classification methods, LRPLM focuses on image set-based classification technology, while most of them are single-shot classification technology. Thus, the proposed method can be considered as an expert system technology for medical diagnosis, security monitoring, object categorization, and biometrics recognition applications.

AB The World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported that the lung tumor was the leading cause of death worldwide. In this study, a practical computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is developed to increase a patient's chance of survival. Segmentation is acritical analysis tool for dividing a lung image into several sub-regions. This work characterized an automated 3-D lung segmentation tool modeled by an active contour model for computed tomography (CT) images. The proposed segmentation model is used to integrate the local image bias field formulation with the active contour model (ACM). Here, a local energy term is specified by using the mean squared error to reconcile severely in homogeneous CT images and used to detect and segment tumor regions efficiently with intensity inhomogeneity. In addition, a Multiscale Gaussian distribution was applied to the CT images for smoothening the evolution process, and features were determined. For proposed model evaluation, were used the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC-IDRI) data set that consisted of 850 lung nodule-lesion images that were segmented and refined to generate accurate 3D lesions of lung tumor CT images. Tumor portions were extracted with 97% accuracy. Using continuous feature extraction of 3-D images leads to attributing the deformation and quantifies the centroid displacement. In this work, predict the centroid displacement and contour points by a curve evolution method which results in more accurate predictions of contour changes and than the extracted images were classified using an Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Classifier. The experimental result shows that the modified Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system has a high ability to acquire good accuracy and assures automated diagnosis of a lung tumor.

AB One important and challenging issue in handwritten character recognition is the discrimination of visually similar characters. In this paper, we propose a character recognition method for distinguishing similar characters by augmenting commonly used image feature with gradient features from potentially discriminative image regions. The discriminative regions of similar characters sets are automatically detected by analysing the weight vectors of the sparsity promoting logistic fused Lasso method. The histogram of oriented gradients is adopted to compactly represent the gradient features. Additionally, the locality preserving projection method is employed to alleviate the high dimensional nature of the resulting feature vectors. Experimental results on handwritten Lanna Dhamma and Thai characters datasets demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in discriminating visually similar characters. The method also outperforms existing character recognition methods by considerable margins. It has a great potential for character recognition of other alphabets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Facial sketches are widely used by law enforcement agencies to assist in the identification and apprehension of suspects involved in criminal activities. Sketches used in forensic investigations are drawn by forensic artists following the verbal description provided by an eyewitness or the victim. In a forensic sketch, the facial description depends on the memory of the eyewitness, therefore, there is uncertainty in facial attributes. Most of the existing sketch-photo retrieval methods have ignored the uncertainty of facial attributes. In this paper, we have proposed a novel multimodal framework for sketch-photo retrieval. We have fused the facial attributes and the semantic color information using a fuzzy rule based layered classifier. We have also performed a survey to rank the importance of different facial attributes in the identification of a person. We have performed experiments using viewed, semi-forensic and forensic sketches dataset and results are compared with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy rule based method achieves promising performance as compared to state-of-art methods specifically in case of forensic sketches.

AB Recent advances in technology bring about novel operating environments where the role of human participants is reduced to passive observation. While opening new frontiers in productivity and lifestyle, such environments also create hazards related to the inability of human individuals to maintain focus and concentration during passive control tasks. A passive brain-computer interface for monitoring mental attention states of human individuals (focused, unfocused, and drowsy) by using electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity imaging and machine learning data analysis methods is developed in this work. An EEG data processing pipeline and a machine learning mental state detection algorithm using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method were designed and compared with k-Nearest Neighbor and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System methods. To collect 25 h of EEG data from 5 participants, a classic EEG headset was modified. We found that the changes in EEG activity in frontal and parietal lobes occurring at 1-5 Hz and 10-15 Hz frequency bands were associated with the changes in individuals' attention state. We demonstrated the ability to use such changes to identify individuals' attention state with 96.70% (best) and 91.72% (avg.) accuracy in experimental settings using a version of continuous performance task with SVM-based mental state detector. The findings help guide the design of future systems for monitoring the state of human individuals by means of EEG brain activity data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Automatic methods are needed to efficiently sieve and scavenge useful information from the Internet. Text summarization is identified and accepted as one of the solutions to find desired contents from one or more documents. The objective of proposed multi-document summarization is to gain good content coverage with information diversity. The proposed statistical feature based model utilizes the fuzzy model to deal with the imprecise and uncertainty of feature weight. Redundancy removal using cosine similarity is presented as enrichment to proposed work. The proposed approach is compared with DUC (Document Understanding Conference) participant systems and other summarization systems such as TexLexAn, ItemSum, Yago Summarizer, MSSF and PatSum using ROUGE measure on dataset DUC 2004.

AB Increase in complexity of real world problems has provided an area to explore efficient methods to solve computer science problems. Meta-heuristic methods based on evolutionary computations and swarm intelligence are instances of techniques inspired by nature. This paper presents a novel social mimic optimization (SMO) algorithm inspired by mimicking behavior to solve optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using 23 test functions. Obtained results are compared with 14 known optimization algorithms including Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), Grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Stochastic fractal search (SFS), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Optics Inspired Optimization (OIO), League Championship Algorithm (LCA), Wind Driven Optimization (WDO), Harmony search (HS), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO), Bat Algorithm (BA), and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO). Obtained results indicate higher capability of the SMO algorithm in solving high-dimensional decision variables. Furthermore, SMO is used to solve two classic engineering design problems. Three important features of SMO are simple implementation, solving optimization problems with minimum population size and not requiring control parameters. Results of various evaluations show superiority of the proposed method in finding the optimal solution with minimum function evaluations. This superiority is achieved based on reducing number of initial population. The proposed method can be applied to applications like automatic evolution of robotics, automatic control of machines and innovation of machines in finding better solutions with less cost.

AB Document clustering is a gathering of textual content documents into groups or clusters. The main aim is to cluster the documents, which are internally logical but considerably different from each other. It is a crucial process used in information retrieval, information extraction and document organization. In recent years, the spectral clustering is widely applied in the field of machine learning as an innovative clustering technique. This research work proposes a novel Spectral Clustering algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization (SCPSO) to improve the text document clustering. By considering global and local optimization function, the randomization is carried out with the initial population. This research work aims at combining the spectral clustering with swarm optimization to deal with the huge volume of text documents. The proposed algorithm SCPSO is examined with the benchmark database against the other existing approaches. The proposed algorithm SCPSO is compared with the Spherical K-means, Expectation Maximization Method (EM) and standard PSO Algorithm. The concluding results show that the proposed SCPSO algorithm yields better clustering accuracy than other clustering techniques. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study the problem of representation learning in heterogeneous information networks. Its unique challenges come from the existence of multiple types of vertices and edges. Existing proximity-based network embedding techniques ignore the type information when evaluating the proximity and limits their usage in heterogeneous scenario. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous proximity preserving network embedding model via meta path guided random walk, which is capable of capturing the high-order proximity between vertices specified by the given path. To improve the learning efficiency, we introduce a sampling based learning strategy which can incrementally learn representations. We conduct experiments on two real world heterogeneous information networks. Experimental results on several mining tasks prove the effectiveness of our approach over many competitive baselines. The model is very efficient and is able to learn embeddings for large networks both in offline and online scenarios. Besides, for expert system, our approach can be applied to improve the representation of knowledge entities by depicting the knowledge base as a heterogeneous information network.

AB This paper proposes a two-stage scoring approach to help lenders decide their fund allocations in peerto-peer (P2P) lending market. The existing scoring approaches focus on only either probability of default (PD) prediction, known as credit scoring, or profitability prediction, known as profit scoring, to identify the best loans for investment. Credit scoring fails to deliver the main need of lenders on how much profit they may obtain through their investment. On the other hand, profit scoring can satisfy that need by predicting the investment profitability. However, profit scoring is not free from the imbalance problem where most of the past loans are non-default. Consequently, ignorance of the imbalance problem significantly affects the accuracy of profitability prediction. Our proposed two-stage scoring approach is an integration of credit scoring and profit scoring to address the above challenges. More specifically, stage 1 is designed to identify non-default loans while the imbalanced nature of loan status is considered in PD prediction. The loans identified as non-default are then moved to stage 2 for prediction of profitability, measured by internal rate of return. Wide and deep learning is used to build the predictive models in both stages to achieve both memorization and generalization. Extensive numerical studies are conducted based on real-world data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The numerical studies indicate our two-stage scoring approach outperforms the existing credit scoring and profit scoring approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) which is a single layer feedforward neural network provides extremely fast training speed and good generalization performance. The ELM however, has its respective drawback: it is known to be sensitive to the ill-conditioned data. To overcome the ill-conditioning problem in ELM, ELM based on ridge regression (RR-ELM) was proposed. Since RR-ELM is a biased method, ELM based on almost unbiased ridge regression (AUR-ELM) was accordingly proposed to reduce the bias in a certain extent. RR-ELM and AUR-ELM introduced in the existence of multicollinearity, depend on the regularization parameter. The regularization parameter affects the performance of both RR-ELM and AUR-ELM. There is no consensus on the selection of the regularization parameter. Although there are various methods in linear regression to select the regularization parameter, only one method based on the selection minimizing the mean squared error was used in RR-ELM. In this study, AIC, BIC and CV criteria in the context of RR-ELM and AUR-ELM were proposed as alternative methods for the selection of the regularization parameter. An experimental study was conducted on eight data sets which are widely known and used in machine learning studies. The analyzes are considered as purposive for regression studies which are the most important fields of expert systems and machine learning. The results obtained demonstrate that the selection method of the regularization parameter is significantly effective on both the generalization and particularly stability performance of RR-ELM and AUR-ELM when compared to ELM (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bayesian Networks (BNs) are effective tools for providing decision support based on expert knowledge in uncertain and complex environments. However, building knowledge-based BNs is still a difficult task that lacks systematic and widely accepted methodologies, especially when knowledge is elicited from multiple experts. We propose a novel method that systematically integrates a widely used Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach called Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) in BN construction. Our method elicits causal knowledge from multiple experts based on DEMATEL and transforms it to a BN structure. It then parameterizes the BN by using ranked nodes and evaluates its robustness and consistency by using sensitivity analysis. The proposed method provides a practical and generic way to build probabilistic decision support models by systematically exploiting expert knowledge. Suitable applications of this method include decision problems with multiple criteria, high uncertainty and limited data. We illustrate our method by applying it to a supplier selection case study in a large automobile manufacturer in Turkey. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diffusion is an important phenomenon in different sciences like epidemiology, economy, biology and social sciences. Information diffusion is mainly important for two reasons, to study and forecast diffusion growth and to find the source of information and validate information clarity. Researchers study diffusion in social networks and observe different aspects of them which affect diffusion properties but, diffusion type of information diffusion is not studied before. Diffusion type is normal or anomalous which have different properties and should be modeled differently, for example, random walk in one-dimensional lattice is normal diffusion but what about random walk on networks? In this paper diffusion type of discrete time random walk (DTRW) and continuous time random walk (CTRW) over 1D lattice and simple graph are studied also, diffusion type of two social networks namely Twitter and Digg are studied. Anomalous diffusion is important since most of the systems in nature have normal diffusion and there are a few numbers of systems with anomalous diffusion. To the best of our knowledge this the first time where diffusion type of information diffusion in social networks is addressed. Our results show that information diffusion in both of the Digg and Twitter is anomalous and to be more specific it is subdiffusion but, by looking more deeply, diffusion type is superdiffusion in early hours after starting diffusion in some diffusions. Some strategies are introduced to make anomalous diffusions closer to normal diffusion, which is important for policy makers of health and marketing agencies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Computer vision-guided traffic management is an emerging area of research. Intelligent traffic signal control using computer vision is a less explored area of research. In this paper, we propose a new approach of traffic flow-based intelligent signal timing by temporally clustering optical flow features of moving vehicles using Temporal Unknown Incremental Clustering (TUIC) model. First, we propose a new inference scheme that works approximately 5-times faster as compared to the one originally proposed in TUIC in a dense traffic intersection. The new inference scheme can trace clusters representing moving objects that may be occluded while being tracked. Cluster counts of approach roads have been used for signal timing for traffic intersections. It is done by detecting cluster motion inside the regions-of-interest (ROI) marked at the entry and exit locations of intersection approaches. Departure rates are learned using Gaussian regression to parameterize traffic variations. Using the learned parameters as a function of cluster count, an adaptive signal timing algorithm, namely Throughput and Average Waiting Time Optimization (TAWTO) has been proposed. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can achieve better average waiting time and throughput as compared to the state-of-the-art signal timing algorithms. We intend to publish two datasets as part of this work for enabling the research community to explore computer vision aided solutions for typical problems such as intelligent traffic controlling, violation detection in chaotic road intersections, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The electric travelling salesman problem with time windows (ETSPTW) is an extension of the well-known travelling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW). The ETSPTW additionally considers recharging operations of the electric vehicle at identical charging stations. However, different charging technologies used at public or private stations result in different charging times of the electric vehicles. Therefore, this study extends the ETSPTW by additionally considering charging operations at customer locations with different charging rates, called hereafter the electric travelling salesman problem with time windows and mixed charging rates (ETSPTW-MCR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that considers both private and public charging stations for the ETSPTW. In addition to the extended version of the ETSPTW, this paper introduces a new and effective hybrid Simulated Annealing/Tabu Search (SA/TS) algorithm to solve the ETSPTW-MCR problem efficiently. Distinct from the existing hybridization of SA and TS, the proposed hybrid SA/TS algorithm employs efficient search procedures based on the TSPTW restrictions, a modified solution acceptance criterion, and an advanced tabu list structure. Moreover, an improved dynamic programming procedure is integrated to optimally find the charging station visits in shorter computational times. The proposed hybrid SA/TS is tested on several TSPTW and ETSPTW benchmark problems and compared with well-known solution approaches. Results of these experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other considered competitor algorithms both with regard to solution quality and computational time. Furthermore, 26 new best results are obtained for the ETSPTW instances. In addition, the hybrid algorithm is applied to a new problem set generated for the ETSPTW-MCR by extending the ETSPTW problems found in the literature. Comparisons with the ETSPTW results show that significant distance savings are found for most of the instances by charging the electric vehicle at customer locations. As a result of the computational studies, it should be concluded that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding efficient and more realistic route plans for the electric vehicles.

AB The complexity of today's e-commerce logistics environment compels practitioners to achieve a higher level of operating efficiency. As it is infeasible for operators to process a large number of discrete e-orders individually, warehouse postponement, that is, delaying the execution of a logistics process until the last possible moment, is essential. Yet the question remains as to how one can accurately identify the timing for consolidating e-orders, and subsequently releasing the grouped e-orders for batch order picking. This is a subject, lacking previous research, but is fundamentally crucial in today's e-commerce logistics environment. This paper introduces an integrated autoregressive-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (AR-ANFIS) approach for forecasting e-commerce order arrivals. Two AR-ANFIS models are built for evaluating their prediction ability against ARIMA models. The experimental results confirm the suitability of the hybrid model for forecasting e-order arrivals. To make use of the model output, an algorithm is formulated to convert e-order arrival figures into cut-off time of order grouping. In this sense, this total solution, packaged as a decision support system, namely the E-order arrival prediction system, assists logistics practitioners in judging when to release the grouped e-orders for batch processing, and essentially improves their order handling capability.

AB Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis in humans. The major disease burden of tuberculosis lies in developing countries. Lack of an effective vaccine for adults is one of the major hurdles for controlling this deadly disease. In the present study, 6 kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) of M. tuberculosis was inducibly expressed in chloroplasts of Nicotiana tabacum. The expression of ESAT-6 in chloroplasts was controlled by T7 promoter that was activated by nuclear-generated signal peptide. Tobacco plants, containing nuclear component, were transformed via biolistic bombardment with pEXP-T7-ESAT-6 obtained by Gateway (R) cloning. Transformation and homoplasmic status of transplastomic plants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting. Plants were induced for protein expression by spraying with 5% ethanol for 1 day, 3 days, 7 days and 10 days. ESAT-6 protein was detected by immunoblot analysis and maximum protein was obtained for 10 days induced plants that was estimated to accumulate up to 1.2% of total soluble fraction of protein. Transplastomic plants showed completely normal morphology. Transplastomic and untransformed plants became slightly chlorotic upon prolonged exposure to ethanol until 10 days. Taken together, this data could help in the development of an antigen-based subunit vaccine against tuberculosis.

AB Fatty aldehydes are among the most important flavor and fragrance compounds. Most biotechnological production approaches make use of the one step conversion of fatty acids from renewable sources by the enzymes alpha-dioxygenase (alpha Dox) or carboxylic acid reductase (CAR). Their reaction mechanisms and cofactor dependencies are very different. In contrast to heme-containing aDox which requires only oxygen as cosubstrate, CAR needs NADPH and ATP, which is a clear argument for the application of a whole cell catalyst. Therefore we compared fatty acid biotransformations with growing Escherichia coli cells expressing aDox or CAR to investigate their suitability for fatty aldehyde and also fatty alcohol production. Our results show the main product of fatty acid conversions with alpha Dox-expressing cells to be the expected Cn-1 aldehyde. However, 14% of the products consist of the corresponding alcohol, but in addition, 17% of the products consist of further shortened aldehydes, alcohols and acids that result from the consecutive activity of aDox and a putative endogenous fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in E. coli. Conversely, CAR-expressing cells produced only the unshortened fatty aldehyde and alcohol, whereby the latter surprisingly accounts for at least 80% of the products. The considerably higher extend of aldehyde reduction of CAR-expressing cells was shown to be causally connected to the CAR-mediated fatty acid conversion. Our study provides an overview about the applicability of alpha Dox- or CAR-based whole cell catalysts and gives a detailed description of side products as well as suggestions for tailored strain engineering.

AB C. tyrobutyricum, an acidogenic Clostridium, has aroused increasing interest due to its potential to produce biofuel efficiently. However, construction of recombinant C. tyrobutyricum for enhanced biofuel production has been impeded by the limited genetic engineering tools. In this study, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent fluorescent protein Bs2-based gene expression reporter system was developed to monitor transformation and explore in vivo strength and regulation of various promoters in C. tyrobutyricum and C. acetobutylicum. Unlike green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its variants, Bs2 can emit green light without oxygen, which makes it extremely suitable for promoter screening and transformation confirmation in organisms grown anaerobically. The expression levels of bs2 under thiolase promoters from C. tyrobutyricum and C. acetobutylicum were measured and compared based on fluorescence intensities. The capacities of the two promoters in driving secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) gene for isopropanol production in C. tyrobutyricum were distinguished, confirming that this reporter system is a convenient, effective and reliable tool for promoter strength assay and real time monitoring in C. tyrobutyricum, while demonstrating the feasibility of producing isopropanol in C. tyrobutyricum for the first time.

AB Cell counting and viability assessment is an integral part of mammalian cell line development. While manual counting with a hemocytometer is still the gold standard method, its subjectivity and high labor intensity has resulted in its reduced use in favor of automated systems. In addition, some of these automated systems offer multiwell plate based high throughput cell count, which is an asset for biopharmaceutical companies generating hundreds of high-performance cell lines per year. In this study, we used Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-K1 cells cultured in suspension in order to evaluate two automated viable-cell counters, the Guava (R) easyCyte HT and the CytoFLEX (R), for their performance in monitoring Viable Cell Density (VCD) and viability. Our results show that specificity, accuracy, precision and repeatability was comparable between the two systems and when compared to manual counting, thus providing efficient alternatives particularly when analyzing high sample numbers in a daily mode.

AB Sucrose phosphorylase (SPase) is capable of specifically catalysing transglucosylation reactions and can be employed in the enzymatic synthesis of alpha-D-glycosides. In the present study, a putative Thermobacillus SPase gene (TSPase) was synthesised with optimised codons and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The 1467 bp gene encodes a 488-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 55.8 kDa. The specific activity of the recombinant TSPase (rTSPase) was 6.42 U/mg for sucrose, and the optimum temperature and pH were 65 degrees C and pH 7.0. The T-1/2 value of the rTSPase was 212 h at 50 degrees C and 98 h at 60 degrees C. A stimulating effect on the activity of the rTSPase was observed in the presence of 5 mM Co2+. The rTSPase showed increased stability against DMSO as organic co-solvent at 50 degrees C. The K-m and k(cat) of the rTSPase with sucrose were determined as 6.24 mM and 5.73 s(-1) respectively. The rTSPase produced 2-O-alpha-D-Glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2 G) from ascorbic acid in both crude extract and whole-cell forms. A maximum yield of 19.7% (39.94 +/- 0.17 g/L) was achieved after incubation of ascorbic acid sodium salt and sucrose (1:2) with 19.76 U/mL of the rTSPase at pH 7.0 and 50 degrees C for 24 h.

AB The cost of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be reduced by improving their productivity and recovery. In this study, we attempted to obtain a high cell density culture from a 13 L bioreactor and subsequently improved the recently developed biological recovery process using mealworms to obtain the PHA granules. A cell dry weight of 161 g/L containing 68-70 wt% P(3HB) was obtained. The freeze-dried cells contained a significant amount of mineral salts from the culture medium which reduced the cells' palatability for the mealworms. A simple washing procedure with water was sufficient to remove the residual mineral salts and this improved the cells' consumption by up to 12.5% of the mealworms' body weight. As a result, one kilogram of mealworms consumed 125 g of the washed cells daily and 87.2 g of feacal pellets were recovered, which was almost twice the weight of the unwashed cells. In addition, it also improved the purity of the PHA in the faecal pellets to a value < 90% upon washing with water to remove the water-soluble compounds. This study has demonstrated a significant improvement in the production and recovery of PHA. In addition, the resulting mealworms showed a significant increase in protein content up to 79% and a decrease in fat content down to 8.3% of its dry weight.

ID BIOSYNTHETIC-PATHWAY; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; GENE; DNA
AB In metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, the number of genes expressed to achieve better production and pathway regulation in each strain is steadily increasing. The method of choice for expression in Escherichia coli is usually one or several multi-copy plasmids. Meanwhile, the industry standard for long-term, robust production is chromosomal integration of the desired genes. Despite recent advances, genetic manipulation of the bacterial chromosome remains more time consuming than plasmid construction. To allow screening of different metabolic engineering strategies at a level closer to industry while maintaining the molecular-biology advantages of plasmid-based expression, we have investigated the single-copy bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) as a development tool for metabolic engineering. Using (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate as a model product, we show that BAC can outperform multi-copy plasmids in terms of yield, productivity and specific growth rate, with respective increases of 12%, 18%, and 5%. We both show that gene expression by the BAC simplifies pathway optimization and that the phenotype of pathway expression from BAC is very close to that of chromosomal expression. From these results, we conclude that the BAC can provide a simple platform for performing pathway design and optimization.

AB Monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragmentation is a well-known degradation pathway that results in product loss and can significantly impact product quality, efficacy, or even cause immunogenic reactions, thus potentially endangering patients' health. It is recognised that residual proteases present among host cell proteins (HCPs) such as those expressed by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) can induce fragmentation, and failure of their complete removal during downstream processing could cause fragmentation during mAb production and in the final drug product. We identified, using a protease inhibitor screen, an aspartic protease that contributes to proteolytic fragmentation of partially purified mAbs in multiple projects. Subsequent LC-MS analysis indicated that cathepsin D, a typical aspartic protease, was responsible for the observed fragmentation of in-process samples. To address the issue, an alternative chromatography wash was implemented at the capture step and has been demonstrated to be an effective and scalable solution to mitigate the residual cathepsin D associated fragmentation risk. Furthermore, a near real time targeted mass spectrometry method has been developed to proactively monitor the presence of cathepsin D during upstream and downstream process. Our approach demonstrated an emerging HCP mitigation strategy through integrated upstream and downstream involvement and holds great promise for a range of future applications.

AB In vitro cultures and raw materials (fruits and leaves) of the valuable medicinal plant species - Schisandra chinensis cultivar Sadova No. 1 (SchS) - were evaluated for the production of two groups of phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and flavonoids, and their antioxidant potential. A series of experiments was conducted, aimed at optimizing culture conditions for maximum growth and phenolic production in SchS microshoots. Different concentrations of plant growth regulators (6-benzyladenine -BA and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid - NAA, from 0 to 3 mg/l) in Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium were tested in several cultivation systems (agar, agitated, bioreactor) over various growth periods (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days). Furthermore, an elicitation experiment was conducted in which the bioreactor-grown microshoots were exposed to yeast extract. HPLC-DAD analyses confirmed the presence of eight phenolic acids - chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic, gallic, neochlorogenic, protocatechuic, salicylic, syringic and vanillic, and two flavonoids: kaempferol and quercitrin, in the in vitro bio-masses. The highest total phenolic acid (357.93 mg/100 g DW) and flavonoid (105.07 mg/100 g DW) contents were obtained in agar culture extracts cultivated for 30 days on MS medium containing 2 mg/l BA and 0.5 mg/l NAA and for 50 days on MS medium containing 0.1 mg/l BA and 2 mg/l NAA, respectively. These amounts were 1.59- and 5.95-fold lower than in parent plant leaf extracts (569.66 mg/100 g DW), and 4.30- and 1.25-fold higher than in fruit extracts (83.17 mg/100 g DW), respectively. Microshoots grown in a Plantform bioreactor also proved to be a good source of phenolic compounds, however, the elicitor treatment had no noticeable effect on their accumulation. Antioxidant capacity assessed by the Folin-Ciocalteu, FRAP, DPPH and CUPRAC assays revealed significantly higher potential in extracts from in vitro biomass and leaves of the parent plant, as compared to the parent plant fruit extracts.

AB Solitary aculeate wasps are abundant and diverse hymenopteran insects that disable prey using venom. The venom may possess neuromodulation, immunomodulatory, metabolic-modulatory and antimicrobial functions. Venom analysis of transcriptomes and proteomes has been previously performed in social and parasitoid wasp species. We develop methodologies including mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics to analyse the protein constituents from venom sacs of the solitary aculeate wasp Cerceris tybyensis. The venom sac constituents of C. rybyensis are discussed with respect to other wasp species.

AB The soluble venom of the scorpion Tityus macrochirus was separated by chromatographic procedures and three homogeneous peptides were obtained and their primary structures were determined. They were called: Tma1-Tma3, from the abbreviated name of the scorpion. Tma1 is a peptide containing 65 amino acids with four disulfide linkages and a molecular weight of 7386.2 Da. It is a mammalian toxin, shown to affect human sodium-channels sub-types hNav1.6 and hNav1.4. Tma2 and Tma3 are peptides containing 69 amino acids linked by four disulfide bonds, molecular weights 7819.7 and 7830.0 Da, respectively. They do not affect human sodium-channels but are lethal to insects (crickets). A phylogenic analysis of the three peptides and those of other toxic peptides isolated from the genus Tityus and Centruroides were grouped together and analyzed, permitting to obtain a topology with two main clades, one includes most sodium-channel anti-insect scorpion toxins and others includes mostly sodium-channel scorpion toxins anti-mammalian. Tma1 segregates among a group of well-studied beta-class toxins of other Tityus species such as T. discrepans, T. obscurus and T. pachyurus. Tma2 and Tma3 are associated with anti-insect toxins, particularly with one of T. obscurus. This phylogenetic analysis confirms and enforces our experimental results obtained with these three new sodium-channel scorpion toxins.

ID FOCAL HAND; GRIP
AB Background: Writer's cramp (WC) is a form of focal hand dystonia, for which focal botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections are the current best therapy. Past studies have shown that some types of rehabilitative therapy can be useful. We hypothesized that BoNT together with a specific type of occupational therapy would be better than BoNT alone for treating WC patients comparing the effects with a patient-rated subjective scale.
   Methods: Twelve WC patients were randomized to two groups. Six received only BoNT therapy and 6 received BoNT & occupational therapy. The occupational therapy involved specific exercises of finger movements in the direction opposite to the dystonic movements during writing. BoNT was injected by movement disorders neurologists in the affected muscles under electromyography-guidance. The primary outcome was the patient-rated subjective scale at 20 weeks. Secondary exploratory outcomes included the writer's cramp rating scale (WCRS), writer's cramp impairment scale (WCIS), the writer's cramp disability scale (WCDS), handgrip strength and kinetic parameters.
   Results: The patient-rated subjective scale scores at 20 weeks were not significantly different between the two groups. Significant objective improvement was noted in the BoNT & occupational therapy group, as noted by the decrease (28%) in WCIS scores.
   Conclusions: Improvement of the primary outcome measure, the patient-rated subjective scale, was not achieved. However, significant improvement was found in the BoNT & occupational therapy group in a secondary measure of impairment. Our hypothesis-driven study results are likely limited by small sample size, and further large-scale studies of occupational therapy methods to improve the efficacy of BoNT seems worthwhile.

AB The cyanobacterium Radiocystis fernandoi has been frequently identified in cyanobacterial blooms in Brazil. Recently, R. fernandoi strain R28, which produces microcystin (MC)-RR and MC-YR, was isolated from the Furnas reservoir, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The present study evaluated the hematological variables and erythrocyte antioxidant responses, lipid peroxidation (LPG), and genotoxicity in a neotropical fish (Hoplias malabaricus) after acute and subchronic exposure to a crude extract (CE) of R. fernandoi strain R28. Acute exposure (12 or 96 h) consisted of a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) CE injection, and subchronic exposure consisted of one i.p. CE injection every 72 h for 30 days. After acute exposure, fish exhibited macrocytic anemia (12 h post-injection) followed by normocytic anemia (96 h post-injection). The increased activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, and the glutathione level in the erythrocytes did not prevent oxidative stress, manifested as lipid peroxidation and elevated DNA damage after acute exposure. After subchronic exposure, the hematological variables recovered, and the absence of erythrocyte oxidative stress suggests possible modulation by other biological factors, including a possible decrease in MC uptake by the cells and/or increasing detoxification efficiency that precludes erythrocyte damage.

AB The hypothesis of this experiment is that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are involved in the genesis of the bone metaplasia caused by Solanum glaucophyllum intoxication. We determined using liquid chromatography that 1 mL of plant extract contained 3.8 mu l of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3. The ability of 100 mu L, 1 mL and 5 mL of extract/L, containing 1 nM (0.4 mu g/L), 10 nM (4 mu g/L) and 50 nM (20 mu g/L) of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3, respectively, in inducing the osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow MSCs from rats was tested. At the concentrations of 1 and 5 mL of extract/L of culture medium without osteogenesis-inducing factors, the plant extract induced the osteogenic differentiation of the MSCs, as was evidenced by the greater synthesis of mineralized matrix. At the higher concentration (5 mL of extract/L), an increase in the relative expression of BMP-2 gene was observed. It was concluded that rat bone marrow MSC culture is a good model for studying the effects of the S. glaucophyllum extract on the osteogenic differentiation of undifferentiated cells. Also, S. glaucophyllum extracts containing 10 nM (4 mu g/L) and 50 nM (20 mu g/L) of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 induce the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, suggesting that this is one of the mechanisms by which S. glaucophyllum causes bone metaplasia.

AB Green pit viper (Trimeresurus trigonocephalus) is endemic to Sri Lanka and bites are reported from tropical rain forest and plantation areas. As scant data exists on clinico-epidemiological features of Sri Lankan green pit viper bite, objective of this study was to address this knowledge gap. A prospective observational study was conducted in Base Hospital Deniyaya from October 2013 to September 2015. Green pit viper as the offending snake was identified when the victims brought live or dead specimens. When the specimen was not available, green pit viper was identified by the victim pointing to preserved specimens and photographs of green pit viper and different similar appearing snakes. Clinical details were recorded during the hospital stay. Twenty four green pit viper bite patients (17-68 years) were studied. All cases were daytime bites despite green pit viper being a nocturnally active snake. Sixteen patients (67%) were bitten while they were working in tea plantation. Hands (42%), feet, (33%), forearms (8%), legs (8%), thighs (4%) and shoulders (4%) were the sites of bites. Thirteen (54%) had extensive limb swelling. Nine (38%) had local swelling and two had no swelling. Three (12.5%) developed haemorrhagic blisters. Four (17%) had regional lymphadenopathy. Two (8%) developed non clotting blood by the TWBCT.
   Green pit viper bites caused substantial morbidity. Risk factors included day time outdoor activities in bordering villages of tropical rain forests and occupation. Pain, extensive limb swelling and bite site swelling were prominent clinical features. However haemorrhagic blisters, regional lymphadenopathy and coagulopathy were reported. Nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity were notably absent.

Oxidative stress was shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of microcystin LR by the induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation that oxidize and damage cellular macromolecules. In the present study we examined the effect of acute MC-LR dose on the cardiac muscle of BALB/c mice. Afterwards, melatonin and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) were assayed and evaluated as potential protective and antioxidant agents against damages generated by MC-LR. For this purpose, thirty mice were assigned into six groups of five mice each. The effect of MC-LR was first compared to the control group supplied with distilled water, then compared to the other groups supplied with melatonin and NAC. The experiment lasted 10 days after which animals were euthanized. Biomarkers of toxicity such as alkaline phosphatase activity, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content, reduced glutathione content, serum lactate dehydrogenase and serum sorbitol dehydrogenase were assayed. Results showed that toxin treated mice have experienced significant oxidative damage in their myocardial tissue as revealed by noticeable levels of oxidative stress biomarkers and by the reduction in alkaline phosphatase activity. Whereas, melatonin and NAC treated mice manifested lesser oxidative damages. Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic use of melatonin and N-acetyl cysteine as antioxidant protective agents against oxidative damage induced by MC-LR.

AB Sexually dimorphic traits are widespread across metazoans and are often the result of sex-specific inheritance or sex-based differences in gene expression. Intersexual differences have even been observed in invertebrate venoms, although the identification of these differences has been limited to the more well-studied groups, such as scorpions and spiders, where sex-based differences in morphology and behavior are apparent. Recent studies on centipede venom have identified evidence of intraspecific variation, but intersexual differences have not been reported. To investigate the potential for sex-based differences in centipede venom composition, we performed reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analyses on five male and 15 female eastern bark centipedes (Hemiscolopendra marginata) from the Apalachicola National Forest in northern Florida. After detecting a significant sex-based difference in H. marginata venom composition, we completed a high-throughput venom-gland transcriptomic and venom proteomic analysis of one male and one female to determine the genetic basis for differences in venom composition. We identified 47 proteomically confirmed toxins and 717 nontoxin transcripts in H. marginata venom-glands. Of these proteomically confirmed toxins, the most abundantly expressed in the male venom included ion channel-modulating toxins and toxins so divergent from any characterized homologs that they could not be given a functional classification, whereas the most abundantly expressed in the female venom were gamma-glutamyl transferases and CAPs (cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins). These differences were then confirmed by performing replicate LC-MS/MS analyses on the venom from an additional three male and three female H. marginata. Our RP-HPLC and high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic approach resulted in not only an in-depth characterization of H. marginata venom, but represents the first example of sex-based variation in centipede venoms.

TI Experimental antivenom against serine proteases from the Bothrops

AB In Brazil, snakes from the Bothrops genus are responsible for thousands of accidents, and their venoms are mainly made up of proteolytic enzymes. Although the antibothropic serum produced by the Butantan Institute is remarkable in saving lives, studies show that some symptoms observed in cases of envenoming are not efficiently neutralized. Moreover, our group has shown that the commercial antivenom does not fully neutralize in vitro some serine proteases present in the Bothrops jararaca venom. Therefore, this study focuses on a new method in the production of specific immunoglobulins capable of neutralizing the activities of these enzymes in vitro. For this, a pool of serine proteases that was not inhibited by the commercial antivenom, made up of four enzymes (KN-BJ2, BjSP, HS112 and BPA) from the B. jararaca venom was obtained through two chromatographic steps (DEAE-HPLC and C8-RP-HPLC). The identities of these proteases were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, followed by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. This pool was inoculated into BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, using SBA-15 as adjuvant, and the produced IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography. The sera were characterized by ELISA, avidity and proteolytic neutralization assays. Both animal models responded to the immunization, producing higher IgGs titers when compared to the commercial antivenom. The experimental serum from BALB/c mice presented a better hydrolysis inhibition of the selective fluorescent substrate for serine proteases (similar to 80%) when compared to C57BL/6 (similar to 25%) and the commercial antivenom ( < 1%) at the dose of 500:1 (weight of antivenom:weight of venom). These results show that a different immunization method using isolated serine proteases improves the toxins neutralizing efficacy and could lead to a better end product to be used as a supplemental medicine to the currently used immunotherapy.

AB Although underreported across the Amazon region, scorpion stings are very prevalent in some areas and can be potentially life-threatening, especially in children. The most vulnerable populations are those living in locations far from the capitals, hence having limited access to the health system where the appropriate structure for the treatment of severe cases is found. An abundant and diverse fauna of scorpions is found in the region, but few studies have been conducted to decipher the clinical characteristics and therapeutic response of the available antivenoms in envenomings caused by the various species. Antivenom underdosage as well as delayed medical assistance are common among indigenous populations, resulting in poor outcome rates. An in depth understanding of the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of scorpion sting envenomings in the Amazon is necessary to improve the outcome of these cases.

AB A study of the mechanism responsible for the zearalenone (ZEA) neutralization by lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus laths 56 and L929 cell line was carried out by determination of the kinetics of the binding process. In the case of prokaryotic cells the biosorption process was non-linear and three steps were identified. The maximum efficiency of zearalenone binding to L. lactic was almost 30% and no metabolites were observed. In turn, for eukaryotic cells only two steps of the binding process were differentiated, and the efficiency of zearalenone binding was 53.99%. Furthermore, L929 cell line metabolizes zearalenone to alpha-ZOL and beta-ZOL. Additionally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used for description of the structural changes at the protein and lipid level, while Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was applied to detect changes at the molecular level.

AB The intraspecific geographical venom variations of Calloselasma rhodostoma from Malaysia (CR-M), Indonesia (CR-I), Thailand (CR-T) and Vietnam (CR-V) were investigated through 10 SDS-PAGE and nano-ESI-LCMS/MS. The venom antigenicity, procoagulant activities and neutralization using Thai C. rhodostoma Monovalent Antivenom (CRMAV) were also investigated. SDS-PAGE patterns of the venoms were relatively similar with minor variations. Proteomic analysis revealed that snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs, particularly P-I class), serine proteases (SVSPs) and snaclecs dominated the venom protein composition (68.96-81.80%), followed by L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) and phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) (7.37-11.08% and 5.18-13.81%, respectively), corroborating C. rhodostoma envenoming effects (hemorrhage, consumptive coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and local tissue necrosis). Other proteins of lower abundances (2.82-9.13%) identified include cysteinerich secretory proteins (CRISP), phospholipase B, phosphodiesterase, nerve growth factor, 5'-nucleotidase, aminopeptidase and hyaluronidase. All four venoms exhibited strong procoagulant effects which were neutralized by CRMAV to different extents. CRMAV immunoreactivity was high toward venoms of CR-M, CR-I and CR-T but relatively low for CR-V venom. Among the venom samples from different locales, CR-V venom proteome has the smallest SVMP composition while SVSP, PLA(2) and phosphodiesterase were more abundant in the venom. These variations in C. rhodostoma venom protein composition could partly explain the differences seen in immunoreactivity.

AB Here, Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) was studied to analyze the effects of 0.5 mg L-1 naphthalene and 0.05 mg L-1 phenanthrene on profiles of cell growth, chlorophyll-a content and Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) production at different pH values. The results indicated that for both the naphthalene and phenanthrene treatments, the specific growth rates were higher in pH 10.0 than in either pH 7.0 or pH 5.0. In the presence of low concentrations of naphthalene or phenanthrene, chlorophyll-a in medium increased significantly more in pH 10.0 than pH 5.0. chlorophyll-a in cell was significantly lowered when exposed to naphthalene in both pH 10.0 and pH 7.0, and was higher when exposed to phenanthrene in pH 10.0 than pH 5.0. HPLC analysis revealed that the extracellular MC Lit concentrations in M. aeruginosa exposed to either naphthalene or phenanthrene were lower than in control M. aeruginosa at pH 5.0. The intracellular MC-LR levels in toxic M. aeruginosa cells exposed to naphthalene or phenanthrene were higher than in the controls at pH 10.0. Our study suggests that the MC-LR production of M. aeruginosa was affected by the pH value when low concentrations of either naphthalene or phenanthrene were present in the water. These results indicate that the pH value should not be ignored when evaluating the risk of chemicals that promote MC LR production in eutrophic waters.

AB Membrane-anchored heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is the receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT). Mutated or truncated, non-toxic DT has been used earlier for HB-EGF-targeted drug delivery and to modulate HB-EGF signaling. In the present work, we have synthesized a peptide corresponding to a 26 amino acid long stretch of the receptor-binding domain of DT. This region of DT makes multiple contacts with HB-EGF and has residues critical for binding to HB-EGF. We show that this peptide and two of its mutants bind to HB-EGF. We have also created recombinant proteins by fusing Maltose-binding Protein (MBP) with these peptides. These recombinant MBP-tagged peptides bind to HB-EGF with affinities in the range of 10(-7) to 10(-8) M. We have observed that these MBP-tagged peptides can modulate molecular signaling of HB-EGF. Therefore, this 26 amino acid long stretch of DT can be considered as an independent functional segment for binding to HB-EGF. Peptides corresponding to this region may be used for HB-EGF targeted cellular delivery of molecular cargo or to modulate HB-EGF signaling.

AB Using molecular dynamics simulation, we study the plastic zone created during nanoindentation of a large CuZr glass system. The plastic zone consists of a core region, in which virtually every atom undergoes plastic rearrangement, and a tail, where the density distribution of the plastically active atoms decays to zero. Compared to crystalline substrates, the plastic zone in metallic glasses is significantly smaller than in crystals. The so-called plastic-zone size factor, which relates the radius of the plastic zone to the contact radius of the indenter with the substrate, assumes values around 1, while in crystals depending on the crystal structure - values of 2-3 are common. The small plastic zone in metallic glasses is caused by the essentially homogeneous deformation in the amorphous matrix, while in crystals heterogeneous dislocations prevail, whose growth leads to a marked extension of the plastic zone.

AB It has been suggested by recent studies that atmospheric particles adopt non-crystalline states which significantly impact aerosol-cloud interactions and atmospheric chemistry. In this study, the effect of non-crystalline states on water diffusion is detailed investigated from single multi-component particles levitated in aerosol optical tweezers. We infer the time-dependent particle size from Raman spectra using Mie fitting, thus derive the water diffusion coefficient (D-water) from particle radius changes during evaporation or condensation processes. In both glassy states (in saccharide particles) and gel states (in MgSO4 particles), the bulk phase water diffusion is shown to be severely restricted, thus limiting the gas-particle water partitioning on the particle surface. The D-water of glassy particles generally gradually decreases as the RH decreases, while the relative humidity (RH) - D-water relationship of particle in gel state is complicated and brings huge deviation of D-water determination. We therefore present the time dependent water content at different location (radial coordinate) of the particle. The time scale required for particle to get equilibrium to environmental RH is vastly extended by the kinetic inhibition of bulk phase water transfer. This can give direct and quantitative indication of water diffusion within single non-crystalline particle and its effect on gas-particle partitioning and equilibrium.

AB In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to explore the deformation mechanism of amorphous/crystalline Cu50Ag50 phase-separated alloys with different crystal fractions during compressive deformation. Our findings indicate that as the crystal fractions increase, the yield strength also increases and there is a conspicuous strain-hardening phenomenon, especially for samples with a large crystal fraction. The cross-interaction of immature shear bands (ISBs) in different directions in crystals will hinder the extension and expansion of each other, resulting in a "strain-hardening". Moreover, the shear-induced growth and the dissolution of the nanocrystals within the shear bands are observed. Structural transformation from body-centered cubic structure to face-centered cubic or hexagonal close-packed structures is induced by deformation. These atomic-scale observations reveal a novel deformation mechanism that can effectively improve the mechanical properties of metallic glasses.

AB Changes of FTIR, UV-Visible spectra, photoluminescence with varying Sm content in phosphate glass containing sodium, lead and aluminum were studied. Refractive index values have been measured and their values were listed to be between similar to 1.5-1.7. Furthermore the effect of subjecting this glass to gamma rays was also investigated. The results showed that glass containing 1%Sm had the highest NBOs according to FTIR, UV-Visble results. The optical energy band gap and Urbach values supported this assumption. The presence of Sm3+ which can be reduced to Sm2+ in addition to the NBOs produced due to the addition of Sm ions in the glass matrix, causing a reduction of gamma rays effect. This may give a clue to the ability of using this glass as an immobilizer or shielded for gamma rays or as a burial for high energy radioactive materials.

AB Glassy system of composition 20R(2)O-19ZnO-60B(2)O(3)-1V(2)O(5) (R is Li, Na and K) was prepared by conventional melting technique. The measured density rho and calculated molar volume V-m were both found to increase linearly with the atomic number of the alkali element, reflecting the formation of non-bridging oxygen. Additional physical parameters such as vanadium ions concentration, inter-ionic distance of vanadium ions, polaron radius, field strength, refractive index and electrical susceptibility were calculated. Infrared spectra were recorded, vibrational modes were assigned, and the spectra were deconvoluted to calculate the N-4 value. The absorption edge and optical band gap were estimated from UV-Vis absorption spectra, and were found to exhibit a clear R2O mol% dependence. The Spin Hamiltonian parameters were calculated from ESR spectra, and the V4+ ions were found to exist as VO2+ ions in octahedral coordination with tetragonal compression. Furthermore, the Delta g(parallel to)/Delta g perpendicular to values were decreased with R2O mol% indicating a reduced tetragonal distortion.

AB In the quest of corrosion-resistant biomaterials, the emergence of metallic glasses is a welcome stimulus, however, their progress is potentially impeded by the complex fabrication routes. This paper explores a Zr(40)Ti(35)Ni(14)Nb(11 )metallic glass, developed through combinatorial magnetron co-sputtering. Structural characterization of the system via Grazing-Incidence X-Ray Diffraction and Transmission Electron Microscopy coupled with Fourier Transformation demonstrate single phase homogeneous amorphous structure. The metallic glass, upon comparative electrochemical examination in physiological solution, displays relatively better corrosion resistance properties than conventional biomaterials, i.e. stainless steel 316L and commercially pure titanium, by an order of magnitude lower corrosion current density, (17 nA/cm(2)), lower passive current density (3.1 mu A/cm(2)), invulnerability to pitting corrosion and one-order higher charge transfer resistance (6.9 M Omega.cm(2)). The superior corrosion resistance properties are ascribed to the synergistic effect of chemically and structurally homogeneous amorphous structure and protective passive film, enriched with chemically stable oxides of Zr and Ti. Mechanical characterization of the metallic glass via nanoindentation studies reveal high hardness (7.1 GPa) and fairly low elastic modulus (121.7 GPa), making it a candidate material for bioimplants.

AB Crystallization behavior, structure and properties of the glasses in SrO-Fe2O3-P2O5 ternary system, with the content of P2O5 fixed to be 60, 50 and 40 mol%, were studied systematically. For vitreous samples, thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) and characteristic temperature were obtained by using a thermal dilatometer, while their thermal stability was examined by using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Accordingly, their heat treatment schedules were determined. Furthermore, their chemical durability was characterized according to the dissolution rate (DRwater) in distilled water at 90 degrees C. Glass forming region of the SrO-Fe2O3-P2O5 ternary system at 1250 degrees C has been identified. It was found that crystallization behavior, crystalline phase compositions, structure and properties of the samples are closely related to the ratios of O/P and Fe/P. Specifically, the iron phosphate glasses were explored as the host matrices to immobilize high-level radioactive wastes (HLWs) with high contents of Sr-90.

AB The Al-induced crystallization of amorphous (alpha)-Si under thermal annealing and swift heavy ion irradiation has been investigated. The c-Al (50 nm)/alpha-Si (150 nm) thin films have been prepared on thermally oxidized Sisubstrates. A set of samples have been annealed at temperatures ranging from 100 degrees C to 500 degrees C to achieve crystallization. Another set of similar samples have been irradiated at an elevated temperature of 100 degrees C using 100 MeV Ni+7 ions at finances of 1 x 10(12) ions-cm(-2), 5 x 10(12) ions-cm(-2), 1 x 10(13) ions-cm(-2), and 5 x 10(13) ions-cm(-2). The crystallization of alpha-Si is observed at annealing temperature of 200 degrees C. The crystallinity increases with increasing temperature. On the other hand, irradiation using swift heavy ion leads to crystallization of alpha-Si at significantly lower temperature of 100 degrees C. The irradiation induced crystallization is explained in terms of creation of vacancies, interstitials and mixing of Si and Al atoms at alpha-Si/c-metal interface due to energy deposited by swift Ni ions.

AB Structural changes developed in Ge-S glassy alloy with incorporation of Ga have been investigated using vibrational spectroscopy. Thermal evaporation technique has been employed to deposit thin films of Ge20S80-xGax glassy alloy. Structural transformations in bulk and thin films have been examined from Raman and FTIR spectra recorded at room temperature. Observed left shift in the Raman spectra and right shift in the IR spectra are consequence of increase in reduced mass of the alloy. Ga occupy the Ge sites, due to atomic similarity, and results in the formation of Ge(Ga)S-4 tetrahedra units and S3Ge(Ga)-(Ga)GeS3 ethane like structures. Broadening of IR and Raman bands with Ga concentration reveals the conception of Ga-S bonds. Chemical changes developed in the Ge-S-Ga glass have been correlated with XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) chemical shift. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal the existence of metal-metal and S-S bonds in violation to the chemical ordered network model.

AB The self-crystallization phenomenon in glass can provide low-phonon energy environment for the up-conversion of luminescence centers. Nevertheless, the crystallization mechanism is not clear, hence the effect of temperature on the self-crystallization of Ba2LaF7: Er3+/Yb3+ glass-ceramics via adjusting its melting temperature has investigated. The self-crystallization fraction of Ba2LaF7 has decreased with the increase in melting temperature. The Fourier transforms infrared spectra, X-ray Fluorescence analysis and differential thermal analysis revealed that the increase in temperature makes the Si-O bond longer in the glass, resulting in the increase of activation energy for crystallization instead of precipitating the crystals.

The glass systems were prepared using the conventional melt-quenching technique. The thermal properties of the glasses were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Thermal analysis of the glasses was realized regarding the glass transition temperature (T-g), glass crystallization temperature (T-c), and glass stability against crystallization (Delta T). Quantitative analysis of the T-g of the glass samples was discussed based on the total number of bonds per unit volume and average stretching force constant of each bond in each glass composition. Debye temperature, softening temperature and thermal expansion coefficient, (alpha(p)) of the glass samples were calculated based on the measured ultrasonic velocities and densities data. The addition of PbO improved the thermal properties in the binary PbO-TeO2 glasses, while the addition of ZnO showed the different trend to the thermal properties of the ternary ZnO-PbO-TeO2 glasses.

AB A new glass system of calcium-alumino-silicate doped with Sm2O3 and co-doped with Sm2O3 +/- Eu2O3 was fabricated in order to improve the efficiency of the red emission for phosphor glass materials. The optical properties of the glass samples were studied by measurements using UV-vis absorption spectra and excitation energy. The results showed that 403 nm of photon energy is effective to elevate the electron in a ground state to an excited state. This photon energy was used to study the emission spectra and energy transfer. The luminescence intensity O/R ratio of the glass samples showed a stronger red shift colour with an increase in the dopants. Moreover, the quantum yield (QY) of the glass samples was measured, and the results showed that Eu2O3 can increase the QY by acting as activator. These results indicate that the glass samples are a good potential candidate for LED applications.

AB Amorphous silicon carbon nitride (a-SiCN) films were prepared on boron-doped silicon and quartz substrates by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The films were characterized by using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, as well the results of the measurements of optical spectra, photoluminescence (PL) and current-voltage characteristics. The films demonstrate high optical transparency and the energy gap similar to 3.4 eV. The PL spectra consist of three bands at 395, 500 and 526 nm that are caused by the electronic recombination in the Si-C-N-H-O network. Forward and reverse current-voltage characteristics were measured in the temperature range of 196-353 K. The forward current is explained by unipolar space-charge-limited (SCL) current mechanism with an exponential distribution of trap states in a local energy band. The reverse current is limited by the depletion region in the p-Si substrate. Basic electrical parameters of a-SiCN layers are determined from the SCL current measurements.

AB The interaction between scratches has a significant influence on the material removal mechanism during scratching glass ceramic. To clarify the interaction mechanism, an analytical model of stress interference considering scratch distance is established based on the interaction features between scratches to analyse the relationship between stress distribution and crack propagation. A double scratch experiment with different scratch distances was conducted on lithium aluminosilicate (LAS) glass ceramics. Experimental and analytical results show that the crack is further extended by the enhanced maximum principal stress in the case of the scratch interference. In the interaction range, the maximum principal stress decreases with increasing scratch distance. Furthermore, larger scratch distance in the interaction range is prone to achieve ductile material removal while smaller scratch distance makes the brittle material removal occurring.

AB The atomic structure of chalcogenide glasses in the composition of As35Se60-xTexBi5 (x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20) is investigated by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and HR-XPS. All results present the consistent evidences on association of Te addition with the structural evolution of glasses. XRD patterns show that the Te can be added into the As35Se60Bi5 system to substitute Se by maximum 15 mol% without causing crystallization. Raman and HR-XPS spectra demonstrate that the substitution of Te for Se is closely related to formation of locally ordered nanostructure in glass network. In low concentration, Te atoms are preferentially bonded with As rather than Bi, forming mixed [AsSe3-xTex] pyramid units. With the increasing of Te content, Te atoms tend to be bonded with Bi to form [BiSe3-xTex] units. In the case of Te incorporation over 20 mol%, the Bi-Te bond becomes further strengthened, inducing the precipitation of the sole thermoelectric crystals (Bi2Se3-xTex).

AB Innovation has become a key interest in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), as it is argued to be pervasive, and plays an eminent role in generating employment. There is, however, a dearth of empirical evidence assessing the impact of innovation on firm employment for SSA. This paper investigates the impact of product innovations on job creation using data from the recent waves of the Enterprise Survey merged with Innovation Follow-Up Survey for SSA countries for which both surveys are available. We apply the Dose Response Model under continuous and heterogeneous responses to treatment. The results reveal a positive impact of product innovations on total employment. This result is, however, found to hold only at specific intervals of product innovation intensities. Our analyses also show that product innovations tend to create both temporary and permanent jobs as well as skilled and unskilled jobs. However, the positive impact of product innovations on temporary and unskilled employment tends to outweigh that of permanent and skilled employment, raising questions about the security and quality of the new jobs generated by product innovations.

AB In this article, I study the relationship between valuable trademarks and a firm's technology sourcing strategy. The Profiting from Innovation (PFI) and Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) perspectives have generated competing predictions regarding firms' historical stock of valuable trademarks and their decision to pursue external technology sourcing. To conduct the empirical analysis, I use a sample of innovator firms in the manufacturing sectors from the Division of Innovative Labor survey, matched to the USPTO trademark data. Consistent with the TCE perspective, I find that firms with valuable trademarks are less likely to commercialize external inventions, and are likely to have lower innovation performance if they do so. I further show a boundary condition for PFI such that when firms are new entrants to an industry but already holding valuable trademarks, they are more likely to commercialize external innovations.

AB We investigate the influence of public R&D subsidies on a firm's likelihood to form technological collaborations. Using signaling theory, we conceptualize the award of a subsidy as a pointing signal (i.e., indicating a quality attribute that distinguishes the signaler from its competitors), and the monetary amount raised through a subsidy as an activating signal (i.e., activating the quality attribute of the signaler). Drawing on the attention-based view, we investigate whether the relative salience of these signals varies between two types of signal receivers: academic and corporate partners. Using a panel sample of Spanish manufacturing firms, our results indicate that the two types of receivers attend to the two signals differently: while academic partners attend to pointing signals only (sent by the award of a selective subsidy), corporate partners react to the richer information that activating signals provide (sent by the monetary value of both selective and automatic subsidies). Our results are stronger for SMEs vis-a-vis large firms, and hold after controlling for endogeneity, selection bias, simultaneity, attrition, inter-temporal patterns in technological collaborations, and the substantive effects of subsidies. The theorized and tested dual nature of subsidy-enabled signals and their different salience to distinct partner types hold interesting implications for research on alliances, innovation policy, and signals.

AB Most Engineering and Technology (E&T) graduates in emerging countries are not educated to the same quality level as E&T graduates in advanced countries, and this may require firms to make significant on-the-job training investments to prepare these graduates for R&D positions. In this paper, we present research findings from a study of 10 firms located in India (both multinationals and local firms), through 65 interviews and extensive secondary data, to establish how these firms form teaching-focused collaborations with universities to train students with the pre-requisite skills necessary for R&D operations while simultaneously reducing on-the-job training investment. We suggest the viability of teaching-focused industry-academia (I-A) collaborations as a talent recruitment strategy in emerging countries. We also demonstrate the potential of such collaborations to provide an alternative to the traditional graduate recruitment and development model: 'on-the-job training'. Through the identification of different forms of teaching-focused I A collaborations aimed at enhancing both theoretical knowledge and industry and firm-specific practical and applied skills in graduates, along with their associated drivers and challenges, this paper strengthens a much-neglected dimension of the I-A collaboration literature: the role of collaborative activities for teaching between industry and university.

AB Errors and biases in published results compromise the reliability of empirical research, posing threats to the cumulative research process and to evidence-based decision making. We provide evidence on reporting errors and biases in innovation research. We find that 45% of the articles in our sample contain at least one result for which the provided statistical information is not consistent with reported significance levels. In 25% of the articles, at least one strong reporting error is diagnosed where a statistically non-significant finding becomes significant or vice versa using the common significance threshold of 0.1. The error rate at the test level is very small with 4.0% exhibiting any error and 1.4% showing strong errors. We also find systematically more marginally significant findings compared to marginally non-significant findings at the 0.05 and 0.1 thresholds of statistical significance. These discontinuities indicate the presence of reporting biases. Explorative analysis suggests that discontinuities are related to authors' affiliations and to a lesser extent the article's rank in the issue and the style of reporting.

AB Crowdsourcing is a particular form of open innovation (OI) that aims to boost idea-generation in innovation processes. The underlying rationale is that the collective intelligence of a large number of contributors outside the firm's boundaries increases the likelihood of achieving 'extreme outcomes', L e., high quality ideas with exceptional business potential. Due to the idiosyncrasies that differentiate crowdsourcing from other forms of OI, the findings from prior research on the performance implications of OI cannot be directly extended to crowdsourcing. Similarly, the findings on the effect of internal R&D on firm performance cannot be directly applied to crowdsourcing due to the greater uncertainty in dealing with a crowd of unknown individuals outside the organization whose ideas have to be evaluated and ultimately processed internally. Thus, while crowdsourcing research has recently burgeoned, it is ambiguous as to whether and when crowdsourcing is beneficial for firms. In fact, the overall effect of crowdsourcing on a firm's future profits has not been thoroughly investigated. To fill this gap, we conducted an event study analyzing stock market reactions to crowdsourcing announcements, a forward-looking market-based measure able to isolate the effect of crowdsourcing on a firm's future profits, which we refer to as firm stock market performance. Drawing on the resource-based view, we argue that an external crowd can become a valuable resource if the firm is able to extract value from it. Our findings show that two key contingency factors, Le., brand value and investment opportunities, determine the boundary conditions that enable firms to extract value from the crowd, resulting in a positive stock market reaction to the announcement of a crowdsourcing campaign. In addition to advancing scholarly knowledge on crowdsourcing, our results provide practitioners with relevant indications for profitable crowdsourcing campaigns.

AB Intellectual property (IP) rights have become an important strategic battleground, in which IP owners increasingly build barriers that impede firms from operating in the marketplace. Although research has examined property preemption as one approach to defend against being blocked by others' IP, a broader palette of defensive IP measures to address problems of missing access to external IP has received less scrutiny. In quantitative analyses of a representative survey of German firms, we find that key firm-level attributes-firm scope, innovation expenses, product innovation, collaboration breadth, and use of patents-are associated with a need to use such defensive IP measures. We also examine the firm-level attributes associated with a firm's choice among eight possible types of strategies for IP defense, and how certain types of defensive IP measures are systematically interrelated in use. Qualitative interviews with seventeen intellectual property practitioners complement, and help to interpret, our quantitative findings. Implications for future research, and for managers and policymakers are discussed.

AB This paper contributes to the literature on the effect of research evaluation in terms of preserving and reproducing diversity. Through a large-scale natural experiment encompassing two entire cohorts of Italian economists, we document how candidates for academic positions, especially top-tier positions, in economics are pushed to increasingly conform to a standardised research profile. We find evidence of gender bias in research evaluation and observe substantial variability in the chances of qualifying for an academic position, depending on candidates' main fields, topics and methods of research. Our results also indicate that economists working on less popular research fields and/or with heterodox methods are less likely to qualify for top-tier academic positions, independently of their bibliometric indicators.

AB Interdisciplinary research (IDR) has raised increasing expectations among scholars and policymakers about its potential to produce ground-breaking scientific contributions and satisfy societal demands. While existing research highlights that novel connections across fields is beneficial for scientific contributions with high academic impact, comparatively less is known about whether IDR is positively associated to scientists' engagement with non-academic actors. To investigate this, we examine whether there is a systematic relationship between scientists' IDR-orientation and their interactions with industry. We conceptually distinguish four stylized modes of interaction (firm creation, technology transfer, co-production and response modes) and employ three distinct indicators of IDR. We use data on 1,170 scientists affiliated to public research organizations in Spain, bibliometric dataset of scientists' publications, and details of scientists' past involvement in interactions with industry. Our results show that IDR has a transversal influence on all four modes. However, IDR-oriented scientists are more strongly associated to transactional (market-mediated) compared to relational (personal-based) interaction mechanisms; while we find no evidence of a significant difference between IDR-oriented scientists and their propensity to engage in different modes of U-I interaction according to the degree of goal specificity.

AB A considerable body of work acknowledges the importance and benefits of the university-industry relationship for the economy and society, but also for increasing the revenue of universities themselves (known also as universities' "third mission"). However, questions have also been raised about the consequences of the university-industry relationship and its impact on their traditional role. This paper contributes to this debate by exploring whether and how being efficient in generating income from engagement activities impacts on universities' research performance. By using a sample of 119 UK higher educational institutions for period 2007-2014, and controlling for endogeneity issue, the results show that efficiency in terms of university-industry income and research performance exhibits a nonlinear relationship for both universities established before ("old universities"), and after ("new universities"), the Higher Education Act 1992 (HEA). However, for high level of efficiency, "old universities" do not appear able to improve their research performance further. Finally, positive synergies between the third mission and research mission decline in a more teaching-oriented environment. We conclude that policy makers should account for organisational heterogeneity and teaching orientation to promote research excellence effectively by stimulating engagement.

AB Test beds and living labs have emerged as a prominent approach to foster innovation across geographical regions and technical domains. They feed on the popular "grand societal challenges" discourse and the growing insight that adequate policy responses to these challenges will require drastic transformations of technology and society alike. Test beds and living labs represent an experimental, co-creative approach to innovation policy that aims to test, demonstrate, and advance new sociotechnical arrangements and associated modes of governance in a model environment under real-world conditions. In this paper, we develop an analytic framework for this distinctive approach to innovation. Our research draws on theories from Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Innovation Studies, as well as in-depth empirical analysis from two case studies - an urban smart energy campus and a rural renewable energy network. Our analysis reveals three characteristic frictions that test beds face: (1) the limits of controlled experimentation due to messy social responses and co-creation activity; (2) a tension between lab-like open-ended experimentation and pressures to demonstrate success; (3) the opposing needs of local socio-cultural specificity and scalability, i.e. the inherent promise of test bed outcomes being generalizable or transferrable because the tested "model society" is presumed to represent a future society at large. These tensions suggest that thinking of test beds as mere technology tests under real-world conditions is insufficient. Rather, test beds both test and re-configure society around a new set of technologies, envisioned futures, and associated modes of governance - occasionally against considerable resistance. By making social order explicitly available for experimentation, test beds tentatively stabilize new socio-technical orders on a local scale in an "asif" mode of adoption and diffusion. Symmetric attention to the simultaneous co-production of new technical and social orders points to new opportunities and challenges for innovation governance in test-bed settings: Rather than mere enablers of technology, test beds could serve as true societal tests for the desirability of certain transformations. This will require rethinking notions of success and failure, planning with a view towards reversibility, and greater scrutiny of how power is distributed within such settings. Likewise, rather than envisioning test beds as low-regulation zones to drive innovation, they could be strategically deployed to co-develop socially desirable governance frameworks in tandem with emerging technologies in real-time.

AB We explore the impact of migrant inventors on patent quality in Europe and the United States between 1990 and 2010. Drawing on a large sample of patent applications filed at the European Patent Office with a corresponding Patent Cooperation Treaty extension, we select inventor teams whose members reside in the countries of interest, but whose nationality may vary. In keeping with the literature, we find that migrant inventors are associated with higher quality patents via increased diversity at the team level, in addition to increased diversity at both the company and local level. This positive relationship with diversity persists after conditioning for the presence of migrants in the team, which is suggestive of cultural, and not merely functional, diversity.

AB While there is a general consensus that young innovative companies (YICs) need special attention by public policy which should aim at alleviating the financial constraints these firms commonly suffer, much less agreement has been reached on the most effective policy instruments reputed to accomplish the task. In this respect, if the scientific debate has very much revolved around the dilemma about the crowding-in or crowding-out effect of public R&D subsidies to firms, there is a dearth of scientific studies which analyse the effectiveness and potential interrelations of different policy instruments which at the same time and in the same institutional context are offered to YICs. By taking advantage of the Italian Startup Act issued in 2012, we analyse, for the first time, the possible existence of interrelationships between firm access to a Government-guaranteed (GG) bank loan programme and fiscal incentives for venture capital (VC) equity investments. Results suggest two important facts. First, the two mechanisms appear to be functional to different typologies of YICs. Second, VC investments significantly reduce the probability to access GG bank loans. Overall, our analysis highlights a sort of "institutional division of labour" between the two measures and depicts what we label as a Task segmentation effect.

AB Despite equal matriculation into life science graduate programs, the gender gap persists for later-stage professional outcomes. To understand this divergence, we examine graduate training and use the competitive NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program to identify high-quality life science students that are awardees and honorable mentions. We use a differencing research design to estimate the relative difference of the R&D award across gender on publication trajectory. The results of the triple difference estimation show a negative effect for women compared to men from the award. We investigate the driver of this effect by examining trends within gender and find a large, positive effect of the award for men but fail to find such evidence for female awardees. Our results indicate different signaling effects across gender even though the funding is meritocratic.

AB In this paper, we explore the impact of a firm's workers' replacements on innovation performance by using rich matched employer-employee panel data for the Veneto region of Italy. We take the well-known resource-based theory of the firm as our departure point, and develop a set of hypotheses which we test empirically with negative binomial regressions. We find that workers' replacements significantly dampen innovation performance, coherently with the idea that they generate losses in the tacit knowledge base of the firm. We also find that workers' replacements are especially detrimental to large and young firms, possibly because large companies benefit comparatively less from 'diaspora' effects and because innovative capabilities in young firms are mostly dependent on specific human capital. Finally, our results show that firms' location in industrial districts significantly mitigates the negative impact of workers' replacements, and that a similar picture emerges when firms are more exposed to knowledge spillovers, particularly of related knowledge.

AB We analyze the impact of accession to the regional patent system established by the European Patent Convention (EPC) on 14 countries that acceded between 2000 and 2008. We look at changes in patenting behavior by domestic and foreign applicants at the national patent offices and the European Patent Office (EPO). We find a strong change in patent filing behavior among foreigners seeking patent protection in the accession states, substituting EPO patents for domestic patents immediately. However, there is no discernible reaction among domestic entities in terms of domestic filings, although we do find some evidence that applicants in accession states increased their propensity to file patents with the EPO post-accession. Inventors in accession countries also increase their patent filings slightly post-accession, both at the EPO and at the national offices.

AB This paper builds new theory and provides supporting evidence to contain the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) - a persistent decision-making error arising from an attitude-based bias against external knowledge. Conceptually, we draw on the 4i framework of organizational learning to develop a novel process perspective on NIHS. This allows us not only to unpack how and where NIHS impedes organizational learning, but also to identify the key requirements for effective NIHS countermeasures. Importantly, countermeasures fall into two categories: those that seek to change the negative attitude directly (direct NIHS countermeasures) and those that seek to attenuate the behavioral impact of negative attitudes without addressing the attitudes as such (indirect NIHS countermeasures). While the evidence base on direct NIHS countermeasures has grown over the last decade, indirect NIHS countermeasures have received little research attention. To address this gap, we adopt a mixed methods research design composed of two complementary empirical studies - the first qualitative and the second quantitative. Study 1 explores the prevalence of distinct NIHS countermeasures in collaborative R&D practice. Based on 32 interviews and three focus group meetings with R&D employees, we find that a broad array of primarily direct NIHS countermeasures is employed in R&D practice. Study 2 addresses the scarcity of scholarly and managerial insights on indirect NIHS countermeasures by testing the effectiveness of perspective taking as a debiasing technique to contain negative attitudes at the level of the individual. Based on quantitative survey data from 565 global R&D projects, it provides empirical evidence not only for the prevalence and negative effects of NIHS on project success as mediated by external knowledge absorption, but also for the effectiveness of perspective taking as an exemplary indirect NIHS countermeasure.

AB When do conversations lead people to generate better ideas? We conducted a field experiment at a startup bootcamp to evaluate the impact of informal conversations on the quality of product ideas generated by participants. Specifically, we examine how the personality of an innovator (openness to experience, capturing creativity) and the personalities of her randomly assigned conversational peers (extroversion, measuring willingness to share information) affects the innovator's ideas. We find that open innovators who spoke with extroverted peers generated significantly better ideas than others at the bootcamp. However, closed individuals produced mediocre ideas regardless with who they spoke, suggesting limited benefits of conversations for these people. More surprisingly, open individuals, who are believed to be inherently creative, produced worse ideas after they spoke with introverted peers, suggesting individual creativity's dependence on external information.

AB We present a case study of an increase in design right filings and concurrent design right litigations in an industry that previously had little experience of design right protection. The motives for and outcomes of filing, and how these changed over time are discussed. We go on to explore the events, which offered the decision makers opportunities to update their beliefs about the scope of design right protection. We find that filing motives changed from specific protection goals to freedom to operate over time. We also find that the actors faced several, but sometimes contradictory, learning opportunities. There are two types of learning relating to the usage of design rights: 1) learning the initial scope of protection and 2) learning the dynamism of scope that results from the growing number of designs in the product category. The evidence suggests that the scope of existing design rights is negatively affected by new design right grants. Our findings highlight the essential role of belief formation and updating in innovation activity and intellectual property rights-based competition. We conclude that uncertain design rights and information asymmetries may have fostered entrepreneurial optimism.

AB Technological imitation may play a crucial role in motivating firms to innovate. However, theoretical predictions and empirical findings on the role of imitation have not yet reached a consensus. One major gap in the previous studies is that the empirical tests are based on samples consisting of only one industry over a short period of time. This study uses a novel measure of industry-level technological imitation proxied by quick citations by competitors to examine the relationship between imitation and innovation. Using US patent data for the period 1977-2005, we find that there are inverted U-shaped relationships between the degree of industry-level technological imitation and industry-level innovation activities and between the degree of industry-level technological imitation and the value of firm-level innovation. Our results suggest that positive externalities from the interactions among firms during the innovation process outweigh the negative effects of free-riding concerns on firms' innovation activities and incentives to innovate up to a high degree of technological imitation, while free-riding concerns outweigh the positive externalities when the level of technological imitation is extremely high. The sector-by-sector analyses show that the relationship between technological imitation and the quantity and market value of innovation are not very different across Pavitt sectors. A comparative analysis on the role of imitation between agglomerated and non-agglomerated industries suggests that the positive effect of a moderate level of imitation and the negative effect of an excessive level of imitation are more pronounced for agglomerated industries. The results suggest that creating innovation clusters, such as Silicon Valley in the United States and Shenzhen City in China, and allowing different innovators to cooperate, imitate and compete with each other would be very effective in promoting corporate innovation. However, an excessively high level of technological imitation is more detrimental for firms in innovation clusters because it lowers those firms' incentives to innovate more radically.

AB Breaking from tradition is necessary for scientific advancement, yet we know little about the factors that encourage scientists to break from tradition in their research, particularly by using methods that are unconventional in their fields. To address this gap, we integrate the sociology of science with insights from organization theory, which delineates the evaluative advantages bestowed on those with elite status and a consistent professional identity. We use a mixed methods design. Bibliometric data on articles using three unconventional methods in sociology-Correspondence Analysis, Qualitative Comparative Analysis, and Sequence Analysis-allow us to identify which types of scholars have a greater hazard of using unconventional methods and the conditions under which these associations hold. Interviews with published, unpublished, and likely users reveal how scholars manage the career risks associated with unconventional method use. We find that scholars who are male and affiliated with top-tier universities, as well as those already committed to an identity consistent with the use of unconventional methods, have a greater hazard of using them in published work, though these associations depend on the extent to which the method diverges epistemologically from conventional methodology and the visibility of its lineage. In addition, we identify five successful (and two unsuccessful) strategies scholars use to manage their use of unconventional methods. Taken together, results from this mixed methods study advance knowledge on scientific practice, extend organization theory, and provides guidance to policymakers and administrators who aim to foster risky, path-breaking research.

AB This study empirically examines the association between the extent of emerging technological ideas in a scientific publication and its future scientific impact measured by number of citations. We analyze metadata of scientific publications in three scientific domains: Nano-Enabled Drug Delivery, Synthetic Biology, and Autonomous Vehicles. By employing a bibliometric indicator for identifying and quantifying emerging technological ideas - as derived terms from the titles and abstracts - we measure the extent to which the publication contains emerging technological ideas in each domain. Then, we statistically estimate the size and statistical significance of the relationship between the publication-level technological emergence score and the normalized number of citations accruing to the publication.
   Our analysis shows that the degree to which a paper contains technologically emerging ideas is positively and strongly associated with its future citation impact in each of the three domains. An additional analysis demonstrates that this relationship holds for citations from other publications, both in the same field as, and in different fields from, the scientific domain of the focal publication. A series of tests for validation further support our argument that the greater the extent to which scientific knowledge (a paper) contains emerging ideas, the bigger its scientific impact. Implications for academic researchers, research policymakers, and firms are discussed.

AB Although organisational mobility has become a crucial part of a researcher's early career phase, its causes and functions in the early career are not yet sufficiently explained. In particular, the field-specific nature of patterns of national and international mobility has been noted but not systematically analysed. Based on case studies and CV data of German early career researchers in plant biology, experimental AMO physics and early modem history we explain differences in mobility patterns by the embeddedness of career decisions in field-specific research practices. In those fields, early career researchers have to develop their first individual research programmes, and enact scripts for their cognitive and organisational careers in order to arrive at such programmes. Enacting the scripts involves utilising organisational positions for specific purposes, which informs the selection of positions and thus shapes patterns of mobility.

AB Performance incentives have become increasingly important in academia. Evidence suggest that they increase not only researchers' effort but also their cheating. We develop a principal-agent framework in which a research institution (principal) aims to reward scientific productivity considering the social benefit of research and the remuneration costs. Researchers (agents) take into account what others are doing. As a consequence, the introduction of performance incentives not only leads to fraudulent behavior in the short run, but may also deteriorate the scientific norm in the long run. In the face of these dynamics, the principal pursues two goals: to increase productivity (effort incentive policy) and to deal with fraud (anti-fraud policy). Several factors determine the optimal mix of policies: economic factors (researchers' cost of providing high or low effort, the societal value of scientific knowledge and the societal costs of scientific misbehavior) and psychological factors (the evolution of norms over time). An important insight of our theory is that when research institutions seek to encourage the production of high quality research, they should also raise the salary for normal research to avoid misconduct.

AB Do low-skilled workers benefit from the growth of high-technology industries in their local economy? Policymakers invest considerable resources in attracting and developing innovative, high-tech industries, but there is relatively little evidence on the distribution of the benefits. This paper investigates the labour market impact of high-tech growth on low and mid-skilled workers, using data on UK local labour markets from 2009-2015. It shows that high-tech industries - either STEM-intensive 'high-tech' or digital economy - have a positive jobs multiplier, with each 10 new high-tech jobs creating around 7 local non-tradeable service jobs, around 6 of which go to low-skilled workers. Employment rates for mid-skilled workers do not increase, but they benefit from higher wages. Yet while low-skilled workers gain from higher employment rates, the jobs are often poorly paid service work, so average wages fall, particularly when increased housing costs are considered.

AB This paper depicts how cultural resonance for novel technologies is constructed as a gradual, interactive process. We adopt a cultural framing perspective and strive to understand how actors assign meaning to the novel technology and determine its appropriateness for the local context. Existing research has largely focused on the strategic and political aspects of field framing processes through depicting conscious framing struggles between protagonist and antagonist actors. In addition to such strategic framing activities, we examine how other sociocultural factors, such as changes in actor positions, interaction between framing activities, and the cultural "repertoire" of frames interact in producing cultural resonance. For our empirical case study, we followed the emerging technological field of solar energy during an intensive period of change. Our study contributes to the growing number of studies that draw attention to the creation of cultural resonance as an interactive multi-actor process by offering in-depth understanding of the multifaceted interactions that constitute the meaning-making process for an emerging field.

A concern with the motivationally-relevant elements of human capital such as employees' job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and willingness to change in the workplace (all of which have been shown to drive innovation), has often been overlooked in economic research and by public policy interventions to date. The paper addresses this gap in two ways: First, by studying firms' human resource systems that can enhance these elements of human capital, and second, using the results of this research as a springboard for a public policy program targeted at elements of human capital that have been ignored by traditional education and training interventions. Using a sample of 1070 employee-managers in Ireland, we apply a series of probit regressions to understand how different human resources systems influence the probability of employee-managers reporting the motivationally-relevant elements of human capital. The research: (1) Finds that respondents in organizations with certain human resource systems are more likely to report motivationally-relevant elements of human capital. Specifically, employee-managers in organizations with proactive work practices and that consult with their employee-managers increase the predicted probability of reporting that they are satisfied with their job, willing to change, and are committed to the organization; (2) Highlights the need to consider the role of policy interventions to support the motivationally-relevant elements of human capital; (3) Proposes a new policy program offer to support the motivationally-relevant elements of human capital in order to increase firms' innovation activity.

AB Divergent time norms between participating organizations constitute a central barrier to cross-sectoral collaborations. We unpack this tension by studying two distinct time-utilization strategies of university and industry in 1845 R&D consortia. The paper shows that collaborating organizations that are subject to divergent time norms can shift the time focus in their favor through the strategic timing of repeated ties. If university-industry consortia are repeated, this repetition tends to take place either at the beginning of the consortium (parallel timing) or at the end (sequential timing) but typically not in the middle. Industry partners seek to "compress time" by working on different consortia in parallel and therefore want to repeat a collaboration early, whereas universities seek to "extend time" through sequential timing of consortia, i.e., repeat a collaboration at the end or after a consortium has ended. We provide a qualitative substantiation of the identified time-utilization strategies and show that both options coexist in multipartner consortia.

ID US PATENT; QUALITY; INNOVATION; INCENTIVES; LITIGATION
AB Patent scope is one of the important aspects in the debates over "patent quality." The purported decrease in patent quality over the last decade or two has supposedly led to granting patents of increased breadth, decreased clarity, and questionable validity (in part due to over-breadth). Such patents allegedly diminish the incentives for innovation due to increased transaction costs in the market for technology, more frequent disputes and litigation, trolling behavior, and breakdowns in bargaining. This paper focuses on the patent examination process at the PTO, highlighting the relationship between patent scope and the patent examination process. We develop and validate two measurements of patent scope: independent claim length and independent claim count. These metrics-in contrast to other measurements of patent scope-can be calculated before and after examination and enable us to provide the first large-scale analysis of trends in patent scope changes during the examination process. Our results show that applications with narrower scope are associated with a higher probability of grant and a shorter and less intense examination period in comparison to applications with broader scope. Further, we find that the examination process itself tends to narrow the scope of patents relative to the scope at filing, and that the changes are more significant when the duration and intensity of examination is increased. We explain our metrics and make our data available in a public use dataset, which we hope will encourage more research in the evaluation of patent scope, patent examination, and patent quality more broadly.

AB This paper studies how productivity-enhancing agricultural technology affects urbanization by provoking structural change. We investigate these issues using a natural experiment in the United States. The results show that technologies which improve crop productivity lead to a less urbanized economy as economic activity relocates from manufacturing and services towards agriculture. The effects are highly persistent and are driven by the technology increasing agricultural labor demand. Our findings highlight the potentially unintended, disruptive force of innovative technologies.

AB Current incentives for publishing in academic journals result in a "winner-take-all" contest-like situation, with significant benefits for publishing research in quality journals. At the same time, empirically, we observe a greater incidence of research misconduct. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the nature and extent of the misconduct problem, to show why it may persist in the absence of conscious remedial action, and to discuss solutions that help lower the likelihood of spurious research escaping undetected. A simple model is constructed to emphasize that there exists the potential for a Prisoners' Dilemma in academia, where scholars engage in misconduct at equilibrium (the Academic Dilemma). The paper then examines why conventional "centralized" regulatory solutions under the current system are not likely to succeed in resolving the problem, analyzes the properties of a decentralized solution utilizing blockchains, and argues that once incentive structures in academia are factored in, a permissioned blockchain may emerge as an effective middle-ground solution for mitigating scientific misconduct. In doing so, the paper highlights the importance of new technologies and recent advancements in Open Science for battling misconduct, and takes stock of the evolving nature of academic publishing.

AB Expertise in digital technologies is necessary, but rarely sufficient to generate digital innovation. The purpose of this paper is to explore how specialists rooted in digital and analog knowledge domains engage in cross-domain collaboration to jointly create digital innovation. Our analysis cross-examines the literature on knowledge integration and coordination by examining the role of boundary-spanning tools in fusing divergent types of knowledge. The empirical setting for our study is the development of digital serious games, a novel breed of digital learning products whose creation involves a wide range of gaming/digital and learning/analog expertise. Drawing on an in-depth qualitative study, we find that boundary-spanning tools such as prototypes, mockups, and whiteboards serve as important knowledge bridges buttressing the overall innovation process, enabling diverse experts to increasingly align and integrate their divergent thought worlds and knowledge domains. Furthermore, we find that the alternative interplay among digital and non-digital tools supports the gradual transformation of digital and analog expertise into a novel digital format. Taken together, our results explicate how boundary-spanning tools facilitate collaborative work among specialists rooted in diverse digital and non-digital knowledge domains. Our findings contribute to the literature on knowledge integration and coordination in cross-domain collaboration and digital innovation.

AB We explore the effect of political uncertainty on innovation. In particular, we examine the differential effects of two sources of uncertainty - leaders' education levels and political regimes (i.e., presidential vs. parliamentary) - on patent applications. We posit that firms react to political uncertainty caused by the unexpected departure of a national leader by investing in patents as growth options. The empirical design analyzes a panel with information from over 62 million patent applications at the aggregated applicant level. Results show that leaders' unexpected departures cause, on average, increases of approximately 9% in the aggregate growth of patent applications. We also find that the leader's level of education and the country's political regime system have significant effects on the relationship between political uncertainty and innovation. The difference between leaders with high and low levels of education accounts for 21% of the change in the growth of patent applications. Further, the effect of political uncertainty on innovation is amplified in presidential systems, which grant leaders more power and make electoral transitions less predictable. The differences between presidential and parliamentary systems account for approximately 16% of the change in the growth of patent applications. As a robustness check, we utilized a subsample of more than 170,000 firms with local and foreign patent applications, as well as a panel of over 5700 government non-profits, universities, and hospitals with local patent applications. Consistent with our theory, the former react to political uncertainty by investing in patents, while the latter remain unaffected. We contribute by showing the theoretical mechanisms linking leader and regime characteristics with patent applications.

AB Since its emergence in the 1980s, the concept of "Innovation Systems" (IS) has inspired research and shaped discussions in academia and policy alike, leading to a cascading development of approaches and extensions at various analytic levels. IS research has expanded far beyond its initial focus by generating new knowledge within but also attracting increased attention from adjacent fields. As a result, the broad understanding of IS and its diversity in applications has resulted in blurry boundaries of the field, making its contemporary delineation, synthesis, and assessment of its progress challenging. Using a combination of data-driven techniques from bibliometrics, natural language processing, and network analysis, this paper maps and analyzes the structure of knowledge production and the process of knowledge integration in current research. We find an overall growing tendency toward increasing diversity in the knowledge bases from which the field draws, accompanied by a decreasing coherence of collective research efforts. We point to the crucial role of institutions and academic entrepreneurs in shaping these developments in interdisciplinary and diverse fields, illustrating this by the role of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

AB The transfer of scientific material and data, which are scientific inputs, is fundamental to knowledge creation dynamics. This transfer is being controlled, more and more, by the use of Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs). Therefore, the effect of MTAs on the dynamic of knowledge creation is an important concern. The aim of this research is to characterise the restrictions imposed by MTAs, and their determinants. We consider MTA diversity based on a comprehensive analysis of the clauses included in 171 MTAs signed by two French universities. We show that the clauses included in MTAs depend on several factors such as kind of material involved, research field, patenting and collection of material. We find that the presence of an industry actor is not associated to more restrictions on publication and intellectual property. We propose a typology of MTAs corresponding to different transfer situations. We discuss the role of MTAs as collaborative tools and the influence of the legal, scientific, political and organisational context.

AB We explore the contention that the seminal US National Academies consensus report, How People Learn (HPL), played a major role in bridging the flow of knowledge from Cognitive Science to Education. Our paper yielded four important results: First, HPL is, on a number of bibliometric measures, an unusually interdisciplinary work. Focusing on the fields of particular interest here, our citation analysis shows the Education, Cognitive Science, and Border field (e.g., Educational Psychology, Learning Sciences, and Learning Technology and Human-Computer Interaction) literatures all to have been major influences on it. Second, we found HPL to be unusually highly cited - and by publications from an unusually diverse set of disciplines. Beyond Education, Cognitive Science, and Border field publications, HPL was also relatively highly cited by publications in Medical/Healthrelated, Engineering, and other Discipline-Based Education Research fields. Third, undermining the claim that HPL served as a gateway to the Cognitive Science literature, we found Education articles citing HPL not to be more likely to have Cognitive Science as a major influence than are Education articles more generally, as indicated by their cited references. Finally, the Education publications that cited HPL were far more likely to refer to concepts in HPL that were already prevalent in the Education literature rather than to concepts from Cognitive Science. Conversely, the Cognitive Science publications that cited HPL were more apt to refer to concepts already in the Cognitive Science literature. Taken together, these results are a caution that, even for a highly regarded multidisciplinary work cited widely by publications from multiple disciplines, its direct influence could be largely disciplinary. Implications for the policy goals of fostering interdisciplinary research and the role of National Academies consensus reports are discussed.

AB This paper analyses Amsterdam's Startup-in-Residence (SiR) programme as new type of policy to engage startups in the development of urban innovation through a challenge-based public procurement of innovation (PPI) process. The programme is being mimicked by other cities and government agencies, but so far there has not been a rigorous, theoretically-informed analysis of the approach. In this paper, we specify and focus on the role of city-based, public-affiliated intermediaries as initiators, moderators and influencers of conversations between startups and the local government. The main contribution of SiR as a PPI intermediation programme has been to launch new types of fruitful conversations on several levels, that lead to institutional innovations rather than direct solutions for urban problems or startup development. In this sense, SiR fulfils a role inquiring and ascribing urban challenges with values and notions of "worth" that preceded and shaped innovation directions. We also suggest that engaging startups is effective for only a limited bandwidth urban challenges; different types of intermediation are required to foster collaborative innovation in more complex settings.

AB This study adds to the product innovation literature by emphasizing the important yet understudied role of price distribution in shaping product demography (i.e. new product introductions and exits). While prior research has focused on market niches in the technological and geographic spaces in order to explain product demography, price space has received very limited attention despite the important role of price in the market. We posit that product dynamics are largely shaped by the existing price distribution. More specifically, we argue that local density in price space determines both the likelihood of existing products exiting the market and the rate of new products entering it. Analyzing product exit and entry in the U.S. workstation industry from 1980 to 1996, we find that while price density increases an existing product's exit rate, new products are also more likely to enter the niches where the price density is high. We also draw attention to internal price density within multiproduct firms, analyzing a product's price distance from the other products launched by the same firm. We find that this type of internal price density decreases both existing products' exit rate and new products' entry likelihood. Our emphasis on price space contributes to the literature on product innovation and demography.

AB This paper examines a largely unexplored channel of the effects of offshore production on onshore (domestic) innovation performance. We combine a comprehensive dataset mapping the global operations of Japanese multinational firms with patent statistics to measure innovation. The study finds that increased offshore production have little effects on onshore innovation performance once properly correcting a simultaneity bias. Furthermore, we find some weak evidence of increased offshore production downgrades the quality of innovation, measured by citations. Consistent with other studies, we find that an increase in overseas R&D is the main driver of innovation creation for multinational firms.

AB The domain of transition studies has been drawing more and more scholarly attention and, as a result, its body of knowledge is rapidly growing. This raises new challenges as well as opportunities, not the least regarding the methodological and philosophical underpinnings of research in this domain. In this respect, transition research, as a relatively young field of inquiry, has been little concerned with methodological investigation and reflection. We propose a framework that enables this reflection: the so-called 'transition research onion'. Subsequently, we utilize this framework to systematically assess 217 peer-reviewed papers in the field of transition studies, to distill key methodological patterns and trends of the field. The findings suggest that the methodology of transition studies, in terms of depth and diversity, is underdeveloped. These insights serve to guide future research on transition processes.

ID AL; KINETICS; TI
AB The Al3Ti intermetallic compound (IMC) layer growth kinetics at Al-Ti interface was investigated. Surprisingly an abnormal effect of temperature was observed with a thicker IMC layer formed at lower annealing temperature due to the much faster Al3Ti grain coarsening at a higher temperature, the IMC layer growth at 630 degrees C became slower than that at 600 degrees C after a certain annealing time. The quantitative influence of grain size on effective diffusion coefficient was analysed. Calculations showed that the lattice diffusion makes little contribution to the effective diffusion coefficient. Grain boundary diffusion, therefore, dominates for all the annealing conditions studied. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In conventional electrospinning (e-spinning) process, the curing mechanism can be attributed to the volatilization of solvent or the melt cooling of the jets, which were merely physical processes. To develop novel e-spinning curing mechanism, we propose a conjugate e-spinning one, in which the e-spinning precursors, solution A containing some active monomers, oxidant and solution B containing reductant, are loaded into two different syringes connected with opposite high voltage supplier, respectively. The opposite charged jets attract each other and then meet when flying from spinneret tip to collector. The redox reaction occurs when two jets meet and radicals are produced in situ which can initiate polymerization of active monomers. Then the conjugate jets solidify into fibers under reaction curing mechanism. The new method may give a new approach to produce composite functional fibers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, monoethanolamine(MEA) content effects on crystal phase, chemical composition, morphology for Cu2CoSnS4 (CCTS) nanoparticles synthesized via hydrothermal process are intensively studied by using XRD, Raman, pH monitoring, and others. For two-terminal photodetectors based on CCTS nanoparticles, hybrid annealing process (i.e., vacuum annealing followed by UV irradiation) is more effective to improve electrical and photo-responsive properties, as compared with only either UV irradiation or vacuum annealing. Two-terminal CCTS photodetectors based on hybrid annealing yield the improved contact resistance (R-c = 6.49 +/- 1.8 k Omega), sheet resistance (R-sh = 2.19 +/- 0.32 k Omega/cm), photosensitivity (S-ph = 37%), photo responsivity (R-ph = 1.60 A/W), detectivity (D-ph = 2.62 x 10(10) Jones), at least better than individual annealing condition as above. More importantly, the hybrid annealing process is potentially beneficial for high performance, low temperature CCTS device implementation for envisioned flexible electronic applications.

Chitosan is used to increase the coordination between the ions along with chelate agent glutaraldehyde, used to form the gel in sol-gel technique. Calcination process was also applied, with temperature of 1100 degrees C, 10 degrees C/min step for 10 h, to eliminate organic composes and obtain NiFe2O4 with particles over 300 nm diameter. The obtained efficiency results show that A03 (120 g/L) sample has better final efficiency between the proposed concentrations, reaching a 57.39% value with 95.86% purity, estimated by XRD and EDS. SEM was also performed, and confirmed size distribution based on XRD results, presenting homogeneous morphology along with narrow particle size distribution. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The gelation time, swelling behaviors, mechanical properties and antibacterial ability of hydrogels were evaluated. Results showed that shorter gelation time, lower swelling ratio and higher storage modulus were observed in the double crosslinking hydrogels with the same thiol/vinyl molar ratios, due to the introduction of chitosan/beta-glycerophosphate based physical cross-linked network into the initial chemical cross-linked gelling system.

AB The SrZnO2: 0.02 Eu3+ phosphors were prepared by conventional solid-state reactions in O-2, air, N-2 and Ar, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses show that the concentration of oxygen defects in samples change obviously under different atmospheres. From the data collected by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and the fluorescence spectra, it is found that Vo and oxygen interstitials can diminish band gaps of samples, promoting an increase in photoluminescence intensities of samples on the based of host-sensitized luminescence effect, in which the effect of oxygen vacancies is stronger than that of oxygen interstitials. The mechanism of band gap narrowing has been explained in detail. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Yarn-ball-shaped P2-Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 nanofiber cathode material is synthesized by a magnetic-assisted electrospinning method. Based on the electrospinning method, an electromagnetic-field is performed to keep the nanofibers rotating to form the yarn-ball-like architecture. XRD result indicates that the sample is a pure P2-type Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 phase with good crystallization. SEM results show that the diameter of the balls is about 10-50 mu m, and the balls are composed of nanofibers with a diameter of 200-400 nm. This special architecture is beneficial to increase the Na+ diffusion speed and tap-density of nanofiber material. Electrochemical tests show that the sample has a high discharge specific capacity of 218.6 mAh g(1) at 0.1 C rate, and exhibits good rate capability and excellent cycling performance.

AB Herein, the novel ficus-iacertiolia fruit-derived porous graphene-like nanosheets (PGNSs) with rich active functional groups were synthesized via a high-efficient and low-cost one-step carbonization technique for H2O2 biosensor. Target electrode materials have promising porous structures with a large specific surface area (S-a) of 480.67 m(2) g(1). The modified glassy carbon electrode (PGNSs/GCE) was constructed and exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity, showing a high-efficiency detection of H2O2, high sensitivity of 6.17 mu A mM(1) cm(2), a low detection limit of as low as 2.75 mu M and a wide linear range of 0.2-19 mM. Thus, this work demonstrates fundamental insights for the porous and active functional groups on electrodes, and provides a facile route to fabricate a highly sensitive H2O2 sensor for practical aspergillus flavus diagnosis.

AB Selective laser melting (SLM), as a rapidly developed layer-by-layer 3D printing technology, has been demonstrated that it can be used for additive manufacturing of multi-materials. In this work, TiB2/Ti6Al4V multi-materials were manufactured by SLM. The results showed that interfacial microstructures consisting of un-melted TiB2 powders, columnar TiB crystals, and acicular TiB crystals were formed in the molten pool. Meanwhile, a variation nanohardness was developed with chemical compositions at the interfacial regions, owing to an in-situ reaction of Ti and TiB2. The first-principle calculations were used to reveal the axial growth of TiB crystals as well as the different hardness of this system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanocluster-like Pt nanoparticles/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite catalyst (NC-PtNPs/RGO) was synthesized through a novel one-step process of chemical reduction-assisted hydrothermal reaction by using formic acid as reducing agent. The crystallinity, morphology and composition of the NC-PtNPs/RGO catalysts were extensively characterized. The as-prepared NC-PtNPs/RGO catalysts exhibited higher electro-catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation than carbon black (CB)/PtNPs catalyst and could be ascribed to the high dispersion of NC-Pt NPs with large electrochemical surface area, release more exposure of active sites by NC-PtNPs structure and synergy effect of RGO.

AB The mechanical properties and microstructure evolution of a precipitation-strengthened refractory high-entropy alloy, HfNbTaTiZr, with equiaxed grains are reported. The as-cast alloy shows a high yield strength of 356 MPa at 1200 degrees C, and 1597 MPa with good ductility at room temperature. The enhancement in strength is attributed to precipitation strengthening. Afterwards, microstructure evolution was investigated under several annealing treatment conditions: 1000 degrees C for 24 h, 1200 degrees C for 24 h, 1400 degrees C for 24 h, and 1450 degrees C for 168 h. The hcp-1 phase appears at 1000 degrees C and gradually dissolves up to 1200 degrees C. When the temperature rises to 1400 degrees C, the hcp-1 phase disappears, and fine nanoprecipitates begin to form. After annealing at 1450 degrees C for one week, however, this alloy exhibits phase decomposition. With the formation of two kinds of new fcc phase, fine nanoprecipitate only remains in bcc matrix, and another new hcp-2 phase forms in the grain. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper an easy and mild solution-processed method is introduced to prepare extra sodium (Na) doped Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) films on Mo-coated soda-lime glasses. Through this method, the Na-doping concentration can be adjusted at the range from 3.9% to 5.4% continuously. By extra Na doping through solution process, the grain size of CZTS particles was enlarged apparently without introducing any impurity phase. More excitingly, the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum indicates that high Na-doping concentration has the strong suppression ability on the band-gap recombination of CZTS films. The carrier lifetime is promoted from 2.1 ns to 2.83 ns. CZTS thin film solar cell with 4.8% Na-doping concentration shows the best performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results display that titania particles prepared exhibit enhanced optical absorption from 400 to 450 nm. Titania particles prepared possess higher separation rate of the photo-induced charge pairs than P25 (TiO2) from 400 to 450 nm. The photocatalytic performance of titania particles prepared toward decolorization of rhodamine B aqueous solution was investigated. The results show that the photocatalytic performance of titania particles priors to that of P25. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon nanosheets are spontaneously produced from the decomposition of pyrophoric lithium dialkylamides in air. The heat released from the exothermic decomposition of the precursors is further utilized to produce mechanical work through a Peltier thermoelectric device. The nanosheets are amorphous containing O/N structural heteroatoms and exhibit specific surface area values roughly in the range 100-150 m(2) g(-1). Surface decoration of the sheets with gold nanoparticles results in functional nanohybrids that seem to be conceptually similar to those of gold-graphene nanohybrids and could be used for further catalytic applications.

AB Lead-based glasses doped with Dy3+ ions as potential candidates to generate white luminescence were studied. The ternary glass systems PbO-Ga2O3-X (where X = TeO2, GeO2, SiO2, P2O5, B2O3) were synthesized. The luminescence spectra for obtained glasses were registered and were analyzed in detail. Moreover, from the emission spectra the Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates (x, y) and the correlated color temperatures (CCT) were calculated. It was observed that the values of ratio of yellow-to-blue luminescence (Y/B) defined as I(F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2))/I(F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2)) decrease from 1.70 to 1.12 in systems with reduction of covalent character for heavy metal oxides. Also, the color parameters change when glass composition is modified. The obtained results indicate that the lead-based glasses doped with Dy3+ ions exhibit nearly cool white emission and the values of CCT increase from 4448 K (PbO-Ga2O3-TeO2) to 5936 K (PbO-Ga2O3-B2O3).

AB Red, green and blue upconversion emissions has been reported under the 808 nm excitation in Ln(3+) (Ln(3+) = Er3+, Tm3+, Yb3+) doped YNbO4 (YNO) phosphors prepared by the solid-state reaction method. Warm-white upconversion emission with CIE color coordinates equal to x = 0.34 and y = 0.35 was obtained in the YNO: 0.5% Er(3+)2.0% Tm(3+)15%Yb3+ composition under 9 W/cm(2). This result was possible due to efficient synergistic process between Er3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+ ions. The significant improvement of red emission in the tri-doped sample was explained by the energy-transfer between Er3+ and Tm3+ ions. The upconversion mechanism and population processes are discussed in details. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, thermal stability of Sn-0.7Cu-10B-xNi/Co (SCB-xNi/Co, x = 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15, in wt.%) interface during multiple reflows was investigated. Both (Ni, Co)Sn-3 and (Cu, Ni)(6)Sn-5 phases were formed at the SCB-xNi/Co interface after the initial reflow. With the increase of reflow number, the thermal stability of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) layer at high temperature was significantly different. The content of Ni atoms determined the thermal stability of IMCs layer in the interface reaction process. At the IMCs layer at the SCB-0.15Ni/Co interface, Ni atoms were enriched excessively, but they were present in a dispersive distribution at SCB-0.05Ni/Co and SCB-0.10Ni/Co interfaces. Ni atoms occupied sublattice sites of Co atoms in CoSn3 phase, which could improve the high-temperature stability of IMCs layer, so the IMCs layer had the strongest thermal stability at the SCB-0.15Ni/Co interface.

After chemical reduction and high-temperature sulfurization, a graphene-WS2 composite nanofilm with microcavities was obtained. When evaluated as an anode material in a lithium-ion battery, the graphene-WS2 sample (precursor graphene oxide/WS2 mass ratio of 1:4) exhibited high initial specific capacity (similar to 980 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), optimal cycling performance (similar to 450 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1)), and superior rate capability (similar to 300 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)). The graphene/WS2 mass ratio influenced the contact between WS2 and graphene and the porous nanofilm structure facilitated the kinetics of lithium-ion diffusion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The CoCrNi/SiC whisker (SiCw) composite was developed by a combination method of coating and spark plasma sintering (SPS). SiCw could be evenly distributed on the CoCrNi gas-atomized powder after coating and an obvious grain refinement could be observed in the microstructure of composite after sintering. Meanwhile, the CoCrNi/SiCw composite with a trace of in-situ M23C6 phases showed superior mechanical properties: addition of 2 wt% SiCw led to an increase in the yield strength (YS) and hardness from 352 MPa and 159 HV to 595 MPa and 422 HV respectively, compared with the CoCrNi MEA. The improved strength is attributed to synergistic effects of Orowan strengthening, grain refinement and thermal mismatch mechanism. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High crystalline and single phase iron-doped niobate ceramic with Tetragonal Tungsten Bronze TTB-type structure, stoichiometry KSr2(FeNb4) O15-delta, was prepared by conventional technique using high energy milling. Both techniques Rietveld Method and Mossbauer spectroscopy showed that Fe3+ cations occupy two different octahedral sites in the TTB structure on the niobium octahedral sites, termed as Nb(1) and Nb(2). At room temperature, the dielectric permittivity value of the KSr2(FeNb4) O15-delta is two times higher than the permittivity values of the KSr2Nb5O15. The suppression with extinction of ferro-para phase-transition occurs as function of break-down of polar characteristic. New non-polar space group development stemming from solid solution formation is discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The electric-field control of resistance change (DR/R) and magnetic properties has been investigated in the LaMnO3(LMO)/0.71Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-0.29PbTiO(3) (PMN-PT)(0 1 1) heterostructure. When the unipolar electric field (E) increases beyond the coercive field of PMN-PT, the DR/R vs E curve transforms from a loop-like behavior to a butterfly-like one. The electric-field-induced non-linear strain effect in the PMN-PT substrate realizes the modulation between low and high resistance states at room temperature. Moreover, different freezing temperatures of the LMO film are observed as the PMN-PT substrate is in the fully negative (P-r(-)) and partially positive (P-r(//)) polarization states. The observation of less magnetization for P-r(//) state than that for P-r(-) state indicates that the in-plane tensile strain is beneficial to the Jahn-Teller distortion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a novel high length-diameter ratio NiO nanorods decorated with uniform ZnO nanoparticles was synthesized via a facile one-step hydrothermal process. It was a surprise to find that the NiO/ZnO nanorods heterostructure based sensor demonstrated much more excellent ethanol gas sensing properties than that of undoped NiO nanorods. This enhancement of sensing properties may be attributed to their synergetic effect as well as the heterojunction at interface between the NiO nanorods and ZnO nanoparticles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The defects in p-type 4H-, 6H- and 3C-SiC epilayers grown on SiC substrates were characterised. The surface roughness after etching and the full width at half maximum of the X-ray rocking curves of the epilayers revealed more dislocations in those grown on the on-axis substrates than on the off-axis ones; the deep levels were also significant for the epilayers grown on the on-axis substrates. These results suggested that the dislocations, double-positioning boundaries and stacking faults in the SiC epilayers grown on on-axis substrates induced deep levels in the bandgap. Step-flow epitaxy on off-angle substrates is the best method for p-type SiC epilayers fabrication, and thus we need novel growth technique to obtain high quality 3C-SiC epilayers.

The compressive mechanical behavior and the related mechanism of the new double-V structures have been analyzed. It is shown that the new structure shows a gradual hardening characteristic in the "plateau stage" and exhibits tunable auxetic behavior with varied structure parameters, i.e., the auxetic behavior becomes more pronounced as theta(1) and theta(2) decrease.

AB In the steel industry, the fabrication of sintered products includes the use of graphite as an alloying element and lubricant. This study explores the idea that a sintered alloy with increased properties can be produced substituting graphite by carbon nanotubes. Also, the microstructural characteristics of an equiatomic alloy CrFeMnNiTi were compared with an austenitic 321 stainless-steel; which at present, has a vital role in the food industry. Results showed that the equiatomic alloy was composed mainly by austenite and Ti-rich phases, growth rate and porosity of samples were reduced with the graphite substitution. On this way, carbon nanotubes addition and modification of the chemical composition of the alloy represented viable routes to obtain new alloys with enhanced properties to replace conventional steels.

AB The effect of impact pressure on energy release behavior of high-energy insensitive particle reinforced composites is investigated. The results show that as the impact pressure reaches 5.39 GPa, the high-energy insensitive particulate reinforced composites initiation occurs for the first time. With the increase of the impact pressure, the gas pressure inside the high-pressure explosion chamber increases gradually until the impact pressure increases to 11.95 GPa.

AB We reported a simple method to fabricate SERS active substrate composed of Ag NPs where ZnO Nrds was chosen as the probe molecule. Ag NPs and ZnO Nrds were synthesized separately by polyol and hydrothermal method, respectively. Subsequently, we have deposited a roughened surface made of Ag NPs on glass by spin coating. Morphology, phase composition and optical properties of Ag NPs and ZnO Nrds are characterized by Transition Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction XRD, Raman and Uv-vis Spectroscopy. An amplification of the SERS intensity by an order more than 4.5 times was observed. The responses demonstrated the capability of Ag NPs SERS substrate to be used for detection of heavy metal oxide compounds. Due to the formation of interfacial electric field between Ag NPs and ZnO Nrds, the mechanism of SERS enhancement was discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work is to understand the relationship among average grain size, dimple size and tensile properties of 316L stainless steel via directly experimental results. We have successfully prepared samples with the average grain size from a few microns to tens of microns through cold rolling and annealing processes. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed to confirm the Hall-Petch relationship between the grain size and yield strength. In order to uncover the grain size dependence of ductility, the fracture morphologies in details were observed. It revealed that the dimple size is positively related to the value of D-1/2 (D is the average diameter of grain size). A larger grain size was believed to result in a larger dimple so as to achieve a higher ductility (uniform elongation). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Al2O3 nanostructured as a low-cost photocatalyst was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal technique. EDX and FE-SEM analyses were utilized to check structural features and chemical composition respectively. As a result, changing PH has a powerful effect on the morphological properties of the synthesized Al2O3 to nanoparticles and nanowires. Photocatalytic activity of nanostructured Al2O3 was evaluated using sunlight and diode laser with different exposure times for pH = 7 and pH = 9. The results show that nanostructured Al2O3 is an efficient catalytic for the removal of pollutant. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In inertial confined fusion (ICF) experiments, hollow nanoporous gold (NPG) tube serves as the desirable component for hohlraum because of its significant radiation opacity. Nevertheless, preparing NPG tube by micromachining is complicated and unfriendly for practical application. Here, a near-net shaping technology, including an alternative electroplating, a heat treatment process and a two-step corrosion method, is developed to fabricate NPG tube without complicated micromachining process. The heat treatment parameters are optimized, and the phase evolution from electroplated coating to NPG tube is investigated in detail. Furthermore, it is also studied here that the formation mechanism of the microstructure. A hollow nanoporous gold tube with fine and uniform pore size (similar to 35 nm) is successfully obtained. The length, inner diameter and thickness of the NPG tube are 10 mm, 1 mm and 90 mu m, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Developing facile strategies to synthesize transition metal oxides and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) hybrid materials is important for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) but also challenging. Herein, unique one-dimensional multicomponent MoO2@CoO-CoMoO4-NC hybrid nanorods have been successfully synthesized. Benefiting from the unique morphology, structure and components, the MoO2@CoO-CoMoO4-NC hybrid nanorods exhibit a high reversible discharge capacity of 1164.0 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) for 80 cycles, good rate performance (394.5 mA h g(-1) at 4000 mA g(-1)) and cycling stability (688.8 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1) for 350 cycles). It is believed that the MoO2@CoO-CoMoO4-NC hybrid nanorods could be very promising anode materials for LIBs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amine-functionalized carbon nanoparticles (NH2-CNPs) were synthesized by one-step hydrothermal reaction using the polyethylenimine (PEI) polymer as precursor. CNPs which present an intense photoluminescence under UV light (300-400 nm), were dispersed in graphene oxide (GO), generating a novel complex carbon-based material. The structure of the nanocomposite and its physiochemical properties were investigated using various analytical techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of C-N bonds and -NH2 groups attesting the successful incorporation of the functionalized carbon nanoparticles into the graphene oxide nanosheets. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the homogeneous dispersion of NH2-CNPs, which their size ranges between 10 and 20 nm, in GO sheets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel hexagonal prism Copper (II) metal organic framework (Cu-BTC) was first synthesized by using a facile unipolar pulse electropolymerization method. It has been found that the morphology of Cu-BTC crystals can be changed from octahedron to hexagonal prism with the increase of pulse cycles. The XRD pattern confirms that the crystal structure of Cu-BTC was slightly affected by the change of the crystal morphology. Furthermore, the growth mechanism of hexagonal prism Cu-BTC crystals was proposed. This method provides valuable guidelines for the design of other MOFs and opens up new opportunities for exploring their application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The typical absorber layer thickness to the solar cells is 3-5 mu m as well as the controlled copper doping is very promising for CdTe thin films and concerned solar cell devices to achieve low resistivity and ohmic contacts as well. In this study, we report the physical properties of e-beam developed CdTe:Cu films (0.55 mu m) with an impact of thermal annealing. The structural study revealed that films have preferential growth along (1 1 1) zinc blende cubic plane, and crystallinity improved with annealing. The electrical current is found to increase with voltage and decrease with annealing which revealed nearly ohmic behavior and shrinking in electrical conductivity. Films surface have deep valley and hill like topography while higher roughness is observed for 300 degrees C annealed films. Transmission spectra showed lower transmittance in the whole visible region and optimum band gap (1.58 eV) is estimated for 300 degrees C annealed films. Our study exposes that 300 degrees C annealed CdTe:Cu films have a preference to become a suitable candidate for absorber layer functions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Brazing of Cubic boron nitride (cBN) to tungsten carbide (WC-Co) for cutting tool application was successfully conducted by microwave hybrid heating by way of applying a paste of Ag-Cu-In-Ti alloy. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the joint cross-section show good metallurgical joint. Energy dispersive spectroscopy study reveals the diffusion of Ti towards cBN which leads to form Ti-N and Ti-B compounds. This improves the metallurgical compatibility with the Ag-In-Cu interlayer and thereby improving its wettability. XRD analysis confirm the formation of TiN, TiB2, TiB. The shear strength of the joint formed is high, such that the braze fails away from the joint, towards cBN. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To deal with the pollution of lead ions (Pb2+) in water, sodium alginate (SA) thick films prepared with a sol-gel preparation method were modified with sulfhydryl, addressing the issue (lead-ion pollution) with the optimized adsorbing capacity (416.1 mg.g(-1)), which can far surpass the pure SA films (222.0 mg.g(-1)). Through adsorption kinetics analysis and thermodynamic analysis, we find that the adsorption process is an exothermic process that follows both physical adsorption (pseudo-first-order) and chemisorption (pseudo-second-order). More surprisingly, the films can adsorb lead ions in weak acid environments and at room temperature, giving rise to the possibility of addressing related issues under universal conditions.

AB Nanowire-net and nanosheet-structured cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)) was prepared directly on a fluorinedoped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate using aqueous solutions of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (10 mM) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT, 2-30 mM), synthesized at 60 degrees C. With increasing HMT amount, the morphology changed from nanowire-net to nanosheet, resulting from the promotion of growth under sufficient OH- ions provided by the HMT. The binder-free Co(OH)(2) sample prepared with 30 mM HMT showed a good areal specific capacitance of similar to 60 mF/cm(2) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s, as well as excellent capacity retention (similar to 84% over 5000 cycles). The proposed facile method allows the morphological engineering of Co(OH)(2) nanostructures with superior electrochemical performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the Mg-10Li-3Al-3Zn-0.25Si alloy undergoing multiple thermal cycles between high and low temperatures were explored in this study. The results showed that the thermal cycling process between high and low temperatures can lead to beta-Li grain refinement and solid solution transformation of MgLiZn in the Mg-10Li-3Al-3Zn-0.25Si alloy. Furthermore, the strength of the Mg-10Li-3Al-3Zn-0.25Si alloy was reduced by 6-8%, while the elongation of the alloy was enhanced by approximately 65% after the thermal cycling process.

AB Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have excellent optical properties such as high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) and high colour purity, and thus show promising application prospects in photoelectric devices. However, the poor stability of PQDs (especially red-emissive PQDs) greatly limits their applications. Herein, we synthesized CsPbBr3-xIx/ZnSe heterostructures via in-situ formation of ZnSe QDs in the red-emissive CsPbBr3-xIx PQDs, which maintains the high PL QY (similar to 70%) but greatly enhances the stability of PQDs. Subsequently, we utilized the red-emissive CsPbBr3-xIx/ZnSe heterostructures and green-emissive CsPbBr3 PQDs as the light conversion materials to fabricate a QD film, which was then applied in backlight display with ultra-wide colour gamut up to NTSC 125%.

AB Mo-Cu alloy films with different thicknesses were deposited on flexible polyimide substrates by magnetron sputtering and, optionally, in situ vacuum annealing. Compositions and surface morphologies of the films were characterized by FESEM and EDS. And this revealed annealing had an important effect on the microstructure of the alloy films. During annealing, a large number of uniformly distributed copper (Cu) particles formed spontaneously on the Mo-Cu alloy films surface, with their sizes, shapes and number closely related to Cu content, annealing temperature, and film thicknesses. Thus, we demonstrated a new way for preparing Cu/Mo-Cu alloy film with large specific surface area which can be used as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Their morphology and element composition were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, BET and XPS. Gas sensing performance results show that the Ag doped Zn2SnO4/SnO2 sensor exhibited better performance to 50 ppm formaldehyde including higher response (60) and lower optimum operating temperature (140 degrees C) compared with pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2. The lowest detectable concentration is 5 ppm. It demonstrated that Ag doping effectively improves the gas sensitive properties to detect low concentration of formaldehyde gas. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The Se dopants are found to increase the crystallization temperature and reduce the grain size. And the excess Ge atoms play a vital role in promoting the thermal stability of doped alloy. The reversible memory switching capability evidences that the GSST alloy is a potential reliable phase-change material in storage application for automobile systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID THIN-FILMS; DATA RETENTION; CRYSTALLIZATION; CANDIDATE
AB We comprehensively study the influences of Ti doping on the phase change properties of Sn2Se3 film through experiments and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Both the crystallization temperature and the activation energy of Sn2Se3 increase significantly by introducing Ti atoms, indicating enhanced thermal stability. Based on the results of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with theoretical calculations, we assume that Ti atoms tend to form covalent bonds with Se in amorphous Sn2Se3. Because of the stronger bond energy of Ti-Se and the change of the bonding environment around Ti atoms, it is more difficult to rearrange the atoms to form long-range order, thus giving rise to the thermal stability of the amorphous phase. Our work shows that Ti doped Sn2Se3 is a promising candidate for the application of next generation non-volatile memory. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite recent advances in preparing hydrogels, their application is mainly limited due to the poor mechanical properties or the high risk of inflammatory response. Therefore, in this study a fully defined in situ hydrogelation system is developed based on green-chemistry in which alginate dialdehyde (ADA) was coupled to an isocyanate-free urethane derivative. FTIR analysis along with (HNMR)-H-1 confirmed hydrogel formation. Improved thermal stability of the hydrogel was an indication of hydrogen bonding at various sites. The microgels possessed the mean diameter of 4 microns, reasonable gelation time and suitable biocompatibility which made them prospective candidates for various fields of biomedicine.

AB The preparation of Janus nanofibers by electrospinning using a side-by-side needle is a well-known method. In this study, a new method was developed that utilized the phase separation phenomenon in a mixed solution of polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to prepare Janus nanocomposites via electrospinning. The morphology, hydrophilicity, and pore size distribution of the PCL/PVP Janus nanofibers were investigated. The results showed that the best effect was obtained when the PCL to PVP mass ratio was 1:1. In order to further verify that the method could successfully prepare nanofibers with the Janus structure, Ag nanoparticles (AgNP) were loaded on the nanofibers, which gave them an antibacterial property. The distribution of the AgNP on the nanofibers could be observed using transmission electron microscopy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To realize simultaneous removal of oils and water-miscible dyes from emulsions, a versatile carbon/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) aerogel with high compressibility and underwater superoleophobicity was fabricated by in situ pyrolysis of urea on the surfaces of cotton fibers. The surfaces were densely covered with a layer of g-C3N4 nanoparticles, leading to the aerogel with underwater superoleophobicity towards oils and organic solvents. The aerogel can be applied for wastewater purification with high flux and removal efficiency only driven by gravity. Various emulsions, dye wastewaters, and even their mixtures can be effectively purified by the aerogel with excellent recyclability. The prepared carbon/g-C3N4 aerogel is believed to have great potential for practical wastewater purification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports a facile preparation of re-configurable shape memory polymer (SMP) with photo-polymerization method. A novel SMP was successfully prepared from the photo-curable resin synthesized with hexamethylenediacrylate and 1,6-Hexanedithiol. The photo-cured polymer forms semi-crystalline reversible phase and chemically cross-linked netpoints. They show good thermal-induced shape memory effect with about 92% shape fixity and about 99% shape recovery. Moreover, the photo-cured SMPs have excellent thermal-induced shape reconfiguration properties. A new permanent shape could be reconfigured easily by heat treatment at 130 degrees C. It is thus proposed that the photo-curable resin could be used as "printing ink" for SMP 4D printing applications. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This letter focuses on finding the balance from optical absorption and performance on oxidation of water induced by sunlight irradiation. A simple and scalable chemical based spin-coating deposition method was employed to tailor an active hematite-substrate interface. The improvement achieved was attributed to a good balance found in light absorption and a hematite layer adherence that favors more efficient charge injection through the interface (hematite/substrate) and avoiding fast electron-photogenerated hole recombination. The present findings reopen the opportunity for using a low-cost and scalable method to produce efficient PEC photoelectrodes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Minor-phase globule collision (MPGC) is of crucial significance in the final microstructure of droplet-shaped immiscible alloy. However, the specific relationship is difficult to be determined due to the opaque in metallic systems. Here, by using transparent SCN-60 wt.% H2O mixture, MPGC was studied under different temperature gradients (TGs), and the relation of MPGC and TG was determined. It was found that MPGC was sharply dependent of TG and affected the final morphology. For a higher TG case, the induced MPGC was stronger and finally resulted in a one-aggregation structure, whereas the MPGC was very weak in a lower TG case, and it eventually led to a multi-aggregation structure. The findings open an opportunity for the design of potential microstructures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inspired by the integrated adsorption/degradation purification performances of paddy soil, a biomimetic paddy-soil-like superior purification material has been hydrothermally synthesized from natural zeolites. The formations of tobermorite and hydroxyapatite benefited the flexural strength up to 12 MPa and adsorptive properties to contaminants. In sewage treatment experiments, the zeolite-based materials achieved the limited removal rates of 34.6% (from 364 to 238 mg/L) and 26.3% (from 46.6 to 34.3 mg/L) respectively for COD and NH4+ due to saturation adsorption. After bioburden, the removal rate of COD and NH4+ increased significantly to 93.4% (from 364 to 24 mg/L) and 81.1% (from 46.6 to 8.8 mg/L), reflecting the integrated function of adsorption and further degradation. The variations of NO3-/NO2- showed that various microorganisms within the matrix did contribute to the continuous and efficient purification performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we report a green, nontoxic, no-residue method for degradation of methylene blue (MB) using Cu-Cu2O films prepared with spinach leaves extract. The photocatalytic activity for two composite films with different copper concentrations, specifically 0.01 M and 0.05 M, was investigated under natural outdoor light which has an average irradiation of 3 mW/cm(2). An overall degradation of 97.7% was achieved using the 0.05 M Cu-Cu2O composite, over a time duration of 180 min. We believe that the native oxidizing property of spinach extract played a major role in enhancing the photocatalytic activities of our films and gave them equitable reaction kinetics under natural daylight.

AB The introduction of additive manufactured steels on automotive industry unavoidably involves the resistance spot welding between materials. Due to rapid heating and cooling rates of welding process, the fusion zone shows anisotropic properties in scanning and building directions. This paper aims to investigate the microstructure and mechanical properties of different orientations in the fusion zone of resistance spot welded 316L stainless steels using SEM, EBSD and hardness tests. Microstructure in the building direction exhibited more austenite-to-ferrite transformation, leading to the change of grain orientation of austenite structure from < 1 0 1 > to < 1 1 1 >. All of these result in inferior hardness in comparison with scanning direction. The scanning direction show better mechanical properties than building direction in the spot welds.

AB Hierarchical microstructure ZnO was successfully prepared by a simple one-step hydrothermal method and annealing process, and its crystal structure, morphology and pore distribution were characterized. The gas sensing performance test results show that the response of the ZnO sensor has a good linear relationship with 10-500 ppm of methane, and the sensor has a low initial methane response concentration with good sensitivity and stability. This work implies that this hierarchical ZnO is expected to be a potential candidate for low-concentration methane sensing. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Syntactic foams are widely used in damage tolerance and low-density applications. In present work compressive behavior of 3D printed three-phase syntactic foams under quasi-static strain rates (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 s(-1)) are investigated. Extruded filaments of High density polyethylene (HDPE) with environmentally pollutant fly ash cenospheres (0, 20, 40 and 60 vol%) are used for 3D printing. Micrography reveal that syntactic foam filament and 3D printed samples are three phase systems comprising matrix, cenosphere and porosity. Matrix porosity of about 7% makes these foams lightweight and suitable for buoyant applications. The compressive properties are extracted from the stress-strain plots. It is observed that modulus and specific modulus increases with strain rate and cenosphere content. Specific compressive strength increases with strain rate and decrease with cenosphere content.

AB LaSe2 films were prepared on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining magnetron sputtering and selenized annealing. The influence of selenized annealing time on the structures and photoelectric properties of the thin films were investigated using glancing incident X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectrometry and Hall effect measurements. The results showed that the film had a perfect monoclinic structure and a smooth surface morphology. The average transmittance in the mid-infrared range was greater than 55%, and the highest was 65%. The LaSe2 films had a higher carrier concentration (similar to 10(19) cm(-3)) and conductivity (similar to 1.9 S/cm) than those of other P-type transparent conductive films, which showed that LaSe2 was a potential new P-type material.

AB The first report on acoustic absorption properties of transparent biopolymer aerogel is provided. Cross-linked chitosan aerogel prepared by supercritical carbon dioxide drying has a homogeneous nanofibrous structure with mesopores, the major size of which decreases from similar to 45 to similar to 20 nm with increasing apparent density. The aerogel shows peak-shaped sound absorption profiles, regardless of the density. This absorption is attributable to sample vibration reflecting an extremely high flow resistivity of the mesoporous structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Epoxy composites exhibiting high dielectric constant, low dissipation and reduced water absorption were prepared using a functionalized agro-waste as filler. The approach involved thin coating of Polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer over micron sized paddy straw (St) particles accomplished via vapour phase polymerization. The PPy coated particles filled epoxy composites exhibited a significant similar to 315% increase in dielectric constant (similar to 23 at 1 KHz), low dissipation factor (0.017 at 1 KHz) and marked reduction in water absorption (similar to 50%; 360 h) as compared to their counterparts filled with uncoated particles.

AB The aim of the paper was to study the strain variation during the isothermal B2 -> B19' transformation in NiTi-based alloy. It was found that isothermal holding of the Ti40.7Hf9.5Ni44.8Cu5 alloy under a stress of 235 MPa at constant temperatures, which were close to the start temperature of the B2 -> B19' transition, was accompanied by an additional strain variation. This strain was completely reversible on further heating and depended on the position of the holding temperature compared to the start temperature of the forward transformation. The maximum of isothermal strain of 2.9% was observed during holding at a temperature of 50 degrees C. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The local heat accumulation through a line order hatching strategy was considered when a Co-28Cr-6Mo alloy was fabricated by powder bed fusion with electron beam. The study revealed that by weakening the local heat accumulation, overheating as a source of unevenness was easily avoided. Transient geometry of the molten pool and associated temperature gradient direction were determined by the local heat accumulation, which subsequently alters the solidification microstructure. The numerical simulations were performed to clarify the mechanisms involved. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A range of hyperspectral imaging techniques are presented as a novel method of surface characterization for thermal control coatings, and potentially a wide range of other materials. Spatially resolved Fourier-transform infrared imaging and visible/near-infrared imaging in combination with principal component analysis of the SolarBlack thermal control coating confirmed the presence of periodic variations in reflectance and thermal emittance. This periodicity is due to the rastering nature of the coating process. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article demonstrates the effect of substrate temperature on the pulsed-laser deposition of cadmium sulfide nanoparticles (CdS NPs). Synthesis of CdS NPs on silicon substrates was realized at a temperature range of 150-550 degrees C. The XRD patterns confirm that CdS NPs showed a wurtzite-hexagonal phase with crystallite size changes between 15 and 24 nm. Also, the SEM images indicate that the temperature is a crucial parameter could determine the morphology of the nanoparticles. Hence, some films exhibited aggregation and cracks causing a significant degradation in the crystalline quality. The results identify that the best quality CdS NPs correspond to an optimal temperature of 450 degrees C at which the nano-heterostructures could be useful for nanoelectronic applications.

AB This work reports the microstructural and thermoelectric characterization of the misfit [Ca2CoO3-delta](0.62)[CoO2] compound obtained by a solid-state synthesis using mollusk shells and a proteic sol-gel method, which uses gelatin as a polymerizing agent. The results clearly demonstrate the capability of these routes to produce pure Ca3Co4O9 with plate-like morphology. Sintered ceramic samples show randomly oriented grains and relative densities in the range of 63-67%. The obtained microstructures provide reasonable electrical properties and result in competitive thermoelectric performance for the material prepared by the proteic sol-gel synthesis (P.F. of 205 mu W/K-2 m at 700 degrees C).

AB The rapid solidification mechanism of Ni3Ti intermetallic compound within undercooled Ni75Ti25 and Ni74Ti18Al8 alloys was investigated by electrostatic levitation(ESL) and liquid quenching(LQ) techniques. The dendritic growth velocity of Ni3Ti phase in these two alloys revealed power law relations versus liquid undercooling, whose maximum value was 138.9 mm s(-1) for binary Ni75Ti25 alloy at 255 K(0.15T(L)) undercooling, while it was only 54.7 mm s(-1) at 222 K(0.13T(L)) undercooling for ternary Ni74Ti18Al8 alloy. The crystalline structure of Ni3Ti phase in both alloys was characterized by fine dendrites under LQ state, whereas it displayed faceted growth mode under ESL condition. In addition, the Ni3Ti grains of Ni75Ti25 alloy show a transition from incompletely to completely surrounded by the grain boundaries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CONDUCTIVITY
AB Of most solid materials available as potential solid electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries, the crystalline perovskite type lithium lanthanum titanate (Li0.5La0.5TiO3 or LLTO) has been shown to possess one of the highest room temperature bulk ionic conductivity. However, grain boundary contributions lower this value by two orders of magnitude. Herein, we present a composite of silica-based glass and perovskite which results in an amorphous composite having denser microstructure and better stability than the LLTO itself. Also, this composite possessed no grain boundary contributions and has an increased ionic conductivity than crystalline perovskite. An alternate fabrication route further improved the conductivity of the composite electrolyte. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel Cu2O@HNbWO6 p-n heterojunction photocatalyst was synthesized via solution redox method, which showed excellent photocatalytic activity and stability for the degradation of MB solution under simulated solar irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the p-n heterojunction formed between Cu2O and HNbWO6, which can improve the separation and migration of the photo-induced electron-hole pairs and provide enriched active sites. Further, in order to explore the relationship between the structure and properties of the photocatalyst, the compositions and structures of the photocatalyst were characterized in detail by SEM, XRD, Raman and UV-vis DRS, etc. Finally, the possible photocatalytic enhancement mechanism was proposed.

AB The structural parameters of the Bi(0.85)AE(0.15)Fe(0.85)Ti(0.15)O(3) (AE = Ca and Ba) multiferroics have been determined using variable temperature neutron powder diffraction. The compounds adopt the polar rhombohedral R3c structure near room temperature and undergo phase transitions into either the nonpolar orthorhombic Pnma (AE = Ca) or cubic Pm (3) over barm (AE = Ba) structures on heating. In the ferroelectric phase, a temperature-driven lattice expansion is accompanied by both a diminishing of the off-center ionic displacements (thus resulting in a decrease in the spontaneous electric polarization) and a reduction in the magnitude of the antiphase oxygen octahedra tilting. Being largely different for the materials under study, the latter parameter is supposed to specify the dissimilarity in their magnetic properties. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The exchange bias effect on single layer of Fe-rich FeRh thin film
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Thin films; Magnetic materials; Exchange bias; Order parameter
AB Thin films of Fe rich FeRh were prepared by using DC magnetron sputtering from a Fe67Rh33 target onto MgO (0 0 1) substrate. In particular, here we identify a unique exchange-bias phenomenon. This is one of the homogenous system to have an exchange bias phenomena without the presence of two layer system with well-defined interface of ferromagnetic (FM)/antiferromagnetic (AFM) layers. Meanwhile, annealing at higher temperatures resulted in ordering of FeRh alloy which in turn gives rise to a higher exchange bias strength. Possible scenario for the exchange bias should have occurred from the boundaries between AFM/FM domains which could be due to the formation of AFM domain inside of FM matrix or vice versa in our single layer thin film.

ID PERFORMANCE; CATHODE
AB Li-S batteries with high theoretical energy density are considered as promising energy storage devices. However, the reduction reaction of element sulfur converts to the long-chain lithium polysulfide, which could soluble into the liquid electrolyte. As a result, the utilization of active sulfur materials is low, leading to a rapid capacity deceasing. Herein, the strategy of separator modification were used to introduce the mesoporous carbon hollow spheres impregnated with CoS2 into Li-S batteries. The CoS2 with polar groups provide chemical bonding sites for polysulfides. Meanwhile, the mesoporous carbon hollow spheres with large specific surface area served as the polysulfide trappers through strong physical affinity. Owing to the synergetic effects of physical and chemical interaction, the prepared composite could efficiently hinder the shuttle effect, which is the soluble polysulfides shuttling between the anode and cathode. Therefore, Li-S batteries with modified separators exhibit highly reversible capacity of 651 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0 C and superior rate capability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Diamond/Ag/Cu-Ti composites were fabricated by low-cost pressureless sintering with Ti addition to improve the diamond-metal matrix wettability and the effects of Ag/Cu matrix variation on the composites were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy identified the interfacial structure on the diamond (1 0 0) plane of the diamond/Ag/Cu-Ti composite with the 80 at.% Cu matrix as Cu-Ag/TiC/Ag-C/TiC/diamond. The thermal conductivity of the diamond/Ag/Cu-Ti composites was significantly enhanced upon increasing the Ag contents of the Ag/Cu matrix. The 60 vol% diamond/Ag/Cu-2 at.% Ti composite with 40 at.% Cu matrix content exhibited the maximum thermal conductivity of 826 W/m.K and the compatible coefficient of thermal expansion of 6.0 ppm/K. The diamond/Ag/Cu-Ti composites are promising low-cost thermal management materials for electronic device integration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of Zn2+ incorporation on Faujasite (FAU) framework's structure and lattice crystallinity is investigated to check the maximum zinc amount that can be loaded without destabilizing the zeolite framework. Zn2+ was doped on large pore HY zeolite (denoted as xZn-HY, x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 M) by ion-exchange method. 2.24 mmol/g of Zn2+ was present in 2.0Zn-HY and was found to be disruptive for HY framework. Further, the performance of these materials as catalysts was tested in an industrially important Freidel-Crafts alkylation reaction forming thymol. This work throws light on the importance of rational catalyst material design wherein a balance between the amount of metal and the intactness of the zeolite framework affects catalyst activity.

The as-prepared products demonstrated a novel hollow urchin-like SnO2 nanosphere with the diameter of around 500 nm. It exhibited a high response and selectivity toward ethylene glycol at a lower heating voltage. The excellent ethylene glycol response was attributed to the hollow structure, the nanorods building blocks and the unique architecture structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DUCTILITY
AB Two different ultrafine-grained states have been achieved in an Al-30Zn (wt%) alloy by high-pressure torsion (HPT) in different conditions. The material processed at room temperature exhibits a two phases mixture with Zn particles that have nucleated inside Al grains but also at triple lines and Zn segregation at grain boundaries. Under tensile stress at room temperature, this ultrafine grain structure gives rise to a superplastic behaviour with a total elongation exceeding 200%. Interestingly, further deformation by HPT at 50 degrees C leads to significantly finer intragranular Zn precipitates which affects the mechanical behavior reducing the elongation to failure down to only 70%. This transition in superplastic behaviour is attributed these fine scale Zn particles that should lead to a greater accumulation of dislocations and earlier failure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Graphene oxide (GO) is then composited into them through physical mixing followed by freezedrying. When assembled as anodes for Li-ion batteries, samples containing Mo, including MoO2/Mo and MoO2/Mo-GO, possess not only high initial columbic efficiency (ICE) but also high capacity, stability and rate performance.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless gas with a smell of rotten eggs which poses great threat on human health and environmental protection. Traditional metal oxide based H2S sensors always suffer from undesirable selectivity and elevated operation temperature. To overcome these obstacles, in this report cuprous oxide nanowires/nanoparticles (Cu2O) anchored onto reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO) were prepared to serve as the sensing layer. Multiple characterization techniques such as SEM, TEM, FTIR, and XRD were utilized to explore the sensor performance toward H2S gas. Compared to the partial recovery at 25 degrees C, the prepared rGO/Cu2O sensor showed a response of 20% toward 1 ppm H2S at 40 degrees C, together with full restoration, excellent repeatability, long-term stability and selectivity. Favorable film porosity, highly conductive rGO nanosheets and nanometer size effect of Cu2O materials were responsible for these inspiring results, paving the avenue for future trace H2S detection in the aspects of higher sensitivity and lower power-consumption.

AB Clay, which is a well-stocked mineral, has often been applied to colorful coatings. Sepiolite is a kind of clay that has excellent properties but has not being reported as a color paint. In this study, a colored paint composed of sepiolite, cationic dye, and organosilanes was sprayed with epoxy resin to form a colorful super-hydrophobic coating. The low surface energy of organosilane and the micro-nano microstructure of the coating can form bubbles between the solid and liquid, endowing the coating with good water repellency and with a self-cleaning property. In addition, for aqueous solutions with pH ranging from 1 to 13, the contact angle (CA) of the coating remained greater than 150 degrees. The chemical stability of the coating was very good and did not fade, even after immersion in 1 M NaOH or HCl solution for 24 h. The scratch test on the coating did not destroy the superhydrophobicity of the coating. Additionally, the coating had good mechanical durability, and its CA was still greater than 150 degrees after 50 times of tape test. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The microstructure properties of reactive multilayers play a key role in their chemical reactions. Ru/Al multilayers are investigated in as-deposited and annealed conditions using atom probe tomography to probe the interdiffusion and early phase formation. Performing atom probe analysis was accompanied with difficulties stemming from weak adhesion of the bi-layers and reconstruction artifacts. Nonetheless, it was possible to obtain valuable qualitative information concerning diffusion kinetics. Asymmetric interdiffusion during deposition is found. Grain boundary diffusion is shown to have a major contribution on enhancing mass-transport across the layers as well as on the nucleation and growth of the RuAl6 intermetallic phase.

AB In this study, we prepared a host-guest (H-G) complex containing graphene (Gp) by utilizing the H-G supramolecular force of cyclodextrin (Cd) and azobenzene (Ab). Then we synthesized a conductive composite (CC) by using Gp-Cd-Ab H-G complex. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of CC confirmed the presence of H-G supramolecular assemblies. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed CC had smaller bulk resistance. The tensile curves showed CC had larger Young's modulus. CC had the properties of conductive and mechanical self-healing. CC also showed strain sensing performance. Thus the composite showed potential application in healable soft sensor.

AB Crystalline ultrathin TiO2 nanowires with oriented configurations are promising for high-performance energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we use hierarchical microspheres constructed from radially oriented single-crystalline TiO2 nanowires as electrode materials for reversible Mg-ion intercalation. The obtained mesoporous TiO2 nanowires deliver a capacity of 118 mA h g (1) at 20 mA/g current rate. The ultra small size of TiO2 nanocrystalline is beneficial for reaction kinetics, enhance the bulk intercalation of Mg ions, which remarkably increases storage capacity of TiO2. The discharge capacity over 100 cycles remains 105.2 mA h g (1), demonstrating the superiority of this material structure and its potential in magnesium ion batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel emulsion polymerization-extraction method was developed to synthesize polyanilines(PANIs). Compared with reported works, this method could prepare the xylene solution of PANIs directly with significantly enhanced concentration (24.08-64.50 g/L in this work vs. 3.83 g/L in reference), facilitating the preparation of uniform PANIs/poly(styrene-ethylene-butadienestyrene) (SEBS) mixtures to make the PANIs/SEBS conductive films. The as-prepared PANIs/SEBS films possessed as good conductivities as the reference reports (4.9 x 10(-5)-9.3 x 10(-2) S/cm in this work vs. 10(-5)-10(-4) S/cm in reference), and might be widely applied as flexible conductive materials in fabrication of some critical components (e.g. wearable devices) in electronic industry.

AB The pure praseodymium oxide aerogel with ultra-low density (about 10.7 mg/cm(3)) was prepared by using solution-freeze-drying-calcination method for the first time. The results of BET, SEM and TEM indicated that the pure praseodymium oxide aerogel belonged to the mesoporous material, which showed a typical three-dimensional porous structure. The results of TG/DSC showed that the praseodymium oxide aerogel could decrease the ammonium perchlorate decomposition temperature by 54.7 degrees C and enhance the heat production from 121.3 J/g to 838.5 J/g. The maximum adsorption amounts of praseodymium oxide aerogel reached 251.1 mg/g for uranium. This method provides a new strategy for preparation of low density metal oxide aerogels.

Addition of NaOH in pure 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solution containing BP nanoflakes facilitates the formation of smaller BP nanoflakes from bulk crystals allowing for the use as a battery anode. A remarkable increase in the initial discharging capacity from 91 to 954 mAh/g through simple treatments including the addition of NaOH followed by thermal annealing results from initiation of the multistep reactions associated with the formation of LiP, Li2P, and Li3P.

TI Influence of radial convection on microstructure development in Sn-Ni

ID DIRECTIONAL SOLIDIFICATION
AB The influence of radial convection on the microstructure development has been investigated in directionally solidified Sn-36at.%Ni peritectic alloys at a constant growth velocity with different sample diameters. Since the rejected Sn is denser than Ni, there existed no axial convection in directionally solidified Sn36at.%Ni peritectic alloys, however, the radial convection still influenced the microstructures. It was demonstrated through the dendrite tip radius R that the diffusive growth condition could be obtained in this alloy when the sample diameter was reduced to 1 mm. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the radial convection could obviously promote the peritectic transformation process in Sn-Ni peritectic alloy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Zn dissolution and production of a solid solution during friction surfacing confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The results showed a solid solution, which was formed during friction surfacing and decomposed due to artificial aging, resulting in the formation of AlMg4Zn11 precipitates.

AB A quick and efficient approach was employed for the growth of nanocrystalline tungsten oxide (WO3) thin films using one-step hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method at low temperature. In a typical experiment, the parent material tungsten (W) was subjected to oxidation, gasification and its subsequent condensation to obtain the uniform deposition of WO3 thin film on silicon substrate at significantly low temperature of similar to 200 degrees C. Prepared WO3 thin film possessed the cauliflower nanostructure (WCNs) with typical monoclinic WO3 crystal structure. Prepared WCNs thin films were applied for the detection of hydrogen (H-2) gas at 100 ppm. H-2 response increased with rise in temperature and the maximum response of similar to 87% was obtained at the optimized temperature of similar to 250 degrees C with response time 180 s.

AB The present study aims to prepare cerium hexaaluminate (CeAl11O18) via a sol-gel technique and to study the effect of the phase composition and microstructure on its mechanical properties. The samples were hot pressed at 1550 degrees C under a pressure of 40 MPa for 2 h. The apparent porosity and the relative density of the sintered samples were evaluated as well as their phase composition and microstructure. The results indicated that the only phase present in the densified bodies was the pure CeAl11O18 phase. The microstructure investigations indicated the presence of both cerium hexaaluminate and cerium monoaluminate (CeAlO3) remnants. Both the Vickers hardness and bending strength of the sintered bodies were lower than those of pure alumina; however, the fracture toughness of the sintered bodies was high.

ID FABRICATION
AB ZnO seed and nanoarrays were effectively integrated on polyimide (PI) substrates by depositing the ZnO seed during thermal imination of PI. The surface roughness of PI films with different imidization degrees was different; the maximum root-mean square-value was achieved when the imidization degree was 80%. The prepared wurtzite-type ZnO seed and nanorods showed preferential c-axis orientation and offered good adhesion to flexible PI substrates. The light transmittance of the functionalized film, which mainly depends on PI, was sufficiently large in the visible region. Therefore, the proposed methodology is a novel route for synthesizing a variety of nanostructures on PI films at a low cost. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Two high strength low alloy steels with different carbon content were studied to elucidate the effect of carbon content on hardenability in terms of crystallography. The hardness reduction from 2 to 50 mm distance from the surface in end-quenched steels of 0.09C and 0.12C was 8.0 and 3.2 HRC, respectively, which implied higher hardenability of 0.12C steel than 0.09C. At low cooling rate, the microstructure of 0.09C and 0.12C steel was granular and lath bainite, respectively, and the density of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) of 0.12C steel was significantly greater than 0.09C. Carbon improved the hardenability by optimizing the variant selection to increase the density of high angle grain boundary (HAGB). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic dye contaminants are becoming a worldwide challenge for water resources due to their non-natural degradation, highly toxic and carcinogenic. In this work, the molecular ferroelectric material (MV)[BiI3Cl2] synthesized by the solvothermal method was first applied to the adsorption of organic dye contaminants. Interestingly, the adsorption capacity of the (MV)[BiI3Cl2] powder was found to reach a high value of 793 and 10,476 mg g(-1) for fluorescein sodium and Congo red, respectively. The adsorption process can be well described by the Langmuir model.

AB In this study, the effects of cryogenic laser peening (CLP) on mechanical properties and damping capacity of pure titanium (Ti) were explored. The experimental results showed that CLP improved the tensile properties and in-depth microhardness of pure Ti, while the compressive residual stress was introduced in the surface layer. Meanwhile, the damping ratio was also increased after CLP process. The synergistic strengthening effect of CLP could effectively accelerate the formation of deformation twin, which contributed to the simultaneous improvement in mechanical properties and damping capacity of pure Ti.

AB The evolution of the aluminum alloy of the A3xx Al-Si-Mn-Fe series in the equal-channel angular pressing with back pressure with the strain of 0.75 per cycle has been carried out. After preliminary annealing dispersed inclusions of three types have been observed in the alloy: rod-like particles, planar-shaped rounded forms, and silicon particles. Two parallel grain refining schemes have been detected that ensure grinding the grains to the size of about 1 mu m and smaller than 150 nm after the 1.5 degree of deformation. Three cycles of deformation lead to the appearance of small cracks in the sample, the destruction of the sample occurs at the total strain of 3. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon nanotubes/graphene/nickel (CNT-G-Ni) fluffy spheres were synthesized using renewable carbon sources. Carbon-encapsulated nickel nanoparticles (CENNs) were prepared by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of potato starch and nickel nitrate, and then followed by catalytic graphitization at 900 degrees C. The prepared GENNs were cracked at 700 degrees C in biogas, during which graphene shells over GENNs were peeled off and formed graphene nanoplatelets, and simultaneously multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were formed over nickel particles and in-situ integrated into graphene nanoplatelets to obtain CNT-G-Ni fluffy spheres. The prepared 3D nanocomposite was investigated for the removal of organic solvent from water and its adsorption capacity above 110 g/g. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID REMEDIATION
AB Titanium dioxide film as a stable material plays an important role in photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. One of the ways to improve photocatalytic efficiency is to increase the active sites on the semiconductor surface. Photolithography is a manufacturing technique for controlling precisely micrographics on surface. Here grating-structured, square-structured and hexagon-structured TiO2 films were prepared by photolithography and the effects of various surface structures on photocatalysis were studied. It was demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 film was not always improved as the surface area increased. The micro-patterned surface would also impede the mass transfer in the process of photocatalysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study developed a novel column type feed spacer with the aim to reduce the specific energy consumption (SEC) of the membrane based water filtration system. The proposed spacer increases the clearance between the filament and the membrane (reducing the spacer filament diameter) while keeping the same flow channel thickness as compared to a standard non-woven symmetric spacer. Since the higher clearance reduces the flow unsteadiness, column type nodes were added in the spacer structure as additional vortex shading bodies. Fluid flow behaviour in the channel for this spacer was numerically simulated by 3D CFD studies and then compared with the standard spacer. The numerical results showed that the proposed spacer substantially reduced the pressure drop, shear stress at the constriction region and shortened the dead zone. Finally, these findings were confirmed experimentally by investigating the filtration performances using the 3D printed prototypes of these spacers in a lab scale filtration module. It is observed that the column spacer reduced the pressure drop by three times and doubled the specific water flux. 2D OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) scans of the membrane surface acquired after the filtration revealed much lower biomass accumulation using the proposed spacer. Consequently, the SEC for the column spacer was found about two folds lower than the standard spacer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Equilibrium of three reactants (oxygen, proton and electron) in oxygen reduction reaction at large current flux is necessary for highly efficient electro-generation of H2O2. In this work, we investigated reactants equilibrium and H2O2 electrochemical production in liquid-gas-solid three phase interfaces on rolling cathodes with high electroactive area, Electrocatalytic reaction accelerated the electrolyte intrusion into hydrophobic porous catalyst layer for higher electroactive surface area, resulting in a 21% increase of H2O2 yield at 15 mA cm(-2). Air aerated cathode submerged in air/O-2 aeration solution was unable to produce H2O2 efficiently due to the lack of O-2 in three phase interfaces (TPls), especially at current density > 2.5 mA cm(-2). For air breathing cathode, stable TPIs inside the active sites was created by addition of gas diffusion layer, to increase H2O2 production from 11 +/- 2 to 172 +/- 11 mg L-1 h(-1) at 15 mA cm-2. Pressurized air flow application enhanced both oxygen supply and H2O2 departure transfer to obtain a high H2O2 production of 461 +/- 11 mg L-1 h(-1) with CE of 89 2% at 35 mA cm(-2), 45% higher than passive gas transfer systems. Our findings provided a new insight of carbonaceous air cathode performance in producing H2O2, providing important information for the practical application and amplification of cathodes in the future.

TI Humic substances as electron acceptors for anaerobic oxidation of

AB Humic substances (humics) are ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic environments where they can serve as electron acceptors for anaerobic oxidation of organic compounds. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, as well as the least reactive organic molecule. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to microbial reduction of various electron acceptors plays a crucial role in mitigating methane emissions. Here, we reported that humics could serve as terminal electron acceptors for AOM using enriched nitrate-reducing AOM microorganisms. AOM coupled to the reduction of humics was demonstrated based on the production of C-13-labelled carbon dioxide, and AOM activity was evaluated with different methane partial pressures and electron acceptor concentrations. After three-cycle reduction, both AOM activity and copy numbers of the archaea 16S rRNA and mcrA genes were the highest when anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid and anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid were electron acceptors. The high throughput sequencing results suggested that ANME-2d were the dominant methane oxidation archaea after humics reduction, although the partner bacteria NC10 trended downward, other reported humics reduction bacteria (Geobactor and Anammox) appeared. The potential electron transfer models from ANME-2d to humics were proposed. These results enable a better understanding of available electron acceptors for AOM in natural environments and broaden our insight into the significant role of ANME-2d. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
