AB Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to deposit platinum (Pt) shell in 0, 50, 100, and 150 cycles on thermally evaporated vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanostructures (NSs) with a [1 1 0] growth direction forming V2O5@Pt core-shell nanostructures (CSNSs). The optical properties that were obtained from the photoluminescence spectra showed that emission at 466 nm increased and that at 520-580 nm decreased as the number of ALD cycles of deposition of the N shell increased, owing to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the lowering of contact resistance at the interface between the V2O5 core and N shell.

AB Ammonia (NH3) has been considered as a promising alternative for hydrogen storage. In this work, the decomposition mechanism of ammonia was studied on various Pd-doped Cu(1 0 0) surfaces by DFT calculations. It was found that the coverage of Pd atoms on Cu(1 0 0) surface made an evident influence on the interaction between the NHx and substrate. The doped Pd atoms significantly promoted NH3 decomposition kinetically and thermodynamically compared to Cu(1 0 0), confirming the synergistic effect between Pd and Cu. The catalytic activity and selectivity of various Pd-Cu(1 0 0) surfaces for NH3 decomposition were dependent upon the coverage of Pd atoms to some extent.

AB Microwave Assisted Combustion technique was employed to prepare higly stable niobium pentoxide - Nb2O5-nanoparticles using ammonium niobium oxalate as precursor, ammonium nitrate as oxidant and urea as fuel. The synthesized sample has showed good results for catalytic processes and its morphological and crystalline characterizations have been performed using gas adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. This routine is quite promising for massive production of high quality crystalline Nb2O5 nanoparticle without further calcination or heat treatment for photocatalytical processes.

AB MWCNT/BiOBr composite was successfully designed through interfacial linkage of amide bonds or hydrogen bonds by utilizing the reaction between amino groups of MWCNT and residual carboxyl or hydroxyl groups on the surface of prepared BiOBr. Retaining similar morphology, size and crystallinity with pure BiOBr, the obviously enhanced photocatalytic performance of the 2 wt.% MWCNT/BiOBr composite can be attributed to effective capture and transport of photo-generated electrons by MWCNT through the interfacial covalent bond.

AB In this work, we study the controlled growth of one-dimensional tellurium nanorods using molecular beam epitaxy on Si (1 1 1) substrates, and then as-grown high-density nanorods are fabricated into photodetectors. The morphology, growth mechanism, crystal structures, and photoresponse characteristics of tellurium nanorods are systematically studied in detail. The photodetector based on Te-nanorods shows fast response and decay time and broad-spectral response in a wide wavelength from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared regime. These findings further expend our knowledge about optoelectronic properties of Te nanorods and provide a possibility to the further development of nanorods multifunctional devices.

AB Nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are more mutagenic and carcinogenic than parent PAHs. The formation mechanism of dinitro-pyrenes initiated by OH from mononitro-pyrenes was conducted by quantum chemical calculations. The products are 1,2-, 1,7-, 2,4-, 2,5- and 2,7- dinitropyrenes. Water molecules can decrease the Gibbs activation barriers of water loss step of NO2 -OH-nitropyrene. By canonical variational transition state theory with small curvature tunneling correction, the calculated overall rate constants for 1-, 2- and 4-nitropyrene are 8.13 x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), 8.90 x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and 1.50 x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 298 K and 1 atm, respectively.

AB Quasiclassical trajectories have been run for N-2(A(3)Sigma(+)(u)) + H(S-2) collisions allowing for electronic transitions through surface hopping. An accurate multi-sheeted representation of the HN2 potential energy surface has been employed. For the rate constant at room temperature, we obtain (9.85 +/- 0.16) x 10(-10) cm(3 )s(-1), a value fivefold larger than the recommended experimental one. Unprecedently, we investigate the temperature dependence of the rate constant, and obtained an essentially flat Arrehenius plot. We estimate that the NH yield is at least one order of magnitude lower than the experimental upper limit.

AB The two-dimensional (2D) materials offer tremendous opportunities for efficient, ultrathin solar cells beyond conventional three-dimensional materials. In this work, we study the interfacial electrical properties and charge transfer characteristics of the SiAs2/GeP2 heterostructure by first-principles calculations. The SiAs2/GeP2 heterostructure shows a 2.25 eV bandgap and pronounced solar light absorption. Furthermore, the heterostructure presents a type-II alignment, and possesses a desirable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 12.1%. These results reveal that SiAs2/GeP(2)is promising for solar energy conversion in photovoltaic applications, and also provide a possible alternative for experiment scheme.

AB We report an experimental method for simultaneous measurement of the electric properties and energy transfer by natural biological fibers. We found that energy transfer efficiency along intermediate filaments (IFs) isolated from porcine retina varied with the potential difference applied to these IFs. The maximum measured effect amounted to 25% of the transfer efficiency increase. The recorded I/U plots characteristic of the IFs demonstrate the behavior of a semiconductor with 0.62 eV band gap. These results show that the image signal might be modulated by the potential difference across the cell membrane, facilitating image contrast enhancement in the brain.

AB The isobaric heat capacity and the coefficient of thermal expansion of a binary liquid mixture with a critical point of solution diverge as functions of temperature in the critical region. When the same liquids are used as solvents for chemical reactions, the van's Hoff plot of the extent of reaction diverges in the critical region. According to the phase rule, the physical and chemical properties are isomorphic in the sense that in each case the critical behavior is determined by three fixed thermodynamic intensive variables.

AB Spiro-OMeTAD, which took place of PEDOT:PSS as hole transport material, was used to assist P3HT to transport holes. Inverted hybrid solar cells using P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD with layered (Device A) and/or blended (Device B) structures were fabricated. Power conversion efficiency of 1.24% was achieved for the latter device vs 0.53% for the former one. Here, the blended surface was smoother for closer electrical contact with the Cu electrode, leading to more efficient collection of holes. This study is the first report on layered and blended structures of ZnO-based inverted hybrid solar cells with P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD.

AB A kinetic model of the process response of nervous tissue to an external signal stimulus is proposed. The model is based on the multistage and non-linear nature of the dynamic process of changes of N-acetylaspartate concentration. The existence of multiple steady states explains the trigger effect of the system. The effect of substrate inhibition for this system was studied as a necessary factor of N-acetylaspartate's autostabilization as a key metabolite in the brain. The appearance of N-acetylaspartate's "anti-peak" causes a wave of its hydrolysis products, such as aspartic acid and acetic acid.

AB In the present work, a number of cyclic planar molecules M(2)A(2) (M = Be, Mg, Ca; A = Li, Na, K) are considered to calculate second-hyperpolarizability using HF, MP2, CCSD, CCSD(T) and DFT methods and 6-311 + + G(d,p), Sadlej-pVTZ, aug-pc-2 and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The molecules are thermodynamically stable. The diffuse electrons on alkali metals are more efficient on enhancing the magnitude of second-hyperpolarizability. The two-state model can explain the origin of second-hyperpolarizability. The rather highest magnitude of second-hyperpolarizability (10(7) au) of the Ca2K2 complex arises from the intense lower energy transition. The vibrational contribution to second-hyperpolarizability has been found to be significant.

AB Objectives: To estimate uptake of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods immediately after surgical abortion in a system that makes these methods readily available, and to determine demographic, medical, social, and visit-specific predictors of immediate post-abortion intrauterine device (IUD) and implant initiation.
   Study design: We performed a retrospective cohort study of LARC (levonorgestrel intrauterine system [IUS], copper IUD, and subdermal implant) initiation at the time of surgical abortion up to 21w0d gestation at Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts from 2012 through 2017. We calculated proportions of IUD and implant initiation and used mixed effect logistic regression to estimate predictors of each outcome.
   Results: Among 26,858 surgical abortion patients, 25.4% received immediate post-abortion LARC: 14.2%, 4.2%, and 7.0% received a levonorgestrel IUS, copper IUD, and implant, respectively. Compared to White women, Black women had lower odds of initiating an IUD (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.89). Multiparous women had greater odds than nulliparous women of initiating an IUD (aOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.57-1.82) or implant (aOR 1.36, 95% 1.20-1.53). We found age was the strongest predictor of implant initiation (<18 versus >= 35: aOR 3.26, 95% CI 2.26-4.71), but was not associated with IUD uptake. Gestational age was not associated with IUD or implant uptake. Implant uptake increased from 2.4% (2012) to 8.7% (2017) (aOR 3.65, 95% CI 2.36-5.65) while IUD uptake remained fairly constant.
   Conclusion: About 25% of women chose to initiate intrauterine or implantable contraception immediately after surgical abortion when these methods are readily available. Implant uptake has increased significantly in recent years. Women who initiated IUDs and implants differed in their demographic and social profiles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We aim to describe demographic trends associated with postabortion contraceptive choice, characteristics of intrauterine device (IUD) users and relation to subsequent abortion.
   Study design: Our retrospective chart review study included all patients obtaining an abortion from 2003 to 2010 at the primary service provider in the Interior Health Region of British Columbia, tracking each patient for 5 years to detect subsequent abortion. We used descriptive statistics to analyze demographic trends and logistic regression to examine determinants of choosing an IUD and likelihood of subsequent abortion per contraceptive method.
   Results: Our study cohort included 5206 patients, 1247 (24.0%) of whom chose an IUD. Patients increased IUD use from 10.14% to 45.74% of the cohort over the study period. Mean age of those choosing an IUD significantly decreased over the study period [30.9 +/- 7.3 years in 2003 to 26.2 +/- 6.5 years in 2010 (p<.001)]. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with choosing an IUD postabortion were prior delivery [aOR=2.77 (95% CI 2.40-3.20)] and being older than 20 years [20-29 years: AOR=1.87 (1.51-2.32); or 30+ years: AOR=1.96 (1.54-2.50)]. Patients choosing an IUD were less likely to have a subsequent abortion compared to those selecting oral contraceptives [aOR=1.96 (95% CI 1.54-2.52)] or depomedroxyprogesterone acetate [aOR=1.84 (95% CI 1.36-2.49)].
   Conclusions: We found an increasing trend of choosing an IUD after an abortion in our population, especially among youth. Patients who chose an IUD postabortion were less likely to have a subsequent abortion over the next 5 years. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To compare the expulsion rate at 6 months after postplacental insertion by intrauterine device (IUD) type.
   Study design: This prospective cohort included participants with a postplacental IUD inserted after vaginal or cesarean delivery, aged 18-45 and >= 24 weeks' gestation. Study enrollment took place after IUD selection and insertion. Participants returned for a postpartum visit and received a short message service survey regarding IUD expulsion, removal, vaginal bleeding and breastfeeding weekly from weeks 0 to 5 and on weeks 12 and 24 postpartum. Multivariable logistic regression examined 6-month expulsion rate by IUD type adjusting for variables that differed between the groups at baseline and in the bivariate analyses.
   Results: Of 114 participants, 75 (65.8%) chose a levonorgestrel 52-mg IUD and 39 (34.2%) chose a copper IUD; 58 (50.9%) had a vaginal delivery, and 56 (49.1%) had a cesarean delivery. Groups were similar except that copper IUD users had a higher median parity (3 vs. 2, p=.03) and a higher proportion of senior residents compared to junior residents had performed insertion (46.2% vs. 22.7%, p=.02). The expulsion rate at 6 months was similar between the levonorgestrel and copper groups (26.7% and 20.5%, respectively; p=.38). Multivariable logistic regression also demonstrated that the odds of expulsion did not differ by IUD type (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.22-4.48).
   Conclusion: The expulsion rate at 6 months after postplacental insertion did not differ between the levonorgestrel and copper IUD type. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The aim of the study was to (1) assess the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and operative time during immediate postpartum tubal ligation procedures and to (2) determine whether operative time is non-inferior in women with BMI >= 30 versus women with BMI <30 and in women with BMI >= 40 versus women with BMI <40.
   Study design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women who received immediate postpartum tubal ligations following vaginal delivery from 2013 to 2017 at a university hospital. We abstracted demographic information, patient and procedural characteristics, and clinical outcomes. We assessed the relationship between BMI and operative time via linear regression. We also conducted non-inferiority analysis to determine whether the mean operative time in women with BMI >= 30 was non-inferior to the mean operative time in women with BMI <30, within a non-inferiority margin of 10 min. We compared intraoperative and postoperative complications in the two groups.
   Results: A total of 279 women were included for analysis, among whom N=79 (28%) had a BMI of 25-29.9 and N=171 (61%) had a BMI >= 30. Demographic characteristics were similar in both groups. We found that operative time increased by 35 s for each one-point increase in BMI (p<.01). Although mean operative time was 46.1 min (n=171; 95% CI 43.7, 48.6 min) for women with BMI >= 30 and 40.6 min (n=108; 95% Cl 37.9 min, 43.4 min) for women with BMI <30, (p<.01), it was non-inferior within a 10-min margin. There was no difference in rates of intraoperative or postoperative complications, incision length, total anesthesia time, and median length of stay between women with BMI >= 30 and BMI <30.
   Conclusion: There is a small increase in postpartum tubal ligation operative time with increasing BMI. However, among women who received immediate postpartum tubal ligations at our institution, women with BMI >= 30 versus BMI <30 had operative times that were non-inferior within a 10-min margin.

AB Objective: To identify the nationwide rate of salpingectomy for permanent contraception before and after the January 2015 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion, Salpingectomy for Ovarian Cancer Prevention.
   Study Design: Using ICD-9/10 diagnosis and procedure codes within the Vizient database, we identify permanent contraception procedures with and without salpingectomy, among females 18-50 years old between January 2013 and January 2017. Subject, hospital characteristics and costs information were recorded. To determine the changes in salpingectomy rates over time analysis was conducted using the Cochran-Armitage trend test and logistic regression models.
   Results: A total of 211,312 women across 303 Vizient-member hospitals underwent a permanent contraception procedure over the study period. Of these, 174,930 subjects were selected from 160 hospitals that contributed data over the full 49-month period. Overall, 25,882 (14.8%) subjects underwent a salpingectomy for an indication of permanent contraception. Higher salpingectomy rates were identified among larger (p<.0001), teaching (p<.0001) hospitals versus smaller, non-teaching hospitals and in subjects with commercial/private payers (p<.0001). A lower salpingectomy rate was observed in Northeast hospitals (p<.0001). Median total hospital costs differed by $25 between permanent contraceptions performed with and without salpingectomy. The proportion of salpingectomies was <1% in January 2013 slowly rising to 20.6% in October 2015 and then 61.5% by January 2017 (p<.0001). During the pre-opinion period (Jan 2013-Dec 2014) the monthly increase in the odds of salpingectomy was 6% (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05, 1.06) compared to a monthly increase of 18% (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.18, 1.18) during the post-opinion period (Jan 2015-Jan 2017).
   Conclusions: The nationwide rate of salpingectomies for permanent contraception has steadily increased among Vizient-member hospitals since the ACOG committee opinion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Can a social media campaign increase the use of long-acting reversible
   contraception? Evidence from a cluster randomized control trial using
   Facebook
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article

ID YOUNG
AB Objective: To test whether an informational campaign carried out on social media increased use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).
   Study design: We implemented a stratified cluster randomized control trial to identify the effect of an informational campaign carried out using Facebook advertisements designed to increase knowledge of the efficacy, ease of use and safety of LARC. We randomized all zip codes in a three-state study area to either a control group or a treatment group. Female Facebook users age 18-34 living in treated clusters received advertisements developed by the researchers in partnership with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England (PPNNE), which sponsored the campaign. We assessed changes in the number and rate of LARC insertions at PPNNE health centers by patients' treatment status.
   Results: Facebook showed 1.8 million advertisements to women residing in 536 randomly assigned treatment clusters. Women living in 545 control clusters did not receive advertisements. We observed 152,743 patient visits across PPNNE's 21 health centers over a 26-month period spanning the advertisement campaign. After treatment, the number of LARC insertions increased by 5.7% (95% CI 0.4%-11.3%, p=.04) among patients living in treated relative to control clusters. This result, however, is driven by patients at a single large health center that was experiencing an increase in patient volume prior to the intervention. If we drop this clinic from the sample, we find no evidence that the campaign had an effect on LARC insertions (0.8% reduction, 95% CI -7.6 to 6.5, p=.83). Moreover, if we control for patient volume, we also find no evidence that the campaign increased insertions per patient (0.5% relative increase in insertions, 95% CI -4.9% to 5.2%, p=.87).
   Conclusion: We conclude that the intervention did not have a detectable impact on LARC insertions in the 4 months after the ad campaign. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To examine obstetrician-gynecologists' practices regarding provision of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods same-day, immediately postpartum, or to women under age 21.
   Study design: Between August 2016 and March 2017, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) sent 2500 of their members an electronic survey questionnaire regarding the provision of LARC methods. ACOG mailed nonresponders paper surveys.
   Results: After exclusions, the final sample was 1280 respondents (52.2% response rate). Although 91% of obstetrician-gynecologists reported providing IUDs, only 29% (95% CI, 26-32%) offered same-day placement. Ninety-two percent (95% Cl, 90-94%) offered IUDs to eligible patients under age 21. Nineteen percent (95% CI, 16.1-21.3%) offered immediate postpartum IUD placement and 21% (95% CI, 18-23%) offered immediate postpartum implant placement. Obstetrician-gynecologists practicing in states where Medicaid reimbursed for immediate postpartum LARC devices within the global fee for delivery (versus separate reimbursement) had lower odds of offering them.
   Conclusion: While most ob-gyns are offering IUDs to women under age 21, many are still not offering them same day. A minority of ob-gyns offer either IUDs or implants immediately postpartum, and there are important geographic and practice setting disparities in this practice. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ID DATA-COLLECTION
AB Objective: Compare bleeding patterns for levonorgestrel 52 mg, 19.5 mg, and 13.5 mg intrauterine system (IUS) products using the World Health Organization Belsey definitions.
   Study design: We extracted available data on bleeding patterns from published sources. Lower dose products had published data at 1 and 3 years; the 52 mg IUS had available data for 1, 2 and 3 years for amenorrhea and 1 and 2 years for other bleeding patterns. We interpolated 2-year data for the lower dose products based on 1- and 3-year data and compared bleeding pattern rates using Fisher exact testing.
   Results: The studies evaluated bleeding patterns in 1700, 1566 and 1531 women using levonorgestrel 52 mg, 19.5 mg and 13.5 mg products, respectively. Amenorrhea rates were greater by 180 days after insertion for 52 mg IUS users (11%) as compared to 19.5 mg (5%, p<.0001) and 13.5 mg (3%, p<.0001). Infrequent bleeding rates were higher for 52 mg users by the end of year 1 (31%) compared to 19.5 mg (26%, p=.01) and 13.5 mg (20%, p<.0001). Irregular bleeding rates were higher with the lower dose products by 90 days after insertion with continued lower rates at the end of year 1 for 52 mg users (6%) compared 19.5 mg (17%, p<.0001) and 13.5 mg (23%, p<.0001). Frequent and prolonged bleeding patterns were similar over the first 2 years for all products, although the rates were statistically higher for levonorgestrel 13.5 mg IUS users compared to 19.5 mg and 52 mg IUS users (p <=.03 for all time points after 90-days post-insertion).
   Conclusions: Levonorgestrel 52 mg IUS users have more amenorrhea and infrequent bleeding and less irregular bleeding compared to women using lower dose levonorgestrel IUS products.
   Implications Statement: All women considering levonorgestrel IUS placement should receive counseling on the differences in bleeding patterns related to the various available doses. Women who are interested in maximizing the likelihood of favorable bleeding should consider a levonorgestrel 52 mg IUS over the lower dose alternatives. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective(s): To explored the antifertility effectiveness and influence on the endometrium of a micro-copper/low-density polyethylene/methyl vinyl silicone rubber (Cu/LDPE/MVQ) composite in rhesus macaques.
   Study design: Healthy reproductive aged female rhesus macaques underwent abdominal hysterotomy for surgical placement of either the experimental Cu/LDPE/MVQcomposite (Cu/LDPE/MVQ n=5), bare copper wire (Cu, n=5), or hysterotomy only sham-operation group [(SOI, n=4), (SOII, n=6)]. Females in the Cu/LPDE/MVQ, Cu, and SOI groups were housed with fertile males for approximately three menstrual cycles. We assessed pregnancy by hysterectomy. Females in the Cu/LDPE/MVQ, Cu, and SOII groups underwent hysterectomy at about 4 months post-insertion for histologic assessment of morphologic changes of the endometrium, evaluation of materials using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and evaluation of the inflammatory markers, including substance P receptor (SPR), associated with endometrial bleeding using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses.
   Results: All of the SOI group females became pregnant (4/4,100%). In contrast, no pregnancies occurred in either the Cu/LDPE/MVQ (0/5, 0%) or Cu (0/5, 0%) groups. We observed histologic features consistent with chronic endometrial inflammation in all females of the Cu group, but none of the SOII or Cu/LDPE/MVQ animals. Levels of inflammatory markers were significantly increased in the Cu group, compared with SOIL or Cu/LDPE/MVQ groups (p<.05). SEM showed evidence of corrosion in the Cu wire not seen in the Cu/LDPE/MVQ group.
   Conclusion(s): Cu/LDPE/MVQ material provided a contraceptive effect similar to Cu in macaques, with a lower impact on inflammation and inflammatory markers of the endometrium. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective(s): We explored the relationship between Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), pregnancy intention and contraceptive use in Honduras.
   Study design: We used the most recent Honduras Demographic and Health Survey (DHS 2011-2012) data to examine the relationship between physical IPV, sexual IPV and emotional IPV with pregnancy intention; contraceptive use; and husband's knowledge of contraceptive use among a sample of 6629 women. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate effects of IPV on the outcomes, controlling for empowerment indicators and socio-demographic variables.
   Results: Among currently married women with at least one living child born within the past 5 years, IPV was significantly associated with several outcomes. Women reporting any physical IPV (13.5%) were less likely to have wanted their last child (aOR: 0.52, p<.001) or to desire future children (aOR: 0.76, p=.002), and more likely to have ever used contraception (aOR: 2.32 p=.004). Those reporting physical with sexual violence (4.1%) were less likely to have wanted their last child (aOR: 0.59, p=.016). Women reporting emotional IPV (27.4%) were less likely to have wanted their last child (aOR: 0.56, p<.001) or to desire more children (aOR: 0.81, p<.001) and more likely to have ever used (aOR: 1.78, p<.001) and currently be using contraception (aOR: 1.19, p=.006).
   Conclusion(s): IPV was associated with both unwanted pregnancy and increased contraceptive use among married Honduran women. Universal screening for IPV among women who seek SRH services in Honduras may help identify women in need and reduce stigma around IPV while improving SRH outcomes.

TI "Provoked" feto-maternal hemorrhage may represent insensible cell
   exchange in pregnancies from 6 to 22 weeks gestational age

AB Objective: To quantify spontaneous and provoked fetal to maternal cell exchange in the first half of pregnancy. Transfer of fetal red blood cells (FRBCs) into the maternal circulation during the first half of pregnancy is poorly characterized but of clinical relevance for miscarriage management and invasive procedures.
   Study design: Prospective, descriptive cohort study of women presenting for surgical termination of pregnancy with sonographically confirmed gestational age (GA). Pre-procedural and post-procedural blood samples were collected to characterize both spontaneous (pre) and provoked (post) cell exchange with analysis via flow cytometry to quantify FRBC count.
   Results: A total of 100 patients at 6-22 weeks GA contributed 200 matched pre- and post-procedural samples. FRBCs were identified in 69 patients including 4 who exhibited FRBCs pre-procedure only and 9 postprocedure only, for a total of 65 patients having post-procedural FRBCs. Of patients with FRBCs following their procedure, the majority (n=56, 86%) also exhibited evidence of cells before the procedure with just 9 patients (14%) exhibiting FRBCs only after. No dose-response relationship was appreciable between GA and FRBC count.
   Conclusion: After experiencing disruption of the placenta with instrumentation, roughly two thirds of patients had detectable FRBCs in maternal circulation following their procedure but among those that did the majority also exhibited cell presence prior to the procedure. This leads to further questions regarding the relationship between risk events and alloimmunization potential in previable pregnancies as the rate of spontaneous transplacental cell exchange may be underappreciated and the magnitude of provoked transfer may be overestimated.

ID UNINTENDED PREGNANCY; UNPLANNED PREGNANCY; WOMEN; PREVENTION; HEALTH
AB Objective: To measure the association of military branch-specific contraceptive education and access policy during basic training with contraceptive use and childbirth among new recruits.
   Study design: Secondary analysis of insurance records from 92,072 active duty servicewomen who started basic training between 2013 and 2017.
   Results: Exposure to reproductive health education and access to contraception during basic training differ by military branch. Highly effective contraception use (pills, patch, ring, shot, implants or intrauterine contraception) at 6 months on active duty [Army (18.1%), Air Force (27.4%), Marines (26.5%) and Navy (37.6%), p<.001], long-acting reversible contraceptive method use (implant or intrauterine) at 6 months [Army (2.0%), Air Force (3.7%), Marines (11.0%) and Navy (19.6%), p<.001] and childbirth in the first 24 months of service [Army (11.1%, 95% CI 10.7-11.5), Air Force (6.0%, 95% CI 5.6-6.4), Marines (8.4%, 95% CI 7.8-9.0) and Navy (6.7%, 95% CI 6.3-7.1)] varied by service branch. After adjusting for age at basic training and contraceptive use at 6 months on active duty, childbirth rates differed among all branches. The Army (hazard ratio 1.86, 95% CI 1.71-2.01), Marines (1.48, 95% CI 1.33-1.65) and Navy (124, 95% CI 1.13-1.35) all had a higher risk of delivery than the Air Force.
   Conclusion: Variation in branch-specific contraceptive education and access policy during basic training is associated with differences in rates of contraceptive use at 6 months on active duty and childbirth prior to 24 months on active duty. This occurs despite all recruits having access to an identical medical benefit including no-cost access to contraception after completing initial training. Further study is needed to determine the etiology of these differences. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Hospital in 2017
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Postpartum; Contraception; Education; Lactation; LARC; Nursing
AB Objective: To describe contraceptive knowledge and counseling practices of postpartum nurses.
   Methods: We surveyed postpartum nurses at the largest women's hospital in Rhode Island.
   Results: We distributed 117 anonymous questionnaires and received 58 responses (response rate=50%). Twenty-three of 51 nurses (45%) reported routinely offering contraceptive advice to new mothers. Only 5/55 (9%) responded correctly that combined hormonal contraceptives were an "unacceptable health risk" in the immediate postpartum period. A minority of respondents correctly classified the progestin-only pill, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, the etonogestrel implant, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system and the copper intrauterine device as safe to use during lactation [14/56 (25%), 24/56 (43%), 27/56 (48%), 19/55 (35%) and 9/55 (16%), respectively]. Thirty-three of 51 nurses (65%) incorrectly responded that depot medroxyprogesterone acetate decreases milk supply if started immediately postpartum.
   Conclusion: There are opportunities to improve knowledge regarding contraceptive safety and impact on lactation among postpartum nurses at our institution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate short-term adverse perinatal outcomes and long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations through 18 years of age in offspring conceived during copper intrauterine device (IUD) use.
   Study design: We conducted a population-based cohort study comparing the pregnancy outcomes after 22 weeks of women who conceived with a copper IUD that was removed, women with a retained IUD and pregnancies without an IUD. Deliveries occurred between the years 1991 and 2014. We used a multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression model analysis to control for confounders and for maternal clusters, a Kaplan-Meier survival curve to compare cumulative neuropsychiatric hospitalizations incidence and a Cox proportional-hazards model to evaluate long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations.
   Results: During the study period there were 221,805 deliveries, of which 203 (0.09%) and 149 (0.06%) occurred in patients with removed or retained copper IUD, respectively. Using GEE models, preterm delivery was independently associated with copper IUD use [odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-3.2 and OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.7 for removed and retained IUD, respectively]. We did not find an association between copper IUD presence or removal and the offspring's long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations (total long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations: 2.5%, 4.4% and 3.2% for removed, retained and no IUD, respectively, p=.71). Longterm neuropsychiatric hospitalization rate was comparable between the groups (Kaplan-Meier survival curve log rank p=.23).
   Conclusion: Pregnancies in women who conceive with a removed or retained copper IUD are at an increased risk for short-term adverse perinatal outcomes, especially preterm delivery. For pregnancies that continued to at least 22 weeks, we found no benefit in IUD removal. However, the risk of long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations is not increased among offspring of these women. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English

DE Medical abortion; Misoprostol; Self-managed abortion; Provider
   attitudes; Telemedicine
AB Objective: Data on the practice of self-managed medication abortion are limited, in part because this practice takes place purposefully outside of established healthcare systems. Given this, we aimed to ascertain abortion providers' familiarity with self-managed medication abortion and associated complications, compare regional differences and evaluate provider attitudes.
   Study design: We distributed an online survey to members of Society for Family Planning, Association of Reproductive Health Providers and the Abortion Care Network between July and September 2017 querying experiences with and opinions about self-managed abortion.
   Results: Of 650 respondents, 359 (55.1%) were direct abortion providers. Two hundred and thirty of 335 providers (68.6%) had experience with women trying to interrupt pregnancies on their own, and of those, 153 (76.1%) had seen use of misoprostol and/or mifepristone, and 204 of 342 (59.6%) thought this practice increased in the past 5 years. One hundred and seventeen of 335 (34.9%), witnessed complications from self-managed abortion with misoprostol/mifepristone, most commonly incomplete abortion and less often hemorrhage, sepsis and uterine rupture. Half of providers, 171 of 321 (53.3%), think that the use of misoprostol/mifepristone for the self management of abortion is safe.
   Conclusion: Two thirds of respondents had experiences with women attempting to self-manage abortion, and about a third witnessed complications related to self-managed medication abortion. About half of respondents agreed that self-managed abortion is safe. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We sought to examine women's experiences with immediate postpartum LARC counseling and use in the context of South Carolina's Medicaid policy.
   Study design: In 2016-18, we conducted semi-structured individual interviews with 25 women, ages 18-35, who gave birth within 2 years of the interview in South Carolina while insured by Medicaid and received contraceptive counseling about immediate postpartum [ARC during their pregnancies. We analyzed the interviews using a combination of deductive and inductive coding approaches.
   Results: Participants were counseled on immediate postpartum [ARC during prenatal care (n=23) and/or while in the hospital for childbirth (n=16). Some expressed dissatisfaction with providers' approaches to contraceptive counseling because they either did not receive enough information to make a fully informed decision or felt they were being pressured to use LARC. Among those who received in-hospital contraceptive counseling, some objected to the timing because they were in labor and/or already had a non-LARC postpartum contraceptive plan. Three out of the 10 participants who elected to receive immediate postpartum [ARC later desired removal but encountered barriers.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest providers' timing, style, and content of contraceptive counseling about immediate postpartum LARC may not be sufficiently patient-centered. Additionally, lack of access to unfettered LARC removal limits patients' reproductive autonomy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

ID STROMAL CELLS; EXPRESSION; GENE; PROMOTE; DELIVERY
AB Background. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are considered good candidates for seed cells in bone engineering. The study aim to investigate the synergistic effects of human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (hBMP2) and transforming growth factor beta3 (hTGF-beta3) modified BMSCs on inducing osteogenic differentiation in vitro.
   Methods: Lentivirus (LV) carrying hBMP2 and/or hTGF-beta3 genes were constructed and used to transduce rat BMSCs. The expression of osteogenic molecules was detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting.
   Results: Targeted genes were PCR-amplified and confirmed by DNA sequencing and BLAST analysis. BMSCs infected by vectors effectively resulted in the overexpressions of hBMP2 and hTGF-beta3 and higher levels of hBMP2 and hTGF-beta3 in the culture supernatant. The co-transduction of hBMP2 and hTGF-beta3 induced BMSCs osteogenic differentiation more effectively than the transduction of hBMP2 or hTGF-beta3 individually. The expression levels of osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in LV-hBMP2 + LV-hTGF-beta3 group (BMSCs transfected by vectors respectively carrying hBMP-2 gene and hTGF-beta3 gene) and LV-hBMP2-hTGF-beta3 group (BMSCs transfected by vector carrying hBMP2 and hTGF-beta3 fusion gene) were significantly higher than in LV-BMP2 (BMSCs transfected by vector carrying hBMP2 gene) and LV-TGF-beta3 (BMSCs transfected by vector carrying hTGF-beta3 gene) groups (P < 0.05). The hBMP2 and/or hTGF-beta3 overexpression upregulated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity.
   Conclusion: The present study showed that hBMP2 and/or hTGF-beta3 genes can be successfully overexpressed in BMSCs. Our study proved that the two cytokines (hBMP2 and hTGF-beta3) could induce bone differentiation synergistically, which foresees the use of the combination of these two cytokines as a therapeutic strategy in the future.

AB Introduction. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high risk of death mainly due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Early risk identification may allow interventions and prevention of fatal events.
   Objectives: The study aim was to assess the usefulness of selected CVD biomarkers as predictors of 5-year mortality in patients with different CKD stages.
   Patients and Methods: Study included 57 CKD patients: 38 in stage 5 (ESRD), 19 in stage 3 and 4 (CKD3-4), and 19 healthy controls. Blood samples were obtained once to measure fetuin A, adiponectin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), intracellular-1 (ICAM1) and vascular-1 (VCAM1) adhesion molecules (ELISA or LumMex platform). Computed tomography was performed to assess the calcium score (CS). Patients were prospectively followed for 5 years to evaluate their all-cause mortality.
   Results: Serum VCAM1, TNF and IL-6 were significantly higher in more advanced CKD stages. VCAM1 correlated significantly with ICAM1, TNF and IL-6. TNF and IL-6 were also significantly correlated with each other. No significant changes were detected for other markers. IL-6 correlated significantly with CS, age, renal function and CRP. Elevated CS and IL-6 increased over 3 times the 5-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks in patients with CKD or ESRD at baseline.
   Conclusions: IL-6 and CS were significantly associated with 5-year risk of all-cause mortality in CKD patients. Our study suggests an involvement of chronic inflammation linked to coronary artery calcification that is likely to contribute to the cardiovascular mortality in patients with impaired renal function.

AB Orf is a contagious disease posing a serious threat to animal and human health. E3L is one of the evolutionarily acquired immunomodulatory proteins present in orf virus (ORFV) and is responsible for conferring resistance to interferons among poxviruses. Genetic analysis of ORFV isolates of different geographical regions including Indian subcontinent targeting viral interferon resistance (VIR) gene (a homolog of vaccinia virus E3L gene) revealed a high percentage of identity among themselves and other ORFV isolates at both nt and as levels as compared to low identity among parapoxviruses (PPVs). Phylogenetic analysis showed species-specific clustering among PPVs along with sub-clusters based on host species of origin among OREVs infecting sheep and goats. Conserved amino acids in N-terminal Z-DNA binding domain and C-terminal ds RNA binding domain of VIR proteins of PPVs corresponding to ORFV VIR positions namely N37, Y41, P57, and W59 (necessary for Z-DNA binding) and E116, F127, F141, and K160 (necessary for dsRNA binding) were found. Further, the predicted protein characteristics and homology model of VIR protein of ORFV showed high structural conservation among poxviruses. This study on E3L genetic analysis of ORFV isolates may provide a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of circulating strains in India and neighboring countries. Also, E3L deleted or mutated ORFV may be an as vaccine candidate and/or compounds blocking E3L may prove as an effective method for treating broad spectrum poxviral infections, suggesting a wider application in control of poxvirus infections.

AB Purpose: Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection and a syndrome shaped by pathogen and host factors with characteristic that evolve over time. The study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic and discriminative value of IL-18 assessment in comparison to PCT, CRP, WBC in early stage of sepsis and septic shock.
   Methods: An observational and prospective study was conducted in the group of 40 ICU patients with diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock, serum PCT, IL-18, CRP and WBC measurements were performed on admission, and on the 2nd, 3rd and 5th therapy day. The level of IL-18 was determined with commercially available test according to manufacturer's protocol.
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences in IL-18 levels in survivors vs non-survivors and in sepsis vs septic shock subgroups the IL-18 levels were statistically significant in the course of the study except for the 5th day.
   Conclusion: The PCT, CRP and WBC levels revealed no significant differences between any analyzed subgroups in all time points during study. According to our results the IL-18 is a biomarker better differentiating sepsis and septic shock status than PCT, CRP and WBC but with no prognostic impact.

AB Viperin is an interferon-inducible protein that helps in protecting mammals against various virus infections. Viperin is a highly conserved member of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) family in many species. Viperin has been shown to play a pivotal role in the innate immunity of chicken; however, its role has not been explored in its antiviral potential. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is the causative agent of an infectious disease in poultry. In the present study, we have shown the anti-NDV effect of chicken viperin (cViperin). The impact of cViperin upon NDV infection was investigated in chicken embryo fibroblast. The modeling of the cViperin protein was done using I-TASSER and ZDOCK is used to predict the possible interaction with the matrix protein of NDV. The interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay using recombinant matrix protein of NDV with the recombinant cViperin. The recombinant NDV expressing cViperin showed reduced replication of the virus upon its growth kinetics. Our results suggest downregulation of NDV replication in the presence of cViperin. The study will be critical to elaborate our understanding of the chicken innate immune system which could help develop antiviral strategies against NDV infection.

   suppressing hippocampal neuroinflammation in mice

AB Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after surgery and its occurrence is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the pathophysiology of this complication remains largely unknown. Efforts to identify causes of POCD have focused on the hippocampal neuroinflammation. Recently, accumulated evidence indicates that NeurimmiRs, a subset of microRNAs (miRNAs), which modulate both neuronal and immune processes, play an important role in neuroinflammation. However, the impact of NeurimmiRs on POCD has not been investigated. We hypothesized that NeurimmiRs is involved in surgery-induced cognitive impairment in adult mice via mediating hippocampal neuroinflammation.
   Methods: MicroRNA(miR)-181b-5p was found to be downregulated in the hippocampi of mice with POCD using microRNA array, which was also verified in vivo in the mouse model of POCD by Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Subsequently, the expression of miR-181b-5p was measured in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated BV-2 microglial cells and hippocampal tissues of the mice with POCD. Then, loss of function and overexpression studies were performed by transfection with miR-181b-5p mimic/inhibitor in cultured BV-2 cell lines and intrahippocampal injection of miR-181b-5p agomir before Surgery/Anesthesia, to identify the role of miR-181b-5p in neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments. QPCR, western blot and ELISA were used to determine the expression of proinflammatory mediators. Immunofluorescence staining was applied to evaluate the activation of microglia. Furthermore, we used bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase assay to predict and verify the potential target of miR-181b-5p.
   Results: The results indicated that miR-181b-5p mimic could repress the mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells, while the miR-18113-5p inhibitor induced upregulation of the above-mentioned proinflammatory factors. Further bioinformatics analysis showed that miR181b-5p was predicted to potentially target the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of TNF-alpha, and binding sites of miR181b-5p in the 3'-UTR of TNF-alpha were identified by dual-luciferase assay. Importantly, injecting miR-18111-5p agomir into the hippocampus of mice before surgery, ameliorated the hippocampus-dependent memory, and was accompanied by downregulation of proinflammatory factors expression and reduced microglial activation in the hippocampus of POCD mice.
   Conclusions: Collectively, these findings suggest that miR-181b-5p attenuates early POCD by suppressing hippocampal neuroinflammation in mice. They also highlight the importance of studying miRNAs in the context of POCD and identify miR-181b-5p as a novel potential therapeutic target for improving POCD.

AB Objective: Determination of antibodies to infliximab (ATI) is desirable for the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who receive infliximab. Conventional ligand-binding ATI-assays detect only free-form of ATI, potentially increasing the proportion of patients with undetectable ATI, but with adequate trough infliximab (TRI) level who experience loss of response (LOR) to infliximab. We investigated this assertion using a novel ATI-Cim assay.
   Methods: An ATI-Cim assay was developed by utilizing a C1q-immobilized plate, detecting free-form and ATI-infliximab complexes. Plasma ATI in 137 consecutive IBD patients, 56 with sustained clinical response (SCR), 76 with LOR and 5 with infusion reactions was measured.
   Results: ATI levels reached a plateau following addition of up to 25 mu g/mL infliximab to different concentrations of free-form ATI. ATI concentration did not significantly change during infliximab infusion (P = 0.4316). ATI concentration > 0.153 mu g/mL was associated with LOR (odds ratio 3.0: 95%, confidence interval 1.5 to 6.1, P = 0.0029). The number of patients with undetectable ATI was higher in SCR than in LOR, 53.6% vs 22.4% (P = 0.0004). Patients with SCR and LOR were divided into 4 subgroups by combined cut-off ATI and TRI values. (A) ATI > 0.153 mu g/mL and TRI <= 2 mu g/mL; (B) ATI > 0.153 mu g/mL and TRI > 2 mu g/mL; (C) ATI <= 0.153 mu g/mL and TRI <= 2 mu g/mL; (D) ATI <= 0.153 mu g/mL and TRI > 21.1 mu g/mL. The frequency of LOR showed a decreasing trend from subgroup A to D, 80.8%, 64.1%, 55.2% and 36.8%, respectively (P = 0.0003).
   Conclusions: The measured ATI level appeared to define the patients' response to infliximab. Combining ATI and trough infliximab levels should help to understand the mechanism of LOR and make therapeutic algorithms.

AB Salivary biomarkers represent a promising diagnostic tool. Non-invasive and stress-free sampling results in objective parameters able to overcome the need of clinical expertise required for a correct interpretation of early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The present study aims at evaluating potential variations in the salivary concentration of cytokines in presence of OSCC.
   Twenty patients who underwent surgical resection of OSCC were enrolled in order to assess the variation of the salivary concentration of cytokines and chemokines in a longitudinal prospective case-crossover setting. The salivary concentration of 27 salivary cytokines/chemokines was assessed before and after surgical resection of OSCC. In cases of relapsing/recurrent disease further assessments were performed.
   In presence of OSCC an increased concentration of IL-8(p = 0.004), IL-6(p = 0.005), VEGF(p = 0.014), MIP-1 beta(p = 0.033), IP-10(p = 0.047), IL-1 beta(p = 0.049) was observed; conversely the concentration of IFN-gamma(p = 0.036) and IL-5(P = 0.048) decreased. In cases with relapsing/recurrent disease IL-5, IL-6 and MIP-1 beta showed variations consistent with the previously reported results.
   Further studies are needed in order to confirm these results and to determine reference values to determine the presence or absence of disease.

AB Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by exacerbated inflammation, which is implicated in cardiometabolic dysfunction. This study aimed to examine the potential effects of acute exercise on inflammatory responses in obese/overweight PCOS women and their controls. Participants underwent a single bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (30 min at similar to 65% of VO2peak). Blood and muscle samples were collected immediately before (PRE) and 60 min after the exercise session. Cytokines (i.e., IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-alpha) were measured both in plasma and in skeletal muscle, and proteins related to inflammatory signaling (IKK alpha/beta and JNK) were assessed in skeletal muscle. At PRE, PCOS showed elevated muscle TNF-alpha (+62%, p = 0.0012) and plasma IL-1 beta (+76%, p = 0.0010) compared to controls. In PCOS, exercise decreased plasma and muscle TNF-alpha (-14%, p = 0.0003 and -46%, p = 0.0003), as well as increased plasma and muscle IL-4 (+147%, p = 0.0018 and +62%, p = 0.0474) and plasma IL-10 (+38%, p = 0.0029). Additionally, IKK alpha/beta and JNK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle, which was higher in PCOS at PRE, was significantly reduced by exercise (-58%, p < 0.0001 and -46%, p < 0.0001, respectively), approaching control levels. Person's correlations between PRE values and delta changes (i.e., exercise effect) showed significant, negative associations for plasma IL-1 beta (r = -0.92, p < 0.0001), TNF-alpha (r = -0.72, p = 0.0100) and IL-6 (r = -0.58, p = 0.05), and muscle INF-alpha (r = -0.95, p < 0.0001), IKK alpha/beta (r = -0.75, p = 0.005), and JNK (r = -0.94, p < 0.0001) in PCOS. In conclusion, exercise can mitigate the inflammatory milieu in women with PCOS. The anti-inflammatory role of exercise could underlie its cardiometabolic protection in PCOS.

DE Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry; Escherichia coli bloodstream infection; Serum peptide
   profiling; New biomarkers
AB Background: Bacterial bloodstream infection (BSI) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, which is a widespread and uncontrolled inflammatory response. There are some cytokines for the auxiliary diagnosis, such as procalcitonin (PCT), C reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which are not sufficient. This study was aimed to explore a new method of diagnosing bacterial BSI and to find some new biomarkers that could differentiate bloodstream infected patients from healthy people.
   Methods: An animal model was used to find relevant changes of peptides in the serum and was validated in clinical samples. Mice (25-27 g) were randomized to infection with Escherichia coil ATCC25922 or phosphate buffer saline. The serum samples were purified by weak cation exchange beads and the serum peptide profiling was established by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Statistical analysis and diagnostic modeling were conducted on BioExplorer. Amino acid sequences of the candidate peptides were identified by nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and relevant proteins were recognized on the Uniprot database. The identified proteins were confirmed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on clinical samples.
   Results: Five peptide peaks (m/z 1941, 2924.1, 3962.1, 4126.9 and 5514) were found as candidate biomarkers for E. coil infection, and the diagnostic model discriminated E. coil infected patients from healthy controls with an accuracy of 92.2%. Peptide peaks m/z 1941, 2924.1 and 4126.9 were identified as the fragments of Serotransferrin (TRF), Complement C3 and Serum amyloid A-1 protein (SAA1), respectively, but only C3 and SAA1 showed significant difference in clinical samples.
   Conclusion: MALDI-TOF MS could be a new method to find the changes of serum peptides after infection, C3 and SAA1 could be new biomarkers in diagnosing BSI.

AB Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a cytokine that is composed of the subunits p19 and p40, while its receptor (IL-23R) consists of two subunits, that is, IL-23R alpha and IL-12R beta 1. The interaction between IL-23 and IL-23R is necessary for exerting cardinal biological effects upon certain cell types, including promotion of memory T cell proliferation and Th17 cell-mediated IL-17 secretion. Accordingly, dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the main sources for IL-23 secretion. Interestingly, IL-23R is also present on the DC plasma membrane, suggesting that IL-23 potentially acts on DCs via an autocrine manner. In this review, we have summarized a variety of IL-23-mediated effects on the intracellular signaling pathways such as Janus kinase 2, tyrosine kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and so forth, which may underlie numerous processes such as DC maturation, antigen presentation, T cell proliferation/activation, and cytokine secretion, which may be implicated in many immune-related diseases through IL-23/DC interactions. Accordingly, these signaling pathways are extensively involved in the pathogenesis and progression of numerous diseases, including autoimmune disease (e.g., atopic dermatitis, asthma, and multiple sclerosis) and infection (e.g., bacterial, fungal, and viral infections). Taken together, they are potentially applicable to novel but promising strategies for treating numerous diseases associated with the mutual attachment of IL-23 and DCs.

AB Objective: This study was designed to assess the impact on outcomes of early soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand concentrations (sFLc) in patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
   Methods: This was a prospective monocentric study including all allo-HSCT patients included in the previous FLAM/FLAL study (Peterlin et al., 2019). Blood samples collected before the start of conditioning then post-transplant were frozen, stored and tested by ELISA. The parameters considered were hematopoietic recoveries, Leukemia Free Survival and Overall Survival, acute and chronic GVHD, grade 3 or 4 acute and/or extensive chronic GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS).
   Results: Forty-one patients were included, a total of 179 samples were assayed for sFLc. There was no impact of sFLc levels (< = median vs > median) on acute and chronic GVHD incidences, LFS, OS nor GRFS.
   Conclusion: At variance with induction results for AML (Peterlin et al., 2019) endogenous sFLc do not appear to be a prognostic marker at the time of or after allo-HSCT. Even though the results are negatives, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the only prospective series specifically addressing the question of sFLc impact after allo-HSCT in acute leukemias.

AB Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTL) are responsible for inhibiting lipoprotein lipase activity, and ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 deficiencies have been shown to lower lipoprotein levels in animal models and in humans carrying loss-of-function mutations. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary hemolytic anemia characterized by vaso-occlusive crises and end-organ damage, which is curiously associated with hypocholesterolemia and a low incidence of atherosclerosis, whose underlying mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesized that ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 dysregulation is responsible for the hypolipidemic phenotype in SCA. We measured circulating concentrations of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 and correlated them with hemolytic biomarkers and lipoproteins in 40 patients with SCA and 30 control individuals. The association between hemolysis and low cholesterol levels in SCA was confirmed along with surprisingly higher levels of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 in SCA patients than in controls. ANGPTL3 correlated with hemolysis markers LDH and reticulocyte counts, while ANGPTL4 did not. Our data show a paradoxical increase in production of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 in SCA, which would be expected to cause hyperlipidemia, due to increased inhibition of lipoprotein lipase. ANGPTL3, exclusively produced by the liver, correlated with hemolysis markers, suggesting a possible hepatic response to hemolysis. Further functional studies and replication in larger cohorts are warranted to investigate the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in SCA.

AB Persistent infection by high-risk oncogenic human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer and its precursor lesions, and both the systemic and local immunological responses play an important role in eliminating or maintenance this infection. Th17 cells, as well as interleukin (IL)-17, are related to tumor growth and persistence of viral infection. Thus, this study aimed to quantify IL-17 in the serum and exfoliated cervical cells of HR-HPV-infected patients and healthy patients as well as identify CD4(+)1L17(+) cells and IL-17 production in uterine cervix biopsies to better understand the behavior of this cytokine in HPV infections. IL-17 was quantified (pg/mL) in the serum and exfoliated cervical cells of 26 HR-HPV-infected patients, and in 18 healthy patients, using flow cytometry. Fifteen paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from the uterine cervix were subjected to immunohistochemistry to detect CD4(+)IL-17(+) and IL-17(+) cells. There was a significant increase in the concentration of IL-17 in HR-HPV-positive patients' serum when compared to that in samples of exfoliated cervical cells (p < 0.05). Likewise, when compared with that in healthy patients, the IL-17 concentration was still higher in HR-HPV-positive patients sera (p < 0.05). We did not find differences in the amount of CD4(+)IL-17(+) cells and other IL-17-secreting cells between different histopathological lesions. Our results suggest that HR-HPV infection predominantly stimulates systemic IL-17 production along with less localized expression.

AB The role of myostatin (MSTN) in the regulation of energy homeostasis has been known and that MSTN inhibition can attenuate the development of diabetes. However, the response of MSTN to exercise in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the alteration of MSTN following aerobic exercise training in diabetic rats and its possible interaction with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and inflammatory cytokines. Forty-eight male Wistar rats were divided into non-diabetic untrained, non-diabetic trained, diabetic untrained and diabetic trained groups. To induce T1DM, rats received an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg.kg(-1)). Treadmill exercise was performed for six weeks, five days/week. HbA1c was estimated, MSTN mRNA expression in skeletal muscle was measured, and plasma MSTN and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) were determined. Results revealed a significant decrease of HbA1c and plasma inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) followed by a significant decrease of plasma and skeletal muscle MSTN in diabetic trained rats versus non-diabetic untrained and diabetic untrained rats after the experimental period. Moreover, in diabetic untrained and diabetic trained rats, a significantly positive correlation (change versus change) of plasma MSTN with HbA1c and plasma IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was found. In conclusion, this study indicated that aerobic exercise training by a decrease of HbA1c and plasma IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta could decrease MSTN levels in plasma and skeletal muscle in T1DM. Furthermore, the effective influence of exercise may be reflected by changes of MSTN in diabetic rats.

AB While a plethora of studies have been conducted to investigate the associations between pro-inflammatory cytokines and obesity, the inter-relationship between pro-inflammatory cytokines and intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) has been poorly investigated. In the present study, circulating levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) were measured in 90 individuals after acute pancreatitis (AP) as well as 21 healthy non-obese individuals. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify IPFD and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat volume ratio by two independent raters. Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations between IPFD and each cytokine, adjusting for demographic, metabolic, and pancreatitis-related factors, as well as abdominal fat distribution. In healthy non-obese individuals, IPFD was not significantly associated with any of the studied cytokines in both the unadjusted and adjusted models. In individuals after AP, IPFD was significantly associated with leptin in the models adjusted for age and sex (beta = 0.063 [95% confidence interval: 0.007, 0.119], P = 0.026); age, sex, visceral-to subcutaneous fat volume ratio, glycated hemoglobin, and pancreatitis-related factors (beta = 0.056 [95% confidence interval: 0.000, 0.111], P = 0.049). Also, IPFD was significantly associated with TNF alpha in the unadjusted model (beta = 0.102 [95% confidence interval: 0.002, 0.202], P = 0.045) and the model adjusted for age, sex, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat volume ratio, glycated hemoglobin, and pancreatitis-related factors (beta = 0.128 [95% confidence interval: 0.034, 0.223], P = 0.008). The associations between IPFD and IL-6, CCL2 were not statistically significant, in both the unadjusted and adjusted models. These findings indicate that leptin and TNF alpha are associated with IPFD independent of abdominal fat distribution and other covariates in individuals after AP. The role of IPFD in low-grade inflammation warrants further investigations.

AB Host innate immune system is critical for combating invading microbes including Influenza A virus (IAV). As an important arm of the innate immunity, the NLRP3 inflammasome has been found essential for protecting host against IAV challenge, while the mechanism remained elusive. Here we found that mice carrying a gain-of-function mutation in the Nlrp3 gene (Nlrp3(R258W)) are strongly resistant to IAV infection. Upon H1N1 IAV infection, the Nlrp3(R258W) mice exhibited decreased weight loss, increased survival rate and attenuated lung damage compared with WT littermate controls. Mechanistically, the resistance of Nlrp3(R258W) mice to IAV infection was dependent on IL-1 beta-mediated neutrophil recruitment. Upon IAV infection, mice carrying the Nlrp3(R258W) mutation produced more IL-1 beta than WT mice in the lung, which enhanced neutrophil recruitment locally. The recruited neutrophils facilitated IAV clearance, so that the viral load in Nlrp3(R258W) mice was lower than that in control mice. Conversely, neutrophil depletion in Nlrp3(R258w) mice compromised IAV clearance. Taken together, our results demonstrate a previously undescribed mechanism by which hyperactivation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome protects mice from IAV infection through IL-1 beta mediated neutrophil recruitment, thus suggest that positively fine tuning the physiological function of NLRP3 inflammasome can be beneficial for a mammalian host against IAV challenge.

AB Background: We previously reported that the cytokine profiles in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of IgG4-related respiratory disease (IgG4-RRD) more closely resemble the T-helper (Th) 2 response than sarcoidosis. The present study aimed to assess the chemokines in the BALF of IgG4-RRD and sarcoidosis in order to evaluate any possible associations between these chemokines and other markers.
   Methods: We examined 12 chemokines using a MILLIPLEX (R) MAP Kit (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) in the same BALF samples of the same 44 patients (IgG4-RRD, n = 11; sarcoidosis, n = 33) in which we had previously evaluated the cytokines.
   Results: The levels of CC-chemokine ligand (CCL)26 in the BALF of IgG4-RRD patients (median 24.5, range 3.1-401.1 pg/mL) were significantly higher than those in the BALF of sarcoidosis patients (median 3.1, range 3.1-155.6 pg/mL, p < 0.05). Interestingly, the BALF levels of CCL1 in the sarcoidosis patients (median 13.1, range 0.1-106.9 pg/mL) were significantly higher than those of the IgG4-RRD patients (median 9.8, range 0.1-14.7 pg/mL, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the CCL1 levels in the BALF were correlated with the total cell count (rho = 0.539, p < 0.001), lymphocyte fraction (R = 0.406, P < 0.05), lymphocyte count (R = 0.686, P < 0.001), TNF-alpha level, (R = 0.748, P < 0.001), and IL-2 level (R = 0.757, P < 0.001) in the BALF of sarcoidosis patients.
   Conclusions: CCL1 might reflect disease activity and its involvement in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis might be more closely related to Th1 than to Th2.

AB Aims: Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 lies at the convergence point of key pathways involved in many malignancies including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and the unfolded protein response have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different cancers by influencing key cellular processes such as apoptosis. We investigated the differential expression of STAT3 pathway-related genes and proteins under ERS in OSCC.
   Methods: Three normal oral keratinocyte (NOK) and three OSCC cell lines were subjected to tunicamycin to induce ERS for 24 h or to the vehicle medium as control. A pathway-focussed array was used to analyse the modulation of STAT3 pathway gene expression under ERS using qPCR. The expression of key regulated proteins was investigated in the cell lines using immunocytochemistry and in 76 OSCC and 9 normal oral mucosa (NOM) tissue samples using tissue microarray technology and immunohistochemistry.
   Results: ERS resulted in up-regulation of interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) gene in NOK cell lines (p = 0.001) and IL5 (p = 0.005) and IL22 (p = 0.024) in OSCC cell lines. Greater STAT3 (p = 0.019) and leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (p = 0.042) protein expression was observed in treated than untreated NOK cell lines.
   Conclusions: The gene and protein regulation patterns show that ERS plays a role in modifying the tumour microenvironment in OSCC by up-regulating tumour-promoting cytokines.

AB The immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from autologous and allogeneic sources are useful in stimulating tissue regeneration and repair. To obtain a high number of MSCs for transplantation requires extensive in vitro expansion with culture media supplements that can cause xeno-contamination of cells potentially compromising function and clinical outcomes. In this study stem cells from human extracted deciduous teeth (SHED) were cultured in Knockout (TM) DMEM supplemented with either pooled human serum (pHS) or foetal bovine serum (FBS) to compare their suitability in maintaining immunomodulatory properties of cells during in vitro expansion. No significant difference in cell survival of SHED grown in pHS (pHS-SHED) or FBS (FBS-SHED) was observed when co-cultured with complement, monocytes or lymphocytes. However, significant changes in the expression of sixteen paracrine factors involved in immunomodulation were observed in the supernatants of FBS-SHED co-cultures with monocytes or lymphocytes compared to that in pHS-SHEDs after both 24 and 120 h of incubation. Further analysis of changing protein levels of paracrine factors in co-cultures using biological pathway analysis software predicted upregulation of functions associated with immunogenicity in FBS-SHED and lymphocyte co-cultures compared to pHS-SHED co-cultures. Pathway analysis also predicted significant stimulation of HMGB1 and TREM1 signalling pathways in FBS-SHED co-cultures indicating activation of immune cells and inflammation. Though FBS supplementation does not impact survival of SHED, our combinatorial biological pathway analysis supports the idea that in vitro expansion of SHEDs in pHS provides optimal conditions to minimise xeno-contamination and inflammation and maintain their immunomodulatory properties.

AB Breast cancer incidence and metastasis in postmenopausal women are known to associate with obesity, but the molecular mechanisms behind this association are largely unknown. We investigated the effect of adipokine resistin on epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness in breast cancer cells in vitro. Previous reports demonstrated that the inflammatory actions of resistin are mediated by the adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), which serves as its receptor. As a model for our study, we used MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and MCF-10A breast epithelial cells. We showed that in MCF-7 cells resistin increases the migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and induces the formation of cellular protrusions through reorganization of F-actin filaments. Resistin upregulated the expression of mesenchymal markers involved in EMT (SNAIL, SLUG, ZEB1, TWIST1, fibronectin, and vimentin), and downregulated those of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and claudin-1). Resistin also potentiated the nuclear translocation of SNAIL protein, indicating initiation of EMT reprogramming. We further induced EMT in non-carcinogenic breast epithelial MCF-10A cells demonstrating that the effects of resistin on EMT were not breast cancer cell specific. In order to assess whether resistin-induced EMT depends on CAP1, we used siRNA approach to silence CAP1 gene in MCF-7 cells. Results demonstrated that when CAP1 was silenced, the induction of SNAIL, ZEB1 and vimentin expression by resistin as well as SNAIL and ZEB1 nuclear translocation, were abolished. Additionally, CAP1 silencing resulted in a suppression of MCF-7 cells migration. We performed quantitative PCR array profiling the expression of 84 genes related to cancer stem cells (CSC), pluripotency and metastasis and selected a set of genes (ALDH1A1, ITGA4, LIN28B, SMO, KLF17, PTPRC, PROM1, SIRT1, and PECAM1) that were modulated by resistin. Further experiments demonstrated that the effect of resistin on the expression of some of these genes (PROM1, PTPRC, KLF17, SIRT1, and PECAM1) was also dependent on CAP1. Our results demonstrate that resistin promotes the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells by inducing EMT and stemness and some of these effects are mediated by CAP1.

AB This study explored the effect of LncRNA Lnc-LIF-AS on cell proliferation, migration and invasion in the human cervical cancer (HCC) cell line SiHa. SiHa cells had the lowest expression of Lnc-LIF-AS in the 4 human cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa, ME-180, C-33A and HeLa) and were transfected and divided into the SiHa/con (transfected with pMIGRI) cell group, SiHa/Lnc-LIF-AS (transfected with pMIGRI-Lnc-LIF-AS) cell group, and SiHa/Lnc-LIF-AS-DN (transfected with pMIGRI-Lnc-LIF-AS-DN, in which the sequences overlapping with LIF mRNA was deleted) cell group. Overexpression of Lnc-LIF-AS could promote the proliferation, colony formation, invasion and migration in SiHa and ME-180 cells. And the low expression of Lnc-LIF-AS suppress the proliferation, colony formation invasion and migration in HeLa cells when the Lnc-LIF-AS expression has been suppressed. In the SiHa/Lnc-LIF-AS cells group, the cell cycle was mainly halted in the S phase and overexpression of Lnc-LIF-AS had no effect on the apoptosis of SiHa cells. Overexpression of Lnc-LIF-AS could promote the secretion of LIF in SiHa cells, and the supernatant from SiHa/Lnc-LIF-AS cells could promote cell proliferation in the SiHa/con cells. The STAT3 inhibitor could inhibit cell proliferation in the SiHa/Lnc-LIF-AS cells. The expression level of Lnc-LIF-AS in cervical cancer tissues was higher than that in normal tissues and the expression level of Lnc-LIF-AS was positively correlated with the level of LIF. In the SiHa/con and SiHa/Lnc-LIF-AS-DN cell groups, there were no significant differences in cell proliferation, cell migration and cell invasion. The overexpression of Lnc-LIF-AS can promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion in cervical cancer cells, and the core function domain of this lncRNA was located in the overlapping a 3'-UTR base sequence of LIF mRNA.

   disease patients: Implications in analyzing risk of disease progression

AB A Summary at a Glance: The diagnosis and progression of nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease (NTN-LD) are important for clinical judgement but cannot easily be predicted. The immunological response of mono- and poly-functional T cells, a representative of host reactivity to NTM, could be a surrogate biomarker for disease and progression prediction.
   Background: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and M. abscessus (MAB) induced lung disease (LD) have become a clinical concern. Predicting clinical disease relevance and progression is important, but suitable biomarkers are lacking. The host immune response of mono- and poly-functional T cells might aid in clinical judgement.
   Methods: We enrolled 140 participants, including 42 MAC-LD, 25 MAB-LD, 31 MAC airway colonization (MAC-Co), 15 MAB-Co patients, and 27 healthy controls. Their blood mono- and poly-functional T cells were measured and analyzed after in-vitro stimulation.
   Results: Patients with MAC-LD generally had lower total IFN-gamma+, total TNF-alpha+ and triple-positive T cells but higher mono-IL-2+ expression than the controls and MAC-Co group. The MAB-LD group had lower total IL-2 and triple positive cells than the controls and colonization group. Multivariate analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI), mono-IL2+ CD4+ and triple positive-CD8+ cells (PMA stimulation) significantly predicted MAC-LD from the controls. By contrast, male gender and triple positive-CD4+ cells predicted MAC-LD from colonization. On the other hand, the triple positive-CD4+ cells (PMA stimulation) alone or together with the mock/MAB ratio of IL-2+/TNF-alpha+ CD4 cells could predict MAB-LD in the MAB-Co group or the controls. Among MAC/MAB-LD patients without anti-mycobacterial treatment, MAC-specific mono-IFN-gamma+ CD4+ cells and PMA-induced triple positive-CD4+ cells were correlated with progression, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.875.
   Conclusions: The patients with MAC/MAB-LD had attenuated poly-functional T cells. The triple-positive CD4+ cells could be useful in diagnosing disease from colonization. MAC-specific mono-IFN-gamma+ CD4+ cells and triple positive-CD4+ might predict radiographic progression, which could be useful in making treatment decisions.

AB Background. The role of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in the development of diabetes and cancer has been established. In this study, we aimed to investigate inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in patients with diabetes (DM) and endometrial carcinoma (EC) separately and in combination.
   Methods: In a case-control study design, a total of 88 participants were enrolled including: 37 patients with EC (19 with DM and 18 without DM), 29 with type2 diabetes and 22 healthy controls. Cancer patients were sampled before treatment. Serum oxidative stress markers including: oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL,) nitric oxide (NO), advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), malondialdehyde (MDA); ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), as an antioxidant marker, and inflammatory markers including: Interleukin 6 (IL6), C reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were measured.
   Results: Ox-LDL, NO, MDA, AOPP and AGE were increased in all patients either with endometrial carcinoma and/or diabetes compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Patients with both EC and DM had higher oxidative markers including: OX-LDL (17.47 +/- 0.84 vs. 12.36 +/- 0.91), NO (82.27 +/- 5.75 vs. 76.34 +/- 5.36), MDA (3.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.75 +/- 0.48) and AGE (73.89 +/- 5.71 vs. 69.02 +/- 3.14) compared to those with EC alone (rho < 0.05). Levels of FRAP was lower in patients with both diabetes and cancer, cancer alone and diabetes alone compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Inflammatory markers, TNF alpha, IL6 and hs-CRP, were also significantly increased in patients with EC with and without DM compared to controls (rho < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between two groups of EC regarding to inflammatory markers (rho > 0.05). Patients with DM had significantly higher levels of inflammatory markers compared to control group (all rho < 0.05). In addition, significant subadditive interaction effect between EC and DM regarding levels of oxLDL, NO, AGE, AOPP and FRAP) was observed (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Increased levels of chronic inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were observed in both endometrial carcinoma and diabetes. Additional effect of diabetes in patients with cancer was mediated more significantly via increase in oxidative stress rather than inflammatory markers.

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of complex and still poorly understood etiology. Loss of upper and lower motoneurons results in death within few years after diagnosis. Recent studies have proposed neuroprotective and disease-slowing effects of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment in ALS mouse models as well as humans. In this study, six ALS patients were monitored up to 3.5 years during continuous high-dose G-CSF administration. Repetitive analyses were performed including blood count parameters, CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) and colony forming cell (CFC) counts, serum cytokine levels and leukocyte telomere length. We demonstrate that continuous G-CSF therapy was well tolerated and safe resulting in only mild adverse events during the observation period. However, no mobilization of CD34(+) HSPC was detected as compared to baseline values. CFC mobilization was equally low and even a decrease of myeloid precursors was observed in some patients. Assessment of telomere length within ALS patients' leukocytes revealed that G-CSF did not significantly shorten telomeres, while those of ALS patients were shorter compared to age-matched healthy controls, irrespective of G-CSF treatment. During G-CSF stimulation, TNF-alpha, CRP, IL-16, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, Tie-2 and VEGF were significantly increased in serum whereas MCP-1 levels decreased. In conclusion, our data show that continuous G-CSF treatment fails to increase circulating CD34(+) HSPC in ALS patients. Cytokine profiles revealed G-CSF-mediated immunomodulatory and proteolytic effects. Interestingly, despite intense G-CSF stimulation, telomere length was not significantly shortened.

AB Thymic vulnerability, a leading cause of defective immunity, was discovered decades ago. To date, several strategies have been investigated to unveil any immunorestorative capacities they might confer. Studies exploiting castration, transplantation, adoptive cell therapies, hormones/growth factors, and cytokines have demonstrated enhanced in vitro and in vivo thymopoiesis, albeit with clinical restrictions. In this review, we will dissect the thymus on a physiological and pathological level and discuss the pros and cons of several strategies esteemed thymotrophic from a pre-clinical perspective. Finally, we will shed light on interleukin (IL)-21, a pharmacologically-promising cytokine with a significant thymotrophic nature, and elaborate on its potential clinical efficacy and safety in immune-deficient subjects.

AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can persist in the cervical epithelium without provoking a strong host immune response, leading to the development of cervical cancer. Cytokines, which mediate innate and adaptive immune activities, are secreted in the cervical mucus; however, there is currently no appropriate method for assessing cytokine levels in mucus specimens. Here, we employed multiplexed bead-based immunoassays to examine cytokine levels in cervical mucus using both weighted-volume and total protein concentration methods to adjust for different specimen volumes in individual patients. Out of 18 cytokines initially examined in the primary cohort patient group (n = 28), 14 were detected in more than 10% of the samples. Of these 14 cytokines, expression levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), RANTES, and eotaxin were significantly increased with the disease severity in the secondary cohort patient group (n = 235). We also examined associations between cytokine levels and clinical parameters, such as cytology and HPV genotype. Of the 14 cytokines, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was down regulated in HPV-positive specimens. Examination of co-expression patterns of cytokines in relation to HPV infection status revealed that several pairs of cytokines were simultaneously upregulated in HPV-positive cases, including INF-gamma and interleukin (IL)-17A, GM-CSF and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), GM-CSF and RANTES, IL-17A and RANTES, and MCP-1 and eotaxin. Interestingly, upregulation of GM-CSF and RANTES might reflect a shift in immuno-regulatory cytokines in HPV-positive specimens, potentially associated with more severe cervical neoplasia.

AB An antibody-cytokine fusion protein, composed of the murine single-chain cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) genetically fused to a human IgG3 specific for the human tumor-associated antigen HER2/neu maintains antigen binding, cytokine bioactivity, and IL-12 heparin-binding activity. This latter property is responsible for the binding of the cytokine to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the cell surface and the extracellular matrix and has been implicated in modulating IL-12 bioactivity. Previous studies indicate that the p40 subunit of human and murine IL-12 is responsible for the heparin-binding activity of this heterodimeric cytokine. In the present study we used bioinformatic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis to develop a version of the antibody-(IL-12) fusion protein without heparin-binding activity. This was accomplished by replacing the basic arginine (R) and lysine (K) residues in the cluster of amino acids 254-260 (RKKEKMK) of the murine IL-12 p40 subunit by the neutral non-polar amino acid alanine (A), generating an AAAEAMA mutant fusion protein. ELISA and flow cytometry demonstrated that the antibody fusion protein lacks heparin-binding activity but retains antigen binding. A T-cell proliferation assay showed IL-12 bioactivity in this construct. However, the IL-12 bioactivity is decreased compared to its non-mutated counterpart, which is consistent with an ancillary role of the heparin-binding site of IL-12 in modulating its activity. Thus, we have defined a cluster of amino acid residues with a crucial role in the heparin-binding activity of murine IL-12 in the context of an antibody-cytokine fusion protein.

AB The current study evaluated the potential of clinical parameters and circulating biomarkers to distinguish sepsis from SIRS in patients admitted with systemic inflammation. Clinical parameters, leukocyte counts and platelets were measured on admission. Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and cytokine concentrations were quantified using laser immunonephelometry, immunoluminescence and a Bio-Plex suspension bead array system respectively. Blood, sputum, urine, peritoneal and cerebrospinal fluid were sent for microscopy and culture. Based on clinical information and the results of microbiological testing, 62 patients were classified retrospectively into 2 groups, those with sepsis (n = 37) or SIRS (n = 25). Mean body temperature was higher and blood pressure lower in the sepsis patients. Circulating concentrations of CRP, PCT, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) were significantly higher in patients with sepsis, with IL-10 identified as the best biomarker in differentiating sepsis from SIRS. The biomarkers that best predicted overall mortality were platelet counts > PCT >= CRP > IL-6 > IL-1Ra. These findings demonstrate that patients with sepsis have significantly increased levels of the immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1Ra and IL-10, compared to those with SIRS, consistent with a more intense counteracting anti-inflammatory response, while a biomarker profile including platelets, PCT, CRP, IL-6 and IL-1Ra may be useful to predict mortality.

AB Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common immune-mediated bleeding disorder in children, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is widely used as the initial therapy of ITP. Effective predictive factors of response to IVIG in ITP are important for guiding the treatment decisions. A retrospective study was performed on 197 Chinese ITP patients, and the data of their serum interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels, age at onset, duration of disease, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count, and gender ratio were collected. Our results showed that ITP patients had higher IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma levels than healthy children. Moreover, lower IL-4 level (< 3.5 pg/ml), higher WBC (> 6.37*10(9)/L), and higher platelet count (> 12 * 109/L) at diagnosis were favorable predictive factors for IVIG response in the newly diagnosed ITP. In addition, ITP patients with lower IL-10 level (< 3.7 pg/ml) and older onset age (> 2.84 years) were more resistant to therapy and developed to chronic ITP more easily. These findings may help guide the treatment decisions making for ITP patients.

AB Objective: Inflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of the study was to investigate serum levels and expression of Interleukin-33 (IL-33) and ST2 receptor in atherosclerotic plaques and to analyze correlation with the type of the carotid plaques in patients with carotid disease.
   Methods: This study included 191 consecutive patients submitted for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Preoperative serum levels of IL-33 and soluble ST2 (sST2) were measured. Atherosclerotic plaques obtained during surgery were initially histologically classified and immunohistochemical analyzes of IL-33, IL-33R, CD68 and alpha-SMA expression was performed. Ultrasound assessment of the level of carotid stenosis in each patient was performed prior to carotid surgery. Demographic and clinical data such as gender, age, smoking status, blood pressure, glycaemia, hemoglobin and creatinine levels, and comorbidities were collected and the comparisons between variables were statistically evaluated.
   Results: Serum levels of IL-33 (35.86 +/- 7.93 pg/ml vs.12.29 +/- 1.8 pg/ml, p < 0.05) and sST2 (183 +/- 8.03 pg/ml vs. 122.31 +/- 15.89 pg/ml, p < 0.05) were significantly higher in the group of CEA patients vs. healthy subjects. We demonstrated abundant tissue expression of IL-33 and ST2 in atherosclerotic carotid artery lesions. The levels of IL-33 and IL-33R expression were significantly higher in vulnerable plaques and significantly correlated with the degree of inflammatory cells infiltration in these plaques (R = 0.579, p = 0.049). Immunohistochemical analysis also revealed that cells responsible for IL-33 expression are not only mononuclear cells confined to inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions, but also smooth muscle cells which gained phenotypic characteristics of foam cells and were loaded with lipid droplets.
   Conclusion: The obtained results confirm the importance of IL-33/ST2 axis in the process of atherosclerosis, and indicate its ambiguous function in immune response, whether as proinflammatory cytokine in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, or as profibrotic, in early lesions.

ID P40 HOMODIMER
AB IL-12 is a key cytokine for the promotion of CD4(+) T cells differentiation to type 1 helper T cells. IL-12 is a heterodimer (IL-12p70) consisting of p40 and p35 subunits, and is mainly secreted from activated antigen presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we found that activated mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) produced a p40 splice variant form mRNA in addition to the conventional p40 mRNA. This p40 variant mRNA was produced by alternative splicing in exon 5, and possessed a premature stop codon. As a result, the p40 variant protein contained 157 amino acids of the N-terminal part of p40 and an additional 10 novel amino acids. When the p40 variant was expressed in HEK-293T cells, it was not secreted from the cells. To investigate the function of the p40 variant, it was co-expressed with p40 and/or p35. The p40 variant did not affect the secretion of IL-12p40 or IL-12p70, or the function of the secreted p70. In contrast, the secretion of IL-12p80, a homodimeric IL-12 with two p40 subunits, was significantly decreased when the p40 variant was expressed.

AB Background and objectives: Upper urinary tract infection is the most common serious bacterial infection in childhood. Patients with upper urinary tract infection have a risk for renal scarring with subsequent complications including hypertension, proteinuria, and progressive renal failure. However, the predictive biomarkers of renal scarring in children with upper urinary tract infection are still unknown. In this study, we evaluated whether soluble ST2 levels can be biomarkers of subsequent renal scarring in patients with upper urinary tract infection.
   Design, setting, participants, and measurements: We retrospectively studied pediatric patients with upper urinary tract infection at a tertiary center. Twenty-eight children had an upper urinary tract infection with (n = 14) and without (n = 14) renal scarring and underwent 99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid imaging. In addition, 13 control subjects were enrolled. The clinical data and serum cytokine levels, including soluble ST2 levels, were compared between those with and without renal scars.
   Results: Serum soluble ST2 levels were significantly higher in the scar group than in the non-scar group, whereas there was no difference in the levels of serum interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, and transforming growth factor-beta between the scar and non-scar groups. The area under the curve for differentiating between the non-scar and scar groups on the basis of measurements of serum soluble ST2 was 0.79, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.9% and 64.3%, respectively.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that serum soluble ST2 levels on admission could be a useful biomarker of subsequent renal scarring in pediatric patients with upper urinary tract infection.

AB ProMyelocytic Leukemia (PML) protein is essential for the formation of nuclear matrix-associated organelles named PML nuclear bodies (NBs) that act as a platform for post-translational modifications and protein degradation. PML NBs harbor transiently and permanently localized proteins and are associated with the regulation of several cellular functions including apoptosis. There are seven PML isoforms, six nuclear (PMLI-VI) and one cytoplasmic (PMLVII), which are encoded by a single gene via alternative RNA splicing. It has been reported that murine PML-null primary cells are resistant to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis and that cytoplasmic PML is an essential activator of TGF-beta signaling. The role and the fate of interferon (IFN)-enhanced PML NBs in response to TGF-beta have not been investigated. Here we show that IFN alpha potentiated TGF-beta-mediated apoptosis in human cells. IFN alpha or ectopic expression of PMLIV, but not of PMLIII, enhanced TGF-beta-induced caspase 8 activation. In response to TGF-beta, both PMLIII and PMLIV were conjugated to SUMO and shifted from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear matrix, however only PMLIV, via its specific C-terminal region, interacted with caspase 8 and recruited it within PML NBs. This process was followed by a caspase-dependent PML degradation and PML NB disruption. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of PML NBs in the enhancement by IFN of TGF-beta-induced apoptosis and caspase 8 activation.

AB Following recent attention focused on IL-32 as an important component involved in the inflammatory cytokine network, we speculated that IL-32's action on IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma secreting T cell subsets may help sustain the immune activation and dysregulation found in patients with HIV-1 achieving viral suppression. To explore this hypothesis, transcript levels of IL-32 and IFN-gamma were evaluated in PBMC from 139 virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected patients and from 63 healthy individuals by Real Time RT-PCR assays. IL-32 and IFN-gamma mRNA levels were also analyzed in CD4 + T cells, CD14 + monocytes and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) of the gut district in a subgroup of HIV-1-infected subjects. IFN-gamma secreting CD4 + (Th1) and CD8 + (Tel) T cell subset frequencies were evaluated in LPL by multiparametric flow cytometry. Gene expression results revealed that IL-32 and IFN-gamma levels in PBMC from HIV-1-positive patients were significantly elevated compared to those from healthy donors, correlated with each other and increased with patient age. Both IL-32 and IFN-gamma genes were also more strongly expressed in CD4 + T cells than in CD14 + monocytes. By contrast, IL-32 levels in LPL were comparable to those measured in PBMC, while IFN-gamma levels were higher in PBMC than those in LPL. Negative correlations were found between IL-32 levels and the frequencies of Th1 and Tc1 subsets in gut mucosa. Collectively, our results provide the first evidence that IL-32 levels remain elevated in treated HIV-1-infected patients and correlate with IFN-gamma, Th1 and Tc1 subsets.

AB Fibrosis affects all vital organs accounting for a staggering 45% of deaths worldwide and no effective therapies are currently available. Unresolved inflammation triggers downstream signaling events that lead to organ fibrosis. In recent years, proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin-17 (IL-17) has been implicated in several chronic inflammatory diseases that often culminate in organ damage followed by impaired wound healing and fibrosis. In this review, we outline the contribution of the IL-17 in mediating fibrotic diseases in various organs. A comprehensive understanding of the inflammatory events, and particularly the details of IL-17 signaling in vivo, could be beneficial in designing new therapeutic or preventive approaches to treat fibrosis. Additionally, understanding organ-specific differences in IL-17 activity could lead to targeted therapies and help spare other organs from unwanted side effects.

AB Establishing the mechanism of protein folding and other physiological processes requires a detailed comprehension of protein-solvent interactions. The fastest protein solvation dynamics have not yet been thoroughly investigated due to challenges associated with controlling few-cycle laser pulses and identifying ideal model systems. Here we use 6 fs laser pulses to quantify the sub-picosecond solvation dynamics of an engineered pigment-protein complex that serves as an ideal probe of solvation dynamics. The data reveal that protein solvation dynamics are described well by a single lifetime of 33 fs, indicating that the mechanism of protein solvation is dominated by the inertial water component.

With a trace of cobalt ions as crosslinker, the graphene oxide sol can be converted into 3D printed ink, overcoming the disadvantage of insufficient viscosity of pure graphene oxide ink. The various graphene architectures were successfully obtained by 3D printing, moreover, graphene/polyaniline composites were obtained by electropolymerization. The specific capacitance of graphene/polyaniline electrode achieved up to 238 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g, which was much higher than that of graphene electrode (35 F/g).

AB A new 2D monolayer material named BeP2C monolayer is predicted. In this prediction we preformed first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to evaluate the stability and investigate the potential electronic and optical properties of the designed monolayer. Through our calculation, it is found that BeP2C Monolayer is an indirect semiconductor with a strain sensitive band gap of 1.40 eV (2.17 eV) calculated by GGA-PBE (HSE06) level of theory. Furthermore the optical properties analysis indicated that the proposed monolayer exhibits visible light sensitivity. The obtained properties suggest this material for using in electromechanical sensing as well as in solar cell applications.

AB A novel dual-templating method was developed to prepare N-doped carbon nanosheets with a similar microstructure but a broad N-doping level (from 0 to 21.6 at%) as support for Ni nanoparticles for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). It is found that the HOR activity on the catalysts exhibits a volcano dependence on the N content of carbon nanosheets, probably due to the change in the hydrogen binding energy on the surface Ni nanoparticles induced through N doping. The catalyst with an N content of 8.7 at% exhibits an optimal HOR activity, which is even comparable to some Pt-group catalysts.

AB We design a series of expanded porphyrins which are incorporated of dithienothiophene (DTT), 2,2'-bithiophene, inverted thiophene ring or selenophene ring and substituted of the pyrrole NH groups by S and Se heteroatoms. The molecule with 2,2'-bithiophene is more stable than the molecule with DTT. The expanded porphyrins with a thiophene or selenophene ring are more stable than the expanded porphyrins with an inverted thiophene or inverted selenophene ring. 6 shows special features due to its increased HOMO-LUMO gap, planar geometry, and strengthened aromaticity. We expect that this work can provide help to design and synthesize stable molecular materials.

AB Infrared Stark spectra for a Nylon 6 film were measured under electric fields from 0.99 to 1.5 MV/cm at 77 K using a sandwich-type cell with a BaF2/Al/Nylon 6/Al structure. The broad asymmetric infrared and Stark spectra observed for amide I (C=O stretch) were fitted with three components: 1637-cm(-1) band (beta-sheet structure), 1645- and 1663-cm(-1) bands (disordered hydrogen-bonded structures). The change in the dipole moment Delta mu between the ground and first excited vibrational states for amide I (beta-sheet structure) was determined to be 0.064 Df(-1), where f is a local field correction factor.

AB SF8TBT and LF8TBT synthesized from analogous precursors have different photovoltaic performances. On account of rationalizing the experimental properties, density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory are employed to investigate the electronic and structural properties of the molecules. The researches involve in geometry properties, absorption spectra, frontier molecular orbitals, hole forming and transporting properties, and exciton dissociation abilities at the molecule/PC71BM interface. The consequences indicate that the better photovoltaic performances of SF8TBT primarily originate from stronger hole forming ability, better hole transport properties, and more favorable exciton dissociation ability. In conclusion, the theoretical results coincide well with the experimental ones.

AB The addition of nanoparticles improves the anti-wear and friction reduction behaviors. The roles of nanoparticles in sliding friction process were investigated at the nanoscale using molecular dynamics simulations. The agglomerated nanoparticles deposited onto the friction surface and formed the protecting film to reduce the friction. Both the rolling friction and sliding friction existed in the friction process. Importantly, the nanoparticles were inclined to fill into the pit which smoothed the friction surface, but a hole in the pit was still observed which could decrease the surface quality.

AB The electronic structures of 9,10-dimethylanthracene (DMA) and its photodimer: di-paraanthracene (DA) have been studied in the gas phase by UV photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The comparison of the spectrum of DA with the spectrum of 9,10-dihydroanthracene (DHA) shows that HOMO ionization is shifted towards lower ionization energy in the former. This is the result of through-space orbital interactions between the two DHA subunits in DA. We have estimated the magnitude of through-space (TS) interaction in DA and found that it amounts to 0.85 eV. This is smaller than TS interaction in [2.2]paracyclophane where the value is 0.95 eV.

AB By using first-principles calculations, the effect of oxygen dopants on the stability and electronic properties of borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) is studied. The doping by oxygen atoms is found as an effective way to increase the stability of BNRs and switched them from a metallic material to semimetal or semiconductor. Our results suggest that the line-edge BNRs exhibit a high stability, while the zigzag-edge BNRs are unstable. In addition, it is predicted that oxygen dopants can stabilize the structure of zigzag-edge BNRs and increase the stability of the line-edge BNRs.

Powder XRD depicts the structural property of the materials. Optical absorption spectra were evaluated by diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and observed the maximum absorption around 450 nm. FTIR spectra were used to analyze the organic moieties present in the compound. Morphological aspects and chemical composition were estimated by FESEM images and ED spectra. PL spectra were taken to observe the emission of the materials. Resistivity and conductivity measurements confirm the materials were semiconductors.

AB Hexagonal YBO3 photocatalysts were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method. The samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, UV-vis, photocatalytic performance, photocurrent and electrochemical impedance analysis. The results show that the pH value has a large effect on the formation of the microspheres. The excellent photocatalytic performance for RhB degradation depends on the exposed {1 0 (1) over bar0} facets in which the fitting concentration of oxygen vacancy can prevent the recombination of the photogenerated carriers. Meantime, the {1 0 (1) over bar0} faceted YBO3 microspheres enhance the absorption of irradiation light and present highest specific surface area which can also accelerate photocatalytic activity.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra show the prepared samples are g-C3N4 and Co doped g-C3N4. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) shows heavily Co doped g-C3N4 (0.15 wt%) exhibits better absorption characteristic in the wavelength range 450-800 nm. Using first principles based on density functional theory, the undoped and Co doped C3N4 were built and studied. Compared with others, the heavily Co doped g-C3N4 (C3Co0.375N3.625) exhibits excellent optical properties such as absorption and photoconductivity.

TI Effects of Ba doping on the phase transition of Sr3Sn2O7

AB The ceramics of Sr3-xBaxSn2O7 (0 <= x <= 0.6) were synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The lattice constants of Sr3-xBaxSn2O7 increase with increasing of Ba doping. With increasing of the Ba2+ concentration from x = 0 to x = 0.2, the phase transition temperature reduces by 73 K. The vibration modes related to the phase transitions are strongly related to the tilting and rotation of SnO6 octahedra. The doping of Ba significantly aggravates the anharmonic effect and increases the Raman activity of the vibration mode A(2)((5)), and reduces the phonon lifetime and the Raman activity of the vibration mode A(1)((17)).

AB Gold nanoparticles in the cores coated by non-porous silica shells (Au@nSiO(2)) and by porous silica shells (Au@pSiO(2)) were synthesized and used to catalyze the reduction and oxidation reactions to understand the influence of the structure of silica shells on their catalytic activity. Au@pSiO(2) nanoparticles well catalyze the reduction and oxidation reactions while Au@pSiO(2) nanoparticles are inactive for those reactions. The characterizations combining with catalytic reactions reveal that the porosity of silica shells is responsible for catalytic activity.

AB The optoelectronic and thermoelectric properties of RbXO2 (X = Al, Ga, In) oxides have been investigated by using the density functional theory (DFT). The stability of RbXO2 has been confirmed from the negative value of enthalpy of formation, Goldschmidt's tolerance factor (0.91, 0.95 and 1.02) and Born mechanical stability criteria. The bandgap of the studied RbXO2 lies in the range from 3.3 eV to 1.25 eV, which shifts the optical region from near ultraviolet to near infrared region of spectrum. The comparative analysis of optical and thermoelectric properties shows RbXO2 are more suitable for optoelectronic applications than thermoelectric applications.

AB Insight into the binding mechanisms of inhibitors of MDM2 are of significance for the development of drugs targeting the p53-MDM2 protein complex. In this work, an MD simulation, MM-GBSA, and SIE methods are combined to study the interaction details of MDM2 with three small nutlins. Structural analyses show that inhibitor binding can weaken the structural flexibility of MDM2. Energy analyses show that the hot spots of the p53-MDM2 interaction can be well-mimicked by two chlorophenyl groups and an ethoxybenzene group. Moreover, an additional strong hot spot (V89) was detected.

AB In order to develop an efficient framework for global screening in the material exploration, we performed a clustering analysis of machine learning on the multi-dimensional thermophysical properties of the liquid substances. Data mining using a self-organizing map (SOM) based on the unsupervised learning was employed to project high-dimensional thermophysical data onto a low-dimensional space. Here we adopted 98 liquid substances with eight thermo-physical properties for the SOM training in order to group the liquid substances. The present SOM-clustering approach properly categorized liquid substances according to the chemical species characterized by the functional groups.

AB The interactions between single-chain and Gemini surfactants with hemoglobin (Hb) were extensively investigated by UV-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and Zeta potential measurements. The results demonstrated that surfactants can destroy the hydrophobic cavity of Hb, and make the alpha-helical become loose and convert it into the beta-sheet structure. The interactions between surfactants and Hb are mainly caused by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The hydrophobic chain length and linking group length of surfactants have significant influence on tuning the conformations of Hb. The study provides a molecular basis for the applications of protein-surfactant complexes in biological, pharmaceutical, industrial and cosmetic systems.

AB First-principle calculations have been executed to examine the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional GaN/BAs heterostructures with three possible stacking orders. It has been disclosed that these heterostructures are semiconductors and dynamically stable. Also, it should be accentuated that AB and BB stackings have indirect band gaps of about 1.71 and 1.685 eV, respectively. Most importantly, AA stacking exhibit a direct band gap of 0.676 eV pointing out that it is helpful to photocatalysis. Owing to special optical and electronic properties of GaN/BAs vdW heterostructures, it is ratiocinated that these heterostructures can be congenial for the solar cell applications.

AB The ultrafast photophysical properties of dimethyl amino styryl pyridine acetonitrile (DASPA) were studied by the femtosecond transient absorption spectra (TA). The results show no evidence of state-to-state relaxation. The excited energy is released by the interaction between DASPA and solvent molecules. The solvation relaxation in protic solutions is faster than that in aprotic solutions, which results in a rapid decay of fluorescence. An energy diagram is finally proposed to interpret the relaxation mechanism.

AB A new 2D monolayer namely penta-BeP2 carried out by the density functional theory is reported. Our simulations indicate that the 2D penta-BeP2 shows good structural, dynamical and thermal stabilities as demonstrated by cohesive energy calculation, phonon dispersion simulation, and molecular dynamic analysis respectively. It is discovered that the penta-BeP2 is a 2D semiconductor with a strain tunable indirect band gap of about 0.8 eV computed by HSE06 level of theory. Analyzing the optical behaviors of this monolayer shows the monolayer has visible light sensitivity suggests its promising application in optical devices for using in low energy range of electromagnetic spectrum.

AB Based on the constructed CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ potential energy surface, the detailed kinetics of the desflurane (CF3CHFOCHF2) + Cl/OH reactions was investigated using canonical transition state theory (TST) with corrections of the hindered internal rotation and tunneling treatments. The suggested rate constants, namely k(Cl) (T)= 8.76 x 10(-21) x T-3.2 x exp(-1961 K/T) and k(OH) (T)= 1.19 x 10(-23) x T-3.7 x exp (-481 K/T) (cm(3).molecule(-1).s(-1)) in the temperature range of 200-2000 K, are in good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the subsequent unimolecular reactions of the desflurane radicals were also investigated under the atmospheric conditions.

AB Direct measurements of H-1, H-2 and C-13 NMR shielding are performed for 13 deuterated liquid solvents using an isolated helium-3 atom as the primary reference standard of shielding. It has been possible exploring the absolute resonance frequencies and nuclear magnetic moments of the investigated nuclei. The measured shielding values are verified using appropriate chemical shifts with the accurate values of H-1 and C-13 shielding in liquid TMS. As shown, all the new H-2 shielding parameters of the investigated solvents can be applied as the secondary reference standards of shielding for gases and liquids in usual NMR laboratory practice.

AB The degree of advance in the formation of the emerging C-C bond at the transition state for the cycloaddition step of the mechanism of the Wittig reaction dictates the stereochemistry of the final alkenes. Our discovery appears to be of general validity as we tested multiple reactions for stabilized, non-stabilized, and semi-stabilized ylides, holding in every case regardless of the nature of the ylide, the geometry of the associated transition states and the nature of the interactions between substituents.

AB We report a controllable method to synthesize two different morphologies of two dimensional (2D) 1T'-MoTe2 film: rectangular MoTe2 and irregular MoTe2, respectively. The synthesis was carried out via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with sodium chloride (NaCl) as promoters. Our results show that topography of rectangular MoTe2 nanosheets have more uniform thickness while irregular nanosheets have poorer crystallization quality with more grain boundaries. Moreover, the surface friction decreases with the increasing thickness of 2D MoTe2, owing to the gradually decreased surface corrugation of nanosheets as the thickness increase. Our work provides a feasible method to synthesize the challenging transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).

AB Zn-air fuel cells (ZAFC) with electrolyte flow are the widely acknowledged. In this study, the theoretical aspects of OH- groups reaction with the Zn cluster were proposed using ab initio calculations. The optimal flowrate was then determined as 100 ml/min. The performance was determined as production of open circuit voltage, power and current density values which were with 1.41 V, 427.7 mW/cm(2) and 518.6 mA/cm(2) respectively. The ZAFC with electrolyte flow exhibited better reduction in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Nyquist plots were exploited to justify the results. Thus, upgrading processes of the ZAFC will prominently provide immense opportunities for their applications.

AB A dual-layered shells/core microcrystal (graphene-oxide (GO)-titanium-dioxide (TiO2)/sodium-chloride (NaCl), GTNC) is synthesized by evaporation crystallization. After thermal reduction, an alternating hydrophilic (TiO2 nanoparticles)/hydrophobic (rGO plates) nanostructure is formed, sharing similarities to the water-vapor-harvesting system of desert beetles. rGTNC microcrystals could deliquesce at lower relative humidity (59 +/- 3%, RH) than that of NaCl (similar to 75% RH), and form larger water droplets similar to 4-8 times its original areal size. The enhanced performance is attributed to surface energy gradients and water adsorbing capability. The results confirm that rGTNC microcrystals can be used as efficient cloud seeding materials.

SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS

ID DENSITY FUNCTIONALS
AB Encapsulation complexes of hexyl- and cyclohexyl-halides in water soluble cavitands with urea rims have been investigated by DFT calculations. In agreement with experiment, the most stable conformations of the different encapsulated halides have the halide at the rim of the cavity, or "up". The possibility of halogen bonding of Br to the resorcinarenes of the cavitand is suggested by the near degeneracy of "up" and "down" conformations found in encapsulated bromides. In the calculations, in addition to the implicit inclusion of the solvent, explicit addition of water molecules at the rim of the tetra-urea cavitand is found to be necessary.

AB The high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) materials are extremely vigorous for the information storage. Based on first principle calculations, we found the MAE of metallophthalocyanine (MPc) is greatly changed by adopting halogen atoms due to the strong interaction between metal and halogen atom. The influence of the interaction is also related to the bond length between the halogen and metal. Finally, the variation of the bond length d(W-Cl) can be realized by applying external electric. This study provided guidance for modulating the MAE for 2D magnetic films for the practical applications.

AB A teetotum form is found as the global equilibrium structure of V2B7+/0/- clusters. Formation of a bimetallic configuration and aromaticity are found to be dominant factors stabilizing the doped V2B7+/0/- teetotum structures. Magnetic ring current maps indicate the V2B7+ cation as doubly aromatic. Exploration on the interactions of one and two CO2 molecules with the pure B-7(-) and doped VB7 and V2B7+/0/- clusters shows that these boron-based clusters can capture CO2 and transform it through a dissociative adsorption mechanism. The pure B-7(-) anion cluster performs even better than the doped clusters in CO2 capture ability.

AB The adapted Numerov approach was extended to periodic problems and applied to the torsional tunneling splitting of six increasingly complex target systems carrying a hydroxy-group. The deviations from experiment remained on the order of 1 cm(-1), except for phenol in which the exceptionally small ground-state tunneling-splitting of 0.0017 cm(-1) was found in very good agreement with the experimental value of 0.0019 cm(-1). Overall, the accuracy of the periodic Numerov approach for the treatment of torsional tunneling is on the same order as alternative approaches, but at a substantially reduced computational demand due to the restriction of the problem to the respective degree of freedom.

AB The effects of different electrolyte anions on the interfacial tension (IFT) of surfactant solution of Para-dimethyl alkylbenzene sulfonate (PDABS) were discussed in detail. The results showed that the electrolyte can reduce the IFT by changing the ionic strength of the aqueous solution, compressing the electric double layer of hydrophilic group of the surfactant and increasing the adsorption concentration of the active substance at the interface. For the different electrolyte anions, the effect of this factor showed the same trend of changing IFT. With the increase of electrolyte anions concentration, IFT first decreased rapidly and then decreased slowly, meanwhile, the surfactant was continuously distributed into the oil phase. When the oil-water partition coefficient was 1, the IFT had a minimum value, IFTmin. Because the anions of electrolytes were different, the polarity and structure of water molecules near the interface were changed, resulting in the different decrease of IFT. The hydrolysis of CO32- produced OH-, which made the water molecules polarized highly, and the CO32- with relatively large ionic radius had a weak binding force on water molecules, resulting in the largest difference between the two sides of the interface and the decrease of IFT was the slowest. NaCl had no ability to produce OH- by hydrolysis, and its ionic radius was also small, so the IFT decreased the most rapidly. For the same reason, the decrease degree of IFT in NaOH and NaHCO3 aqueous was between Na2CO3 and NaCl. With the increase of the lipophilic chain length of PDABS, the solubility of PDABS in water was greatly affected by the electrolyte concentration, and the IFTmin moved to the low electrolyte concentration. The movement of p-S18-4 was most obvious, which had reached IFTmin at the concentration of 180.0 mol.L-1, and there was a second low value of IFT under the interaction of the change of single-layer adsorption micro-structures and spontaneous emulsification.

AB The Born Oppenheimer (BO) and Renner Teller (RT) time dependent quantum dynamics are investigated for the reaction ND(a(1)Delta) + D'(S-2), considering the NH2 electronic states (X) over tilde B-2(1) and (A) over tilde (2)A(1). The introduction of RT effects opens the possibility of studying not only the adiabatic reactions (depletion-A N(D-2) + D-2(a(1)Delta) and Exchange ND' + (a(1)Delta) + D) but also non-adiabatic ones (quenching + exchange ND'(X-3 Sigma(-)) + D, depletion-X N(S-4) + D-2(a(1)Delta)). The initial state resolved reaction probabilities, cross sections, and rate constants are obtained considering the Coriolis Coupling (CC) interactions for all the reactions above. To point out the role of RT and CC effect, we compared our results with experimental and semi-classical data.

AB A novel and facile strategy was developed to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon/NiMoO4 (NDC/NiMoO4) nanospheres using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-polyvinyl pyrrolidone-cyclohexane-water-ethanol microemulsion aggregation as a soft template. The prepared NDC/NiMoO4 exhibited a marvelous specific capacitance of 1045 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). After 10,000 cycles the specific capacity is 60% of the initial performance. The energy density reached 107.3 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 799.9 W kg(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique morphology of NDC/NiMoO4 and the abundant doped N and C elements. This study enables their application in high-performance supercapacitors.

AB Riparian zones have disproportional ecological importance relative to their size. For decades, the functionality of riparian zones has been altered, with detrimental consequences on biodiversity. Recently, riparian zone restoration has become a major issue. When channel mobility cannot be restored and when erosion control is of primary concern, soil bioengineering techniques are often viewed as a compromise solution. We studied 37 riverbanks, from civil engineering to soil bioengineering, plus natural willow stands, in the foothills of the Alps and Jura Mountains. Using a principal component analysis, we first studied whether terrestrial and aquatic habitat variables varied among riverbank stabilization structures and bank stabilization age and built a synthetic index of riparian habitat quality reflecting the multivariate similarity of riverbank sites. Then, using a modelling approach, we tested whether multi-taxonomic diversity responded to changes in habitat quality and to broadscale environmental variables (i.e., climate, hydrology and land cover). Soil bioengineering techniques, especially willow fascines and to lower extend vegetated crib wall, enhanced riparian habitat quality by allowing for a greater richness and density of pioneer tree species but also for a larger cover of high quality aquatic micro-habitats. This increase in riparian habitat quality induced an increase in both terrestrial and aquatic species diversity, highlighting the added-value of soil bioengineering techniques to restore riparian biodiversity. This may confirm that stabilization structures made of willow fascines are better suited than stabilization structures made of artificial substrata to support riparian species. Also, beyond the positive effect of soil bioengineering techniques for riparian biodiversity, we found that climatic, hydrological and land cover variables strongly influenced diversity patterns. Thus, multi-taxonomic diversity decreased along larger rivers and in landscapes dominated by urban areas. This may indicate that the full added value of soil bioengineering techniques for biodiversity will only become apparent if more attention is paid to mitigating the negative impact of human activities in the vicinity of riparian zones and if larger scale environmental parameters are taken into account as early as possible in restoration project. Therefore, we strongly recommend that riverbank restoration projects, based on the active introduction of native pioneer tree species, should be planned at the catchment scale.

AB The present study aims to integrate multinomial logistic regression with an input variable selection method, genetic algorithm, GA, to select the most important explanatory variables for evaluating the occurrence patterns of the bleak (Alburnoides eichwaldii) in river. Seven different sampling sites (from the source to the mouth of the Shafaroud River, north of Iran) were considered to analyse the probability of occurrence of the fish during one year sampling campaign. The abundance of bleak (based on 42 fish presence and 42 fish absence data, as outputs of model) together with a set of physical-chemical water characteristics and river morphology (84 instances as inputs of model) were monthly and repeatedly recorded at each sampling site. Two-third of instances (56) was used for training and the remaining of instances (28) as test set. The results of paired Student's t-test showed that the predictive performances of model (% correctly classified instance and Kappa statistics) were improved after variable selection method. GA selected 9 of 18 input variables including dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature, river depth, electric conductivity, total hardness, nitrite, orthophosphate and sulphate. The curves of binary logistic regression confirmed that increasing three of the selected variables (dissolved oxygen, water temperature and pH) might increase the probability of bleak presence while increasing concentration of other selected variables might decrease the probability of fish occurrence in the river basin (p < 0.05 for all). Information on the occurrence patterns of indicator fish species in relation to physico-chemical water quality and habitat variables is important to develop conservation and management programs for the study river, where water resources are facing with high risk of pollution due to increasing of agricultural and industrial development activities.

AB The assessment of hydrological impacts due to a changing climate has been an important tool for supporting future planning and management actions to mitigate these impacts. This study aimed to assess the climate change impacts on streamflow and sediment loads in the Upper Paranaiba river basin (UPRB), Southeastern Brazil. The SWAT model was applied to estimate the streamflow and sediment loads under observed conditions and to quantify possible climate change impacts from a multi-model ensemble and four Regional Climate Models (RCM) under two climate change scenarios. The results showed that simulations from the RCMs indicated reductions in streamflow varying from 27.6 to 75%. In addition, the simulated sediment loads were in agreement with the temporal pattern of streamflow. Besides all the uncertainties involved in climate change impacts simulations, the UPRB would suffer serious problems regarding to the water availability in extreme climatic conditions. As this basin is entirely inserted on the Brazilian Cerrado biome, the results can be useful in the context of eco-hydrological services, such as fresh water availability and identification of the land-use/soil combinations that are more vulnerable to water erosion.

AB The H-02 wetland was constructed on the Savannah River Site (SC, USA) in 2007 to remove Cu and Zn from process and storm runoff water. Water samples were routinely collected from 2008 to 2017 in the primary discharge pipes, influent, effluent, and receiving stream. Water quality parameters were measured in situ, total and dissolved metal (Cu and Zn) concentrations were determined, and metal speciation was calculated with the Biotic Ligand Model. Generally, the H-02 wetland system functioned well during the reporting period. Alkaline waters in the pipe became neutral after running through the wetland. Total metal concentrations in the effluent were lower than the regulatory discharge limit with a removal efficiency of 63.8% (95% CI: 60.8-66.8%) for Cu and 70.5% (95% CI: 67.0-73.9%) for Zn. Reduced metal toxicity was inferred from the observed lower concentrations of free Cu2+ and Zn2+ in the effluent than that in the influent and pipe. As suggested by the higher percentage of Cu-organic matter complexes than Zn-organic matter complexes, Cu had a higher affinity for natural organic ligands than Zn. A three-stage performance pattern of a metal-removing constructed wetland was hypothesized, which includes the plateau stage, the trough stage, and the recovery stage. Further studies were needed to test this hypothesis, monitor the treatment efficiency, improve operation strategies, and ensure the long-term sustainability of H-02 wetland system.

AB Drainage channels are a widespread component of agricultural and urbanized lowland landscapes. Management of instream and riparian vegetation along drainage channels must be planned by reconciling the need to ensure channel hydraulic efficiency with the need to preserve the riparian habitat. The present paper reports the experimental results of a study conducted on a drainage channel colonized by Phragmites australis in undisturbed natural conditions. The impacts of common reed on flow resistance, flow velocity distribution and turbulence parameters were examined with different discharges under three different scenarios of channel vegetation, which were obtained by means of machineries traditionally used in land reclamation areas. Removing either totally or partially the channel vegetation had great effects on streamwise velocity distribution and turbulence patterns, with small differences in global flow resistance. The experimental results suggest that clearing the channel vegetation just in the center of the cross section can improve the channel conveyance to values close to those obtained with the total removal of the vegetation, while maintaining relatively high levels of turbulent intensities.

AB Accurate assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks and analyzing the main influencing factors after revegetation for restoration of sandy soils in alpine regions are important for formulating sustainable management measures and understanding the role of revegetation in mitigating climate change. This study compared SOC and TN stocks and their vertical distributions among 6-, 11-, 17- and 31-year-old Caragana intermedia plantations and shifting sand dunes. The results showed that SOC and TN stocks significantly increased as plantation age increased, with the 31-year-old stands having the highest SOC stocks (26.73 Mg ha(-1)) and TN stocks (2.64 Mg ha(-1)), which were 97.4% and 149.56% higher, respectively, than those of the shifting sand dunes. Compared to the total soil depth, SOC and TN stocks at all stand ages were higher in surface soil (0-20 cm). SOC stocks in the surface soil of the 6-, 11-, 17- and 31-year-old stands were 38.03%, 71.32%, 103.67% and 253.30% higher, respectively, than those in the surface soil of the shifting sand dunes, and TN stocks in the surface soil were 17.03%, 117.96%, 148.93% and 232.06% higher, respectively, than those in the surface soil of the shifting sand dunes. The percentage of the SOC and TN stock in the 0-20 cm soil depth increased significantly as plantation age increased, with the 31-year-old plantation reaching 43.66% and 33.39%, respectively. Redundancy analysis and correlation analysis showed that at 0-20 cm soil depth, aboveground biomass was the main influencing factor for SOC and TN stocks. At 20-80 cm soil depth, fine root biomass and medium root biomass were the main influencing factors for SOC stocks, and medium root biomass was the main influencing factor for TN stocks.

AB Peatlands on which there is vacuum peat harvesting must be drained to allow peat extraction. Peat erosion due to mechanical filling, vacuum harvest and rain can generate large suspended sediment concentrations that must be reduced before reaching the receiving waters. In this study, six sedimentation basins were monitored over one or two ice-free seasons, resulting in seven basin-years time series, to estimate their trapping efficiency. Using these data, two modelling approaches were first applied to predict the seasonal trapping efficiency of the basins, namely the Brown equation and a multilinear regression model (MLR). Secondly, an additional approach based on the hydrodynamic model MOHID was used to compute the trapping efficiency of one of the basins for a single rain event. The Brown equation, used worldwide in agricultural sedimentation ponds, proved to be less efficient in predicting the trapping efficiency of the basins (r = 0.67, p = 0.1, leave-one-out RMSE = 47.2%) than a MLR model using the volume of the basin, the surface of the harvested catchment and the Von Post decomposition degree of the peat as predictors (r = 0.87, p = 0.01, leave-one-out RMSE = 31.6%). The deterministic MOHID model was capable of reproducing high flow suspended sediment concentration at the basin outlet, based on measured settling velocity distribution of the peat through ViCAs protocol, but requires a good description of the settling velocity distribution across multiple hydrological conditions to simulate the suspended sediment concentrations over a full season in order to compute trapping efficiency. The results presented here provide new insights on eroded peat modelling and could lead to better design formulas for basin conception.

AB Subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS) is an eco-friendly technology treating domestic sewage. On the other hand, SWIS has been found to be a source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. Unfortunately, the contribution of different depth layers to N2O emission is still unclear. Therefore, this study sampled N2O samples in different layers using a stratified gas sampler. Three parallel SWISs were operated under low, medium and high hydraulic loads, respectively. The results showed that N2O emission and conversion rate of SWIS were 12.5-27.5 g/m(2).y and 0.11-0.35%, respectively. Within the tested loads of 5, 10 and 15 cm/d, the amount of N2O produced decreased as the load increased. SWIS amended with 10% activated sludge degraded nitrogen effectively with effluent quality meeting the first class A standard of the "Discharge Standard of Pollutants for Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant" (GB/T18918-2002). Under varying influent load strengths, anaerobic zone was the main source for N2O emission. When the hydraulic load increased from 5 cm/d to 15 cm/d, the contributions of anaerobic zone increased from 43.56% to 65.09% for wetting period and from 38.01% to 78.8% for drying period, respectively.

AB Portable in situ ultraviolet-visual spectrometers, through high frequency water quality measurements, provide new insight into biogeochemical processes occurring within dynamic ecosystems. Nitrogen and carbon cycling were observed in two distinct wetland mesocosm environments during a two-year mesocosm study. Simulated drainage water was loaded into the mesocosms across seasons with target nitrate-N levels between 2.5 and 10 mg L-1. Nitrate-N and dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the water column were measured hourly with the spectrometer and calibrated with water quality grab samples. Prominent and unique diel cycles were observed in both nitrate-N and dissolved organic carbon readings from the spectrometer, which reveal biogeochemical processes in these systems are more complicated than typically considered in empirical models.

AB The Mekong River is one of the most biodiverse rivers on Earth. Many communities located near the river rely on fisheries for sustenance and economics. Along the Mekong River mainstem there are plans for 11 new hydropower projects, with potentially several hundred smaller projects along tributaries. To understand the hydraulic conditions at existing dams in the region, Sensor Fish were deployed at Nam Ngum Dam in Laos. The data collected by Sensor Fish can be used to predict fish injury/mortality if there is a dose-response relationship for the species of interest. The Sensor Fish were released through two units-Unit 1, an older 17.5-MW Francis turbine, and Unit 4, a newer 40-MW Francis turbine. Comparisons were made between the Sensor Fish measurements at Nam Ngum to those from four hydroelectric dams in the U.S. Between the newer and older turbine units tested at Nam Ngum, the newer Unit 4 had a higher median nadir pressure of 126 kPaA compared to 99 kPaA. With respect to both pressure and acceleration, the older Unit 1 had more severe hydraulic conditions. By understanding the physical conditions within existing hydropower projects, and the potential ecological impact those conditions could have on the local fauna, better informed decisions can be made regarding project operations. The results from this study can also be used to guide the engineering design of new hydropower turbines that will improve ecological conditions.

AB The application of controlled fire on post-mine rehabilitation is currently underutilised as an ecological tool throughout fire prone landscapes such as eastern Australia. Despite widely accepted benefits of fuel management and ecological outcomes, mined land managers are generally reluctant to incorporate fire regimes on rehabilitated lands. We applied an experimental fire to 117 ha of 19- to 21-year-old coal mine rehabilitation in subtropical, semi-arid Central Queensland, Australia, and assessed the vegetation changes in five successive assessments for the two years following the burn. Vegetation metrics all showed trajectories towards pre-fire levels, or recovered to surpass pre-fire levels. Within two years of the burn, native species richness was significantly higher than pre-fire levels for both grassland and open woodland areas and vegetation cover had returned to pre-fire levels. Woody plant density ( < 2 m) increased from an average of 425-3,255 stems ha(-1) in open woodland areas reaching values higher than those recorded at unburnt historical transects (n = 145); while stems greater than 2 m in height declined from 585 to 220 ha(-1) due to the death of mature Acacia spp. The vegetative response following two wet seasons demonstrates short-term recovery following a range of fire impacts and demonstrates the potential to enhance the quality of the rehabilitation and increase the possibility of early relinquishment by reducing ecological, financial and reputational risks.

AB Large-scale afforestation is a key measure to mitigate global warming, however, implementation may result in land-use competition with agriculture. To avoid such competition, carbon mitigation methods using arid and semi-arid areas have been proposed, but to our knowledge there is no report of rates of sequestration based on long-term observations from actual experimentation. In this study (1999-2015), in an arid area near Leonora, Western Australia (annual rainfall: 220 mm year(-1); pan evaporation: 3400 mm year (-1)), carbon sequestration was assessed in above and below ground biomass in Eucalyptus camaldulensis under ambient conditions and with active site amelioration (combination of water harvesting with large mounds and hardpan blasting). The carbon sequestration rate was estimated at 7.92 Mg-CO2-e ha(-1) year(-1) for a total carbon sink of 230 Mg-CO2-e ha(-1). Carbon mitigation may thus be a viable option in arid regions, not only in Western Australia but globally, and can be enhanced with active site engineering.

AB With increasing evidences of climate change affecting coastal waters, there is a strong need to understand future climate conditions and assess the potential responses of delicate coastal ecosystems. Results of climate change studies based on only one GCM-RCM combination should be interpreted with caution as results are highly dependent on the assumptions of the selected combination. In this study we examined the uncertainty in the hydrological and ecological parameters of the Zero river basin (ZRB) - Palude di Cona (PDC) coastal aquatic ecosystem generated by the adoption of an ensemble of climate projections from ten different combinations of General Circulation Model (GCM) - Regional Climate Model (RCM) under two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) implemented in the hydrological model (SWAT) and the ecological model (AQUATOX). The baseline period of 1983-2012 was used to identify climate change variations in two future periods: mid-century (2041-2070) and late-century (2071-2100) periods. SWAT outputs from the ensemble indicate a summer reduction in inorganic nitrogen loadings of 1-22% and a winter increase of 1-19%. Inorganic phosphorus loadings indicate a yearly increase of 32-61%. AQUATOX outputs from the ensemble show major changes in the summer period, with an increase in Chl-a concentration of 9-56%, a decrease in diatoms of 74-98% and an increase in cyanobacteria of 421-3590%. Obtained results confirm that the use of multiple GCM-RCM projections can provide a more robust assessment of climate change impacts on the hydrology and ecology of coastal waters, but at the same time highlight the large uncertainty of climate change-related impact studies, which can affect the decision-making processes regarding the management and preservation of sensitive aquatic ecosystems such as those in coastal areas.

AB Treatment peatlands are water purification systems located on existing mires. They are commonly used to treat different types of waters, ranging from municipal wastewaters to mine effluent. This study evaluated the capacity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal infrared (TIR) imaging, color infrared imaging, and stable water isotopes as a combined method for monitoring the functioning of a treatment peatland purifying mine process effluent water under boreal conditions in northern Finland. The results showed that TIR was an efficient tool for pinpointing cold groundwater seepage points in the peatland area that were not otherwise visible. Color infrared imaging was used to define Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an indicator of plant health in the treatment area. A NDVI map of the area, measured on a day representing the main growing season (summer, +12 degrees C day temperature), revealed areas with stressed coniferous trees. This was probably due to excess water in these areas, resulting from successful spread of the process effluent water to the treatment peatland. Stable water isotopes were able to spatially differentiate the treated process effluent water, surface waters, and groundwater in different parts of the treatment peatland. This first attempt at combining these methods in monitoring of treatment peatlands was promising, as the results obtained with different methods complemented each other. While they produce only a snapshot of prevailing conditions, all three methods, singly and in combination, could be valuable tools in treatment peatland management.

AB Flow patterns (FPs) are different due to different fishway structures and different boundary conditions in a river. FPs can greatly affect fish passage efficiency along the entire fishway. In this study, experimental hydraulic modelling is combined with the study of fish behavior in a physical model of a vertical slot fishway (VSF) with different slot positions and varying pool lateral baffle length (P) to width (B) ratios. A three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is used to help understand the detailed hydraulic structures. Three distinct FPs are studied. When P/B < 0.2 and a short baffle was used, the principal flow was along the side wall with almost no curve to the next slot, and this was termed FP1. When 0.2 < P/B < 0.34 and a medium size baffle was used, the principal flow was in the center position. Hence, the principal flow leaving the slot entered the pools as a curved jet that dispersed into the pool center before converging again towards the next slot, and this was termed FP2. When P/B > 0.4 and a long baffle was used, the jet had a curved form along the opposite side wall, and this was termed FP3. Comparison experiments are conducted on the three FPs, and 82 to 90 trials are conducted to compare juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) reactions to each FP. An analysis of the fish behavior in the model clearly demonstrated that the fish tended to need less time to pass in FP2 than in the other two FPs. FP2, with the principal flow in the center position, tended to be more suitable for fish migration. In addition, using an analysis of the less efficient FPs, it was found that the velocity gradient may act as an important migration behavior motivator, and that a recirculation zone too close to the downstream slot could increase the risk of downstream flush. It is suggested that further studies should investigate the behaviors of different fish species in the three typical FPs.

AB With an aim to determine whether Spartina alterniflora actively changes the habitat environment, thus facilitating its successful competition over native species, a field experiment was carried out at the Jiuduansha Wetland National Nature Reserve. Sulfur concentrations in the soil sediments were compared among wetlands dominated by the exotic Spartina alterniflora, the co-occurring native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. The results show that the soil sulfur concentrations in the Spartina alterniflora community showed significant spatiotemporal variability with the years since invasion. The S. alterniflora community contained the highest concentrations of sulfur in the soil sediment. Moreover, the sulfur concentrations were higher in the initial invasion area than at the edges of the invading area. The was little difference in soil sulfur concentrations between communities containing native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. There were significant correlations between soil sulfur concentrations and carbon and nitrogen concentrations; the soil nitrogen concentrations were negatively correlated with the sulfur concentrations, and the carbon concentrations were positively correlated with the sulfur concentrations. In different seasons, the concentration of sulfur is relatively higher in spring than which in other seasons. Furthermore, the sulfur concentrations at different soil depths also exhibited significant changes with depths. In addition, the soil sulfur concentrations associated with S. alterniflora also showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with depth, the soil sulfur concentrations in S. alterniflora soils were obviously higher than those in the S. mariqueter community and unvegetated mudflat, the maximum concentrations in S. alterniflora soils occurred at the depth of 40-60 cm. The findings of this study indicate that S. alterniflora increases wetland sulfur storage, which may explain the mechanism of expansion of S. alterniflora in the Jiuduansha Wetland.

AB River pollution has become a growing concern in developing countries. It can affect food supplies, drinking water, and environment hence impacting animal and human health. The present study was designed to explore the potential of floating wetlands (FWs) in partnership with pollutant-degrading bacteria for the clean-up of heavily contaminated water of river Ravi at microcosm scale. River Ravi receives excessive discharges of untreated sewage and industrial wastewater from the Lahore city. To this end, FWs are sustainable alternatives to treat wastewater because of their high efficiency and simplicity in the design and structure. Thus, remediation potential of FWs planted with two macrophytes namely Phragmites australis and Brachia mutica was evaluated in the presence of a consortium five different rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria. We found a significant reduction of organic and inorganic pollutants by the application of FWs, whose potential was further boosted by bacterial inoculation. The performance of P. australis was better than B. mutica. Briefly, plant-bacterial synergism for P. australis reduced COD, BOD5, and TOC up to 85.9%, 83.3%, and 86.6% in 96 h, respectively. Total nitrogen was reduced from 37.5 to 2.07 mg l(-1), nitrate from 33.3 to 1.23 mg l(-1), and phosphorus from 2.63 to 0.53 mg l(-1). Trace metals were also reduced up to 79.5% for iron, 91.4% for nickel, 91.8% for manganese, 36.14% for lead, and 85.19% for chromium. The better persistence of inoculated bacteria was tracked in the root/shoot interior of P. australis, which suggest their potential role in improved pollutant reduction. It is thus concluded that bacterial-assisted FWs may be a suitable choice for the remediation of heavily polluted river water. Furthermore, a field-scale application of FWs for the on-site treatment of contaminated water on the Ravi river is recommended.

AB In this study, the effect of interaction between sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) and titania nanoparticle on viscosity of water was investigated over a wide shear rate ranges of 10-200 s(-1) at different temperatures, respectively. It was found that adding SDS or TiO2 into water could both reduce the viscosity of the suspension. When they are added together, a synergistic effect could be clearly found. The resulting viscosity is much lower than the cases when they are added separately under certain temperature. The lubricating effect of the nanoparticle and analogous micelle were proposed to explain the phenomenon.

AB In this work, BCN-TiO2(A + R) heterojunctions were constructed via a simple one-step calcination method as efficient photocatalysts for H-2 evolution. Simultaneously, an anatase/rutile phase-junction was also obtained due to the crystalline phase transformation that occurred during high-temperature calcination. The unique hetero-junction and phase-junction lead to the formation of an intimate interface and large contact area between two semiconductors and extended the visible-light absorption range. Therefore, BCN-TiO2(A + R) heterojunctions with a mixed anatase and rutile phase exhibit enhanced photocarrier separation efficiency, realizing an elevenfold increase in the electron lifetime compared to that of pure TiO2 and yielding a remarkable visible-light-driven H-2 evolution rate nearly 7.5 and 12.2 times higher than that of TiO2(A + R) and pure BCN, respectively. This work provides a new strategy for designing efficient water-splitting photocatalysts with highly efficient charge separation and transfer.

AB Novel hollow structure based on CuO modified V2O5 nano-string of pearls (V2O5/CuO NSPs) were synthesized via electrospinning technique. The achieved V2O5/CuO NSPs exhibit interesting shapes of string of pearls, endowed with transparent and hollow structure under TEM observation. The V2O5/CuO NSPs sensors demonstrated that the sensitivity (R-a/R-g = 8.8 at 500 ppm) towards acetone was 3.2 times as high as that of pristine V2O5 nanofibers (NFs) (R-a/R-g = 2.5 at 500 ppm) at 440 degrees C. The improved sensitivity may be ascribed to the formation of V2O5/CuO p-n heterojunctions at the interfaces, which elevates the barrier height and enlarges depleted electron region.

AB We theoretically investigate the excited-state dynamics of several geminally locked tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives in solution, to explore the relationship between bridged structures and their respective luminescent properties. The emission of 2ETPE is found to be weak due to the largest non-radiative decay rate with 9 orders of magnitude. Conversely, the favorable better conjugation induced by lone pairs and stronger rigidity provides 2OTPE with brightest emission. The competition between the enhanced conjugation and attenuated rigidity of 2STPE in comparison with 2MTPE result in their moderate emission. This work provides strategy for tuning the emission of the TPE derivatives via varying tethers.

And the coordination numbers of Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were 5.6, 6.7, 6.0 and 7.8, respectively. The ions' hydration structure including Cl- weakly depended on the counter-ions and concentrations. Moreover, ions primarily affected the structure and kinetics of ion's first hydration shell. As the concentrations increased, the RDFs for water slightly changed with decrease in the self-diffusion coefficients of water molecules and ions.

AB A trifunctional epoxy resin (TGPAP) with excellent thermal stability was cured by several novel curing agents through a facile and cost-effective approach. The temperature of maximum weight loss rate (T-peak) of cured TGPAP were up to 370 degrees C and 330 degrees C under N-2 and air atmospheres, which attributed to the synergistic effects between curing agents and TGPAP. The dissipative particle dynamics simulations also reveal that the curing agents with more functional groups and higher reactivity induce the higher cross-linking density, leading to better mechanical properties. The simulations well reproduced the experimental results and also predicted the effect of the curing agents on mechanical properties.

AB From the perspective of cellular-automaton and by exploiting the interactions between travelling and localized waves the Lorentz Excitable Lattice Gas Automata (LELGA) is proposed and applied to the optimization of Lennard-Jones (LJ) atomic clusters. Our approach exploits the fact that a reaction-diffusion phenomenon with self-localized excitations cells which behave like quasi-particles, could be potentially used to implement dynamical computation. As an example of collision-based computation in reaction-diffusion systems based on cellular automata we provided our experimental results for unbiased optimization of Lennard-Jones (LJ) atomic clusters. We also demonstrated that the proposed method has successfully located the known global minima of LJ clusters for configuration space size of N <= 383.

AB Indium selenide (InSe) is a promising two-dimensional photodetector material. However, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are easy to recombine in simplex InSe semiconductor. Here, we design InSe-based van der Waals heterostructure, InSe/antimonene (beta-Sb), based on first-principles. InSe/beta-Sb heterostructure possesses intrinsic type-II electronic structure. Simultaneously, the work function of InSe (beta-Sb) layer is -5.7 eV (-4.5 eV) which also promotes electrons transfer. In addition, the good optical absorption performance of InSe and beta-Sb sublayer is preserved in the heterostructure. Moreover, different stacking mode between InSe/beta-Sb does not affect the efficient carrier separation which is convenient to the application of optoelectronics.

AB The most direct method of studying Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model is the molecular dynamics simulation method. The phase transition of (PolyA/PolyT)(100) duplex into the denaturated state is studied in the PBD model by the method of collisional molecular-dynamical modeling. The temperature dependencies of the total energy and heat capacity of the duplex are calculated. Unlike other calculations, we have obtained a wide peak of heat capacity in the region of temperature transition. The approach applied can be used to calculate the statistical properties of the duplexes of any length and nucleotide composition as well as proteins and other macro-molecules.

AB The effect of NO on methane oxidation in O-2/NO combustion atmosphere was investigated using reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) calculations. It has been observed that, the conversion of NO could accelerate the oxidation of CH4. To provide a detailed description for this phenomenon, the corresponding kinetic behavior of nitrogen-containing compounds were systematically analyzed at atomistic level. It revealed that NO presented a two-fold impact with respect to CH4 oxidation, on one hand, the presence of NO enhanced CH4 consumption by converting HO2 into OH radical; on the other hand, the appearance of NO inhibited CH4 consumption by catalyzing chain-carrier recombination reaction.

AB The dielectric relaxation of polar-molecule reaction with linear reaction dynamics is studied via the reaction-diffusion equation in the spherical coordinate (the modified Smoluchowski-Debye equation) based on the self-consistent field approximation. The polarization of two kinds of reaction systems, the interacting system and the polarizable system, is derived. In the interacting system, the interaction of the polar molecules is dependent on the concentration of the molecules, resulting in the complex interacting behavior of the polarization process. In the polarizable system, the anisotropic polarizability gives rise to the complex behavior of the third harmonic.

AB The advantages of single-component white-light-emitting phosphor make it more important for n-UV-light emitting diodes with excellent properties and efficiency. Herein, the BiOCl:Dy3+ white-light-emitting phosphor was firstly prepared by high temperature solid-state reaction. And the crystal structure, luminescence properties, lifetime, and thermal quenching behavior were carried out in detail. The results revealed that the BiOCl:Dy3+ phosphor could be excited efficiently in a broad near ultraviolet (n-UV) light region, which matched well with the n-UV chips for w-LEDs. Under the excitation at 390 nm, the BiOCl:Dy3+ phosphor exhibited white light with three emission peaks centered at 481, 575, and 664 nm, respectively. The optimal doping concentration of Dy3+ ions was found to be x = 0.03, and exchange interaction was confirmed to result in the concentration quenching. Furthermore, when the test temperature turned up to 150 degrees C, the intensity of emission peaks at 481 and 575 nm could still remain 77.96% and 77.93% of the initial intensity at room temperature. With the their activation energy of 0.33 eV and 0.27 eV, the excellent thermal stability of the BiOCl:Dy3+ phosphor were confirmed. All these results indicated that this as-prepared product could act as a high-performance phosphor candidate for n-UV w-LED application.

AB Carbon supported Pt and Pt1Mn3 (20 wt%) electrocatalysts were synthesized by impregnation method using NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The catalysts were physically characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) were investigated by potentiodynamic and potentiostatic measurements with POEMS (Pinhole On-line Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry) that allow the detection of volatile intermediates/products of the EOR. The potentiodynamic and potentiostatic results show that, although kinetics of the reaction is faster on Pt/C, Pt1Mn3/C electrocatalyst exhibit higher ethanol oxidation efficiency, and, incomplete ethanol oxidation reaction to acetaldehyde and acetic acid prevails under the conditions selected in this study for two electrocatalysts. After calibration of the m/z = 44 mass signal, the CO2 current efficiencies (CCEs) were calculated on the synthesized electrocatalysts: the CCE value reach up to similar to 9% on Pt1Mn3/C at 25 degrees C compared to ca. similar to 7% on Pt/C, which identifies that the addition of Mn enhances the oxidation of CO to CO2.

AB To obtain more accurate optical properties, we optimize the oxygen vacancy in gamma-LiAlO2 with three different charges (0, +1, +2) to study the optical spectrum line shapes of the oxygen vacancy, and the defect formation energies are corrected by finite-size correction scheme (FNV). We obtain the optical spectra containing electron-phonon coupling. The absorption spectra of the F center and F+ center peak at 4.6 eV and 5.5 eV, which are close to the experimental result. So we predicate that the absorption band peak at 5.21 eV should be the origin of the F+ center. The luminescence peaks of the F center and F+ center are at 2.98 eV and 2.56 eV, respectively. Comparing with the experimental results, the emission peak (3.02 eV) is caused by the F center.

AB In this study, three minerals were chosen as the host of colorimetric humidity sensor, and Bromothymol blue (BTB) was used as the indicator. The BTB based on titanium dioxide (BTB-TiO2), BTB based on palygorskite (BTB-palygorskite) and BTB based on mullite (BTB-mullite) exhibited the readable response to the relative humidity (RH) of 11, 43 and 75% at 1 min at 25 degrees C. Moreover, the BTB-palygorskite exhibited the rapid and stable color response, especially under the low humidity (11% RH). The surface area played an important role on the cover density of BTB and water adsorption which made the humidity sensor with excellent performances.

AB To shed more insight into the regioselectivities observed in the reactions between 3,5-diaminopyrazoles and N-acyl imidates or N-ethoxy imidate yielding the corresponding substituted pyrazolo[1,5-a]-[1,3,5] triazines or pyrazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5] triazinones, DFT calculations are carried out using B3LYP/6-31 + + G (d, p) method. The favored mechanism and the experimental regioselectivity of this reaction are rationalized by calculations of activation energy, natural atomic charge, and Fukui indexes derived from density functional theory. The present study shows that the experimental trends of the relative reactivities and regioselectivities of these reactions are correctly predicted using these computational levels.

AB Internal structural and dynamics of untreated and the enzyme treated natural cellulose were studied by C-13 cross polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) spectral analysis and relaxation measurements. C-13 spectral analysis indicates the susceptible degradation of the amorphous region of cellulose-microfibril due to enzyme-treatment. Spin-lattice relaxation time of chemically different carbon sites is decreased in enzyme-treated cellulose, which suggests that the polysaccharide chain becomes depolymerised. Relaxometry measurement also suggests that rice straw is more susceptible for degradation than sugar cane bagasse.

AB The mean oxidation state of cationic elements in Pr2NiO4+delta was studied using XANES measurements versus temperature in air. Unexpectedly, praseodymium is solely found as Pr3+ while Pr4+ was also foreseeable. Pr3+ cation is well accommodated in the large rare-earth site with the nine-fold coordination in this K2NiF4 - T-type structure; conversely, the small size of the Pr4+ cation seems not compatible with this site. Moreover, XANES measurements show a progressive decrease of the mean oxidation state of nickel ions when the temperature increases. It is directly correlated to the decrease of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the material evidenced by TGA measurements.

AB We develop a thermodynamically consistent version of the random phase approximation for multicomponent mixtures. The developed approach makes it possible, in particular, to accurately take into account the free volume effect on the entropy of mixing and steric interactions between the molecules. Further, we apply the developed theory to derive the total structure factor, equation of state and density correlation length of a multicomponent polymer blend. We demonstrate that the developed theory adequately reproduces the results of the small angle neutron scattering experiments for the structure factor of the investigated ternary polymer blend.

AB Energetics and electronic properties of three-layered hBN nanoribbons, with reconstructed edges, were investigated, using density functional theory. Such edges present lines of pentagonal and heptagonal rings, where homopolar B-B and N-N bonds exist. The homopolar bonds and their distribution, determine the energetic stability of hBN nanoribbons. The structures with the lowest amount of homopolar bonds presents a value of formation energy smaller than the single hBN layer, which suggests that such kind of reconstruction may indeed occur in real three-layered hBN systems. In addition, our results suggest that reconstructed edges on hBN nanoribbons are more stable than their carbon counterparts.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of producing seedlings of native tree species, based on plantlets emerged in soil seed bank, in order to use them in ecological restoration projects and to test the best environment (mature forest, initial forest, Eucalyptus sp. and Pinus sp. stands) and season (dry and rainy) for seed collection in this bank. Twenty soil seed bank samples (0.25 x 0.30 x 0.05 m) from each environment and sampling season were transported to a shade house, where they remained under favorable seed germination conditions. The emerged plantlets were rescued from the seed bank and transplanted to plastic bags in order to produce seedlings, which were evaluated based on growth (height and diameter) and survival rate. One hundred and ninety-two seedlings from the rainy season, and 119 from the dry season, were produced. Results indicated that seedlings of semideciduous seasonal forest-native tree species can be produced from plantlets emerged in soil seed banks, as well as that the collection in these banks should be carried out during the rainy season and in initial-to-medium-stage succession environments.

ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; UNINTENDED PREGNANCY; POSITIVE COUPLES;
   EDUCATION; HIV; ADHERENCE; IMPACT; WOMEN
AB Objectives: We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of electronic health education tools designed to improve knowledge, attitudes or practices related to contraception.
   Methods: Eligible studies consisted of English-language reports published after 1990 that quantified the effects of an electronic intervention on any of the following outcomes: contraceptive knowledge, attitude toward contraceptives, contraceptive method choice, contraceptive use or pregnancy. We conducted a systematic search of multiple electronic databases including MEDLINE, Global Health, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library and Grey Literature Report. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for reporting.
   Results: Of 143 full-text reports assessed for eligibility, 13 studies described in 16 reports were eligible for inclusion. Of six studies that evaluated video interventions, all were randomized controlled trials, and four reported any statistically significant difference between intervention groups on knowledge, method choice or pregnancy. Of seven studies of interactive computer applications, five were randomized controlled trials, and two were nonrandomized comparison studies. Four of these seven studies found statistically significant difference between study arms in contraceptive knowledge, attitudes or contraceptive use. While most differences favored the intervention, effects were generally limited with respect to clinical relevance and the number of outcomes impacted.
   Conclusions: Published assessments of electronic interventions for improving contraception-related outcomes are limited. Formal evaluations of interventions and publication of results are needed to determine the efficacy of electronic tools for contraceptive education and guide development of new interventions.

TI Neurovascular anatomy of the adult female medial arm in relationship to
   potential sites for insertion of the etonogestrel contraceptive implant
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Neurovascular anatomy; Contraceptive implant; Etonogestrel implant;
   Nerve injury
ID NERVE; REMOVAL
AB Objective: Anatomic assessment of the medial upper arm to identify potential sites for insertion of the etonogestrel (ENG) implant.
   Study design: Forty female cadaveric arms were dissected. Two rows of 1x2-cm dissection windows were created in the inner arm overlying the triceps approximately 2-3 and 4-5 cm posterior to the bicipital sulcus (sulcus). The primary window was 8-10 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle and approximately 2-3 cm posterior to the sulcus. Neurovascular structures within each window were identified. The entire medial upper arm was dissected to visualize underlying structures.
   Results: Mean age ( SD) of cadavers at death was 72.0+11.0 years. Arm measurements at the primary window were circumference 28.2+4.8 cm [range: 21-41], skin thickness 0.6+0.2 mm [0.3-1.0] and subcutaneous tissue thickness: 12.3+4.9 mm [4.7-21]. The basilic vein and the medial brachial cutaneous, ulnar and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves were located in 40%, 58%, 40% and 18% of the primary windows, respectively. No major neurovascular structures were located 3-5 cm posterior to the sulcus. More neurovascular structures were identified overlying the biceps than triceps. Elbow flexion with the hand underneath the head displaced the ulnar nerve anteriorly towards the sulcus.
   Conclusion: As no major neurovascular structures were identified overlying the triceps 8-10 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle and 3-5 cm posterior to the sulcus, ENG implant insertion at this location may minimize risk of injury associated with improper deep insertion. Elbow flexion deflects the ulnar nerve away from this area and may further decrease risk of injury secondary to inadvertent deep insertion.
   Implications: Although a limited cadaver study, this anatomic assessment provides rationale for insertion of the ENG implant overlying the triceps 8-10 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle and 3-5 cm posterior to the sulcus. This area is theoretically safer for insertion of the ENG implant than areas of the inner arm where major neurovascular structures are commonly located. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MIGRATION
AB Objectives: We conducted this study to characterize the frequency of insertion-, localization- and removal-related events and their clinically significant consequences among Nexplanon (etonogestrel radiopaque contraceptive implant) users in the United States during standard clinical practice.
   Study design: The Nexplanon Observational Risk Assessment (NORA) study was a large, prospective cohort study conducted in the United States. A total of 428 Health Care Professionals (HCPs) who had completed the Nexplanon clinical training program recruited women who were newly prescribed Nexplanon. We collected data on insertion-, localization- and removal-related events experienced during routine clinical practice via questionnaires completed by patients and HCPs. Recruitment began in December 2011 and follow-up ended in October 2017. Data analysis characterized the frequency of procedure-related events.
   Results: We collected data on 7364 insertion procedures. The incidence of incorrect insertion (i.e., initially unrecognized non-insertion, partial insertion or deep insertion) was 12.6 per 1000 insertions (95% Cl, 10.2-15.5). Pins and needles/numbness in the arm/hand/fingers was the most common patient-reported event. We obtained data on 5159 removal procedures, of which all were successful but one (due to the location of the implant in deep muscle tissue). No implants were localized outside the arm. The most common challenge reported by HCPs during implant removal was encasement of the implant within fibrotic tissue.
   Conclusions: Events associated with the insertion, localization and removal of the Nexplanon contraceptive implant were rare and their clinical consequences were generally not suggestive of serious injury. Implications: This study is the largest prospective evaluation of events associated with insertion and removal of Nexplanon during routine clinical practice. It demonstrates that complications associated with insertion and removal of Nexplanon are rare when performed by trained clinicians. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Relationship between patient characteristics and serum etonogestrel
   concentrations in contraceptive implant users
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Body mass index; Contraceptive implant; Etonogestrel; Pharmacokinetics
AB Objective: To determine whether serum etonogestrel concentrations in contraceptive implant users are associated with certain individual patient characteristics.
   Study design: We enrolled reproductive-age women using etonogestrel contraceptive implants between 12-36 months duration and measured a single serum etonogestrel concentration. Participants also completed a questionnaire about demographics.
   Results: We enrolled 350 participants: median age was 22.5 years (range 18.0-39.1), median months of implant use was 26.0 (range 12.0-36.0), and median body mass index was 25.7 kg/m(2) (range 18.5-52.0). Our study population was primarily white/Caucasian (46.6% [163/350]) and Hispanic/Latina ethnicity (51.4% [180/350]). The median serum etonogestrel concentration was 137.4 pg/ml and etonogestrel concentrations varied 12.4 fold in the population (range 55.8-695.1 pg/ml). Using forward stepwise linear regression, months of implant use ([3= 1.74, p<.001) and body mass index ([3= 3.10, p<.001) were both significantly associated with decreased serum etonogestrel concentration with Black/African American race as a positive effect modifier ([3=18.24, p=.099); R-squared for the model=0.13.
   Conclusions: Individuals demonstrated a wide variability in serum etonogestrel concentrations, which can potentially affect side-effect profiles and efficacy. Increasing body mass index and longer duration of implant use were associated with small decreases in serum etonogestrel concentrations, while self-reported Black/African American race was associated with a non-significant increase. Despite these findings, most of etonogestrel variability was unaccounted for, suggesting that other clinical, pharmacologic, and genetic factors contributing to variability in etonogestrel concentrations remain to be determined.
   Implications: Although increases in body mass index are associated with lower etonogestrel levels in contraceptive implant users, the majority of women will maintain serum concentrations that consistently suppress ovulation. Furthermore, certain patient characteristics can only explain a small portion (13%) of the variability in serum etonogestrel levels among contraceptive implant users. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI Impact of the contraceptive implant on maternal and neonatal morbidity

   cohort study
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article

   New Guinea; Reproductive health; Contraception
ID UNMET NEED
AB Objectives: Using routinely collected birth data, this study sought to measure changes in maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality after introduction of the levonorgestrel contraceptive implant into a large, rural island population in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
   Study design: We conducted a retrospective observational study of birth records from 4251 births that occurred between January 2010 and December 2016 on Karkar Island, PNG. The primary outcome was the change in crude birth rate (CBR) before (2010-2012) and after (2014-2016) introduction of the implant. Secondary outcomes were the change in rates (per year/1000 births) of severe postpartum hemorrhage, postpartum infection, hospital readmission, prematurity (<37 weeks), low birth weight (<2500 g) and maternal and neonatal mortality. We also studied changes in the number of pregnancies affected by grand multiparity (4) and short interpregnancy interval (<12 months) for the same time periods. Data were analyzed using interrupted time series and Poisson regression.
   Results: CBR was stable until 2012 and then declined from 2014 (p<.0001). Following introduction of the implant, the annual rate/1000 births of selected adverse birth outcomes decreased between 56% and 74% (p<.0001). The number of women with parity who gave birth decreased by 59% (p<.0001), and the number with interpregnancy interval <12 months decreased by 64% (p<.0001).
   Conclusions: Introduction of the contraceptive implant was associated with reductions in CBR, maternal and neonatal morbidity, and the number of women with high-risk pregnancies giving birth.
   Implications: These results encourage efforts to increase knowledge and availability of the contraceptive implant in low- and middle-income countries such as PNG. In cases where it reduces the CBR and the number of women with high-risk pregnancies birthing, the implant may have a beneficial impact on maternal and neonatal morbidity.

ID BREAST-FEEDING WOMEN; RISK-FACTORS; INFANT; INITIATION; MOTHERS
AB Objective: To estimate the proportion of women for whom use of hormonal contraception was associated with reporting a decreased breast milk supply.
   Study design: The Lactational Effects of Contraceptive Hormones: an Evaluation ("LECHE") Study was an anonymous, internet-based, exploratory, cross-sectional survey of postpartum women using approximately 70 questions. Women were eligible to participate in the survey if they were 18 years or older, had a singleton infant between 3 and 9 months of age, had breastfed this infant for any amount of time and could read English. The survey included questions about breastfeeding, reproductive health, demographic characteristics and the timing of postpartum events.
   Results: A total of 3971 participants clicked on the survey. Our final study population included 2922 participants. Overall, 1201 (41%) reported having had milk supply concerns at some point in the first 12 weeks postpartum. The median time from birth until milk supply concerns was 3 weeks (IQR 1-7). Eight hundred fifty-two women (29%) started hormonal contraception in the first 12 weeks postpartum. Fifteen percent (127/852) of women reported new or additional milk supply concerns after starting hormonal contraception. Reported milk supply concerns were higher for women who used hormonal contraception than those who did not (44% vs. 40%; p=.05) Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) assessing the association between contraceptive use and time to milk supply concerns were not statistically significant (HR 1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.94-1.47 for any type of hormonal contraception).
   Conclusions: This study found a slightly increased proportion of reported milk supply concerns among women who started hormonal contraception.
   Implications: It is important for caregivers in the postpartum period to recognize the potential for multiple factors, including initiation of hormonal contraception, to affect breastfeeding. Patient-centered counseling can help elicit women's values and preferences regarding breastfeeding and pregnancy prevention. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

   Difference-in-difference analysis; Knowledge; Satisfaction
ID ULIPRISTAL ACETATE; KNOWLEDGE; LEVONORGESTREL; PERCEPTIONS; PREGNANCY
AB Objective: This study assesses emergency contraception (EC) dispensed before and after a 3-min video counseling intervention on EC.
   Methods: We used a quasi-experimental design and two data sources to assess the impact of offering the video counseling intervention. We used electronic health records from six Planned Parenthood Association of Utah health centers with onsite oral EC dispensing to determine pre- and postintervention EC distribution. Beginning July 2015, three participating locations offered the video counseling intervention to English-speaking EC clients. These clients completed a brief survey assessing EC knowledge and uptake, providing a patient-level data source. We used a difference-in-difference analysis of the clinic-level data to assess the effect of the video counseling intervention. This analysis compares the variation in oral EC distribution between clinics offering the video intervention and clinics not offering the video counseling before and after the video counseling was introduced. Multivariable logistic regression assessed client characteristics associated with receiving ulipristal.
   Results: The six health centers served 8269 English-language EC clients during 2015. At participating sites, provision of ulipristal increased from 12% (269/2315) preintervention to 28% (627/2266) postintervention (p<.001). Nonparticipating sites did not see a change. Clients seeking EC at sites offering video counseling were more likely to receive ulipristal even after controlling for age, insurance and ethnicity (adjusted OR 3.4, 95% CI 3.0-3.9). Using the difference-in-difference analysis, the video counseling intervention accounted for an 18% (95% CI 14%-21%) increase in ulipristal provision at the participating health centers. Among the 2266 women seeking EC who were offered video counseling, 19% (425/2266) watched the video, and 60% (254/425) reported the video affected their EC preferences. Knowledge of the IUD for EC increased, but reported uptake of this method remained low ( 6.8%).
   Conclusions: Exposure to video counseling increased use of more effective oral EC and increased knowledge about all EC options. Implications: Use of a brief informational video about EC options at family planning clinics may increase the proportion of EC clients receiving more effective EC methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ID POLYURETHANE CONDOM; BREAKAGE; LATEX; SLIPPAGE
AB Objectives: This study compared the condom failure rate, safety and acceptability of two new synthetic adhesive male condoms, Wondaleaf-Cap (R) (WLC) and Wondaleaf-On-Man (R) (WLM), with a marketed latex external condom Durex-Together (DT).
   Study design: We enrolled healthy married, monogamous, heterosexual condom users in a randomized controlled, cross-over, pilot trial in Malaysia. We randomized participants to six groups with different condom use-orders of the experimental WLC and WLM and control latex condom for four episodes for vaginal sex over 1 month for each condom type. We summarized the clinical and non-clinical failure rate, safety and acceptability of each condom type using descriptive statistics. We tested differences in condom failure and acceptability using generalized estimating equations and repeated measure ANOVA respectively.
   Results: We screened 75 couples and randomized 50 eligible couples. Two couples withdrew before receiving any condom. The remaining used 576 condoms with 192 uses for each condom variant. Clinical failure rates of WLC, WLM and DT were 1.04%, 0% and 0.52%, respectively. Non-clinical failure rates of WLC, WLM and DT were 2.08%, 3.12% and 1.04%, respectively. Removal was found more painful with Wondaleaf products than the DT. Preferences of participants for WLC, WLM and DT were 33.3%, 29.2% and 25%, respectively. Overall, WLC and DT had greater acceptances among male participants than WLM.
   Conclusion: Results of this pilot study support that use of synthetic adhesive male condoms is associated with failure rates similar to those seen with existing latex, and with greater acceptability. A larger study to ascertain non inferiority is underway.
   Implications: The availability of synthetic adhesive male condoms may increase the acceptability of condom use. However, removal pain and clinical performance requires further study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To explore perspectives on family planning among young people who perceive they are infertile or will have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term owing to medical conditions or procedures. Methods: This exploratory analysis examined pregnancy plans and contraceptive behavior among 12 young adults with a diagnosed medical condition or who had undergone a medical procedure associated with impaired fertility, and who had discussed fertility with a healthcare provider. We utilized data from a larger study investigating prospective pregnancy intentions and plans among 50 young (ages 18-24) women and their male partners (n=100).
   Results: Medical conditions included endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and lupus. For some, medical conditions/procedures led to use of no or less effective contraception; perceived risk for pregnancy was low, though seven participants had previously experienced pregnancies. Participants also described how medical conditions altered their timelines for pregnancy and overall desire for children; for example, one participant described continuing an unplanned pregnancy because she feared it would be her only chance to parent.
   Conclusion: This exploratory analysis suggests that among young people, medical issues perceived to affect fertility and pregnancy may influence pregnancy planning and contraceptive behavior. Young people may lack knowledge about fertility and the impact of a medical condition; thus it is critical that providers clarify the difference between anticipated difficulty conceiving and complete infertility. Tailored contraceptive care is needed for young adults with medical conditions that may affect fertility to ensure they have the necessary information to make informed family planning decisions.
   Implications: Medical conditions known to affect fertility may influence young people's family planning desires and behaviors. Understanding how young adults process information about medical conditions' impact on their fertility and change or make plans in response is important in order to best meet their family planning needs.

TI "It's not something you talk about really": information barriers

SO CONTRACEPTION

DT Article

   pregnancy options counseling; United States; Qualitative
ID UNITED-STATES; REFERRALS; SERVICES
AB Objective: For individuals traveling significant distances for time-sensitive abortion care, accurate information about service options and locations is critical, but little is known regarding information barriers that individuals may encounter and strategies for circumventing these barriers.
   Study design: In early 2015, we conducted in-depth interviews with 29 patients who had traveled for abortion care at six facilities in Michigan and New Mexico. We identified information-related barriers that respondents encountered in understanding their pregnancy options and/or where to obtain an abortion between the time of pregnancy discovery, including any contact with a crisis pregnancy center, to the day of the abortion procedure through inductive and deductive analysis.
   Results: We identified two logistical information-related barriers a general lack of reproductive-related knowledge and unhelpfulness on the part of perceived members of the healthcare community and one broader barrier of perceived stigma within respondents' narratives. Of the seven respondents who did not encounter a logistical information-related barrier, having previous personal or close experience with abortion and internet sawiness were both identified as strategies enabling them to circumvent the barriers.
   Conclusion: Lack of clear, easy-to-find and accurate information about abortion services and availability represents a key barrier to obtaining an abortion; health care providers play a crucial role in ensuring pregnant patients' right to informed consent within reproductive health care delivery.
   Implications: Women's health care providers should provide their patients with the full spectrum of resources and referrals for pregnancy and abortion care; recent federal guidelines proposing to restrict abortion counseling and referral at Title X-funded facilities would only exacerbate the current challenges that pregnant patients encounter when seeking abortion-related information and further decrease linkages to timely, desired abortion care.

AB Proteolytic activation of the IL-33 precursor, full-length interleukin-33 (FLIL33), at multiple sites within the sensor domain (aa 95-109) yields several functionally mature (MIL33) forms. Unlike nuclear FLIL33, intracellular MIL33 occurs in the cytoplasm, is secreted from source cells, and exerts biological effects by activating the ST2 receptor on target cells. Previous studies and our findings in this report indicated that IL-33 forms that are substantially longer than those produced by cleavage within the sensor domain are biologically indistinguishable from classical MIL33. We utilized a series of human and mouse N-terminal FLIL33 mutants to narrow down the boundaries of the nuclear localization sequence to aa 46-67, a segment known to include a portion of the chromatin-binding motif as well as another site controlling intracellular stability of FLIL33 in an importin-5-dependent fashion. The N-terminal FLIL33 deletion mutants starting prior to this region were intranuclear, non-secreted in cell culture, and manifested modest functional activity in vivo, similar to FLIL33. By contrast, the mutants starting after this region were cytoplasmic, secreted from cells in culture, and overtly biologically active in vivo, similar to MIL33. The deletion mutants starting within this region manifested an intermediate phenotype between FLIL33 and MIL33. Thus, this segment of IL-33 molecule controls multiple aspects of its biology, including subcellular localization, extracellular secretion, and functional maturation into the longest possible form of mature IL-33 cytokine. Future anti-IL-33 therapies may be based on interfering with this segment, thus restraining extracellular release and maturation of IL-33 into the active cytokine.

AB The interferon (IFN) family of cytokines is a crucial part of the host's ability to mount an effective immune response against viral infections. In addition to establishing an antiviral state within cells, IFNs also support the optimal activation of other key immune cell types. The ability of members of the Flaviviridae family to suppress type I IFN responses has been well-described. Of these viruses, Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently attracted international attention due to a series of major outbreaks that featured the novel association of neurological symptoms with infection. Researchers have begun to investigate the strategies ZIKV uses to evade type I IFNs, and the impact this has on the host. However, a unique feature of ZIKV infection compared to other flaviviruses is its capacity to be transmitted sexually, as well as its ability to infect and persist within reproductive tissues. As such, this raises the question of a potential role for type III IFN during ZIKV infection. In this review, we will discuss the interplay between these two classes of IFN with ZIKV, models that have been used to interrogate these interactions, and the effect this interplay has on infection and infection outcomes. We will also consider the intriguing possibility of whether ZIKV has evolved improved evasion mechanisms to suppress the IFN response in recent outbreaks.

AB In response to viral pathogens, a host releases pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10). While several approaches exist to measure cytokine responses, evaluating gene transcription through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) provides a fast, reproducible, and sensitive method for quantifying this response. The objective of this study was to develop an effective and sensitive RT-qPCR assay for the quantification of red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) and eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina) cytokines: IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, IL-10 and the reference gene beta-actin. RNA was isolated from the buffy coat layer of whole blood, comprised mainly of circulating leukocytes, and complimentary DNA (cDNA) was produced. Conventional PCR was performed to obtain cytokine mRNA sequences, products were sequenced, and a hydrolysis probe-based RT-qPCR assay was designed for each cytokine. Standard curves were generated using the target gene sequences cloned within a plasmid. Efficiencies for each assay were between of 85-110%, R-2 > 0.98, and limits of detection of 10-100 copies per reaction. The initial samples used to identify the novel target sequences were then used to evaluate the performance of the qPCR assays. Consistent transcription of beta actin across individuals in both species and measurable transcription of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 transcript targets in individuals of both species were observed. The assays are a novel technique in chelonians to evaluate host innate immune response.

AB IL-36 cytokines are critical regulators of mucosal inflammation and homeostasis. IL-36 gamma regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial proteins by gingival epithelial cells (e.g. TIGK cells). Here, we show that IL-36 gamma also regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), important mediators of antimicrobial immunity and tissue homeostasis in mucosal epithelia. MMP9 and NGAL were not similarly induced by IL-17 or IL-22, thus indicating the importance of IL-36 gamma in the regulation of MMP9 and NGAL. Mechanistically, MMP9 and NGAL expression was demonstrated to be induced in an IRAK1- and NF-kappa B-dependent manner. Furthermore, signaling by p38 MAP kinase may enable their expression to be independently regulated by IL-36 gamma. The stronger IL-36 gamma-inducible expression of MMP9 and NGAL in terminally differentiating TIGK cells suggests that control of their expression is associated with the maturation of the gingival epithelium. Although MMP9 and NGAL expression in epithelial cells can also be induced by bacteria, their expression in TIGK cells was not induced by the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, most likely due to antagonism by the gingipain proteinase virulence factors. This study advances our understanding of how IL-36 gamma may promote oral mucosal immunity and tissue homeostasis, and how this may be dysregulated by bacterial pathogens.

DE Asthma; IFN-lambda s; Th2 cytokines; Intranasal inhalation
AB The possibility has been suggested that interferon (IFN)-lambda s can be induced rapidly for restricting respiratory viral infection in asthmatic mice and may modulate Th2-related immune responses that underlie the pathogenesis of asthma. We sought to determine the in vivo contribution of IFN-lambda s on decrease of Th2 cytokines in the respiratory tract of in vivo asthma. Lungs of asthmatic mice were severely inflamed, with extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and increased goblet cell metaplasia with higher total lung resistance. The mean protein levels of TSLP and IL-33 from BAL fluid of asthmatic mice were significantly higher until 7 days. Following the collection of lung tissue of 20 asthmatic mice, TSLP and IL-33 gene expressions inversely correlated with mRNA levels of IFN-lambda(2/3). Asthmatic mice were administered recombinant IFN-lambda(2/3) via the intranasal route and the mRNA levels of IFN-stimulated genes were elevated to an even greater extent in the lung tissue of the mice without intranasal IFN-lambda(2/3). Asthma-related histopathologic lung inflammation was significantly improved and total lung resistance was maintained within normal range in IFN-lambda(2/3)-treated asthmatic mice. Moreover, IFN-lambda(2/3)-treated asthmatic mice exhibited significant decrease of secreted protein levels of TSLP and IL-33 in the BAL fluid until 7 days after IFN administration. The current data provide compelling evidence that the compensation of IFN-lambda s can restrict the secretion of epithelial-derived Th2 cytokines, accompanied with reduced asthmatic immunopathology and IFN-lambda s are critical for limiting Th2-mediated allergic responses in allergic asthma.

AB We examined the precise association between IL-10 levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prognosis and explored the pleiotropic role of IL-10 in different cardiac pathologies. We performed a meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating IL-10 levels. Meta-regression analyses were used to determine the cause of the discrepancies. To assess publication bias, funnel plots were constructed, and Egger's tests were performed. Data from the GSE58015 dataset were used to investigate the levels of IL-10 under certain conditions. Because of substantial heterogeneity in the data used to compare the IL-10 levels between patients with CVD and healthy people, we could not determine the differences between the healthy controls and patients with ischemic or nonischemic pathologies (p > 0.05). The analysis of the association between IL-10 levels and CVD prognosis indicated that higher IL-10 levels were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in patients with nonischemic pathologies (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.00-1.20, p = 0.043) but differentially associated with the prognosis of patients with ischemic pathologies based on the sampling time point (before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): HR = 4.90, 95% CI = 1.24-19.30, p < 0.001; after PCI: HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.43-0.75, p = 0.023). The meta-regression analysis showed that the pooled HR of the IL-10 levels was positively correlated with the IL-10/IL-6 ratio (beta = 0.644, p = 0.024). The funnel plots and Egger's tests revealed no statistically significant bias in our meta-analysis (p > 0.1). Furthermore, our data mining analysis supported our findings. Our analysis showed that IL-10 levels may be pleiotropically associated with the CVD prognosis possibly based on the type of pathology, disease stage and levels of other proinflammatory factors, such as IL-6.

AB Background: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the standard-of-care therapy for chemotherapy associated neutropenia in patients with malignancies. Recent case reports have implied that G-CSF treatment may be associated with the development of aortitis, but the precise nature of the relationship is unclear. We investigated the association between G-CSF and risk for aortitis in patients with various malignancies.
   Methods: We performed an observational study of 102,014 subjects with malignant neoplasms documented in the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database between April 2004 and February 2018. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for aortitis in patients treated and not treated with G-CSF were estimated using multivariate logistic regression with R software.
   Results: Among the 102,014 subjects, 25 developed aortitis. Of the 3409 and 98,630 subjects treated and not treated with G-CSF, 16 (0.47% [95% CI; 0.27, 0.76]) and 9 (0.01% [0.00, 0.02]) developed aortitis, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated an association between G-CSF and aortitis (adjusted OR 45.87 [19.16, 109.8], p < 0.001). The values for filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, and lenograstim were 0.25% (0.07, 0.63), 1.58% (0.79, 2.81), and 0.24% (0.05, 0.69), respectively.
   Conclusion: G-CSF treatment was associated with a signal of increased risk for aortitis among patients with malignant neoplasms. Three different G-CSF agents were associated with such risk, implying that it is a class effect. However, we do not recommend changing G-CSF prescriptions, because our results may have been influenced by the limitations of the JADER database and because the benefit of G-CSF treatment outweighs the potential risk.

AB The present study aimed to assess the kinetics of cytokine release and compare the accuracy of serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) associated with Kawasaki disease (KD). Serum neopterin, interleukin (IL)-18, IL-6 and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type I (sTNFR-I) and sTNFR-II levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 78 patients with KD, including five with MAS. Results were compared to the clinical features of MAS. Serum neopterin, IL -18, sTNFR-II levels and sTNFR-II/I ratio were significantly elevated in KD patients with MAS compared to those in the acute phase. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed areas under the curve and cutoff values of neopterin, IL -18, sTNFR-II levels and sTNFR-II/I ratio were 0.9750/30.0 nmol/L, 0.9813/1165 ng/mL, 0.9969/16,600 pg/mL and 0.9875/4.475, respectively. Serum sTNFR-II levels correlated positively with disease activity. These findings indicate that overproduction of interferon (IFN)-gamma and TNF-alpha reflected by increased serum levels of neopterin and sTNFR-II are closely associated with the pathogenesis of MAS associated with KD. Serum sTNFR-II levels might be a useful marker to diagnose the transition to MAS.

AB Chronic moderate-intensity exercise is an efficient non-pharmacological strategy to prevent and treat several diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, cancers, and Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, improving an athlete's performance requires completing high-intensity and volume exercise sessions. When the delicate balance between high-load exercise sessions and adequate recovery periods is disrupted, excessive training (known as overtraining) can lead to performance decline. The cytokine hypothesis considers that an imbalance involving excessive exercise and inadequate recovery induces musculoskeletal trauma, increasing the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), which interact with different organic systems, initiating most of the signs and symptoms linked to performance decrement. This leading article used recent data to discuss the scientific basis of Smith's cytokine theory and highlighted that the adverse effects of excessive exercise go beyond performance decline, proposing a multi-organ approach for this issue. These recent insights will allow coaches and exercise physiologists to develop strategies to avoid chronic excessive exercise-induced adverse outcomes.

AB Background: The adipocytokines eNampt and resistin are involved in the regulation of inflammation exerting pro-inflammatory actions. Our aim was to jointly investigate whether circulating eNampt and resistin, and their kinetics predict 28-day mortality of sepsis.
   Methods: In a prospective study, serum eNampt and resistin were determined in 102 critically ill patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of SEPSIS-3, at enrollment and one week after, and in 102 healthy controls matched on age, gender and month of diagnosis.
   Results: Serum eNampt and resistin were significantly higher in septic patients than controls (p < 0.001), and higher in septic shock compared to sepsis (p < 0.001). Both eNampt and resistin decreased significantly during the first week of sepsis (p < 0.001). However, patients with septic shock presented a sustained elevation of eNampt and resistin compared to patients with sepsis. Both adipocytokines were positively correlated with sepsis severity scores and lactate. Baseline eNampt was a better discriminator of sepsis and septic shock compared to C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. Serum eNampt and resistin were higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors during the first week of sepsis. Prolonged and sustained elevation of both eNampt and resistin, as reflected by a lower percentage change from their baseline values, was independently associated with 28-day mortality (HR: 0.05, 95% C.I. 0.01-0.28, p = 0.001; HR: 0.19, 95% C.I. 0.07-0.50, p = 0.001, respectively), after adjustment for significant clinical and laboratory biomarkers.
   Conclusion: Circulating eNampt and resistin, and their kinetics may represent useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in critically ill septic patients. More prospective studies are needed to elucidate their ontological and pathophysiological role in sepsis.

AB Background: Adiponectin exhibits anti-inflammatory actions and is mainly expressed in adipose tissue. However, recent studies have shown that adiponectin can also be secreted by skeletal muscle fibers with autocrine and paracrine effects.
   Objectives: To analyze the role of adiponectin in the metabolic and inflammatory response of skeletal muscle after acute exhaustive aerobic exercise.
   Methods: C57BL/6 (WT) and adiponectin knockout (AdKO) mice underwent four days of treadmill running adaptation and at the fifth day, they performed an incremental maximum test to determine the maximum speed (Vmax). Acute exercise consisted of one hour at 60% Vmax. Mice were euthanatized 2 and 24 h after acute exercise session.
   Results: Serum and gastrocnemius adiponectin increased after 2-hours of acute exercise. NEFA concentrations were lower in non-exercise AdKO, and decreased 2-hours after exercise only in WT. No differences were found in muscle triacylglycerol content; however, glycogen content was higher in AdKO in non-exercise (p-value = 0.005). WT showed an increase in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation 2-hours after exercise and its level went back to normal after 24-hours. Otherwise, exercise was not able to modify AMPK in the same way as in AdKO. WT showed an increase in the phosphorylation of ACC (Ser79) 2-hours after exercise and return to normal after 24-hours of exercise (p-value < 0.05), kinects that was not observed in AdKO mice. IL-10 and IL-6 concentration was completely different among genotypes. In WT, these cytokines were increased at 2 (p-value < 0.01) and 24 h (p-value < 0.001) after exercise when compared with AdKO. NF-kappa Bp65 protein and gene expression were not different between genotypes.
   Conclusion: Adiponectin influences muscle metabolism, mainly by the decrease in exercise-induced AMPK phosphorylation, inflammatory profile and IL-6 in the muscle.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is always accompanied by persistent inflammation of liver tissues, which is considered to exert protumourigenic effects by promoting cancer growth, progression, and metastasis. However, the tumour-promoting roles and predictive value of intratumoural inflammatory cytokines remain unclear. In the present study, we used database analysis, clinical pathological studies, and in vitro biological experiments on human hepatic cancer cell lines to assess the prognostic potential of the primary tumour cytokine mRNA levels and underlying mechanisms in HCC. First, we assessed the prognostic value of several cytokines from the TCGA database and found that IL-8 is a unique cytokine that is associated with poor overall survival of HCC patients. Then, we collected 87 HCC tumour and adjacent non-tumour specimens from patients and confirmed that patients with low IL-8 expression exhibited less intrahepatic invasion or distant metastasis, a lower recurrence rate and longer overall survival time compared to patients with high IL-8 expression. Wound healing, transwell, and western blotting assay results showed that IL-8 promotes the migration and invasion of Huh-7 and HepG2 cells, and the underlying mechanism is that IL-8 induces the EMT of HCC cells via the IL-8/ERK1/2/SNAI1 and IL-8/STAT3/TWIST1 signalling pathways. These results provide valuable biological IL-8 information which needs to be further investigated in liver cancer target therapy research. Furthermore, the intratumoural cytokine expression at the mRNA level may provide insight into hepatocarcinoma prognosis.

AB Objective: To determine the value of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and aortic diameter in predicting in-hospital mortality in acute aortic dissection (AD).
   Methods: A single-center prospective study was designed in the setting of University hospital in China. 122 patients with acute AD were enrolled. Admission plasma NT-proBNP levels and aortic diameter were measured.
   Results: Plasma NT-proBNP concentrations (P < 0.001), aortic diameter (P = 0.002), and admission systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P = 0.011) were significantly increased in patients who died compared to those who survived during hospitalization. Furthermore, aortic diameter had positive correlations with NT-proBNP levels (r = 0.270, P = 0.003) and admission diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (r = 0.202, P = 0.025), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that NT-proBNP >= 569.75 pg/ml and aortic diameter >= 40 mm were strongly associated with in-hospital mortality. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were 3.246, 1.212-8.693 (P = 0.019); and 2.917, 1.102-7.722 (P = 0.031), respectively. Moreover, when NT-proBNP >= 1325.6 pg/ml, the sensitivity and specificity of NT-proBNP in predicting in-hospital mortality risk were 55.2% and 95.7% (95% CI, 0.707-0.891; P < 0.001), respectively. In addition, when aortic diameter >= 47 mm, the sensitivity and specificity were 58.6% and 88.2% (95% CI, 0.607-0.841; P < 0.001), respectively.
   Conclusions: NT-proBNP >= 569.75 pg/ml and aortic diameter >= 40 mm were important risk factors and independently associated with acute AD in-hospital mortality. NT-proBNP >= 1325.6 pg/ml or aortic diameter >= 47 mm showed higher specificity in predicting in-hospital mortality. Using NT-proBNP and aortic diameter together showed better performance in predicting in-hospital mortality with higher sensitivity.

AB We compared the chemokine/receptor expression in skin biopsies of discoid (SLE/DLE) and subacute lupus (SLE/SCLE) and correlated it with tissue and circulating effector CD4 T cells/regulatory cells. Skin biopsies and peripheral blood from 9 active SLE/DLE patients, 9 SLE/SCLE patients, 5 control SLE patients without cutaneous lesions and 10 control healthy donors were included. Clinical skin activity was measured by Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index scoring, and systemic activity was measured by a modified SLEDAI-2K excluding the cutaneous items. Pain and pruritus were evaluated by a 10-point visual analogue scale. To determine the frequencies of CXCL-10/CXCR3-, CCL2/CCR2-, CCL17/CCR4-, CCL20/CCR6-, CCL27/CCR10-, CXCL8/CXCR1-, CXCL13/CXCR5-, IL-22-, CD4/IL-17A-, CD4/IL-4-, CD4/IFN-gamma-, CD123/IDO-, CD25/Foxp3-, and CD20/IL-10-expressing cells, double immunostaining procedures were performed. Circulating CD4 +/CD161-/IL-22 +, CD4 +/CD161 +/IL-17 +, CD4 +/CD25-/IL-4 +, CD4 +/CD25-/IFN-gamma +, CD4 +/CD25hi/Foxp3 +, CD3 +/CD19 +/CD38hi/IL-10+, and CD123 +/CD196 +/IDO + cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
   Results: In the tissue, CXCL10, CXCR5, and CCL20 expression and IL-22 +, CD4 +/IL-17 +, CD4 +/IFN-gamma + and CD123+/IDO + cell percentages were increased in SLE/DLE versus SLE/SCLE. Circulating CD4 +/CD161-/IL-22 +, CD4 +/CD161 +/IL-17 +, CD4 +/CD25-/IFN-gamma +, CD19 +/CD38hi/IL-10 + and CD123 +/CD196 +/IDO + cell percentages were higher in SLE/DLE versus SLE/SCLE. In the tissue, we found positive correlations between CXCR3 and CD4 +/IL-17 + cells; CCR2 and CD4 +/IFN-gamma + cells; and CCR10 and CD123 +/IDO + cells in the SLE/DLE patients and between CXCL13 and CD20 +/IL-10 + cells in the SLE/SCLE patients. In the peripheral blood, we determined positive correlations between CXCR5 and CD4 +/CD25-/IFN-gamma + cells; CCL17 and CD4 +/CD161-/IL-22 + cells; and CCL17 and CD4 +/CD161 +/IL-17 + cells in the SLE/DLE patients and between CXCR5 and CD3 +/CD19 +/CD38hi/IL-10 + cells; CCR2 and CD4 +/CD25hi/Foxp3 + cells; and CXCR1 and CD4 +/CD25hi/Foxp3 + cells in the SLE/SCLE patients. Positive correlations between the pain score and the expression of CCL2 and CCR6 expression were found in the SLE/SCLE patients.
   In conclusion, the correlations between the expression of chemokines/receptors and subpopulations of effector/regulatory cells showed differential responses among the cutaneous pathologies.

AB Recent studies have provided overwhelming evidence of the involvement of microglia-related molecular networks in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The potential involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-18, IL-23 and IL-17 on amyloid (A beta) clearance is still unclear. In this study, we addressed that there might be a net relationship among IL-18, IL-23, and IL-17 and they can affect A beta clearance in cultured macrophage/microglia cells. In human macrophage cell line THP-1, A beta 42 incubation could increase the expression of IL-18, IL-23 and IL-17 in a concentration dependent manner. THP-1 cell could clear A beta 42 in the culture medium time-dependently, but its capacity of A beta clearance was impaired by IL-18, IL-23 or IL-17 treatment. Similarly, the capacity of the microglia cell line BV2 to clear A beta 42 was impaired by IL-18, IL-23 or IL-17 treatment. In co-cultures of BV2 with APP/PS1 neuron, A beta was efficiently cleared by BV2 cell, but A beta clearance was impaired by IL-18, IL-23 or IL-17 treatment. The effects of IL-18, IL-23 and IL-17 could be blocked by their corresponding neutralizing antibodies. In addition, the inhibitory effects of IL-18 were blocked by IL-23 or IL-17 neutralizing antibodies while the inhibitory effects of IL-23 were blocked by IL-17 neutralizing antibodies. Our study provides evidences showing that amyloid induced IL-18/IL-23/IL-17 axis could impair macrophage and microglia-mediated A beta clearance. Thus, IL-18/IL-23/IL-17 axis might be a therapeutic target in AD.

AB Neosporosis due to Neospora caninum causes abortions in farm animals such as cattle. No treatment and vaccine exist to fight this disease, responsible for considerable economic losses. It is thus important to better understand the immune responses occurring during the pathogenesis to control them in a global strategy against the parasite. In this context, we studied the roles of N. caninum glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), glycolipids defined as toxins in the related parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We demonstrated for the first time that GPIs could be excreted in the supernatant of N. caninum culture and trigger cell signalling through the Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. In addition, antibodies specific to N. caninum GPIs were detected in the serum of infected mice. As shown for other protozoan diseases, they could play a role in neutralizing GPIs. N. caninum GPIs were able to induce the production of tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin(IL)-1 beta and IL-12 cytokines by murine macrophages and dendritic cells. Furthermore, GPIs significantly reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of class I on murine dendritic cells. In contrast to murine cells, bovine blood mononuclear cells produced increased levels of IFN-gamma and IL-10, but reduced levels of IL-12p40 in response to GPIs. On these bovine cells, GPI had the tendency to up-regulate MHC class I, but to down-regulate MHC class II. Altogether, these results suggest that N. caninum GPIs might differentially participate in the responses of antigen presenting cells induced by the whole parasite in mouse models of neosporosis and in the natural cattle host.

AB Nucleotides are one of the most primitive extracellular signalling molecules across all phyla and regulate a multitude of responses. The biological effects of extracellular nucleotides/sides are mediated via the specific purinergic receptors present on the cell surface. In mammalian system, adenine nucleotides are the predominant nucleotides found in the extracellular milieu and mediate a constellation of physiological functions. In the context of host-pathogen interaction, extracellular ATP is recognized as a danger signal and potentiates the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from activated immune cells, on the other hand, its breakdown product adenosine exerts potential anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. Therefore, it is increasingly apparent that the interplay between extracellular ATP/adenosine ratios has a significant role in coordinating the regulation of the immune system in health and diseases. Several pathogens express ectonucleotidases on their surface and exploit the purinergic signalling as one of the mechanisms to modulate the host immune response. Leishmania pathogens are one of the most successful intracellular pathogens which survive within host macrophages and manipulate protective Th1 response into disease promoting Th2 response. In this review, we discuss the regulation of extracellular ATP and adenosine levels, the role of ATP/adenosine counter signalling in regulating the inflammation and immune responses during infection and how Leishmania parasites exploit the purinergic signalling to manipulate host response. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in targeting purinergic signalling and the future prospects.

AB Objective: Omentin-1, an anti-inflammatory protein, is secreted by the visceral adipose tissue. Altered levels of Omentin-1 are associated with obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Although Omentin-1 is implicated in the insulin signaling pathway, the relationship between the genetic variants of Omentin-1 and T2D is not yet explored. The current study evaluates the association of Omentin-1 polymorphisms (rs2274907 A/T and rs1333062 G/T), its transcript and protein levels, and genotype-phenotype correlation with metabolic parameters and T2D susceptibility.
   Methods: Plasma and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were separated from venous blood taken from 250 controls and 250 T2D patients recruited from Gujarat, India. Genomic DNA was isolated from PBMCs and genotyping of Omentin-1 variants was performed by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RNA was isolated from Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) samples of 12 controls and 10 patients, and transcript levels of Omentin-1 were assessed by qPCR. Plasma Omentin-1 levels were estimated by ELISA. Fasting Blood Glucose, Body Mass Index (BMI) and plasma lipid profile were considered for the genotype-phenotype correlation analysis.
   Results: Our study revealed no association of Omentin-1 genetic variants with T2D risk (p > 0.05). However, the AT genotype of Omentin-1 rs2274907 A/T polymorphism was associated with increased BMI (p = 0.0247). Plasma Omentin-1 levels were significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) however, increased VAT Omentin-1 transcript levels (p = 0.0127) were observed in T2D patients.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that decreased circulatory Omentin-1 levels could pose a risk towards T2D susceptibility.

AB Almost a third of Irish children are now overweight and the country ranks 58th out of 200 countries for its proportion of overweight youths. With the rising obesity epidemic, and the impaired immune responses of this population, it is vital to understand the effects that obesity has on the immune system and to design future therapeutics, adjuvants and vaccines with overweight and obese populations in mind. Many current vaccines use adjuvants that have been found to be less effective at stimulating the immune response in children compared with adults and there is now substantial effort to design paediatric-focused adjuvants. Additionally, vaccine responses have been shown to be less effective in obese populations indicating that this is a particularly vulnerable population. We have recently identified cytosolic nucleic acids (CNAs), as novel candidate adjuvants for childhood vaccines. Here we investigated whether immune responses to these candidate adjuvants were adversely affected in infants born to overweight or obese mothers, and in overweight and obese children. Type I Interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha) are vital for driving innate and adaptive immune responses. We found that childhood obesity conferred no significant adverse effect on CNA-induced Type I IFN responses when compared with lean children. Similarly, Type I IFN responses were intact in the cord blood of babies delivered from overweight and obese mothers, when compared with lean mothers. There was also no significant impact of obesity on CNA-induced TNF alpha responses in children or from cord blood of infants born to overweight/obese mothers. In all cases, there was a tendency towards decreased production of innate cytokine Type I Interferon and TNF alpha, however there was no significant negative correlation. Interestingly, high maternal BMI showed weak and moderate positive correlation with IL-12p70 and IFN gamma, respectively, in response to CNA stimulation. This study demonstrates that future adjuvants can be tailored for these populations through the use of activators of CNA sensors.

AB Immune cells infiltrating the psoriatic skin secrete high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17, TNF-alpha, IL-21 and IL-36 resulting in chronic inflammation. However, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been fully understood. We report here elevation of IL-33 expression in psoriatic lesions. Studies in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mice with psoriatic inflammation confirmed a critical role for IL-33 in driving the disease. IL-33 reduces the CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, inhibits autophagy in IMQ-treated mouse skin, and promoted tyrosyl phosphorylation of STAT3. Thus, IL-33 appears to be a major risk factor for severity of psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Our findings may open new perspectives for understanding the mechanisms and developing a therapeutic strategy for psoriasis.

AB Resistin is a cysteine-rich cytokine, which has been indicated as a mediator of insulin resistance and inflammation. Previous studies demonstrated that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was an important enzyme that could mediate lipid accumulation in macrophages. Additionally, the intracellular molecules phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine protein kinase (AKT)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR gamma) were supposed to be involved in the lipid accumulation process in cells. However, it remains unclear whether resistin was correlated with the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in macrophages. The present study investigated that resistin could up-regulate the expression of LPL and increase the contents of intracellular triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, intracellular molecules PI3K, AKT and PPAR gamma were significantly up-regulated and activated in resitin-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages (P < 0.05). In contrast, the effects of resistin on RAW264.7 macrophages could be abrogated by specific inhibitors for LPL (LPL-siRNA) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (LY294002). All together, this study demonstrated that resistin could up-regulate the expression of LPL and induce lipid accumulation in RAW264.7 macrophages. More importantly, the PPARy-dependent PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was relevant to the lipid accumulation process in resistin-stimulated macrophages.

AB The maturation state of dendritic cell (DC) plays an important role in immune activities. Previously we had found that NF-kappa B (p65) pathway could promote DC maturation and subsequent immune effects. But the upstream mechanism of this pathway was still unclear. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activating its receptor P2X7R has recently been considered as the fourth signal to activate T lymphocytes. Here we aimed to find out the connection between P2X7R and NF-kappa B (p65) pathway in DC maturation. Results showed that the expression of P2X7R and the intracellular ATP levels were increased along with the maturation of DC. P2X7R agonist stimulated the morphological changes of DCs into the appearance of mature DCs, and promoted the expression of NF-kappa B (p65), as well as the release of IFN-gamma and IL-12. Whereas, P2X7R inhibitor had the opposite influences. Co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the binding of P2X7R and NF-kappa B (p65). Our study suggested that extracellular ATP could promote DC maturation and release of inflammatory cytokines through the binding of P2X7R and NF-kappa B (p65). This is the first study to show the P2X7R-NF-kappa B (p65) pathway in DC. Interference with this pathway may be able to regulate immune responses in areas like infectious diseases, inflammation, transplantation, tumor and autoimmune diseases. In addition, intracellular ATP level could be a new indicator of the maturation state of DC.

AB To clarify cytokines involved in the development of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (s-JIA) associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and to identify the serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of s-JIA associated MAS, we employed an antibody array that simultaneously detects 174 cytokines. Fifteen s-JIA patients including 5 patients receiving tocilizumab (TCZ) were analyzed. The levels of five cytokines were significantly elevated in MAS phase compared to those in the active phase of s-JIA. CXCL9 showed the most significant increase following the development of s-JIA associated MAS. Next, to confirm clinical significance of serum CXCL9 levels as a biomarker for s-JIA associated MAS, serum CXCL9 levels in 56 patients with s-JIA including 20 with MAS were analyzed. Results were compared with the clinical features of s-JIA associated MAS. Serum CXCL9 levels correlated positively with disease activity. Monitoring of serum CXCL9 is useful for the evaluation of disease activity in s-JIA associated MAS.

AB Introduction: Human pregnancy is a state of elevated maternal systemic inflammation, and pregnancy complications are often associated with a dysfunctional immune response. The network of cytokines reflects this complex immune activity, and broad serum cytokine profiling provides a new tool to understand the changes in immune status during pregnancy.
   Objective: This study aimed to determine how maternal serum cytokine patterns change during the first half of pregnancy.
   Methods: Maternal peripheral serum samples collected at a mean gestation of 10, 13, 18 and 24 weeks were included from a prospective clinical study of healthy women (n = 110) in first half of normal pregnancy. The serum samples were analysed for 27 different cytokines using multiplex magnetic bead-based immunoassays, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) was analysed by ELISA. Serum cytokine and CRP patterns were explored with linear mixed effects models (LMM) and multilevel partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).
   Results: Serum cytokine profiling provided partial overview of the maternal immune status and corresponding reference values for serum cytokine levels during the first half of pregnancy. Several cytokines decreased in concentration from first to second trimester. Cytokine pattern analysis revealed that chemokines provided the most sensitive measurement of variation with gestational age in normal pregnancies. The nine inflammatory cytokines showed the highest intra-group correlation during pregnancy, while CRP levels did not correlate with changes in the inflammatory cytokines.
   Conclusion: Chemokines showed the greatest gestational variation and inflammatory cytokines showed a strong infra-group correlation during the first half of pregnancy.

AB Aims: Studies on the prognostic significance of circulating pentraxin-3 level in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have yielded conflicting results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the prognostic value of circulating pentraxin-3 level in CAD patients.
   Materials/methods: We made a systematic literature search in Pubmed, Embae, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP database from their inception to January 10, 2019 for prospective cohort studies that investigated the association between pentraxin-3 level and adverse outcomes in patients with CAD. The outcome measures were all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure or coronary revascularization). Multivariable-adjusted risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was pooled for the highest versus the lowest pentraxin-3 group to summarize the predictive value.
   Results: Nine studies were included, enrolling 5,174 CAD patients. Overall, CAD patients with the highest pentraxin-3 level had an increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.81; 95% CI 1.43-2.28), cardiac death (RR 1.77; 95% CI 1.38-2.26), and cardiac events (RR 1.61; 95% CI 1.16-2.25). However, elevated pentraxin-3 level appeared to not significantly increase the risk of cardiac events (RR 1.63; 95% CI 0.71-3.72) in stable CAD subgroup.
   Conclusions: In CAD patients, elevated circulating pentraxin-3 level is possibly an independent predictor of all cause mortality, cardiac death, and cardiac events. However, interpretation of these findings should be with caution due to the small number of studies analyzed.

AB The complex neuroimmunological interactions mediated by chemokines are suggested to be responsible for the development of neuropathic pain. The lack of knowledge regarding the detailed pathomechanism of neuropathy is one reason for the lack of optimally efficient therapies. Recently, several lines of evidence indicated that expression of CCR2 is increased in spinal cord neurons and microglial cells after peripheral nerve injury. It was previously shown that administration of CCR2 antagonists induces analgesic effects; however, the role of CCR2 ligands in neuropathic pain still needs to be explained. Thus, the goal of our studies was to investigate the roles of CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12 in neuropathic pain development and opioid effectiveness. The experiments were conducted on primary glial cell cultures and two groups of mice: naive and neuropathic. We used chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve as a neuropathic pain model. Mice intrathecally received chemokines (CCL2, CCL7, CCL12) at a dose of 10, 100 or 500 ng, neutralizing antibodies (anti-CCL2, anti-CCL7) at a dose of 1, 4 or 8 mu g, and opioids (morphine, buprenorphine) at a dose of 1 mu g. The pain-related behaviors were assessed using the von Frey and cold plate tests. The biochemical analysis of mRNA expression of glial markers, CCL2, CCL7 and CCL12 was performed using quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR. We demonstrated that CCI of the sciatic nerve elevated spinal expression of CCL2, CCL7 and CCL12 in mice, in parallel with microglia and astroglial activation markers. Moreover, intrathecal injection of CCL2 and CCL7 induced pain related behavior in naive mice in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, intrathecal injection of CCL12 did not influence nociceptive transmission in naive or neuropathic mice. Additionally, we showed for the first time that intrathecal injection of CCL2 and CCL7 neutralizing antibodies not only attenuated CCI-induced pain-related behaviors in mice but also augmented the analgesia induced by morphine and buprenorphine. In vitro studies suggest that both microglia and astrocytes are an important cellular sources of the examined chemokines. Our results revealed the crucial roles of CCL2 and CCL7, but not CCL12, in neuropathic pain development and indicated that pharmacological modulation of these factors may serve as a potential therapeutic target for new (co)analgesics.

AB The present paper deals with the photophysical and time resolved spectroscopic investigations performed on the pristine short chain dyad, (E)-4-(((9H-fluorene-2-yl) imino) methyl)-N,Ndimethylaniline (NNDMBF) and its nanocomposite forms with CQD or NCQD. The experimental results with dyad-CQD (or NCQD) demonstrate that more than 80% trans structure of the ground state dyad could be protected in the environment of CQD (or NCQD) even on photoexcitation. Formations of elongated trans-conformers show in favor of efficient energy-storage systems. The stability of extended conformation has been hinted to be due to combination of surface coverage and surface trap effects, the later process seems to be the dominating one.

AB Sodium silicate (Na2SiO3), a precursor with a low industrial material cost was successfully used to prepare silica aerogels via a sol-gel process and was coated onto a macroporous Al2O3 membrane. After hydrophobic modification, the sodium silicate-derived silica aerogel membranes were used for CO2 absorption in membrane contactors. The experimental results demonstrated that the sodium silicate-derived hydrophobic silica aerogel membranes exhibited a high CO2 absorption flux of 1.5 mmol/m(2)s and could be used continuously for at least 4 days. Sodium silicate-derived hydrophobic silica aerogel membranes show great potential for large-scale CO2 absorption in industrial power plants due to their low-cost and high CO2 absorption flux properties.

AB The metabolic cofactor and energy carrier NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced) has fluorescence yield and lifetime that depends strongly on conformation, a fact that has enabled metabolic monitoring of cells via FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy). Using femtosecond fluorescence upconversion, we show that this molecule in solution participates in ultrafast self-quenching along with both bulk solvent relaxation and spectral relaxation on 1.4 and 26 ps timescales. This, in effect, means up to a third of NADH is effectively "dark" for FLIM in the 400-500 nm observation window commonly employed. Methods to compensate for, avoid or measure dark species corrections are outlined.

AB The effect of aluminum on (La0.7Ba0.3MnO3)(1-x)/(Al2O3)(x) composites is investigated based on their crystal structure, thermoelectric power and magnetic properties. The X-ray diffraction process reveals that the composite still exhibits a rhombohedral perovskite structure (R (3) over barC) of all composites. The thermoelectric power data satisfies the Magnon and Phonon-drag models in the low-temperature range, and the smaller Polaron conduction mechanism in the high-temperature range. The power factor values decrease with Al content and the x = 0.025 record the highest value. All composites undergo ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition at a certain temperature T-C. The AC susceptibility values decrease with the increasing Al content.

Only the species observed by now also show significant calculated populations. A role of solubility in different solvents and/or composition of the arc electrodes could explain variability in the observed populations.

The Nb2O5 surface exhibited photocatalytic oxidation and photo-induced superhydrophilic properties under UV irradiation, and its activity was comparable to those of anatase-type TiO2 surfaces prepared by a sol-gel based method. The surface exhibited excellent underwater superoleophobicity toward n-hexadecane and oleic acid. The underwater oil repellency was superior to that of the TiO2 surface.

AB Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the effects of temperature, strain rate and molecule length on the deformation of graphene/polyethylene composites. At higher temperature, the host molecules move easily to fit the strain during the deformation. When the strain rate is lower, atoms in the composite model are more relaxed to fit the strain, thus the yield stress of the composite model is smaller than that at a higher strain rate. Due to the longer the length of molecules, the relative movement between molecules is more difficult with the increase of the strain, resulting in a larger yield stress.

The feasibility of using microwave radiation to influence the vibration behavior of the electronic excited state or to change the electronic state in the reaction complex region is discussed. We demonstrate microwave radiation can affect the quantum state distribution of the complex. In particular, microwave radiation may effectively change the electronic state. This conclusion has a positive effect on the understanding and use of microwave radiation in chemical reactions.

It was identified and mass selected in a time-of-flight spectrometer. Its infrared spectrum was measured in the region of 2100-4100 cm(-1) by photodissociation of the argon-tagged complex with a tunable infrared OPO/OPA laser system. The observed infrared spectrum was not described well by scaled harmonic theory, but could be assigned by comparison to second order vibrational perturbation theory computations at the B2PLYP/def2-QZVPP level.

AB Hydrogen storage capacity on vanadium (V) decorated porous graphene (PG) has been studied using first-principles calculations. The results show, to avoid a tendency of clustering among V atoms, the maximum number of adsorbed V atoms is two for both sides of the PG unit cell, and four H-2 molecules can be adsorbed around each V atom. Furthermore, at 300 K and without external pressure, ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations results show that six H-2 molecules can be stably adsorbed on both sides of unit cell of PG decorated with V atoms with the gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of 4.58 wt%.

AB The algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) scheme for the polarization propagator provides a series of ab initio methods for the calculation of electronically excited states. Here we examine the accuracy of these methods for calculating excited state geometries and excited state harmonic vibrational frequencies for open-shell singlet excited states. A range of ADC methods have been assessed up to third-order, including both the strict and extended second-order schemes and spinopposite scaling. Third-order ADC is found to provide a high level of agreement for both the experimental excited state geometry and frequency values, while second-order ADC is improved using spin-opposite scaling.

AB Two-dimensional materials attracted extensive attentions in recent years due to their unique properties and various potential applications. In this paper, based on crystal structure prediction, we acquired two stable 2D monolayers of Boron-Carbon-Phosphide compounds, a honeycomb-like and completely flat monolayer BC2P and a semiconductor-metal transition monolayer BC3P3, and discussed structural, electronic and optical properties of the monolayers. Two monolayers are indirect semiconductors having band gaps of 1.4095 (2.0176) eV and 0.4099 (1.004) eV with GGA-PBE (HSE06) which can be tuned under different tensile strains. The wide and tunable band gap of monolayer BC2P makes it exhibit more advantages in terms of high-frequency-response optoelectronic materials. Furthermore, under a-biaxial tensile strain from 6% to 9%, the monolayer BC3P3 can be transformed from a semiconductor to a metal, indicating it has potential applications in strain-engineering nanodevices.

AB The adsorption properties of formaldehyde molecules adsorbed on pristine and doped BN sheet systems were investigated by the first principles method within the density functional theory. The most stable adsorption configurations, adsorption energy, charge transfer, energy band and density of states of pure and doped BN sheets-formaldehyde system were calculated. The results show that the adsorption capacity of BN sheet system doped with S or Al is significantly higher than that of pristine BN sheet. The conductivity of Al, S doped BN-CH2O system is increased due to the tailored energy band gap and/or the introduced impurity levels in the energy band gap by Al, S doping. As a result, Al, S doping accelerates the response of BN sheet to formaldehyde gas and improve the sensitivity of BN sheet as sensor electrode material to formaldehyde gas. The charge transfer between BN sheet and formaldehyde is significantly increased due to the Al, S doping, which leads to the changed carrier concentration and the improved conductivity. The recovery time calculations indicated that formaldehyde molecules desorption from the S doped BN sheet would be unrealistic at room temperature, while the Al doped BN sheet is suitable for formaldehyde molecules detection because of appropriate recovery time at ambient temperature for recycle use. Combination of results of theoretical analysis, we concluded that the Al doped BN sheet may be a good strategy for improving the sensitivity of these sheets toward formaldehyde molecules, while the S doped BN sheet can be as a gas adsorbent for formaldehyde molecules removal from specific environments. The effect of P-doping on BN sheet-formaldehyde system is very slight. Therefore, the present theoretical studies can help us find a suitable way for detection or monitoring the toxic gas formaldehyde molecules by using doped BN sheet.

The predicted molar Gibbs free energies are in excellent agreement with the experimental data in a wide temperature range for three gases under consideration, and the average absolute deviations of the predicted results from the experimental data are 0.06155%, 0.0708% and 0.16696% for the gases Cl-2, Br-2, and HCl, respectively. The proposed model is away from the need of a large amount of experimental spectroscopy data, and only related to the dissociation energy, equilibrium bond length, and equilibrium vibration frequency.

AB Basicity is an important parameter with impact on biological systems and technological problems. The HOMO-LUMO and FERMO theoretical approaches can describe the acid-base behavior of compounds as amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols. In this work, a method was developed using the localization degree Gamma(FERMO) parameter based on projection operators to quantify the localization of molecular orbitals. This new method was employed for the analysis of the protonation reaction of 30 organic compounds. The quantitative data from our findings were able to reproduce experimental data, pointing out that the FERMO approach could better describe the acid-base behavior of the investigated compounds.

AB Steric interference of two bay-hydrogen atoms causes the benzo[c] phenanthrene radical cation to be non-planar. The energy required to remove one of these H atoms (2.8 +/- 0.1 eV, from iPEPICO spectroscopy) is 1.5 eV lower than that required from the planar tetracene ion due to the formation of a new C-C bond. This low dissociation energy precludes benzo[c] phenanthrene ions losing C2H2 (observed from tetracene with an energy of 4.2 eV). The B3-LYP/6-311++G(2d, p) reaction pathways to C2H2 loss are presented and found to be mediated by azulene-containing intermediates. The second IE of tetracene was measured to be 19.0 +/- 0.2 eV.

AB In this work, the possibility of accumulation and storage of electric charge in 400-500 nm thick films formed by proton conductors was shown for the first time by the example of Nafion and graphene oxide. Current-voltage characteristics were studied in the humidity range of 53-80.7%. The process of charge accumulation is regulated by the humidity of the environment. In a dry atmosphere, the charge is preserved even when the potential is applied to the electrodes - the current appears only in a humid atmosphere. Charge accumulation occurs directly in the Nafion or graphene oxide film without chemical transformation, unlike batteries, electrical capacitors and liquid batteries.

ID ELEMENTAL SULFUR; SULFIDE
AB The reduction of SO2 by CO at various sites of CnAun (n=4, 8 and 16) clusters is studied using the dispersion corrected density functional theory. The energy required for the desorption of the final product COS from the respective clusters is lower than the maximum activation energy barrier of the reaction indicating that the clusters considered are free from sulphur poisoning. The rate determining step of the reaction in presence of the above clusters is also determined. The competing pathways which arise due to the presence of other available possible reaction sites are discussed.

AB This study reported the capillary imbibition of ethanol in a cement paste traced by X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) enhanced by CsCl. Results show that CsCl can promote the contrast of X-CT images due to the significant X-ray absorption of Cs. The grey value distributions of horizontal section images were calculated to identify the penetration fronts of the CsCl-ethanol solution in the cement paste. The relationship between imbibition height and time follows the Lucas-Washburn equation. The method of enhancing X-ray sorption by CsCl paves a wide path to in situ monitor liquid imbibition in porous materials for assessing their microstructures and properties.

AB Annually, shipworms and other biofouling species cause millions of dollars in damage to wooden marine infrastructure across the world. Given their abundant larval supply and high dispersal potential, bioeroders and biofoulers are ubiquitous threats that shorten the lifespan of wooden docks, piers, boats and shoreline stabilization structures in coastal environments. Despite these impacts, there are no treatments that completely protect wood against shipworms and biofouling. To explore potential approaches for extending the lifespan of wooden shoreline stabilization structures, we conducted two field experiments to evaluate the resistance to shipworms and biofouling of small and large diameter branches of four trees - laurel oak (Quercus hemisphaerica), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia spp.), and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) - positioned at varying distances from the sediment surface in southeastern US estuaries. We discovered that the wood volume lost to shipworm burrows was concentrated near the sediment surface, more prevalent in tree species with lower wood densities, and varied markedly between years. Barnacle fouling was far higher on branches > 30 cm from the surface and on laurel oak and sweetgum branches. In a third field experiment, we tested two chemical and two non-chemical wood treatments and found chemical treatments to be more effective at deterring barnacle fouling and shipworm burrowing of wooden posts, especially beneath the sediment surface. By identifying desirable characteristics of the wood employed and elevations at which the impacts of shipworms and biofouling are especially prevalent, this experimental study informs the design of more durable wooden stabilization structures in coastal environments.

AB Zeolitites, rocks with a content of zeolite group minerals greater than 50%, can serve as support for plant nutrients uptake, by enabling the slow release of macro- and micronutrients over time. Zeolitites equally improve soil cation exchange and water holding capacity. We analyzed the effect of zeolitite addition to the soil in forest restoration. We hypothesized that zeolitite ameliorated soil quality and consequently improved sward restoration and seedling establishment.
   Soil treatments were applied in 2014 and consist of: ploughed and ripped soil (non-amended) and ploughed, ripped and amended with zeolitite soil (amended).
   After application of the soil treatments, a herbaceous mixture was hand sown. Oak (Quercus robur L.), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) and elm (Ulmus minor Mill.) seedlings were planted twice in the area, in autumn 2014 and autumn 2015. We monitored soil, sward and seedlings from 2015 to 2017. Seedling survival, which was generally above 50%, was never affected by zeolitite addition. The effect on seedling growth was significant only for hawthorn planted in 2015 that was approximately 5 cm taller in the amended soil. Herbaceous vegetation was also slightly affected by zeolitite addition. The zeolitite increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) Olsen in 2015, and exchangeable potassium (K) during the whole study period. Other parameters, such as year and growing season had significant effects on soil, sward and seedling dynamics. Time since restoration, plant-plant interactions, mechanical site preparation and meteorological conditions all together influenced the restoration dynamics more than zeolitite application.

AB With the objective of identifying an ecologically sustainable substrate for commercial gerbera production, we conducted an experiment to assess the effects of super absorbent polymer and organic vermi-products on the physico-chemical properties of the growing media, and plant growth and flower yield in gerbera cv. Yosemite. CPV (Cocopeat: Perlite: Vermiculite) and soil amended with vermicompost (VC, 20%), Pusa hydrogel (PHG, 0.25%) and horn bio-manure (HBM, 1%) had significant positive effects on growth and flowering of gerbera. The lowest (0.29 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3)) bulk density was recorded in CPV + PHG + HBM while the maximum (59.75 +/- 0.63%) water holding capacity was observed in CPV + PHG + VC substrate. The maximum electric conductivity (0.99 +/- 0.06 dS m(-1)) and pH (7.90 +/- 0.04) were recorded in Soil + PHG + VC. Plants grown on CPV + PHG + VC media and sprayed with 20% of vermiwash produced the highest number of leaves during the entire period (31 +/- 0.58), maximum leaf length (30.18 +/- 0.18 cm) and width (8.30 +/- 0.16 cm), maximum number of primary roots (42 +/- 1.53), highest flowers per plant (19.67 +/- 0.33), stalk length (41.08 +/- 0.10 cm) and flower head diameter (10.11 +/- 0.03 cm). Flowers produced on this medium also had an extended attractive appearance (20.33 +/- 0.33 days) and longer vase life (14.33 +/- 0.33 days). Water requirement of gerbera (litre/crop season) on CPV + PHG + VC medium, with or without Vermiwash spray was also considerably lower than other treatments. Overall results suggest that CPV amended with PHG and VC coupled with Vermiwash spray provide congenial conditions for gerbera plant growth and flower production while also simultaneously reducing irrigation water use considerably.

AB Red gypsum is the product of the neutralization of titanium dioxide (TiO2) extraction residue from ilmenite and anatase. The disposal of red gypsum creates heterogeneous plots with layers that may include Fe, Ca, Al, Mg, Mn, S, and other elements and an alkaline pH that makes revegetation complicated and slow. The vertical and horizontal dispersion of the sediment particles are the main concern. Therefore, the establishment of precise vegetation cover is needed to address this issue. One of the aims of this study was (1) to explore the distribution of the spontaneous vegetation found along a red gypsum-formed landfill located at the Ochsenfeld site in eastern France. Additionally, (2) some pedological parameters were also studied to determine the most significant red gypsum chemical drivers influencing the occurrence and abundance of the vegetation within the site. The Braun-Blanquet scale was used to rate the species presence in the field contained in the spontaneous vegetation dataset. The vegetation survey revealed the presence of 59 species from 23 families. The most abundant species was Betula pendula, and a further cluster analysis enabled the differentiation of areas with this species. The CaCl2 extractable concentrations of the nutrients and trace elements, as well as the pH and the organic matter (OM) present in the sampled substrate, were used to form the pedological parameters dataset. A multiple factor analysis (MFA) was performed to link the large datasets together and revealed 3 groups of plants. Group 1 was composed of pH-tolerant species such as B. pendula and S. caprea. Group 2 was formed by Cr-Zn-tolerant species, including Echium vulgare and R. pseudoacacia. Finally, group 3 was characterized by species such as Clematis vitalba and Artemisia vulgaris that tolerate the presence of Na. The MFA revealed a correlation between the Betula pendula distribution and the pH, CaCl2 extractable P concentration and organic matter. On the other hand, A lack of relation of the CaCl2 extractable concentrations of Fe, Mn, Na, Si and K were also found. This study aided in the selection of an adapted candidate for the implementation of the revegetation strategy of a red gypsum landfill in eastern France. Further tests were performed at the site using white birch for Mn accumulation and topsoil stabilization in situ.

AB Many riverine fish species disperse downstream as eggs, juveniles, or adults, which can expose them to injury and death at hydraulic structures. Low-head weirs are one example of a structure that can kill fish, and this impact has been shown to be substantially higher for undershot weirs when compared to overshot weirs. In this study, autonomous sensor devices were released at an overshot and undershot weir under similar discharges to assess what stressors maybe contributing to differences in the survival rates of fish. Although the undershot weir was more likely to expose fish to rapid decompression, the intensity of decompression was mild and it is more likely that higher levels of fluid shear at the undershot are more damaging to early life stage and small-bodied fish. Both weirs showed potential for strike, but this could be managed through improvements in design.

AB As a key part of Chinese environmental policy, wetland restoration has been done for more than 10 years in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeastern China. Wetlands in this region revegetate by natural recolonization after rewetting. Understanding how restored wetland communities deviate from natural conditions can provide important insights into the mechanisms of recovery and improve restoration practice. The floristic composition of the vegetation of four restored wetlands were compared to the adjacent natural sedge meadows in the Sanjiang Plain. We found that Carex species, common dominants of natural sedge meadows, seldom naturally recolonized drained wetlands following hydrologic restoration. Other productive perennials, including Phragmites australis, Calamagrostis angustifolia and Typha angustifolia had dominated and expanded significantly on the restored wetlands. The mean aboveground biomass in the restored wetlands was much higher than the natural wetlands, while the mean species richness in the natural wetlands was much higher than the restored wetlands. Our results suggest that it may be relatively easy to restore high productivity in restored wetlands because of the dominance by productive species. However, Management, such as active revegetation of sedge meadow, particularly tussock-forming Carex, should be an important component of restoration practice to ensure that the restored wetlands support the region's biodiversity in the Sanjiang Plain.

AB Based on the complex population structure of fish species in Songhua River, this paper broke through the present method modeling by the single target species and introduced a developed approach classified by different spawning habits to evaluate ecological flow. Three main spawning periods and two spawning types were respectively analyzed combining with biographical information. For the characteristic of abundant branching channel and wide floodplain in study area, MIKE21 hydrodynamic model was applied to simulate hydrological condition. Combing the habitat preference curves and hydrodynamic results, the composite suitability index for the study reach was attained. At the same time, the lasting time of fish incubation was used to suggest the flow duration. At last, this paper put forward the optimal discharge, flow duration, occurrence time and frequency in April, May and June-July respectively. Using this result, the ecological flow process can effectively support to the management strategies for rational allocation of water resources.

AB Revetments between the river channels and riparian zones are important factors in the modification of urban riparian zones structure, particularly in zones adjacent to them. Although there have been many studies on the stability of revetments in tidal urban riparian zones, the quantitative effects of revetments on the nitrogen cycling in riparian zones adjacent to them remain unclear. Tidal riparian zones undergo more frequent river-soil exchanges than normal riparian areas, thus, revetments may have a greater impact on the nitrogen cycling. Nitrification and denitrification are two important biotransformation processes of nitrogen cycling. In this study, we used soil (depths of 0-20, 25-45, and 55-75 cm) nitrification and denitrification rates as indicators to study the effects of revetment type on the spatial distribution of soil nitrogen cycling in tidal urban riparian zones adjacent to three revetments (permeable concrete pile revetments (PR), impervious masonry stone revetments (IR), and no revetments (NR)) at three distances (0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 m). Our results indicated that compared with natural riparian zones (NR), PR significantly improved soil nitrification and denitrification rates, while IR significantly improved soil nitrification rates but decreased denitrification rates (P < 0.05), which were totally different from the general perception, particularly in impervious revetments. Revetment type mainly affected the temporary inundation zones (0-20 cm). For example, in the temporary inundation zones, the variation in soil denitrification rates was 14.49 mg kg(-1) h(-1), while in the frequent inundation zones (25-45 cm) and the permanent inundation zones (55-75 cm), the variations were 3.26 and 2.94 mg kg(-1) h(-1), respectively. Soil compaction was probably the main constraint factor for soil nitrification in natural riparian zones, soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen availability were probably the main constraint factors for soil denitrification adjacent to impervious revetments. In order to take full advantage of the structural characteristics of impervious revetments and permeable revetments, the combination of impervious revetments in permanent inundation zones and permeable revetments in temporary inundation zones could be optimally designed to enhance soil nitrogen cycling function of tidal urban riparian zones during revetment construction.

AB Floodplains were extensively altered by anthropogenic activities, resulting in modified flow dynamics essential for maintaining diverse riverine communities. There is growing interest in restoring environmental flows by artificially modulating discharge as a potential management option in regulated rivers. In the context of a large floodplain restoration project along the upper Danube, the effects of different magnitudes of discharge on fish, macroinvertebrates and macrophytes in different habitat types of the floodplain system were studied. Community composition of fishes and macroinvertebrates changed after peak-flows of up to a 20-fold increase of mean discharge, whereas species richness and coverage of macrophytes were hardly affected. Over all habitat types, similar community response patterns were evident for macroinvertebrates, whereas in fishes, the most pronounced changes occurred in floodplain ponds that only become connected to the main channel at high flows. Community changes for fish and macroinvertebrates were mostly attributed to higher numbers of individuals (3-fold increase for fishes) rather than to changes of species richness (maximum fish species richness change < 10%), however, rheophilic specialists such as Barbus barbus were much more abundant after e-flows. These findings suggest that environmental flows can have meaningful and desired conservation effects on the aquatic community composition of fishes and macroinvertebrates, depending on the magnitude of the flow and on the specific habitat type. They also stress the importance of managing dynamic flow regimes that must comprise both minimum low flows as well as flood extremes to sustain freshwater biodiversity of high conservation value.

AB One of the major challenges for coral reef science is to find sound management tools to reverse the rapid degradation of the world's reefs and their valuable ecosystem services. In this sense, much effort is dedicated to identify reef resilience indicators and traits, the restoration and protection of which can promote coral reef recovery following degradation. Here we examine two widely studied reef resilience traits, i.e. coral recruitment and structural complexity, and potential links between the two on different spatial scales that may be used to promote reef resilience by active restoration. Specifically, we explore the use of structural complexity enhancement (SCE; artificially increasing the complexity of a degraded reef by adding structures to it) as a potential restoration tool for increasing coral recruitment. Our SCE experiments resulted in an increase of 400-600% in coral recruitment, which was correlated with some of the spatial scales of complexity. From a management perspective, the current study supports the idea that, under certain circumstances, SCE may serve as an effective restoration tool to enhance coral recruitment, which could be an alternative or addition to coral transplantation. The results also emphasize the importance of measuring and enhancing structural complexity on different spatial scales (from mm to m) for the promotion of different functional groups (e.g. corals and fish). This approach, if further developed, may serve as a key element in restoration projects of structurally degraded coral reefs.

AB The objective of this research was to determine the effects of diel cycle and flow velocity on rheotaxis, measure the swimming performance of Perch-barbel (Percocypris pingi, Tchang, 1930) and use the results to recommend an appropriate fishway entrance velocity and fish lift operating schedule. PIT tagging was used to monitor fish rheotaxis for 48 h in four channels with differing flow characteristics. Swimming performance tests were conducted in a swimming respirometer and induced flow speed, critical swimming speed and critical burst speed were determined. The relationship between flow velocity and fish swimming behavior was analyzed to determine the optimal attraction flow velocity. There were three primary findings. (1) Test fish were active both day and night, but made more attempts, had longer retention times, and swam longer through-water distances in all channels during the day. (2) Entry, retention, and effort were maximum at a flow velocity of 0.2 m/s (26% of absolute critical swimming speed (m/s) and 29% of relative critical swimming speed (bl/s)). (3) Attempt number, retention time and through-water distance increased with body length in the channel with greatest activity. Collectively, these data suggest that passage of P. pingi will be optimized by fishways operating throughout the day and most of the night, although these conditions could lead to size-based selectivity in passage.

AB Vegetation restoration has long been considered as an effective strategy for soil conservation in many hilly regions, which can lead to a significant increase in vegetation coverage. The aim of this paper was to quantify the effect of changes in vegetation coverage on soil erosion control in the red soil hilly region of China. Based on a literature review, a database was collected from 35 typical small watersheds. The database covered extensive geographical locations, including 6 provinces and 1 autonomous region of China, with vegetation coverage ranging from 8% to 96%, and the soil erosion modulus ranging from 67 to 13,000 t.km(-2).a(-1). The results confirmed that vegetation coverage significantly and positively affected soil loss. It also indicated that there is a threshold phenomenon between vegetation coverage and soil loss. The vegetation coverage in the small watersheds could be divided into three threshold zones: the lower threshold (0-40%), the transition zone (40-80%), and the upper threshold (80-100%). In these zones, the vegetation soil conservation efficiency and its changing rates were unlike. Thus, different vegetation restoration strategies should be adopted in these zones. In the lower threshold, it is suitable to adopt artificial restoration; in the upper threshold, natural recovery is more reasonable; and in the transition zone, combination of artificial and natural restoration is preferable. This study revealed the vegetation coverage threshold values and the corresponding restoration strategies with respect to soil erosion control at the region scale, which serve as a scientific basis for decision makers.

AB Coral reef restoration requires efficient, effective and scalable techniques and methodologies to counteract the continued decline of coral reefs. Here we tested an in situ method to collect and settle fully developed planulae shed by the brooding coral species (Stylophora pistillata). Three devices called Coral Settlement Boxes (CSB; L x W x H: 50 x 40 x 6 cm; V: 4.5 L) were built from transparent Plexiglas and designed to be easily assembled and disassembled. Each CSB contained two integrated biofilm-covered nets (0.5 x 0.5 cm mesh size), which functioned as settlement substrate. The trap container of a traditional planulae trap was replaced by the CSB, and this new construction was used to collected planulae over 4 consecutive days. The CSBs were then transported to a mid-water coral nursery at 12 m depth. One CSB was disassembled immediately, the two settlement substrates were removed and each was placed in a protective cage (mesh size 4 cm(2)). The other two CSBs were opened after a 4-month period, leaving the four settlement substrates attached to the Plexiglas plates and covered by protective cages. None of the settlement substrates were cleaned of fouling organisms in the nursery. After 5 months in the mid-water nursery, a total of 120 healthy juvenile coral colonies had resulted from the estimated 2045 planulae initially trapped. This inexpensive and simple approach to producing sexually propagated stocks of colonies entirely in situ may enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and scalability of restoration activities that include brooding coral species.

AB Vetiver grass, Chrysopogon zizaniodes (L.) Roberty, is a perennial C4 grass, valued for its aromatic essential oil in the roots. Vetiver attracted global attention as a natural means for diverse environmental applications including detoxification of degraded soil and water. A pilot study was conducted to investigate its potential to rehabilitate iron ore spoil dumpsites generated from the Joda East Iron mine located in Odisha, India. Four diverse genotypes of vetiver: S2 (diploid variety), S4 (tetraploid derivative of S2), TH (originated from Thailand), BL (a broad leaf) were grown over a period of 12 months to observe their growth performance, metal tolerance and metal uptake. The shoot/root length, photosynthetic pigments - chlorophyll, carotenoid and biomass production of plants grown on iron mine soil decreased initially as compared to the control plants grown on garden soil. At the end of 12 month the plants showed evidence of normal growth and appeared healthy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Perl's Prussian blue stain confirmed the uptake and localization of Fe in the roots and shoots of the plants grown on mine soil. In addition Zn, Mn, Cr and Cu, was detected in the plant tissues. Such accumulation of metals in plant tissues led to oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a consequence the activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were increased. Based on the results it can be inferred that vetiver grass per se can tolerate high concentrations of Fe along with other heavy metals in its tissues. Such potential vary across the four genotypes, and the genotype BL followed by S4 can be claimed of paramount importance in terms of phytoremediation. Thus vetiver grass can be effectively used for rehabilitation and soil stabilization of sites contaminated with high levels of heavy metals, particularly Fe, Mn, Zn and Cr.

AB Kick is a simple computational method that enables stochastic searches for stable structures of systems of up to similar to 15 atoms. We propose two new filters to be applied with Kick to enforce minimum bond lengths between all pair of atoms and connectivity of all atoms in candidate structures. As this Restricted Kick method rejects a rapidly increasing number of structures with increasing system size, we furthermore devised the restricted Random Assembly Stochastic Search method, which randomly assembles structures that automatically satisfy these filters. Significant improvements in convergence rate over the original Kick method are obtained for several well-established examples.

In the experiment, a Q-switched and pulsed Nd: YAG laser was used for the ultrasound generation while an optical fiber Fizeau interferometer was designed for detecting ultrasound generated by the laser line source. Our results showed that this system has a high sensitivity as well as a high spatial resolution comparing with other testing equipment.

AB Pure rotational transitions of cis-OSOO are identified in a discharge plasma of a SO2 and O-2 gaseous mixture by Fourier-transform microwave (FTMW) and FTMW-MW double-resonance spectroscopy. Both a- and b-type transitions are observed for this molecule, and the rotational and centrifugal distortion constants are precisely determined from the observed line positions. The inertial defect calculated from the determined rotational constants indicates that the cis-OSOO molecule has a planar equilibrium geometry in the ground vibronic state.

AB In this letter, we developed divide-and-conquer-based self-consistent-field methods with a finite-temperature (FT) scheme, denoted as FT-DC-SCF. The FT scheme can approximately involve the static correlation effect observed in bond-breaking reactions, double bond rotations, diradicals, and conjugated polymers within small additional computational costs. Test calculations of polyene, water cluster, diamond, graphene, magnesium oxide, and titanium demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the developed FT-DC-SCF method. Furthermore, FT-DC-SCF was applied to the singlet-triplet energy gap and double bond rotation.

AB A potential method to select and generate a single-order harmonic has been proposed and investigated via the waveform control of a frequency-chirping two-color field. It is found that with the combination of two-color chirped pulse, a specific 'W' waveform structure can be found on the falling part of the laser field. Consequently, the accelerated electron in this region will obtain the additional energy due to the multi-acceleration-recombination process and a folded structure on the harmonic emission process can be found. Due to this folded structure, a specific single-order harmonic can be selected and enhanced. Moreover, by properly controlling the laser parameters, the enhancement of the frequency-tunazble single-order harmonic can be achieved. The present results will provide the useful information for the attosecond science community.

Nitrogen is doped 9 wt%, and electrochemical active surface area is increased five times, compared to the precursor graphite. Electrochemical impedance is also dramatically reduced from 296 to 34 Omega at 100 Hz. The specific capacitance is finally improved from 27 Fg(-1) to 399 Fg(-1) at 50 mVs(-1), demonstrating high energy density of 40.4 Whkg(-1) when its power density reaches to 617 Wkg(-1). The capacitance retention was 91% after 1000 cycles, revealing high cyclic stability and reliable performance for the supercapacitor applications.

AB The structure and stability of the two-dimensional methane hydrate confined within two graphene sheets are examined with density functional theory. Our calculations suggest that the confined methane hydrate has two distinct patterns, namely, the stable "plum-pudding" structure and the less stable "sandwich" structure. Further, our results indicate that the initial formation process of two-dimensional methane hydrate is that water molecules arrange around the methane molecule to create tetragonal rings that are vertical to the graphene sheet, which will further result in the formation of an intact cage.

AB It is of high importance to develop high-efficient chemosensors for explosive nitroaromatics and explore their sensing mechanisms. In this work, the sensing mechanisms of a series of arylene-vinylene terpyridine conjugated fluorescent probes (P1-P4) for TNP have been investigated in depth. The optical discrepancy of P4 is attributed to the different electron excitation distribution caused by the strong intramolecular twist. The rational combination complex has been proposed and further confirmed with Gibbs free energy profile and H-1 NMR analysis. Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) analysis demonstrates that photo-induced electron transfer (PET) is the fluorescence quenching mechanism for the TNP detection.

It is found that the presence of a B impurity can modify the surface reactivity of C3N and promote the effective adsorption of N2O. The reduction of N2O over B-doped C3N nanosheets starts with the adsorption of this molecule, followed by its decomposition into N-2 and an active oxygen atom (O*). By overcoming a small activation energy, the O* moiety can be then eliminated by a CO molecule. The results suggest that B-doped C3N nanosheets are promising catalysts to remove the environmentally harmful N2O molecules.

AB We have found capsule-formed dimers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (cap-di-PAH) for coronene, ovalene, and circumcoronene by quantum chemical calculations. Two monomers are connected at the edge that gives a capsule form, holding the aromatic characters in the inner six-membered rings. The aromatic pi-electron networks at the upper and lower parts of the dimers are not merged each other. Those cap-di-PAHs are located in sufficiently deep potential wells surrounded by high energy barriers, indicating the high possibility of existence.

AB Copper oxide (CuO)-decorated anatase and TiO2(B) dual-phase titania microsphere (CuO/TiO2(AB)) photocatalysts were synthesized using a facile two-step approach. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to form methyl formate (MF) in methanol was evaluated. The results indicated that the CuO-decorated dual-phase TiO2 microspheres displayed MF yield of 1800 mu mol.g(-1) under 4 h illumination, higher than other reference photocatalysts, due to its mixed-phase heterojunction structure and larger surface area, thus leading to an enhanced UV-light response, effective separation and low recombination rate of the photoinduced charge carriers. CuO/TiO2(AB) also showed good stability with the MF yield reproducibility greater than 90% in cyclic runs.

AB The structural and electronic properties of a heterojunction made of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and g-C2N have been investigated by first-principles calculations involving the weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction described by the Grimme approach. It is found that the h-BN/g-C2N heterojunction is a typical type-II heterojunction with a direct band gap around 0.80 eV. The atomic projected density of states and the band-decomposed charge densities have demonstrated that the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the h-BN/g-C2N heterojunction are mainly provided by h-BN and g-C2N, respectively. Moreover, we find that the changes of band gap are very small for large variations of the vertical interlayer distance between h-BN and g-C2N. Our results indicate the great potential application in Li-ion battery and electronic device due to the large variation of interlayer distance induced by ion insertion or vertical strains for h-BN/g-C2N heterojunction.

Two types of Stockmayer particles, D-(N) and D-(T), with disparate polarities are chosen to reproduce the empirical room temperature properties of six molecules of a highly polar substance, namely nitromethane, and one hundred of a relatively less polar substance, tetrahydrofuran, to study the effects of additives in electrolyte mixtures typically used in lithium batteries. The global minimum features a pentacoordinated charge on the surface, while the ion is found between two solvation layers around room temperature.

The solubility, surface activity and rheology in aqueous solution of mixed C(12)GA and borax were investigated by surface tension measurements, transmission electron microscopy and rheometry. The results show that borax was a good solubilizing agent for C(12)GA. B(OH)(4)(-) acted as a crosslinking agent to form network structure gels based on complexes with an increase in the borax and C(12)GA concentrations. The produced gels were temperature sensitive. The solubilization mechanisms of borax on C(12)GA were also discussed.

Molecular dynamics simulation is used to demonstrate the escaping process of the CO2. The results show that the CO2 can completely escape from the Pt-4 cluster at 373 K and the alone Pt-4 cluster can be used to split H2O molecule again.

AB The reaction of peroxy radicals, RO2, with OH radicals has long been ignored to play any role in atmospheric chemistry. Recent experimental and modeling studies show however that these reactions are fast and can play a role in remote atmospheres with low NO concentrations when the major fate of peroxy radicals, its reaction with NO, slows down. The present article summarizes recent work on this class of reactions and its implications in different environments.

On the basis of molecular structure analysis, spectra comparisons and electron density studies, we confirm that the intermolecular hydrogen bond in PRODAN derivative-toluene complex is strengthened upon the photoexcitation. Frontier molecular orbitals exhibited the similar electron density distributions in HOMO and LUMO, suggesting that the PRODAN derivative 1a experiences the local excitations in toluene.

AB The reaction mechanism of the non-enzymatic stereoselective formation of the (3S, 3aS, 7aR) configuration of the wine lactone from the (6R) form of (E)-8-carboxylinalool in acidic aqueous solution was analyzed by quantum chemistry calculations. The transition states for the cyclization and hydride shift of the carbocation intermediates were obtained (< 55 kJ/mol). As the wine lactone has three chiral centers and eight possible configurations, we compared the reaction barriers which would generate the different configurations. It was revealed that the formation of the (3S, 3aS, 7aR) configuration would be preferred than all the other forms among the present reaction paths.

AB The photoionization of helium ion in bichromatic circularly polarized XUV laser pulses is investigated by solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. It shows that the electron can reach the continuum at the same momentum by absorbing one high-energetic photon or two low-energetic photons sequentially, and these two pathways can interfere with each other. Moreover, the interference can induce the asymmetrical round and the spiral-loop photoelectron momentum distributions in bichromatic circularly laser fields without and with the time delay.

AB Chronic inflammation is recognized as a key tumor-promoting factor in a number of epithelial cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment by both the innate and the adaptive immune response can activate signaling pathways that are associated with increased cell survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Among the cytokines that have most commonly been linked to inflammation-associated cancers, are the Th17 cell-associated cytokines IL-17A, IL-23, IL-22, and the IL-1 family members IL-113 and IL-18. However, whether their contribution to inflammation-associated cancers is universal, or specific to individual types of cancers, remains to be elucidated. This review will explore our current understanding of the known roles of these cytokines in gastritis and discuss how their therapeutic inhibition may be useful for GC.

AB The TGF beta signaling pathway is a critical regulator of cancer progression in part through induction of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). This process is aberrantly activated in cancer cells, facilitating invasion of the basement membrane, survival in the circulatory system, and dissemination to distant organs. The mechanisms through which epithelial cells transition to a mesenchymal state involve coordinated transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of gene expression. One such mechanism of control is through the RNA binding protein hnRNP El, which regulates splicing and translation of a cohort of EMT and stemness-associated transcripts. A growing body of evidence indicates a major role for hnRNP El in the control of epithelial cell plasticity, especially in the context of carcinoma progression. Here, we review the multiple mechanisms through which hnRNP El functions to control EMT and metastatic progression.

AB Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 is the main mediator of IL-6-type cytokine signaling and an important transcriptional regulator of cell proliferation, maturation and survival. It has been described as a key player in cancer development and progression. However, under certain circumstances, STAT3 is also considered a potent tumor suppressor. This heterogeneity partially depends on its expression as different iso-forms. Alternative splicing gives rise to two STAT3 isoforms, STAT3 alpha and its truncated version STAT3 beta. Both isoforms are transcriptionally active and display distinct functions under physiological and pathological conditions. In fact, while STAT3 alpha is widely described as an oncogene, STAT3 beta has gained attention as a potential tumor suppressor. This review provides a concise overview of the current knowledge on STAT3 during tumorigenesis, with special emphasis on the unique and complex roles of its alternatively spliced isoforms.

AB Among myriads of distinct chemical modification in RNAs, the dynamic, reversible and fine-tuned methylation of N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent modification in eukaryotic mRNAs. This RNA mark is generated by proteins that act as m(6)A writers and can be reversed by proteins that act as m(6)A erasers. The RNA m(6)A modification is also mediated by another group of proteins capable of recognizing m(6)A that act as m(6)A readers. The m(6)A modification exerts direct control over the RNA metabolism including mRNA processing, mRNA exporting, translation initiation, mRNA stability and the biogenesis of long-non-coding RNA (LncRNA), thereby can influence various aspects of cell function. Evidently, m(6)A is intimately associated with cancer development and progression such as self-renewal capacity of cancer stem cells, proliferation, apoptosis and therapeutic resistance, and immune response. In this review, we will discuss the regulation and function of m(6)A, the various functions ascribed to these proteins and the emerging concepts that impact our knowledge of these proteins and their roles in the epitranscriptome. Conceivably, m(6)A may play pivotal roles in cytokine and immune response and carcinogenesis.

AB Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, with sustained responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors reported in a number of malignancies. Such therapeutics are now being trialed in aggressive or advanced cancers that are heavily reliant on untargeted therapies, such as triple negative breast cancer. However, responses have been underwhelming to date and are very difficult to predict, leading to an inability to accurately weigh up the benefit-to-risk ratio for their implementation. The tumor immune microenvironment has been closely linked to immunotherapeutic response, with superior responses observed in patients with T cell-inflamed or 'hot' tumors. One class of cytokines, the type I interferons, are a major dictator of tumor immune infiltration and activation. Tumor cell inherent interferon signaling dramatically influences the immune microenvironment and the expression of immune checkpoint proteins, hence regulators and targets of this pathway are candidate biomarkers of immunotherapeutic response. In support of a link between IFN signaling and immunotherapeutic response, the combination of type I interferon inducers with checkpoint immunotherapy has recently been demonstrated critical for a sustained anti-tumor response in aggressive breast cancer models. Here we review evidence that links type I interferons with a hot tumor immune microenvironment, response to checkpoint inhibitors and reduced risk of metastasis that supports their use as biomarkers and therapeutics in oncology.

AB The JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is responsible for mediating signals of over fifty cytokines, growth factors and hormones. Signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway is regulated on multiple levels, including intramolecular regulation by the JAK pseudokinase domain, and intermolecular regulation by a host of regulatory proteins. The advent of accessible genomic tools have provided a wealth of information on disease-associated mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway and its regulatory components. The vast number of these mutations in diseases ranging from immunodeficiencies and obesity to many cancers highlight the importance of correct regulation of JAK-STAT signaling for biological processes such as hematopoiesis, regulation of the immune system, metabolism, and growth. Simultaneously, JAK inhibitors are gaining traction in clinical use, both for treatment of diseases driven by JAK mutations, and for a host of inflammatory disorders, in which proin-flammatory cytokine signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway is an integral part of pathogenesis. The elucidation of molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of complex diseases has also, however, brought the limitations of our current understanding on the regulation of cytokine signaling to the foreground. Indeed, deeper understanding of these regulatory mechanisms are a prerequisite for the development of the next generation of pharmacological modulators of the JAK-STAT pathway. In this review we discuss the current state of knowledge of the infra- and intermolecular regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway, with a focus on diseases arising from disruptions in the regulatory apparatus.

AB Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells with an intrinsic ability to detect and kill infected and cancerous cells. The success of therapies targeting immune checkpoints on CD8 cells has intensified interest in harnessing the cytolytic effector functions of NK cells for new cancer treatments. NK cell development, survival and effector activity is dependent on exposure to the cytokine interleukin (IL)-15. The suppressor of cytokine (SOCS) proteins (CIS; SOCS1-7) are important negative regulators of cytokine signaling, and both CIS and SOCS2 are reported to have roles in regulating NK cell responses. Their immunomodulatory effects on NK cells suggest that these SOCS proteins are promising targets that can potentially form the basis of novel cancer therapies. Here we discuss the role of NK cells in tumor immunity as well as review the role of the SOCS proteins in regulating IL-15 signaling and NK cell function.

AB In cancer, the adenosinergic pathway participates in the generation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and in the promotion of tumor growth through the generation of adenosine (Ado). The present study analyzed the participation of Ado, generated through the functional activity of the cervical cancer (CeCa) pathway in CeCa cells, to induce the expression and secretion of TGF-beta 1, as well as the participation of this factor to maintain CD73 expression. Ado concentrations greater than 10 mu M were necessary to induce an increase of over 50% in the production and expression of TGF-beta 1 in CeCa tumor cells. Blockade of A2AR and A2BR with the specific antagonists, ZM241385 and MRS1754, respectively, strongly reversed the production of TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 1 produced by CeCa cells was necessary to maintain CD73 expression because the addition of anti-TGF-beta neutralizing antibodies or the inhibition of TGF-beta RI strongly reversed the expression of CD73 in the CeCa cells. These results suggested a feedback loop in CeCa cells that favors immunosuppressive activity through the production of TGF-beta 1 and Ado as well as the autocrine activity of TGF-beta 1 and expression of CD73.

AB Many tumor cells escape from cancer immunosurveillance and resist treatment with interferons (IFNs). Although the mechanism underlying IFN resistance is mostly attributed to a deficiency of components of the IFN-signaling pathway, some types of tumor cells resist IFN-mediated cell growth arrest despite the presence of an intact JAK/STAT signaling pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the unresponsiveness to IFNs independent of the defective JAK/STAT pathway remain to be clarified. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying IFN gamma resistance, we examined the anti-proliferative effect of IFN gamma on mouse tumor cell lines. Mouse squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) cells were resistant to IFN gamma-mediated cell growth arrest despite the presence of the IFN gamma-induced STAT1-dependent signaling pathway, whereas IFN gamma inhibited cell growth of B16/F1 cells, a well-known IFN gamma-sensitive mouse melanoma cell line, at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Treatment of SCCVII cells with IFN gamma neither downregulated the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin A2, and cyclin E1 nor induced a hypo-phosphorylated, active form of retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Interestingly, the hyper-phosphorylated, inactive form of pRb was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm in SCCVII cells. The IFN-inducible 204 gene (Ifi204), whose gene product, p204, binds to pRb and exerts an anti-proliferative effect, was repressed in SCCVII cells. p204 overexpression in SCCVII significantly inhibited cell growth, and mutation of a pRb-binding LXCXE motif decreased the anti-proliferative effect. These results suggest that silencing of Ifi204/p204 induces resistance to IFN gamma-mediated cell growth arrest in SCCVII cells.

AB Background: Increasing amount of evidence points to the importance of immunity in breast cancer. The prognostic value of cytokines and their effect on tumorigenesis remains inconsistent.
   Aim: To investigate the prognostic significance of IL6 and IL8 and their association with ER and HER2 in estrogen -dependent (ER +) breast cancer.
   Material and methods: The study included 79 premenopausal women with early and locally advanced ER + breast cancer. All patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy: tamoxifen alone (56/79) or combination with LHRH agonist goserelin (23/79). IL6 and IL8 serum protein levels were measured by ELISA. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was implemented for prognostic evaluation of the data categorized based on metastasis outcome.
   Results: IL6 associated with good (P = 0.001, HR = 0.05) and IL8 with poor disease outcome (P = 0.03, HR = 2.5) in the whole group of patients. Multivariate analyses highlighted IL6 as the independent prognostic factor (P = 0.001, HR = 0.0007). When patients were classified according to ER or HER2 status, IL6 did not have prognostic significance in ERlow and ERhigh subgroups, while IL8 retained prognostic significance only in the ERhigh subgroup (P = 0.04, HR = 2.8). IL6 was significant in both HER2 (P = 0.001, HR = 0.05) and HER2+ subgroups (P = 0.002, HR = 0.04), while IL8 retained its prognostic significance only in the HER2+ subgroup (P = 0.001, HR = 77.8).
   Conclusions: This study contributes to the clarification of the prognostic performance of IL6 and IL8 by providing their first prognostic evaluation in the homogenized ER + breast cancer patient group. IL6 was indicated as a marker of favorable, whereas IL8 was a marker of unfavorable disease outcome.

AB Background and objective: Anti-angiogenic treatment has been recently shown to be clinically beneficial for mesothelioma patients. Angiopoietins-1 and -2 are key regulators of tumor angiogenesis. Ang-1 is mainly known to promote angiogenesis and vessel stability, while Ang-2 could serve as an antagonist of Ang-1 causing vessel regression and destabilization or enhance angiogenesis in a context-dependent manner. We hypothesized that Ang-1 would promote and Ang2 would halt experimental mesothelioma by affecting tumor angiogenesis.
   Methods: To examine the effects of angiopoietins in mesothelioma angiogenesis and in vivo growth we constructed Ang-1 or Ang-2 overexpressing AE17 and AB1 mesothelioma cells and implanted them in the respective syngeneic animals. We also explored the clinical relevance of our observations using the human tumoral mRNAseq data available in the TCGA database.
   Results and conclusions: Ang-1 promotes mesothelioma angiogenesis and growth while the effect of Ang-2 is context-dependent. Low Ang-1 levels in human mesotheliomas are associated with the epitheloid subtype. Tumors of high Ang-1, or concurrent high Ang-2 and VEGF expression present high PECAM-1 and CDH5 expression, markers of vascularity and vascular stability, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of angiopoietins in mesothelioma pathophysiology and pave the way for the clinical development of novel antiangiogenic strategies.

AB Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a fast-growing cancer characterized by high occurrences of nodal and distant metastases and poor prognosis. It is therefore important to identify new serum biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of this disease. The present study identifies biomarkers in NPC patient serum using a solid-phase antibody array detecting the expression profiles of 174 cytokines in a single experiment. ELISA was performed to validate the array results. The levels of TIMP-2, SELL, CCL24, MMP-1, MMP-3, IGF-I and IL-8 were significantly higher in serum from NPC patients, while the levels of MSP-alpha and HCC-4 were lower. Furthermore, the validation results were identical to those obtained from the antibody array. These results indicate that these cytokines might serve as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of NPC.

AB Interleukin (IL)-7 stimulation improves virus- and tumor-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. However, the role of IL-7 in modulation of dysfunctional CD8(+) T cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was not completely understood. In this study, a total of 37 HLA-A2 restricted patients with HCC and 16 healthy individuals were enrolled. IL-7 expression and its receptor alpha chain CD127 level was measured. The regulatory activity of IL-7 to peripheral and liver-resident CD8(+) T cells was investigated in co-culture systems which were directly or indirectly contacted with HCC cell line HepG2 in vitro. Serum IL-7 concentration was significantly reduced in HCC patients, while effective anti-tumor treatment up-regulated IL-7 expression. However, CD127 expression was comparable on peripheral CD8(+) T cells from either HCC patients and healthy individuals, and was also similar on liver resident CD8(+) T cells from either normal tissues and HCC specimens. CD8(+) T cells purified from normal liver tissues also presented stronger cytotoxicity compared with those from HCC specimens prior to and post IL-7 treatment. Moreover, IL-7 stimulation not only augmented cytotoxicity of peripheral and liver-resident CD8(+) T cells, but also promoted IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production by CD8(+) T cells in direct contact co-culture system. This process was accompanied by down-regulation of programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression on CD8(+) T cells. Our present data indicated that IL-7 enhanced both cytolytic and noncytolytic activity of CD8(+) T cells to HCC probably via repression of PD-1 under direct tumor cells presentation.

AB Interleukin (IL)-33/ST2 pathway plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis through influencing cancer sternness, tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and accumulation of regulatory T cells in tumor microenvironments. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of IL-33 rs7025417 and ST2 rs3821204 with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genotyping of IL-33 rs7025417 and ST2 rs3821204 was carried out using a Taqman assay. IL-33 and ST2 mRNA was examined using real-time PCR and plasma IL-33 and sST2 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The ST2 rs3821204 CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC (CC vs. GG: adjusted OR = 2.29, 95% CI, 1.39-3.78; dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.58, 95% CI, 1.12-2.23; recessive model: adjusted OR = 1.88, 95% CI, L21-2.93; C vs. G: adjusted OR-- 1.53, 95% CI, 1.20-1.95). Gene-environment interaction analysis showed that the risk effect of rs3821204 CG/CC genotypes was more evident in smokers (adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI, 1.13-2.55) and drinkers (adjusted OR = 1.57, 95% CI, 1.04-2.37). The increased risk was also observed in combined analysis. Moreover, HCC patients with ST2 rs3821204 CC genotype had higher levels of mRNA and protein expression (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that ST2 rs3821204 CC genotype may contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis by enhancing ST2 production at the transcriptional and translational level.

TI M2 polarization of macrophages by Oncostatin M in hypoxic tumor

AB Oncostatin M (OSM), an inflammatory cytokine belonging to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) superfamily, plays a vital role in multitude of physiological and pathological processes. Its role in breast tumor progression and metastasis to distant organs is well documented. Recent reports implicate OSM in macrophage M2 polarization, a key pro tumoral phenomenon. M2 polarization of macrophages is believed to promote tumor progression by potentiating metastasis and angiogenesis. In the current study, we delineated the mechanism underlying OSM induced macrophage M2 polarization. The findings revealed that OSM skews macrophages towards an M2 polarized phenotype via mTOR signaling complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC2 relays signals through two effector kinases i.e. PKC-alpha and Akt. Our results indicated that mTORC2 mediated M2 polarization of macrophages is not dependent on PKC-alpha and is primarily affected via Akt, particularly Aktl. In vivo studies conducted on 4T1/BALB/c mouse orthotropic model of breast cancer further corroborated these observations wherein i.v. reintroduction of mTORC2 abrogated monocytes into orthotropic mouse model resulted in diminished acquisition of M2 specific attributes by tumor associated macrophages. Metastasis to distant organs like lung, liver and bone was reduced as evident by decrease in formation of focal metastatic lesions in mTORC2 abrogated monocytes mice. Our study pinpoints key role of mTORC2-Aktl axis in OSM induced macrophage polarization and suggests for possible usage of Oncostatin-M blockade and/or selective mTORC2 inhibition as a potential anti-cancer strategy particularly with reference to metastasis of breast cancer to distant organs such as lung, liver and bone.

AB We attempted a preclinical study using DMH-induced CRC rat model to evaluate the antitumor potential of our recently synthesized 1,3,4-thiadiazoles. The molecular insights were confirmed through ELISA, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. The CRC condition was produced in response to COX-2 and IL-6 induced activation of JAK2/STAT3 which, in turn, was due to the enhanced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. The treatment with 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives (VR24 and VR27) caused the significant blockade of this signaling pathway. The behavior of STAT3 populations in response to IL-6 and COX-2 stimulations was further confirmed through data-based mathematical modeling using the quantitative western blot data. Finally, VR24 and VR27 restored the perturbed metabolites associated to DMH-induced CRC as evidenced through H-1 NMR based serum metabolomics. The tumor protecting ability of VR24 and VR27 was found comparable or to some degree better than the marketed chemotherapeutics, 5-flurouracil.

AB Background: Chemokines and chemokine receptors are critical in oral tumourigenesis. The atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2 is a scavenger of CC chemokines controlling the availability of these molecules at tumour sites, but the role of ACKR2 in the context of oral carcinogenesis is unexplored.
   Methods: In this study, wild-type (WT) and ACKR2 deficient mice (ACKR2(-/-)) were treated with chemical carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-l-oxide (4NQO) for induction of oral carcinogenesis. Tongues were collected for macro and microscopic analysis and to evaluate the expression of ACKRs, CC chemokines and its receptors, inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic factors, adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix components.
   Results: An increased expression of ACKR2 in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lesions of 4NQO-treated WT mice was observed. No significant differences were seen in the ACKR1, ACKR3 and ACKR4 mRNA expression comparing SCC lesions from WT and ACKR2(-/-) treated mice. Significantly higher expression of CCL2, IL-6 and IL-17 was detected in ACKR2(-/-) treated mice. In contrast, the expression of other CC-chemokines, and receptors, angiogenic factors, adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix components were similarly increased in SCC lesions of both groups. Clinical and histopathological analysis revealed no differences in inflammatory cell recruitment and in the SCC incidence comparing WT and ACKR2(-/-) treated mice.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that ACKR2 expression regulates inflammation in tumour-microenvironment but the absence of ACKR2 does not impact chemically-induced oral carcinogenesis.

AB Objectives: To evaluate safety outcomes from clinical studies of a 12-month contraceptive vaginal system (CVS) releasing an average of segesterone acetate (SA) 150 mcg and ethinyl estradiol (EE) 13 mcg daily.
   Study design: We integrated clinical safety data from nine studies in which women used the CVS for 21 consecutive days and removed it for 7 days of each 28-day cycle. Four studies used the final manufactured CVS, including a 1-year pharmacokinetic study, two 1-year phase 3 trials and a second-year treatment extension study. We assessed safety by evaluating adverse events women reported in a daily diary. We also included data from focused safety studies evaluating endometrial biopsies, vaginal microbiology and liver proteins from one of the phase 3 studies.
   Results: The combined studies included 3052 women; 2308 women [mean age 26.7 +/- 5.1 years; mean body mass index (BMI) 24.1 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)] received the final manufactured CVS, of whom 999 (433%) completed 13 cycles of use. Women using the final CVS most commonly reported adverse events of headache (n=601, 26%), nausea (n=420, 18%), vaginal discharge/vulvovaginal mycotic infection (n=242, 10%) and abdominal pain (n=225, 10%). Few (<1.5%) women discontinued for these complaints. Four (0.2%) women experienced venous thromboembolism (VTE), three of whom had risk factors for thrombosis [Factor V Leiden mutation (n=1); BMI>29 kg/m(2) (n= 2)]. During 21,482 treatment cycles in the phase 3 studies evaluable for expulsion, women reported partial expulsions in 4259 (19.5%) cycles and complete expulsions in 1509 (7%) cycles, most frequently in the initial cycle [499/2050 (243%) and 190/2050 (9.3%), respectively]. Safety-focused studies revealed no safety concerns.
   Conclusion: The 1-year SA/EE CVS has an acceptable safety profile. Additional studies are warranted in obese women at higher risk of VTE.

   a contraceptive vaginal ring releasing Nestorone and estradiol

   METABOLISM; MENOPAUSE
AB Objective: To evaluate changes in the bone turnover markers CTx and P1NP during 6 months' use of novel continuous contraceptive vaginal rings delivering Nestorone (NES) 200 mcg/day and three doses of estradiol (E2) (10, 20, and 40 mcg/day).
   Study design: This randomized trial enrolled 189 women who used two consecutive vaginal rings over 180 days. Frequent blood sampling permitted analysis of NES, E2, CTx and PINP concentrations. The bone-turnover marker analyses included only women with complete sampling and excluded women with characteristics that might interfere with accurate measurement of bone markers such as afternoon sampling, poor ring compliance or recent pregnancy. We evaluated the change from baseline to 6 months in CTx and PINP, stratified by ring dose and by average circulating E2 concentrations.
   Results: One hundred fifty-one women completed the study, and 82 women had complete data available for the bone marker analyses; the three dosage groups were balanced with regard to baseline characteristics. E2 concentrations remained low throughout treatment, regardless of which dose ring the participant used. Individual CTx changes from baseline averaged 27 +/- 56% (p<.01). Similarly, individual P1NP changes averaged 11 +/- 33% (p=.04). These increases were within the premenopausal reference ranges, and unrelated to treatment dose or to circulating E2 concentrations.
   Conclusions: The low E2 dose of these rings was associated with low E2 concentrations and modest increases in serum bone turnover makers. Because we have only 6-month bone turnover markers and no direct evidence of bone loss or bone density change, these results must be interpreted with caution. Implications: Nestorone, a 19-norprogesterone derivative, leads to complete ovarian suppression, which should yield excellent contraceptive effectiveness. To prevent potential adverse effects on bone, the NES contraceptive ring should be combined with higher doses of E2 than were assessed in this study. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Intrauterine mepivacaine instillation for pain relief during
   intrauterine device insertion in nulliparous women: a double-blind,
   randomized, controlled trial
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Intrauterine devices; Contraception; Pain; VAS; Mepivacaine
ID LIDOCAINE INFUSION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM
AB Objective: To evaluate whether intrauterine mepivacaine instillation before intrauterine device (IUD) insertion decreases pain compared to placebo.
   Study design: We performed a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing mepivacaine 1% 10 mL versus 0.9% NaCI intrauterine instillation using a hydrosonography catheter 5 min before IUD insertion in women 18 years of age or older. Participants completed a series of 10-cm visual analogue scales (VAS) to report pain during the procedure. The primary outcome was the difference in VAS scores with IUD insertion between intervention group and placebo. Secondary outcomes included VAS before and after insertion and analgesia method acceptability.
   Results: We randomized 86 women in a 1:1 ratio; both groups had similar baseline characteristics. In the intention to-treat analysis, the primary outcome, median VAS with IUD insertion, was 4.8 cm in the intervention group [n=41, interquartile range (IQR) =3.1-5.8] and 5.9 cm in the placebo group (n=40, IQR=3.3-7.5, p=.062). In the per protocol analysis, the median VAS with IUD insertion was 4.8 cm (IQR=3.1-5.5) and 6.0 cm (IQR=3.4-7.6) for the intervention and placebo groups, respectively (p=.033). More women in the intervention group reported the procedure as easier than expected (n=26, 63.4% vs. n=15, 37.5%), and fewer reported it as worse than expected (n=3, 73% vs. n=14, 35%, p=.006).
   Conclusion: Intrauterine mepivacaine instillation before IUD insertion modestly reduces pain, but the effect size may be clinically significant
   Implications statement: While the reduction in VAS pain scores did not meet our a priori difference of 1.3 points for clinical significance, participants' favorable subjective reaction suggests that this approach merits further study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess the impact of early versus late menstrual cycle insertion on bleeding/spotting in the 90 days following levonorgestrel (LNG) 13.5 mg intrauterine system (IUS) insertion.
   Study design: In this observational study, participants received a LNG 13.5 mg IUS and provided 90 days of bleeding/spotting data by answering the following daily text: "Have you had no flow (0), spotting (1), or bleeding (2) today?" We dichotomized insertion timing as early (days 1-7 from last menstrual period) and late (remainder of menstrual cycle) and compared bleeding/spotting between the two groups in the 90- and 30-day reference periods. We used multivariate regression methods to study associations between cycle day at insertion, parity, historical bleeding, recent hormonal contraceptive use and bleeding/spotting.
   Results: In the 90-day dichotomous analysis (n=125), we found no differences in the number of days of bleeding/ spotting, bleeding or spotting between the early and late insertion groups. In the 30-day dichotomous analysis (n= 131), early insertion was associated with fewer days of bleeding than late insertion (5 +/- 3 vs. 7 +/- 4 days, p<.01). Recent hormonal contraceptive users experienced fewer days of bleeding than new users (5 +/- 4 vs. 7 +/- 3 days, p<.01). In the 90- and 30-day regression models, earlier insertion was associated with fewer days of bleeding (p=.02, p=.02). Recent contraceptive use was associated with fewer days of bleeding/spotting (90-day, p=.03) and fewer days of bleeding (30-day, p<.01). Nulliparity was associated with spotting (30-day, p=.04).
   Conclusions: Early cycle insertion does not impact 90-day bleeding/spotting. Early cycle insertion and recent hormonal contraceptive use decrease 30-day bleeding.
   Implications: The LNG 13.5 mg IUS may be inserted throughout the menstrual cycle with small differences in bleeding patterns in the 30 but not the 90 days following insertion. Shared decision making should determine timing of insertion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID EFFICACY; DATABASES; WOMEN
AB Objective: To compare the risk of all-cause death, hospitalizations (any cause), ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease or infection, uterine perforation, device removal, neuro-psychiatric drugs initiation, or new psychiatric visit(s) between levonorgestrel (LNG) 52 mg intrauterine system (IUS) and copper intrauterine device (IUD) users in France.
   Study design: We identified a historical cohort of women aged 20-55 years with a first dispensing of either LNG 52 mg IUS or copper-IUD between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, in the French National Claims database, SNDS. We used propensity score matching to balance the two groups on baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics to minimize confounding. We estimated Cox proportional hazards models to compare health outcomes between LNG 52 mg IUS and copper-IUDs users.
   Results: We matched 9318 LNG 52 mg IUS users (mean age 36.2 +/- 6.8 years) to 10,185 copper-IUD users (mean age 35.4 +/- 7.1 years). After matching and age-adjustment, LNG 52 mg IUS users had a slightly higher risk of anxiolytic drugs initiation (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01-1.15) and device removal (HR 1.05, 95%Cl 1.01-1.10) compared to copper-IUD users, with no differences for other studied outcomes.
   Conclusion: French IUS users report slightly more anxiolytic treatment initiation and IUD removal compared to copper-IUD users. These results are consistent with a potential pharmacovigilance signal of anxiety-related disorders in LNG 52 mg IUS users.
   Implications statement: In French LNG 52 mg IUS users, there was slightly more anxiolytic treatment initiation and IUD removal compared to copper-IUD users. No risk difference was found for all-cause death, hospitalizations, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic disorders, and uterine perforation. We cannot exclude that the associations are related to differences in characteristics of women who chose each type of type of IUD. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The bioavailability of the non-hormonal male contraceptive adjudin is low in rats due to the blood testis barrier (BTB). This study was designed to examine if F5-peptide, an endogenously produced reversible BTB modifier, could enhance the bioavailability of adjudin to affect spermatogenesis and provide a contraceptive effect in rats while reducing systemic toxicity.
   Study Design: We overexpressed F5-peptide in adult male rats (n=10 rats; with 3 or 4 rats for each of the three different experiments noted in the three regimens) by intratesticular injection of a mammalian expression vector pCl-neo (pCl-neo/F5-peptide) vs. empty vector alone (pCl-neo/Ctrl) to be followed by treatment with adjudin by oral gavage at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg. The status of spermatogenesis was assessed by histological analysis and dual-labeled immunofluorescence analysis on Day 16. To assess fertility, we allowed treated males (n=3-4 rats) to mate with mature female rats (n=3-4) individually, and assessed the number of pups on Days 23, 36 and 82 to assess fertility and reversibility.
   Results: All 4 treated rats overexpressed with F5-peptide and low-dose adjudin were infertile by Day 36, and half of these rats were fertile by Day 82, illustrating reversibility. However, overexpression of F5-peptide alone (or low-dose adjudin alone) had no effects on fertility in n=3 rats. These findings were consistent with the histology data that illustrated the BTB modifier F5-peptide promoted the action of adjudin to induce germ cell exfoliation, mediated by changes in cytoskeletal organization of F-actin and microtubules across the epithelium, thereby reducing the systemic toxicity of adjudin.
   Conclusion: In this proof-of-concept study, it was shown that overexpression of the F5-peptide prior to administration of adjudin to rats at a low (and ineffective dose by itself) was found to induce reversible male infertility.
   Implications: Overexpression of F5-peptide, an endogenously produced biomolecule in the testis known to induce BTB remodeling, enhanced the contraceptive effect of adjudin in rats, supporting proof of concept studies of BTB disrupters in men. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of the Woman's Condom (WC) over 6 months (183 days) and menstrual cycles in a US-based multicenter open-label phase III contraceptive efficacy trial.
   Study design: We assessed acceptability via written questionnaire at visit 2 (after the third cycle) and visit 3 (after the sixth cycle or >183 days, or upon early discontinuation). Key domains included ease of use, comfort/lubrication, sexual satisfaction, male partner satisfaction and confidence in pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention. We analyzed quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We conducted a content analysis to identify major themes from four open-ended questions.
   Results: Most women [327/405 (81%)] had limited or no previous experience with female (internal) condoms. Of 405 evaluable women, 346 women completed questionnaires at visit 2 and 303 women at visit 3; 282 women attended both visits. Of women attending both visits, 165/282 (59%) reported at visit 2 that WC insertion was easy/very easy; this increased to 195/282 (69%) at visit 3 (p=.03). Many women [166/281 (59%)] preferred the WC [105/281 (37%)] or were neutral [61/281 (22%)], while 115/281 (41%) preferred male condoms. Women attending visit 3 felt confident that the WC could prevent pregnancy [246/303 (81%)] and STIs [217/303 (72%)]. Many women expressed empowerment with having control over their contraception; some disliked the design, esthetics and insertion process. Most women (254/299 (85%)] would recommend the WC to a friend.
   Conclusion: The WC's acceptability and ease of use is promising for wider dissemination as a female-controlled method that can protect against both pregnancy and STIs.
   Implications: The WC's overall acceptability and ease of use is promising for a new female-controlled barrier contraceptive option that can protect against both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTIVES
AB Objective: Describe contraception availability at local health departments (LHDs) serving largely rural populations.
   Study design: We invited administrators at LHDs located in four Midwest states to participate in an online survey conducted from September 2017-April 2018. We collected data on clinic staffing, patient population, receipt of Title X funds, and services provided to assess the proportion of LHDs providing any prescription method of contraception; secondary outcomes included healthcare staff training level and other reproductive health services provided.
   Results: Of 344 LHDs invited, 237 administrators completed the survey (68.9%). Three-quarters served rural populations. One-third (34.6%) provided short-acting hormonal contraception; however, availability varied by state (Kansas: 58.0%, 40/69; Missouri: 37.5%, 33/88; Nebraska: 16.7%, 3/18; Iowa: 9.7%, 6/62; p<.01). Only 8.4% of LHDs provided IUDs; 7.6% provided implants, and 5.9% provided both methods. LHDs in Nebraska and Kansas provided any long-acting method more frequently (Kansas: 17.4%, Nebraska: 16.7%, Iowa: 8.1%, Missouri: 4.6%; p=.04). LHDs receiving Title X funds (27.0%) were much more likely to provide any prescription contraception (85.1% vs. 14.2%, p<.01). Most LHDs relied on registered nurses (RNs) to provide medical care; 81.0% reported that RNs provided care20 days per month. Pregnancy testing was widely available in Missouri and Kansas (>87%) and less commonly available in Iowa and Nebraska (<18%) (p<.01).
   Conclusion: LHDs in these states are currently ill-equipped to offer comprehensive contraceptive services. Women seeking care at LHDs have limited, if any, contraceptive options.
   Implications: Local health departments in the Midwest, serving a largely rural population, rarely offer prescription contraception, especially long-acting reversible methods. Women residing in settings without broad access to publicly-funded healthcare providers may have limited access to comprehensive contraceptive services. Efforts to ensure rural access are needed.

TI Effect of theory-based contraception comics knowledge: a pilot study
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Contraception; Comics; Patient education; Decision aid
ID UNINTENDED PREGNANCY; SUBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE; HEALTH; INFORMATION
AB Objectives: We assessed the effect on subjective knowledge of a pilot educational comic decision aid about contraceptive methods.
   Study design: We designed four comics (www.birthcontroltales.com), each about a different contraceptive method choice. The comics employ a theoretical framework, and the methods addressed were injection, intrauterine device, implant and combined hormonal contraceptives (including pill, patch and ring). The study population included young women presenting to a college student health clinic whose preferred language is English. Participants had not used the contraceptive method described in the comic and viewed the comics in color printed copy. We assessed contraception subjective knowledge using a pretest/posttest six-question survey with Likert scale responses before and after exposure to the comics. Surveys conducted during the participants' visit also measured participant satisfaction with the comic and participant sexual history.
   Results: A total of 120 individual participants divided into groups of 30 each viewed one of four separate comics. Across the four groups, the difference in the pretest/posttest scores of the six-question subjective knowledge survey indicated a 72% average increase (p value<.001).
   Conclusion: Comics about contraceptive methods can be a communications tool that increases subjective knowledge of contraceptive methods. Comics that model contraceptive choice decision processes can increase individual subjective knowledge of the contraceptive method mechanism, effect, usage, side effects, feasibility and benefits. Possessing subjective knowledge of contraceptive methods can influence contraceptive initiation and use and therefore has potential implications for changing contraceptive attitudes and behavior.
   Implications: Contraceptive method comics should be further examined in other clinic settings with broader demographic populations to glean the effect on patient decision and contraceptive behavior. Integration of the comics into a contraceptive counseling practice can be assessed in an observational trial. Additionally, studies should also consider testing long-term patient behavior, and both patient and provider satisfaction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID BILATERAL SALPINGECTOMY; PERMANENT STERILIZATION; PREVENTION
AB Objective: To compare intra- and postoperative surgical complications of opportunistic bilateral total salpingectomy during postpartum permanent contraception procedures in elective and unscheduled cesarean delivery.
   Study design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study (2010-2017) of women who had postpartum permanent contraception procedures during cesarean delivery, and we collected baseline characteristics, scheduling of delivery (elective versus unscheduled), operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL) and surgical complications (bleeding, iatrogenic injury, infection, anemia and relaparotomy). We classified patients according to contraceptive technique: bilateral total salpingectomy, bilateral partial salpingectomy with or without fimbriae, and other methods.
   Results: Five hundred twenty-eight women underwent postpartum permanent contraception procedures, 245 (46.4%) had bilateral total salpingectomy, 239 (45.3%) had bilateral partial salpingectomy, and 48 (8.3%) underwent other methods. We did not find differences in baseline characteristics, operative time and EBL among postpartum permanent contraception groups. Unscheduled cesarean delivery did not influence the choice of postpartum permanent contraception technique (p=.22). Postpartum permanent contraception related intraoperative bleeding occurred in 1 (0.4%) and 2 (0.9%) patients, respectively, in bilateral total and partial salpingectomy group (p=.23). Postoperative complications were 13 ( 5.3%) and 6 (2.5%), respectively, in bilateral total and partial salpingectomy groups (p=.11). Subgroup analysis confirmed no differences for intra- and postoperative complications during unscheduled cesarean delivery. We noted a 4.3-min increase in operative time for total salpingectomy after multivariate analysis (p<.01).
   Conclusion: At maternal request for postpartum permanent contraception during cesarean delivery, bilateral total salpingectomy can be a safe and feasible method even in case of unscheduled cesarean delivery.
   Implications statement: Our results suggest that bilateral total salpingectomy during any cesarean delivery may be an acceptable choice for its higher contraceptive efficacy and risk-reduction effect for ovarian cancer, at the price of a small increase in operative time.

AB Human activities have changed global nitrogen (N) cycling in the last decades. Global warming has potential to alter the decomposition of organic carbon. At the moment the effects of inorganic and organic N additions on litter decomposition, alone and in combination with increasing temperature, are not well known. A filed experiment of N addition (nitrate, ammonium and organic N) was conducted in the reed (Phragmites australis) wetlands in the Yellow River Delta, China. At the end of second growing season, the standing litter (leaf and stem) of reed were collected, and were incubated (90 days) to determine the combined effects of N forms and increasing temperature on litter decomposition. The CO2 production was defined as litter decomposition. The results showed that increasing temperature accelerated stem litter decomposition, and had no effect on leaf litter decomposition. Nitrogen additions inhibited leaf and stem litter decomposition due to the decrease in C/N ratio. Ammonium and organic N additions had larger inhibitory effects on stem litter decomposition compared with nitrate addition. This highlights the importance of differentiating the effects of N forms on litter decomposition. Moreover, the combined effect of N additions and increasing temperature on both litter decomposition was antagonistic due to the decreased Q(10) value of litter decomposition after N additions. Our results suggest that the negative effect of N addition on litter decomposition may be enhanced by increasing temperature in the near future.

AB Phytoremediation techniques can be used to decontaminate soil and water with residues of herbicides with longer residual periods that are highly leachable. Interception of these herbicides before they reach watercourses is an alternative method to manage these pesticides. Therefore, the present study aimed to select phytoremediator forest species under simulated conditions for riparian regions near cultivated lands where atrazine and 2,4-D are applied. The species Cedrela fissilis, Caesalpinia ferrea, Handroanthus serratifolius, and Schinopsis brasiliensis are not recommended for recomposition of riparian areas near agricultural fields where atrazine and 2,4-D are applied. Inga marginata was tolerant to atrazine and reduced the concentration of this herbicide in the soil. Specific bacteria present in the rhizosphere of Inga marginata may aid in the degradation of atrazine.

AB Protected areas are essential for both conservation of biodiversity and provisioning of dynamic ecosystem services. In recent years, invasive plant species have had devastating impacts on the sustenance of natural habitat for the in-situ conservation of threatened species. In the present study, we investigated the distribution pattern of Chromolaena odorata and Mikania micrantha and factors governing their spread in the grassland of Manas National Park. We carried out extensive field sampling and modeled the distribution of invasives using a suite of algorithms. Model predictions differed with respect to AUC, sensitivity, specificity and TSS range, largely in classification performance. Final risk maps were produced averaging the model outputs of Random Forest and MaxEnt for both the species. Subsequently, we also emphasized that the niche/SDM modelling studies should instigate by testing a suite of algorithms for predictive ability under the specific conditions of the study since no single optimization approach would be best under all circumstances. Proximity to the road and human settlement, elevation, fire occurrence and precipitation of driest quarter were the key predictors for both the invasive. The potential area invaded by the C. odorata was 74.87 sq. km and M. micarantha 81.82 sq. km, and a high degree of overlap found between the distributions of both the species. Invasion risk maps can be used as an early detection tool for the management of invasive species, which could help in minimizing the ecological significance and economic cost of invasions. The findings of the present study will help the forest authorities to manage, take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of invasive.

AB Nebkhas play a key role in the regulation of soil moisture in arid regions. In this study, we monitored the responses of soil hydrological processes to the developed nebkhas by adding sand to the origin dune in a degraded artificial Caragana shrubland from 2012 to 2016. No physical properties but infiltration rate were affected by sand addition in surface soils (0-10 cm soil layer). More specifically, soils in the 0-5 cm layer exhibited a greater cumulative infiltration and higher water holding capacity in response to sand addition. Compared to CK (nebkhas without sand addition), water stored in the 0-100 cm soil layer was greater in Sb (nebkhas with sand addition) at the end of each growing season in four out of the five years. However, greater local infiltration rates did not give rise to an increase in the depth of water recharge, but actually weakened the hydrological connections between the upper and lower soil layers. The changes in hydrological processes induced by sand addition indicated that there remains the question whether sand addition should be useful in the management of degraded Caragana forests, emphasizing the urgent need for further studies.

AB Roads have a multitude of negative effects on wildlife, including their prominent role in habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation particularly affects bats during their nightly movements between roosts and foraging areas. Bat overpasses are among the proposed improvements intended to reduce the fragmentation impact of roads, but they have rarely been tested. In this study, we performed a Before-After Control-Impact analysis (BACI) to assess the efficiency of one bat overpass on the number of bat crossings, by using an acoustic flight path reconstruction (AFPR) approach. We obtained 888 bat crossings of five taxa. Our results showed that the number of bat crossings increased significantly after the installation of the bat overpass. Finally, we demonstrated that an overpass correctly placed with respect to a narrow commuting route (a twenty-meter-wide hedgerow) could efficiently restore bat habitat connectivity.

AB The development of passage systems for migratory fish is crucial to mitigate the impact of river fragmentation. Concerning downstream migration of juvenile salmon (smolts), understanding their behaviour is a key to improving the efficiency of bypass systems. Among devices to improve efficiency, artificial lighting has proved effective in certain situations. Based on (1) recent observations of early migrating smolts where migration was delayed in the Poutes dam reservoir (Allier River, France) and (2) the fact that the implementation of bypass lighting devices was based on experiments involving later-season migrants, the present study assessed the effect of a lighting device on wild early-migrating smolts. One hundred wild smolts were tagged with acoustic transmitters and their behaviour near the bypass entrance under lit or dark conditions was assessed using 2D acoustic telemetry. A very abrupt change in behaviour around mid-April was observed, which directly affected their response to light. In the first phase of the downstream migration season (before mid-April), lighting significantly reduced the attractiveness of the bypass, while this surprisingly seemed to favour passage: smolts less frequently approached the bypass entry zone but passed through it more frequently. However, in the second phase (after mid-April), lighting attracted and kept the smolts close to the bypass entrance and significantly increased passage, corroborating previous experiments. The present study demonstrated an interaction between the development of migratory fish and their behaviour under lit or dark conditions. It also highlighted the importance of taking account of such behavioural change during the migration season when designing fish passage systems.

AB Perennial forages provide a range of environmental benefits in managing water, nutrients and carbon. This study examined the changes in soil organic carbon stocks and the underlying mechanisms in mixtures and monocultures of alfalfa-Medicago sativa and perennial grass-Leymus chinensis in established grasslands in a semi-arid region. In constructed grasslands three systems (L. chinensis monocultures, L. chinensis-M. sativa mixture and M. sativa monoculture) were assessed for biological N-2 fixation (BNF), biomass accumulation and nutrient store in aboveground shoots and roots, soil total organic carbon (SOC) and labile organic carbon stocks, as well as soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability over four years. BNF decreased by 59% from mixtures to M. sativa monocultures due to lower legume N fixation efficiency. However, the M. sativa monocultures had greater aboveground biomass and a significantly increased root biomass compared with other treatments, through increased soil N and P acquisition. M. sativa cultivation, especially as a monoculture increased SOC stocks at the 0-150 cm soil depth compared to L. chinensis monocultures but were dependent on root biomass carbon inputs. In comparison to L. chinensis monocultures and mixtures, M. sativa monocultures significantly increased soil labile carbon [permanganate oxidizable extract] at 0-150 cm soil depth, resulting from increased root biomass carbon input. We conclude that M. sativa monocultures, rather than mixtures can promote greater SOC, and in particular the soil labile organic carbon sequestration compared to L. chinensis monoculture in short term.

AB The invasive tree species Ailanthus altissima increasingly occupies forests in the southern parts of the Alps. Many of these forests grow on steep slopes and protect settlements and infrastructure from natural hazards, such as rockfall. It is feared that the mechanical properties of Ailanthus are less favourable for energy reduction of falling rocks due to lower wood strength as well as higher prevalence of heart rot. Therefore, the question has arisen whether the spread of Ailanthus will substantially change rockfall risk. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of the spread of Ailanthus trees in forest stands on their protective effect against rockfall. We first quantify the block energy reduction capacity of single Ailanthus trees based on a block-tree impact model and compare it to that of other species. Subsequently, we analyse the effect of Ailanthus on rockfall risk for different forest scenarios with a varying proportion of Ailanthus at the stand scale. The capacity of Ailanthus to reduce the block energy was quantified using a model of the block impact on a tree based on the Discrete Element Method. We then integrated the obtained results in the rockfall trajectory model Rocky For 3D. Based on rockfall simulations, we finally calculated rockfall risk for different forest scenarios representing current forest conditions and an increasing spread of Ailanthus. The energy reduction capacity of Ailanthus lies in the range of the species predominantly present in the study area, as well as other species that are typically found on rockfall slopes in the Alps. Rockfall risk for houses and roads does not increase with an increasing proportion of Ailanthus without change in the forest structure. Assuming a decrease in tree diameters with an increasing proportion of Ailanthus trees, rockfall risk, however, critically increased. Consequently, whether or not Ailanthus changes rockfall risk in the long term, strongly depends on its influence on the forest structure. To anticipate the evolution of protection forests invaded by Ailanthus, more long-term ecological data on growth and succession of Ailanthus at stand scale is required.

AB River embankments can be the potential semi-natural habitats for grassland species, although the recent disturbances for maintenance would alter overall vegetation of river embankments. For evaluating possibility of grassland species conservation in vegetation of river embankments, we aimed to clarify how does the previous maintenances (i.e. disturbance history) influence current species composition and diversity in grassland vegetation by changing soil properties. We conducted vegetation and soil surveys at 64 plots along the slope of embankments of the Tone River, Chiba and Ibaraki Prefectures, Japan, separated into 36 and 28 plots at disturbed and undisturbed embankments, respectively. We tested environmental factors (i.e., maintenance history, location of the river embankment, slope aspect, and interaction effects of the maintenance history and location) affecting species richness and soil properties of river embankments by using generalized linear models (GLMs) and linear models, respectively. We also evaluated species recovery through time by testing the significance of relationships between elapsed time (since last maintenance) and the richness values of all and grassland species. We found that disturbance history influenced current grassland species richness and soil properties (e.g. bioavailable soil P and percentage of fine sand) and grassland species have recovered gradually in the disturbed river embankments located on the outer periphery of the reservoir. For achieving synergy between flood mitigation and grassland conservation goals, grassland vegetation maintained on disturbed river embankments located on the outer periphery of the reservoir can be targets for restoration of grassland species.

AB The study presented in this paper aimed to improve the water quality of a small, stormwater-fed urban river and a cascade of ponds and reservoirs (Lodz, Poland) that are intensively used for recreation. We tested a combination of conventional restoration methods (bottom sediment removal and biomanipulation) and comprehensive ecohydrological restoration methods (hybrid systems, sequential sedimentation-biofiltration systems (SSBS), floating islands, landform-adjusted shoreline vegetation and plant harvesting). As a result of sediment removal (9795 m(3), cost: (sic)80761), almost 12.5 tons of nitrogen and 197 kg of phosphorous were eliminated from the reservoirs. The hybrid systems and SSBSs reduced the nutrient transport and suspended solid levels by 49%-98.5% and 89.6%-98.6%, respectively, from the upstream catchments to the reservoirs (investment cost: (sic)63929). Generally, restoration improved most of the water quality indicators, although an increase in the phosphate concentration was observed from 0.06 to 0.17 mg L-1 before restoration to 0.13-0.28 mg L-1 immediately after restoration as a result of disturbances resulting from bottom sediment removal. Four years after restoration, the concentrations of the total forms of nutrients and ammonium were still considerably lower than before restoration. The number of summer days with microcystins and with chlorophyll a concentrations above the WHO limits for recreational waters decreased. However, there was a gradual decline in the physicochemical parameters of the water due to the local impacts of human use (swimming and duck and fish feeding), rather than from other external or internal loads, which were effectively controlled.

AB Land cover changes are recognized to affect the organic matter fractions and other soil properties with a consequence for microbial and enzyme activities involved in nutrient cycling. The topsoil (0-10 cm depth) C, N, and P microbial [i.e., basal respiration (BR), substrate inducted respiration (SIR), microbial biomass-C, -N, and -P (MBC, MBN and MBP)] ratios, enzyme (i.e., urease, invertase, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase) activities, as well as the fractions of particulate organic matter (POC and PON) and dissolved organic matter (DOC and DON) were measured in a virgin natural forest dominated by Carpinus betulus and Parrotia persica (natural forest), mono-species Quercus castaneifolia stand (plantation), land including Citrus sinensis and Citrus tangerina trees (garden), land dominated by Brachypodium pinnatum and Carex sylvatica (rangeland) and land including rice cultivation (agriculture), following 32 years of land cover changes, located in northern Iran. The results showed that the soil MBN, MBP, PON, and DON were significantly higher under the natural forest site, while plantation enhanced BR, DOC, MBC/C-org, POC/PON, and DOC/DON. The planting of Quercus castaneifolia and preservation of natural forest significantly increased the amounts of soil SIR, MBC, POC, BR/MBC, and BR/SIR in comparison with the other studied land covers. Although the natural forest decreased the soil MBC/MBN and MBC/MBP indicators, the enzyme activities with maximum values of geometric mean of enzyme (GME) activities, urease/C-org, acid phosphatase/C-org, arylsulfatase/C-org, invertase/C-org, urease/MBC, acid phosphatase/MBC, and arylsulfatase/MBC were enhanced by Carpinus betulus and Parrotia persica stand. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in MBN/MBP ratio, Shannon's diversity index (H') for enzyme activities, and invertase/MBC index among the forest ecosystems and anthropogenic sites. Based on PCA, the natural forest followed by tree plantation presented good conditions of soil fertility as well as microbial and enzyme activities. While these characters were mostly suppressed in the non-forest land covers. As a conclusion, ecological stoichiometry of microbial indicators reveals clearly more soil responses to land cover changes than absolute microbial activities which can be used to measure long-term variations in the topsoil.

AB Hydrological modeling requires accurate climate data with high spatial resolution, what is often unavailable in a large fraction of the world. As an alternative to scarce meteorological observations, global reanalysis emerge as potential substitutes. Herewith, we compared CRU, NCEP CFSR, APHRODITE, and Asfezari reanalyses precipitation data with observed station data and SWAT applications using each of these reanalises to simulate the hydrology of the Maharlu Lake basin in Iran. In addition, we assessed the accuracy of these reanalysis in representing the local precipitation. Further, we employed observed and reanalysis precipitation in SWAT to simulate river discharge and evaluated the performance of the models. Monthly observed precipitation was best represented by CRU and NCEP CFSR (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.91), followed by APHRODITE (0.86) and Asfezari (0.80). In general, local precipitation was well represented by reanalysis products. According statistical metrics of the interpolation of CRU and APHRODITE were good and NCEP CFSR and Asfezari were satisfactory (Moriasi et al., 2007). Our assessment supported the use of reanalysis precipitation as a valid alternative to observations for hydrologic modelling in all regions especially in semi-arid basins.

AB Treatment wetlands are ecological systems that are engineered to improve polluted water quality through macrophyte, soil, and microbial remediation and are used commonly for urban and agricultural runoff treatment. However, constructed wetlands used for marine aquaculture effluent treatments are understudied when compared to their freshwater counterpart. We compared the nutrient retention and the microbial communities of two types of constructed wetland mesocosms, a vertical-flow treatment wetland (VFTW) and floating treatment wetland (FTW) in subtropical south Florida. To enhance nutrient retention efficiency, we implemented biodegradable plastic (polycaprolactone), as an external carbon source and monitored the performance of VFTW and FTW for the treatment of marine aquaculture effluent. Polycaprolactone surface were covered by various cyanobacterial genera including Oscillatoria, Leptolyngbya, Brasilonema, and Trichormus and some plastic-degrading bacteria such as Pseudomonas. The presence of a biodegradable plastic in FTW improved the overall performance of nitrogen removal (nitrite plus nitrate) by 14% through denitrification. The pattern of nutrient removal between two treatment wetland mesocosms were significantly different (p < 0.01), with over 87-91% retention of total nitrogen in VFTW and no retention in FTW, the latter due to poor retention of nitrite plus nitrate and production of organic nitrogen from the system not present in inflow waters. Total phosphorus was retained in both mesocosm types, with higher retention (74-81%) in the VFTW than in the FTW (17-40%). The nutrient retention in VFTW was higher overall compared with FTW mesocosms regardless of biodegradable plastic presence.

AB In this letter, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of the PtS2/InSe heterostructure using firstprinciple calculations. At the equilibrium interlayer distance D = 3.23 angstrom, the PtS2/InSe heterostructure displays a semiconducting character with an indirect band gap. Moreover, it forms a type-II band alignment, making the PtS2/InSe heterostructure a potential material for efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. More interestingly, by applying vertical strain and electric field, the electronic properties of the PtS2/InSe heterostructure can be effectively controlled, and a semiconductor-to-metal transition even emerges. These findings suggest attractive potential application for PtS2/InSe heterostructure as a novel optolectronic nanodevices, along with a potential pholocatalyst.

AB Carbon dots (CDots) exploit unique properties of small carbon nanoparticles, which represent the often underappreciated zero-dimensional carbon allotrope. The carbon nanoparticles in CDots could be modified by a selected organic chromophore of desired strong red/near-IR absorption in the dot synthesis to obtain a specific type of hybrid CDots. The reported results show that these hybrid CDots derived from the modification of core carbon nanoparticles by selected dyes or other chromophoric species represent a highly versatile and effective platform for CDots of desired optical properties and photoinduced redox characteristics in a by-design fashion.

AB In this study, the interaction of amphotericin B with human and bovine serum albumins has been investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Due to the limitations of several analytical methods by the known aggregation of amphotericin B molecules in aqueous solutions, fluorescence polarization technique was employed to determine complex stabilities. Besides the quantitation of reliable stability constants, this method was found to be able determine the stable aggregated amphotericin B fraction in the presence of serum albumins. Our results demonstrate the formation of highly stable albumin-drug complexes, suggesting the significant role of serum albumins regarding the plasma protein binding of amphotericin B.

AB Halon 2402 is one of the major ozone-depleting substances. The physical and chemical properties under the external electric field (0.0-12.5 V/nm) along the 1Ce7Br bond, including geometry, dipole moment, total energy, orbital energy gap, were studied based on the density functional theory with B3LYP/6-31++ G(d, p) method. Moreover, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of Halon 2402 with the field were also obtained by EOM-CCSD/6-31++ G(d, p) method. Furthermore, the potential energy curve along the C-Br bond under different electric fields was obtained and it implied that the stepwise dissociation of Halon 2402 may happen under the electric field of 15.0 V/nm, which provides important reference for the degradation.

AB In this paper, we investigate the role of structural dynamical effects on reactivity properties of selected Michael acceptors. To this aim, quantum molecular dynamics simulations were performed. Conceptual density functional theory descriptors were then evaluated on selected snapshots, providing statistical indicators suitable to assess the discrepancies between static and dynamical approaches. The implications of these results for building a predictive model correlated to Mayr's electrophilicity index are then discussed, paving the way towards a more realistic account of experimental results.

AB The finite difference approximation (FDA) allows us to compute dual descriptor correctly because it takes into account the relaxation effects that inner molecular orbitals experience. When these effects are irrelevant, we can use the frontier molecular orbital approximation (FMOA). Although FMOA omits relaxation effects and not FDA, both procedures should not yield too much different 3D representations of the dual descriptor. If so, the cause of such result lies in the fact that the respective basis set lacks diffuse functions, so artificially exacerbating the absence of relaxation effects aforementioned and yielding a remarkable inconsistency between FDA and FMOA.

AB The pressure-induced cubic orthorhombic transition occurring in HgF2 was investigated via X-ray diffraction and density functional theory. The predicted, ambient cubic (Fm-3m) fluorite structure of HgF2, can be obtained using a high-pressure ramp purification process of HgF2 mixed with XeF2. Subsequently, the purified HgF2 underwent a phase transition from the fluorite to the orthorhombic cotunnite-type structure near 4.7 GPa, persisting to 63 GPa. An equation of state fit yielded a bulk modulus K-0 of 94.4 GPa for the fluorite-type structure and zero-pressure volume V-0 of 168.6 angstrom(3), and K-0 = 92.9 GPa and V-0 = 156.4 angstrom(3) for the cotunnite-type structure.

The results show that the density of 1D TNA films is significantly improved with the presence of TiO2 compact layer (TCL) and the hydrothermal reaction time of 15 h. The TiO2 crystallinity is improved. The utilization efficiency of the visible light is increased with the lower concentration of crystal defects. The charge recombination center caused by the defects decreased, while the electrons and holes were effectively separated, thus the charge recombination rate was lowered, and better charge transport performance caused the transient photocurrent to increase significantly.

AB The charge transport and optical properties of aromatic ring substituents symmetrically-substituted diarylmaleic anhydrides is studied based on the Marcus-Hush theory and quantum chemistry calculations. The molecule with benzene substituents (1) exhibits the balanced hole and electron charge transport properties. Among three molecules, molecule with thiophene substituents (2) shows the maximum carrier mobility. The frontier molecular orbitals analysis turned out that molecule with indole substituents (3) is characterized as intramolecular charge transfer. The absorption and emission spectra indicate that the aromatic substituents can affect optical properties of molecules. 2 might be promising luminescent material for organic light-emitting diodes.

AB The NeH-based excited-state intramolecular proton transfer process of 2-(2'-aminophenyl) benzothiazole (PBT-NH2) and its three derivatives have been explored by the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) method. The scanned potential energy curves reveal that the energy barriers of the first singlet excited state of the four compounds along the ESIPT reactions are predicted at 8.74, 8.98, 6.72 and 1.69 kcal/mol respectively, suggesting that the inclusion of a strong electron-withdrawing tosyl (Ts) group can remarkably facilitate the occurrence of the ESIPT reaction, while the involvement of an electron-donating methyl group has slight opposite effect on the ESIPT process of the amino-type hydrogen-bonding system.

AB Solubility of SO2 in [N-2224][Met] was measured at temperature from 313.2 to 333.2 K and pressure up to 1.8 bar. The [N-2224][Met] absorbed SO2 at high speed and could be recycled for four times. The Reaction Equilibrium Thermodynamic Model (RETM) was used to correlate the experimental data, Henry's constant (H), reaction equilibrium constant (K-0), and thermodynamic properties (Delta H-r(m)0, Delta(r)G(m)(0), Delta S-r(m)0, Delta H-phy and Delta H-chem) were derived. Considering the absorption capacity and low absorption enthalpy, as well as the fast absorption process, [N-2224][Met] is thought to be a promising absorbent to ordinary solvent as a desulfurizer.

AB Based on density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function technique, we investigate the spin-polarized transport properties of the cyclooligomeric Mn-phthalocyanine dimer and Fe-phthalocyanine dimer with carbon nanotube electrodes. The results show that the spin-polarized transport properties can be effectively tuned by changing the central transition metal atoms, and the Mn-phthalocyanine dimer system can exhibit large dual spin-rectifying and high-efficiency dual spin-filtering effects simultaneously under the [1,-1] magnetic configuration. The underlying mechanism is analyzed by spin-resolved transmission spectra, molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian orbitals and their spatial distribution.

AB The potential application of porphyrin-like porous C24N24 fullerene decorated with a single Si atom (Si@C24N24) as a highly active catalyst for the reduction of NO in the presence of CO is investigated through the dispersion-corrected DFT calculations. The results reveal that NO can be simply reduced into N2O through the dimer mechanism. This reaction also produces O-ads species which is attached to the Si atom. Thereafter, the O-ads is eliminated by an incoming CO by overcoming small activation energy of 6.68 kcal/mol. These results demonstrate that the novel Si@C24N24 can be regarded as a pioneering metal-free catalyst for NO reduction.

AB Quantum-chemical calculations of excited state nuclear shielding constants are reported for singlet states in CH2CCH2, CH2O, CH3CHO, CH3NH2, and CO. The multiconfigurational self-consistent field method is used to account for static correlation in the excited states. With one exception, the molecules considered had larger shielding constants in their excited states than in their ground states. This tendency towards deshielding is rationalized using the sum-over-states expression for magnetic response.

AB In this study, the Ag3PO4/GO were prepared by ultrasound reaction. The Ag3PO4 exhibited an absorption edge at 527 nm and the band gap energies are 2.45 eV. The samples were applied to decompose tetracycline under visible light irradiation. The degradation rates of tetracycline by Ag3PO4/5wt% GO is 69.8% after 5 min irradiation, which is higher than others. After 5 cyclic degradation experiments, the degradation rate decreased form 77.7% to 74.9% after 30 min irradiation. It shows the stability of Ag3PO4/5wt% GO. Through the capture experiment, we know that h(+) and center dot O-2(-) determines the high activity of Ag3PO4/5wt% GO in tetracycline degradation.

A modified long-range corrected Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional (LC-wPBE), where the parameter w was tuned for reproducing the electron binding energies of the HCN monomer and small aggregates was applied in the liquid state calculations. The average HOMO energy of HCN is red-shifted by similar to 0.8 eV relative to its gas-phase value. The vertical electron affinity of liquid HCN is estimated as 1.08 +/- 0.38 eV.

AB The role played by single-atom vacancies on the electronic properties of in-plane heterostructures composed of graphene islands and hexagonal boron-nitride sheets is studied in the framework DFT calculations. Our findings show that boron monovacancy does not induce any nitrogen-nitrogen reconstruction whereas the carbon one induces a pentagonal reorganization for the carbon-carbon bonds. The removal of a nitrogen atom can yield a boron-boron reconstruction. However, such a bond arrangement does not take place in some cases suggesting that the relative mixing of carbon islands in hBN sheets improves the stability of boron-boron bonds.

The response of the hydrogen bond acceptors WZ, as gauged from their bond length change and the frequency shifts of their stretching modes, was investigated. The W-Z bond length change (extension or compression) depends on the sign of the WZ dipole moment derivative with respect to bond extension. The hydrogen bond strength and the WZ bond length change/frequency shift were found to be strongly correlated.

AB Au nanoclusters, stabilized by PVP, catalyze the aerobic oxidation of p-HBA. In this study, its principal reaction route was analyzed using Au-38. First, the arrangements of substrates, including ligands, were estimated. Next, these ligands were replaced with negative point charge of -1, and each system was re-optimized. The results obtained from these models exhibited the same tendency for the two reaction pathways. By estimating the electron density transfers between the substrates and oxidants, it was suggested that the electron affinity of the active oxygen species and Au NC is a good index for determining the main reaction pathways.

AB Designed inhibitors of 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase from previous experiments show high binding affinities. In this work, the binding affinities of these designed inhibitors are determined via free energy simulations. The calculated values agree well with the corresponding experimental results. Several structurally different inhibitors share extremely similar binding affinities. Detailed interaction analysis including the hydrogen bond profiles and the interaction energies between the ligand and its surroundings shows large enthalpy changes upon mutation from one ligand to another, while the binding affinities remain unchanged. This finding indicates the existence of entropy-enthalpy compensation.

Detailed characterization results reveal that these CsPbI3 crystals are single-crystalline with high thermal stability. The resultant composite nanofibers show wide bandgap of 2.71 eV and narrow photoluminescence full-width-at-half maximum (FWHM) of 29 nm, exhibiting fluorescence quenching phenomenon after thermal treatment. These composite nanofibers with a welldefined morphology offers new opportunities for high-performance optoelectronic devices.

AB For the first time, the poly(L-lactide acid) (PLLA) composites with C60 tetragonal single crystal (C60TSC) were fabricated through facile evaporation of the CHCl3 solution containing PLLA and C60. Results showed C60TSC in composites had side length in micron scale, and their mean size decreased, their number increased with C60 content in composites. The C60TSC in composites were face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice C60 single crystal composed of monomeric C60, and displayed blueshift relative to the UV absorption bands of C60. C60TSC formation resulted in PLLA composite with higher thermal stability, higher cold crystallization temperature as well as higher melting temperature than neat PLLA.

AB Au-based amorphous thin films prepared by magnetron sputtering were used to fabricate nanoporous gold by chemical de-alloying obtaining three dimensional bicontinuous ligament-nanopore structure. The surface topography and microstructure of the nanoporous thin films were monitored after varying the de-alloying conditions such as de-alloying time and electrolyte concentration. The as-prepared nanoporous gold electrodes were investigated for H(2)O(2 )sensing by CV curves and chronoamperometry techniques. The results demonstrated the nanoporous gold thin film exhibited high sensitivity towards H2O2 sensing under the applied potential of -0.45 V versus SCE, suggesting their use as H2O2 sensor.

AB Erbium-to-dysprosium energy-transfer and visible luminescence in the blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR is reported in PbGeO3:PbF2:CdF2 glass under 405 nm excitation. Absorption and excitation spectra were examined in the UV-VIS-IR spectral region. Emission showed a decrease in the Er3+ emissions around 520 and 545 nm when Dy3+ was added to the host matrix, while the Dy3+ emission around 576 nm (F-4(9/2) - H-6(13/2)) increased concomitantly. The recorded lifetime for Er3+ emissions also decreased, as Dy3+ concentration was increased for fixed Er3+ content. No similar behavior was observed when Er3+ concentration varied, confirming a one-way Er3+-to-Dy3+ energy transfer mechanism.

A dominant infrared electroluminescence was detected from the flexible Pe-LEDs, well agreement with the photoluminescence spectra. Notably, the Pe-LEDs exhibit excellent mechanical bending durability, confirmed by the almost negligible degradation in EL performance compared with the fresh device even after 2000 harsh bending cycles. The mechanism for the outstanding bending resistance was interpreted by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. Given the multiple advantages of flexible devices, current achievements will definitely expand application of Pe-LEDs. .

AB In this work, a nanodiamond-based sp(2)/sp(3) hybrid nanostructure composed of a nanodiamond (ND) core and sp(2) surfaces was fabricated for supporting Cu single atoms as a catalyst for selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. Cu supported on ND after annealing at 900 degrees C (Cu/ND-900) showed improved activity in comparison to the catalyst of Cu supported on pristine ND (Cu/PND). Surface analyses reveal that Cu single atoms display a high dispersion and an appearance of Cu-(0)/Cu-(I) surface state when supported on ND-900. Our work indicates a possibility of utilizing hybrid carbon structures with tunable sp(2)/sp(3) ratios for approaching improved-performance catalyst system.

AB The opto-electronic and thermoelectric properties of the XIn2S4 (X = Zn, Cd) thiospinels are studied by employing the density functional theory (DFT) based methods. The stability of thiospinels has been confirmed by formation energy. Direct and indirect bandgap for ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 respectively are observed. The values of band gaps that are determined with modified Becke and Johnson (mBJ) potential are good agreement with experimental values. The optical and thermoelectric properties are discussed in details. Our calculated values thermoelectric parameters such as ZT values equivalent to unity can be achieved for both thiospinel and make them promising candidate in energy harvesting devices.

AB The scattering phase function expressions of one single Fe3O4 particles (nanoparticles, microparticles) were obtained with Mie. Then the relationship between scattering phase function and scattering angle of Fe3O4 spherical particles with different scales with MATLAB. At last, COMSOL Multiphysics was used to model and analyze the energy attenuation of electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 2-18 GHz when they were passing through a sphere space randomly distributed by nano-Fe3O4 spherical particles. The variation trend between dielectric loss and magnetic loss in spherical space with frequency was obtained. Moreover, the energy loss of nano-Fe3O4 obtained by Mie and COMSOL simulation was compared.

AB We have studied the effect of a static external electric field on electronic properties of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and its consequences in an electro-initiated polymerization by density functional theory (DFT). The Conceptual-DFT scheme is used to obtain hardness (eta), electrophilicity (omega) and nucleophilicity (N) for MMA in gas phase and in a dielectric media. These changes on omega and N have been determined as a function of the direction and strength of the external electric field. This study give some insight on the enhancement of reactivity and, therefore, on the polymerization process under the presence of electric fields.

AB The practical application of VO2 smart glass is usually restricted by poor thermochromic property and contaminant. In this study, the VOx/SiO2 composite films were fabricated using magnetron sputtering and sol-gel preparations. Compared with VOx-based films, the VOx/SiO2 composite films showed the superhydrophobic property, and its water contact angle was up to 165 degrees. At the same time, the VOx/SiO2 composite films retained the original excellent thermochromic property with solar regulation of 13.95%, luminous transmittance of 37.34% and the low phase transition temperature around 38 degrees C. This study provided guidance for the combined application of VO2 smart glass and superhydrophobic coating.

AB The rate coefficient for the reaction of Cl radicals with n-propanethiol has been determined at 298 K and atmospheric pressure to be: (2.37 +/- 0.66) x 10(-10) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). Dipropyl disulfide, sulfur dioxide, and propionaldehyde, were observed as main reaction products. The yield of formation of dipropyl disulfide was quantified. Potential energy surfaces and thermodynamic data at 298 K were calculated for the gauche and trans conformers of n-propanethiol using the CBS-QB3, M06-D3/cc-pVTZ and M06-2X/cc-pVTZ levels of theory. We concluded that the formation of the prereactive complex in which chlorine is 'bound' to the sulfur atom is the decisive step in the reaction paths.

AB We have investigated chemical forms of molybdenum ion in nitric acid solution, using liquid-phase X-ray absorption fine structure, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, from a viewpoint of disposal of high-level radioactive nuclear liquid wastes. The experimental and theoretical results indicated that Mo is a hexavalent ion and forms a hexa-coordination binuclear-structured complex in the 2 M nitic acid solution. The predominant chemical species of Mo complexes in the 2 M nitric acid solution (which is used for HLLW) are assigned to be [Mo2O5(H2O)(6)](2+) and [Mo2O4(OH)(H2O)(6)](3+). These species may play a crucial role of forming so-called yellow-phase in vitrified objects.

AB Despite the simplicity of the K-2(+) alkali dimer with a single active electron, comparison of the ab initio results of Berriche et al. (2008) with those of Magnier and Frecon (2003) based on a model potential approach reveals a number of serious disagreement concerning several excited states. In particular, the 5(2)Sigma(+)(u), 6(2)Sigma(+)(g), 6(2)Sigma(+)(u), 7(2)Sigma(+)(g),7(2)Sigma(+)(u), 3(2)Pi(g), 4(2)Pi(g) and 2(2)Delta(u) states which are found to be repulsive by Magnier and Frecon, but attractive when ab initio techniques are employed.
   To clarify the origin of this disagreement, the adiabatic energies and spectroscopic constants are re-computed for the low-lying states of the K-2(+) alkali dimer within a model potential framework. Contrary to the claims of Magnier and Frecon, the new results based on a model potential approach agree well with the ab initio ones.

In this work, we introduced hydroxyl groups on the barium titanate (BTO), which yielded hydrogen bonds with fluorine atoms in the P(VDF-TrFE) matrix. The released energy density for 10 wt% modified BTO/P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposite film is 4.8 J/cm(3) with a charge-discharge efficiency of 74% at 150 MV/m due to transition of electroactive phase and improved interfacial polarization. This strategy provides simple approach for high electrical storage and commendable way for the commercial film capacitor.

AB Nanocomposites of TiO2 and carbon allotropes oxides (single and mull-walled nanotubes and graphene) have been prepared and characterized via scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and resonance Raman spectroscopy. The chemical interaction between TiO2 and the different forms of carbon was investigated and different levels of interaction was observed. More specifically, a selective electronic interaction process between TiO2 and semiconducting SWNTs is revealed.

AB The growth of zinc dendrites during cycling has constrained the development of the silver-zinc batteries. Herein, we focus on the practical application of polyethylene glycol with molecular weight of 200 as an electrolyte additive to the silver-zinc batteries. The cycleability of the batteries was significantly improved by introducing proper amount PEG-200 into the alkaline electrolyte. Further study shows that adding PEG-200 as electrolyte additive can effectively maintain the structure of the zinc electrode, and clearly inhibit the growth of zinc dendrites. At the same time, silver electrodes are not sensitive to the PEG-200 addition.

AB A DFT/TD-DFT method was employed to study the photovoltaic properties of some metal-free and metal-containing organic compounds (A-G) for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) application. Fluorescence emission (phi(f)) and charge collection (eta(c)) efficiencies were obtained by deductive logic, and were used to determine the dyes' incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE). These parameters were used to evaluate the dye's suitability for photovoltaic technology. The new approach could be a simple method of predicting dyes' photovoltaic activities while avoiding the laborious experimental trial and error procedures, although it cannot be used to predict the actual efficiency of a DSSC.

AB The coupled nonequilibrium processes of ATP synthesis in oxidative phosphorylation (OX PHOS) are tuned such that the system operates at optimal thermodynamic efficiency, eta. This state is compatible with maximum free energy dissipation, Phi under the imposed constraints. These results are shown to be consistent with nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Analysis of experimental data on rat liver mitochondria with succinate as substrate demonstrates that the total action of the system for a selected final state is a maximum compatible with the constraints, and that the system evolves with time to a minimum average unit action of 1.4 x 10(-3) J s natom O-1 mg protein(-1). This value of least average unit action corresponds to the highest efficiency of the system, compatible with the constraints to which the system is subject.

AB Acetyl protecting groups are commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry. Partially acetylated arylglycosides are not only useful building blocks in syntheses, but they are also substantial for plant metabolism. Nonselective base catalysis is often used for removing the acetyl groups. Even though acid-catalyzed deacetylation might be more selective, it is seldom used in carbohydrate chemistry, because it has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we study the acid-catalyzed deacetylation of per-acetylated phenyl glycosides experimentally and computationally by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on quantum modeling, we design a general scheme for the stepwise acid-catalyzed deacetylation of arylglycosides per-acetates. The approach can also be applied on gluco- and galactopyranosides. We have studied the deacetylation reaction in solvents of different polarity and found that the activation barriers of the stepwise deacetylation mechanism increase with increasing polarity of the solvent.

AB The time-dependent wave packet method is used to study non-adiabatic state-to-state Na(3p) + H-2(nu = 1, 2, 3, j = 0) -> NaH + H reactions, which are sub-processes in the formation of NaH from the collision between Na(3p) and H-2. Integral cross section values of the Na(3p) + H-2(nu) -> NaH + H reaction increase significantly when H-2 is excited to the nu = 2 or nu = 3 states. Products from the Na(3p) + H-2(nu) -> NaH + H reaction with three different initial vibrational states all prefer to form in vibrationally cold but rotationally hot states. Regarding the vibrational state distribution of the product from Na(3p) + H-2(nu > 0) -> NaH + H, our theoretical results are consistent with experimental results.

AB Synthesis of hematite-thermally reduced graphite oxide (alpha-Fe2O3-TRGO) composite for the dopamine detection was carried out by a simple chemical method. The introduction of TRGO into alpha-Fe2O3 improved electrochemical properties, resulting from larger electroactive surface area of composite (0.016 cm(2)), more than twice increase than that of alpha-Fe2O3 (0.008 cm(2)), and higher conductivity as well. The electrocatalytic activity of alpha-Fe2O3-TRGO was investigated by the oxidation of dopamine in which a linear response of dopamine was obtained in the range of 0.1-5 mM with sensitivity of 0.02 mA/mM, limit of detection of 0.06 mM, and correlation coefficient of 0.99.

AB In this paper, we reported a one-step and facile method to prepare boron carbon oxynitride (BCNO) nanosheet and titanium dioxide (TiO2) loaded BCNO nanocomposites. The BCNO nanosheet not only can widen the absorption range of TiO2 from ultraviolet to visible region, but also increase the photodegradation ability. The TiO2/BCNO nanocomposites have excellent photo-degradation performance on organic dyes. The TiO2-2/BCNO-2 nanocomposite can degrade almost all of methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) during 50 and 300 min under visible light irradiation, respectively. In addition, the photocatalytic mechanism can be explained by the electron transition process between TiO2 and BCNO.

Decorative morphology of MoS2 nanoflakes over MWCNTs interconnected high surface area nanonetwork supports the active path for the application of field emission. Drastic diminishing in turn-on field value has been obtained for MWCNTs/MoS2 nanocomposite compared to bare MWCNTs and MoS2. Hence, present investigation opens path for the development of low-temperature solution processed MWCNTs/MoS2 thin film in the field of nanoelectronics and the used process can be integrated for large scale.

AB The irradiation of linear chain alkanes in the liquid phase is shown to be an efficient method for the formation of a variety of polyyne, CnH2, species. The chemical products remaining in liquid octane, C8H18, after irradiation with 100 fs 800 nm laser pulses from a Ti:Sapphire laser system have been characterized using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and time of flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS). A reaction mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of long chain polyynes from the chemical products created during irradiation. This putative reaction sequence provides an explanation for the generation of polyynes incorporating more carbon atoms than present in the parent alkane.

AB On the grounds of a hybrid CCSD(T)/B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ anharmonic potential and the use of a variational and variational-perturbational methods, the IR spectra of dicyanodiacetylene C6N2 is revisited in the mid-infrared region up to 4500 cm(-1). A position and intensity analysis of our theoretical results allow us to assign the fundamental bands together with their combinations and overtones, in the aforementioned range of frequencies. The pure theoretical results are discussed in relation with the pure experimental data. The main objective of this paper is to give an 'a priori' complete IR spectrum of C6N2 which can be used as a guide of the low-intensity bands in areas not completely assigned so far.

TI Metal chalcogenide complex as surface exchanger in quantum
   dot-sensitized solar cells, recombination limited efficiency
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS

DT Article
ID INORGANIC LIGAND-EXCHANGE; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; SNS44
AB Metal chalcogenide complex (MCC) has been reported as a promising exchanger to link quantum dots onto photoanodes in quantum dot sensitized solar cells, which provides better chemical connectivity and electronic conductivity. However, the reported efficiencies are far lower than average efficiencies for quantum dot sensitized solar cells using traditional exchangers, which is majorly ascribed to the low short current densities. Serious electron recombination among MCC connected quantum dots are proposed and proved according to transient photoluminescent spectra, which reduces short current densities.

AB DFT calculations have been performed to gain insight into the mechanism of production 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from fructose catalyzed by a representative imidazolium-based ionic liquid (IL), 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bromide ([BMIM]Br). The overall barrier of the catalytic conversion is found to be 41.5 kcal/mol, which is in contrast to 75.6 kcal/mol located in previous literature. Different from the mechanism proposed in the literature, which Br anion of IL interacts with the hydroxyl group of the substrate via H-bonding to induce the dehydration process, while cation of IL acts as a spectator, the present calculations emphasize the collaboration of cation and anion of IL.

AB There is growing evidence associating inflammatory markers in complex, higher order neurological functions, such as cognition and memory. We examined whether high levels of various inflammatory markers are associated with cognitive outcomes at 4 years of age in a mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (Rhea study). We included 642 children in this cross-sectional study. Levels of several inflammatory markers (IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 alpha, IL-10, MIP-1 alpha, TNF-alpha and the ratios of IL-6 to IL-10 and TNF-alpha to IL-10) were determined in child serum via immunoassay. Neurodevelopment at 4 years was assessed by means of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between the exposures and outcomes of interest after adjustment for various confounders. Our results indicate that children with high TNF-alpha concentrations (>= 90th percentile) in serum demonstrated decreased scores in memory (adjusted beta = 4.0; 95% CI: -7.7, -0.2), working memory (adjusted beta = -4.0; 95% CI: -8.0, -0.1) as well as in memory span scale (adjusted beta = -4.0; 95% CI: -7.9, -0.1). We also found that children with high IFN-gamma serum levels showed lower scores in memory span scale (adjusted beta = -3.4; 95% CI: -7.3, -0.4). Children with elevated TNF-alpha/IL-10 ratio demonstrated decreased quantitative (adjusted beta = -4.3; 95% CI: -8.2, -0.4), motor (adjusted beta = -3.5; 95% CI: -7.5, -0.5), executive function (adjusted beta = -4.8; 95% CI: -8.5, -1.1), general cognitive (adjusted beta = -3.6; 95% CI: -7.3, -0.1), memory (adjusted beta = -3.8; 95% CI: -7.6, -0), working memory (adjusted beta = -3.5; 95% CI: -7.5, -0.5) and memory span scores (adjusted beta = -5.3; 95% CI: -9.1, -1.4) The findings suggest that high levels of TNF-alpha may contribute to reduced memory performance at preschool age.

AB The development of low back pain (LBP) is often associated with obesity and sarcopenia. However, the mechanisms of this association remain unclear. To clarify this, we measured circulating levels of a selected panel of soluble factors, presumably involved in obesity and sarcopenia pathogenesis, and correlated them with several LBP-related characteristics, taking into account body composition and other relevant covariates. In the cross-sectional study of 1078 individuals, we collected data on self-reported LBP, body composition (including fat and skeletal muscle mass) assessed by the bioimpedance method and anthropometrically, and measured plasma levels of several cytokines by ELISA. In the statistical analysis, we took into account familial composition of the sample and possible putative genetic effects. We report that LBP-affected individuals were significantly older, with increased obesity and decreased skeletal mass, respectively, compared with the non-affected group. In univariate analyses, plasma concentrations of Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), leptin, chemerin and follistatin were found significantly elevated in the LBP-affected groups (with or without sciatic pain) and were highly significantly (p < 0.001) associated with other LBP-related phenotypes, specifically, disease duration, disability and physician consults. However, after adjustment for one another, age, sex, body composition and putative genetic factors, the only associations between GDF-15 and LBP disability and medical consulting phenotypes, remained significant. In conclusion, we report for the first time, a significant and independent association between plasma GDF-15 concentrations and LBP-associated disability. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether GDF-15 could be a novel therapeutic target for prevention and/or treatment of LBP.

AB The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) defines the ability of senescent cells to express and secrete a variety of extracellular modulators that includes cytokines, chemokines, proteases, growth factors and bioactive lipids. The role of the SASP depends on the context. The SASP reinforces the senescent cell cycle arrest, stimulates the immune-mediated clearance of potentially tumorigenic cells, limits fibrosis and promotes wound healing and tissue regeneration. On the other hand, the SASP can mediate chronic inflammation and stimulate the growth and survival of tumor cells. The regulation of the SASP occurs at multiple levels including chromatin remodelling, activation of specific transcription factors such as C/EBP and NF-kappa B, control of mRNA translation and intracellular trafficking. Several SASP modulators have already been identified setting the stage for future research on their clinical applications.

AB Enzymatic transamidation of wheat gliadin by microbial transglutaminase inhibits IFN-gamma secretion by intestinal T-cell lines from celiac disease (CD) patients. Here, we analysed its effects on intestinal biopsies from CD patients and studied the underlying mechanisms in HLA-DQ8 transgenic (tg) mice, a model of T-cell mediated gluten sensitivity. In vitro challenge with a soluble form of transamidated gliadin (spf) upregulated IL-10 transcript levels in human biopsy samples. Furthermore, the ratio of IL-10/IFN-gamma transcripts was significantly increased following treatment with spf. In DQ8 tg mice, recall responses in vitro in the presence of dendritic cells pulsed with transamidated gliadin showed that gliadin-specific CD4(+) T cells did not produce IFN-gamma at any tested dose. On the contrary, spf-specific CD4(+) T cells still secreted IFN-gamma, but they also produced significant levels of IL-10 with both native and transamidated gliadin. Interestingly, this anti-inflammatory activity was restricted to a specific reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) fraction encompassing alpha-gliadins. These findings suggested an ability of transamidated gliadin to revert, as well as to prevent, the inflammatory phenotype triggered by native gliadin. This property was intrinsically associated with specific components of the alpha-gliadin fraction.

AB Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that are important effectors in the first line of defense toward transformed cells. This is mediated both by direct cytotoxic mechanisms and by production of immunoregulatory cytokines. Recent evidence has shown that NK cells also display memory, similar to the cells of the adaptive immune system. Cytokines are pivotal for the maturation, activation and survival of NK cells. Interleukins (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21 and type I interferons positively regulate NK cell function, either independently or in cooperation, whereas other cytokines, such as IL-23 and IL-27, may enhance or suppress NK cell function depending on the context. In the tumor microenvironment, TGF beta, IL-10 and IL-6 suppress NK cell activity not only directly, but also indirectly, by affecting immunosuppressive cells and by antagonizing the effect of stimulatory cytokines, thereby dampening the antitumor response of NK cells and promoting subsequent tumor evasion and progression. Increased understanding of the NK cell response to cytokines has provided a better understanding of their impaired function in tumors which may aid in the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance NK cell responses in cancer patients.

AB Objectives: The immunomodulatory properties of adipokines have previously been reported in autoimmune disorders. Less is known about the role of adipokines in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Lung and gastrointestinal tract are frequently involved in SSc; therefore, these organs were analyzed for adipokine expression as well as pulmonary samples of patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as comparison.
   Methods: Gastric samples (antrum, corpus) of SSc were analyzed immunohistochemically for adiponectin, resistin and visfatin compared with non-SSc related gastritis. Inflammatory cells were quantified in gastric samples and correlated with adipokine expression. Lung samples of SSc, IPF and healthy controls were also analyzed. Protein levels of lung tissue lysates and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) in minor fibrotic stages were measured by ELISA.
   Results: Lung sections of donor parenchyma showed significantly stronger adiponectin signals as IPF and SSc (donor vs. IPF: p < 0.0001). In SSc and IPF, resistin and visfatin were increased within immune cell infiltrates, but overall no difference in expression for resistin or visfatin compared to controls was observed. In BAL and lung protein lysates of early stages of fibrosis, adiponectin and visfatin were not reduced in IPF and SSc compared to controls. In gastric samples collected by standard endoscopic gastric biopsy, adiponectin was also significantly reduced in SSc-compared to non-SSc gastritis (p = 0.049) while resistin and visfatin were comparable although deeper fibrotic layers were not included in the respective samples. Adiponectin-positive tissues showed higher amounts of CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T cells. Controls showed no correlation between CD4(+) T cells and resistin, whereas SSc showed significantly more CD4(+) T cells in resistin-negative tissues.
   Conclusion: Adipokines are expressed in gastric and lung samples of patients with SSc and in lung samples affected by IPF. Prominently, adiponectin levels were reduced in fibrotic SSc gastritic tissue as well as in IPF and SSc lung tissue. Consequently, adiponectin expression seems to be associated with fibrotic progression in the context of SSc and IPF.

AB Background & aims: We have reported a significant association between HLA-G expression or the number of hepatic mast cells and liver fibrosis. Here, we investigated the role of HLA-G and mast cells in liver fibrosis, focusing, in particular, on interactions between human mast and stellate cells.
   Methods: Human mast cells (HMC cell line, CD34-derived mast cells, or tissue-derived mast cells) were co-cultured with purified human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and collagen I production by HSCs was evaluated. Mast cells and HSCs were characterized by immunocytochemistry. Various conditions were tested: different times in direct or indirect contact, presence or absence of cytokines, addition or not of HLA-G, and presence or absence of specific protease inhibitors.
   Results: The reciprocal interaction between HSCs and mast cells led to the attraction of mast cells to HSCs in vivo and in vitro, and to a significant decrease in collagen production, at all times of co-culture, following the direct or indirect contact of mast cells with HSCs alone or in the presence of TGF-beta, IFN-alpha or IL-10. We identified the diffusible factors involved in collagen I degradation as mast cell proteases. Moreover, HLA-G expression increased during the co-culture of HSCs and mast cells, with HLA-G acting on both mast cells and HSCs, to enhance collagen I degradation.
   Conclusions: Mast cells play a beneficial, anti-fibrotic role in liver fibrosis, via the HLA-G-mediated decrease of collagen I. These findings are consistent with high levels of cross-communication between mast cells and hepatic stellate cells and the role of HLA-G.

AB Aims: There is interest in using blood C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict adverse prognosis outcomes patients with type 2 diabetes. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between elevated baseline CRP level and unfavorable outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients.
   Materials/methods: PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched for studies on the association of elevated baseline CRP level with cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality from their inception to July 2018. Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated for the highest versus the lowest CRP level.
   Results: Six prospective cohort studies and two post hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials involving 22,322 type 2 diabetes patients were included. Meta-analysis indicated that type 2 diabetes patients with the highest CRP level had a greater risk of all-cause mortality (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.49-2.75) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.76; 95% CI 1.46-2.13). Subgroups analysis indicated that the increased cardiovascular and all cause mortality risk was consistently found in different study design, follow-up duration or patients with or without cardiovascular risk/established cardiovascular disease subgroups.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that elevated baseline serum CRP level is independently associated with future cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes patients.

AB Interleukins are cytokines involved in systemic inflammation and immune system regulation. Many studies have investigated the association between common genetic variations in interleukin-coding genes and COPD susceptibility. In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between interleukin gene variations and COPD pathogenesis.
   Association studies were retrieved from PubMed and Google Scholar databases using the standard systematic search strategy. A total of 26 different studies evaluating eight polymorphisms in four interleukin genes were included in this study.
   In overall comparisons, IL1 beta-rs16944, -rs1143627, -rs1143634, IL13-rs20541 polymorphisms were found not to be associated with the increased risk for developing COPD. However, IL1RN-rs2234663 and IL13-rs1800925 showed a strong association with COPD. We showed that the CC genotype carriers of the IL6-rs1800795 are at significantly higher risk of developing COPD (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.64, P = 0.01) compared to GG carriers. In case of IL6-rs1800796, individuals with CC and CG genotypes showed a lower risk to develop COPD (OR = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.32-0.66, P > 0.00).
   This updated meta-analysis strongly supports the association of IL1RN-rs2234663, IL6-rs1800795, -rs1800795 and IL13-rs1800925 variants with COPD.

AB Background & aims: The chemokines CXCL10 (interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 [IP-10]), CXCL11 (Human interferon inducible T cell alpha chemokine [I-TAC]), and CXCL12 (stromal cell derived factor 1 [SDF-1]) contribute to cell recruitment, migration, activation, and homing in liver diseases and their serum levels have been shown to be associated with the degree of liver inflammation or fibrosis in various etiologies. However, the data may be contradictory or insufficient, particularly for CXCL12, in the field of chronic HCV infection. Here, we aimed to provide evidence for these chemokines as biomarkers for chronic HCV infection.
   Methods: We analyzed the serum concentration of the three chemokines in healthy donors (n = 39) and patients (n = 87) with chronic HCV infection. Chemokine serum levels were compared to the stage of liver inflammation and fibrosis obtained from liver biopsies.
   Results: Serum CXCL10 and CXCL11 levels were higher at advanced stages of liver inflammation than at earlier stages, but the results were only of medium significance. Both serum CXCL11 and CXCL12 levels were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than those with low or medium stages of fibrosis. The AUROCs were 0.8167 and 0.8574, respectively, for the diagnosis of cirrhotic patients.
   Conclusion: These data provide evidence for the value of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL12 as biomarkers of liver inflammation and fibrosis during chronic HCV infection. Serum CXCL10 and CXCL11 levels were associated with liver inflammation, but the level of significance was insufficient. However, serum CXCL11 and CXCL12 levels were elevated in cirrhotic patients, showing equivalent diagnostic accuracy as the existing established single serum fibrosis markers or algorithms.

AB IL-17/IL-23 pathway has been hypothesized to play a role in occurrence and progression of gastric cancer. To investigate the susceptibility and prognostic value of polymorphisms in genes in the IL-17/IL-23 pathway to gastric cancer, we performed a case-control study combined a retrospective study in a Chinese population. The Sequenom's MassARRAY (R) genotyping platform was used to genotype the polymorphisms, and infection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was determined by using a commercial H. pylori immunogold testing kit. The results showed that IL-17A rs3748067 T allele carriers have a higher gastric cancer risk than non-carriers in the subgroup of individuals with age > 64 years old (CT/TT vs. CC: adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.04-2.29). The result of prognosis shown that IL-23R rs1884444 GG and rs6682925 CC genotype were associated with unfavorable survival (rs1884444 GG vs. GT/TT: adjusted HR = 1.40, 95%CI:1.02-1.93; rs6682925 CC vs. CT/TT: HR = 1.43, 95%CI:1.06-1.92), respectively. The stratified analysis revealed that the significant association of rs1884444 was maintained in the subgroup of older than 64 years old, and that rs6682925 was associated with unfavorable survival in the subgroup of female and patients received chemotherapy. In short, we concluded two polymorphisms (rs1884444 and rs6682925) in IL-23R were associated with prognosis of gastric cancer patients.

AB Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation. However, the function and regulation of eosinophils in AR are largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the expression and role of interleukin-36 (IL-36) cytokines in AR.
   Methods: Sixty AR patients and 20 control subjects were recruited in this study. The mRNA and protein expression of serum IL-36 family cytokines and IL-36R in AR were detected by quantitative RT-PCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA, respectively. IL-36R expression and regulation by eosinophils and the role of IL-36 gamma in the survival, adhesion, migration and activation of eosinophils were performed in purified eosinophils. Human nasal epithelial cell line was cultured and treated with different stimulators and IL-36 gamma was measured.
   Results: The mRNA and protein expression of serum IL-36 cytokines and IL-36R were significantly higher in AR compared with control, especially in asthmatic patients. Among the IL-36 cytokines, the expression of IL-36 gamma was the highest. The expression of IL-36R by eosinophils were significantly increased compared with normal controls and was up-regulated by recombinant IL-17, IL-25, IL-33 and Dennatophagoides pteronyssinus group 1. The IL-36 gamma promote the survival, adhesion, migration and activation of eosinophils. Human nasal epithelial cells can secrete IL-36 gamma after treated with recombinant IL-17, IL-25, IL-33.
   Conclusions: High expression of IL-36 gamma exaggerates eosinophilic inflammation in AR by promoting the survival, adhesion, and activation of eosinophils.

AB Background: Current biomarkers such as fetal fibronectin and cervical length are accurate predictors of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) in women with clinically suspected preterm risk; however, these are not effective for predicting the risk of sPTB in asymptomatic women. Therefore, we performed this study with the objective of determining whether the combinations of specific serum cytokines could accurately predict the sPTB risk in asymptomatic women.
   Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study with 129 incident sPTB cases and 258 individually matched controls who participated in an ongoing birth cohort study. The maternal serum levels of the selected 35 cytokines were measured. We evaluated the relationship between the multiple cytokines and sPTB risk using conditional logistic regression and elastic net model.
   Results: A panel of cytokines was significantly associated with an increased risk of sPTB. The odds ratio (OR) of sPTB per standard deviation (SD) increase of the predictive model score was 1.57 (95% CI 1.25-1.97) for the cytokines model. The combination of the selected serum cytokines was substantially more effective in predicting the risk for sPTB, as the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values were 0.546 and 0.559 in the single cytokine model and it improved to 0.642 in the multiple cytokines model (P-AUC (difference) = 0.02 for TNF-alpha vs. multiple cytokines; P-AUC (difference) = 0.05 for TRAIL vs. multiple cytokines). Moreover, the prediction was more accurate in overweight pregnant women, with an AUC = 0.879.
   Conclusions: The current study suggested that the combination of selected serum cytokines can more effectively predict the risk of sPTB in asymptomatic women compared with the use of single cytokine.

AB For the first time in the 21st century, we have an emerging body of research regarding contraceptive use among adult women with disabilities in the United States.
   We highlight key findings from population-based analyses that found higher odds of female sterilization and lower odds of long-acting reversible contraception use among women with disabilities compared to their peers without disabilities. We consider potential reasons underlying these differences, including discriminatory attitudes and policies that restrict the sexual and reproductive autonomy of people with disabilities. We advocate for a justice-based, intersectional approach to research on contraception and disability with the aim of promoting the reproductive autonomy of people with disabilities.

AB Objective: To compare efficacy, safety/side effects and acceptability of buccal versus sublingual administration of a misoprostol-only regimen commonly used for early medical abortion.
   Study design: We conducted a randomized trial at six clinics in two Latin American countries. We randomized women seeking early abortion to buccal or sublingual administration of three doses of misoprostol 800 mcg repeated every 3 h. At initial follow-up (7-14 days after misoprostol), we offered women without a complete abortion aspiration or additional misoprostol plus waiting 7 more days. The primary outcome was continuing pregnancy at initial follow-up. Secondary outcomes included continuing pregnancy at final follow-up, incomplete abortion, successful abortion, side effects, acceptability and complications. We analyzed all outcomes as intention to treat.
   Results: We enrolled 401 women and randomized 202 into the buccal arm and 199 into the sublingual arm. Continuing pregnancy at initial follow-up occurred in 11/201 (5.5%) and 2/189 (1.1%) women, respectively (p=.02). Additional misoprostol at follow-up increased success, defined as complete abortion, from 170/201 (84.6%) to 184/199 (92.5%) in the buccal arm and 165/189 (87.3%) to 177/189 (93.7%) in the sublingual arm. We found no differences by gestational age. Women reported similar acceptability and side effects across groups except for chills and fever, which women using sublingual misoprostol reported more frequently (p<.05).
   Conclusions: Sublingual administration was superior to buccal administration in reducing continuing pregnancy risk after a three-dose regimen of 800 mcg misoprostol. Complete abortion rates were comparable across groups, and in both cases, additional misoprostol at follow-up increased success. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID RESTRICTIVE LAW; IMPLEMENTATION; EXPERIENCES; SERVICES
AB Background: In 2013, Texas House Bill 2 (HB 2) placed restrictions on the use of medication abortion, which later were nullified with the 2016 FDA-approved mifepristone label.
   Methods: Using data collected directly from Texas abortion facilities, we evaluated changes in the provision and use of medication abortion during three 6-month time periods corresponding to the policy changes: before HB 2, after HB 2 and after the label change.
   Results: Medication abortion constituted 28% of all abortions before HB 2, 10% after implementation of the restrictions and 33% after the label change.
   Conclusions: Use of medication abortion in Texas rebounded after the FDA label change. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   immune globulin; Rh prophylaxis
ID HEMOLYTIC-DISEASE; PREVENTION
AB Objective: To describe fetomatemal hemorrhage (FMH) during second-trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E) to evaluate if Rhesus-immune globulin (RhIG) 100 mcg (used in the United Kingdom) and 300 mcg (used in the United States) provide adequate prophylaxis.
   Study design: We conducted an exploratory prospective descriptive study of women undergoing D&E between 15 weeks 0 days and 23 weeks 6 days of gestation. Enrolled participants had Kleihauer-Betke testing on specimens obtained before and after D&E. We assessed the main outcome measures of FMH in mL suggesting need for more than 100 mcg and 300 mcg RhIG (FMH of 10 mL and 30 mL fetal whole blood, respectively) and association of postprocedure FMH with demographic characteristics and procedure-related variables.
   Results: The 300 participants had a mean gestational age of 19 weeks 6 days 2 weeks 2 days. The median preprocedure FMH was 0 mL (range 0-50 mL) with 2 (0.67%) women exceeding 10 mL (19 mL and 50 mL). The median postprocedure FMH was 1 mL (range 0-60 mL). Almost all participants had postprocedure FMH <10 mL (n=295, 98.3%) and <30 mL (n=298, 99.3%). All participants under 18 weeks had FMH <10 mL. We found no demographic or procedure-related factors to be predictive of FMH quantity.
   Conclusions: FMH occurring with routine second-trimester D&E procedures is minimal. Adequate prophylaxis with RhIG 100 mcg and 300 mcg occurred in >98% of women and in all cases <18 weeks of gestation. This study is the first step to potentially reducing the dose and costs of Rh1G administration with D&E. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Pregnancy outcomes after removal of osmotic dilators in patients who
   presented for second-trimester abortion
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Osmotic dilators; Laminaria; Abortion; Termination
ID CERVICAL PREPARATION; DILATION
AB Objective: The objective was to report pregnancy outcomes and potentially related complications among 13 patients who had osmotic dilators placed for second-trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E) followed by subsequent removal with the intention to continue their pregnancies.
   Study design: We reviewed billing and scheduling data between 2005 and 2017 to identify the total number of women seen for D&E and to identify the individuals who had dilators placed without a subsequent scheduled dilation and evacuation. We then performed chart reviews to determine pregnancy outcomes.
   Results: Between 2005 and 2017, we treated 2532 patients who presented for second-trimester abortions by D&E and received osmotic dilators for cervical preparation. Twenty (0.8%) of these women had cervical dilators removed with the intention of continuing their pregnancies. We could obtain outcome data for 13 of these pregnancies; one of these women ultimately elected to have an abortion. Eight of the remaining 12 women (66%) experienced complications which included premature preterm rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, maternal infection and hemorrhage. Six (50%) pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion or fetal or neonatal death.
   Conclusion: Continuation of pregnancy after placement and removal of osmotic dilators may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Medical abortion; Second trimester; Day service; Service delivery;
   Quality of care
ID MIFEPRISTONE-MISOPROSTOL; BUCCAL MISOPROSTOL; TERMINATION; PREGNANCY;
   INTERVAL; SAFE
AB Objectives: Current service delivery models for second-trimester medical abortion typically include routine inpatient admission and ovemight stays. To assess the feasibility of a day-service model, we evaluated outpatient administration of abortion medications and analyzed the proportion of clients who could avoid an overnight stay. We also examined additional key elements of medical abortion care to evaluate the practicality of this model.
   Study design: We pooled data from six clinical studies of second-trimester medical abortion conducted by Gynuity over the past 10 years. We include 868 individuals receiving mifepristone-misoprostol abortion between 13 and 22 weeks' gestation.
   Results: At 8 h post misoprostol initiation, 309/521 (59.3%) participants at 13-18 weeks' gestation had a successful abortion; by 10 h, 382/521 (73.3%) were successful. Taking the mifepristone at home lowered neither the efficacy of the method nor satisfaction with the experience. Nonphysician providers played a significant role in the provision of care. Needed interventions were relatively rare; serious complications were very rare.
   Conclusions: Our findings support the provision of second-trimester medical abortion in a day-clinic setting, especially at <= 18 weeks' gestation. Such a model could increase access to quality care in many settings. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS
AB Objective: To evaluate public's interest in contraceptive options following heightened focus on a repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) since the 2016 United States presidential election.
   Study design: We monitored the fraction of Google searches emerging from the United States for the three most popular reversible contraceptive methods oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and condoms from January 1, 2004, through October 31, 2017 (1 year after the presidential election).
   Results: IUD searches were cumulatively 15% (95% CI: 10 to 20) higher than expected the year following the 2016 election, reflecting 10 to 21 million excess searches. IUD searches were statistically significantly higher in all states, except NV, and were consistent across states won by Trump or Clinton (Welch t test=0.60, p=.548). Conversely, searches for oral contraceptives and condoms remained stable (0%; 95% CI: 2 to 1) or declined (-4%; 95% CI: 5 to 2), respectively, following the election.
   Conclusions: The etiology of increased searches for IUDs is likely multifaceted. However, it may largely be because IUDs will confer continued protection even after an ACA repeal, thereby providing a medical hedge against a possible repeal. Regardless, these data suggest the heightened focus on an ACA repeal is a concern to the record number of Americans seeking out information about IUDs. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME; UNITED-STATES; PREGNANCY; PAIN; GENDER
AB Objective: To describe claims for contraceptive services among reproductive-aged women filling chronic opioid prescriptions.
   Study design: Using a large US commercial claims database, IMS Lifelink+, we identified women aged 1544 years who filled chronic opioid prescriptions (defined as a 90-day supply of opioids without a 30-day gap over a 180-day time period) and had continuous pharmacy and medical enrollment for at least 90 days prior to and 180 days following their index opioid prescription. After excluding women with any claims for pregnancy-related services, we describe claims for contraceptive prescriptions.
   Results: We identified 16,074 women with claims for chronic opioids who had filled an average of 135 +/- 28-day supply of opioids over a 180-day period. Of these, 23.4% (n=3759) had a claim for prescription contraception in the 90 days prior or 180 days following their index opioid claim. Of those who had claims for prescription contraception, 70% (n=2642) received oral contraceptives; only 2% had claims related to a long-acting reversible contraceptive (i.e., a contraceptive implant or intrauterine device).
   Conclusions: Commercially insured women filling chronic opioid prescriptions may have unmet needs for prescription contraception. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Healthcare provider survey
ID CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE; WOMENS KNOWLEDGE; UNITED-STATES; SERVICES
AB Objective: Identify factors associated with healthcare providers' frequency of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) provision to adolescents.
   Study design: We analyzed data from surveys mailed to a nationally representative sample of public-sector providers and office-based physicians (n=1984). We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cis) of factors associated with frequent DMPA provision to adolescents in the past year.
   Results: Although most providers (>95%) considered DMPA safe for adolescents, fewer reported frequent provision (89% of public-sector providers; 64% of office-based physicians). Among public-sector providers, factors associated with lower odds of frequent provision included working in settings without Title X funding (aOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.64), reporting primary care as their primary clinical focus versus reproductive or adolescent health (aOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.28-0.61), and providing fewer patients with family planning services. Among office-based physicians, factors associated with lower odds of frequent provision included specializing in obstetrics/gynecology (aOR 0.50, 95% Cl 0.27-0.91) and family medicine (aOR 0.21, 95% Cl 0.09-0.47) versus adolescent medicine, completing training >= 15 versus <5 years ago (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.83), and reporting that 0-24% of patients pay with Medicaid or other government healthcare assistance versus >= 50% (aOR 0.23, 95% Cl 0.09-0.61). The reason most commonly reported by providers for infrequent DMPA provision was patient preference for another method.
   Conclusions: While most providers reported frequently providing DMPA to adolescents, training on evidence based recommendations for contraception, focused on subgroups of providers with lower odds of frequent DMPA provision, may increase adolescents' access to contraception.

AB Objective: To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of levonorgestrel after 1.5 mg oral doses (LNG-EC) in women with normal, obese and extremely obese body mass index (BMI).
   Study design: The 15 mg LNG dose was given to healthy, reproductive-age, ovulatory women with normal BMI (mean 22.0), obese (mean 34.4), and extremely obese (mean 46.6 kg/m(2)) BMI. Total serum LNG was measured over 0 to 96 h by radioimmunoassay while free and bioavailable LNG were calculated. The maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), and area under the curve (AUC) of LNG were assessed. Pharmacokinetic parameters calculated included half-life (t1/2), clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss).
   Results: Ten normal-BMI, 11 obese-BMI, 5 extremely obese-BMI women were studied. After LNG-EC, mean total LNG metrics were lower in the obese and extremely obese groups compared to normal (Cmax 10.5 and 10.5 versus 16.2 ng/mL, both p<.01; AUC 208 and 197 versus 360 h x ng/mL, both p<.05). Mean bioavailable LNG Cmax was lower in obese (7.03 ng/mL, p<.05) and extremely obese (7.53 ng/ml, p=.198) compared to normal BMI (9.39 ng/mL). Mean bioavailable LNG AUC values were lower in obese and extremely obese compared to normal (131.6 and 127.5 vs 185.0 h x ng/mL, p<.05 for both).
   Conclusions: Obese and extremely obese women were exposed to lower total and bioavailable LNG than normal BMI women. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands are rich biological resources and support livelihood and nutritional security to a huge populace globally. In the present study, two ecologically distinct floodplain wetlands viz., Khalsi and Akaipur located in the sub-basin of Jamuna river in lower Gangetic basin, were studied for abundance, species richness and diversity indices of macro-zoobenthic communities across four seasons. The selected wetlands vary in terms of ecological regimes such as, water volume, depth, link channel, agricultural runoffs, macrophyte coverage etc. Khalsi, a seasonally open beel (wetland) that occasionally exchange water with river Jamuna during high flood, while Akaipur is a closed beel with no exchange of water. The studies indicated higher community richness in macrophyte dominated seasonally open Khalsi wetland (22species) as compared to closed Akaipur wetlands (20 species). The community abundance was higher in Khalsi (8496 nos/m(2)) as compared to Akaipur. Average Dominance, Simpson and Shannon diversity indices for Khalsi and Akaipur were calculated as 0.3, 0.7 & 1.5 and 0.2, 0.8 & 1.7, respectively. The community structure of wetlands revealed dominance of a single group, gas-tropoda (99%), followed by bivalvia (0.64%), diptera (0.27%) and oligochaeta (0.09%) in Khalsi, whereas, Akaipur depicted community structure with dominance of gastropoda (46.18%) followed by oligochaeta (41.36%), diptera (11.22%) and bivalvia (1.24%). The trophic state index (TSI) based on chlorophyll a (Chla), Secchi disc transparency and total phosphorus showed significant (p < 0.05) variations in both wetlands between different seasons. The water quality parameters were also significantly (p < 0.05) differ in both the wetlands except dissolved oxygen. The CCA components, CCA1 and CCA2 explained 27.59% and 23.95% and 39.78% and 15.26% of the species environment correlation in Akaipur and Khalsi, respectively. The distribution range of macro-zoobenthos varies 0.30-0.92 and 0.26-0.96 in Khalsi and Akaipur, respectively. The study revealed better ecosystem health of Khalsi beel in sustaining aquatic diversity while Akaipur beel is succeeding towards super eutrophic state. Thus, the present study provides baseline information on assemblage patterns and community structure of macro-zoobenthos in two important wetlands for sustainable management of the aquatic bioresources.

AB Oil sands mining in Alberta has disturbed large areas of peatland, the dominant regional ecosystem type, and no formal strategies exist to reconstruct the landscape. Peatland reclamation is challenging, but approaches are now being tested to determine the feasibility of rebuilding these valuable ecosystems. To evaluate our design concept, a pilot reclamation fen and associated watershed was constructed in an oil sands mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta. We implemented a large-scale multifactorial field experiment to test the introduction of bryophytes and vascular plants by moss layer transfer (MLT), seeds, and nursery grown seedlings under wood-strand mulch and with a Typha latifolia removal treatment. Four years after planting, the MLT and Juncus balticus seedling treatment supported the highest bryophyte and vascular plant cover and species richness. Removal reduced T. latifolia cover but was not necessary in areas where seedlings or MLT were introduced as it may have been competitively excluded by the planted species. The most successful fen species to establish was Carex aquatilis that spread quickly but also reduced the cover and species richness of bryophytes and other vascular plants. Water level influenced species distributions, with near surface water tables supporting higher cover of T. latifolia and lower bryophyte and other vascular plant cover and species richness. Our research demonstrates that it is possible to establish and maintain fen bryophytes and vascular plants and limit T. latifolia invasion in a constructed fen. To prioritize fen plant species richness and bryophyte cover, future projects should design for lower water levels, select species tolerant of expected abiotic conditions, and introduce nurse plants such as J. balticus. This research is the first of its kind to evaluate a range of species introduction approaches and demonstrates that it is possible to establish fen plants in the post-mined landscape of Alberta.

AB The seaweeds, Gracilaria edulis, Turbinaria ornata and Ulva reticulata collected from Mandapam East Coast region of Tamil Nadu, India has been subjected to vermicomposting in combination with cowdung (CD) in 1:1 combination for 60 days under laboratory conditions. The percentage decomposition was ranged between 83.70 and 87.00 in the vermicompost of seaweed + CD combinations while it was 30.71 and 35.12% in worm-unworked compost where the decomposition rate of substrates with earthworms is significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the substrates without earthworms after 60 days. The physico-chemical characteristics of the vermicompost showed increased levels of electrical conductivity, NPK, while organic carbon, C:N ratio and organic matter content showed reduction in all seaweed + CD substrates. A higher amount of NPK of 1.38, 0.69 and 2.41% respectively in the vermicompost of Turbinaria ornata + CD was recorded with the respective percentage increase of 50.00, 68.29, and 34.64 over compost, and the values were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the initial substrate as well as the worm-unworked compost of Turbinaria ornata + CD. The activity of earthworms during vermicomposting of seaweed substrates significantly increased the total microbial population.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment efficiency of a short rotation willow coppice (SRWC) vegetation filter for the treatment of wastewater from a municipal primary effluent in a humid continental climate context. The experimental work was carried out at pilot scale on a willow plantation located in Quebec, Canada. The experimental design included nine plots that were irrigated with groundwater (L0 = 14 mm/d) or two primary effluents (L1 = 10 and L2 = 16 mm/d) for 111 days. This research showed that SRWCs operated on coarse-textured soils allow efficient removal of organic matter (91% of COD for L1 and L2) and nitrogen (98% of TKN for L1 and L2) from wastewater. It was also shown, in this case, that the total nitrogen loading should be used as the limiting design parameter to minimize the risk of contaminating underground drinking water sources with nitrates. Almost complete removal of total phosphorus was observed during this experiment (98% for L1 and L2). However, a significant increase in soil available phosphorus was observed following the L2 treatment, which suggests an eventual phosphorus soil profile saturation in the event of continued wastewater irrigation. Avoiding such a saturation would require chemical phosphorus removal upstream of SRWC vegetation filters. Finally, an imbalance between irrigation and willows needs was observed as a result of irrigating plots at a constant hydraulic loading rate. Thus, irrigation of an SRWC with wastewater should be modulated according to willow seasonal transpiration trends to allow a better allocation of water and nutrients according to plant needs, and in doing so, increase treatment efficiency and resources valorization.

AB Constructed wetlands are important alternatives for decentralized wastewater treatment. In recent years, a large number of numerical models have been developed and refined in order to assist in the development and understanding of these facilities. This study presents a three-dimensional numerical modeling of flow in HSSF-CWs. The software MODFLOW and MODPATH, based on the finite difference method, were used to numerically simulate flow patterns in HSSF-CWs according to the project design and changes in porous medium hydrodynamics and flow distribution. The model proved to be a powerful tool for 3D simulation, allowing the representation of flow distribution, flow velocities, hydraulic head and particles trajectories. An interdependence of the hydrodynamic parameters and hydraulic characteristics in the porous medium was observed. Changes to hydraulic conductivity and flow distribution mechanisms can improve the flow patterns inside the porous medium, mainly because these contribute to homogenizing flow and eliminating low velocity zones, presenting the best results when coarse sand and two distribution pipes (located at depths of 0.1 and 0.25 m) were used. Proper design is important to improve the treatment conditions in these facilities and to prevent the occurrence of damage, such as clogging.

AB Erosion processes in the watershed and sediment transport cause hydro-morphological changes, eutrophication, and the loss of storage capacity in reservoirs. This study examines the tool for the optimal selection and implementation (TSI) of eco-remediation measures (ERM) in the river basin area to improve water quality and to reduce storage loss in the reservoir in question. The main purpose of this tool is to support decisions and measures taken to correct defined problems and to improve water quality and storage capacity in the watershed while minimising sediment transport. This tool enables the effective and necessary implementation of these measures to the most critical source areas (CSAs). In order to verify its operability, we selected the Ledava reservoir with a transboundary area of 105.25 km(2) in NE Slovenia and SE Austria. With the use of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), critical source areas were determined and the effects of eight different scenarios on sediment yield and load transport were simulated. The results showed that CSAs occupy 12% of the watershed and that sediment inflow into the Ledavsko jezero reservoir could be reduced by up to 30%. After determining the CSAs and which measures would be most effective, the implementation plan could be defined. Within this framework, the TSI enabled the selection of effective measures and contributed to the long-term improvement of the ecological status of surface waters required by Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), improving the quality of water bodies of all types to safeguard water ecosystems from harmful consequences.

AB Weir construction has fragmented many rivers, resulting in the exclusion of some fish populations from suitable habitat. A cheap retrofit fishway for small, sloping weirs is the Low Cost Baffle (LCB) solution - A series of notched baffles perpendicular to flow on the downstream weir face, generating an angled passage route across the weir face. To test the degree to which LCBs can pass upstream-moving, lowland-river fish at steep weirs, LCBs were fitted onto a 1:3.3-sloping gauging-weir face, in an urban tributary of the River Thames, England. The study also compared the passage of wild and stocked fish (the latter are employed to facilitate population recovery in restored English rivers). Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) antennas were positioned on the weir to record the upstream movement of PIT-tagged barbel (Barbus barbus; n(stock) = 120), chub (Squalius cephalus; n(stock) = 119; n(wild) = 194), dace (Leuciscus leuciscus; n(wild) = 50), and roach (Rutilus rutilus; n(wild) = 30). Over six months, more stocked fish attempted passage (58.9%) than wild (14.6%; chi(2)(1) = 26.7, p < 0.001), but there was no difference in successful passage of those that attempted (stock = 34.0%; wild = 40.0%; chi(2)(1) = 0.5, p = 0.49). Successful passage was achieved under a range of flow conditions. This study finds that LCBs have the potential to facilitate passage for cyprinid fishes at steep urban weirs that cannot readily be removed, but there is need for design improvements. This study also indicates that stocked and wild fish exhibited similar passage success, a finding with important management implications for achieving dispersal of stocked fish as a rehabilitation measure.

AB Grazing is widely regarded as a critical factor affecting the vegetation community structure, productivity and nutritional value of natural grasslands. To protect and restore degraded grasslands, fencing is considered as a valuable tool. However, it is not clear whether long term fencing of grazers can improve the condition and nutritional values of vegetation community and soil properties. We have compared the impact of long term fencing and continuous grazing on vegetation community structure, nutritional values and soil properties of alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by field investigation (11-13 years) and indoor analysis during 2015-2017. Our results showed that long-term fencing clearly increased the above ground biomass and coverage of plant functional types. Long-term fencing improved the development of four plant functional types (GG, grass species group; SG, sedge species group; LG, leguminous species group and FG, forbs species group), but inhibited the growth of noxious species (NG). Long-term fencing significantly improved soil TN, TP, TK, AN, AP and AK in 0-10 cm soil layer, considerable effect on the improvement of soil TN, TP, AN, AP and AK in 10-20 cm soil layer and soil TP, AN, AP and AK in 20-30 cm soil layer were observed. However, long-term fencing significantly decreased biodiversity indicators i.e., Richness index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Evenness index of vegetation community. A substantial decrease in the density, biodiversity and nutritional values (CP, IVTD and NDF) of four edible plants functional types (GG, SG, LG and FG) were recorded. While a downward trend in the TN, AN, AP and AK of above ground biomass and soil were observed during 2015-2017 in alpine meadows due to long term grazing. The density, diversity and nutritional value (CP and IVTD) of long-term fencing alpine meadows showed a downward trend over time (2015-2017). By considering the biodiversity conservation and grassland livestock production, long-term fencing is not beneficial for the improvement of density, biodiversity and nutritional values of plant functional types. Thus, our study suggests that rotational fencing and grazing would be a good management strategy to restore and improve the biodiversity and nutritional values of plant functional types in natural grassland ecosystem.

AB This paper presents a pilot study meant to reduce phosphorous (P) inflow into the Sulejow Reservoir (Poland) by constructing a riparian plant buffer zone enhanced with a limestone-based barrier along the reservoir shoreline. The location was characterized by high P contamination of shallow groundwater (with influent P-PO4 concentration ranging between 0.62 and 4.1 mg P/L and DP varying between 0.68 and 9.42 mg P/L). Firstly, we constructed a limestone-based barrier across the mount of a periodically flowing stream and tested its effectiveness at P removal over a period of 3.5 years. P-PO4 and DP removal effectiveness rates were found to be variable, increasing with influent concentration, but overall long-term average effectiveness was similar for P-PO4 and DP removal, at 12.4% and 13.0%, respectively. Secondly, we also planted six selected plant species along the shoreline and observed their natural ecological succession over the same period. Higher P uptake was observed for Schoenoplectus lacustris and Glyceria maxima one year after planting, whereas Phragmites australis needed three years to root. Furthermore, the species composition of the plant community increased from 17 to 34 species. Overall, the study provides an example of how the phosphorus recovery-and-reuse approach should be considered in improving measures for the reduction of diffuse pollution from rural areas, especially in terms of the development of nature-based solutions.

AB Man-made soils (technosols) could be a practical alternative when the availability of suitable natural topsoil is limited in surface mine areas for reclamation. Screening potential topsoils is a necessary step to determine the suitability of materials for revegetation. This study aimed to obtain insights into the growth of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) on homogeneous and layered initial soils prepared with local natural materials (sandy soil and montmorillonite-enriched sandstone), before screening the optimal topsoil for alfalfa growth. Ten technosols were assessed in a growth study over 5 months by using the biomass production and root system as performance indicators. The shoot and root biomass production were highest in the treatment with a 20 cm montmorillonite-enriched sandstone layer at a depth of 20-40 cm, where the biomass production rate was approximately twice that in sandy soil. The root distribution according to the depth was more even in a homogeneous mixture of sandy soil combined with montmorillonite-enriched sandstone and the treatment with a 20 cm montmorillonite-enriched sandstone layer at a depth of 20-40 cm compared with the other eight options, possibly due to the higher water-holding capacity of the montmorillonite-enriched sandstone. The optimal technosol was determined as a 20 cm montmorillonite-enriched sandstone layer at a depth of 20-40 cm in a sandy matrix. The results of this study using locally sourced components for preparing topsoil could facilitate the development of strategies for mine reclamation.

AB Natural sands and gravels have been a basic raw material for building ever since the dawn of civilisation. Even though the natural environment is transformed and may be degraded by gravel pits, these areas create wholly new conditions for the development of interesting assemblages of avifauna. This study was conducted in 2013-2016 in 64 gravel pits in east-central Poland. We examined whether gravel excavation led to the formation of habitats that support an avian community. We identified key factors affecting the richness, diversity and density of bird species, on the basis of which we were able to recommend practical conservation measures. The richness of species and their density were positively affected by the intensity of gravel pit exploitation: of prime importance were the extensively utilised gravel pits. The fewest species and the lowest density of birds were recorded in the most intensively exploited gravel pits, where the large sandy areas are an attractive breeding habitat for just a few species. The presence of emergent vegetation was found to be the most important factor influencing species richness and species diversity. This is the first comprehensive study to demonstrate the great value of gravel pits for breeding birds. We recommend that recultivation of these areas should aim at retaining the habitats of the most valuable bird species that utilised the gravel pit while it was operative. One-directional recultivation, be it the creation of woodland, farmland or a water body, should be avoided at all costs, because most of the bird species using the area before recultivation will abandon a homogeneous habitat. Another important task is to maintain or enable the existence of emergent vegetation around water bodies, as this has a considerable influence on birds.

AB In the last six decades, natural ecosystems in the Sanjiang Plain have undergone significant disturbance. Our study investigated wetland loss history and revealed the ecosystem service decline caused by wetland loss in this area. Based on multi-source data, we obtained wetland loss history since the mid-1950s. Then ecosystem service value (ESV) changes in response to wetland loss were estimated quantitatively in the Sanjiang Plain. Results indicate that wetland area declined by 73.3% (about 2.77 million ha) since 1954, mainly due to the transformation of wetlands to farmland. Wetland loss has reduced the ecosystem service value by $57.46 billion over the past six decades. The largest reduction in ESVs was due to agricultural expansion, especially that of dry farmland. Ecosystem services of all functions except agricultural product functions decreased in the past 60 years. Agricultural product functions increased at the expense of other functions. Wetland restoration and protection of existing wetlands are necessary to reduce the loss of ecosystem services as well as to promote sustainable development.

AB To study the effect of periphyton on water quality, we chose to start our experiment in the summer, when microorganisms are active. In this study, we constructed six experimental groups to simulate eutrophic lakes and used polyurethane sponges as artificial substrates to support periphyton. We systematically studied the effect of periphyton on water quality and nutrient removal by monitoring water quality indexes, including total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), and established two required attachment area equations of periphyton for TN and TP to calculate the attachment area of periphyton required to decrease the concentration of TN and TP, which can provide effective reference for practical engineering decisions. The results show that periphyton can effectively degrade nutrients in eutrophic lakes. The maximum nutrient degradation that can be achieved is Delta TN = 4.93 mg/L and Delta TP = 2.92 mg/L, which can inhibit harmful algae growth compared with the control group; the highest rate of Chl-a degradation was 85.8%. The coefficients of the required attachment area equation of periphyton under the TN condition are as follows: k(1-TN) is 0.1843, k(2-TN) is 0.0002, and the nutrient removal capacity per unit area of periphyton is alpha(TN) = 1.23 x 10(-5) g/m(2).day. Under the TP condition, the parameters are as follows: k(1-TP) is 0.0910, k(2-TP) is 0.0004, and the nutrient removal capacity per unit area of periphyton is alpha(TP) = 2.46 x 10(-5) g/m(2).day. In summary, periphyton is a potential microorganism for in situ lacustrine remediation; its positive impact cannot be ignored during the treatment of eutrophic lakes. However, considering the effects of season, climate and latitude on the harmful algae blooms and periphyton growth, the above equation is only applicable to the subtropical monsoon climate in the summer. Its practicability in other places and seasons remains to be verified.

AB Restoration is applied to reinstate geomorphic processes and complexity in degraded streams, but case studies of responses remain rare. A 236 m long reach of the Logie Burn, a straightened sand-gravel bed stream in north-east Scotland was restored by reconnecting its pre-modification channel to improve habitat and reduce nutrient transfer. Morphological, sedimentary and retention (wood, phosphorous and organic matter) responses were monitored over 3 years. Monitoring over 2 years was also conducted in a nearby control reach. A net deposition response of 64.3 +/- 32.1 m(3), a near two-fold enlargement of channel cross section area and a reduction of bed slope from 0.0008 m m(-1) to 0.00014 m m(-1) were observed in the restored reach over 3 years. The control reach in contrast was relatively stable. After 3 years, relative pool volume and morphological complexity were similar to the control reach and its pre-restoration state. Substrate diversity (Shannon-Wiener index: H') after an initial increase, declined but at the end of the monitoring period was higher (H' = 1.26) than the control reach (H' = 1) and pre-restoration reach (H' = 0.8). Following restoration, the median sediment size (D-50) of the majority of the restored main channel reduced from 3.4 mm to 1.5 mm - a similar value to pre-restoration (D-50 = 1.6 mm) - reflecting the net deposition response although the overall grain size distribution was not statistically different. No relationship between geomorphically effective flows and morphological change was found reflecting geomorphic sensitivity due to the reconnection work and wood recruitment mainly driven by tree collapse in response to channel readjustment. The retention of organic matter (OM) and total phosphorous (TP) did not increase in the main channel but did within the backwaters which also exhibited a statistically significant fining response. Overall, these results suggest that the physical habitat improvement value of the scheme so far has been limited but the creation of the backwaters may have increased the capacity of the reach to retain nutrients and fine sediment.

AB The use of fast-growing trees producing a high quantity of biomass can bring significant practical and economic benefits to the reclamation of marginal lands. The present study aims to identify new shrub/tree species to offer a wider range of shrubs/trees useful for phytomanagement practices. We implemented three experimental sites in France of 1 ha each (Thann, Carrieres-sous-Poissy and Leforest) contaminated by different potentially toxic elements (PTE) with a total of 38 different tree species. After two years of growth, the element concentrations in stem and leaf biomasses, tree survival rate and growth of plants were assessed. Although the three sites had elevated concentrations of total PTE and nutrients in their soil, the element contents in the trees strongly differed depending on the species. Alnus subcordata, Platanus orientalis, Ulmus pumila, Ostrya carpinifolia and the Acer species appeared to be well adapted to the drastic conditions of the sites and presented the lowest PTE concentrations in their aboveground biomass. Conversely, the Salix, Populus, Betula and Quercus species, especially Salix aquatica grandis, exhibited the highest accumulations of Cd, Zn and/or Mn at the three sites. Inoculation with the endomycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis did not have a significant impact on the growth of the tree species at the three sites after two growing seasons. Overall, the present study offers two options for the phytomanagement of marginal lands. The first option is based on the production of clean biomass, which is useful for plant-based industrial processes (e.g., biomaterials, bioenergy) that could valorize this biomass. The second option is based on the production of TE-enriched biomass that could be better exploited in the ecocatalysis process.

AB Healthy river ecosystems can provide fundamental ecological services for human survival and social development. However, previous studies that have sought to assess river ecosystem health have primarily focused on individual biological communities rather than on all aquatic communities and have been based on a single-index assessment method, thereby leading to large uncertainties in the results. In this study, we developed a new framework for the integrated assessment of aquatic ecosystem health based on the principal communities of fish, zoobenthos, phytoplankton, and zooplankton in rivers. An index of biotic integrity was used to evaluate the health of fish and zoobenthos communities, and a diversity index was used to evaluate the health of zooplankton and phytoplankton communities. To integrate the health assessment results from these four communities, a quantile normalization method was developed, where uncertainties in assessments obtained using the diversity index were well compensated for by the assessments obtained using the biotic integrity index. The framework was then applied to a pilot city, which is being constructed as a civilized freshwater ecological city in China. The results were then compared with those previously obtained based on the single-community method. Using this new framework, we found that the aquatic ecosystem health changed regularly in space and over time. Large differences were detected among the assessments of the four individual communities based on the single-community method, with the health score determined using phytoplankton being the highest, followed by that of zoobenthos, zooplankton, and fish, which made it difficult to reach a definitive conclusion regarding aquatic health status. The integrated assessment framework presented in this study successfully overcame the narrow perspective of the single-community method, thereby reducing uncertainties in the assessments based only on a single diversity index, and instead provides a comprehensive view of the status of aquatic ecosystem health. Thus, this integrated framework could assist river managers and stakeholders in developing comprehensive strategies for ecological restoration and water resource management and could become a key research tool for the health assessment and rehabilitation of aquatic ecosystems globally.

AB Continued re-eutrophication of Lake Erie has led to the updated 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (fully enacted in 2016) that established new binational phosphorus load reduction of 40% from 2008 baseline loading rates. Nonpoint source pollution is the leading cause of water impairment in agricultural watersheds; however, the water quality can be improved by implementing various BMPs for control of erosion and nutrient loss from watersheds. The Grand River watershed (GRW) occupies about 6800 km(2) and is an important agricultural area in Southern Ontario. Changes in land use over the past century in the GRW have led to altered hydrology and greater export of sediment and nutrient loads into Lake Erie. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of various BMPs in reducing sediment and phosphorus loading rates on various spatial and temporal scales in the watershed using SWAT for the years 2001-2010. The baseline sediment and P loading at Dunnville, prior to the Grand River's discharge to Lake Erie, were predicted to be 2 x 10(5) tonnes y(-1) and 2 x 10(5) kg y(-1), respectively. Different source, transport and water body treatment BMPs were simulated. With respect to reducing sediment and P loading into Lake Erie, implementing wide buffer strips resulted in a decrease of 23% and 50%, respectively. Stabilizing channel banks resulted in reduced sediment and P loading of 38% and 36%, while grassed waterways resulted in reductions of 15% and 17%, respectively.

AB Three parallel mineral filters, each with a volume of 2550 cm(3), were used for phosphate removal from natural swimming pool (NSP) water. Filters worked continuously in saturated conditions. Hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) were 15 m(3)/m(2)h, 15 m(3)/m(2)d and 5 m(3)/m(2)d for Filter 1 (F1), Filter 2 (F2) and Filter 3 (F3), respectively. In the middle of the length of the filter, an inspection hole was located for sampling the filtration material. Samples were collected on the 55th, 87th and 120th day of filter operation. The phosphate sorption capacity of materials sampled from the filters was significantly lower than the sorption capacity of the fresh material, with their values varying between filters (different HLRs) and sampling events. In the case of F3 (slow filter), a decreasing phosphate sorption capacity was observed along with the time of operation. However, filtration material sampled from filters F1 and F2 had a higher P sorption capacity at the end of the monitoring period (day 120th day) than at the time of second sampling (day 87th day). This may suggest that the biofilm which developed on the grains of the filter blocked the contact between reactive material (RM) and treated water. Breaking the biofilm due to a faster flow (F1 and F2) resulted in increased filter sorption capacity. The remaining material sampled from F1, F2 and F3 was dried and also tested for P sorption capacity. Results showed that air drying increased the P sorption capacity of material from below 50% up to 100% of initial value, which suggests that periodic drying of filters may be a simple option for the regeneration of filtration material. P-bounded forms in filters were also analysed and discussed.

AB Green walls, installed on the side of the buildings, mainly for their aesthetics and micro climate benefits, could become effective on-site greywater treatment solutions. However, far more research is needed to convert these nature-based systems into low-cost water purification technologies. This process study presents the first step in development of greywater-treating green walls by examining how variation in plant spaces and operational conditions (hydraulic loading rate, inflow concentrations and intermittent drying) influence nutrient removal from light greywater. The experiment was conducted over 12 months on a large-scale pilot green wall located in a laboratory in Melbourne, Australia. The results showed that ornamental plant species can successfully adapt to greywater only irrigation regime and play an important role in nitrogen and phosphorus uptake from greywater. Higher performing plants, C. appressa, N. obliterate, M. parvifolium and L. muscari, had on average 7-10% higher TN removal than unvegetated configuration (over 88% removal overall), which is attributed to consistently high NOx uptake. On the other hand, poorer performing plants O. japonicus, P. occidentalis and N. officinale tended to leach NOx, likely due to their shallow or slow developing root systems. While low retention times hindered high TP removal from all tested configurations, high dependency on plant species and operational conditions was still observed, with C. appressa and N. obliterata being the two highest performing plants (34-53% removal during standard operation). The overall phosphorus uptake was found to improve over time, suggesting that plant growth is a significant TP removal mechanism in green walls. While drying caused a performance drop for all designs, higher performing plant species were less affected by changes in operational conditions. The tested configurations showed good resilience to sudden inflow concentration increases, suggesting green walls could be used as a robust and aesthetically attractive on-site greywater treatment system.

AB Algal atypical proliferation is a consequence of water fertilization (also called eutrophication) and one of the main causes of the degradation of reservoir and lake ecosystems. Its intensification during the last decades has led the stakeholders to seek water management and restoration solutions, including those based on modelling approaches. In this way, this paper presents one reservoir eutrophication modelling based on a new hybrid algorithm that combines multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and differential evolution (DE) to estimate the algal abnormal proliferation from physical-chemical and biological variables. This technique involves the optimization of the MARS hyperparameters during the training process. Additionally, an M5 model tree was fitted to the experimental data for comparison purposes. Apart from successfully forecasting algal atypical growth (coefficients of determination equal to 0.83 and 0.91), the model showed here can establish the significance of each biological and physical-chemical parameter of the algal enhanced growth. Finally, the main conclusions of this research work are exposed.

AB Multi-channel rivers support diverse and productive ecological communities, and their rareness in the developed world places a great importance on their conservation. The design of side channel restoration projects remains poorly informed by theory or empirical observations. One of the last examples of anastomosing rivers in Europe is a stretch of River Narew in Poland protected as a national park. Park Authorities face a problem of side channels extinction in last few decades and therefore a dedicated plan of protection measures (submerged weir construction, dredging and mowing of side channels) was established aimed at anastomosing system conservation. The objective of this study was an ex-ante assessment of the impact of proposed protection measures on discharge distribution, flow velocity and sediment transport potential in the anastomosing section of the river, using a hydraulic, one-dimensional model. Among the tested measures, more invasive dredging and damming were significantly more efficient than less invasive vegetation removal. Compared to other restoration projects of multi-channel rivers (Narew and Rhone cases), supported by extensive post-restoration monitoring, efficiency level was comparable reaching on maximum tenfold increase in discharge and fivefold increase in reach-averaged flow velocity in restored side channels. Post-conservation alterations of hydraulic properties in the anabranches resulted in a significant increase in sediment transport potential for measures changing channel geometry. Such change could potentially ensure the stability of restoration eliminating the main cause of channels extinction i.e. excessive sediment deposition.

ID COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The effects of the global climate change on oceans and coastal areas are manifested in many ways. In coastal environments, the climate change influence on coastal ecosystems is particularly worrisome, affecting their configuration and restricting the ecosystem services they produce and their benefits to nature and society. This possible loss of ecosystem services translates well the significance of the "environmental risk" that climate change can cause. An assessment of the environmental risk generated by climate threats in coastal ecosystems was carried out through a South American case study developed on the Southern coast of Brazil - Estuary of Patos Lagoon. The study involved the implementation of a model that estimates the risk of losing ecosystem services used by different stakeholder groups as a function of (1) the climate threat, (2) the value of the service defined by the stakeholder perception, and (3) the vulnerability of each group in relation to a possible service loss. Based on information generated by scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and from a significant database collected from interviews of several service users, the model was able to generate levels of risks for different conditions. The calculated risk values, standardized to values between zero and one, allow numerous possibilities of evaluation for ecosystems, user groups and climate variability indicators. Moreover, the model appears as a tool capable of generating comparative risk levels and can help to establish environmental management policies related to the climatic effects and the necessary adaptations.

AB The coastline of the Department of Antioquia, in Colombia, supports a variety of ecosystems rich in diversity and abundance, but these are under intense pressure from human activities. Here, we propose a novel methodology for conducting ecological risk assessments of coastal areas that focuses on ecosystem health instead of benefits to humans, in which coastal zones are evaluated by prioritizing ecosystem risks based on four natural phenomena (erosion, sedimentation, mud diapirism, and invasive species) and two human pressures (pollution and land use changes). Ecological risk assessment of 16 ecosystems within the study area was performed using this new approach. Our research highlights the importance of monitoring land-use patterns as a primary factor influencing the threats and vulnerabilities of coastal ecosystems, in addition to demonstrating the usefulness of risk-management approaches based on ecological health.

AB Energy supply is one of the most critical problems that affect small and remote islands economic and social development. Alternative energy solutions are promising and favorable for small island purposes as they can be used in small-scale applications. In Colombia, most of the island territories lack energy access, and specific solutions need to be implemented for electricity supply. The Corales del Rosario Archipelago (Colombian Caribe) is a National Park of ecological importance due to its biodiversity and coral reef formation. It consists of 27 islands, from which Isla Grande is the larger one, and concentrates the human settlements (such as the Orika village, with about 500 inhabitants) and touristic activities. In this paper, we explore the energy situation and renewable energy potential in small non-interconnected islands around the world, to later focus on Colombian non-interconnected islands. As a case study, we evaluate the energetic situation in Isla Grande, and propose how renewable energy solutions could be implemented in the island. Primary and secondary information were collected from surveys with the local community, and supported by bibliography, and include information regarding energy demand and supply, hydrology (wave, tidal and sediment transport regimes) and meteorology conditions that could influence renewable energy resources (wind and solar radiation). Land coverage maps were constructed from satellite images, and used to delimitate shadow and no-shadow regions. A typical local house was selected for the energy demand calculations (8.05 kWh/day) and to propose renewable energy solutions. The hydrology analysis confirms no potential for wave and tidal energy solutions, while wind speed regimes are also not favorable for wind power implementation. Solar photovoltaic energy is, however, a promising solution for this island, where some individuals already have solar systems for self-consumption, while others use diesel generators. Individual home solutions should require about 11.6 m(2) photovoltaic panels, while a system that could provide electricity to the whole community should require about 1590 m(2).

AB Changes in hydrology are one of the main causes of mangrove degradation; however, the reforestation of mangrove has been the main restoration activity and very little information on how pioneer species can facilitate the colonization and development of the mangrove species is available. After carrying out a water reconnection as the sole restoration action, secondary succession has occurred in the mangrove rehabilitation area of Celestun (Yucatan, SE Mexico). Two pioneer species, Batis maritima and Salicornia virginica were observed in plots with different coverage (0%, 20%, 100%) where the three natural mangrove species were established, with Laguncularia racemosa as the dominant species in density. The greatest interstitial mean salinity (79.9 g/kg) was recorded in the plots with 20% cover, while the lowest salinity (40.7 g/kg) was recorded in the plots with 100% of coverage. At the end of sampling period nutrient content (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) and organic matter in the sediment were greatest in the plots with 100% cover, whereas the lowest concentrations were observed in the site devoid of vegetation. The percentage cover of S. virginica and B. maritima changed over time; in the plot that started with 100% cover it decreased until it disappeared at the end of the study period, whereas it increased in the plots with 20% and 0% cover. This study shows that B. maritima and S. virginica has a function as "facilitator species" initially colonizing the bare soil and modifying its conditions (decreasing interstitial salinity and increasing nutrient), which favored colonization and growing of mangrove seedlings.

AB Costal ecosystems like coral barrier reefs and mangrove forests have been designated as environments in need of protection. This is not only because they are threatened by climate change, but also because of the important role they play in coastal protection. Some field studies based on Rhizophora mangrove trees have analyzed the force induced by water flow over their roots and the wave dissipation capacity of these trees under tidal regimes and sea waves. Various methods have been used to calculate energy dissipation in the past, but these do not include the drag coefficient (C-D) with field data calibration. The study presented here was conducted to investigate the capacity of a small natural Rhizophora mangrove patch (at experimental scale) located on Isla Grande in the Colombian Caribbean Sea to mitigate wave energy. The total energy dissipation, including the slope bottom and the effects of vegetation, was calculated. Parametric equations were used to calculate the effects of vegetation. The drag force (F-D) was computed using Morrison's equation and the C-D was calculated using Mazda's method. The results show a mean energy dissipation difference of 9.6% between the energy balance and dissipation coefficients wherethe C-D was calculated for each sea state. The dissipation coefficients were calculated with constant C-D values (0.06, 3.48 and 6.90). None of the three cases could explain the 90.4% energy flux, as in the case of vegetation dissipation (D-veg) with calculated and non-constant C-D values. Despite the small size of the mangrove patch, the results show an increase in the C-D (with values of up to 7.9) as a result of lower values of the Reynolds number (R-e) (about 7.3 x 10(5)). This demonstrates experimentally the role that even a small patch of mangrove vegetation plays in attenuating sea waves (as C-D is a function of sea states), and higher magnitudes were obtained than those recorded in the literature using other vegetation types. A nonlinear contribution to energy flow by bottom dissipation and vegetation dissipation was observed. Our results highlight the need to scale measurements up to forest level in order to accurately quantify the impact of mangrove vegetation on wave attenuation and determine the possible impact on the protection of coastal ecosystems and infrastructure.

AB Tropical countries have island and continental ecosystems of great value for tourism, fisheries and also for their conservation development potential. These natural habitats, including among other beaches, seagrass beds, mangrove forests and coral reefs can dissipate wave energy acting as barriers against high waves and high water levels to eventually protect coastal infrastructure and communities. However, in recent decades, they have been subject to strong anthropic pressure and extreme events due to natural causes as well as to climate change. Therefore, the global trend is to understand the eco-systemic services that these natural environments can provide and their economic value in terms of reducing damages caused by coastal erosion and flooding. A methodological framework is presented in order to quantify the impact of natural ecosystems in coastal protection and their environmental assessment based on numerical models available in the literature. In addition to the methodology, a study of a typical Caribbean fringing coral reef and its response to different sea level rise and extreme events scenarios was conducted. The contribution of these efforts from a technological and scientific point of view, lies in the integration of different disciplines required to combine the physical properties of hydrodynamic studies with biological factors as an input to provide practical socio-economic and environmental solutions in those regions in which these ecosystems predominate. Furthermore, a numerical modeling tool to study wave energy dissipation, focusing the analysis on the impact of natural ecosystems (coral reefs) on coastal erosion and flooding was implemented. This information will help coastal managers and decision-makers understand the coastal protection services provided by nearshore habitats in order to improve and design new coastal development strategies under global change scenarios.

AB The Ecosystem Based Management approach is an opportunity to maximize ecosystem services while promoting ecological resilience and appropriate productive activities. However, implementing this management strategy relies on acknowledging spatial interactions between economic activities and ecosystem services as well as an effective communication between scientists and decision-makers. The lack in understanding those interactions and management decisions based on limited information has led to an unsuccessful transition between artisanal and intensive aquaculture in a Wetland of International Importance (NW Mexican Pacific). In this study, we evaluated the effect of aquaculture as a driver of wetland degradation and water quality and analysed the perceptions of decision makers and scientists concerning the spatial scale of aquaculture impacts on ecosystem services.
   From 1997-2013, we found that herbaceous wetland and croplands have been lost while grasslands, urban areas, aquaculture and mangroves have increased. Shrimp ponds were built on natural water bodies, herbaceous wetlands and croplands. However, perturbed mangrove patches are found near aquaculture ponds, mostly downstream. Water samples were analysed and differences were found between upstream and downstream sampling sites in the concentration of DO, COD, TS, salinity, SO42-, Cl-1, CaCO3, Na, Cr, Ni and Al. Sediment analysis showed that the amount of coarse sediment such as sand and gravel diminished significantly upstream and does not reach the river mouth. Finally, perceived spatial relationship analyses showed that most academics surveyed recognized that aquaculture could have a far-reaching impact outside the immediate production area. On the other hand, more than half of the decision makers who responded did not perceive any impact and the majority of the rest considered that the impact occurred close to the ponds. The likelihood of integrated coastal management strategies being implemented depends on the close collaboration of scientists and decision makers, on their understanding of complex spatial interactions, on developing appropriate management alternatives and on incorporating science in spatial planning and decision making.

AB The anticorrosion property of electrogalvanized steel mainly depends on the physical barrier of zinc's oxides or corrosion products to aggressive environments, which has reached a consensus for a long time. In this work, we demonstrated that the corrosion products (mainly ZnO) not only played a role of barrier layer in resisting seawater corrosion, but also provided an additional 30% of photo-generated cathodic protection for zinc coating under sunlight illumination according to the Stern-Geary resistance results. Then, we further elevated this sunlight-induced protection efficiency to approximately 100% by electrodeposition of nanocrystalline zinc, and analysed its improvement mechanism.

AB Recently, anodic TiO2 nanotubes have attracted increasing attention. Most studies only consider electrolyte temperature, but few consider electrode temperature, and no one has analyzed effects of the two temperatures on electronic current and ionic current. According to the constant-voltage current-fitting formula, effects of electrolyte and electrode temperature on ionic and electronic current are discussed quantitatively, respectively. It is concluded that electrolyte temperature mainly affects ionic current while the increase of the electrode temperature can accelerate the generation and rise rate of the electronic current. In addition, "spherical explosion" morphology formed at high temperature is proposed and schematically explained.

A global picture of the potential energy curves of the Lambda + S and Omega states, and the associated spectroscopic parameters provide reliable quantitative results attesting the thermodynamic stability of both species. Transition probabilities were computed for perpendicular and parallel transitions, and the corresponding radiative lifetimes evaluated. Trends in energetics and molecular properties are discussed for the series SrX2+ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) and CaX2+ (X = Br, I), and BaI2+.

AB Coadsorption of CO and O over five metal (111) surfaces under strain has been computationally investigated, which is relevant to key catalytic processes like CO oxidation. Strain sensitive/insensitive metals with respect to O and CO adsorptions are identified. For strain sensitive metals like Pd and Pt, the effects of strain and coadsorbates can be utilized to tune their catalytic performance, providing a new perspective on solving the problems of CO poisoning. For strain insensitive metals like Rh, Ir, and Cu, both effects are much weaker. Overall, the synergistic effect of coadsorbates and strain should be further investigated for catalyst design.

AB The reactivity of Pd/Al2O3-CuO catalysts was not enhanced with the increase of CuO contents and the Pd/AlCu50(1) performed best in ethanol oxidation reaction. The more PdO and less PdCl2 were conducive to the oxidation reaction. The larger quantity of Al3+ was conductive to the transformation from gaseous oxygen to active oxygen species and could provide more adsorption sites. The Pd-Cu alloy decreased the reduction temperatures of Pd and Cu oxides and enhanced the interaction between Pd and Cu species. Furthermore, the large content of high crystalline degree lattice plane (-111) might be beneficial for the higher reactivity.

The surfaces of the prepared OP@APTMS are functionalized with abundant amine groups. The OP@APTMS have been proven to be effective adsorbents for fast removal of gaseous HCHO, and its adsorption rate is three times more than that of commercial activated carbon (AC). On the other hand, the desorption rate of OP@APTMS-2.0 is extremely lower than that of AC, exhibiting its potential applications as an efficient and safe adsorbent for highly efficient removal of indoor gaseous HCHO.

The specific capacitance improved from 200 F g(-1) of PSS-GO to 250 F g(-1) for PSS-TRGO, at the scan rate of 50 mVs(-1). PSS-TRGO also displayed high energy density of 36 Wh kg(-1) with power density of 611.3 W kg(-1), revealing viability and potential for supercapacitor applications. The capacitance retention of PSS-TRGO was 97% after 1000 cycles, indicating potential high cyclic stability. PSS-TRGO, therefore, could be an excellent carbon based electrode for further energy storage devices.

Eu3+-doped CaTiO3 perovskite synthesized using an ethanol mixture solvent exhibited higher photoluminescence intensities for red emission than those synthesized using distilled water as a solvent. Ni ion-loaded CaTiO3:Eu3+ perovskite showed enhanced red emission and higher photocatalytic activities compared to those of bare CaTiO3:Eu3+ perovskite. The improvement of the photocatalytic degradation of toluene was attributed to the lower bandgap of Ni ion-loaded CaTiO3:Eu3+ perovskite, as determined by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.

AB Furanaldehydes have raised environmental attention due to their large emission and high potential to generate secondary organic aerosol. In this study, the removal process of 2-furanaldehyde initiated by NO3 in gas phase was investigated by quantum chemical calculations. The overall rate constant for trans-2-furanaldehyde initiated by NO3 is 1.04x10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 298 K and 1 atm. The atmospheric lifetime of 2-furanaldehyde with NO3 is estimated to be 0.53 h. This study indicates that the night-time reactions of 2-furanaldehyde with NO3 could contribute to the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, secondary organic aerosol formation and new particle formation.

The electronic properties investigations reveal that the predicted Li2S monolayer has a strain tunable direct band gap of 3.20 (4.05 eV) computed by PBE (HSE06) theory. As a wide band gap (WBG) semiconductor that is stable at high temperatures, this monolayer may have many applications in electronics and optoelectronics devices. Furthermore, the presence of a narrow phonon band gap between acoustic and optical modes suggests its application in opto-mechanical resonators.

AB Batch absorptive potential of biochar derived from date palm waste biomass (DPb) for lead (Pb2+) and copper (Cu2+) was explored and batch adsorption conditions were optimized in this study. Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and powder X-ray diffraction analyses of DPb were performed to characterize the adsorbent. An initial rapid adsorption followed by slow uptake of both Pb2+ and Cu2+ by DPb resulted in equilibrium times of 30-60 min and 2-3 h for Pb2+ and Cu2+, respectively. The optimum pH levels were 4.5 and 5.5 for maximum adsorption capacity for Pb2+ (98.9 mg g(-1)) and Cu2+ (41 mg g(-1)), respectively. Linear decrease in the metal uptake and removal efficiency occurred respectively by increasing the DPb dose (0.2 to 1.8 g) and initial concentrations of both heavy metal ions (50-250 mg L-1). The optimum amount of DPb for Pb2+ adsorption was 1.0 g, whereas the removal efficiency continued to increase for Cu2+ (92 mg g(-1)), up to the maximum dose used in this study (1.8 g DPb). The Freundlich-Langmuir (R-2= 0.95) and Harkins-Jura (R-2 = 0.92) isotherms were the best-fit models for the Pb2+ and Cu2+ adsorption data, respectively. A strong correlation between the pseudo second-order kinetic model and experimental data of Pb2+ and Cu2+ adsorption was observed, supporting the hypothesis of chemisorption as the rate-controlling step. Successful application of DPb for Pb2+ and Cu2+ point to its potential for economically beneficial large-scale application in wastewater treatment.

AB In this article, the aggregation behavior and shear properties of magnetorheological fluid (MRF) under different magnetic field strengths, volume fraction of magnetic particles (MPs) and shear rates were investigated by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. With the formation of a wall-like structure, the shear stress (tau) of the MRF increased linearly in the shear strains region 0 < strain (gamma) < 0.58. In the yield region (gamma > 0.58), the stress began to decrease and finally tended to be stable. The relationship between the aggregation of MPs and shear stress under a magnetic field-shear field was determined at the microscopic level.

AB The structural stability, electronic structure, and superconductivity of cubic sodium hexaboride NaB6 are calculated from first principles using density functional theory (DFT). The calculations of phonon dispersion spectra, formation energy, and elastic constants indicate that the cubic NaB6 is dynamically, thermodynamically, and mechanically stable, respectively. The cubic NaB6 has lower formation energy compared with the experimentally synthesized KB6. The calculated band structure and PDOS demonstrate the metallicity of NaB6. The superconducting transition temperatures at ambient pressure for NaB6 and KB6 are predicted to be 15.7 K with lambda= 0.60 and 14.6 K with lambda= 0.57, respectively.

AB Reaction F-2+ C2H4 -> F+ C2H3F (1) has been studied using a discharge flow reactor combined with an electron impact ionization mass spectrometer. The reaction rate constant was determined either from kinetics of the reaction product, F-atom, formation or from the kinetics of F-2 consumption in excess of C2H4:k(1)=(7.94 +/- 2.06) x10(-12) exp(-(3867 +/- 120)/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at T= 297-833 K. The reaction activation energy, 7.7 +/- 0.3 kcal mol(-1), is consistent with current theoretical prediction for the reaction barrier height and seems to solve the long-standing problem of the divergence between theory and experiment.

AB Via first-principles calculations, we investigate heterovalent doping of all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 with In, Sb, Tl and Bi, focusing on the electronic, optical and energetic properties. Results show that p-type doping can be achieved by replacing Pb with In and Tl, while Sb and Bi make CsPbI3 n-type doped. Energy gap of CsPbI3 can be tuned from 1.2 to 0.4 eV, leading to enhanced optical absorption at visible light region. Furthermore, we show that In, Sb and Bi are much easier to be doped, which explains available experiments. These findings may shed light on fabrication of optoelectronic devices based on perovskites.

AB Here we demonstrate high-performance ethanol sensors based on Fe-doped In2O3 mesoporous nanospheres. By using FDU-12 as template via a facile one-step impregnation method Fe-doped In2O3 were synthesized, which display high surface area, uniform shape, ordered mesoporous structure and small particle size. The Fe-doped In2O3 exhibited a larger response to ethanol gases than pure In2O3 under all measured concentrations. Furthermore, the effect of Fe/In molecular ratio on sensing property was investigated by comparing their response. The enhanced sensing properties could result from the unique mesoporous structure and the synergic electronic interaction between the guest Fe dopant and the host In2O3 material.

AB The dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in water under thermal excitation has been investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The pressure and temperature distribution of the combination of CNTs and water indicate that water molecules have increased kinetic energy under thermal excitation. The absolute value of the potential of mean force (PMF) and the mean square displacement (MSD) of CNTs significantly increase with the increase of temperature in the thermal excitation region. It can be concluded that CNTs have a higher tendency of separation at higher temperatures with the assistant of water.

Bond-path framework sets B and B-sigma, comprising a three-stranded, non-minimal 3-D bond, which included the familiar QTAIM bond-path and two additional paths defining the least and most preferred directions of electron density motion, were used with QTAIM and the stress-tensor respectively. The B and B-sigma were visualized and uncovered the destabilizing effects on the hydrogen bond of the presence of an Fe atom. The lengths of B and B-sigma quantified this effect and the dependence on the position of a fluorine substituent.

The ozone depletion potential for CH3OCF2CHCl2 was estimated to be on the order of 0.001 and a 100-year global warming potential of 4 was determined using a lifetime-corrected radiative efficiency estimation. Results are discussed with respect to the atmospheric chemistry of halogenated anesthetic gases.

AB Brushes made up of mixtures of polymers are modeled using mesoscale simulations under shear and the viscosity and the friction coefficient are obtained as functions of the chains' grafting density, brush composition, free chain concentration, and solvent quality. We find that brushes made up of mixtures of polymers can reduce to a greater extent the friction coefficient in comparison to a mono-chain brush and that both the viscosity and the friction coefficient obey scaling laws that depend only on solvent quality. These results shed light on microscopic mechanisms that affect viscosity and friction in polymeric brushes, which are findings of interest for research on nanotribology.

AB Crystallization kinetics of water on Ru(0001) with and without adspecies was investigated using reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Amorphous solid water is formed on the bare Ru(0001) substrate during water vapor deposition at 135 K; randomly oriented ice Ic crystallites grow after some incubation time. The nucleation and epitaxial growth tend to be aborted on the oxygenated Ru(0001) substrate, whereas ice Ih crystallites having considerable stacking disorders grow epitaxially on the CO-adsorbed Ru(0001) substrate immediately after water deposition at 135 K. Results indicate that epitaxy is controlled by the interfacial ice nucleation time and the water deposition rate.

In terms of the optimized geometries and variability of bonding pattern, electrostatic potential plots, frontier orbital features and spin density distribution, the calculated characteristics of noncovalent MPc + Sc3N@C-80 conjugates are generally more similar to the corresponding properties of MPc + C-60 than of MPc + C-80 dyads studied previously. However, the magnitude of binding strength for MPc + Sc3N@C-80 dyads matches more closely the interaction strength in MPc + C-80 series than the one for MPc + C-60 dyads.

AB The ubiquitous existence of water confined in nano-capillaries is key to fundamental biological and technological applications. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the hopping-like interlayer relocation dynamics of bilayer water confined between two parallel graphene sheets. In contrary to the common scheme that relocation is driven by density fluctuations, analysis of the transition path ensemble revealed that interlayer hopping is induced by local hydrogen bond configuration fluctuations coupled with activated consecutive transient angular reorientations. Our results consolidated the anisotropic nature of water relocation under strong ordering, which provided a mechanistic insight into the relaxation behavior at glass-forming water's fragile-to-strong crossover.

The Hirshfeld surface analysis was carried out to discuss the strength and role of the hydrogen bonds and other intermolecular contacts in crystal lattice. The crystal structures, vibrational frequencies, atomic charges and the related properties were also investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) method. The HOMO-LUMO energy shows high band gap energy indicative of stability of the synthesized compound. Interestingly, the synthesized product shows a higher antioxidant activity in a dose-dependent manner evaluated through different in vitro antioxidant assays and an interesting antibacterial activity.

AB The multigraft copolymer (A(2)B(2))(5), consisting of 10 side-chains (A blocks) regularly grafted on the 5 points of a backbone (B blocks), has been theoretically investigated by using self-consistent mean-field theory (SCMFT). We discussed the length scale of self-assembled morphologies and the corresponding phase transition sequences at different factors, including interaction parameter (chi) and volume fraction of A blocks. The free energy of formed nanostructures is a quadratic function of box size, leading to the identification of length scale at different conditions by the minimization of free energy with respect to box size. Moreover, by comparing the free energy between different phases, we observed a phase transition sequences, D -> C -> G -> L -> O-70 -> G -> C -> S -> D, which is consistent with that of simple diblock copolymer. However, this transition sequence changes as the variance of chi N and f(A). Finally, we constructed the phase diagram of this multigraft copolymer with respect to chi N and f(A), where O-70 was found to possess a larger region. Our calculated results show great guidance for the experimental study on the multigraft block copolymer.

AB FnHn+1+ cations (n = 1-10) have been systematically explored using ab initio MP2/6-311 + + G(d,p) and molecular dynamics methods. These cations possess chain-like geometrical structures comprised of the FH2 or F2H3 cores in dependence on the n parity. Ab initio molecular dynamics, as well as deprotonation and HF-reduction energies, suggest the stability of these cations. FnHn+1+ cations exhibit superalkali nature for n > 1, as their vertical electron affinity decays exponentially from 4.48 eV to 1.60 eV as n increases from 2 to 10. This study offers new insights into the protonated HF clusters and demands further explorations in this direction.

AB A semi-empirical Hamiltonian with the INDO approximation and CIS was parameterized to reproduce EOM-CCSD excitation energies for diatomic silicon Si-2 with different inter-atomic separations. The model Hamiltonian is transferable, producing excitation energies for clusters, Si-n (n = 3, 4, 5) with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.26, 0.18, and 0.09 eV, respectively, from the EOM-CCSD energies. The absorption spectra are also in qualitative agreement with the EOM-CCSD spectra. For clusters Si-19 and Si-40, comparison with TDDFT gave MAEs of 0.32 and 0.12 eV, respectively. Predictions of excitation energies and absorption spectra are also given for Si-n (n = 124, 147, 172, 779) using the model Hamiltonian.

AB The HfCo7 nanoparticles were synthesized by inert gas condensation, and the particle size was controlled by the condensation pressure. The particle morphology, size and size distribution were investigated by TEM. The crystal structure and surface chemical states of the as-synthesized nanoparticles were investigated by XRD and XPS. The magnetic properties were studied by VSM. The results showed that a higher pressure during the condensation resulted in a larger size and size distribution. Moreover, a larger size also resulted in better crystallization, higher magnetization, and increased air stability, which could be attributed to their lower specific surface area.

AB In the present work we suggest the general model of C-60 fullerene-ligand complexation, adapted for numerical description of UV-Vis titration data and for obtaining equilibrium complexation constants and some other complexation parameters. The principal novelty of the model is the account for two major processes governing the complexation process, and the account for broad dispersion of C-60 fullerene clusters by dimension. It removes the existing barrier for the use of absorption spectroscopy for quantitation the C-60 fullerene-ligand complexation.

AB In the present paper, we studied the structural, electronic and optical properties of monolayer alpha-PbO by performing first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. By analyzing electronic properties, we found that this monolayer in its pristine form is a direct semiconductor with a wide band gap of about 2.55 eV (3.45 eV, 3.7 eV) calculated by DFT-PBE (mBJ, HSE06) approximation which is sensitive to external strains. Optical properties calculations indicated that monolayer alpha-PbO has considerable absorption and reflection in the UV region of the electromagnetic spectra while, it is almost transparent in the visible region.

We explored that the CO2 gas molecule adsorption on the different elements X (B, N, P, Al) doped mono-vacancy graphene, the results showed that Al-MG was better than B-MG, N-MG and P-MG for the CO2 gas molecule with suitable adsorption strength and apparent band gap. Moreover, Al-MG had a chemical reaction with CO2 gas molecule and came into obvious charge transfers. So sensitivity to CO2 gas molecule made Al-MG was a promising candidate for highly sensitive gas sensor.

AB Experimental observations have confirmed that the addition of a single electron to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can excite the plasmon resonances in visible region (Lauchner a al., 2015). To gain more information, we fulfill a fully quantum-mechanical study of tunable plasmonic behavior in acene. The absorption spectra demonstrate that the molecular plasmons are tunable by addition or removal of single electrons. However, the plasmon exhibits a sharp different tunability for electron doping and hole doping due to the asymmetry electronic structure. Furthermore, the plasmon resonances in doped acene show a nearly linear relationship between the plasmon wavelength and molecule length.

AB The self-assembly behaviors of A-graft-B copolymer structured fluid droplets on a flat solid substrate were studied by using real-space implemented self-consistent field theory, where the long homopolymer chains were employed to fill the air region surrounding the droplet and the "masking" functions were chosen to fit the geometry of the flat solid substrate. It shows that the soft-confined spacing and substrate-surface affinity play important roles to regulate the self-assembly behaviors of polymer fluid droplets on the flat solid substrate. The microphase transition mechanism of the liquid polymer structured fluid droplet was reasonably explained by considering the wetting behaviors.

This work focused on investigating the binding and the degradation mechanism of biodegradable plastics polyvinyl alcohol by oxidized polyvinyl alcohol hydrolase (OPH) purified from Pseudomonas. Molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations (QM/MM) were performed for the investigation. The formation of hydrogen bonds between Gly65, Ser66, Va167 with ligand exert extremely important promotion effect on the reaction. Besides, significant electrostatic influence of Glu198 also contributes to the catalysis. These results provide valuable guidance to future mutation studies and enzyme engineering for efficient degradation of plastics.

AB In this letter, the room-temperature ferromagnetic behavior in the ZnO/CuO nanocomposites has been reported. The composites composed of ZnO and CuO with different ratios were prepared by hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) confirmed that these composites were made up by wurtzite ZnO and monoclinic CuO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that Cu ions on the surface of the materials were in a divalent state. Magnetic measurements showed that all ZnO/CuO composites possessed room-temperature ferromagnetism, while pure ZnO was diamagnetic. With the increase of CuO content in the composites, ZnO/CuO composites displayed the coexistence of ferromagnetism and paramagnetism, and paramagnetism was gradually enhanced and dominated later.

AB The initial Mn2+ binding site in photoassembly of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, the catalytic center of water oxidation in photosystem II, was studied using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. Among the five metal sites (Mn1-Mn4 and Ca) of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, the Mn1 site involving D1-H332 was most stable for Mn(2+ )binding, while the Mn2 site showed a slightly higher energy comparable to the thermal fluctuation energy at room temperature. It is thus suggested that Mn2+ binding at the Mn1 site, likely in equilibrium with that at the Mn2 site, is the initial step of photoassembly of the Mn4CaO5 cluster.

AB All perovskite p-i-n junction La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3/La0.7Te0.3MnO3 heterostructures were epitaxially deposited on (0 0 1) SrTiO3 substrates. Crystallinities and strain were investigated for p-i-n junction layers. The heterostructures show excellent ferroelectric and switchable domain structures. With the rising temperature, the junctions exhibit a transition from a p-i-n junction (hole/electron) with remarkable diode effect to a p-i-p like junction (hole/small polaron) with a small rectification. The temperature-dependent rectification of p-i-n junctions with 10 nm PZT layer show the consistent trend with that of junctions with 20 nm PZT layer. Our result indicated that the p-i-n junction may provide potential for further research and application.

AB The low energy structures of neutral carbon clusters C-n (n. = 11, 12) are predicted by means of particle swarm optimization and quantum chemistry calculation. The energy and geometrical structure of these isomers are further optimized by DFT, MP2 and CCSD computation methods. The relative Gibbs free energy below 5000 K was calculated, which indicates that C-11 clusters are more sensitive to temperature. We also illustrate the computational simulated IR spectra obtained at B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level, which shown the vibrational modes and vibrational regions of different structural isomers. Combining nuclear independent chemical shift (NICS) and harmonic oscillator measure of aromaticity (HOMA), we have analyzed the aromaticity of the three single-ring structures and found that C-11 cluster is not aromatic, while the ground stated structure of C-12 is anti-aromaticity. Chemical bond analysis of the ground state is performed by Adaptive Natural Density Partition (AdNDP) injunction with electron localization function (ELF), it is found that the 2c-2e bonds of C-11 and C-12 planar ring structures presented strong and weak alternations, respectively, and their multi-central bonds were strongly dependent on the symmetry of molecular configuration. Finally, topological and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis indicate that there is no electrostatic interaction in the C-n (n. = 11, 12) clusters, and the high angular momentum orbital has a primary contribution to negative natural valance electron configuration. From the electronic configuration, we can see that the natural hybridized orbit of C-11 and C-12 clusters is mainly composed of sp hybrids.

AB MP2/aug'-cc-pVTZ calculations have been carried out to determine the structures and binding energies of complexes SC:SHX, for X = NO2, NC, F, Cl, CN, CCH, and NH2. Complexes with traditional chalcogen bonds exist on all surfaces except for X = F and Cl, while complexes with sulfur-shared chalcogen bonds exist when X = F, NO2, NC, and Cl. The transition structures which present the barriers to converting one equilibrium structure to another on surfaces with double minima have been obtained. Charge-transfer energies, AIM parameters, NMR chemical shieldings, and EOM-CCSD spin-spin coupling constants across chalcogen bonds characterize these complexes.

Assignment of the p-ethylbenzyl radical was confirmed by comparing the spectra from p-xylene and p-ethyltoluene. The geometry optimization and vibrational frequencies of the p-ethylbenzyl radical were computed with density functional calculation. Conclusive vibronic band assignment was analyzed with a Franck-Condon simulation in the D-0-D-1 transition.

When a camphor boat was connected to a water-floating disk or another camphor boat through a rod, we found that regular dynamics of the camphor boat appear and depend on the mobility restriction of the disk, the rod length, and the position of a slit of the camphor boat. We performed numerical simulations to reproduce the observed motions with theoretical models including constraint conditions.

AB Gold nanorods (GNRs) Janus membranes have been synthesized with thiol-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG-SH) and thiol-terminated polystyrene (PS-SH) at the oil/water interface by modified self-assembly strategy. Compared with conventional GNRs membrane, these membranes exhibit significant surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks and an obvious blue shift with the addition of PEG-SH or PS-SH. Moreover, the Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance and reproducibility of the GNRs Janus membranes have been improved significantly. This indicates GNRs Janus membranes have great application prospects in optical applications such as science-based optical sensor design and SERS sensitive detection.

TI Alpha-fluorescence (alpha S-1) from thermally stable carbon nanodots

ID PHOSPHORESCENCE; DOTS
AB Fluorescence from carbon nanodots has been of keen interest over the past decade; however, exploration of radiative pathways including delayed fluorescence (alpha S-1) from nanodots have hitherto seen little investigation, thus limiting the scope of nanodot applications. Simple synthesis strategies for alpha S-1-emitting nanodots therefore remain necessary. Herein we report an inexpensive, quasi-spherical nanodot structure from combustion-based synthesis exhibiting strong excitation-dependent alpha S-1 emission upon aggregation to 100 nm sizes. Interestingly, alpha S-1 emission intensity is found to increase with increased temperature. The nanodots also exhibit photostability over multiple heating and cooling cycles, suggesting the possible use of these carbon nanodots as temperature-sensitive luminescence probes.

AB The synthesis of TiO2 nanotubular films is presented together with their physical, chemical, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical characterization in order to assess their use as photocatalyst. The synthesis was made through the anodic oxidation procedure using an inorganic fluoride based electrolyte. The nanotubes presented an inner diameter of 54 nm, a wall thickness of 18 nm and a length of 570 nm in amorphous condition. After annealing at 500 degrees C the alignment and definition of the nanotubes were improved observing more space between the nanotubes, contrary to that observed at 700 degrees C, in which a detrimental morphology was seen, presenting a disruption of a little portion of the superior edge of the nanotubes. The electrochemical characterization was made for four samples: the amorphous one and two crystallized samples at 500 (TNTC-5) and 700 degrees C (TNTC-7) and for Ti. The TNTC-5 (constituted by anatase-rutile) which improved its morphology and kept its mechanical strength after annealing, presented the best electrochemical stability after 5 days of exposure. In conclusion, TNTC-5 sample showed to be a good candidate for photocatalysis processes due to: (i) its better ordered 1D nanostructure geometry with longer nanotubes after annealing compared to that of the TNTC-7 sample, which conferred an increase of surface area, (ii) due to short length nanotubes, since better efficient light absorption and fast carrier transport is expected, and thus less unwanted recombination losses, (iii) its chemical structure composition of anatase-rutile in comparison to that at 700 degrees C that transformed completely in rutile, (iv) a clean top surface, (v) the preservation of stable morphology after exposing to corrosive electrolytes in long term showing a high corrosion stability and (vi) its major and stable photocurrent density.

AB The kinetics and mechanism of H-abstraction reaction between CF3CH2OCH2CF3 and Cl atoms are studied in the temperature range of 250-1000 K using CCSD(T)//BHandHLY/6-311 + + G(d, p) method and canonical variational transition state theory (CVT). Two potential pathways are observed for H-abstraction reaction and one of them is the predominant channel over the whole temperature range. IRC calculation reveals an indirect reaction process through the formation of pre- and post-reaction complexes. The calculated rate coefficient k(Cl) = 6.95 x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) is in good agreement with the experimental results. Reaction with Cl atoms may constitute a significant sink in the marine boundary layer.

AB We demonstrate the spatial separation of pyrrole and pyrrole(H2O) clusters from the other atomic and molecular species in a supersonically-expanded beam of pyrrole and traces of water seeded in high-pressure helium gas. The experimental results are quantitatively supported by simulations. The obtained pyrrole(H2O) cluster beam has a purity of similar to 100%. The extracted rotational temperature of pyrrole and pyrrole(H2O) from the original supersonic expansion is T-rot = 0.8 +/- 0.2 K, whereas the temperature of the deflected, pure-pyrrole(H2O) part of the molecular beam corresponds to T-rot approximate to 0.4 K.

TI Pharmacokinetic, biologic and epidemiologic differences in MPA- and

AB Access to safe and effective contraceptive choices is a reproductive right and contributes tremendously to improvements in maternal and child health. Progestin-only injectables, particularly intramuscularly injected depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), have received increased attention given findings suggesting a potential association with increased HIV risk. For women at high risk of HIV, the World Health Organization's Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use currently aggregate recommendations for all progestin-only injectables, including DMPA-IM, subcutaneously injected DMPA (DMPA-SC) and intramuscularly injected norethindrone/norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), except in the case of some drug interactions. We considered whether published data indicate differences or similarities between these injectables relevant to risk of acquiring HIV. In vitro data confirm different biological activities of these distinct progestins, including that MPA, and not NET, binds and activates the glucocorticoid receptor resulting in different biological effects relevant to immune function. Limited clinical data suggest changes in immunologic activity following DMPA-IM and NET-EN initiation, but interstudy variation and study design differences diminish ability to determine clinical relevance and the degree to which DMPA-IM and NET-EN could act differentially. The highest-quality epidemiologic studies suggest a potential 40% increase in HIV incidence in users of DMPA-IM relative to women not using hormonal contraception but no significant increase in risk in users of NET-EN. In our opinion, most of the available biologic activity and epidemiologic data indicate that DMPA and NET-EN are likely to act differently, and data remain too limited to evaluate differences between DMPA-IM and DMPA-SC.

AB Objective: Uptake of permanent contraception among women remains low in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions. We aimed to synthesize available evidence on barriers to, and facilitators of permanent contraception with regards to tubal ligation among women in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Study Design: We reviewed literature on tubal ligation among African women published between January 1, 2000 and October 30, 2017. We searched PubMed, Global health, EMBASE, Web of science, and Google scholar for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies which reported on barriers and/or facilitators to uptake of tubal ligation in sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, we conducted a narrative synthesis and categorized our findings using a framework based on the social ecological model.
   Results: We included 48 articles in the review. Identified barriers to tubal ligation among women included individual-level (myths and misconceptions, fear of surgery, irreversibility of procedure, religious beliefs), interpersonal-level (male partner disapproval), and organizational-level (lack of healthcare worker expertise and equipment) factors. Facilitating factors included achievement of desired family size and perceived effectiveness (individual-level), supportive male partners and knowing other women with permanent contraception experience (interpersonal-level), and finally, subsidized cost of the procedure and task-sharing with lower cadre healthcare workers (organizational-level).
   Conclusions: Barriers to, and facilitators of permanent contraception among women in sub-Saharan Africa are multilevel in nature. Strategies countering these barriers should be prioritized, as effective contraception can promote women's health and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to these strategies, more quantitative research is needed to further understand patient-level factors associated with uptake of permanent contraception among women. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To evaluate outcomes of a national postpartum (within 48 h of delivery) copper intrauterine device placement (PPCuIUD) program in six "high-focus states" with high unmet family planning need in India.
   Study design: We identified high-volume district hospitals that provided PPCuIUD in six (Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh) Indian states (two per state). Each selected hospital maintained a list of PPCuIUD acceptors with contact phone numbers. We randomly selected 100 women at each site for inclusion in a telephone survey of IUD outcomes at 1 year. Questions regarded IUD expulsion, discontinuation because of symptoms (e.g., pain, bleeding, discharge), discontinuation for other reasons and use of alternative contraception if discontinuation reported.
   Results: We could contact 844 of the 1200 randomly selected women, of whom 673 (79.7%) had postplacental insertion (within 10 min of delivery), while 171 (20.3%) had an early postpartum insertion (between 10 min to 48 h after delivery). Of those contacted, 530 women (62.8%) reported continuing with the method beyond 1 year, 63 (7.5%) reported having an expulsion, 163 (19.3%) reported having removals for associated side effects (bleeding, pain and discharge), and 88 (10.4%) reported having removals for other reasons. After removal or expulsion, almost half of the women (46.5%) did not switch to any other modern contraceptive method.
   Conclusion: PPCuIUD continuation rate at 1 year was 62.8%. Most removals within 1 year were due to associated side effects. Almost half of the women discontinuing PPCuIUD did not switch to an alternative modern contraceptive method. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID CONDOM USE; RISK-TAKING; DETERMINANTS; WOMEN; DEBUT
AB Objective: Women's contraceptive use at first sexual intercourse (FSI) may be associated with subsequent sexual behaviors. We examined associations between contraceptive methods used at FSI and subsequent number of life-time partners, induced abortions and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
   Study design: During 2011-2012, we collected questionnaire data from a random sample of women aged 18-45 years from Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We used logistic regression and discrete-time proportional hazards models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing different contraceptive methods used at FSI in the whole study sample and in women with FSI in 2001 or later [when emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) were available without prescription].
   Results: Of 45,361 women in the study sample, those who did not use contraception at FSI (n=8155; 18.0%) were more likely than condom users to have >= 11 lifetime partners (OR=1.34; 95% CI 1.27-1.42), induced abortions (HR=1.62; 95% CI 1.53-1.71) and STIs (HR=1.15; 95% CI 1.10-1.20). ECP users (n= 440, 1.0%) were more likely than condom users to have >= 11 lifetime partners (OR=1.76; 95% CI 1.40-2.22), induced abortions (HR=1.44; 95% CI 1.11-1.86) and STIs (HR=1.84; 95% CI 1.56-2.16). A similar pattern was seen in safe periods/withdrawal users. The associations did not change among women with FSI in 2001 or later (n=14,445).
   Conclusions: Compared with condom use, contraceptive nonuse, safe periods/withdrawal use and ECP use at FSI were associated with subsequent number of sexual partners, induced abortions and STIs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Intrauterine device; Contraceptive implant; Same-day insertion
ID UNITED-STATES; FAILURE
AB Objective: To compare the proportion of women receiving same-day long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) between two different models of contraceptive provision adapted from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project.
   Study Design: We used a controlled time-trend study design to compare 502 women receiving structured contraceptive counseling in addition to usual care ("Enhanced Care") to 506 women receiving counseling plus healthcare provider education and cost support for LARC ("Complete CHOICE") at three federally qualified health centers. We provided funds to health centers to ensure an "on-the-shelf' supply and no-cost LARC for uninsured women. We recorded the contraceptive method chosen after contraceptive counseling and the healthcare provider appointment as well as the contraceptive method received that day. Among women choosing LARC, we calculated proportions and performed Poisson regression with robust error variance to estimate relative risks for same-day insertion.
   Results: Participant demographics reflected the health center populations; 69% were black, 66% had a high school diploma or less, 57% were publicly insured, and 75% reported household income less than 101% federal poverty line. There were 153 (30.5%) women in "Enhanced Care" and 273 (54.0%) in "Complete CHOICE" who chose LARC (p<0.01). Among women who chose LARC (n=426), those in "Complete CHOICE" were more likely to receive a same-day insertion, 53.8% vs. 13.7% (RRadj 4.73; 95%CI 3.20-6.98) compared to "Enhanced Care."
   Conclusions: A contraceptive care model that included healthcare provider education and cost support for LARC in addition to structured contraceptive counseling resulted in higher rates of same-day LARC insertion compared to contraceptive counseling and usual care alone.

TI Shared negative experiences of long-acting reversible contraception and

SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Long-acting reversible contraception; Counseling; Multi-methods;
   Qualitative; Contraceptive decision-making
ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN; WOMEN; COMMUNICATION; ATTITUDES
AB Objectives: We explored how negative stories about long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) - defined as a firsthand negative experience with LARC shared directly with the study participant - were involved in participants' decisions about whether to use LARC following abortion, and how counseling affected the influence of negative LARC stories on contraceptive choices.
   Study design: We performed a multi-methods study, embedded within a trial examining the impact of a theorybased counseling intervention on LARC uptake post-abortion. Participants completed a baseline survey to determine the influence of negative LARC stories. We subsequently invited respondents who reported having heard negative LARC stories to participate in a semi-structured qualitative interview. We analyzed quantitative data with univariate statistics. We analyzed qualitative data using thematic content analysis.
   Results: Among the 60 participants, 16 (27%) reported having heard negative LARC stories. Two of the 16 (13%) planned to initiate LARC prior to counseling, compared to 18 of 44 women (41%) who had not heard negative LARC stories (p=0.06). Prior to counseling, 69% of participants with negative LARC stories reported that these stories made them less likely to use LARC. In qualitative interviews with 9 women, we identified several key themes: (1) negative LARC stories deterred LARC use; (2) friends and family were valued informants; (3) potential side effects were important to LARC decision-making; and (4) positive and negative features of the counseling encounter influenced the effect of negative LARC stories.
   Conclusions: Negative LARC stories are common among women presenting for abortion at our institution and may influence patient uptake of these methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Family planning (FP) clinics are an ideal setting to disseminate information about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), but little is known about women's preferences for learning about PrEP in this setting.
   Study design: We surveyed 500 women seeking care at 4 FP clinics in Atlanta. Before their provider visit, participants completed an HIV-risk screener. After, we asked participants about the HIV prevention counseling they received and how clinics could share information about PrEP. We performed descriptive analyses on demographics, HIV risk, and PrEP awareness/interest, and conducted thematic analysis on open-ended responses.
   Results: Only 18% knew about PrEP before the study; 28% of 376 sexually-active women hathl risk indicator consistent with PrEP eligibility. Three hundred forty seven women (69%) shared suggestions about how clinics should share PrEP information. We categorized suggestions into 4 themes - Advertising, Conversations, Awareness and Access. Participants (n=150) suggested clinics should advertise PrEP via brochures, posters, texts, or emails; 134 wanted providers to talk to patients about PrEP. Several (n=71) suggested sharing PrEP information broadly in the community and with other clinics/providers; others (n=11) wanted improved access to PrEP services.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate overwhelming patient interest in learning more about PrEP through educational materials and directly from FP providers. Women were vocal about increasing PrEP awareness in the community, particularly among populations especially at risk for HIV (e.g., teens). These suggestions can be translated into actionable steps FP clinics can take to increase PrEP awareness and expand their reach to benefit women at risk for HIV. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ID ACCESS; WOMEN
AB Objectives: This study describes hormonal contraception services provided by pharmacists and characterizes patient populations utilizing the service at one supermarket-based pharmacy chain in California and Oregon.
   Study design: This is a descriptive study of 391 pharmacies in California and Oregon within a supermarket-based pharmacy chain providing hormonal contraception services and the patients who utilized those services in a 6.5-month period between August 2016 and February 2017. Data were extracted from pharmacy prescription records and available visit documentation forms to describe services provided and patient characteristics.
   Results: During the study period, 381 trained pharmacists from the pharmacy chain provided hormonal contraception services in 391 pharmacy locations in Oregon and California. A total of 2117 visits were completed and 1970 hormonal contraception prescriptions were issued and dispensed during the study period. Researchers were able to access documentation for 676 visits (32%). Patients from various age groups (range 13-55 years old) and geographical locations (22 states total) utilized the service. Most had health insurance (74%), had seen a primary care provider in the past year (89%) and were previous hormonal contraception users (91%). Contraceptive methods prescribed include pill (n=1886, 95.7%), patch (n=31, 1.6%), vaginal ring (n=51, 2.6%) and injectable (n=2, 0.1%).
   Conclusion: Following scope of practice expansion, pharmacists in a community-based pharmacy setting are serving as an access point for women to obtain hormonal contraception services and supplies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: With the widespread use of sex-steroid hormones in contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, there is an increasing need for reliable analytical methods. We report the development of a sensitive and robust UPLC-MS/MS method for quantitation of both endogenous and synthetic sex-steroid hormones in human serum.
   Study design: We developed and validated a UPLC-MS/MS method to quantify progestogens (etonogestrel, levo-norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone, progesterone) and estrogens (estradiol and ethinyl estradiol) with good accuracy, high sensitivity, and excellent robustness. We then applied the method to the analysis of sex-steroid hormones in serum from 451 clinical research participants.
   Results: Each UPLC-MS/MS analysis was 6.5 min. The lower limits of quantitation (LLOQs) were 25 pg/ml for the progestogens, and 2.5 and 5.0 pg/ml for estradiol and ethinyl estradiol, respectively. When estradiol was analyzed without assessment of progestogens, the LLOQ was reduced to 1 pg/ml. The calibration curves were linear from 25-50,000, 2.5-2000 (1-2000 for estrogens-only analysis) and 5-2000 pg/ml, respectively. Both the accuracy and precision were below +/- 15% not only for routine validation (intraday and interday), but for long-term (>2 years) assay robustness with external controls, thereby, demonstrating the utility of this method for multiyear clinical trial assessments of progestogens and estrogens. We applied the method to quantify sex-steroid levels in 1804 clinical samples.
   Conclusions: We successfully developed a UPLC-MS/MS method, and overcame the matrix suppression to allow sensitive quantitation of both synthetic and endogenous sex-steroid hormones in human serum. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc, All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We explored levonorgestrel (LNG) concentrations, bleeding patterns and endometrial thickness in women with epilepsy (WWE) initiating an LNG-intrauterine device (IUD) co-administered with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
   Study design: This pilot study included 20 WWE ages 18 to 45 years with well-controlled seizures and stable AED regimens initiating a 52-mg LNG-IUD (20 mcg/d initial release). We collected blood and measured endometrial thickness before IUD placement and 21 days, 3 months and 6 months thereafter. Participants recorded bleeding/spotting daily. We measured total LNG (radioimmunoassay), serum hormone binding globulin (SHBG, immunoassay) and calculated the free LNG index. We compared total LNG, free LNG index, SHBG and endometrial thickness over time using a linear mixed-effects model.
   Results: Total LNG, free LNG index and SBHG levels remained stable from day 21 throughout. Endometrial thickness decreased from a median of 5.9 mm [interquartile range (IQR) 4.6-7.5] at day 21 to 3.3mm (2.8-4.9) by month 6 (p=0.02). Bleeding and spotting days decreased from a median of 16 (IQR 13-23) in month 1 to 6.5 (IQR 4-8.5) in month 6 regardless of AED regimen.
   Conclusion: Like women without epilepsy, WWE initiating the LNG-IUD experience stable total LNG concentrations and decreasing endometrial thickness and bleeding over the first 6 months of use. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of levonorgestrel (LNG)-containing combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in obese women.
   Study design: We pooled and reanalyzed data from 89 women with different body mass index (BMI) categories from four clinical studies. The LNG and ethinyl estradiol (EE) PKs were analyzed utilizing a zero-order absorption (K-0), two-compartment PK model to evaluate key PK parameters in relation to a range of weights, BMI and body surface area (BSA).
   Results: Increasing of body habitus metrics is correlated with decreasing C-max (p<.0001) and AUC(T) (p<.05) for both LNG and EE, but no correlation was found for C-min (p >=.17). Increasing weight and BMI were associated with a modest increase (p <=.056) of clearance (CL) and appreciable increases of central volume (V-1 p<.05), distribution clearance (CLd, p <=.001) and peripheral volume (V-2, p<.0001) for LNG. For EE, increases in CL (p <=.009) were found with greater weight, BMI and BSA. Values of V-1, CLd and V-2 also increased (p<.0001) in obese subjects. The half-life and steady-state volume were greater among obese women (p<.0001) for both LNG and EE. LNG and EE PK parameters correlated well (p <=.006 for all), indicating that individual subject physiology affected both drugs similarly.
   Conclusions: The primary effects of obesity on LNG and EE were a modest increase in CL and a marked increase in distribution parameters. We observed no obesity-related differences in trough LNG and EE concentrations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
   Implications: This population PK analysis demonstrated reduced systemic exposure to LNG/EE oral contraceptives in obese subjects (C-max and AUC(T)); these particular differences are unlikely to lower contraceptive effectiveness among obese women who are correctly using LNG-containing contraceptives.

AB The aim of this study is to systematically compare the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and serum cytokines in identifying pediatric cancer patients with high-risk infection. A prospective observational study was performed from January 2014 through December 2016. Consecutive pediatric cancer patients who experienced febrile illness during hospitalization were enrolled. The CRP, PCT, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma were determined within 6 h of fever onset. A total of 3118 episodes of febrile illness were included, with 13.1% episodes documented as bloodstream infection (BSI) and 3.5% diagnosed as septic shock. Patients with BSI presented much higher levels of PCT, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha than patients with other types of fever and have much higher incidence of septic shock (11.2% vs. 2.3%, P < 0.001). IL-6 and IL-10 showed better performance in identifying patients with gram-negative bacteremia (GNB) and septic shock than CRP and PCT, respectively. The area under the curve (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for septic shock prediction were 0.65, 0.78, 0.89 and 0.87 for CRP, PCT, IL-6 and IL-10, respectively. Furthermore, elevation of IL-6 and IL-10 were strongly associated with the development of GNB and septic shock. Our results indicate that BSI, especially GNB, is a high-risk form of infection which results in high incidence of septic shock. IL-6 and IL-10 performance better than CRP and PCT in identifying patients with high-risk febrile illness.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. Several factors contribute to the development of this cancer. Tumor formation in colon triggers immune responses such as immune cells proliferation, phenotype alteration, cytokine synthesis and release, which lead to IL-17 producing T cells, the differentiated CD4 + T cells i.e. T helper 17. IL-17 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which its level is up regulated in serum and tissues of CRC patients. Several studies have shown that IL-17 has an important role in metastasis and prognosis of CRC. The aim of this review is to summarize the role of this cytokine in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis of CRC and discuss its value in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of CRC.

AB Background: S100A11 (calgizzarin), a member of the 5100 family, is associated with oncogenesis, inflammation and myocardial damage. Our aim was to analyse S100A11 in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) and its association with disease activity features and cancer development.
   Methods: S100A11 in muscle was determined by immunohistochemistry in polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), myasthenia gravis (MG) and in subjects without autoimmune inflammatory disease (HC). S100A11 in plasma was measured in 110 patients with IIMs (PM, DM, and cancer associated myositis (CAM) patients) and C-42 HC. Disease activity was assessed by myositis disease activity assessment (MYOACT), muscle enzymes and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by routine laboratory techniques; autoantibodies by immunoprecipitation or by immunoblot.
   Results: We observed an accumulation of S100A11 in the cytoplasm of regenerating and necrotizing muscle fibres of PM and DM patients. S100A11 was increased in plasma of all myositis patients compared to HC (3.8 (1.5-16.8) vs 2.8 (1.7-11.2) ng/ml, p = 0.011) and in DM and CAM patients compared to HC (4.0 (2.2-14.9) and 4.5 (1.5-9.1) vs 2.8 (1.7-11.2) ng/ml, p < 0.001 and p = 0.022, respectively). In all myositis patients, S100A11 correlated with the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.256, p = 0.011), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (r = 0.312, p = 0.002), CRP (r = 0.254, p = 0.022) and MYOACT (r = 0.245, p = 0.022). S100A11 was associated with MYOACT (r = 0.377, p = 0.030) and pulmonary and cutaneous disease activity in DM patients (r = 0.408, p = 0.017 and r = 0.417, p = 0.01, respectively). S100A11 was related to the levels of AST (r = 0.412, p = 0.027) in PM and to the levels of creatine phosphokinase (r = 0.432, p = 0.028) in CAM patients.
   Conclusions: We show for a first time a potential implication of S100A11 in the local inflammatory and tissue remodelling processes in myositis and an association of circulating S100A11 with disease activity and extra muscular manifestations in DM.

AB Background & aims: Biliary atresia (BA) is a neonatal obliterative cholangiopathy with high prevalence in south China. Accurate identification of BA among infants with obstructive jaundice is still difficult by noninvasive diagnostic tools. Th17 cells have been reported closely related with the development of BA, which suggest that Th17-associated cytokines were potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of BA patients.
   Methods: In the training study, 76 infants who were divided into 2 groups, including BA group (n = 31) and non BA jaundice group (n = 45). Clinical and routine laboratory data were collected from all subjects. Totally 25 Th17-associated cytokines were tested and compared between groups. The diagnostic value of each differential cytokine was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The best potential diagnostic biomarker was further validated in a cohort including 68 jaundice infants from our partnering institution in a blinded fashion.
   Results: Data from the training study showed that gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and clay stool would be helpful in the identification of BA patients in jaundice subjects. Th17-associated cytokines assay indicated that IL-17F, IL-10, macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP3a), IL-22, IL-13, IL-33, IL-6, IL-17E, IL-27, IL-31, TNF-a and TNF-b were differentially expressed in BA patients, and the AUC of MIP3a was higher than other markers. MIP3a alone or combined with other laboratory data would significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of BA. The diagnostic value of MIP3a was further confirmed in our validation study.
   Conclusion: MIP3a alone or combined with other laboratory data would significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of BA.

AB Background: The local and systemic immunological profiles of important inflammatory mediators in the localized (LAgP) and generalized (GAgP) forms of aggressive periodontitis are still unknown, as well as the effect of periodontal therapy on these parameters. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate clinical and immune responses of patients with AgP undergoing nonsurgical treatment.
   Material and methods: Eighteen patients with GAgP, 10 with LAgP and 10 healthy participants were included in this study. AgP participants were submitted to scaling and root planing plus systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin and metronidazole). At baseline and 1-year follow-up were measured clinical parameters, such as probing depth [PD] and clinical attachment loss [CAL], and the levels of 10 immunological mediators (GM-CSF, M-CSF, MCP-1, ICAM-1, CXCL8, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-10) in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of selected sites [AgP forms: PD >= 6 mm or the deepest, bleeding on probing (BoP) and bone loss measured by periapical radiography; healthy individuals: PD <= 3 mm, no BoP, no bone loss] and serum.
   Results: After periodontal treatment both forms of AgP presented a significant reduction of PD and CAL, an increase of GM-CSF, ICAM-1, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-10 in the GCF, as well as of GM-CSF and IL-4 in the serum, and a reduction in the serum concentration of IL-1 beta. Serum levels of M-CSF, ICAM-1, and MCP-1 remained significantly below those found in healthy individuals in both forms of AgP even after therapy. An increase in the systemic or local levels of MCP-1, ICAM-1 and the anti-inflammatory profile (IL-4, IL-10) was correlated with an improvement in clinical parameters of LAgP patients. Also, a local reduction of IL-1 beta levels in both forms of AgP was correlated with an increase in the clinical attachment gain.
   Conclusion: Nonsurgical periodontal therapy was successful in improving clinical parameters and modulating the immune response in both forms of AgP. However, this therapeutic approach does not seem to affect the deficient level of important serum mediators involved in mechanisms of cell transmigration.

AB G-CSF is a growth factor widely used to mobilise CD34 + progenitor cells for clinical applications. The present study aimed to assess expression of G-CSF receptor (CSF3R) on neutrophils and monocytes, as well as SDF-1 and G-CSF serum levels in relation to efficacy of G-CSF-induced mobilisation for autologous transplantation. For this purpose, 105 patients with haematological disorders and 46 healthy controls were investigated.
   Before mobilisation patients were characterised with significantly higher percentage of CSF3R expressing neutrophils (p < 0.001) and monocytes (p = 0.002), than controls. G-CSF administration resulted in a decrease of CSF3R + neutrophils (p < 0.001) and monocytes (p < 0.001), while presence of G-CSF receptor on neutrophils tended to negatively affect mobilisation yield (p = 0.075).
   G-CSF concentration increased during mobilisation (p < 0.001). On the 5th day of mobilisation a positive correlation was observed between G-CSF and SDF-1 serum levels (p < 0.001) and the number of CD34 + cells released from bone marrow seemed to be related to both G-CSF (p = 0.036) and SDF-1 levels (p = 0.084).
   As compared to Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, those with multiple myeloma had lower basal percentage of CSF3R + neutrophils (p = 0.014) while Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases exhibited higher G-CSF (p = 0.026) and SDF-1 (p = 0.006) concentration on mobilisation day 5. Hodgkin's lymphoma patients were also characterised with worse mobilisation efficacy than multiple myeloma (p = 0.022) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (p = 0.013) patients.
   These results suggest that both SDF-1 and G-CSF play a role in HSC release into peripheral blood and show that G-CSF administration affects expression of CSF3R on monocytes and neutrophils, implying potential role of these cell subpopulations in mobilisation process.

AB Quercetin is a flavonoid polyphenolic compound present in fruits and vegetables that has proven anti-inflammatory activity. The goal of the present investigation was to investigate the effects of quercetin on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced inflammatory responses via the expression of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19 cells). Real-time PCR, gelatin zymography, and Western blot analysis showed that TNF-alpha induced the expression of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 protein and mRNA in a time-dependent manner. These effects were attenuated by pretreatment of ARPE-19 cells with quercetin. Quercetin inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of PKCS, JNK1/2, ERK1/2. Quercetin, rottlerin, SP600125 and U0126 attenuated TNF-alpha-stimulated c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 Luc activity. Pretreatment with quercetin, rottlerin, SP600125, or Bay 11-7082 attenuated TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B (p65) phosphorylation, translocation and Re1A/p65 Luc activity. TNF-alpha significantly increased MMP-9 promoter activity and THP-1 cell adherence, and these effects were attenuated by pretreatment with quercetin, rottlerin, SP600125, U0126, tanshinone IIA or Bay 117082. These results suggest that quercetin attenuates TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 and MMP-9 expression in ARPE-19 cells via the MEK1/2 ERK1/2 and PKC delta JNK1/2 c-Jun or NF-kappa B pathways.

AB GERD is the most common gastrointestinal diagnosis given during office visit. People who suffer from a long history of GERD eventually develop Barrett's esophagus, a premalignant intestinal metaplasia due to NF kappa B activation. Previous studies focused on the contribution of TNF-triggered canonical NF kappa B pathway to this event. In this study, we demonstrated in vitro that it was LTA, rather than TNF, initiated canonical NF kappa B activation at the beginning of acid/bile attacks, but later it switched to CD40-activated non-canonical pathway, which played a bigger part in esophageal metaplasia. CCN1 attenuated this cellular transformation by suppressing CD40 and its associated proteins involved in non-canonical signaling.

AB Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex eye disease in which decline in autophagy leads to the accumulation of sequestosome 1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62)-labeled waste material inside the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and the condition results in activation of the inflammasome signaling and IL-1 beta secretion. Here, we have studied the role of SQSTM1/p62 in the production of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 in the presence or absence of IL-1 beta. SQSTM1/p62 was either overexpressed or silenced in ARPE-19 cells, which were then exposed to IL-1 beta. Alternatively, bafilomycin A was used to demonstrate the functional decline of autophagy with increased SQSTM1/p62 levels. The protein concentration of SQSTM1/p62 was measured using the western blot technique, and interleukin levels were determined by ELISA. In IL-1 beta-loaded RPE cells, SQSTM1/p62 depletion and overexpression increased the production of MCP-1 and IL-8, respectively. Neither knock-down nor over expression of SQSTM1/p62 induced the release of IL-6. Our data suggest that SQSTM1/p62 is a significant factor in inflammatory responses, especially following the inflammasome activation.

AB Background: The serine/threonine kinase IKBKE is frequently overexpressed or activated in a variety of human cancers. Ectopic expression of IKBKE induces malignant transformation, cell migration, invasion and chemoresistance. Thus, IKBKE is an attractive target for anti-cancer drug development.
   Methods: By screening of NCI Diversity Set and Clinical Collection I and II compound libraries using cell-based assay, we identified several candidates of IKBKE inhibitors, which directly inhibited IKBKE kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. One of them, malachite green oxalate (MCCK1), was further characterized. The mechanism was examined by western blot, immunoprecipitation (IP) and Immunofluorescence. We also evaluated in a mouse xenograft model. In vitro kinase assay and luciferase reporter assay were also performed in our experiments.
   Results: MCCK1 inhibits IKBKE kinase as well as its downstream targets such as IkBa, p65 and IRF3. MCCK1 is a selective inhibitor for IKBKE, with moderate effect on TBK1, but does not inhibit the activation of IKK alpha/beta, STAT3, Erk-1/2, p38 or JNK. The inhibition of IKBKE by MCCK1 resulted in induction of cell growth arrest and apoptosis selectively in human cancer cells that harbor aberrant expression of IKBKE. Furthermore, MCCK1 inhibits tumor growth in nude mice of human cancer cells in which IKBKE is elevated but not of those cancer cells in which it is not.
   Conclusion: These data indicate that MCCK1 is an IKBKE inhibitor with anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo and could be a potential anti-cancer agent for patients with tumors over expressing IKBKE.

AB The C-reactive protein (CRP) is still the conventional marker used to diagnose implant-associated infections (IAI) after orthopaedic surgery. However, the CRP level can lead to misdiagnosis since it is up-regulated not only during bacterial infection. In this prospective study, we evaluated the serum cytokine profile before (pre-OP) and after orthopaedic surgery (post-OP) as well as after confirmation of a developed infection (COI) to identify candidate biomarkers for diagnosis of IAI. Sera from 10 controls 7 to 1 days pre-OP and 0 to 22 days post-OP as well as from 5 patients who developed IAI 5 to 1 days pre-OP, 0 to 197 days post-OP and after COI were analyzed for 27 different cytokines using a multiplex cytokine assay. In addition to CRP, 14 cytokines IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, eotaxin, G-CSF, IFN-gamma, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1 beta were significantly altered (P <= 0.05) during the study although some differences were low-fold elevations compared to the pre-OP levels. IL-6 as well as IL-12(p70) were consistently elevated in infected patients. Surgery influenced cytokine production with some overlap of cytokines in both groups, implying that the use of cytokines is maximized when the cytokines are not or no longer affected by surgical trauma. To lend more robustness to the selection of candidate cytokines, in addition to the statistical differences, we applied a threshold cut-off of approximately 2-fold elevations when comparisons were made. This resulted in the selection of 8 cytokines, namely IL-6, IL-1ra, IL-8, IL-12(p70), eotaxin, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1 beta, which may be used in a multiplex assay for detection of IAI after surgery. Furthermore, IL-1ra and IL-8 may be used as prognostic cytokines prior to surgery. The present results imply that the use of cytokines may be a suitable alternative to CRP for IAI diagnosis.

AB Despite considerable progress in the field of perinatal care, infectious diseases, especially when caused by gram negative bacteria, remain a major reason for neonatal morbidity and mortality. Notably infants born prematurely and those with very low birth weight are at risk due to their immature and deficient immune system and their prolonged hospitalization which promotes nosocomial infections. In case of impending preterm birth, betamethasone is given to induce lung maturation and tocolytic agents like indomethacin or fenoterol are administered to suppress premature labor. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of these drugs on the immune system of mothers and neonates. Therefore, mononuclear cells from cord blood and peripheral maternal blood were stimulated with Escherichia coli and incubated with betamethasone, indomethacin and fenoterol. Subsequently the effect of the treatment on cytokine production was determined. Betamethasone alone and in combination with tocolytic agents inhibited the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Not only does betamethasone dampen the immune response by reducing the production of cytokines, it also has a variety of other detrimental short- and long-term effects on the neonate. In conclusion we would recommend using biological markers to determine if premature labor actually leads to preterm birth and subsequently administer betamethasone only to mothers giving birth prematurely.

AB Inhibition of inflammation is one of the possible therapeutic approaches for Insulin resistance (IR) during type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the current study we investigated the effects of palmitate and chicoric acid (CA) on inflammation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of newly diagnosed T2DM patients and healthy subjects and explored the mechanism by which palmitate and CA influence inflammation.
   20 newly diagnosed T2DM patients and 20 healthy subjects were recruited in our study. Blood sample were collected and PBMCs were isolated. Interleukin 6 (IL6), silent information regulator type 1 (SIRT1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and phospho-AMPK (pAMPK) were evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. PBMCs were treated with palmitate and CA to investigate their effects on inflammation. IL6 and SIRT1 genes expression were evaluated by real-time PCR. The levels of IL6 in culture medium were measured by ELISA. Proteins levels of AMPK and pAMPK in PBMCs were detected by western blotting.
   IL6 expression was higher and SIRT1 expression and pAMPK levels were lower in PBMCs of diabetic patients and obese subjects compared to healthy subjects and non-obese subjects, respectively. CA significantly prevented against increased IL6 levels as well as its gene expression in PBMCs induced by palmitate. Also, CA returned reduction in SIRT1 expression and pAMPK levels mediated via palmitate to near control level.
   These findings reveal that CA reduces inflammation in PBMCs probably through upregulation of SIRT1 and pAMPK. Therefore, CA would be suggested as a novel agent for the treatment of T2DM.

AB Homozygous mutations in Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 gene (TREM2) are one of the major causes of Nasu Hakola Disease (NHD). We analysed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) profile of 164 inflammatory factors in patients with NHD carrying the TREM2 Q33X mutation as compared with heterozygous and wild type individuals.
   Several molecules related to bone formation and angiogenesis were altered in NHD compared to non-carriers: Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)-1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in PBMC (2.32 fold-increase; P = 0.01), as were Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFB)3 levels (1.51 fold-increase; P = 0.02). Conversely, CXCL5 and Pro Platelet Basic Protein (PPBP) were strongly downregulated (-28.26, -9.85 fold-decrease over non-carriers, respectively, P = 0.01), as well as Platelet Factor 4 Variant 1 (PF4V1; -41.44, P = 0.03).
   Among other inflammatory factors evaluated, Interleukin (IL)-15 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Superfamily Member (TNFSF)4 mRNA levels were decreased in NHD as compared with non-carriers (-2.25 and -3.87 fold decrease, P = 0.01 and 0.001, respectively).
   In heterozygous individuals, no significant differences were observed, apart from IL-15 mRNA levels, that were decreased at the same extent as NHD (-2.05 fold-decrease over non-carriers, P = 0.002).
   We identified a signature in PBMC from patients with NHD consisting of strongly decreased mRNA levels of CXCL5, PPBP, PF4V1, mildly decreased IL-15 and TNFSF4 and mildly increased BMP-1 and TGFB3.

AB Pyrogens, the fever inducing substances accidently enter into a human body through contamination from medical or pharmaceutical products may create mild to severe complications including septicaemia and shocking syndromes. To avoid such drastic situations all the pharmaceuticals and medical devices are analysed for presence of pyrogens prior to their release into market. The entry of exogenous pyrogens like bacterial endotoxins induces the release of endogenous pyrogens or inflammatory cytokines that activate immune system to defend against these pathogens. Generation of heat is considered as one of the important defence mechanism of body achieved through receptor mediated interaction of endogenous pyrogens at the thermoregulatory centre of hypothalamus. However, uncontrolled fever and febrile reaction may cause lethal effects to the subject itself. So a well sophistically functioning antipyretic mechanism is necessary to achieve thermoregulation. The coordinated interaction of antipyretic cytokines and other mediators are active in human immune system which play a crucial role in maintaining thermal homeostasis. The multiple interacting antipyretic signals and their mechanism are the major subjects of this review.

AB Autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) is a chronic autoimmune thyroiditis with a complex pathogenesis including environmental factors, genetic background and immune system actions. Despite the large-scale research and discovery of new subpopulations of lymphocytes, cytokines, chemokines and their functions in the human body, the ethiology of ATD in many aspects remains a mystery. This article tries to summarize mostly the immunological aspects of this disease, including the roles of different cells types (dendritic cells, B cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, NK cells and regulatory T cells) and of different cytokines (secreted by Th1/Th2/Th17/Th22 lymphocyte subpopulations and other, including the IL-23 and CXCL10). We describe the role of immunological abnormalities in the ATD pathogenesis and show that for some cells and cytokines their respective roles are not clear, and bi-directional action is possible. Finally, we propose a network of interactions between the immune cells and thyrocytes in the course of ATD.

AB Background and aim: Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature in hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Whether blood pressure (BP) variability is influencing serum intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) remains to be clarified. We aimed to assess the association between the circulating adhesion molecules and ambulatory blood pressure variability in patients with type 2 diabetes and controls.
   Patients and methods: The study included data from type 2 diabetes with controlled BP (n = 55), type 2 diabetes with uncontrolled BP (n = 55) and control subjects (n = 28). ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were measured with specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. BP variability was assessed using standard deviation of mean systolic and diastolic BP evaluated during 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring.
   Results: The uncontrolled BP type 2 diabetes group had significantly higher serum ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels compared to controlled BP type 2 diabetes and control groups. In linear regression analysis, after adjustment, higher ICAM-1 was consistently associated with higher daytime and 24-hour diastolic BP variability, and daytime systolic BP variability in the study population. VCAM-1 was associated only with daytime systolic BP variability.
   Conclusions: Our study evaluating the association of serum ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 with 24-hour ambulatory BP variability in patients with type 2 diabetes and controls might offer better understanding of the mechanisms generating endothelial dysfunction. Elevated 24-hour ambulatory BP variability might induce endothelial activation by increasing circulating adhesion molecules levels.

AB Background: Adiponectin is a hormone that together with its receptors modulates a number of metabolic processes including gluconeogenesis and lipid catabolism. It belongs to the C1QTNF (complement Clq tumor necrosis factor-related protein) family, which has a variety of members with high amino acid sequence homology and overlapping functions. Concentration of adiponectin in blood is inversely correlated with body fat percentage and cardiac risk factors like blood pressure and CRP (C-reactive protein) level. Studies have identified the existence of a cardiac adiponectin system. However, little is known about the role of this system in the pathogenesis of autoimmune myocarditis. Thus, we have studied the involvement of adiponectin in the development of this autoimmune disorder in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM).
   Methods: Adiponectin knockout (ko) and wild type (wt) mice were immunized with cardiac troponin I (cTnl) to induce an EAM. To determine the severity of myocardial damage, inflammation and fibrosis were scored after HE and Afog staining and high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) level was measured. To detect if changes in specific inflammatory cell numbers could be observed between the genotypes, we performed immunohistochemical staining to detect T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages. The level of the humoral immune response was determined through the measurement of cTnl-specific serum IgG autoantibodies. Relative mRNA expression of different cytokines, C1QTNF family members and adiponectin receptors in the heart tissue was analyzed with qPCR.
   Results: Animals immunized with cTnl developed autoimmune myocarditis with a significant deterioration of cardiac parameters compared to the corresponding control group. The adiponectin ko group immunized with cTnl showed a tendency towards increased inflammation, fibrosis, heart-to-body-weight ratio, infiltration pattern of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages, hsTnT concentration, humoral immune response and mRNA expression of interleukin 6 in the heart tissue and decreased weight gain compared to the wt group immunized with cTnl. However, the difference to the wt group treated with cTnl was not significant. The analysis of cardiac mRNA expression of adiponectin receptors and four C1QTNF family members, most suitable for fulfilling the functions of adiponectin in adiponectin ko mice, did not show any significant differences between adiponectin ko and wt group at all.
   Conclusion: Our study reveals that the absence of adiponectin did not lead to a significantly increased impairment of cardiac function and was also unlikely to be compensated by its receptors or other C1QTNF family members in the murine model of EAM. Here, other synergistic or redundant effects might play a role and must be investigated in further studies to understand the role and function of adiponectin in autoimmune myocarditis.

AB Background: Significant differences are mentioned in the progress of calcification between aortic and mitral valve. Evidence of inflammation in calcific aortic and mitral valve disease suggests that pathways of Toll Like Receptors (TLR) and Interleukin (IL)-37 expression may contribute to this process. We sought to investigate the role of TLR-mediated inflammatory response and IL-37 pathway expression on aortic and mitral valve calcification.
   Material and methods: One-hundred twenty stenotic valve cusps/leaflets (60 aortic, 60 mitral) were excised during surgery and were collected for histological, immunohistochemistry and morphometric analysis at our department. After total RNA isolation from a second part of valve cusps/leaflets, cDNA synthesis and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) protocols were performed and relative mRNA levels of target genes were assessed.
   Results: By histological analysis, the anti-inflammatory IL-37 levels were increased in mitral valve leaflets (MVL) compared to aortic valve cusps (AVCu) while all other biomarkers, including TLR, presented a reverse pattern with decreased levels as compared to AVCu. In terms of calcification biomarkers, only osteopontin differed between AVCu and MVL. mRNA analysis confirmed increased expression of IL-37 and decreased levels of TLR in MVL compared to AVCu.
   Conclusions: Stenotic cusps of aortic valves express lower IL-37 and increased TLRs levels than stenotic mitral valve leaflets, suggesting a differential pro-calcification and pro-inflammatory profile between the two valves. This may explain the higher incidence of calcification of AVCu than MVL and offer therapeutic considerations.

AB The gamma c family of cytokines comprising interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-2 is an important group of 4-helix bundle cytokines that signals through receptors incorporating the common gamma chain (gamma c). These cytokines are involved in lymphocyte biology and their specific functions are contingent on binding to cognate receptor chains. Here, we examined the structural relationships between gamma c cytokines, aiming to understand the basis for receptor chain usage and sharing. To that end, we obtained tertiary structures of human and mouse gamma c cytokines plus two other related cytokines, IL-13 and TSLP, which share receptors with IL-4 and IL-7, respectively. Subsequently, we compared the cytokine 3D-structures introducing a structural similarity score that grouped gamma c cytokines in a manner that mirrored the relationships dictated by receptor sharing. Unlike previously thought, we identified that IL-9 is more closely related to IL-2 and IL-15 than to IL-7, which is actually the most distant member of the gamma c family of cytokines. Moreover, we found that all the members of the gamma c family of cytokines share the topology of short-chain 4-helix bundle cytokines but IL-7 that with TSLP has the topology of long-chain 4-helix bundle cytokines. We also carried out Maximun-Likehood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses that supported these results at the amino acid sequence level. Overall, our findings are of paramount relevance to understand receptor sharing among gamma c cytokines and can lead to the discovery of new cytokine receptor partners.

AB Herein, we report a unique design of heterogeneous catalyst via post synthetic modification on Zirconium based MOF, UiO-66 with Ag2WO4, decorated with silver nanoparticles. The as synthesized materials were characterized by different characterization techniques. The photoresponsive behavior was evaluated by photodegradation of azo and non-azo dyes, under visible light. Enhanced activity was attributed to synergistic effect of the heterojunction and the surface plasmonic effect of silver nanoparticles. The thermally stable Photocatalyst was found to retain 80% efficiency after five cycles. This work illustrates the potential of combining MOFs with semiconductors in developing highly active heterogeneous catalysts for solar energy utilization.

AB The spin- and deformation-dependent electron structures of the single-walled chiral and achiral N nanotubes are investigated using a relativistic linear augmented cylindrical wave method. It is shown that the Fermi level separates the valence and conduction band curves. The nanotubes are semimetallic. The spin-orbit coupling results in a splitting of dispersion curves equal up to 0.5 eV. The torsional, uniaxial, and uniform strain results in a drastic change of the electronic states at the Fermi level. The mechanical deformation of some N nanotubes can induce a formation minigaps in a terahertz region that can be used in electronic devices.

Temperatures ranged from 297 to 570 K at nominal pressures of 2, 5, and 10 bar (bath gas: helium). The very weak temperature dependence of the obtained rate coefficient can be expressed as: k(1)(T) = (2.9 +/- 0.5) x 10(-12) exp[(126 +/- 61)/T] cm(3) s(-1). A significant pressure dependence was not observed. The results are in very good agreement with literature data for temperatures up to 370 K whereas differences occur at T > 400 K.

The reaction trends of these short chain aliphatic ethers with the different oxidants have been discussed. From the obtained results, the reaction with OH is the main tropospheric loss process for MnBE and MsBE, with lifetimes of 19.2 h and 26.8 h, respectively. These short lifetimes indicate that the chemistry of these aliphatic ethers is important in areas close to their emission sources.

Except for [Ag-24(trz)(18)](6+) the nanocages at triplet state present lowest energy than singlet state. The large energy gap (3.75 eV) implies the higher chemical stability of [Ag-24(trz)(18)](4+ )(triplet state) and [Ag-24(trz)(18)](6+) (singlet state). The nanocages with oxidation state of 0 and +2 at triplet state can act as conductors with energy gap below 1 eV. The results herein show that the new nanoclusters predicted may be used as sensors, as conductors, to encapsulate chemical species and in chemical reactions.

AB Lithiation of M-C2H2 results significant enhancement of second-hyperpolarizability. The negatively polarized pi-surface of C2Li2 raises the molecular orbital energies which strongly favours both metal-HOMO to ligand-LUMO and ligand-HOMO to metal-LUMO charge transfer interactions. Due to the push electron effect by C2Li2 , the outermost 'ns' orbital of alkaline earth metal cannot induce charge transfer instead forms the excess diffuse electron density localized over the alkaline earth metal. Calculated vertical ionization energy of M-C2Li2 complexes are smaller than the corresponding isolated metals. CCSD calculated static and dynamic second-hyperpolarizabilities of M-C2Li2 complexes are many times larger than that of the corresponding M-C2H2 complexes.

AB A green and efficient solid acid catalyst was developed for direct conversion of Jatropha oil into biodiesel over Ni modified phosphomolybdic acid (HPMo)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a fixed-bed reactor. Under optimal conditions (Temperature = 330 degrees C, Pressure = 3 MPa, H-2/oil (v/v) = 800 N m(3) m(-3), Liquid hourly space velocity = 1 h(-1) ), the yield of biodiesel (C15-C18 alkanes) was 86.7 wt%, and the conversion was 98.2%. The conversion was 86.1% during five runs of recycling. Comparing with the thermal cracking process, the catalytic cracking exhibited the same performance at a lower temperature. A possible reaction pathway to the reaction was suggested.

HOMA (as structural criterion), NICS (FIPC-NICS, isotropic and ZZ employed as magnetic criteria) as well as the indexes ASE, MCI, PDI and FLU, interestingly provided controversial data respect to the magnetically induced current density plots and chemical intuition, which is extensively discussed in the herein work. Furthermore, EDA-NOCV was used to complement the rational explanation of the observed results.

AB Density functional theory, including the van der Waals interaction, has been used to study the interaction between some small molecules with lone pairs and the V2O5 (0 0 1) surface. Results reveal that the naked vanadium atom is the most important centre of attraction to the hazardous molecules considered in the present work, regardless of the vdW functional employed. The contour plot of each charge density difference shows an increase of charge density in the Ione pair close to the surface. The attractive interaction between each adsorbed molecule and the surface proves to be weak, with a strong role of the vdW interaction.

The effectiveness of the model was validated by verifying the influence of the primary synthetic index, i.e., the molar ratio, on the physical and thermal properties (i.e., density and glass transition temperature) of Resol resins. This model can aid in developing more efficient and suitable synthetic conditions to obtain products exhibiting the desired material properties.

AB Colle-Salvetti type energy functionals for dynamical correlation are constructed for two-dimensional quantum systems. These correlation functionals depend on the 2D-Becke88 exchange energy functional and contain a progressive part which can be updated by taking a perfect approximation of the pair density and redefining the adjustable parameters. Assessment of these proposed functionals is endorsed through parabolic quantum dot systems. The exact correlation energies along with self-consistent results corresponding to two existing correlation functionals are calculated for comparison. The calculated correlation energies for the considered quantum dot systems agree well with the reference results having the minimum error among all considered functionals.

AB First principles studies on the electronic structure, stability, and magnetic properties of CrnTem (1 <= n <= 6, 1 <= m <= 8) clusters have been carried out within a density functional framework. Investigations into the energetic stability indicate that Cr4Te6 and Cr6Te8 are energetically stable species. The Cr4Te6 cluster is found to be nonmagnetic and to have a large HOMO-LUMO gap. Energetic and electronic stability are not always correlated as Cr6Te8 is marked by a much smaller HOMO-LUMO gap, is magnetic, and has a high electron affinity of 3.39 eV. The stability of Cr6Te8 is enhanced by adding charge donating ligands to form stable Cr6Te8(PEt3)(6) clusters.

AB The kinetic chemistry of H-abstraction reactions of isobutene by the OH radical and the channels of the C4H9O complex formed by addition of the hydroxyl to isobutene were investigated in current work. Their rate constants at high pressure limits were computed based on the canonical transition state theory with tunneling effect considered, following the construction of the potential energy surface (PES) based on a duel-level quantum chemistry method at CCSD(T)/CBS//BHandHLYP/6-311G(d,p) level. Comparison of reaction rate constants of H-abstractions by the OH radical for isobutene with previous experimental and calculated data showed acceptable agreements. Isomerization pathways of the hydroxybutyl radicals to each other and to the isobutoxy radical were discussed in details. It was observed that the rate constants for both H-abstraction and isomerization via Htransfer were improved by considering tunneling effect. Subsequently, the pressure-dependent rate constants of multiple channels for each hydroxybutyl radical and of the dominant channel for isobutoxy radical were calculated based on RRKM/ME theory. The effect of chemical activation and thermal initial distribution was discussed with the case of 2-hydroxymethyl-prop-2-yl (W1) radical.

AB Partitioning of helium atom's correlation energy into radial and angular contributions, although of fundamental interest, has eluded critical scrutiny. Conventionally, radial and angular correlation energies of helium atom are defined for its ground state as deviations, from Hartree-Fock and exact values, of the energy obtained using a purely radial wavefunction devoid of any explicit dependence on the interelectronic distance. Here, we show this rationale to associate the contribution from radial-angular coupling entirely to the angular part underestimating the radial one, thereby also incorrectly predict non-vanishing residual radial probability densities. We derive analytic matrix elements for the high-precision Hylleraas basis set framework to seamlessly uncouple the angular correlation energy from its radial counterpart. The resulting formula agrees with numerical cubature yielding precise purely angular correlation energies for the ground as well as excited states. Our calculations indicate 60.2% of helium's correlation energy to arise from strictly radial interactions; when excluding the contribution from the radial-angular coupling, this value drops to 41.3%.

Sample fired at 730 degrees C with Li/M = 1.03 provided the best structural and electrochemical performance. The optimized sample delivered 220 mAh g(-1) discharge capacity at 0.1 C, and 92.5% capacity retention after 50 cycles at 1 C along with better rate capability (192 mAh g(-1) discharge capacity at 2 C). Such excellent performance is possibly attributed to the uniform clean spherical particles and well-developed layered structure with low cation mixing.

AB Constrained molecular dynamics simulations are used to compute the potentials of mean force (PMFs) of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIM+ - Cl-) ion pair in water-ethanol mixtures. From the PMFs of BMIM+ - Cl- ion pair, we notice that, as the mole fraction of ethanol increases, the depths of the minima of the contact ion pair (CIP) and solvent assisted ion pair (SAIP) increase. The CIPs and SAIPs are stabilized by entropy in all the mixtures. As the mole fraction of ethanol changes from 1.0 to 0.8, the stabilities of CIPs and SAIPs are reduced significantly due to large enhancement in the local densities of water.
