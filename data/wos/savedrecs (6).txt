AB This contribution proves that neutral re-balancing mechanisms, that do not alter the likelihood ratio, and training discriminative machines using Bregman divergences as surrogate costs are necessary and sufficient conditions to estimate the likelihood ratio of imbalanced binary classification problems in a consistent manner. These two conditions permit the estimation of the theoretical Neyman-Pearson operating characteristic corresponding to the problem under study. In practice, a classifier operates at a certain working point corresponding to, for example, a given false positive rate. This perspective allows the introduction of an additional principled procedure to improve classification performance by means of a second design step in which more weight is assigned to the appropriate training samples. The paper includes a number of examples that demonstrate the performance capabilities of the methods presented, and concludes with a discussion of relevant research directions and open problems in the area.

AB This study aims to propose (i) a multi-view text classification method and (ii) a ranking method that allows for selecting the best information fusion layer among many variations. Multi-view document classification is worth a detailed study as it makes it possible to combine different feature sets into yet another view that further improves text classification. For this purpose, we propose a multi-view framework for text classification that is composed of two levels of information fusion. At the first level, classifiers are constructed using different data views, i.e. different vector space models by various machine learning algorithms. At the second level, the information fusion layer uses input information using a features projection method and a meta-classifier modelled by a selected machine learning algorithm. A final decision based on classification results produced by the models positioned at the first layer is reached. Moreover, we propose a ranking method to assess various configurations of the fusion layer. We use heuristics that utilise statistical properties of F-score values calculated for classification results produced at the fusion layer. The information fusion layer of the classification framework and ranking method has been empirically evaluated. For this purpose, we introduce a use case checking whether companies' domains identify their innovativeness. The results empirically demonstrate that the information fusion layer enhances classification quality. The Friedman's aligned rank and Wilcoxon signed-rank statistical tests and the effect size support this hypothesis. In addition, the Spearman statistical test carried out for the obtained results demonstrated that the assessment made by the proposed ranking method converges to a well-established method named Hellinger - The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (H-TOPSIS). Thus, the proposed approach may be used for the assessment of classifier performance. (C) 2019 National Information Processing Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We propose in this paper a novel trend based SAX reduction technique called SAX_CP, which captures the trends in a time series based on abrupt change points and on data variation. SAX_CP discriminates between time series by adopting a variable segment size that depends on the time series' change points. Furthermore, SAX_CP is endowed with a new distance that takes into account the possible correlations between time series. The proposed distance enjoys interesting features such as lower bounding the Euclidean distance and better Tightness of Lower Bound (TLB) compared to the so far published SAX based distances. We conduct comprehensive experiments on classification based on SAX_CP and other related SAX based reduction techniques. The results show that SAX_CP enjoys better classification results compared to these techniques with a small reduction cost. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Convolutional neural network; IBS theory; Liver fibrosis; Cross-contrast

AB In this paper we proposes a cross-contrast neural network (CCNN) for liver fibrosis classification. This method consists of two main parts. The first part extracts feature and gets the cross probability maps for utilizing the implicit contrast information among the inputs. The second part measures the similarity between two maps using the modified information based similarity (IBS) theory. IBS theory is a statistical method quantifies similarity between symbols and have been proved valid in many areas (Yang, Hseu, Yien, Goldberger, & Peng, 2003), but it has not been combined with neural network so far. CCNN combines the advantages of statistical analysis and convolutional neural networks, fitting the problem that the number of medical images is relatively small for traditional deep neural network to train. We apply CCNN on a 34-person dataset (23/11 for train/test) and the experimental results (shown in Table 3) clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the method. The highest accuracy is achieved on binary classification of F3 vs. F4, F0 vs.F3 and F1 vs. F3, which are 98.33%. The accuracy of no-to-moderate fibrosis (F0-2) vs. advanced fibrosis (F3-4) and 5 categories is 93.33% and 71.11% relatively. We find that most classification error occurs with F2. After removing F2, the classification accuracy of 4 categories rises to 84.44%. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hybrid metaheuristics have proven to be effective at solving complex real-world problems. However, designing hybrid metaheuristics is extremely time consuming and requires expert knowledge of the different metaheuristics that are hybridized. In previous work, the effectiveness of automating the design of relay hybrid metaheuristics has been established. A genetic algorithm was used to determine the sequence of hybridized metaheuristics and the parameters of the metaheuristics in the hybrid. This study extends this idea by automating the design of each metaheuristic involved in the hybridization in addition to automating the design of the hybridization. A template is specified for each metaheuristic, defining the metaheuristic in terms of components. Manual design of metaheuristics usually involves determining the components of the metaheuristic. In this study, a genetic algorithm is employed to determine the components and parameters for each metaheuristic as well as the sequence of hybridized metaheuristics. The proposed genetic algorithm approach was evaluated by using it to automatically design hybrid metaheuristics for two problem domains, namely, the aircraft landing problem and the two-dimensional bin packing problem. The automatically designed hybrid metaheuristics were found to perform competitively to state-of-the-art hybridized metaheuristics for both problems. Future research will extend these ideas by looking at automating the derivation of metaheuristic algorithms without predefined structures specified by the templates. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study extends a recurrent reinforcement portfolio allocation and rebalancing management system with complex portfolio constraints using particle swarm algorithms. In particular, we propose to use a combination of recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) and particle swarm algorithm (PSO) with Calmar ratio for both asset allocation and constraint optimization. Using S&P100 index stocks, we show such a system with a Calmar ratio based objective function yields a better efficient frontier than the Sharpe ratio and mean-variance based portfolios. By comparing with multiple PSO based long only constrained portfolios, we propose an optimal portfolio trading system that is capable of generating both long and short signals and handling the common portfolio constraints. We further develop an adaptive RRL-PSO portfolio rebalancing decision system with a market condition stop-loss retraining mechanism, and we show that the proposed portfolio trading system outperforms the benchmarks consistently especially under high transaction cost conditions.

AB Computerized clinical decision support systems can help to provide objective, standardized, and timely dementia diagnosis. However, current computerized systems are mainly based on group analysis, discrete classification of disease stages, or expensive and not readily accessible biomarkers, while current clinical practice relies relatively heavily on cognitive and functional assessments (CFA). In this study, we developed a computational framework using a suite of machine learning tools for identifying key markers in predicting the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a large set of biological and clinical measures. Six machine learning approaches, namely Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Support Vector Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor for regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbor for classification, were used for the development of predictive models. We demonstrated high predictive power of CFA. Predictive performance of models incorporating CFA was shown to consistently have higher accuracy than those based solely on biomarker modalities. We found that KRR and SVM were the best performing regression and classification methods respectively. The optimal SVM performance was observed for a set of four CFA test scores (FAQ ADAS13, MoCA, MMSE) with multi-class classification accuracy of 83.0%, 95%CI = (72.1%, 93.8%) while the best performance of the KRR model was reported with combined CFA and MRI neuroimaging data, i.e., R-2=0.874, 95%CI = (0.827, 0.922). Given the high predictive power of CFA and their widespread use in clinical practice, we designed a data-driven and self-adaptive computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) prototype for evaluating the severity of AD of an individual on a continuous spectrum. The system implemented an automated computational approach for data pre-processing, modelling, and validation and used exclusively the scores of selected cognitive measures as data entries. Taken together, we have developed an objective and practical CDSS to aid AD diagnosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work introduces and formalizes the Flying Tourist Problem (FTP), whose goal is to find the best schedule, route, and set of flights for any given unconstrained multi-city flight request. To solve the FTP, the developed work proposes a methodology that allows an efficient resolution of this rather demanding problem. This strategy uses different heuristics and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, allowing the identification of solutions in real-time, even for large problem instances. The implemented system was evaluated using different criteria, including the provided gains (in terms of total flight price and duration) and its performance compared to other similar systems. The obtained results show that the developed optimization system consistently presents solutions that are up to 35% cheaper (or 60% faster) than those developed by simpler heuristics.

AB Diabetes mellitus is a major non-communicable disease ever rising as an epidemic and a public health crisis worldwide. One of the several life-threatening complications of diabetes is hypertension or high blood pressure which mostly remains undiagnosed and untreated until symptoms become severe. Diabetic complications can be greatly reduced or prevented by early detection of individuals at risk. In recent past, several machine learning classification algorithms have been widely applied for diagnosing diabetes but very few studies have been conducted for detecting hypertension among diabetic subjects. Specifically, existing rule-based models fail to produce comprehensible rule sets. To resolve this limitation, this paper endeavours to develop a hybrid approach for extracting rules from support vector machines. A feature selection mechanism is introduced for selecting significantly associated features from the dataset. XGBoost has been utilized to convert SVM black box model into an apprehensible decision-making tool. A new dataset has been obtained from Pt. JNM, Medical College, Raipur, India comprising of 300 diabetic subjects with 108 hypertensives and 192 normotensives. In addition, five public diabetes-related datasets have been taken for generalization of the results. Experiments reveal that the proposed model outperforms ten other benchmark classifiers. Friedman rank and post hoc Bonferroni-Dunn tests demonstrate the significance of the proposed method over others. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Unified Modelling Language (UML) class model is an essential constituent in the software system development process and a considerable body of knowledge is encompassed in the form of class model designs. A UML class model forms an elaborate specification hierarchy and comparing different class models in order to identify corresponding parts assumes considerable human expertise. To imitate such human capacity an exponentially complex task needs to be addressed. Yet, the research that involves UML class model matching focuses primarily only on a design pattern detection and studies that tackle the problem of matching any class models are rather rare. The aim of this study is to introduce a class model distance computation framework that can be utilised for comparing class models in model repositories. The framework exploits the relational structure between model elements as well as internal element features to devise a distance measure between any pair of class models. The relational structures of two class models in the form of graphs are aligned using the graph edit distance technique. The internal element feature distance computation deploys the Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment of any two-feature sets. The distance computation framework reduces the comparison task to polynomial time complexity. The study presents experimental performance analysis of the proposed framework conducted using the precision-recall and receiver operating characteristics curves and corresponding areas under the curves. The results of the analysis indicate low false positive rates for both pairwise and pattern detection tasks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fuzzy regression analysis was extensively used in previous studies to model the relationships between dependent and independent variables in a fuzzy environment. Various approaches have been proposed to perform fuzzy regression analysis with most of the approaches adopting a single objective function in the generation of fuzzy regression models. Some previous studies attempted to generate fuzzy regression models using a multi-objective optimization approach in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the generated fuzzy regression models. However, in the studies, the subjective judgments of parameter settings are required for solving multi-objective optimization problems and a complete representation of Parato optimal solutions cannot be generated in a single run. To address the limitations, a multi-objective evolutionary approach to fuzzy regression analysis is proposed in this paper. In the proposed approach, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated which involves three objectives; minimizing the fuzziness of fuzzy outputs, minimizing the effect of outliers and minimizing the mean absolute percentage error of modeling. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-alpha is introduced to solve the problem and generate a set of Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution is applied to determine a final optimal solution by which a fuzzy regression model can be generated. A case study is conducted to illustrate the proposed approach. Sixteen validation tests are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results of the validation tests show that the proposed approach outperforms Tanaka's fuzzy regression, Peters' fuzzy regression, compromise programming based multi-objective fuzzy regression, fuzzy least-squares regression and probabilistic fuzzy regression approaches in terms of training errors and prediction accuracy.

AB Subsethood and similarity between fuzzy sets have always been intensely studied concepts in fuzzy set theory (FST). However, researches on subsethood and similarity for truly general type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs) have been comparatively scarce, because of the intrinsic difficulties of directly dealing with the secondary membership functions of very general nature. While the advent of the alpha-planeiz-slice representation by Mendel and his colleagues as well as by Wagner and Hagras has led to progress in confronting this challenge, there remains quite a number of limitations and unsolved issues. The contribution of this article is to utilize a generalized foundational model (introduced in Ngan, 2018) to construct T2FS subsethood and similarity measures as rationally, concretely and systematically as feasible, such that (i) these T2FS measures are applicable to truly general type-2 fuzzy sets, that (ii) the actions of these measures can be very simply understood, analyzed and even customized by the T2FS users, and that (iii) these T2FS measures can process and output results that appropriately maintain and reflect the high degree of fuzziness involved in T2FSs. Last but not least, for applications, (iv) these measures will be demonstrated on multiple criteria decision making and pattern recognition problems, and (v) in a brief sketch, we will illustrate how the generalized-foundational-model-based method of building T2FS subsethood and similarity measures can be adapted to building other T2FS measures that embrace the advantages described in (i), (ii) and (iii).

AB Lane changing behavior generally expresses uncertainty due to the impact of environmental factors, and unreasonable lane changes can cause serious collisions. High precision prediction of lane changing intent is helpful to enhance proactivity in driving safety protection. This study proposed a lane-changing prediction model based on Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm and adaptive Neural Network (FCMNN), which introduced a new prediction process: (1) Unsupervised learning method: categorize original dataset into different clusters according to their distribution features; (2) Supervised learning method: optimize sub Neural Network structures and weighting parameters for each cluster or pattern. Through comparing with several traditional methods under different simulation scenarios, the proposed model effectively improve the prediction performance and stability. The results obtained in this study will be helpful to deeply analyze the intent recognition of driving behavior, improve the safety of lane-changing behavior, and provide key technology in driving prediction of Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS).

AB In expert systems, complex optimization problems are always characterized by nonlinearity, nonconvexity, multi-modality, discontinuity, and high dimensionality. Although classical optimization algorithms are mature, they readily fall into a local optimum. The differential evolution (DE) algorithm has been successfully applied to solve numerous problems with expert systems. However, balancing the global and local search capabilities of the DE algorithm remains an open issue and has attracted significant research attention. Thus, a hierarchical heterogeneous DE algorithm that incorporates multi-cross operation (MCO) is proposed in this article. In the proposed algorithm, success-history-based adaptive DE (SHADE) is implemented in the bottom layer, while MCO is implemented in the top layer. The MCO search is based on the SHADE results, but its search results do not affect the bottom layer. First-order stability analyses conducted for the presented MCO showed that the individual positions are expected to converge at a fixed point in the search space. The accuracy and convergence speed of the proposed algorithm were also experimentally compared with those of eight other advanced particle swarm optimization techniques and DE variants using benchmark functions from CEC2017. The proposed algorithm yielded better solution accuracy for 30- and 50-dimensional problems than the other variants, and although it did not provide the fastest convergence for all of the functions, it ranked among the top three for the unimodal and simple multimodal functions and achieved fast convergence for the other functions.

AB The National Hockey League (NHL) is a major North American sports organization that earns $3.3 billion in annual revenue, and its stakeholders-team management, advertisers, sports analysts, fans, among others-have vested interest in league competitiveness and team performance. Utilizing player and team data collected from various web sources, we propose an expert system to better predict NHL game outcomes as well as improve recruiting and salary decisions. The system combines principal components analysis, nonparametric statistical analysis, a support vector machine (SVM), and an ensemble machine learning algorithm to predict whether a hockey team will win a game. The ensemble methods improve upon the reference SVM classifier, and the ensemble models' predictive accuracy for the testing set exceeds 90%. The comparison of several ensemble machine learning approaches specifies opportunities to improve the accuracy of game outcome prediction. The system makes it simple for users to employ the learning methodologies and input data sources, evaluate model results, and address the challenges and concerns inherent in predicting hockey game wins.

AB In this paper, we propose an efficient time-space-domain optimized (OptTS) finite difference scheme to model 2D and 3D scalar wave propagation. It adopts piecewise constant interpolation coefficients for several consecutive Courant number ranges, which avoids the extra time costs caused by loading the coefficients consecutively according to different wave velocities in heterogeneous media. The new scheme is capable of suppressing numerical dispersion errors using a large time interval because we introduce a Lax-Wendroff type time discretization, which utilizes the wave-field information of O(M1M2) neighboring grid points in each step, with merely O(M-1 + M-2) computation, where M-1 and M-2 are the stencil radii to generate the 2nd-order and 4th-order spatial derivatives. The improved computational efficiency and accuracy of OptTS are validated by substantial experiments using both theoretical analysis and numerical modeling. They show that in heterogeneous models, the maximal Courant numbers reach 1.0 and 0.85 in 2D and 3D cases respectively without severe temporal error, and the scheme is computationally nearly three times faster than its high-order counterpart, providing a powerful tool for large-scale modeling and high-resolution imaging.

AB We consider the implementation of a friction contact angle model in a Navier-Stokes VoF-CSF solver for the simulation of moving contact lines at the nano-scale. A liquid-liquid interface confined in a Couette flow generated by two solid walls moving at the same velocity in opposite directions is considered to discuss the relevance of the friction model. The simulations are compared with a reference case obtained using MD simulations by Qian et al. [46]. We show that the Navier Stokes simulations are able to reproduce the MD simulations for both the interface shape and the velocity field. The appropriate contact line friction is found to be grid convergent and of the same order as the friction measured in MD simulations. A detailed investigation of the interface shape has revealed an auto-similar linear profile in the center of the channel. Close to the wall the interface shape follows the classical Log evolution given by the Cox relation despite the wall confinement. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A periodizing scheme and the method of fundamental solutions are used to solve acoustic wave scattering from doubly-periodic three-dimensional multilayered media. A scattered wave in a unit cell is represented by the sum of the near and distant contribution. The near contribution uses the free-space Green's function and its eight immediate neighbors. The contribution from the distant sources is expressed using proxy source points over a sphere surrounding the unit cell and its neighbors. The Rayleigh-Bloch radiation condition is applied to the top and bottom layers. Extra unknowns produced by the periodizing scheme in the linear system are eliminated using a Schur complement. The proposed numerical method avoids using singular quadratures and the quasi-periodic Green's function or complicated lattice sum techniques. Therefore, the proposed scheme is robust at all scattering parameters including Wood anomalies. The algorithm is also applicable to electromagnetic problems by using the dyadic Green's function. Numerical examples with 10-digit accuracy are provided. Finally, reflection and transmission spectra are computed over a wide range of incident angles for device characterization.

AB In this research, we develop an online enrichment framework for goal-oriented adaptivity within the generalized multiscale finite element method for flow problems in heterogeneous media. The method for approximating the quantity of interest involves construction of residual-based primal and dual basis functions used to enrich the multiscale space at each stage of the adaptive algorithm. Three different online enrichment strategies based on the primal-dual online basis construction are proposed: standard, primal-dual combined and primal-dual product based. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods for high-contrast heterogeneous problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In contrast to conventional shock-capturing methods that introduce dissipation based on smoothness of a discrete solution, we propose to regularize the compressible Navier-Stokes equations by adding an artificial dissipation operator introduced by Howard Brenner. This regularization satisfies the first and second law of thermodynamics, ensures positivity of thermodynamic variables, and preserves the translational and rotational invariance at the continuous level. In this paper, we present a new class of artificial dissipation spectral collocation operators of arbitrary order of accuracy, that mimic some key properties of the continuous Brenner-Navier-Stokes diffusion operator at the discrete level. The new artificial dissipation operator preserves superconvergence of the corresponding baseline spectral collocation scheme, satisfies the summation-by-parts property and discrete entropy inequality, thus facilitating a nonlinear L-2-stability proof for the symmetric form of the regularized Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical results demonstrating accuracy and non-oscillatory properties of the new schemes are presented for both continuous and discontinuous flows. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Research on laminar-turbulent transition of wall-bounded parallel flows has usually focused on controlled scenarios where transition is triggered by perturbations having simple shapes and spectra. These disturbances strongly differ from the environmental noise usually present in experimental setups or industrial applications, where uncontrolled transition is usually observed. In this paper a new method is proposed to trigger uncontrolled transition to turbulence in wall-bounded parallel flows exploiting the receptivity of the flow to a volume forcing.
   Using some concepts provided by linear stability and sensitivity analysis, such as the resolvent, we propose a method for constructing a volume forcing capable of inducing stochastic velocity perturbations with a prescribed energy level, eventually leading to laminar-turbulent transition as a response of the system to external noise.
   The method has been tested in a channel flow configuration, using direct numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of the volume forcing constructed on the basis of optimal forcing functions. Subcritical transition to turbulence induced by the prescribed forcing has been investigated and compared to other transition scenarios, where deterministic perturbations are imposed for obtaining a turbulent flow. Finally, the fully developed turbulent flows induced by the proposed method has been analysed, showing that low-order statistics and energy balance equations are practically unaffected by the continuous synthetic forcing.

AB In this paper, we propose a Petrov-Galerkin finite element interface method (PGFEIM) to solve the elliptic and elastic interface problems with Bloch-periodic boundary conditions. The main idea of this method is to choose the standard finite element basis independent of the interface to be the test function basis, and choose a piecewise linear function satisfying the jump conditions across the interface to be the solution basis. The grid we use is a non-body-fitted grid. The PGFEIM is capable of dealing with sharp-edged interface problems with matrix coefficients and nonhomogeneous jump conditions. Further, we extend this method to compute the band structure of anti-plane transverse waves and in-plane elastic waves in phononic crystals. Different acoustic impedance ratios, arbitrary complex scatterer geometries and various material properties are considered and discussed. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the PGFEIM is nearly second order accurate in the L-infinity norm for interface problems, and it is accurate and efficient for computing the band structure of phononic crystals.

AB This paper describes an improved multi-dimensional Tangent of Hyperbola INterface Capturing (THINC) scheme that uses a direct time integration of the hyperbolic tangent function. The new time-integral THINC scheme is based on the assumption that the interface remains unchanged and moves with the velocity of the cell center during a computational time step. A time-varying hyperbolic tangent function representing the two-phase distribution is then constructed and directly integrated in time. Compared with existing THINC methods that generally use third-order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta (RK3) schemes to update the volume fraction, the proposed method requires only one reconstruction step, thus reducing the computational cost. Several classical advection tests have been implemented, and the results indicate that the proposed direct time-integral THINC method: 1) achieves computational errors close to those of the RK3 scheme at a computational cost that is close to that of the first-order explicit scheme; and 2) preserves better boundedness of the volume fractions than the original RK3-based THINC methods when using a larger steepness parameter beta and higher Courant numbers. The proposed approach is employed with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to solve a 2D dambreak problem, and the numerical results agree well with the corresponding experimental data, demonstrating the applicability of the direct time-integral THINC method.

AB The paper presents a fully-implicit and stable finite element and finite volume scheme for the simulation of freely moving particles in a fluid. The developed method is based on the Petrov-Galerkin formulation of a vertex-centered finite volume method (PGFVM) on unstructured grids. Appropriate extension of the ansatz and test spaces lead to a formulation comparable to a fictitious domain formulation. The purpose of this work is to introduce a new concept of numerical modeling reducing the mathematical overhead which many other methods require. It exploits the identification of the PGFVM with a corresponding finite element bilinear form. The surface integrals of the finite volume scheme enable a natural incorporation of the interface forces purely based on the original bilinear operator for the fluid. As a result, there is no need to expand the system of equations to a saddle-point problem. Like for fictitious domain methods the extended scheme treats the particles as rigid parts of the fluid. The distinguishing feature compared to most existing fictitious domain methods is that there is no need for an additional Lagrange multiplier or other artificial external forces for the fluid-solid coupling. Consequently, only one single solve for the derived linear system for the fluid together with the particles is necessary and the proposed method does not require any fractional time stepping scheme to balance the interaction forces between fluid and particles. For the linear Stokes problem we will prove the stability of both schemes. Moreover, for the stationary case the conservation of mass and momentum is not violated by the extended scheme, i.e. conservativity is accomplished within the range of the underlying, unconstrained discretizationscheme. The scheme is applicable for problems in two and three dimensions. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Lagrangian particle methods based on detailed atomic and molecular models are powerful computational tools for studying the dynamics of microscale and nanoscale systems. However, the maximum time step is limited by the smallest oscillation period of the fastest atomic motion, rendering long-time simulations very expensive. To resolve this bottleneck, we propose a supervised parallel-in-timealgorithm for stochastic dynamics (SPASD) to accelerate long-time Lagrangian particle simulations. Our method is inspired by bottom-up coarse-graining projections that yield mean-field hydrodynamic behavior in the continuum limit. Here as an example, we use the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) as the Lagrangian particle simulator that is supervised by its macroscopic counterpart, i.e., the Navier-Stokes simulator. The low-dimensional macroscopic system (here, the Navier-Stokes solver) serves as a predictor to supervise the high-dimensional Lagrangian simulator, in a predictorcorrector type algorithm. The results of the Lagrangian simulation then correct the meanfield prediction and provide the proper microscopic details (e.g., consistent fluctuations, correlations, etc.). The unique feature that setsSPASDapart from other multiscale methods is the use of a low-fidelity macroscopic model as a predictor. The macro-model can be approximate and even inconsistent with the microscale description, butSPASDanticipates the deviation and corrects it internally to recover the true dynamics. We first present the algorithm and analyze its theoretical speedup, and subsequently we present the accuracy and convergence of the algorithm for the time-dependent plane Poiseuille flow, demonstrating thatSPASDconverges exponentially fast over iterations, irrespective of the accuracy of the predictor. Moreover, the fluctuating characteristics of the stochastic dynamics are identical to the unsupervised (serial in time) DPD simulation. We also compare the performance ofSPASDto the conventional spatial decomposition method, which is one of the most parallel-efficient methods for particle simulations. We find that the parallel efficiency ofSPASDand the conventional spatial decomposition method are similar for a small number of computing cores, but for a large number of cores the performance ofSPASDis superior. Furthermore, SPASDcan be used in conjunction with spatial decomposition for enhanced performance. Lastly, we simulate a two-dimensional cavity flow that requires more iterations to converge compared to the Poiseuille flow, and we observe thatSPASDconverges to the correct solution. Although a DPD solver is used to demonstrate the results, SPASD is a general framework and can be readily applied to other Lagrangian approaches including molecular dynamics and Langevin dynamics.

AB We present an energy-stable scheme for numerically approximating the governing equations for incompressible two-phase flows with different densities and dynamic viscosities for the two fluids. The proposed scheme employs a scalar-valued auxiliary energy variable in its formulation, and it satisfies a discrete energy stability property. More importantly, the scheme is computationally efficient. Within each time step, it computes two copies of the flow variables (velocity, pressure, phase field function) by solving individually a linear algebraic system involving a constant and time-independent coefficient matrix for each of these field variables. The coefficient matrices involved in these linear systems only need to be computed once and can be pre-computed. Additionally, within each time step the scheme requires the solution of a nonlinear algebraic equation about a scalar-valued numberusing the Newton's method. The cost for this nonlinear solver is very low, accounting for only a few percent of the total computation time per time step, because this nonlinear equation is about a scalar number, not a field function. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented for several two-phase flow problems involving large density ratios and large viscosity ratios. Comparisons with theory show that the proposed method produces physically accurate results. Simulations with large time step sizes demonstrate the stability of computations and verify the robustness of the proposed method. An implication of this work is that energy-stable schemes for two-phase problems can also become computationally efficient and competitive, eliminating the need for expensive recomputations of coefficient matrices, even at large density ratios and viscosity ratios.

AB The purpose of this paper is to present a Variable Eddington Factor (VEF) method for the 1-D grey radiative transfer equations that uses a lumped linear discontinuousGalerkin spatial discretization for the Snequations together with a constant-linear mixed finiteelement discretization for the VEF moment and material temperature equations. The use of independent discretizations can be particularly useful for multiphysics applications such as radiation-hydrodynamics. The VEF method is quite old, but to our knowledge, this particular combination of differencing schemes has not been previously investigated for radiative transfer. We define the scheme and present computational results. As expected, the scheme exhibits second-order accuracy for the directionally-integrated intensity and material temperature, and behaves well in the thick diffusion limit. An important focus of this study is the treatment of the strong temperature dependence of the opacities and the spatial dependence of the opacities within each cell, which are not explicitly defined by the basic discretization schemes.

AB We propose a family of simple second order accurate schemes for the numerical solution of Euler equation of gas dynamics that are (linearly) implicit in the acoustic waves, eliminating the acoustic CFL restriction on the time step. The general idea is that explicit differential operators in space relative to convective or material speeds are discretised by upwind schemes or local Lax-Friedrics fluxes and the linear implicit operators, pertaining to acoustic waves, are discretised by central differences. We have compared the results of such schemes on a series of one and two dimensional test problems including classical shock tube configurations. Also we have considered low- Mach number acoustic wave propagation tests as well as nozzle flows in various Mach regimes. The results show that these schemes do not introduce excessive numerical dissipation at low Mach number providing an accurate solution in such regimes. They perform reasonably well also when the Mach number are not too small. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we develop a fast compact time integrator method for numerically solving a family of general order semilinear evolution equations in regular domains. The spatial discretization is carried out by a fourth-order accurate compact difference scheme in which fast Fourier transform can be utilized for efficient implementation. The resulting semidiscretized problem consists of a system of ordinary differential equations whose solution can be explicitly expressed in term of time integrators, and a desired numerical method is then obtained by further adopting multistep approximations of the nonlinear terms based on the solution formula. Linear stability analysis is performed for the method for secondorder in time evolution equations. Extensive numerical experiments with applications are also presented to demonstrate efficiency, accuracy, and stability of the proposed method in practice. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With the advent of modern data collection and storage technologies, data-driven approaches have been developed for discovering the governing partial differential equations (PDE) of physical problems. However, in the extant works the model parameters in the equations are either assumed to be known or have a linear dependency. Therefore, most of the realistic physical processes cannot be identified with the current data-driven PDE discovery approaches. In this study, an innovative framework is developed that combines datadriven and data-assimilation methods for simultaneously identifying physical processes and inferring model parameters. Spatiotemporal measurement data are first divided into a training data set and a testing data set. Using the training data set, a data-driven method is developed to learn the governing equation of the considered physical problem by identifying the occurred (or dominated) processes and selecting the proper empirical model. Through introducing a prediction error of the learned governing equation for the testing data set, a data-assimilation method is devised to estimate the uncertain model parameters of the selected empirical model. For the contaminant solute transport problem investigated, the results demonstrate that the proposed method can adequately identify the considered physical processes via concurrently discovering the corresponding governing equations and inferring uncertain parameters of nonlinear models, even in the presence of measurement errors. This work helps to broaden the applicable area of the research of data driven discovery of governing equations of physical problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a simple meshfree approach, from the grid generation to the final solution, for the simulation of 3D problems geometrically defined by CAD. First, the domain grid for 3D problems is generated through a discrete searching algorithm. Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) are employed, just as a choice among similar tools, to define the boundaries through geometrical control points obtained by the CAD program. A predefined regular grid of nodes, embedding the whole geometry, is then trimmed to follow the constructed boundaries. The spatial solution is performed by construction of shape functions satisfying the governing differential equation, through using exponential basis functions (EBFs). A straightforward strategy is proposed for choosing appropriate EBFs via their shape-parameters making the method efficient for solution of 3D problems. Several 3D Laplace and Helmholtz problems are solved and the results are compared with those of commercial programs to show the efficiency of the method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework in which one can identify and predict the numerical instability of the steady state solution due to the solution reconstruction for cell-centered finite volume methods on unstructured meshes and to stabilize the problem by optimizing the reconstruction stencil. In this work, we first develop and extend a mathematical method, introduced by Haider and his colleagues, to measure the stability impact of the reconstruction phase for both linear and nonlinear problems regardless of the solution. Second order and third order accurate advection and Burgers problems as well as second order Euler problems are used to present detailed practical results and discussion around the use of the local reconstruction map for stability analysis. This method shows that for a range of different physical problems, increasing the stencil size will usually lead to more stable problems. Additionally, an empirical study is performed which sheds light on connections between the mesh properties and the stability of the reconstruction, which in turn helps choose the reconstruction stencil more wisely. Secondly, we propose a systematic approach to optimize both the shape and the size of the reconstruction stencil for better numerical stability through eigenvalue analysis. In this approach, one can directly optimize the solution reconstruction stencil for every control volume to obtain better numerical stability and convergence properties for steady state problems. A second order accurate Euler problem as well as a third order accurate laminar Navier-Stokes problem are used to showcase the applicability of the algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, a weakly compressible updated Lagrangian particle hydrodynamics (ULPH) model [1] has been developed for multiphase flows with high density ratios and viscosity ratios. To enhance computation stability and prevent penetrations near the multiphase flow interface, a new surface tension resultant formulation based on the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) formulation [2], combined with the interface sharpness force, is also developed within the framework of ULPH method. The intermediate configuration is considered in the computational algorithm, and a modified predictor- corrector scheme is adopted to solve governing equations, which significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the ULPH model. Several numerical examples are presented to compare with either analytical or computational results obtained by using different numerical methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, Moving Particle Semi- implicit (MPS) method and Level Set (LS) method within the framework of Finite Element Method (FEM). The results indicate that the ULPH method has good accuracy, stability, and convergence properties in simulations of multiphase flows. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The simulation of phase change processes that occur at high rates, like the collapse of a vapor bubble or the combustion of dense energetic materials, poses significant challenges that include strong discontinuities in select field variables at the interface, high-speed flows in at least one phase, significant role of compressibility, disparate phase rate and acoustic time scales and advection dominated processes. In this paper we present a finite element based method that addresses these challenges. The discretization is continuous everywhere except at the interface and it inherits its stability properties from both continuous and discontinuous finite element formulations like the SUPG and interior penalty methods. We track the evolution of the interface mesh and accommodate its motion in the volume by moving the mesh in accordance with an elastic analogy within an arbitrary eulerian lagrangian (ALE) framework. This motion is interspersed with a few select steps of mesh modification. We demonstrate that the proposed method has desirable discrete conservation properties and outline a proof for its stability. We also describe how this method is implemented in a finite element code within an implicit predictor-corrector time stepping scheme. Finally we apply this method to a series of phase change problems involving an energetic material, where we verify its implementation and demonstrate its utility. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we introduce a family of explicit Runge-Kutta methods, referred to as Paired Explicit Runge-Kutta (P-ERK) schemes, that are suitable for the solution of stiff systems of equations. The P-ERK approach allows Runge-Kutta schemes with a large number of derivative evaluations and large region of absolute stability to be used in the stiff parts of a domain, while schemes with relatively few derivative evaluations are used in non-stiff parts to reduce computational cost. Importantly, different P-ERK schemes with different numbers of derivative evaluations can be chosen based on local stiffness requirements and seamlessly paired with one another. We then verify that P-ERK schemes obtain their designed order of accuracy using the Euler equations with arbitrary combinations of schemes. We then demonstrate that P-ERK schemes can achieve speedup factors of approximately five for simulations using the Navier-Stokes equations including laminar and turbulent flow over an SD7003 airfoil. These results demonstrate that P-ERK schemes can significantly accelerate the solution of stiff systems of equations when using an explicit approach, and that they maintain accuracy with respect to conventional Runge-Kutta methods and available reference data.

AB We introduce a novel location-based moving mesh algorithm MMSISL in which the arrival points in the Semi-Implicit Semi-Lagrangian (SISL) algorithm are located by using an equidistribution strategy. This algorithm gives a natural coupling between moving mesh methods and SISL methods. It involves little extra cost in implementation as it exploits the interpolation methods already embedded in the SISL algorithm. We apply this method to a number of partial differential equation problems in one-dimension, each of which have sharply defined features. We show that using MMSISL leads to a markedly improved performance over fixed mesh methods, with significantly reduced errors. We also show that unlike many adaptive schemes, no issues arise in the MMSISL algorithm from a CFL condition imposed restriction on the time step. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The role of raw plantain flour (RPF) and its citric acid (CA)-esterified counterpart (EPF) on the carbohydrate nutritional properties of cookies was investigated. Cookies were elaborated with commercial wheat flour (CWF), RPF, EPF, or a CWF-EPF blend, and assessed for composition, starch digestibility, texture and sensory properties. EPF-cookie showed the lowest digestible starch (DS) content and estimated glycemic index (pGI) (25.0% and 59.3, respectively). Cookies made with CWF-EPF exhibited the highest indigestible fraction values attributed to the synergistic presence of the RS from EPF and the protein and non-starch polysaccharides from CWF. All RPF containing cookies exhibited lower hardness than CWF-cookie. Although the use of RPF decreased consumer's acceptability compared to CWF-cookie, the cookies with EPF showed sensory characteristics of 52-65% compared with the CWF-cookie (100%). This study shows CA esterification of plantain flour as a successful strategy to manufacture cookies with low DS and pGI.

AB Chemically modified corn starch with sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) or citric acid (CA) and grape juice was used to produce edible films. Modification reactions were discussed by results of FT-IR scan, water solubility, swelling power, viscosity and degree of cross-linking properties. Mechanical, barrier, physical (solubility, color, transparency, microstructure) and glass transition temperature properties of films were studied to understand the effects of grape juice and modified starch usage in films. Usage of starch cross-linked with STMP decreased significantly oxygen permeability from 5.82 to 2.51 cm(3) mu m m(-2) d(-1) kPa(-1), water vapor permeability from 1.89 to 1.38 g mm m(-2) h(-1) kPa(-1), solubility from 0.65 to 0.55 g soluble solid/total solid, percent elongation from 62.96 to 16.47. The chemical reaction between starch and CA affected barrier, solubility and elongation properties of films and values were higher than values of STMP films.

AB In this study, two different high-throughput microextraction techniques, microextraction by packed sorbents (MEPS) and micro solid phase extraction (p-SPEed (R)), were evaluated and compared, regarding the performance criteria, for the isolation of polyphenols from baby foods prior to their determination by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC). To achieve the best performance, influential parameters affecting extraction efficiency (including type of sorbent, number of extraction cycles, pH, elution solvent and elution volume) were systematically studied and optimized. To enable an effective comparison, selectivity, linear dynamic range, method detection (LODs) and quantification limits (LOQs), accuracy, precision and extraction yields, were determined and discussed for both techniques. Both methods provided the analytical selectivity required for the analysis of polyphenols in baby foods. However, mu-SPEed (R) sample treatment in combination with UHPLC-PDA has demonstrated to be more sensitive, selective and efficient than MEPS. Appropriate linearity in solvent and matrix-based calibrations, very low LODs and LOQs, ranging between 1.37 and 13.57 mu g kg(-1) and 4.57 - 45.23 mu g kg(-1) , respectively, suitable recoveries (from 67 to 97%) and precision (RSD values < 5%) were achieved for the selected analyzes by mu-SPEed (R)/UHPLC-PDA. Finally, the validated methodologies were applied to different commercial baby foods. Gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, ferulic acid, rutin, naringenin and myricetin are the most dominant polyphenols present in the studied baby food samples. The proposed methodology revealed a promising approach to evaluate the nutritional quality of this kind of products.

AB Must nitrogen is very important for successful fermentation. Irrigation can influence vine nitrogen availability, and therefore must nitrogen content and wine quality. The aim of this work was to assess the effect of vine water status on the nitrogen concentration of cv. Tempranillo grown under semiarid conditions. A rainfed and two regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies, late (LDI) and early deficit irrigation (EDI) were applied during pre-and post-veraison respectively periods over two seasons in Badajoz (Spain). Twenty-eight amino acids, amines and ammonia were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the must. Results showed an effect of the pre-veraison vine water status on the must amino acid concentration. Higher values of nitrogenous indices were reached in musts from LDI treatments, mainly in the dry year. Significant correlations between pre-veraison stem water potential and 19 amino acid concentrations were observed. Therefore, LDI was a more suitable strategy for increasing the content of nitrogenous substances in the must.

AB The effect of heat on extractability and immunoreactivity of proteins from roasted peanut flours and whole peanuts was evaluated using two general protein assays and six commercial peanut ELISA kits, respectively. The highest amount of protein was recovered from roasted peanuts with all ELISAs, while recovery showed a decrease with increasing levels of roasting of the peanut flours. Only the Morinaga kit showed sufficient sensitivity to detect peanut at low concentrations of the dark roast peanut flours. Both the protein and immunoassays indicated a decrease in protein solubility with roasting. The underestimation by immunoassays is a combination of decreased solubility and heat induced changes in the proteins that are being targeted by the ELISA antibodies. These findings suggest that most commercial ELISA kits may not reliably quantify peanut present in dark roast peanut flours at <= 25 ppm.

AB Iron (Fe) and folic acid (FA) fortified parboiled rice was produced by applying 'brown rice parboiling' method. The effect of milling and the effectiveness of fortification were tested in relation to the amount of bioaccessible and bioavailable form of Fe and FA. An in vitro starch hydrolysis assay was employed to assess the effect on simulated glycaemic index (GI). The % bioaccessiblity of Fe and FA in the unmilled fortified rice were in the range of 57.6-65.8%, and 55.1-91.9%, respectively. The % bioavailability in the unfortified parboiled rice was negligible as compared to Fe (14.7-32.1%) and FA (13.5-27.5%) fortified rice. The GI of unfortified and fortified parboiled rice samples was in the range of 56-69, which was lower than the raw rice. The results demonstrated that this approach can be a novel and rapid method to produce micronutrient enhanced ready-to-em rice.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-analytical approach for origin authentication of cocoa bean shells (CBS). The overall chemical profiles of CBS from different origins were characterized using diffuse reflectance near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and attenuated total reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR) for molecular composition identification, as well as inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for elemental composition identification. Exploratory chemometric techniques based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to each single technique for the identification of systematic patterns related to the geographical origin of samples. A combination of the three techniques proved to be the most promising approach to establish classification models. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis modelling of fused PCA scores of three independent models was used and compared with single technique models. Improved classification of CBS samples was obtained using the fused model. Satisfactory classification rates were obtained for Central African samples with an accuracy of 0.84.

AB The current food safety concern for food integrity demands the availability of an accurate, easy and reliable analytical tool for assay development of nisin A in cheese. To address this, we report the application of isotopically labelled peptide sequence MSTKDFNLDLVSVSKKDSGASP(R) (without thioether bridges) as internal standard for determination of nisin A in cream cheese, mascarpone, processed cheese and ripened cheese without the need for matrix-matched calibration by triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry. Full method validation was performed according to the modified Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria and method robustness was checked on 10 random cheese samples. Internal standard provided significant improvement (p < 0.05) in method precision for determination of nisin A in all four types of cheese. Significant losses (p < 0.05) for Nisin A in cheese was observed one week later. A fit-for-purpose method using internal standard procedure for accurate quantitation of Nisin A in cheese becomes available.

AB In this work, the ultrasound-assisted extraction was employed for the first time as a sample treatment in the determination of Mn, Zn, Fe, Mg and Ca in non-centrifugal sugar by F AAS. Parameters that influence the extraction, such as composition of the extraction solvent, sample mass and sonication time were optimized in this work. The optimum condition for the extraction was the proportion of 60:40% (v/v) of HNO3:H2O2 as an extraction solution, 0.100 g of non-centrifugal sugar and 60 min of sonication. Analytical curves were built in an aqueous solution. Low quantification limits for Mn (0.021), Zn (0.008), Fe (0.030), Ca (0.389) and Mg (0.009) mg L-1 were determined, suggesting a good delectability of the methodology. Estimates of repeatability and intermediate precision demonstrated that the precision observed was within the limits recommended in the literature. Good accuracy of the method was verified through the high recovery rates (91-108%).

AB Lipid oxidation is a major contributor to the deterioration of the sensory quality of fat-containing dairy powders. Hydroperoxides are the primary oxidation products from unsaturated fatty-acids that readily yield a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds that can adversely impact product quality and shelf life. Headspace solid-phase microextraction gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry was chosen to quantify thirteen lipid oxidation compounds in whole milk powder encompassing a range of volatilities and chemical classes. A central composite rotatable design (CCD, alpha = 1.1) based on a 2(3) factorial table was used with response surface methodology to optimize the HS-SPME parameters; determined at; 45 min extraction time and 43 degrees C extraction temperature. The significant model terms were found to be extraction temperature (p < 0.05) and the interaction between time and temperature (p < 0.05). Precision, accuracy, LOD and LOQ were determined and the method was validated for whole milk powder.

AB How to effectively increase or decrease the ability of A. oryzae to produce enzymes was the key to improve the quality of soy sauce. However, multi-core property of A. oryzae resulted in genetic instability of the new strain. Here, A. oryzae 3.042-3 which can stably produce mononuclear spores was constructed based on A. oryzae 3.042. A. oryzae 3.042-3-c obtained by transformation of the fragment of cis-CreA into A. oryzae 3.042-3 exhibited genetic stability. The fragment containing the cis-acting and the promoter CreA from A. oryzae was connected to chromosome VII in A. oryzae 3.042-3-c. Compared with A. oryzae 3.042-3, the cellulase activity of A. oryzae 3.042-3-c was reduced by 50.5% and the pectinase activity was decreased by 10.0%. M the end of the soy sauce fermentation, the salt-free solid content of A. oryzae 3.042-3-c was higher 58.9% than that of A. oryzae 3.042-3. The kinds and contents of the flavor components of the soy sauce from the fermentation by A. oryzae 3.042-3-c were higher than those of the A. oryzae 3.042 and A. oryzae 3.042-3, especially in alcohols and esters. HEMF was only found in the soy sauce from A. oryzae 3.042-3-c. The results indicated that the new strain A. oryzae 3.042-3c could improve the quality of soy sauce from the low-salt solid fermentation by decreasing enzyme activity of cellulase and pectinase.

AB Ethyl carbamate (EC) is a potentially carcinogenic substance present in most alcoholic beverages, especially in Chinese rice wine. Consequently, much effort has been directed at suppressing EC formation during the production of these beverages, with particular attention directed at the use of urethanase, as this enzyme can directly catalyze EC degradation. Herein, we investigated the ability of three lactic acid bacteria (Oenococcus oeni, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus plantarum) to generate urethanase during co-cultivation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. qPCR and transcriptomic analyses revealed that 57 genes of S. cerevisiae were significantly expressed in the presence of L. brevis, which highlighted the importance of studying urethanase-promoted EC degradation for establishing a powerful technique of EC level control. The obtained results provided deep insights into the adaptive responses of S. cerevisiae to the challenging environment of mixed-culture fermentation.

AB Accurate and early diagnosis of mycotoxin is particularly significant to the food and agricultural product safety. In the present work, a sensitive and effective monitoring method for zearalenone (ZEN) was exploited based on a novel self-enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor. The self-enhanced lumonophore was compounded by electrostatically combining amine-functionalized Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) -doped silica nanoparticles (NH2-Ru@SiO2 NPs) and nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) together. Since the emitter and co-reactant simultaneously existed in the same nanoparticle, shortened electron-transfer distance and decreased energy loss was obtained. Therefore, self-enhanced ECL aptasensor based on the novel complex expressed the widest linear range of 10 fg mL(-1)-10 ng mL(-1) and the lowest detection limit of 1 fg mL(-1) for ZEN detection. More importantly, ZEN produced during the mildew process of corn flour was monitored by the developed aptasensor, which exhibited superior determination and potential application in real samples.

AB This study aimed to evaluate and compare the antioxidant compounds of raw and cooked Longissimus lumbontm muscles from Suino Nero Lucano (SNL) and a modern crossbred (CG) pig. Vitamin E, phenols, histidine-containing peptides, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity have been detected in the raw and cooked meat of both genetic types. Cooking process decreased the content of all considered antioxidant compounds (P < 0.05). The antioxidant compounds of meat were significantly influenced by genetic type (P < 0.001). Autochthonous SNL raw and cooked meat showed a higher endogenous antioxidants content (P < 0.001) and SOD activity (P < 0.02) compared to CG meat. The results of this research highlighted that the pig meat, in particular autochthonous pig meat, showed good concentrations of endogenous antioxidant compounds that could confer functional properties to the product.

AB The determination of ethanol is one of the most important parameters in the fermentation industry, influencing not only the production yield and the quality of the product, but also its commercial value. In addition to the traditional approach based on distillation/density, procedure that is considered laborious and time-consuming, methods based on chromatography are widely used. Alternatives using electrochemical, spectroscopic and colorimetric techniques have been also proposed for alcohol analysis. In general, these methods not only offer limited throughput, but also require harsh reaction conditions and/or complex instrumentation. Aiming to address these shortcomings, we propose a fast, simple and clean analytical approach for the determination of primary alcohols based on the photochemical oxidation under UV-LED irradiation in the presence of H2O2. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of 12 different types of alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content ranging from 5% v/v (beer) to 53% v/v (whiskey).

AB Ultrafiltration of Cyclopia genistoides extract was optimised to increase its benzophenone and xanthone content as quantified using HPLC-DAD. Regenerated cellulose (RC) and polyethersulphone membranes with molecular weight cut-offs of 10 and 30 kDa were evaluated in terms of compound enrichment, permeate flux and permeate yield, using dead-end ultrafiltration. Compound enrichment was subsequently optimised using the 10 kDa RC membrane and tangential flow ultrafiltration (TFU). The effect of extract composition on compound enrichment, due to natural variation in the source material, was assessed using extracts from different batches of plant material (n = 11). Transmembrane pressure and feed flow rate affected (p < 0.05) process efficiency (mean permeate flux, compound enrichment and membrane fouling). TFU achieved >= 20% enrichment of the target compounds, proving its suitability for preparation of a nutraceutical extract of C. genistoides.

AB Arsenic and its inorganic species: As (III), As (V), dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) and monomethylarsenic acid (MMA) were determined in hypoallergenic formulas and grain porridges commercially available on Polish market, dedicated for infant 0-8 months. After quantitative extraction with 0.5% HNO3, separation of individual species was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and their determination by neutron activation analysis (NAA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Due to relatively low content of As in the analysed samples, it was only possible to determine DMA using the HPLC-ICP-MS mode. HPLC separation coupled with off-line determination by NAA enabled the determination of more extracted As species (especially inorganic) with good accuracy. Certified reference material (CRM) Rice Flour SRM 1568b (NIST) was used for the validation of both procedures.

AB Sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) was used as a gelling agent to structure oleogels at concentrations of 7%, 9%, 11%, and 13% (w/w) with sunflower oils in this study, respectively. The physical characteristics of oleogels, such as solid fat content (SFC), oil bonding capability (OBC) and firmness, were influenced by SSL crystals. Therefore, the microstructure and interaction of oleogels was further investigated by polarizing light microscopy (PLM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), rheology, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was found that the higher concentration of oleogelator resulted in a denser crystalline network, which provided stronger mechanical strength and enhanced the ability to retain the oil phase. Space-spanning networks were attributed to surface interactions among crystals of SSL, such as van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion.

AB The effect of eugenol (EUG) on chilling injury (CI) to eggplant fruit (Solanum melongena L.) was investigated. Eggplant fruit were pre-treated with 25 mu L/L EUG, and then stored at 4 degrees C for 12 days. Results showed that EUG fumigation treatment effectively retarded the CI development, reduced pulp browning, weight loss, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and sustained soluble solids content (SSC) and proline content. Moreover, the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) were inhibited by EUG. C-repeat/dehydrationresponsive element binding factors (CBF) genes are transcription factors playing a critical role in cold acclimation. To illuminate the molecular regulation of EUG on chilling tolerance in eggplant fruit, a 1151 bp SmCBF gene was identified and the effect of EUG on SmCBF expression was determined by RT-qPCR. EUG resulted in a higher SmCBF expression. These findings suggested that EUG treatment had potential effect on alleviating CI in eggplant fruit.

AB A simple and fast solid phase microextraction method using magnetic dextran (Sephadex G-150) as a sorbent was developed for the extraction, separation and speciation analysis of chromium ions. The retained Cr(VI) ions on the magnetic dextran sorbents were eluted and detected by linear sweep voltammetry at the gold nanoparticles modified screen- printed carbon electrode. The linear range, detection limit, quantification limit, and preconcentration factor of the established method for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) were calculated to be 0.5-10 mu M, 0.01 mu M, 0.1 mu M, and 40, respectively. Chromium(III) concentration was determined after conversion of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) by H2O2 in alkaline media (NH4OH). The method was successfully applied to the speciation and determination of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in artificial water and food samples using the standard addition method. The applicability of the method was confirmed by analysis of real food samples yielding good recovery values (92% and 102%).

AB Successful isolation of polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) from citrus peels has led to numerous evaluations of PMFs in a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as inhibition of chronic inflammation, cancer prevention and anti-atherogenic properties. Recent reports associated with the health promoting properties of PMFs in citrus fruits have dramatically increased. However, the limiting factor in animal and human study of PMFs is still the supply of pure PMFs, such as tangeretin, nobiletin, sinensetin and 3,5,6,7,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone. Herein, we introduce the newly developed efficient separation method using high-performance counter-current chromatography (HPCCC) in isolating multiple pure single PMFs simultaneously in one cycle process. With the smallest preparation loop on the semi-preparative HPCCC instrument, the optimized solvent system of hexanes/ethyl acetate/methanol/water resulted in the isolation of pure sinensetin, tangeretin, nobiletin, 3,5,6,7,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone, 5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone and 3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone directly from crude sweet orange peel extract in one cycle of separation process by HPCCC in the mode of reverse phase. The purity of each of the six isolated PMFs is greater than 96.6% analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. Scale-up and high purity of individual PMFs can be separated by using a large separation loop in preparative HPCCC model. The renovated HPCCC methodology can be practically used in natural product isolation and consequent biological property evaluation.

AB Compositional characterization was performed on seven 'Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio' (PPV) tomato landraces, a signature product of Campania (Italy) threatened by genetic erosion. Characterization encompassed determinations of macro-minerals, soluble carbohydrates, starch, acidity, lycopene, polyphenols, anthocyanins, protein and free amino acids. Exceptionally high dry matter (13.0 +/- 0.2%) and sugar content (101.3 +/- 3.8 mu mol g(-1) fw) and very low (0.007-0.009) Na/K ratio were invariably obtained across landraces, contrasted by significant variation in acidity (28.5-3.9 g kg(-1) dw). Giagiu, Acampora and Riccia San Vito differentiated by high polyphenols content (131.8 +/- 2.5 mg 100 g(-1)) while Acampora, Cozzolino and Fofo by high lycopene content (13.3 +/- 10.6 mg 100 g(-1) fw). Glutamate, GABA and glutamine represented 65% of the 22 detected amino acids mean total content. Glutamate, linked to umami taste, was highest (19.2 mu mol g(-1) fw) in Fofo. Our results will contribute towards the systematic documentation of sensory and functional quality profiles of an important collection of tomato landraces.

AB Edible mushrooms constitute an appreciated nutritional source for humans due to their low caloric intake and their high content in carbohydrates, proteins, dietary fibre, phenolic compounds, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. It has been also demonstrated that mushrooms have health-promoting benefits. Cultivation of mushrooms, especially of the most common species Agaricus bisporus, represents an increasingly important food industry in Europe, but with a direct consequence in the increasing amount of by-products from their industrial production. This review focuses on collecting and critically investigating the current data on the bioactive properties of Agaricus bisporus as well as the recent research for the extraction of valuable functional molecules from this species and its by-products obtained after industrial processing. The state of the art regarding the antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-allergenic and dietary compounds will be discussed for novel applications such as nutraceuticals, additives for food or cleaning products.

AB Soy protein isolate (SPI) and sugar beet pectin (SBP) were adopted to fabricate double network (DN) gels via thermal treatment and laccase-catalysis. The concentrations of SBP (0.5%-2.5%, w/w) and SPI (4%-8%, w/w) were evaluated. DN gels showed higher holding water capacity (WHC, above 83%), compared with SBP single gel (75.96%). The presence of SPI improved the mechanical properties of gels significantly. Apparent phase separation could be observed when SPI concentration was 4%. Moreover, interpenetrating networks gradually formed with the increase of SPI concentration. The favorable structural heterogeneity and mechanical integrity derived from these polymers might be mainly responsible for the enhancement of the mechanical properties. The presence of SBP and laccase could improve the beta-sheet amounts of SPI and make it form more rigid structure according to the results of circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectra. The excellent performance of DN gels could enable the delivery of various components.

AB Future protein demand is expected to rise with global population growth. In this study a comprehensive sensorial analysis of the odor of honey bee (Apis mellifera) larvae and pupae as function of their diet (with and without added sugar solution) was performed, as well as nutritional values and antioxidant activity analysis. Honey bee brood powder is a potentially valuable nutritional source with 20-25% protein (dry matter basis), high antioxidant activity and polyphenol content. Main volatile compounds detected using GC-MS with HS-SPME injection were odorless pheromones that represented differences between larvae and pupae. The determined active odor compounds were 2- and 3-methylbutanal, diacetyl, nonanal, dimethyl sulfide and ocimene. A trained sensory panel described honey bee brood aroma profile mainly with buttery and milky attributes, with different life stages and diets giving similar profiles. Such studies can be useful for future development of food products with desired nutritional and sensorial characteristics.

AB Although specialized metabolite distributions in different tea (Camellia sinensis) tissues has been studied extensively, little is known about their within-tissue distribution owing to the lack of nondestructive methodology. In this study, desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry was used to investigate the within-tissue spatial distributions of specialized metabolites in tea. To overcome the negative effects of the large amount of wax on tea leaves, several sample preparation methods were compared, with a Teflon-imprint method established for tea leaves. Polyphenols are characteristic metabolites in tea leaves. Epicatechin gallate/catechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate/gallocatechin gallate, and gallic acid were evenly distributed on both sides of the leaves, while epicatechin/catechin, epigallocatechin/gallocatechin, and assamicain A were distributed near the leaf vein. L-Theanine was mainly accumulated in tea roots. L-Theanine and valinol were distributed around the outer root cross-section. The results will advance our understanding of the precise localizations and in-vivo biosyntheses of specialized metabolites in tea.

AB Amongst the processing technologies able to improve the functional features of cereal-based foods, sourdough fermentation using Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) has been recently rediscovered for its beneficial effects. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) bread doughs were prepared using LAB strains belonging to different Lactobacillus species and changes in phenolic acid, carotenoid content and antioxidant capacity were evaluated. Two L. plantarum strains out of six were able to significantly increase carotenoid content in the dough, suggesting that a higher mobilization/solubilisation of these antioxidant compounds occurs. Within different fractions (free, soluble-conjugated, insoluble-bound), the relative distribution of ferulic acid and antioxidant activity changes depending on the specific strain. Overall, results indicate that some LAB strains cause in situ changes, significantly increasing the content of functional compounds in doughs during fermentation. This, in turn, could improve the functional features of bakery foods characterised by a high content in carotenoids and other bioactive compounds.

AB Heat-stable peptidases released in refrigerated raw milk by psychrotrophic bacteria are responsible for UHT milk gelation. K-casein-derived caseinomacropeptides, identified by mass spectrometry, were constantly detected in gelled milk by capillary electrophoresis. Strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Ps. poae and Chryseobacterium joostei, selected among aprX-positive strains from raw milk, were incubated in milk up to 6 days at 4 degrees C before sterilization (98 degrees C/4 min). Samples were then stored at 25 or 40 degrees C, visually observed for gelation, and analysed for presence of caseinomacropeptides throughout 90 days of storage. Depending on cold pre-incubation time, caseinomacropeptides accumulated well before gelation onset in milk stored at 25 degrees C. Caseinomacropeptides were successively degraded, especially in milk stored at 40 degrees C, due to extensive proteolysis, and an abundant sediment developed instead of a gel. The caseinomacropeptides are here presented as an early indicator of UHT milk gelation and a mechanism explaining this phenomenon is proposed.

AB The role of chicken hemoglobin in lipid oxidation of washed chicken muscle exposed to high hydrostatic pressure (0, 200, 400 and 600 MPa) was examined. The observed decrease in redness was higher with elevated pressures (5.0 vs 3.7). During storage, redness decreased in samples exposed to 400 and 600 MPa. This decrease was concomitant with the progression of oxidation and the 2.5 fold decrease of soluble heme. An additional experiment was conducted to examine the effect of the hemoglobin mode of addition into pressurized muscle. The exposure at 600 MPa led to washed muscle oxidation even in the absence of hemoglobin, thus indicating that pressure treatments triggered lipid oxidation. However, the presence of native or pressurized hemoglobin into pressurized washed muscle caused more hexanal than the pressurized control without hemoglobin. Overall, results suggest that membrane disruption and the release of hemin are crucial for the onset of oxidation.

AB The ripeness of a grape is critical to berry composition and to the resultant wine. For wineries with a single cultivar occupying an extensive area, the total soluble solid of grapes can range from 22 degrees Brix to 28 degrees Brix. Accordingly, the influence of different harvest dates (ripeness) on berry compositions and on the resultant wine profile was investigated for Vitis vinifera L. cv. 'Cabernet Sauvignon.' Berry dehydration was observed as berry weight and juice yields decreased. Berry anthocyanins were concentrated and methylated anthocyanin levels fluctuated with increasing delays in harvesting. Hexanal and 2-hexenal levels in must decreased significantly as berries ripened. In the resultant wines, 2,3-butanediol levels increased. Wines harvested earlier were lighter, presented lower color intensity (CI) values and higher yellow% levels, and exhibited richer aroma profiles (compounds). Through a principal component analysis and discriminant analysis, the compounds characterizing each harvest date were identified.

AB Shrimps and prawns are especially subject to food fraud, which has consequences not only on the economy but also represents a potential risk for public health. Fatty acids (FA) of Penaeid shrimps have been largely explored in the literature, and although they are unable to discriminate shrimps geographical origin or species, they might provide an interesting tool to distinguish their production method (wild vs. farmed). The present study is based on a literature compilation of Penaeid shrimp FA profiles encompassing all continents and 28 species. It reveals that the ratio of FA 18:2 omega 6. + FA 18:3 omega 3/FA 16:1 omega 7 can differentiate wild vs. farmed Penaeid shrimps with 100% accuracy within the 207 FA profiles of the dataset considered. Assuming a normal distribution of the dataset, 94.4% of the farmed shrimps population is expected to exhibit a ratio above 2.92, and 99.7% of the wild shrimps population is expected to fall below 2.92.

AB A sensitive electrochemical sensor for BPA based on the AuPd incorporated carboxylic mull-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with synergetic amplified current signal was developed, where MWCNT was used as supporter to improve electron transport and poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) was used as dispersant for MWCNT and overcome the intrinsic van der Waals interactions between MWCNT and further increase metal NPs loading. The prepared MWCNT-PDDA-AuPd showed enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward BPA, which is better than those of homologous monometallic counterparts and MWCNT-PDDA though the content of AuPd is really low. The peak currents of BPA increased with BPA concentration in linear range of 0.18-18 mu M and the detection limit of 60 nM. The sensor showed high sensitivity, good stability, repeatability and can be used to detect BPA in milk and water samples with good performance, which demonstrate that MWCNTs-PDDA-AuPd nanocomposite may be an attractive material in applications of environmental and food analysis.

AB The presence of 2-acetyl-4(5)-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutyl)-imidazole (THI) in beverages has raised several concerns regarding its toxicity to humans. The sample preparation and detection of THI in complex matrices is challenging owing to its high water solubility. Here we reported a rapid sample preparation method based on dispersive micro-solid phase extraction (D-iu-SPE) using polymer cation exchange sorbent as sorbent for the extraction of THI from beverage samples. THI was detected by high performance anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detector (HPAEC-PAD) and high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The experimental parameters of D-p-SPE on extraction efficiency were carefully optimized. Under the optimized conditions, high recoveries (83.4-96.1%) and good reproducibility (% RSD <= 8.7%) were obtained using D-mu-SPE-HPAEC-PAD and D-mu-SPE-HPLC-MS/MS. Limit of quantification was 75 ng/mL for HPAEC-PAD and 5 ng/mL for HPLC-MS/MS. This work proves the potential application the newly developed method for the quantification of THI in beverages containing caramel color.

AB Nitrosamines (NAs) as a group of emerging nitrogenous disinfection byproducts were present in drinking water at ng/L levels. Accurate measurements of NAs at such a trace level in samples is a challenging task. Solid phase extraction (SPE), which is used in the sample pretreatment, plays a critical role in the analysis of NAs in water. In this study, a highly selective and sensitive method for the determination of five less polar NAs, namely nitrosodiethylamine nitrosopiperidine, nitrosodi-n-propylamine, nitrosodibutylamine and nitrosodiphenylamine, in water and beverage samples was developed. A new molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was synthesized and used as sorbents in SPE for the sample preparation. Prepared samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Satisfactory recoveries were obtained at three different concentrations (5, 20, and 50 ng/L, n = 3) in the range of 93-107% with relative standard deviations of 3.1-9.8%. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation for the five NAs were in the range of 0.2-0.7 ng/L and 0.6-2.1 ng/L, respectively. Method precisions ranged from 4.9% to 10.5%. This novel method of MIP-SPE coupled with HPLC-MS/MS was successfully applied to the determination of these five NAs in different types of water and beverages samples.

AB This research aimed to correlate the composition of green Arabica coffee beans with the sensory quality coffee brews. The chemical composition of green Arabica coffee bean (66 samples) from three coffee quality contests was analyzed by near-infrared spectroscopy. Coffee brews with lower quality scores were correlated with high levels of caffeine, protein, chlorogenic acids and total titratable acidity (TTA) in the green coffee beans. High sucrose/TTA and cafestol/kahweol ratios in the green coffee beans were usually associated with higher scores for the coffee brews. By multivariate analysis techniques, the samples were separated into groups according to production years indicating a strong influence of the environmental conditions on the chemical composition. The profile of the composition of the crude coffee can be indicative of the sensory quality of the coffee brews, relevant information for producers and industry since the green beans are the material used for trading and purchasing coffee.

AB In the present study, the bamboo shoot (Chimonobambusa quadrangularis) residue (BSR)-derived polysaccharides (CPS) were dried using different drying procedures, including hot air-, vacuum-, freeze-, and spray-drying. The influences of different drying procedures on the chemical compositions, physicochemical characteristics, and antioxidant activity of CPS were investigated. The results indicate that freeze-dried CPS possessed the highest polysaccharide yield (8.86%) and uronic acid content (9.42%), and the lowest medium-high molecular weight (117.49 kDa) and glucose content (5.81 mol%). Also, freeze-dried CPS had better water (5.17 g/g) and oil retention capacities (2.32 g/g) than hot air- and vacuum-dried CPS. Moreover, freeze-dried CPS exhibited the most potent antioxidant ability. Based on correlation analysis, a higher uronic acid content, lower molecular weight and lower glucose content might be closely associated with the better antioxidant activity of the freeze-dried CPS. Hence, the above results revealed freeze-drying was the optimal method for industrial production of high quality CPS.

AB Hot air (HA) treatment and ultraviolet C (UV-C) irradiation have been demonstrated to control chilling injury in peaches. However, little is known about the effects of HA and UV-C treatments on volatiles changes in peach fruit during cold storage. In this study, peaches were treated with HA at 40 degrees C for 4 h or irradiated with UV-C lamp (1.5 kJ/m(2)), and then stored at 1 degrees C for 35 days plus 3 days of shelf life at 20 degrees C. Results showed that HA and UV-C suppressed chilling injury significantly, exhibiting lower internal browning index. Also, the two treatments enhanced emissions of esters and lactones in peaches by increasing enzymes of alcohol acyltransferase (AAT), fatty acid desaturase (FAD) acetyl coenzyme A transferase (ACX). These suggested that the increase of fruity note aromas in peaches by the two treatments is closely associated with aroma-related metabolism (LOX pathway and lactone pathway).

AB Rice and legumes have great potential in the development of novel gluten-free snacks that are healthier than traditional snacks. Novel gluten-free extruded foods (composed of rice: 50-80%, beans: 20-40% and carob: 5-10%) were analysed and the extrusion effects regarding organic acids, tocopherols, phenolic compounds and bioactive properties were evaluated. The total concentration of organic acids was not significantly affected by extrusion, while tocopherols showed a significant reduction. Extrusion did not produce an increase of the total phenolic content. For the bioactivity assays, commercial extruded rice, carob and most of the extruded samples showed anti-proliferative activity, which was higher than in the non-extruded samples, while for the anti-inflammatory activity, the extrusion process did not show a significant effect. Regarding the antimicrobial activity, low potential was observed with extruded and non-extruded samples showing high values of MIC and MBC as the microorganisms tested were multi-resistant isolated clinical strains.

AB Little is known about the variations of fresh fruit biomembrane and its physiological and biochemical characteristics during storage. A navel orange mutant 'Gannan No.1' (Citrus sinensis Osbeck) showed higher membrane stability and titratable acid while lower calyx senescence compared with wild-type 'Newhall'. The membrane damage was significantly reduced in 'Gannan No.1' under 10% polyethylene-glycol (41.16% vs. 8.77%) and 30% polyethylene-glycol (52.59% vs.16.11%) treatments on day 45 after harvest. Consistently, membrane electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde were significantly decreased in 'Gannan No.1', and superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase were activated. A metabolic analysis was performed to evaluate membrane fatty acid unsaturation and peroxidation. Linolenic acid and hexadecylenic acid contributed to the higher degree of unsaturated fatty acids in 'Gannan No.1'. Furthermore, 'Gannan No.1' accumulated stress-resistant metabolites such as proline, alpha-tocopherol and glutathione. Correlation analysis of membrane homeostasis indexes with quality parameters showed the importance of biomembrane stability in maintaining citrus fruit quality.

AB Early detection of Aspergillus spp. contamination in rice was investigated by electronic nose (E-nose) in this study. Sterilized rice artificially inoculated with three Aspergillus strains were subjected to GC-MS and E-nose analyses. Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Back-propagation neural network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) were employed for qualitative classification and quantitative regression. GC-MS analysis revealed a significant correlation between the volatile compounds and total amounts/species of fungi. While X-axis barycenters of PC1 scores were significantly correlated with fungal counts, logistic model could be employed to simulate the growth of individual fungus (R-2 = 0.978-0.996). Fungal species and counts in rice could be classified and predicted by BPNN (96.4%) and PLSR (R-2 = 0.886-0.917), respectively. The results demonstrated that E-nose combined with BPNN might offer the feasibility for early detection of Aspergillus spp. contamination in rice.

AB Biochemical effects of the water soluble fiber fraction of sugarcane bagasse (BSF) fermented in the colon was examined to evaluate its potential health promoting effects. A feeding experiment involving Fischer 344 rats, was conducted with 3 experimental diets containing, cellulose (CON), a commercial xylo-oligosaccharide (XYO) and BSF (BGS). Cumulative feed intake was significantly lower in XYO group while cecal weight was significantly higher. Acetic and propionic acid contents in the cecal content were significantly higher in the BGS and XYO, respectively. Total short chain fatty acid content was significantly higher in BGS and XYO resulting significantly lower cecal pH. Beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Akkermansia and Roseburia abundance was significantly higher in the XYO and BGS groups. Further, mucin and immunoglobulin-A contents were significantly higher in BGS group compared to CON group. Thus, BSF exhibited its ability to enhance the intestinal and systemic health upon fermentation in the colon.

DE Menaquinone-7; MK-7; Vitamin K2; Microencapsulation
ID ARTERIAL STIFFNESS
AB Szterk et al. (Food Chemistry 243 (2018) 403-409) have recently analyzed the content of menaquinone-7 (MK-7) in eight dietary supplements. The authors concluded that five out of eight were below the declared content. For all samples, the authors used tetrahydrofuran (THF) to extract MK-7 prior to analysis. Two of the tested products that were below the declared content were microencapsulated MK-7 which had a coating with limited solubility in THF. By dissolving the coating with water and ethanol prior to extraction with ethyl acetate, all MK-7 will be made accessible prior to analysis by HPLC. We have repeated the analysis of the two microencapsulated products that Szterk et al. claimed were below the declared content, and have shown they contain 102% and 105% of the label claim. Since Szterk et al. have used a solvent that does not dissolve the coating on microencapsulated MK-7, their conclusion is not justified and is thus misleading.

AB The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess potato omics profiles of new varieties for meaningful differences from analogous profiles of commercial varieties through the SIMCA one-class classification model. Analytical profiles of nine commercial potato varieties, eleven experimental potato varieties, one GM potato variety that had acquired Phytophtora resistance based on a single insert with potato-derived DNA sequences, and its non-GM commercial counterpart were generated. The ten conventional varieties were used to construct the one-class model. Omics profiles from experimental non-GM and GM varieties were assessed using the one-class SIMCA models. No potential unintended effects were identified in the case of the GM variety. The model showed that varieties that were genetically more distant from the commercial varieties were recognized as aberrant, highlighting its potential in determining whether additional evaluation is required for the risk assessment of materials produced from any breeding technique, including genetic modification.

AB Genetically modified (GM) maize and their non-modified counterparts were compared using MON810 varieties, the only GMO event cultivated in Europe. The differences in grain samples were analysed by omics profiles, including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Other cultivated maize varieties were analysed as a reference for the variability that will exist between cultivated varieties. The observed differences between modified and non-modified maize varieties do not exceed typical differences between non-modified varieties. The use of these advanced analytical approaches to analyse novel plant materials as compared to the results from animal feeding trials with whole foods is assessed. No indications were observed for changes in the GM varieties that warrant further investigations. Furthermore, it was shown that such indications will be obtained if maize samples of inferior quality are analysed similarly. Omics data provide detailed analytical information of the plant material, which facilitates a risk assessment procedure of new (GM) plant varieties.

AB In recent years, nitric oxide (NO) has been considered a plant signaling compound involved in antioxidant systems and flavonoid production enhancement. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action, from the perspective of protein expression, remains largely unknown. In this study, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) was employed to investigate NO donor sodium nitroprusside treatment-induced proteomic changes in soybean sprouts. Among the 3033 proteins identified, compared with the control, sodium nitroprusside treatment up- and down-regulated 256 proteins. These proteins were involved in antioxidant system pathways, such as the thioredoxin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways, including allene oxide synthase and lipoxygenase. In addition, heat shock proteins (HSPs) and flavonoid biosynthetic proteins, such as cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, chalcone isomerase, chalcone synthase, isoflavone synthase and isoflavone reductase, were also modulated in response to sodium nitroprusside treatment.

AB Adjuvant Systems (AS) are combinations of immune stimulants that enhance the immune response to vaccine antigens. The first vaccine containing an AS (AS04) was licensed in 2005. As of 2018, several vaccines containing AS04, AS03 or AS01 have been licensed or approved by regulatory authorities in some countries, and included in vaccination programs. These vaccines target diverse viral and parasitic diseases (hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, malaria, herpes zoster, and (pre)pandemic influenza), and were developed for widely different target populations (e.g. individuals with renal impairment, girls and young women, infants and children living in Africa, adults 50 years of age and older, and the general population). Clearly, the safety profile of one vaccine in one target population cannot be extrapolated to another vaccine or to another target population, even for vaccines containing the same adjuvant. Therefore, the assessment of adjuvant safety poses specific challenges. In this review we provide a historical perspective on how AS were developed from the angle of the challenges encountered on safety evaluation during clinical development and after licensure, and illustrate how these challenges have been met to date. Methods to evaluate safety of adjuvants have evolved based on the availability of new technologies allowing a better understanding of their mode of action, and new ways of collecting and assessing safety information. Since 2005, safety experience with AS has accumulated with their use in diverse vaccines and in markedly different populations, in national immunization programs, and in a pandemic setting. Thirteen years of experience using antigens combined with AS attest to their acceptable safety profile. Methods developed to assess the safety of vaccines containing AS have progressed the way we understand and investigate vaccine safety, and have helped set new standards that will guide and support new candidate vaccine development, particularly those using new adjuvants.
   Focus on the patient: What is the context? Adjuvants are immunostimulants used to modulate and enhance the immune response induced by vaccination. Since the 1990s, adjuvantation has moved toward combining several immunostimulants in the form of Adjuvant System(s) (AS), rather than relying on a single immunostimulant. AS have enabled the development of new vaccines targeting diseases and/or populations with special challenges that were previously not feasible using classical vaccine technology.
   What is new? In the last 13 years, several AS-containing vaccines have been studied targeting different diseases and populations. Over this period, overall vaccine safety has been monitored and real-life safety profiles have been assessed following routine use in the general population in many countries. Moreover, new methods for safety assessment, such as a better determination of the mode of action, have been implemented in order to help understand the safety characteristics of AS-containing vaccines.
   What is the impact? New standards and safety experience accumulated over the last decade can guide and help support the safety assessment of new candidate vaccines during development. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PERCEPTION; KNOWLEDGE
AB Background: News coverage supportive of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is widespread on the Internet. Meanwhile, large numbers of online comments questioning HPV vaccine safety, attacking vaccine manufacturers or providing personal experience of side effects may reduce the persuasion effect. This study explored how and under what conditions such comments influence the behavioral intention of subsequent youth female viewers or readers.
   Methods: We recruited a random sample of 239 Chinese undergraduate female students from different, non-medicine-related disciplines and conducted a 2 (valence of online comments: positive vs. negative) x 2 (presentation of comments: narrative vs. descriptive) between-subjects factorial design study. After carrying two ANOVAs to examine the effects of experimental conditions, we established a simple mediation and a moderated mediation analysis to test hypothesis.
   Results: Perceived risk of HPV emerged as a significant mediator in the moderated mediation model. Particularly under the negative condition, the narrative (vs. descriptive) comments increased behavioral intention to receive the vaccine (B = -0.20, SE = 0.10, 95% CI = -0.40 to -0.01) while they increased participants' perceived risk of HPV (B = -0.14, SE = -0.05, 95% CI = -0.27 to -0.06). However, under the positive condition, there was no significant difference in either risk perception or behavioral intention between the effects of narrative and descriptive comments on participants.
   Conclusions: Online comments do influence participants' perceived risk of HPV and vaccination intention. Perceived risk of HPV fully mediates the effect of comments on vaccination intention. More importantly, the indirect effect of narrative (vs. descriptive) comments on behavioral intention through risk perception is moderated by the valence of comments, and significant only under the negative comments condition.

AB Objective: Evidence-based strategies to address vaccine hesitancy are lacking. Personal values are a measurable psychological construct that could be used to deliver personalized messages to influence vaccine hesitancy and behavior. Our objectives were to develop a valid, reliable self-report survey instrument to measure vaccine values based on the Schwartz theory of basic human values, and to test the hypothesis that vaccine values are distinct from vaccine attitudes and are related to vaccine hesitancy and behavior.
   Methods: Parental Vaccine Values (PVV) scale items were generated using formative qualitative research and expert input, yielding 24 items for testing. 295 parents of children aged 14-30 months completed a self-report survey with measures of Schwartz's global values, the PVV, vaccine attitudes, and vaccine hesitancy. Factor analysis was used to determine vaccine values factor structure. Associations between vaccine values, vaccine attitudes, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccination behavior were assessed using linear and logistic regression models. Late vaccination was assessed from electronic medical records.
   Results: A six-factor structure for vaccine values was determined with good fit (RMSEA = 0.07, Bentler's CFI = 0.91) with subscales for Conformity, Universalism, Tradition, Self-Direction, Security-Disease Prevention, and Security-Vaccine Risk Vaccine values were moderately associated with Schwartz global values and vaccine attitudes, indicating discriminant validity from these constructs. Multivariable linear regression showed vaccine hesitancy was associated with vaccine values Conformity (partial R-2 = 0.10) and Universalism (0.04) and vaccine attitudes Vaccine Safety (0.52) and Vaccine Benefit (0.16). Multivariable logistic regression showed that late vaccination was associated with vaccine value Self direction (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.26-2.65) and vaccine attitude of Vaccine Benefit (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 032-0.60).
   Conclusions: The PVV scale had good psychometric properties and appears related to but distinct from Schwartz global values and vaccine attitudes. Vaccine values are associated with vaccine hesitancy and late vaccination and may be useful in tailoring future interventions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Health economic evaluations are often required before implementing a vaccination programme. Such evaluations rarely consider the historical context of a vaccination programme. We review the financial history of vaccination programmes in the Netherlands, and compare these to demographic and macroeconomic developments as well as avoided mortality burden.
   Methods: Previously uncatalogued historical expenditures on the Dutch National Immunisation Programme (NIP) and influenza vaccination were obtained from official reports. Costs were adjusted for inflation using Consumer Price Indices and expressed in Euro of 2016. Estimates on mortality burden averted were obtained from previous research and used to calculate the ratio of expenses to averted mortality burden for vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps and rubella for birth cohorts 1953-1992.
   Results: Developments towards a uniform government funded NIP started early 1950s with vaccinations against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus, culminating in its official launch in 1957 together with polio vaccinations. Since the 1980s, expenditure increased nearly five-fold mostly due to the addition of new vaccines, while spending on already implemented vaccinations tended to decline. Overall, expenditure increased from (sic) 5 million in 1957 to (sic) 93 million in 2014. Relative to total healthcare expenditure, the NIP contributed little, ranging between 0.05% and 0.14%. Spending on influenza vaccination increased from (sic) 37 million in 1996 to (sic) 52 million in 2014, while relative to total healthcare expenditure it decreased from 0.069% to 0.055%. In 2014, 0.15% of healthcare expenditure and (sic) 533 per birth was spent on vaccination programmes. Overall, for birth cohorts 1953-1992, (sic) 5.4 thousand (95% confidence interval: 4.0-7.3) was expended per year-of-life-lost averted.
   Conclusion: The actual costs per year-of-life gained are more favorable than estimated here since averted medical costs were not included. Although expenditure on vaccination programmes increased substantially, the contribution to overall healthcare expenditure remained small. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and is a re-emerging pathogen that also has the potential as a biological weapon, necessitating the development of a preventive vaccine. Despite intense efforts for the last several decades, there is currently not a vaccine approved by the FDA. The rF1-V vaccine adjuvanted with Alhydrogel is a lead candidate subunit vaccine for plague and generates a strong Th2-mediate humoral response with a modest Th1 cellular response. As immune protection against Y. pestis requires both humoral and Th1 cellular responses, modifying the rF1-V subunit vaccine formulation to include a robust inducer of Th1 responses may improve efficacy. Thus, we reformulated the subunit vaccine to include SA-4-1BBL, an agonist of the CD137 costimulatory pathway and a potent inducer of Th1 response, and assessed its protective efficacy against pneumonic plague. We herein show for the first time a sex bias in the prophylactic efficacy of the Alhydrogel adjuvanted rF1-V vaccine, with female mice showing better protection against pneumonic plague than male. The sex bias for protection was irrespective of the generation of comparable levels of rF1-V-specific antibody titers and Th1 cellular responses in both sexes. The subunit vaccine reformulated with SA-4-1BBL generated robust Th1 cellular and humoral responses. A prime-boost vaccination scheme involving prime with rF1-V + Alhydrogel and boost with the rF1-V + SA-4-1BBL provided protection in male mice against pneumonic plague. In marked contrast, prime and boost with rF1-V reformulated with both adjuvants resulted in the loss of protection against pneumonic plague, despite generating high levels of humoral and Th1 cellular responses. While unexpected, these findings demonstrate the complexity of immune mechanisms required for protection. Elucidating mechanisms responsible for these differences in protection will help to guide the development of better prophylactic subunit vaccines effective against pneumonic plague.

AB Background: To reduce the risk of vaccine-associated intussusception, rotavirus vaccination in Norway was implemented under strict age limits (the first dose given by 12 weeks of age and the second dose by 16 weeks of age) in 2014. We estimated the incidence of intussusception in children <2 years old before vaccine introduction and the number of vaccine-associated cases under current and extended age limits for vaccine administration in Norway.
   Methods: To estimate the baseline incidence, we validated all diagnoses in children <2 years old registered in the national hospital registry during the pre-vaccine period of 2008-2013. Using national vaccine coverage data and international estimates of intussusception risk after rotavirus vaccination, we calculated the numbers of expected vaccine-associated intussusception cases to compare with the estimated numbers of averted rotavirus cases. Uncertainty was accounted for by several scenario analyses using current and extended age limits for vaccine administration.
   Results: The pre-vaccine incidence of intussusception was 26.7 (95% CI 23.1-30.6) cases/year per 100,000 children <2 years old and 37.1 (95% CI 31.2-43.8) cases/year per 100,000 children <1 year old. In the 2016 birth cohort (approx. 60,000) vaccinated under the current age limits, 1.3 (95% CI 0.7-2.0) vaccine associated intussusception cases were expected to occur. If age limits were extended to 16 weeks for the first vaccine dose and 24 weeks for the second dose, leading to more children vaccinated at an older age, 2.2 (95% CI 1.2-3.5) excess cases would be expected in the same cohort. Simultaneously, an estimated 1768 rotavirus hospitalizations/year in children <5 years old would be averted under current age limits, with 98 additional rotavirus hospitalizations averted under extended age limits.
   Conclusions: Administering rotavirus vaccines beyond current age limits in Norway would lead to a marginal increase in the number of intussusception cases, which would be offset by the benefits of vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: South Africa introduced seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in 2009 and PCV13 in 2011. We aimed to compare the estimated impact of PCV on pneumococcal meningitis (PM) to impact of PCV on total invasive pneumococcal disease (tIPD) based on risk reduction after PCV introduction.
   Methods: We conducted national, laboratory-based surveillance for tIPD during 2005-2016. We estimated and compared rates of PCV13 and non-PCV13 serotype disease among tIPD and PM in individuals aged <5 years and >= 5 years, and compared these rates between the 2005-2008 pre-PCV introduction period and two time points after PCV introduction, 2012 and 2016.
   Results: We enrolled 45,853 tIPD cases; 17,251 (38%) were PM. By 2016, IPD caused by all serotypes decreased 55% (95%Cl -57% to -53%) for tIPD, and 54% for PM (95%CI -58% to -51%), 0.7% difference between estimates (p = 0.7). No significant differences were observed between PCV7-serotype disease reduction in tIPD and PM in both age groups or the additional 6 serotypes included in PCV13 in <5 year olds in 2012 and 2016. In 2012 there was a significant difference between increases in non-PCV13 serotype disease in those >= 5 years for tIPD and PM (32% greater increase in PM, p < 0.001), but this difference was absent by 2016. There was a significant difference between the estimated decrease in additional PCV13 type disease in 2016 between tIPD and PM for those aged >= 5 years (28% greater reduction in PM, p = 0.008).
   Conclusion: PM showed similar reductions to tIPD seven years after PCV introduction in vaccine serotype disease in those <5 years, and increases in non-vaccine serotype disease in all ages. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The persistence of tuberculosis (TB) as one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, the growing incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and the controversial efficacy of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine drives the development of new generation multistage vaccines against this disease that can boost BCG-primed immunity. The use of polymeric microparticles for this purpose increases due to their advantages, especially their good safety levels and intrinsic immunostimulant properties. We recently explored and demonstrated the reinforcing and adjuvant potential of starch microparticles (SMPs) that administered intranasally to BCG-primed BALB/c mice, alone or in combination with a recombinant antigen, increased survival rates and induced a reduction of bacterial load in the lungs of mice infected with tuberculosis. Here, we tested the effect of SMPs added to the BCG vaccine as adjuvant to the wholecell vaccine and investigated their contribution to the improvement of the protective efficacy of subcutaneous vaccination in mice challenged with virulent strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As expected, our results were dependent on the infection strains, showing that virulence is a crucial factor that affects the adjuvant activity of SMPs. Our results also confirm the adjuvant activity of this carbohydrate and its usefulness in diverse vaccination strategies not only for mucosal but also for parenteral administration.

AB Objective: Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine is recommended at birth; however, national coverage estimates fall far below target levels. Studies describing the factors associated with infant HepB vaccination are lacking. This study aimed to identify the sociodemographic, clinical and birth hospitalization factors associated with timely receipt of the first HepB vaccine dose.
   Study Design: This retrospective cohort study included Washington State infants born weighing >= 2000 g who received birth hospitalization care at an urban academic medical center between January 2008 December 2013. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between maternal and infant characteristics and HepB vaccine receipt during the birth hospitalization.
   Results: Of the 9080 study infants, 75.5% received HepB vaccine during the birth hospitalization. Infants had higher odds of being vaccinated during the birth hospitalization if they were Hispanic (AOR 2.08; CI: 1.63, 2.65), non-Hispanic black (AOR 2.34; CI: 1.93, 2.84) or Asian (AOR 2.70; CI: 2.22, 3.28) compared to non-Hispanic white. Infants with a Spanish- vs. English-speaking mother (AOR 1.97; CI: 1.46, 2.68), public vs. private insurance (AOR 2.01; CI: 1.78, 2.29), and those hospitalized >= 96 h vs. 24 to <48 h (AOR 1.67; CI: 1.34, 2.09) also had higher odds of vaccination.
   Conclusions: Populations that are typically underserved (e.g., publicly insured, racial/ethnic minorities) had higher odds of receiving HepB vaccine during the birth hospitalization. These findings may aid in identifying high-risk infants who could benefit from targeted interventions to increase initial HepB vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID WORLDWIDE
AB Background: In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) that set a target to eliminate measles and rubella in five of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2020. Significant progress has been made toward achieving this goal through intensive efforts by countries and Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI) partners. Accelerating progress will require evidence-based approaches to improve implementation of the core strategies in the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan. The M&RI Research and Innovation Working Group (R&IWG) conducted a web-based survey as part of a process to identify measles and rubella research priorities. Survey findings were used to inform discussions during a meeting of experts convened by the M&RI at the Pan American Health Organization in November 2016.
   Methods: The cross-sectional web-based survey of scientific and programmatic experts included questions in four main topic areas: (1) epidemiology and economics (epidemiology); (2) new tools for surveillance, vaccine delivery, and laboratory testing (new tools); (3) immunization strategies and outbreak response (strategies); and (4) vaccine demand and communications (demand). Analyses were stratified by the six WHO regions and by global, regional, or national/sub-national level of respondents.
   Results: The six highest priority research questions selected by survey respondents from the four topic areas were the following: (1) What are the causes of outbreaks in settings with high reported vaccination coverage? (epidemiology); (2) Can affordable diagnostic tests be developed to confirm measles and rubella cases rapidly and accurately at the point of care? (new tools); (3) What are effective strategies for increasing coverage of the routine first dose of measles vaccine administered at 9 or 12 months? (strategies); (4) What are effective strategies for increasing coverage of the second dose given after the first year of life? (strategies); (5) How can communities best be engaged in planning, implementing and monitoring health services including vaccinations? (demand); (6) What capacity building is needed for health workers to be able to identify and work more effectively with community leaders? (demand). Research priorities varied by region and by global/regional/national levels for all topic areas.
   Conclusions: Research and innovation will be critical to make further progress toward achieving the GVAP measles and rubella elimination goals. The results of this survey can be used to inform decision-making for investments in research activities at the global, regional, and national levels. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI) identified five key strategies to achieve measles and rubella elimination, including research and innovation to support cost-effective operations and improve vaccination and diagnostic tools. In 2016, the M&RI Research and Innovation Working Group (R&IWG) completed a research prioritization process to identify key research questions and update the global research agenda. The R&IWG reviewed meeting reports and strategic planning documents and solicited programmatic inputs from vaccination experts at the program operational level through a web survey, to identify previous research priorities and new research questions. The R&IWG then convened a meeting of experts to prioritize the identified research questions in four strategic areas: (1) epidemiology and economics, (2) surveillance and laboratory, (3) immunization strategies, and (4) demand creation and communications. The experts identified 19 priority research questions in the four strategic areas to address key areas of work necessary to further progress toward elimination. Future commitments from partners will be needed to develop a platform for improved coordination with adequate and predictable resources for research implementation and innovation to address these identified priorities.

AB Efforts to develop a vaccine for the elimination of malaria include the use of carrier proteins to assemble monomeric antigens into nanoparticles to maximize immunogenicity. Recombinant ExoProtein A (EPA) is a detoxified form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Exotoxin A which has been used as a carrier in the conjugate vaccine field. A pilot-scale process developed for purification of EPA yielded product that consistently approached a preset upper limit for host cell protein (HCP) content per human dose. To minimize the risk of bulk material exceeding the specification, the purification process was redeveloped using mixed-mode chromatography resins. Purified EPA derived from the primary and redeveloped processes were comparable following full biochemical and biophysical characterization. However, using a process specific immunoassay, the HCP content was shown to decrease from a range of 0.14-0.24% w/w of total protein to below the level of detection with the revised process. The improved process reproducibly yields EPA with highly similar quality characteristics as the original process but with an improved profile for the HCP content. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Perceptions of vaccination within a Christian homeschooling community in

AB Background: More than 1.8 million American children ages 5-17 are being educated at home. The percentage of school-aged children in the United States who are homeschooled increased from 1.7% in 1999 to 3.4% in 2012. Every state has established school-entry vaccination requirements for kindergarten students, but most states exempt homeschoolers from these regulations. The goal of this study was to use qualitative methods to examine the vaccination perceptions and practices of Christian homeschooling families in Pennsylvania.
   Methods: A qualitative study (focus groups) of Christian homeschooling parents representing a diversity of vaccination practices (full, partial/delayed, and no vaccination) was conducted in south-central Pennsylvania in 2017. An analysis using a grounded theory approach identified themes that strongly aligned with constructs from the Health Belief Model.
   Results: Many of the perspectives expressed by the study population aligned with those of the general American population, including uncertainty about the risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, concerns about the efficacy and safety of vaccines, and confusion about conflicting vaccine information. The Christian homeschooling parents expressed two especially prominent perceptions: a belief that they had a very low risk of contracting infectious diseases because God has provided them with the natural tools necessary for health and a stronger-than-typical sense of empowerment related to parental decision-making and autonomy. Participants expressed that they were generally open to honest communication about vaccination with physicians who respect parental authority.
   Conclusions: Homeschooling families have diverse vaccination practices. Pediatricians and other health-care practitioners should not make assumptions about health beliefs in this community, and should instead engage parents in conversations about their risk perceptions and vaccine decisions.

AB Background: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) among adults aged 65 years or older to assess public health impact.
   Methods: For all outcomes, we included all randomized subjects, using a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) approach to determine vaccine efficacy (VE), vaccine preventable disease incidence (VPDI) defined as control minus vaccinated group incidence, and numbers needed to vaccinate (NNV) (based on a five-year duration of protection).
   Results: Results are reported for, in order, clinical, adjudicated (clinical plus radiologic infiltrate determined by committee), pneumococcal, and vaccine-type pneumococcal (VT-Sp) community-acquired pneumonia; invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and VT-IPD. VEs (95% CI) for all hospital episodes were 8.1% (-0.6%, 16.1%), 6.7% (-4.1%, 16.3%), 22.2% (2.0%, 38.3%), 37.5% (143%, 54.5%), 49.3% (23.2%, 66.5%), and 75.8% (47.6%, 88.8%). VPDIs per 100,000 person-years of observation (PYOs) were 72, 37, 25, 25, 20, and 15 with NNVs of 277, 535, 816, 798, 1016, and 1342. For clinical CAP, PCV13 was associated with a reduction of 909 (-115, 2013) hospital days per 100,000 PYOs translating to a reduction over 5 years of one hospital day for every 22 people vaccinated. When comparing at-risk persons (defined by self-report of diabetes, chronic lung disease, or other underlying conditions) to not at-risk persons, VEs were similar or lower, but because baseline incidences were higher the VPDIs were approximately 2-10 times higher and NNVs 50-90% lower.
   Conclusion: A public health analysis of pneumonia and IPD outcomes in a randomized controlled trial found substantial burden reduction following adult PCV13 immunization implemented in a setting with an ongoing infant PCV7-PCV10 program. VPDIs were higher among at-risk adults. Funding: The original study and the current analysis were funded by Pfizer. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: VARIVAX (R) (varicella virus vaccine, live Oka/Merck, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA) was originally licensed as a frozen formulation. A refrigerator-stable formulation of VARIVAX was subsequently developed to allow for increased availability of the product around the world. The objective of this study (V210-051) was to demonstrate that the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity profile of the refrigerator-stable formulation of VARIVAX was similar to the frozen formulation.
   Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, multicenter study, healthy 12- to 23-month-old children with negative vaccination and clinical histories for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and zoster were vaccinated with either a refrigerator-stable formulation of VARIVAX (at two dosage levels; 8000 PFU [N = 320] or 25,000 PFU [N = 315]) or the frozen formulation of VARIVAX (10,000 PFU, N = 323) given concomitantly with M-M-RII (R) (measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccine live, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA). Children were followed for 42 days after vaccination for adverse experiences. Immunogenicity was evaluated 6 weeks after vaccination.
   Results: The refrigerator-stable formulation of VARIVAX was generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse experiences was similar between all three groups. No vaccine-related serious adverse experiences were reported with any of the vaccine formulations. The immune response (percentage of subjects with varicella antibody titers >= 5 gpELISA units) for both refrigerator-stable formulations of VARIVAX at 6 weeks postvaccination was similar to that of the frozen formulation. Administration of either refrigerator-stable formulation of VARIVAX with M-M-RII yielded seroconversion rates and GMTs for measles, mumps and rubella that were comparable to those achieved after administration of the frozen formulation of VARIVAX with M-M-RII.
   Conclusion: The safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profile of the refrigerator-stable varicella vaccine was similar to that of the frozen formulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Live viral vectors that express heterologous antigens of the target pathogen are being investigated in the development of novel vaccines against serious infectious agents like HIV and Ebola. As some live recombinant vectored vaccines may be replication-competent, a key challenge is defining the length of time for monitoring potential adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. This time period must be chosen with care and based on considerations of pre-clinical and clinical trials data, biological plausibility and practical feasibility. The available options include: (1) adapting from the current relevant regulatory guidelines; (2) convening a panel of experts to review the evidence from a systematic literature search to narrow down a list of likely potential or known AEFI and establish the optimal risk window(s); and (3) conducting "near real-time" prospective monitoring for unknown clustering's of AEFI in validated large linked vaccine safety databases using Rapid Cycle Analysis for pre-specified adverse events of special interest (AESI) and Treescan to identify previously unsuspected outcomes. The risk window established by any of these options could be used along with (4) establishing a registry of clinically validated pre-specified AESI to include in case-control studies. Depending on the infrastructure, human resources and databases available in different countries, the appropriate option or combination of options can be determined by regulatory agencies and investigators.

AB Deuterium incorporation in solid-state hydrogen deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (ssHDX-MS) has been correlated with protein aggregation on storage in sugar-based solid matrices. Here, the effects of sucrose, arginine and histidine buffer on the rate of aggregation of a lyophilized monoclonal antibody (mAb) were assessed using design of experiments (DoE) and response surface methodology. Lyophilized formulations were characterized using ssHDX-MS and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ssFTIR) to assess potential correlation with stability in solid state. The samples were subjected to storage stability at 5 degrees C and stressed stability at 40 degrees C/75% RH for 6 months, and the aggregation rate was measured using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Different levels of arginine had no significant effect on deuterium uptake in ssHDX-MS, although stability studies showed that aggregation rate decreased with increasing arginine concentration. Similarly, when histidine buffer was replaced with phosphate buffer at the same pH and molarity, ssHDX-MS showed no differences in deuterium uptake, but storage stability studies showed a significant increase in aggregation rate. The results suggest that proteins can be stabilized in amorphous solids by ionic interactions which ssHDX-MS does not detect, an important indication of the limitations of the method.

AB Monitoring of the coating end-point of functional coatings during the coating application process is desirable. Since currently available PAT methods require expensive test equipment, there is a need for a rapid test that can easily be applied without major investment. BARDS is a novel technique that has the potential to economise the production process of these kinds of pellet and tablet formulations. The thickness of a controlled release coating is a key factor that determines the release rate of the drug in the gastro-intestinal tract or other targeted functionalities such as taste masking or moisture protection. Correspondingly, the amount of drug per unit mass of pellets decreases with increasing thickness of the functional coating.
   In this study, the functional polymer loading of the coating process is investigated by testing pellets via BARDS technology (Broadband Acoustic Resonance Dissolution Spectroscopy). The technique offers a rapid approach (< 200 s) to characterising functional coatings at-line during their manufacture. Measurements are based on reproducible changes in the compressibility of a solvent during dissolution which is monitored acoustically via associated changes in the frequency of induced acoustic resonances. In case of enteric coatings a steady state acoustic lag time is associated with the erosion of the enteric coatings in acidic dissolution test media. This lag time is indicative of the coating layer thickness, assuming that the quality of the film coating is high. BARDS represents a possible future surrogate test for IPC testing, as a PAT method and possibly also for conventional USP dissolution testing. BARDS data correlate directly with the thickness of the functional coating, its integrity and also with the drug loading as validated by UV-Vis spectroscopy.

AB This study presents a modelling framework to predict the flowability of various commonly used pharmaceutical powders and their blends. The flowability models were trained and validated on 86 samples including single components and binary mixtures. Two modelling paradigms based on artificial intelligence (AI) namely, a radial basis function (RBF) and an integrated network were employed to model the flowability represented by the flow function coefficient (FFC) and the bulk density (RHOB). Both approaches were utilized to map the input parameters (i.e. particle size, shape descriptors and material type) to the flow properties. The input parameters of the blends were determined from the particle size, shape and material type properties of the single components. The results clearly indicated that the integrated network outperformed the single RBF network in terms of the predictive performance and the generalization capabilities. For the integrated network, the coefficient of determination of the testing data set (not used for training the model) for FFC was R-2 = 0.93, reflecting an acceptable predictive power of this model. Since the flowability of the blends can be predicted from single component size and shape descriptors, the integrated network can assist formulators in selecting excipients and their blend concentrations to improve flowability with minimal experimental effort and material resulting in the (i) minimization of the time required, (ii) exploration and examination of the design space, and (iii) minimization of material waste.

ID DRUG-DELIVERY
AB Poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) nanoparticles (PHBV-NPs) to encapsulate hydrocortisone (HC) for topical ophthalmic administration were prepared and characterized. The technique used to prepare the nanoparticles (NPs) was emulsification/solvent evaporation. The obtained size was 237.3 +/- 2.7 nm, suitable for topical ocular administration. The obtained results for the entrapment efficiency were between 1 and 2.5% and for the drug loading were around 0.5%. The release behaviour of HC from the PHBV-NPs was also analyzed, adjusting this to a Higuchi kinetic model. For the new drug delivery system developed the ocular toxicity profile was determined by viability studies carried out on bovine keratocytes, by a Hen's Egg Test - Chorioallantoic Membrane (HET-CAM) and by a Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability assay (BCOP). The obtained results concluded that the new system is no cytotoxic on bovine keratocytes and is neither irritating nor produces any alteration in the transparency and in the permeability of the cornea. Confocal studies were also performed and confirmed that PHBV-NPs are able to penetrate efficiently into the corneal tissue. This novel PHBV-based drug delivery system could be a good option for topical ophthalmic administration of drugs.

AB The fabrication of electrospun composite nanofiber mats used as drug delivery systems with controlled release property is of general interest in biomaterial sciences. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of MWCNTs on the release profile of the hydrophilic drug. For this aim, tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) loaded poly (lactic acid) (PLA)/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/TCH-multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composite fibrous mats were fabricated by electrospinning process, and the drug release profile, release kinetics and cytotoxicity were evaluated to determine the potential for utilization as drug delivery systems. Furthermore, the morphological and physicochemical properties of the composite PLA/PVP/TCH-MWCNTs fibrous mats were characterized. The results demonstrated that TCH and MWCNTs were successfully loaded into the PLA/PVP biopolymeric matrix and the addition of TCH or MWCNTs did not alter the uniform and beadless fibrous structure of the PLA/PVP fibers, resulting in increased Young's modulus and maintained the fibrous structure of the composite mats. Moreover, MWCNTs loaded electrospun mats showed much more controlled drug release manner, increased significantly the drug encapsulation efficiency and reduced the burst release of TCH. In vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that the PLA/PVP/TCH-MWCNTs composite mats did not have a toxic effect on the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). With the improved physicochemical and mechanical properties, controlled drug release-profile and cytocompatibility, the fabricated composite nanofiber mats may be used as therapeutic materials for the biomedical applications as drug delivery systems.

AB Nanoparticles of polymeric complexes made of hyaluronic acid and polyarginine were investigated for the encapsulation of the cationic hydrophilic drug pentamidine isethionate. The interaction between the anionic hyaluronic acid and the cationic pentamidine resulting in the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes was firstly studied. Then, nanoparticles made of hyaluronic acid and polyarginine loaded with pentamidine were developed. These drug delivery systems consist of a monodisperse population of negatively charged pentamidine-loaded nanoparticles with a high drug encapsulation rate (80%). Such high encapsulation efficiency coming from ion exchange was confirmed by measurements of the counterion isethionate released from pentamidine during nanoparticles formation. Besides, freeze-dried pentamidine-loaded nanoparticles kept their integrity after their reconstitution in water. In vitro studies on human lung (A549) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines showed that pentamidine-loaded nanoparticles were more cytotoxic in comparison to the free drug, suggesting an enhanced internalization of encapsulated drug by cancer cells.

AB Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major kidney disease associated with high mortality and morbidity. AKI may lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Currently, the management of AKI is mainly focused on supportive treatments. Previous studies showed macromolecular delivery systems as a promising method to target AKI, but little is known about how physicochemical properties affect the renal accumulation of polymers in ischemia-reperfusion AKI. In this study, a panel of fluorescently labeled polymers with a range of molecular weights and net charge was synthesized by living radical polymerization. By testing biodistribution of the polymers in unilateral ischemia-reperfusion mouse model of AKI, the results showed that negatively charged and neutral polymers had the greatest potential for selectively accumulating in I/R kidneys. The polymers passed through glomerulus and were retained in proximal tubular cells for up to 24 h after injection. The results obtained in the unilateral model were validated in a bilateral ischemic-reperfusion model. This study demonstrates for the first time that polymers with specific physicochemical characteristics exhibit promising ability to accumulate in the injured AKI kidney, providing initial insights on their use as polymeric drug delivery systems in AKI.

AB The subdivision behavior of polymeric tablets produced with the well-known polymers Soluplus (R) (SOL), polyvinyl pyrrolidone co-vinyl acetate (PVPVA) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) was evaluated in this study. The polymeric tablets were submitted to different post-treatments (aging, thermal and exposure to compressed gaseous carbon dioxide) and its mechanical, spectroscopic and microstructure properties were assessed. SOL tablets showed the best results for tablet subdivision, particularly, the mean mass variation (3.9%) was significantly lower than the other two polymeric tablets (7.2% and 9.1% for PVPVA and HPMC, respectively), and showed better results than common tablets produced from powder matrices (7-14%). SOL tablets were also more sensitive to the different post-treatments applied, which reduced the mass loss and friability from 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively, to values close to zero and without altering their porosity. The thermal treatment of PVPVA tablets, in turn, also led to similar subdivision results, with mass loss of 0.3% and friability of 0.02%. In contrast, the granules of HPMC presented compaction difficulties making its tablets unsuitable for the subdivision process, even after additional post-treatment. Polymeric matrices with uniform internal structure and appropriate mechanical strength are the key to a better adaptation for the tablet subdivision.

AB This study compared the in vitro and in vivo effects of different aliphatic acid grafted N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) surface-modified nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) by oral delivery. Medium-chain fatty acids, decylic acids (DA), and long-chain fatty acids, palmitic acids (PA) were selected as contrasting objects. TMC, DA grafted TMC (DA-TMC), and PA grafted TMC (PA-TMC) were successively synthesized. Kaempferol loaded NLC (KNLC), KNLC coated with DA-TMC (DA-TMC-KNLC) and PA-TMC (PA-TMC-KNLC) were fabricated, respectively. KNLC were subspherical in shape at nano-size limits. The particle size increased from 93.6 to 125.5 nm and the zeta potential changed from negative to positive due to surface-modification. The KNLC surface-modified with different aliphatic acid grafted TMC displayed a diverse release profiles at the simulative physiological environment, which contrasted that of KNLC. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the nanoparticles all could improve the AUC values and prolong blood retention times compared to that of kaempferol suspensions. Cell uptake and in situ intestinal perfusion experiments revealed that DA-TMC-KNLC and PA-TMC-KNLC could remarkably enhance cellular uptake of kaempferol into Caco-2 cells and drug absorption in each intestinal segment in comparison with KNLC, repectively. Wherein, DA-TMC-KNLC exhibits the greatest uptake and absorption efficiency as compared to kaempferol suspensions, KNLC and PA-TMC-KNLC. Collectively, DA-TMC surface-modified NLC might serve as a potential drug carrier for oral delivery of water-insoluble flavonoid ingredients.

AB Tazarotene (TAZ) is a topical synthetic retinoid used in psoriasis treatment, however, it is extremely lipophilic and exhibits skin irritation. Research is in a state of continuous advancement in the field of nanocarriers fabrication, and in this regard, we investigated the formulation of novel topically oriented nanovesicles; representing a combination of spanlastics and penetration enhancer vesicles, to be termed (fluidized-SNs). TAZ-loaded fluidized SNs were physicochemically characterized, tested for ex vivo cutaneous retention, and the selected formulation was compared with the marketed product Acnitaz (R) regarding clinical antipsoriatic activity. The selected fluidized-SNs enriched with 1% cineole exhibited high entrapment for TAZ (76.19%), suitable size and zeta potential of 241.5 +/- 5.68 nm and -36.10 +/- 2.50 mV respectively, and retaining of stability after refrigeration storage for one month. As hypothesized, cineole enriched fluidized-SNs exhibited remarkable TAZ deposition amounting to a total of 81.51% in the different skin layers. Upon clinical assessment, the presented formulation displayed superior traits compared to the marketed product, in terms of dermoscopic imaging, morphometric analysis of psoriatic lesions, and statistical analysis of PASI scores. Results confirmed that the prepared novel fluidized spanlastics formulation holds great promise for the treatment of psoriasis, and its benefit should futuristically be investigated in other topical diseases.

AB The growing interest in development of dry powder inhalation (DPI) products raises a need for development of standard testing methods and specifications for DPI excipients. The pharmaceutical industry, meanwhile, yet lacks compendial guidance on this topic. Despite of the complexity of interactions taking place in DPI systems and the large number and variety of interplaying factors, understanding of key determinants of performance (critical quality attributes) of DPI excipients have considerably developed over the past years. In light of the current knowledge in this area, this article provides technical guidance and insights on testing and quality control of carrier-based-DPI excipients. These excipients are, typically, blends of coarse, carrier particles and fine, performance-modulating particles. The article explores techniques used for measurement of key microstructural attributes, namely the particle size distribution, the porosity and the particle surface roughness, the particle shape, rheological properties, and the permeability, of these excipients. The technical relevance of each measurement to the functionality of the excipients is critically discussed. In this regard, caveats concerning use of some measurements and data analysis procedures are raised. The guidance lends itself for compendial adoption.

AB In order to improve efficacy and accessibility of vaginal microbicides, development of smart polymer-based delivery carriers appears essential. In scope of this study, the potential of chitosan glutamate in technology of microbicide multiunit formulations containing zidovudine-loaded microbeads was investigated. Spray-drying optimization was supported by statistical design of experiments. As polymer properties may alter upon processing, particularly important was to examine the influence of product composition and process variables on final microbeads characteristic. Data from ATR-FTIR, Raman, and DSC analysis confirmed drug compatibility with chitosan glutamate after spray-drying. Formulations with polymer: drug ratio 5:1 (w/w) prepared from azeotropic ethanol-water mixture were found to spread easily upon dilution with simulant vaginal fluid, forming viscous, shear-thinning barrier, which could impede direct contact of virus with mucus cells. Furthermore, the presence of ethanol was found crucial to overcome stickiness phenomenon by interrupting hydrogen bonding between drug and polymer. In vitro dissolution studies displayed an initial burst effect followed with prolonged (up to 4 h) drug release stage. By modifying spray-drying temperature, alterations in microbeads' swelling capacity and drug release were observed. Cytotoxicity studies using human vaginal cell line VK2/E6E7 revealed that drug-free formulations exerted no significant impact on mucosal cells, suggesting they are safe for vaginal delivery.

ID OLIGONUCLEOTIDE AS1411; NUCLEOLIN
AB Nucleic acid aptamers can specifically bind to target molecules on the cell membrane that mediate their entrance into the cells. Their small size, high binding affinity, specificity, good biocompatibility, stability and low immunogenicity make them ideal drug delivery systems for cancer therapy. These biopharmaceuticals have potential for the delivery of anticancer compounds to diseased tissues, increasing their effectiveness while mitigating the off-target toxicity towards healthy cells. Herein, we have studied two quadruplex-forming DNA sequences derived from the nucleolin-targeted aptamer AS1411 as supramolecular carriers for the cancer-selective delivery of acridine orange derivatives (C-3, C-5 and C-8) in cervical cancer cells.
   The devised delivery strategy relied on the non-covalent association of the acridine derivatives and the G-quadruplex (G4) structures. This association is done with a high binding strength, as suggested by the obtained K-D values in the 10(-6)-10(-7) M range, leading to the thermal stabilization of the G4 structures, particularly for C-8. The stability of the resulting supramolecular conjugates was evaluated in fetal bovine serum, which proved their resistance against serum nucleases up to 48 h. Previous studies showed that the tested acridine orange derivatives were cytotoxic towards cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and non-malignant cells. However, when conjugated to AS1411 derivatives, the cytotoxicity of the free ligands towards non-malignant cells was restrained. Furthermore, conjugated C-3 showed an enhanced cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells. Confocal microscopy indicated that both G4 sequences appear to colocalize with nucleolin, suggesting their ability to recognize and bind nucleolin on the cell surface. Additionally, the results confirmed the internalization of these delivery systems into HeLa cancer cells and their sustained cell trafficking, although being able to dissociate in-tracellularly to deliver C-8 to the nucleoli. Overall, we showed that AS1411-derived G4s can be used as a potential cancer drug delivery system for cervical cancer.

TI Development of microparticles for controlled release of resveratrol to
   adipose tissue and the impact of drug loading on particle morphology and

AB Resveratrol is a small molecule produced by various plants with a remarkable range of beneficial functions in animals. One of these is stimulating signaling pathways in adipose tissue that protect against obesity. Unfortunately, resveratrol suffers from poor bioavailability that inhibits its accumulation in target tissues, including fat, thus hindering the realization of its therapeutic potential. To address this, we are developing biodegradable microparticles as drug depots for controlled release of resveratrol within fat. In this study, resveratrol was encapsulated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles using an oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation technique. The oil phase consisted of resveratrol and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) dissolved in a mixture of dichloromethane and ethanol; meanwhile, the aqueous phase contained poly(vinyl alcohol) as the emulsifier. Increasing ethanol's volume ratio increased resveratrol's solubility in the oil phase and particle drug loading. The maximal loading achieved was 65 mu g/mg (6.5%) and occurred when the ethanol to dichloromethane ratio was 1:3. Under these conditions, particles exhibited ruffled surfaces, which resulted in variable drug release over the first three days of a six-week release assay. By decreasing resveratrol and ethanol in the oil phase and increasing poly (vinyl alcohol) in the aqueous phase, smooth particles were achieved, but they suffered a 15-25-fold decrease in drug loading depending on size. Small particles exhibited higher drug loading and burst drug release compared to larger particles because of their higher specific surface area. Utilizing mild chemistry, we functionalized poly(vinyl alcohol) with fluorescein isothiocyanate and demonstrated that encapsulation of resveratrol in the particle decreases the amount of fluorescent polymer on the particle surface, suggesting resveratrol displaces the emulsifier during particle formation. Taken together, resveratrol can be encapsulated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles, but it accumulates at the particle surface impacting drug loading, surface roughness, and drug release.

AB Covering the surface of a nanoparticle with polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a common way to prevent non-specific interactions but how its presence impacts on the activity of targeting ligands is still poorly documented. We synthesized a set of 9 silica nanoparticles grafted with c[RGDfK]-, a peptide targeting integrin alpha(v)beta(3) (cRGD), and/or with ATWLPPR, an anti-neuropilin 1 peptide (ATW). We then added various PEGs, and studied NPs binding on primary endothelial cells, the downstream activated signaling pathways and the impact on apoptosis. Our results show that the presence of PEG2000 on cRGD/ATW nanoparticles moderately improves cell binding but induces a 6000 times augmentation of AKT-dependent cell response due to the recruitment of other Receptor Tyrosine Kinases. Augmenting the length of the spacer that separates the peptides from the silica (using PEG3000) mainly resulted in a loss of specificity. Finally, the PEG-mediated hyperactivation of AKT did not protect endothelial cell from dying in the absence of serum, while its moderate activation obtained without PEG did. Finally, PEGylation of cRGD/ATW-NPs can generate nanoparticles with potent capacities to activate the AKT-GSK3 beta-eNOS cascade and to affect the resistance of endothelial cells to apoptosis. Thus, the impact of PEGylation should be precisely considered in order to avoid the apparition of counter-productive biological responses.

AB Oral ulcer is one common mucosal disease with high prevalence. Here, capsaicin candies were prepared based on the stereolithographically (SLA) 3D printed molds. The molds can be freely designed depending on the needs of patients, involving symmetric shapes (e.g., round, four-lead clover and cube), asymmetric shapes (e.g., car) and various color (e.g., blue, red and yellow). A two-part-combined mold was filled with the xylitol-based material and separated to obtain hard candies. Capsaicin was amorphous in the candies according to the differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. Poloxamer 188 improved the release of capsaicin from the candies. Rat oral ulcer models were established on the tongue with phenol liquids. The blank candy, 0.05% capsaicin candy and dexamethasone were respectively administered on the ulcer once daily. On Day 7, a healing rate of 97.8% was achieved by the capsaicin candy, much higher than those in the other groups. Moreover, the blank candy also showed the remarkable ulcer healing effect due to the presence of xylitol and poloxamer. Capsaicin remarkably enhanced the reepithelialization of ulcer tissues and showed strong anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the expressions of THF-alpha and IL-6. 3D printing-based capsaicin candies provide an interesting therapeutic choice for the people with oral ulcer.

AB Designing potent and safe-of-use therapies against cancers and infections remains challenging despite the emergence of novel molecule classes like checkpoint inhibitors or Toll-Like-Receptor ligands. The latest therapeutic perspectives under development for immune modulator administration exploits vectorization, and biodegradable delivery systems are one of the most promising vehicles. Nanoparticles based on Poly (D,L) Lactic Acid (PLA) as polymer for formulation are widely investigated due to its bioresorbable, biocompatible and low immunogen properties. We propose a PLA-based nanoparticle delivery system to vectorize Pam(3)CSK(4), a lipopeptide TLR1/2 ligand and a potent activator of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa B that shows a self-assembling behavior from 30 mu g/mL onwards. We demonstrate successful encapsulation of Pam(3)CSK(4) in PLA nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation in a 40-180 mu g/mL concentration range, with 99% of entrapment efficiency. By molecular modelling, we characterize drug/carrier interactions and conclude that Pam(3)CSK(4) forms clusters onto the nanoparticle and is not encapsulated into the hydrophobic core. In silico predictions provide nanoprecipitation optimization and the mechanistic understanding of the particle dynamics. The loaded-Pam(3)CSK(4) maintains bioactivity on TLR2, confirmed by in vitro experiments using reporter cell line HEK-Blue hTLR2. Our presented data and results are convincing evidence that Pam(3)CSK(4)-loaded in PLA nanoparticles represent a promising immune modulating system.

AB Magnesium stearate is an extremely common pharmaceutical excipient and the measurement of BET surface area via nitrogen adsorption is undertaken during pharmaceutical formulation and manufacture. In this paper, four commercial magnesium stearate materials in mono- and di-hydrated forms are analysed by nitrogen and krypton adsorption for the calculation of BET surface area. BET surface area via nitrogen adsorption is shown to be erroneously high due to a structural swelling and adsorbate encapsulation effect occurring throughout the BET range and which should preclude the use of BET theory. However, with krypton adsorption this effect commences at higher adsorption pressures and it is possible to calculate BET surface area which better represents the true surface area of the material. The disparity between nitrogen and krypton adsorption is greater for the dihydrate form: the mean average BET surface area of 10 samples from the same di-hydrate containing batch are 23.18 m(2) g(-1) via nitrogen adsorption and 6.78 m(2) g(-1) via krypton. It is also shown than the standard deviation of BET surface area across 10 analyses of each of the four batches is considerably lower via krypton adsorption. Finally, an analytical protocol for krypton adsorption onto magnesium stearate for BET surface area measurement is established.

AB Many topical drug products are multi-phase systems which are prone to phase separation exhibiting a high risk for not meeting the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of a pharmaceutical product such as uniform active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) distribution and physical homogeneity. In order to investigate and control these CQAs a rheological temperature sweeping (RTS) method was implemented and refined to enable quantification of these characteristics within a quality by design (QbD) approach. For method implementation, emulsion and ointment compositions were prepared within a design of experiments (DoE) and critical responses from RTS were extracted via principal component analysis (PCA) in a multivariate data analysis (MVA) approach. The span after 3 cycles of RTS on emulsions and a combination of 5 principal components (PCs) for ointments were selected as responses from PCA. The span correlates with the droplet size of selected emulsions followed during stability whereas the combination of the PCs for ointments enables a differentiation of the compositions. Identified critical material attributes (CMAs) are the emulsifier concentration of the emulsion and the liquid paraffin (LP) content of the ointments. In conclusion, RTS enables a rapid screening of liquid and semi-solid products in a quantitative manner for pharmaceutical development and formulation optimization.

AB Imatinib (IMT) is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor clinically used for treating chronic myeloid leukemia and malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. However, oral administration of IMT is challenged by its high oral dose, low intestinal solubility and adverse reactions. This work aimed to investigate the effect of galactose ligand on polymeric nanoparticles-facilitated oral absorption of IMT. N-oleoyl-D-galactosamine was synthesized for fabricating biomimetic galactose-modified nanoparticles (GNPs) in an attempt to improve the oral bioavailability of IMT. IMT-loaded GNPs (IMT-GNPs) were prepared using a solvent diffusion technique and characterized by particle size, morphology, and entrapment efficiency (EE). The in vitro release and in vivo oral bioavailability of IMT-GNPs were comparatively studied with bulk IMT and IMT-loaded nanoparticles (IMT-NPs), respectively. The resultant IMT-GNPs were 122.0 nm around in particle size with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.201. IMT-GNPs possessed a high EE (93.06%) and exhibited a sustained effect on drug release. After oral administration, IMT-GNPs significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of IMT, up to 152.3% relative to IMT suspensions, whereas IMT-NPs merely resulted in an increase to 115.2%. Cellular uptake and ex vivo intestinal transport imaging demonstrated that GNPs were armed with higher cellular affinity and intestinal epithelial permeability compared with galactose-free IMT-NPs. These results provide solid evidence that galactose modification has great potential to ulteriorly promote the oral absorption of IMT on the base of nanoparticles, which may be conducive to achieve the synergy and attenuation of IMT.

AB Implants offer the opportunity to improve patient adherence and real-world outcomes. However, most polymers used today are hydrophobic and limit drug properties suitable for development. Thermoplastic poly(urethanes) (TPUs) form pores upon hydration and may facilitate the development of implants containing drugs exhibiting broadly different properties. We sought to investigate the effect of drug physicochemical properties on permeability through membranes of varying TPU mixture composition; leverage imaging to visualize microstructural changes to the membrane across the TPU mixture composition range; and quantitatively characterize the membrane microstructure using equivalent pore analysis. We observed a correlation between drug hydrophobicity and its permeability through hydrophobic-rich TPU membranes. Conversely, all compounds diffused through hydrophilic-rich TPU membranes at similar rates, regardless of drug properties. Imaging revealed significant microstructure differences between hydrophobic-rich and hydrophilic-rich TPU membranes, supporting hypotheses proposed in our previous study. The hydrated hydrophilic TPU membrane pore area was determined to be 0.583% and its equivalent pore radius was found to be 128 nm, suggesting that hydrophilic TPU membranes may be used to modify the release of small molecular weight drugs and macromolecules. These findings highlight the benefits of hydrophilic TPUs as rate-controlling membranes to modulate the release rate of drugs with varying physicochemical properties.

AB Co-jet-milling drugs and lubricants may enable simultaneous particle size reduction and surface coating to achieve satisfactory aerosolization performance. This study aims to establish the relationship between surface lubricant coverage and aerosolization behavior of a model drug (ciprofloxacin HCl) co-jet-milled with lubricants [magnesium stearate (MgSt) or L-leucine]. The co-jet-milled formulations were characterized for particle size, morphology, cohesion, Carr's index, and aerosolization performance. The surface lubricant coating was assessed by probing surface chemical composition using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The effects of co-jet-milling on the surface energy and in vitro dissolution of ciprofloxacin were also evaluated. Our results indicated that, in general, the ciprofloxacin co-jetmilled with L-leucine at > 0.5% w/w showed a significant higher fine particle fraction (FPF) compared with the ciprofloxacin jet-milled alone. The FPF values plateau at or above 5% w/w for both MgSt and L-leucine. We have established the quantitative correlations between surface lubricant coverage and aerosolization in the tested range for each of the lubricants. More importantly, our results suggest different mechanisms to improve aerosolization for MgSt-coating and L-leucine-coating, respectively: MgSt-coating reduces inter-particulate interactions through the formation of low surface energy coating films, while L-leucine-coating not only reduces the surface energy but also creates rough particle surfaces that reduce inter-particulate contact area. Furthermore, surface coatings with 5% w/w MgSt (which is hydrophobic) did not lead to substantial changes in in vitro dissolution. Our findings have shown that the coating structure/quality and their effects could be highly dependent on the process and the coating material. The findings from this mechanistic study provide fundamental understanding of the critical effects of MgSt and L-leucine surface coverages on aerosolization and powder flow properties of inhalation particles.

AB The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of formulation variables on the drying of nanocrystalline suspensions either via bead layering or spray granulation and develop mini-tablets from the dried nanocrystalline powders. Irbesartan (crystalline Form B), a poorly soluble drug substance was chosen as a model compound. An optimized irbesartan nanocrystalline suspension with a mean particle size of 300 nm was utilized for the downstream processing. Irbesartan nanocrystalline suspension was dried either by layering onto the microcrystalline cellulose beads (i.e. 200 or 500 mu m) or by granulation (mannitol or microcrystalline cellulose as substrates) at two different drug loadings (i.e. 10% or 30% w/w). Smaller size beads layered with nanocrystals resulted in faster dissolution profiles compared to larger size beads at both the studied drug loadings (i.e. 10 and 30% w/w). Mannitol granules containing irbesartan nanocrystals resulted in faster dissolution profiles compared to microcrystalline cellulose granules. Microcrystalline cellulose beads and mannitol granules containing irbesartan nanocrystals (i.e. 30% w/w drug loading) were further compressed into mini-tablets. Mini-tablets retained fast drug dissolution characteristics of the dried powders. The results from this study indicated that the spray granulation is a superior drying approach compared to bead layering for drying of irbesartan nanocrystalline suspension and mini-tablet development.

AB Nanocrystalline suspensions offer a promising approach to improve the dissolution rate of BCS Class II/IV drugs and hence oral bioavailability. Irbesartan (crystalline Form B), a poorly soluble drug substance was chosen as a model compound for the study. The objectives of the study were to formulate Irbesartan nanocrystalline suspension via media milling, study the effects of process and formulation variables on particle size reduction, and evaluate bead layering or spray granulation as drying processes. A Design of Experiment approach was utilized to understand the impact of formulation variables on particle size reduction via media milling. Drug concentration and type of stabilizer were found to be significant in particle size reduction. Optimized Irbesartan nanocrystalline suspension (i.e. at 10% w/w with 1% w/w poloxamer 407) showed superior in vitro dissolution profile compared to unmilled suspension. Optimized Irbesartan nanocrystalline suspension was converted into dried powders either by bead layering (with microcrystalline cellulose) or by spray granulation (either with mannitol or microcrystalline cellulose). DSC and PXRD studies revealed that Irbesartan remained crystalline post drying. Microcrystalline cellulose beads layered with Irbesartan nanocrystals showed about 65% drug dissolution within the first 10 min of dissolution study. Mannitol granules containing Irbesartan nanocrystals were fast dissolving (i.e. >90% drug dissolution within 10 min) compared to microcrystalline cellulose granules (i.e. approx. 46% drug dissolution within 10 min). Irbesartan nanocrystalline suspension had the fastest dissolution rates (i.e. > 90% drug dissolution in two minutes) followed by mannitol-based granules containing dried Irbesartan nanocrystals (i.e. > 90% drug dissolution in ten minutes).

ID FIBERS; SCAFFOLD
AB Stem cells with their intrinsic ability to differentiate to specific cell types have been clinically used as the most promising cell therapy. However, the injection-based administration in most clinical trials shows cell retention rates as low as 1% within days of transplantation. Herein, core-shell nanofibers of PLCL (Poly(lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)) and Gelatin-Methacrylate (Gel-MA), respectively, were fabricated to support the 3D delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The core-shell ratios can be accurately controlled using coaxial electrospinning, achieving smooth sliding fibers with up to 85 wt% of Gel-MA shell. Different core-shell flow rate ratios were systematically investigated. Either an increase of the concentration of the core PLCL solution or an increase of core solution flow rate can lead to an increase of the fiber diameter from 0.26 mu m to 1.38 mu m, and a decrease of numbers of beads from 33 per 100 fibers to bead-free. Significantly enhanced hMSCs proliferation (similar to 2 folds over 7 days) on the three dimensional (3D) core-shell fibers were observed compared to that on 2D culture. Moreover, hMSCs cellularized 3D core-shell fibers can be directly injected as 4 cm(2) meshes through a catheter, with an 80% viable retention after injection, indicating their great promise in advancing stem cell therapy by both improving viable retention and meanwhile allowing minimally invasive administration.

AB In the present study the application of near-infrared chemical imaging (NIR-CI) for assessing particle segregation in granules from continuous twin screw granulation (TSG) granules, were the complex attributes of the machinery configuration in relation to particle segregation is not well understood was investigated. Experiments were performed along the compartmental length of the TSG barrel channel by varying the screw element type and liquid binder viscosity. Examination of the data showed a direct correlation between dispersion due to shear force and de-mixing of particles, which allowed for identification of fundamental granule segregation mechanisms affecting content uniformity in TSG. Particle segregation behavior was linked to dispersion due to shear force through a proposed regime mapping approach which links de-mixing potential to controlling granule formation mechanisms with a new dimensionless mixing number. This was carried out in order to provide a general guideline of how particles segregate along the length of the TSG barrel channel.

AB Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a localized treatment strategy used for skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the second most common form of skin cancer. PDT combines a photosensitizer, laser source and tissue oxygen. In this study, the selected photosensitizer, ferrous chlorophyllin (Fe-CHL) was loaded in ethosomes and lipid coated chitosan (PC/CHI) nanocarriers to enhance skin delivery of Fe-CHL for potential PDT of squamous carcinoma.
   The nanocarrier formulations were characterized and studied for their skin retention and penetration depth of Fe-CHL across mouse skin ex vivo using high performance liquid chromatography and confocal microscopy. Confocal microscope images of mouse skin showed deeper penetration of ethosomes down to the dermis when compared to PC/CHI that was confined to the epidermis, although they showed no significant difference in skin retention. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with ki67 and TUNEL show maintained skin structure and no cytotoxic effects of the nanocarrier gel formulations before laser exposure to mouse skin.
   The nanocarriers were also studied for their PDT effect against human SCC monolayer and three-dimensional (3-D) spheroids. When compared to ethosomes, PC/CHI showed higher cytotoxicity in MTT assay and live confocal microscopy showed cell disintegration after laser exposure. For 3-D spheroids, PC/CHI also showed higher cytotoxicity using acid phosphatase assay and a decrease in spheroid size was observed using light microscopy.
   In conclusion, both types of nanocarriers can be used for their potential treatment of SCC using PDT depending on the tumour localization in the skin.

AB Due to the toxicity and resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs, various methods are used to improve their efficacy in cancer treatment. In this present study, in order to overcome the limitation of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), prodrug strategy has been pursued with using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulation (MDs). The main objective of this study is to examine the mechanisms of drug release from its prodrug form by using the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations. The reaction mechanisms of 5-FU prodrug (EMC-5-FU) in the presence of lactic acid (LA) and water molecule were theoretically studied. The IRC calculations were carried out at the M06-2X/6-311G** level in the aqueous phase through the mechanism of ester hydrolysis to obtain energies, the geometry optimization of all stationary points along the potential energy surfaces (PES), and also to determine the harmonic vibrational frequencies. The results herein presented suggest that three reaction pathways and transition states TS1 to TS2 are involved along the calculated potential energy surface. We found that the drug molecule is released in the third step and this occurs by separation CH2O group in the presence of water molecule with the highest energy barrier about 25.9 kcal/mol. Since the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can act as drug delivery vehicles and deliver anticancer drugs directly to the target cells. Therefore in DFT section, the interaction mechanism of CNTs with 5-FU prodrug is studied by means of DFT method. The atoms in molecules (AIM) and the non-covalent interactions (NCI) between the CNTs and prodrug are used in order to examine the strength and type of interaction between them. The result of negative binding energy values of CNT-prodrug interaction show the stability of these complexes. Our theoretical results show that the more favorable interaction occurs when the prodrug is located inside the carbon nanotube. Furthermore, for design and development of intracellular drug delivery systems, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations was used to investigate the possibility of encapsulated prodrug-CNT penetration through a (1-palmitoyl-2oleoyl phosphatidylcholine) POPC lipid bilayer. For this purpose, the forces of penetration and the free energies of rupture of POPC bilayer with a Prodrug-CNT were studied. Our simulation results show that encapsulated prodrug-carbon nanotube does not permanently destroy the POPC membrane structure.

AB Blending two polymers is an effective technique to obtain a novel material with desirable properties. Chitosan (CH) has limited applications in tissue engineering owing to its poor mechanical strength in a wet state. Polycaprolactone (PCL) has low toxicity with good mechanical strength and controlled release properties, but lack cell recognition signals. Thus, the blending of CH and PCL (CH/PCL) polymers would provide a better biomaterial required for the management of chronic osteomyelitis (OM) after surgical debridement possessing superior physicomechanical and controlled release properties. Herein, blend sponges using different ratios of CH and PCL, i.e., 100% CH/00%PCL, 75%CH/25%PCL, 50%CH/50%PCL and 25%CH/75%PCL were prepared, which are denoted as 100CH/00PCL, 75CH/25PCL, 50CH/50PCL and 25CH/75PCL, respectively. These blend sponges were characterized using FTIR, XRD, DSC, SEM, and contact angle. The results revealed that CH and PCL polymers were well dispersed in a blend at a molecular level without any chemical interactions. Blend sponges were loaded with ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CIP) and ibuprofen. Further, in vitro efficacy of drug-loaded blend sponges was evaluated for drug release, antibacterial potential, and anti-inflammatory activity. Amongst four blend sponges, the 75CH/25PCL sponge demonstrated the controlled release of ibuprofen and an ideal release profile of CIP along with potential antibacterial as well as anti-inflammatory activity over the study period. Thus, it can be concluded that the 75CH/25PCL sponge is a promising candidate for the management of chronic OM after surgical debridement.

AB Glucan particles (GPs) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are hollow shells that are composed mainly of beta-1,3-D-glucan, which has demonstrated immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory potential both in vitro and in vivo. Curcumin is a natural hydrophobic phenolic compound, which possesses a significant anti-inflammatory effect and is used as supportive therapy in the treatment of many inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible synergic effect and other benefits of the co-application of GPs and curcumin in the form of pharmaceutical composites. GP/curcumin composites were prepared using controlled evaporation of the organic solvent and their anti-oxidative effect and anti-inflammatory potential were tested on THP1-XBlue (TM)-MD2-CD14 human monocytes cell line. The anti-oxidative effect was measured on pyocyanin-stimulated cells in vitro and the NF-kappa B/AP-1 signaling pathway on lipopolysaccharide pre-treated monocytes was chosen for anti-inflammatory assays. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was evaluated as well. Results mostly showed a pro-oxidative activity of empty GPs, however, pharmaceutical composites demonstrated an anti-oxidative effect. The activity of NF-kappa B/AP-1 was substantially decreased by the tested GP/curcumin composites, which also caused the attenuation of cytokines secretion. The obtained results indicate a beneficial effect of the incorporation of curcumin into GPs.

ID LIQUID JET; SKIN; PENETRATION; IMPACT
AB In this study, needle-free jet injection dynamics were studied using homogeneous gelatin as model substrates. Whilst keeping nozzle properties such as orifice diameter (do) and ampoule volume (V) constant, we demonstrate the effect of standoff (s), confinement around the gel, storage modulus (G') of model gel and liquid viscosity (mu) on the penetration depth of the jet injection. High-speed imaging was used to observe the liquid jet propagation and dispersion dynamics, whilst a load cell was implemented to measure the impact force for different standoff distance and viscosity of the liquid. The different parameters considered showed significant effects on penetration depth, with non-linear dependence on standoff being the key result, which may have implications for future injector designs. Moreover, the effect of confinement serves as a caution of using gelatin substrates as a proxy for human tissue.

AB In drug formulations, cyclodextrins are used to increase aqueous solubility and chemical stability of drugs via formation of inclusion complexes. For ionizable drug molecules, the complexation strength depends on pH. Increased ionization leads to a more soluble drug, but also results in destabilization of cyclodextrin complexes. Therefore, formulation scientists aim to find a balance between increased drug solubility and high complexation strength. In this work, a theoretical expression for the dependency between the stability constant and pH is presented, allowing the accurate prediction of the stability constant at any pH. The theoretical expression requires three out of four input parameters; the pK(a) of the free guest molecule, the pK(a) of the complex, and the stability constants for the neutral and fully ionized complex. Stability constants for beta-cyclodextrin and ibuprofen complexes were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry at seven pH values (2.5-5.5) and four temperatures (15-55 degrees C). All these measured stability constants complied with the theoretical expression. Ten additional data sets from the literature comprising eight different drug molecules and three different cyclodextrins confirmed the ability of the theoretical expression to account for the observed pH-dependence of stability constants.

AB Water solubility has been identified as a critical parameter and the main responsible by affecting poor performance of oral drug delivery. Poorly soluble drugs can originate unsatisfactory ADME properties leading to low oral bioavailability, insufficient chemical stability, low half-life, fast pre-systemic metabolism and difficulties in formulation. In this context, the prodrug design is an alternative in order to improve physicochemical, bio-pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties such as permeability, solubility, bioavailability, chemical stability and metabolism of molecules presenting poor drug-like properties. In this article we highlight the importance of the prodrug design in the early stages of drug discovery and development process, in an attempt to diminish the attrition rate and end up falling into the valley of death. Selected examples of this strategy are provided in this review and they are classified by some basic functional groups that are amenable to the prodrug approach with the aim of increasing aqueous solubility of poorly water-soluble compounds. Over the past decade, the number of approved prodrugs is considerable among all drugs launched in the market, emphasizing the importance of this tool on drug design. It is reported that 10% of all marketed drug worldwide can be classified as prodrugs. Furthermore, prodrugs designed to be more water soluble launched in the past decade are summarized in a table to have a closer look and finally state that the prodrug design is an amenable approach to increase water solubility.

AB This study aims at identifying the more suitable polysaccharide in a composite film based on Eudragit RS for 5-ASA delivery to the colon. Different polysaccharides (pectin, chitosan, guar, inulin, and dextran) were examined. The mechanical properties, swelling index, loss of film mass and permeability of films to 5-ASA were recorded at simulating gastric (SGF), intestinal (SIF) and colonic fluids (SCF). Films containing inulin or dextran were more flexible and showed better mechanical properties. Films containing chitosan, pectin or guar exhibited extensive swelling in SGF and SIF. Loss of film mass and drug permeation was more pronounced in SCF than SIF for all samples indicating their sensitivity to colonic bacteria. However, films containing inulin or dextran showed minimum swelling index in SGF and SIF and the highest ratio of permeability in SCF to SIF. Accordingly, inulin and dextran are suggested as appropriate polysaccharides in a film based on Eudragit RS for colon delivery of 5-ASA.

AB CPT-11 is a first-line chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancers. 7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), the active metabolite of CPT-11, has an anticancer efficacy 100-1000 folds more than CPT-11 in vitro. However, the drawbacks such as ultralow solubility and poor stability, greatly limit the clinical applications of SN38. Recently, SN38-based nanomedicines have greatly improved the pharmaceutical and therapeutic characteristics of SN38. In addition, these nanosized delivery systems can target tumor tissues via the EPR effect and/or active-targeting strategies, thereby significantly improving anticancer efficacy, reducing side effects and reversing drug resistance. This review focuses on the advances of nano-delivery systems for SN38. We categorize the published studies into two groups, physical encapsulation and chemical conjugation, for the development of SN38 nano-delivery systems, and particularly summarize those for active tumor targeting. The advantages and shortcomings of current SN38 nano-delivery systems, aiming to develop more potent SN38 nano-delivery systems, are also discussed.

AB Some recent studies have shown that pirfenidone (PFD) has favorable results in the healing process of the cornea. However, PFD in solution exhibits short half-life after topical application, and in this context, a liquid crystal nanoparticle system containing PFD (PFD-LCNPs) was developed. The nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, small angle X-ray diffraction and polarized light microscopy. The PFD-LCNPs had particle size and zeta potential of 247.3 nm and -33.60 mV (stores at 4 degrees C), respectively, and 257.5 nm and -46.00 mV (stored at 25 degrees C), respectively. The pH of the formulation was 6.9 and the encapsulation efficiency was 35.9%. The in vitro release profiles indicated that PFD sustained release from PFD-LCNPs for up to 12 h. In vitro study of ocular irritation (HET-CAM test) concluded that components of the formulation are well tolerated for ocular administration. Corneal re-epithelialization time after chemical burning was significantly reduced in rabbits treated with PFD-loaded LCNPs when compared to the group treated with a vehicle. In addition, the anti-inflammatory action of pirfenidone was observed by reducing myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and inflammatory cells in the histology of the tissues of animals treated with PFD-LCNPs. These findings indicated that the PFD-LCNPs might have the potential for effective ocular drug delivery.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the world, mainly due to distant metastases events. The metastatic CRC (mCRC) stages are resistant to the therapeutic recommended. Therefore, it urges the development of more efficient strategies to impair the disease. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a well-known silencing tool with impact on targeted cancer therapy, even though in vivo challenges difficult its clinical application. Here, multiple solutions to overcome the extracellular and intracellular barriers encountered by intravenous delivery of siRNA are discussed. Moreover, it is emphasized the association of siRNA with nanoparticles to enable the long-term release and to counteract the toxicity issues of siRNA. Particular attention is paid on the potential of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles for systemic siRNA delivery in mCRC. Despite of being less used so far due to technological difficulties, multiple strategies to successfully encapsulate siRNA into PLGA nanocarriers are summarized.

AB Pharmaceutical containers for parenterals have been predominantly manufactured using glass as a packaging material of choice, especially Type-I glass, since it has been regarded as a chemically inert and an effective container closure system (CCS). Nevertheless, there have been reports and recalls related to glass quality issues, such as breakage, flakes, and particles observed in marketed products. The novelty of this research is based on the knowledge gathered from our previously conducted risk assessments and establishing a comprehensive testing platform focused on risk factors for glass container failure modes and applicability to other types of pharmaceutical containers. The evaluation of container quality attributes was performed for three model glass vials using a mechanical and chemical durability testing platform: freeze-thaw, lyophilization, compression, scratch tests; visual inspection, pH, particle size analyses, extractable, leachable and imaging studies that were conducted under normal (4 and 25 degrees C), and stress condition (60 degrees C), respectively. The performance between the glass containers tested under certain stress conditions (failure modes) were variable and differentiated. The systematic platform testing approach shows the importance of lab-based risk evaluation in assessing common failure modes of pharmaceutical containers, since the quality attributes for injectable products are complex and can impact final product quality.

AB Development of topically administered drug delivery systems for the treatment of ocular diseases have majorly focused on enhancing bioavailability of drugs in the ocular tissues. However, control of spatial distribution of topically administered drugs so as to restrict/avoid drug bioavailability at sensitive ocular tissues that are prone to drug induced adverse effects has not been explored. In this study, we aimed to reduce the bioavailability of topically administered corticosteroid, triamcinolone acetonide (TA) in lens via controlled spatial distribution in order to minimize TA induced posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC). For this, a negatively charged polymeric core-shell nanoparticulate drug delivery system composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) core and pluronic (R) F-68 (PF68) shell was fabricated. For in vivo studies, coumarin-6 (COU) loaded nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated and studied for their biodistribution after topical administration in mice eyes and compared with free COU biodistribution. The administered COU loaded NPs differentially distributed in mice eyes and showed lower bioavailability in lens compared to free COU. Further, in vivo efficacy of the delivery system for its ability to minimize the rate of PSC progression was evaluated in diabetic rats. The results demonstrated that TA loaded PCL-PF68 NPs decreased PSC progression compared to free TA when administered topically.

AB Most antibody-based therapies for AML target a single antigen on the surface of AML cells, which has a limited clinical benefit due to unsatisfied targeting ability and antigen-negative escape. Here we described the development and specific targeting of daunorubicin (DNR)-loaded CD123/CD33 dual-antibody modified liposome, CD123/CD33-LP-DNR. Since the majority of AML cells carries at least one of the antigens of CD123 and CD33, it is promising to treat AML using the dual-targeting agents. In this study, antibody mixture of CD123 and CD33 (1: 1, molar ratio) were thiolated and coupled to Mal-PEG2000-DSPE, then the antibody-Mal-PEG2000-DSPE conjugations were inserted on the DNR-loaded PEGylated liposomes (PEG-LP-DNR) via a post insertion method to prepare CD123/CD33-LP-DNR (antibody/S100PC, molar ratio, 0.06%). The cellular uptake and cytotoxicity were evaluated in THP-1 (CD123(bright)CD33(bright)) and HL-60 (CD123(dim)CD33(bright)) cells. Compared to the unmodified liposome, CD123/CD33-LP-DNR showed higher cellular uptake which was 1.8-times and 1.6-times in both THP-1 and HL-60 cells, respectively, while the cellular uptake increased to 1.5-times only in the CD123(bright) cells for the single-antibody modified liposome, CD123-LP-DNR. MTT assay indicated stronger cytotoxicity of CD123/CD33-LP-DNR than CD123-LP-DNR on AML cells. The results indicated that CD123/CD33-LP-DNR might present an effective delivery strategy to enhance the targeting ability against AML cells and potentially reduce the antigen-negative escape.

The aim of the current study is the fabrication of unique suppository shell molds composed of a water-soluble polymer (polyvinylalcohol) using a fused deposition modeling-type 3D printer so that hospital pharmacists can prepare tailored suppository formulations containing progesterone (a model drug for vaginal suppository formulations) in future clinical settings. Suppository formulations with holes in the shells were prepared. The drug release profiles related well to the positions of the holes (upper, middle, lower), the number of holes (0-2 holes), and the diameters of the holes (0-5 mm) in the suppositories. Matryoshka-type suppository formulations composed of 3D-printed multilayered shells were then prepared. The drug release profiles showed pulsed release, and the volumes of the inner/outer spaces in the suppository shells (1/1, 1/3) and the drug concentration (3/1, 1/1) were reflected in the observed drug release profiles. Our study indicates that a 3D printer can produce not only unique and complex suppository formulations, but also provides flexibility and expands possible applications for the development of tailored medicine.

AB We characterize amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) of the Chloramphenicol antibiotic in two biodegradable polylactic acid polymers, namely a commercial sample of enantiomeric pure PLLA and a home-synthesized PDLLA copolymer, investigating in particular the effect of polylactic acid in stabilizing the amorphous form of the drug and controlling its release (e.g. for antitumoral purposes). Broadband dielectric spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry are employed to study the homogeneity, glass transition temperature and relaxation dynamics of solvent-casted ASD membranes with different drug concentrations. We observe improved physical stability of the ASDs with respect to the pure drug, as well as a plasticizing effect of the antibiotic on the polymer, well described by the Gordon-Taylor equation. The release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient from the films in a simulated body fluid is studied by UV/vis spectroscopy at two different drug concentrations (5 and 20% in weight). The amount of released drug is found to be proportional to the square root of time, with proportionality constant that is almost the same in both dispersions, despite the fact that the relaxation time and thus the viscosity of the two samples differ by four orders of magnitude at body temperature. Since the drug release kinetics does not display a significant dependence on the drug content in the carrier, it may be expected to remain roughly constant during longer release times.

AB Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) requires the use of contrast agents (CAs) to enable accurate diagnosis. There are currently no CAs on the market with appropriate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, namely long persistence in the blood, that can be easily used for MRA. We have recently synthesized amphiphilic building blocks loaded with gadolinium (Gd), which self-assemble into Gd-micelles in aqueous media, and have evaluated their potential as a blood-pool contrast agent (BPCA) in vivo. To assess the short and long term PK of Gd-micelles, the blood and organs of the mice were analyzed at t = 30 min, 1, 2, 3 h, 7, 14 and 21 days. Gd-DOTA was used as a control because it is the gold-standard CA for MRA despite its rapid clearance from the blood compartment. Gd-micelles circulated in the blood for more than 3 h postinjection whereas Gd-DOTA was eliminated less than half an hour postinjection. No side effects were observed in the mice up to the end of the study at 21 days and no accumulation of Gd was observed in the brain or bones. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) parameters and the results of this in vivo study indicate the true BCPA properties of Gd-micelles and warrant further development.

AB Protein pharmaceuticals have become a significant class of marketed drug products and are expected to grow steadily over the next decade. Development of a commercial protein product is, however, a rather complex process. A critical step in this process is formulation development, enabling the final product configuration. A number of challenges still exist in the formulation development process. This review is intended to discuss these challenges, to illustrate the basic formulation development processes, and to compare the options and strategies in practical formulation development.

AB Rapamycin as a novel macrolide immunosuppressive agent has been commonly used in organ transplantation owing to its stronger immunosuppressive effect, non-nephrotoxicity and lower side effect. However its drawbacks of low bioavailability and big individual difference remain to be improved in clinical application. Here rapamycin loaded TPGS-Lecithins-Zein nanoparticles (RTLZ-NPs) with core-shell structure were prepared by the phase separation method. The RTLZ-NPs were approximately 190.3 nm in size, with PDI and zeta potential about 0.256 and -19.71 mV respectively. Drug entrapment and loading achieved were about 86.64 and 25.73% respectively. Meanwhile RTLZ-NPs exhibited favorable enzymolysis resistance abilities in gastrointestinal environments and enhanced uptake in Caco-2 cells. The optimum absorption sites of rapamycin in the intestine were duodenum and jejunum as single-pass intestinal perfusion assay. Upon also considering the results of Caco-2 cell assay, it could be speculated that the transport of rapamycin in vivo involved active transport as well as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) based efflux. Finally, the relative oral bioavailability of RTLZ-NPS was 4.33 fold higher than free rapamycin in SD rat. Altogether the designed nanoparticles can be an efficient oral delivery strategy for rapamycin analogues to prevent the attacks from destructive enzymes, reduce cell efflux, increase cell uptake, and then enhance the oral bioavailability.

AB In this study we investigated the role of lncRNA MIR503HG in colorectal cancer (CRC). We found that MIR503HG was downregulated and TGF-beta 2 was upregulated in CRC included in this study. Low levels of MIR503HG were associated with poor survival of CRC patients within 5 years after admission. MIR503HG and TGF-beta 2 were inversely correlated in CRC tissues, and in CRC cells, MIR503HG overexpression was accompanied by TGF-beta 2 downregulation, while TGF-beta 2 overexpression did not affect MIR503HG. TGF-beta 2 overexpression mediated the increased migration and invasion rates of CRC cells. MIR503HG overexpression mediated the decreased migration and invasion rates of CRC cells. Moreover, TGF-beta 2 overexpression reduced the effects of MIR503HG overexpression. Therefore, MIR503HG overexpression inhibits CRC cell migration and invasion mediated by TGF-beta 2.

AB Background: Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies worldwide. Pelvic and abdominal metastasis is a leading cause for the poor prognosis of OvCa patients. The relationship between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and OvCa remains unclear. Identifying key lncRNAs related with OvCa metastasis is crucial for research on the mechanism of OvCa metastasis. This study was designed to investigate the role of a novel lncRNA, which we named SOCAR, in serous OvCa.
   Methods: LncRNA microarray and Real-time PCR were used to examine SOCAR expression in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and normal ovary tissues. The proliferation, migration and invasion of OvCa cell lines SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 were analyzed by CCK-8, Transwell and Scratch wound healing assays. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related proteins.
   Results: A novel serous OvCa-related lncRNA, SOCAR, was identified via microarray. SOCAR was overexpressed in primary HGSOC tumors compared with normal ovary tissues, and the expression of SOCAR correlated with progression in HGSOC patients. SOCAR also had higher expression in metastatic HGSOC tissues compared with primary cancer tissues. Moreover, upregulation of SOCAR promoted proliferation, migration and invasion in OvCa cells. Expression of Wnt1, beta-catenin and MMP-9 were all increased by SOCAR overexpression.
   Conclusion: SOCAR is related with HGSOC oncogenesis and progression. It may promote proliferation, migration and invasion in OvCa cells partially by upregulating MMP-9 through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

AB Naturally evolved saline tolerant rice landraces found along the coastline of India are a valuable genomic resource to explore the complex, polygenic nature of salinity tolerance. In the present study, a set of 28 genome wide SSR markers, 11 salt responsive genic SSR markers and 8 Saltol QTL linked SSR markers were used to estimate genetic relatedness and population structure within a collection of 47 rice landraces (including a tolerant and 2 sensitive checks) originating from geographically divergent coastal regions of India. All three marker types identified substantial genetic variation among the landraces, as evident from their higher PIC values (0.53 for genomic SSRs, 0.43 for Genic SSRs and 0.59 for Saltol SSRs). The markers RM431, RM484 (Genomic SSRs), OsCAX (D), OsCAX (T) (Genic SSRs) and RM562 (Sakai SSR) were identified as good candidates to be used in breeding programs for improving salinity tolerance in rice. STRUCTURE analysis divided the landraces into five distinct populations, with classification correlating with their geographical locations. Principal coordinate and hierarchical cluster analyses (UPGMA and neighbor joining) are in close agreement with STRUCTURE results. AMOVA analysis indicated a higher magnitude of genetic differentiation within individuals of groups (58%), than among groups (42%). We also report the development and validation of a new Cleavage Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS) marker (OsHKT1;5V395) that targets a codon in the sodium transporter gene OsHKT1;5 (Saltol/SKC1 locus) that is associated with sodium transport rates in the above rice landraces. The CAPS marker was found to be present in all landraces except in IR29, Kamini, Gheus, Matla 1 and Matla 2. Significant molecular genetic diversity established among the analyzed salt tolerant rice landraces will aid in future association mapping; the CAPS marker, OsHKT1;5V395 can be used to map rice landraces for the presence of the SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) associated with increased sodium transport rates and concomitant salinity tolerance in rice.

AB Rifampicin (RIF) is still a first line of antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial diseases, in particular the Mycobacterial infections. The antimicrobial activity of RIF is attributed to its ability to inhibit transcription by binding to the beta subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase (encoded by rpoB). Continued use of this drug resulted in the emergence of RIF resistant rpoB mutations in a high frequency that compels the use of RIF almost exclusively in drug combinations. As of date, a broad array of rif mutations have been isolated and characterized by different research groups. Studies on rpoB mutations strengthen the view that the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) is very crucial in modulating transcription thereby leading to differential gene expression. Very recently we have reported the transcriptome profile of rpoB12 mutant that provides molecular evidence that presence of rpoB12 mutation modulates the transcription of about 450 genes. Here we present a maiden report that rpoB mutations that substitute Tyr at the Rif binding pocket (RBP) of beta subunit of RNA polymerase are able to suppress the overproduction of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide (Ces phenotype) in Delta lon mutant of Escherichia coli. Further analyses of the rif mutants involving their growth pattern on LB at higher temperature (42 degrees C), LB media without NaCl, survival in LB media with acidic pH (pH - 3) and motility revealed that only rpoB12 (His526Tyr) and rpoB137 (Ser522Tyr) affected all the above mentioned physiological parameters in addition to the elicitation of Ces phenotype. These two rif mutations confer fast movement to RNAP and they bear Tyr as the substituted amino acid in the RBP. This is perhaps the first study that brings out the possible role of Tyr in the RBP and its participation in the global gene expression. This study also envisages the point that amino acid residues that share the properties of Tyr in the RBP can be employed as a tool to bring out differential gene expression which would certainly have basic and applied values for the mankind.

AB This study aimed to investigate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with lobaplatin-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with advanced lung cancer in China. Thirty-nine patients who received lobaplatin-based chemotherapy in the 307 Hospitals of Chinese People's Liberation Army from April 2017 to March 2018 were enrolled as study subjects. Peripheral blood DNA was extracted, and 79 candidate SNP positions were selected. A Sanger sequencing platform was employed to measure genotypes for locating the SNP positions associated with lobaplatin-induced thrombocytopenia. Of the 79 candidate genes, SNPs rs342275 and rs7694379 were significantly associated with lobaplatin-induced decrease in platelet (PLT) count (P < 0.05). SNPs rs342275, rs342293, rs11789898, and rs17824620 showed significant association with lobaplatin-induced lowest PLT counts (P < 0.05). SNPs rs342275, rs342293, rs11789898, rs17824620, and rs7694379 can be used as predictors of thrombocytopenia induced by lobaplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer in China.

AB An orthologous gene of SEPALLATA1, designated as IiSEP1, was isolated from Isatis indigotica. The genomic DNA of IiSEP1 is 3.1 Kb in length. The full-length cDNA of IiSEP1 is 1481 bp and contains a 756 bp ORF encoding a 251-amino-acid protein. Sequence comparison revealed that IiSEP1 belonged to the MADS-box gene family. IiSEP1 contains 7 exons and 6 introns, showing similar exon-intron structure with Arabidopsis SEP1. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that IiSEP1 belonged to AGL2/SEP subfamily and was likely to be an I. indigotica ortholog of Arabidopsis SEP1. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that IiSEP1 was predominantly expressed in the reproductive organs. Ectopic expression of IiSEP1 in Arabidopsis resulted in early flowering, accompanied with the reduction of inflorescence number and the production of terminal flower on the top of the main stems. Moreover, IiSEP1 overexpressing flowers generated numerous variations in phenotype. The sepals were changed into petal-sepal mosaic structures or displayed carpelloid features, and transparent ovules were formed in internal surface of these sepals. In addition, some flowers were constituted by sepals and pistil, but lacked petals and stamens. Taken together, IiSEP1 might play important roles in reproductive growth of I. indigotica and could affect the morphogenesis of flowers and fruits.

ID CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; PEPTIDYLARGININE DEIMINASE; FAMILY;

AB Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The hair shaft has a two-layer structure comprising the cortex, which is the inner layer and is composed of cortical cells, and the cuticle, which is the outermost layer. S100 calcium-binding protein A3 (S100A3) is expressed at high levels in the human hair cuticle. Arginine 51 of S100A3 protein is citrullinated specifically by peptidylarginine deiminase 3 (PAD3), and this citrullination is related to maturation of the cuticle. However, the detailed evolutionary processes of S100A3 and PAD3 during mammalian evolution are unknown. Here, we show that nonsynonymous changes in S100A3 accelerated in the common ancestral branch of mammals, probably as a result of positive selection that returned after the acquisition of hair cuticle-specific function in mammals. Later, pseudogenisation or nonfunctionalisation of S100A3 and PAD3 occurred in some species, such as the cetaceans. Our results show that positive selection and relaxation of the functional constraints of genes played important roles in the evolution of mammalian hair.

AB Phylogenetic tree using mitochondrial genes and nuclear genes have long been used for augmenting biological classification and understanding evolutionary processes in different lineage of life. But a basic question still exists for finding the most suitable gene for constructing robust phylogenetic tree. Much of the controversy appears due to monophyletic, paraphyletic and polyphyletic Glade making deviations from original taxonomy. In the present study we report the first complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of queen loach, generated through next-generation sequencing methods. The assembled mitogenome is a 16,492 bp circular DNA, comprising of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and a control region. Further in this study we also investigated the suitability of different mitochondrial region for phylogenetic analysis in Cyprinidae and loach group. For this genetic tree were constructed on COI, COII, COIII, 16S rRNA, 12S rRNA, Cyt b, ATPase 6, D-loop, ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND5, and ND6 along with complete mitogenome. The complete mitogenome based phylogenetic tree got inclusive support from available classical taxonomy for these groups. On individual gene basis Cyt b, 12S rRNA, ND2 and ND3 also produced perfect Glade at family and subfamily level. For rest of the genes polyphyly were observed for the fishes belonging to same family or subfamily which makes their use questionable for phylogenetic tree construction.

AB An in silica genome analysis of the probiotic Bacillus strain FTC01 was performed. The draft genome comprises 3.9 Mb, with a G + C content of 46.6% and a total of 3941 coding sequences. The species of strain FTC01 was defined as B. velezensis during GenBank genome annotation, following the current nomenclature. Eight gene clusters involved in the synthesis of non-ribosomal lipopeptides, polyketides and bacilysin were found, as well as part of the gene cluster involved in the synthesis of cyclic lipopeptide locillomycin. The production of lipopeptides surfactin and iturin by strain FTC01 was confirmed. In addition, a gene encoding a peptidylprolyl isomerase, involved in bacterial adhesion to the host tissue, beyond twelve genes responsible for acid tolerance and several hydrolase genes were found. These characteristics may help in host colonization and maintenance and may account for the probiotic properties observed for strain FTC01.

AB Eye development in vertebrates is a highly coordinated multistep process while defects in key factors might lead to severe congenital ocular disorders. SMO encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that functions in Hedgehog signal transduction, an essential step during eye development. Here we reported the first identification of compound heterozygous mutations (c.G338A; p.R113Q and c.C1619T; p.A540V) in the SMO gene in a patient with both anterior segment dysgenesis (congenital corneal opacity, cataract) and morning glory syndrome, using trio-based whole exome sequencing. The clinical manifestations of this patient were quite consistent with the phenotypes observed in murine SMO null mutants. In silico bioinformatics analyses showed that the newly identified mutations revealed extremely low allele frequencies in the general populations, and were predicted to affect SMO protein stability and residues physiochemical properties. Further investigations revealed a significant decrease of SMO expression in the patient compared with healthy controls (0.71 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.29, P = 0.0265). Therefore, this study pinpoints, for the first time, the potential key sites in SMO that contribute to the maintenance of healthy ocular development, highlighting potential targets for upcoming gene therapy.

AB Phenolic aldehydes from lignocellulose pretreatment harshly inhibit the viability and metabolism of ethanol fermenting strains. Direct conversion of phenolic aldehydes is usually incomplete due to their low water solubility and recalcitrance to bioconversion. Here we consolidated phenolic aldehydes bioconversion and ethanol fermentation in a typical ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis by constructing an intracellular oxidative pathway. The gene PP_2680 encoding NAD(+)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was expressed in Z. mobilis ZM4. The expression significantly improved both aldehyde inhibitor conversion and ethanol fermentability in corn stover hydrolysate. The purified PP_2680 aldehyde dehydrogenase showed strong in vitro oxidative capacity on phenolic aldehydes and its in vivo expression significantly up-regulated the key genes in the ED pathway and the oxidative phosphorylation. This study provided an important concept of simultaneous biodetoxification and fermentation in ethanologenic strains for the improvement of ethanol fermentability.

AB The aim of this work was to investigate the use of zinc oxide nanoparticles (nZnO) as nanocarriers for plant auxins indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and determine the effects on rhizogenesis in micro cuttings of different Pyrus species. Auxin loaded nanoparticles (IAA-nZnO and IBA-nZnO) were characterized for particle size, morphology, thermal behavior and chemical structure. A high loading capacity was observed for both auxins ((similar to)90%). Bioactivity assays were performed by using micro cuttings of Pyrus genotypes (Pyrus elaeagrifolia Pall and Pyrus communis L.) under aseptic conditions by dilute solution soaking method. In vitro rooting efficiency was increased at least two folds for the difficult-to-root wild pear (Pyrus elaeagrifolia Pallas) with IAA or IBA loaded ZnO nanoparticles. In this genotype, the highest rooting percentage was achieved for IBA-nZnO and IAA-nZnO at 400 mgL(-1) concentration as 50.0% and 41.7%, respectively. Thus, auxin loaded ZnO nanoparticles could be used as efficient nanocarriers in agricultural applications.

AB Exenatide (Ex) is a 39-amino acid peptide of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that was approved by the FDA in 2005 as a Type II diabetes treatment. It shows a 53% homology with GLP-1 but has an extended half-life (ca. 2.4 h) relative to GLP-1 (ca. 2-3 min). In this study, to further extend its in vivo half-life, we constructed a fusion protein (Ex-(EBP)(10)-6xHis) using a biocompatible and inert elastin-based polypeptide (EBP) as a fusion partner. Valine was inserted into the guest position of the pentapeptide (VPGXG), no linker sequence was inserted in between the EBPs, and (EBP)(10)-6xHis tag was attached to the C-terminus of exenatide. By using a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system, the fusion protein was expressed and secreted to the broth and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Compared with the native exenatide, the physical half-life of the fusion protein was ca. 3.7-fold extended while approximately 72% of the in-vitro insulin secreting activity was maintained. However, the biological half-life measured by a glucose tolerance test (GTT) and the hypoglycemic test in mice was not significantly different from that of the native form. The effects of EBPylation on bioactivity and half-life of the fusion protein are similar to those of PEGylation. The result suggests that the bioactivity and half-life should be carefully balanced to obtain optimal fusion proteins. We expect that EBPylation using an optimal repeat number of EBP can be an alternative to chemical modification for therapeutic biobetters with extended half-life.

AB Internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene is one of the most frequent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and it is associated with worse clinical outcome. Not only the presence but also the size, localization and the rate of this variant or the presence of multiple ITDs has prognostic information. The traditional PCR based diagnostic methods cannot provide information about all of these parameters in one assay, however the application of next generation sequencing (NGS) technique can be a reliable solution for this diagnostic problem. In order to evaluate the analytical properties of an NGS-based FLT3-ITD detection assay a quality control sample was prepared from DNA of AML patients containing 19 different FLT3-ITD variants identified by NGS. The higher the total read count was in a certain sample of the NGS run, the more ITD variant types could be detected. The maximal sensitivity of FLT3-ITD detection by NGS technique was as low as 0.007% FLT3-ITD/total allele rate, however, below 0.1% rate, the reproducibility of the quantitation was poor (CV > 25%). DNA pools with several FLT3-ITDs can be used efficiently for analytical evaluation of NGS-based FLT3-ITD quantitation testing several different ITD sequences and rates, simultaneously.

AB Komagataella pastoris was recently proposed as a source of valuable polysaccharides, namely, the co-polymer chitin-glucan complex (CGC) and mannose-containing polymers (mannans), that are extracted from its cell-wall. In this study, a novel cultivation medium, Medium K, was developed envisaging the simultaneous production of both types of cell-wall polysaccharides. The use of Medium K for the cultivation of K. pastoris resulted in high contents of CGC (19 wt%) and mannans (21 wt%) in the biomass, corresponding to significantly higher products' volumetric productivities (17.5 and 19.2 g/L day, respectively) compared to previous studies. The produced CGC had a chitin: beta-glucan molar ratio of 12:88, similarly to previously reported values for K. pastoris CGC (11:89-19:81), while the mannans were mainly composed of mannose units, with a protein content of 10 wt%. These results demonstrated that the developed optimized medium was suitable for cultivation of K. pastoris and the production of both CGC and mannans. It comprised fewer components with considerably reduced salts content, thus representing a significant simplification of the bioprocess with no precipitation problems, without impacting on the polymers' composition.

AB Consecutive dark-fermentation and photo-fermentation stages were investigated for a profitable circular bioeconomy. H-2 photo-production versus poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) accumulation is a modern biotechnological approach to use agro-food industrial byproducts as no-cost rich-nutrient medium in eco-sustainable biological processes. Whey and molasses are very important byproducts rich in nutrients that lactic acid bacteria can convert, by dark-fermentation, in dark fermented effluents of whey (DFEW) and molasses (DFEM). These effluents are proper media for culturing purple non-sulfur bacteria, which are profitable producers of P3HB and H-2. The results of the present study show that Lactobacillus sp. and Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-VOGS3 are two representative genera for mitigation of environmental impact. The highest productivity of P3HB (4.445 mg/(L.h)) was achieved culturing Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-VOGS3, when feeding the bacterium with 20% of DFEM; the highest H-2 production rate of 4.46 mL/(L.h) was achieved when feeding the bacterium with 30% of DFEM.

AB Different strategies have been developed and successfully applied to biotherapeutics in order to improve their in vivo efficacy. The genetic fusion to natural or synthetic glycosylated peptides constitutes a promising strategy since it conserves the protein sequence and results in the improvement of the pharmacokinetic properties. The ANITVNITV peptide described by Perlmann and coworkers presents 9 amino acids and 2 potential N-glycosylation sites. Its fusion to FSH resulted in the increase of the molecular mass and negative charge of the protein. Consequently, the pharmacokinetics was considerably improved. The aim of the present study was to compare the influence of ANITVNITV peptide fusion on the physicochemical, biological and pharmacokinetic properties of native hIFN-alpha 2b (IFNwt), which contains a single O-glycosylation site, and a hyperglycosylated variant (IFN4N), that bears, in addition, 4 N-linked glycans. The resulting molecules, IFNwtNter and IFN4NNter, evidenced a higher molecular mass and negative charge compared to IFNwt and IFN4N, respectively. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic properties of the new molecules were significantly improved. The molecules obtained by the synthetic peptide fusion strategy evidenced a decrease in their in vitro antiviral specific biological activities (SBA). However, in vitro antiproliferative SBA was differentially modified for IFNwtNter and IFN4NNter in comparison with the parental molecules. For IFNwtNter, a reduction in the antiproliferative SBA was also observed. Remarkably, the addition of the ANITVNITV peptide to the N-terminus of IFN4N had a positive impact on its growth-inhibitory activity. This feature together with its improved pharmacokinetics encourages the development of IFN4NNter as an IFN-alpha based biobetter.

AB Carboxylic acids (CAs) are widespread in Nature. A prominent example is fatty acids, a major constituent of lipids. CAs are potentially economical precursors for bio-based products such as bio-aldehydes and bio-alcohols. However, carboxylate reduction is a challenging chemical transformation due to the thermodynamic stability of carboxylate. Carboxylic acid reductases (CARs), found in bacteria and fungi, offer a good solution to this challenge. These enzymes catalyse the NADPH- and ATP-dependent reduction of aliphatic and aromatic CAs. This review summarised all the protein engineering work that has been done on these versatile biocatalysts to date. The intricate catalytic mechanism and structure of CARs prompted us to first examine their domain architecture to facilitate the subsequent discussion of various protein engineering strategies. This then led to a survey of assays to detect aldehyde formation and to monitor aldenylation activity. Strategies for NADPH and ATP regeneration were also incorporated, as they are deemed vital to developing preparative-scale biocatalytic process and high-throughput screening systems. The objectives of the review are to consolidate CAR engineering research, stimulate interest, discussion or debate, and advance the field of bioreduction.

AB Nowadays, research concerning immunomodulatory products are of great interest, particularly in the treatment of inflammatory diseases or the prevention of infectious diseases. These activities are usually evaluated on cell cultures, by tracking different factors requiring dedicated manipulation. Evaluation of the immunomodulatory activities of essential oils and pure compounds using several technics adapted to high content analysis is described in this study. This approach allows a multiparametric evaluation on a single cell batch, in order to obtain an overall response. The developed method is based on the simultaneous evaluation of phagocytosis, production of iNOS and secretion of IL-6, induced by contact of RAW 264.7 cells with LPS. The results highlight the immunomodulatory activities of cinnamon and clove essential oils. They also provide information, particularly concerning the inhibitory activity of mint essential oil, which inhibits the LPS-induced phagocytosis of RAW 264.7 cells by 42%, at 100 mu g/ml. This work presents for the first time the adaptation of high content analyses for the monitoring of immunomodulatory activities of essential oils. This protocol could be adjustable to other cell types and supplemented by the evaluation of additional parameters.

AB Carboxylic acid reductases (CARs) catalyze ATP- and NADPH-dependent reduction of carboxylic acids to corresponding aldehydes. Although successful applications of these enzymes for the bioconversion of monocarboxylic acids have already been reported, their applicability for the reduction of dicarboxylic acids is not well understood. Here, we explored the possibility of engineering CARs for enhanced activity toward succinic acid for potential applications in 1,4-butanediol production. Structural models of the carboxylate-binding pocket of the CAR enzyme MAB4714 from Mycobacterium abscessus suggested that its reactivity toward succinic acid could be enhanced by reducing the pocket volume. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we introduced larger side chains into the MAB4714 carboxylate binding pocket and compared the activity of 16 mutant proteins against cinnamic and succinic acids. These experiments revealed that, although the reaction rates remain low, the replacement of Leu284 or Thr285 with Trp increased activity toward succinic acid more than two times. The T285E mutant protein also showed increased activity toward succinic acid, but it was lower than that of T285W. The mutated residues of MAB4714 are located on the flexible loop covering the carboxylate-binding pocket, which appears to contribute to substrate preference of CARs. Thus, reductase activity of CARs against succinic acid can be improved by introducing large side chains into the carboxylate-binding pocket. We also discovered that alanine replacement of the conserved Ser713 in the CAR phosphopantetheine attachment site resulted in complete degradation of the full-length protein into separate A and R domains, suggesting that CAR phosphopantetheinylation is important for its stability in solution.

AB Background: Acute paracetamol (PCM) toxicity is a clinical problem; can result in a serious liver injury that finally may progress to acute liver failure. Curcumin (CUR) is a prevalent natural compound that can maintain prooxidant/antioxidant balance and thus can help in liver protection; also, Silymarin (SL) is a traditional antioxidant herb, used to treat liver disorders through scavenging free radicals. This study aimed to illustrate the histological, biochemical and molecular changes induced by acute PCM overdose on rats' liver to elucidate the effectiveness of CUR compared to SL in alleviating such changes.
   Materials and methods: Male Wister Albino rats were divided into 6 groups each comprising 23 rats: control group, curcumin (CUR) treated group received (100 mg CUR/ kg), silymarin treated group received (100 mg SL/kg) for 7 successive days. Paracetamol (PCM) exposed group administered a single dose of PCM (200 mg/kg orally on 8th day). PCM + CUR group and PCM + SL group pretreated with CUR and SL respectively for 7 days then received single PCM dose (200 mg/kg) on the 8th day. Blood and liver tissues were collected for biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses using anti-p53 antibody. In addition, real time polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) was used to measure Bax, bcl2 and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) mRNA expression levels.
   Results: In the paracetamol overdose group, the liver architecture showed necrotic changes, hydropic degeneration, congestion and dilatation of central veins. This hepatocellular damage was confirmed by a significant increase of AST, ALT levels and by an apparent increase in the number of p53 stained cells. PCM toxicity showed significant elevation of total oxidant status (TOS), oxidant status index (OSI) and decreased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared to controls (p < 0.001). Gene expression analysis showed that PCM caused an elevation of bcl2 and a reduction of both Bax and PPAR gamma mRNA expression. The histological alternation in the liver architecture was markedly improved in (PCM + CUR) group compared to (PCM + SL) group, with an obvious decrease in the number of P53 stained cells. CUR pretreatment inhibited the elevation of TOS and OSI as well as the reduction of TAC caused by PCM toxicity compared to (PCM + SL) group.
   Conclusion: Both SL and CUR pretreatment prevented the toxic effects of PCM, but CUR is more effective than SL in ameliorating acute PCM induced hepatotoxicity.

AB As seen in other types of cancer, development of drug resistance in NSCLC treatment causes adverse effects on disease fighting process. Recent studies have shown that one of the drug resistance development mechanisms is that cancer cells may acquire the ability to escape from cell death. Therefore, development of anticancer drugs which have the strategy to redirect cancer cells to any cell death pathways may provide positive results for cancer treatments. Autophagy may be a target mechanism of alternative cancer treatment strategy in cases of blocked apoptosis. There is also a complex molecular link between autophagy and apoptosis, has not been fully understood yet. The dicyano compound which we used in our study caused cell death in NSCLC cell lines. When we analyzed the cells which were treated with dicyano compound by transmission electron microscope, we observed autophagosome structures. Upon this result, we investigated expression levels of autophagic proteins in the dicyano compound-treated cells by immunoblotting and observed that expression levels of autophagic proteins were increased significantly. The TUNEL assay and qRT-PCR for pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic gene expression, which we performed to assess apoptosis in the dicyano compound-treated cells, showed that the cell death does not occur through apoptotic pathway. We showed that the dicyano compound, which was developed in our laboratories, may play a role in molecular link between apoptosis and autophagy and may shed light on development of new anticancer treatment strategies.

AB Since international federation of gynecology and obstetrics (FIGO) staging is mainly based on clinical assessment, an integrated approach for mining RNA based biomarkers for understanding the molecular deregulation of signaling pathways and RNAs in cervical cancer was proposed in this study. Publicly available data were mined for identifying significant RNAs after patient staging. Significant miRNA families were identified from mRNA-miRNA and lncRNA-miRNA interaction network analyses followed by stage specific mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA association network generation. Integrated bioinformatic analyses of selected mRNAs and lncRNAs were performed. Results suggest that HBA1, HBA2, HBB, SLC2A1, CXCL10 (stage I), PKIA (stage III) and S100A7 (stage IV) were important. miRNA family enrichment of interacting miRNA partners of selected RNAs indicated the enrichment of let-7 family. Assembly of collagen fibrils and other multimeric structures_Homosapiens_R-HSA-2022090 in pathway analysis and progesterone_CTD_00006624 in DSigDB analysis were the most significant and SLC2A1, hsa-miR-188-3p, hsa-miR-378a-3p and hsa-miR-150-5p were selected as survival markers.

AB The Wnt signaling pathway has been identified for its function in carcinogenesis and embryonic development. It is known to play a vital role in the initiation and development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, it is of great importance for CRC research to illuminate the mechanisms which regulate Wnt pathway activity. Here, we intended to examine the effect of hsa-miR-942 (miR-942) on the Wnt signaling activity, cell cycle progression, and its expression in CRC tissues. RT-qPCR results indicated that miR-942 is significantly upregulated in colorectal cancer. Then, overexpression of miR-942 promoted, whereas its inhibition decreased the Wnt signaling activity, detected by RT-qPCR and Top/Fop flash assay. Inhibition of Wnt signaling by using PNU-74654 or IWP-2 small molecules indicated that miR-942 applies its effect to the beta-catenin degradation complex level. Then, RT-qPCR and dual luciferase assay showed that miR-942 upregulated Wnt signaling through direct targeting of APC, which is a tumor suppressor in Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, the western blotting analysis indicated that beta.catenin, as a main member of Wnt signaling pathway is upregulated following the overexpression of miR-942. Finally, miR-942 overexpression resulted in cell cycle progression in SW480 cells. Taken together, our findings established an oncogenic role for miR-942 in CRC and indicated that this miRNA might be a crucial target for CRC therapy.

AB Reactive oxygen species, generated in all the aerobic organisms, can cause oxidative stress. Excessive ROS may become a source of carcinogen due to DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, cell injury, and cell death. In order to prevent these adverse effects of ROS, antioxidant enzymes have evolved in aerobic organisms. Catalase is a major antioxidant enzyme that breaks down excessive H2O2 and inhibits apoptotic cell death. Here we molecularly characterized catalase from red-lip mullet. The cDNA sequence of LhCAT consists of an ORF of 1545 bp, which encodes a 527 amino acid peptide (similar to 60 kDa). Based on bioinformatics analysis, LhCAT possesses a domain architecture characteristic of catalases, including a catalase proximal active site signature and a catalase proximal heme-ligand signature. It also has heme and NADPH binding sites homologous to previously described catalases. Pairwise alignment with its homologs revealed that LhCAT shares 95.1% identity with Oplegnathus fasciatus catalase and 97.4% similarity with Sparus aurata catalase. An uprooted phylogenetic tree demonstrated that LhCAT resides in a Glade with catalases from other teleosts and exhibits a close relationship with Oplegnathus fasciatus catalase. Among twelve tissue types, we observed the highest LhCAT mRNA expression in the liver, followed by blood. Immune challenge by Lactococcus garvieae, or Poly I:C in the blood or spleen resulted in up regulation at 24 h post injection. We also tested the antioxidant activity of recombinant LhCAT against hydrogen peroxide and found its optimal concentration to be 12.5 mu g/mL. Collectively, these data suggested that LhCAT play an important role in antioxidant defense and immune response of red-lip mullet.

AB Gastric cancer represents a common malignancy of digestive tract with high incidence and mortality. Increasing evidence suggests that the growth of gastric tumor cells relies largely on aerobic glycolysis. Currently, many potential anti-cancer candidates are derived from natural products. Here, we evaluated the effects of oleanolic acid (OA), a triterpenoid component widely found in the plants of Oleaceae family, on aerobic glycolysis and proliferation in human MKN-45 and SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that OA reduced the viability and proliferation of gastric cancer cells and inhibited the expression of cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. OA blocked glycolysis in these cells evidenced by decreases in the uptake and consumption of glucose, intracellular lactate levels and extracellular acidification rate. Glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose, similar to OA, suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation. OA also decreased the expression and intracellular activities of glycolysis rate-limiting enzymes hexokinase 2 (HK2) and phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1). Moreover, OA downregulated the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and decreased its nuclear abundance. Upregulation of HIF-1 alpha by deferoxamine rescued OA-inhibited HK2 and PFK1. Furthermore, OA reduced the nuclear abundance of yes-associated protein (YAP) in gastric tumor cells. YAP inhibitor verteporfin, similar to OA, downregulated the expression of HIF-1 alpha and glycolytic enzymes in gastric cancer cells; whereas over expression of YAP abrogated all these effects of OA. Collectively, inhibition of YAP was responsible for OA blockade of HIF-1 alpha-mediated aerobic glycolysis and proliferation in human gastric tumor cells. OA could be developed as a promising candidate for gastric cancer treatment.

AB Blockade of Hedgehog signaling can prevent osteoarthritis (OA) syndromes. However, the amelioration of related inflammation condition is limited. The purpose of this study was to observe the effect of combined use of Hedgehog signaling inhibitor GANT-61 and common clinical anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin on cartilage injury and inflammation in experimental OA mice. We found that GANT-61 and indomethacin synergistically attenuate cartilage damage and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-2 and IL-6 in OA mice. Moreover, in vitro treatment of GANT-61 and indomethacin synergistically reduced the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-2 and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated C28/I2 chondrocytes. Mechasnistic studies showed that GANT-61 and indomethacin synergistically attenuate the expressions of cell pyroptosis-related genes caspase-1, IL-1 beta and IL-18 at mRNA and protein level. To conclude, our study showed that GANT-61 and indomethacin had a synergistically ameliorating effect on osteoarthritis by mediating chondrocytes pyroptosis.

ID EXPRESSION; PROTEINS; MARKERS; MIR-23B; CELLS
AB MicroRNA-23b (miR-23b) is associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases. This study evaluated miR-23b expression and assessed its potential as a biomarker of disease activity for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Differential expression of microRNAs was determined by miRNA microarray analysis in fibroblast-like syno-viocytes (FLSs) from four trauma patients as healthy controls (HCs) and eight RA patients. The microarray results showed elevated expression of miR-23b in FLSs from RA patients and this finding was corroborated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and in situ hybridization using synovial tissues (STs). Furthermore, we found miR-23b levels in plasma of RA patients were significantly higher than in HCs, and plasma miR-23b levels positively correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), C-reactive protein (CRP), DAS28, and platelet (PLT) count (P < 0.05). MiR-23b levels in plasma inversely correlated with the levels of hemoglobin (Hb), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P < 0.05), but not with rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) (P > 0.05). Moreover, patients with anorexia showed higher levels of miR-23b in plasma than those without anorexia. Similar results were observed with fatigue. Appropriate treatment for RA not only ameliorated the disease condition but also reversed the elevated plasma miR-23b level remarkably. These results suggest that circulating miR-23b may be a promising biomarker for RA disease activity.

AB Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the highest cause of mortality among female cancer patients. In some cases, BC is due to Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) gene dysregulation, which has been involved in various important cellular processes. Among Iranian women, the association between PARP1 polymorphisms and BC was never studied before so in this case-control study, the genetic association of three SNPs (rs1136410, rs907187 and rs4653734) was analyzed with susceptibility to BC.
   Methods: The study subjects were 386 Iranian females divided into 186 patients and 200 healthy controls. The genotypes of PARP1 variants were detected using ARMS and a combined ARMS-RFLP PCR method.
   Results: The results showed that Carriers of CG and GG genotypes of the variant rs4653734 were at higher risk of BC compared with wild-type carriers (CC) and this variant was statistically significant under a recessive model of inheritance. Moreover, rs907187 was related to increased BC risk in the CC and GG genotypes under dominant and recessive models of inheritance. The G allele frequency of rs4653734 and rs907187 was higher in breast cancer patients than in normal subjects. No association was detected between rs1136410 and susceptibility to BC among studied groups. Furthermore, A-G-C haplotype was linked to an increased BC risk, whereas A-C-C and A-C-G haplotypes were related to a decreased risk of BC. In Silico predictions suggested that rs907187 affects E2F and E2F-4 transcription factors binding site.
   Conclusions: The current study suggests that rs907187 and rs4653734 have remarkable associations with BC risk among Iranian women.

AB Veratrum nigrum is protected plant of Melanthiaceae family, able to synthetize unique steroidal alkaloids important for pharmacy. Transcriptomes from leaves, stems and rhizomes of in vitro maintained V. nigrum plants were sequenced and annotated for genes and markers discovery. Sequencing of samples derived from the different organs resulted in a total of 108,511 contigs with a mean length of 596 bp. Transcripts derived from leaf and stalk were annotated at 28%, and 38% in Nr nucleotide database, respectively. The sequencing revealed 949 unigenes related with lipid metabolism, including 73 transcripts involved in steroids and genus-specific steroid alkaloids biosynthesis. Additionally, 3203 candidate SSRs markers we identified in unigenes with average density of one SSR locus every 6.2 kb sequence. Unraveling of biochemical machinery of the pathway responsible for steroidal alkaloids will open possibility to design and optimize biotechnological process. The transcriptomic data provide valuable resources for biochemical, molecular genetics, comparative transcriptomics, functional genomics, ecological and evolutionary studies of V. nigrum.

AB Two core polyadenylation elements (CPE) located in the 3' untranslated region of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs play an essential role in their processing: the polyadenylation signal (PAS) AAUAAA and the cleavage site (CS), preferentially a CA dinucleotide. Herein, we characterized PAS and CS sequences in a set of cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) and performed an in silico investigation of microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation to identify potential tumor-suppressive and oncogenic miRNAs. NCBI and alternative polyadenylation databases were queried to characterize CPE sequences in 117 CPGs, including 81 and 17 known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, respectively. miRNA-mediated regulation analysis was performed using predicted and validated data sources. Based on NCBI analyses, we did not find an established PAS in 21 CPGs, and verified that the majority of PAS already described (74.4%) had the canonical sequence AAUAAA. Interestingly, "AA" dinucleotide was the most common CS (37.5%) associated with this set of genes. Approximately 90% of CPGs exhibited evidence of alternative polyadenylation (more than one functional PAS). Finally, the mir-192 family was significantly over-represented as regulator of tumor suppressor genes (P < 0.01), which suggests a potential oncogenic function. Overall, this study provides a landscape of CPE in CPGs, which might be useful in development of future molecular analyses covering these frequently neglected regulatory sequences.

AB Recently, we read the published article in GENE. Dong et al. presented the evaluation of the MDM2 40-bp insertion/deletion status in Hepatocellular carcinoma patients (Dong et al., 2012).
   The authors stated that the insertion allele showed a 521-bp band and the deletion allele showed a 481-bp band on agarose gel electrophoresis. While it seems that these reported sizes for insertion and deletion alleles of MDM2 are incorrect. Our analysis using the primers indicated that the length of insertion and deletion fragments will be 481 and 441 bps, respectively. Actually, 40-bp is added to the fragment length instead of reducing the 40 bp.
   In the 'UCSC In-Silico PCR' tool, the length of the amplified fragment using mentioned primers is 481-bp including the sequence of 40-bp insertion allele (5'-(A)(5)GCTGCA(GAAGG)(2)ATATAACTTTAT(A)(7)-3') (Reference SNP (rs) Report, n.d.). Therefore, the fragment including the deletion allele will be 441-bp.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to identify the expression of LIM and calponin-homology domains 1 (LIMCH1) in lung cancer and normal tissues, to determine the interaction between LIMCH1 and HUWE1 in regulating p53 stability.
   Methods: The expression of LIMCH1 was detected by the Oncomine and Cancer Genome Atlas databases. Expression of LIMCH1 mRNA was identified using qRT-PCR. In transfected human lung cancer cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. The mechanism that HUWE1 sustained lung cancer malignancy was verified by western blotting. The proliferation of tranfected cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay and colony formation.
   Results: Bioinformatic data and e TCGA database suggested LIMCH1 mRNA levels in tumor tissues were down regulated compared to tumor adjacent tissues. We found low expression of LIMCH1 mRNA in tumor sites and tumor cell line. Exogenous expression of LIMCH1 interacts with HUWE1 promotes expression of p53. Use of siRNA or shRNA against LIMCH1 resulted in decreased p53 protein levels. LIMCH1 deletion lead to enhance of p53 ubiquitination and protein expression of p53 and substrate p21, puma. Growth curve showed that LIMCH1 deletion significantly promoted the proliferation of A549 cells.
   Conclusions: LIMCH1 was a negative regulator and indicated a new molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of lung cancer via modulating HUWE1 and p53.

AB It is known that IncRNA PLAC2 can inhibit glioma. This study explored the function of PLAC2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our data showed that PLAC2 expression in HCC was not affect by HCV and HBV infection, while PLAC2 levels were significantly lower in HCC tissues comparing to non-cancer tissues. Low PLAC2 levels in HCC tissues were associated with low overall 5-year survival rate. P53 mRNA was also downregulated in HCC and positively correlated with PLAC2. PLAC2 overexpression caused upregulated p53 and increase cancer cell apoptosis. P53 overexpression failed to affect PLAC2. In addition, p53 silencing reduced the effects of PLAC2 overexpression. Therefore, PLAC2 upregulated p53 to mediate cancer cell apoptosis.

TI Household costs of seeking BCG vaccination in rural Guinea-Bissau
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE BCG vaccination; Household cost; Vaccination cost
AB In Guinea-Bissau, a vial of BCG vaccine is often not opened unless 10 infants are present for vaccination, with the aim of reducing vaccine wastage. This causes delays in vaccination, as previously demonstrated in Guinea-Bissau and other low-income countries. Reducing wastage of BCG vaccine to save money may deprive infants of important health benefits and transfer costs from the vaccination programme to mothers.
   Using the Bandim Health Project's rural Health and Demographic Surveillance System, we interviewed mothers of infants aged 1-11 months about household costs of seeking BCG vaccination.
   On average mothers took their infant for BCG vaccination 1.26 times before obtaining the vaccine. For mothers who had sought BCG vaccine for their infants the average cost was 1.89 USD for each BCG-vaccinated infant. Among BCG-unvaccinated infants at the time of interview, 42% had brought their infant for BCG vaccination in vain at an average cost of 2.83 USD. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Zoster vaccine live (ZVL [Zostavax]) has been recommended for the prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) among immunocompetent adults >= 60 years in the United States since 2008. To examine changes in healthcare providers' perceptions and practices related to HZ disease and vaccination, we administered surveys to national networks of primary care physicians in 2005, 2008, and 2016. Ten years after ZVL was first licensed, physicians were more likely to respond that they perceived HZ as a serious disease and more strongly recommended ZVL, and were less likely to report less likely to report several major barriers to HZ vaccination such as patient cost, vaccine effectiveness and competing medical concerns. Overall, physician attitudes appear to be more favorable towards zoster vaccination after a decade of availability of a HZ vaccine. The new recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV [Shingrix]) may benefit from physician's increased perception of the importance of HZ and HZ vaccination. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI HPV vaccine uptake in men who have sex with men in Scotland

DE MSM; HPV; Vaccine; Sexual health
ID CANCER
AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are currently utilised globally in national immunisation programmes. In July 2017, a national HPV vaccine programme for men who have sex with men (MSM) was initiated across Scotland with vaccine being offered in the sexual health clinic setting. During the first year of this targeted vaccination programme, there were 5905 individuals who received at least one dose of HPV vaccine, representing 63.7% of eligible MSM attendees in this period. Vaccine uptake was relatively stable across all age groups (range 49.8-55.5%). The vaccination programme appears to have dovetailed well with pre-existing sexual health services and appears to be popular with MSM attending the service. The MSM HPV vaccine programme is a robust adjunct to the national girls programme but gender-neutral immunisation will reduce stigma and inequality in HPV-driven disease.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines must be carefully selected and their application closely monitored to optimise their effectiveness. This review covers serological techniques for FMD vaccine quality control, including potency testing, vaccine matching and post-vaccination monitoring. It also discusses alternative laboratory procedures, such as antigen quantification and nucleotide sequencing, and briefly compares the approaches for FMD with those for measuring protection against influenza virus, where humoral immunity is also important. Serology is widely used to predict the protection afforded by vaccines and has great practical utility but also limitations. Animals differ in their responses to vaccines and in the protective mechanisms that they develop. Antibodies have a variety of properties and tests differ in what they measure. Antibody-virus interactions may vary between virus serotypes and strains and protection may be affected by the vaccination regime and the nature and timing of field virus challenge. Finally, tests employing biological reagents are difficult to standardise, whilst cross-protection data needed for test calibration and validation are scarce. All of this is difficult to reconcile with the desire for simple and universal criteria and thresholds for evaluating vaccines and vaccination responses and means that oversimplification of test procedures and their interpretation can lead to poor predictions. A holistic approach is therefore recommended, considering multiple sources of field, experimental and laboratory data. New antibody avidity and isotype tests seem promising alternatives to evaluate cross-protective, post-vaccination serological responses, taking account of vaccine potency as well as match. After choosing appropriate serological tests or test combinations and cut-offs, results should be interpreted cautiously and in context. Since opportunities for experimental challenge studies of cross-protection are limited and the approaches incompletely reflect real life, more field studies are needed to quantify cross-protection and its correlation to in vitro measurements.

AB Extending the benefits of vaccination to everyone who is eligible requires an understanding of which populations current vaccination efforts have struggled to reach. A clear definition of "hard-to-reach" populations - also known as high-risk or marginalized populations, or reaching the last mile - is essential for estimating the size of target groups, sharing lessons learned based on consistent definitions, and allocating resources appropriately. A literature review was conducted to determine what formal definitions of hard-to-reach populations exist and how they are being used, and to propose definitions to consider for future use. Overall, we found that (1) there is a need to distinguish populations that are hard to reach versus hard to vaccinate, and (2) the existing literature poorly defined these populations and clear criteria or thresholds for classifying them were missing. Based on this review, we propose that hard-to-reach populations be defined as those facing supply-side barriers to vaccination due to geography by distance or terrain, transient or nomadic movement, healthcare provider discrimination, lack of healthcare provider recommendations, inadequate vaccination systems, war and conflict, home births or other homebound mobility limitations, or legal restrictions. Although multiple mechanisms may apply to the same population, supply-side barriers should be distinguished from demand-side barriers. Hard-to-vaccinate populations are defined as those who are reachable but difficult to vaccinate due to distrust, religious beliefs, lack of awareness of vaccine benefits and recommendations, poverty or low socioeconomic status, lack of time to access available vaccination services, or gender-based discrimination. Further work is needed to better define hard-to-reach populations and delineate them from populations that may be hard to vaccinate due to complex refusal reasons, improve measurement of the size and importance of their impact, and examine interventions related to overcoming barriers for each mechanism. This will enable policy makers, governments, donors, and the vaccine community to better plan interventions and allocate necessary resources to remove existing barriers to vaccination.

AB Recent studies have suggested that among those receiving seasonal influenza vaccine (Sly), reduced immunogenicity is observed in recently vaccinated (RV; within the past season or 2) persons when compared with those not recently vaccinated (NRV). We performed a meta-analysis to assess the effect of recent immunization with SIV on serum H5 hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses after influenza A/H5N1 vaccination using data from a series of randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was seroconversion measured by HAI assays following receipt of 2 doses of H5N1 vaccine. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of serum HAI antibody after vaccination was the secondary outcome. Analyses were performed using propensity score (PS) matching. The PS for each individual in the meta-analysis cohort was calculated using logistic regression and covariates included age, gender, race, antigen dose, adjuvant, statin use and vaccine manufacturer. 2015 subjects enrolled in 7 clinical trials were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis cohort; among these, 915 (45%) were RV. 901 RV subjects were matched (1:1) with replacement to a subject who was NRV. Subjects who received SIV within the previous season were significantly less likely to seroconvert following H5N1 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio 0.76; 95%CI 0.60-0.96; p = 0.024), and the GMT was 18% higher among NRV subjects (GM ratio of HAI antibody 1.18; 95%CI 1.04-1.33; p = 0.008). Further work is needed to better define the effects of, and mechanisms contributing to, reduced immune responses to H5N1 vaccine among RV subjects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute, immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy. Infections and vaccines have been hypothesized to play a role in triggering GBS development. These beliefs can play a role in reducing vaccination coverage. In this report, data concerning this hypothesis are discussed. It is shown that an association between vaccine administration and GBS has never been proven for most of debated vaccines, although it cannot be definitively excluded. The only exception is the influenza vaccine, at least for the preparation used in 1976. For some vaccines, such as measles/mumps/rubella, human papillomavirus, tetravalent conjugated meningococcal vaccine, and influenza, the debate between supporters and opponents of vaccination remains robust and perception of vaccines' low safety remains a barrier to achieving adequate vaccination coverage. Less than 1 case of GBS per million immunized persons might occur for these vaccines. However, in some casesimmunization actually reduces the risk of GBS development. In addition, the benefits of vaccination are clearly demonstrated by the eradication or enormous decline in the incidence of many vaccine-preventable diseases. These data highlight that the hypothesized risks of adverse events, such as GBS, cannot be considered a valid reason to avoid the administration of currently recommended vaccines.

AB Moraxella catarrhalis is the second most common cause of exacerbations in adults with COPD, resulting in enormous morbidity and mortality in this clinical setting. Vaccine development for M. catarrhalis has lagged behind the other two important causes of exacerbations in COPD, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. While no licensed vaccine is currently available for M. catarrhalis, several promising candidate vaccine antigens have been identified and characterized and are close to entering clinical trials. Key steps that are required to advance vaccines for M. catarrhalis along the translational pipeline include standardization of assay systems to assess candidate antigens, identification of a reliable correlate of protection and expansion of partnerships between industry, academia and government to overcome regulatory hurdles. A vaccine to prevent M. catarrhalis infections in COPD would have a major impact in reducing morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs in COPD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) infection can cause severe debilitating complications and even death in young children. The immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated whole EV-A71 virus vaccine were assessed in children 2 months to 6 years of age.
   Methods: This was an open-label, multi-center and randomized phase IIb study, which divided into part A and B. In part A, children 36 months to 6 years of age were enrolled and randomized into 3 groups, receiving 0.5 mu g total viral protein (TP) with adjuvant Al(OH)3, 1.0 mu g TP with Al(OH)3 or 1.0 mu g TP only. Two doses of vaccines were administered at a 28-day interval and blood was taken before immunization, at week 4, 8, 28 and 52 (optional) for virus neutralization assay. Safety profiles were also monitored. After safety profiles had shown no concerns, children 2 months to 35 months of age (part B) were subsequently enrolled following the same protocol.
   Results: A total of 135 children completed two doses of immunization, including 58 in part A and 77 in part B. Both adjuvanted 0.5 mu g and 1.0 mu g TP elicited significant raise of neutralizing antibody titers and seroconversion rate was up to 93.75-100.0% after 2 doses of immunization. Adjuvanted 1.0 mu g TP induced higher titers of neutralizing antibodies than adjuvanted 0.5 mu g TP. By contrast, non-adjuvanted 1.0 mu g TP was not immunogenic. No major adverse events were reported.
   Conclusions: This EV-A71 vaccine containing adjuvant is immunogenic and safe in children 2 months to 6 years of age. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seasonal influenza virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality every year. Annual influenza virus vaccines are effective but only when well matched with circulating strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need for better vaccines that induce broad protection against drifted seasonal and emerging pandemic influenza viruses. One approach to design such vaccines is based on targeting conserved regions of the influenza virus hemagglutinin. Sequential vaccination with chimeric hemagglutinin constructs can refocus antibody responses towards the conserved immunosubdominant stalk domain of the hemagglutinin, rather than the variable immunodominant head. A complementary approach for a universal influenza A virus vaccine is to induce T-cell responses to conserved internal influenza virus antigens. For this purpose, replication deficient recombinant viral vectors based on Chimpanzee Adenovirus Oxford 1 and Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus are used to express the viral nucleoprotein and the matrix protein 1. In this study, we combined these two strategies and evaluated the efficacy of viral vectors expressing both chimeric hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein plus matrix protein 1 in a mouse model against challenge with group 2 influenza viruses including H3N2, H7N9 and H10N8. We found that vectored vaccines expressing both sets of antigens provided enhanced protection against H3N2 virus challenge when compared to vaccination with viral vectors expressing only one set of antigens. Vaccine induced antibody responses against divergent group 2 hemagglutinins, nucleoprotein and matrix protein 1 as well as robust T-cell responses to the nucleoprotein and matrix protein 1 were detected. Of note, it was observed that while antibodies to the H3 stalk were already boosted to high levels after two vaccinations with chimeric hemagglutinins (cHAs), three exposures were required to induce strong reactivity across subtypes. Overall, these results show that a combinations of different universal influenza virus vaccine strategies can induce broad antibody and T-cell responses and can provide increased protection against influenza.

Applying a genetic system that enables the rapid generation of transgenic yeast, we have developed K. lactis strains that express the influenza A virus hemagglutinin, HA, either individually or in combination with the viral M1 matrix protein. Subcutaneous application of the inactivated, but otherwise non-processed yeast material shows a complete protection of BALB/c mice in prime/boost and even one-shot/single dose vaccination schemes against a subsequent, lethal challenge with the cognate influenza virus. The yeast vaccines induce titers of neutralizing antibodies that are readily comparable to those induced by an inactivated virus vaccine. These data suggest that HA and M1 are produced with a high antigenicity in the yeast cells. Based on these findings, multivalent, DIVA-capable, yeast-based subunit vaccines may be developed as promising alternatives to conventional virus-based anti-flu vaccines for veterinary applications.

AB For decades, an on-going concerted effort has been made to develop a universal DNA vaccine to combat the looming threat of a potential outbreak of the emerging Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. However, effective strategies are urgently required to counter poor immunogenicity and insufficient long-term protection. Recent reports have confirmed the critical role of autophagy in antigen presentation, long-term immune memory and immune responses against JEV. In this study, JEV prM and E protein with strong immunogenicity were fused with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) encoding gene to construct an autophagy-mediated pJME-LC3 DNA vaccine. Researches indicated significant increase of autophagosomes or LC3 II expression in pJME-LC3 transfected cells. Furthermore, prME-LC3 fused protein was observed co-localized with GFP-LC3 to autophagosomes, which means it was successfully targeted to autophagosomes. After immunizing with pJME-LC3, mice were detected highest proportion of CD3(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD8(+) effector memory T cells (TEMs) and JEV specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity to eliminate JEV. pJME-LC3 also enhanced IgG2a antibody in serum and cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-12 produced by splenocytes, thus skew toward Th1 type immune response by activating the JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway and upregulating expression of transcription factor T-bet. Notably, mice immunized with pJME-LC3 showed highest survival rate and long-lasting neutralizing antibody when challenged with virulent JEV, which were consistent with augment in percentage of CD4(+) central memory T cells (TCMs). In brief, our studies suggested that autophagy can be used as a optimization strategy to enhance JEV specific immune response and long-term immune memory. Our attempt will contribute towards future efforts to develop an efficacious JEV vaccine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lyme disease (LD) accounts for over 70% of tick-borne disease reported in the United States. The disease in humans is characterized by skin rash, arthritis, cardiac and neurological signs. Vaccination is the most efficient preventive measure that could be taken to reduce the incidence of the LD worldwide; however, at present no vaccine is available. In this study, evaluation of the Borrelia burgdorferi BB0172-derived peptide (PepB) in conjugated formulations was investigated as a vaccine candidate in murine model of LD. In brief, PepB was conjugated to the Cross-Reacting Material 197 (CRM197) and to Tetanus Toxoid heavy chain (1THc) molecules, and subsequently used to immunize C3H/HeN mice. Following the challenge with 10(5) spirochetes/mouse via subcutaneous inoculation, TTHc:PepB construct showed protection in 66% of the immunized animals. Hence, to further evaluate the efficacy of TTHc:PepB, immunized mice were challenged with B. burgdorferi using the tick model of infection. The outcome of this experiment revealed that serum from TTHc:PepB immunized mice was borrelicidal. After tick infection, bacterial burden was significantly reduced (over 70%) in vaccinated animals when compared with the control groups regardless of whether the mice were infested 8 or 12-weeks post-priming. Therefore, we conclude that PepB conjugated antigens can serve as an alternative to prevent LD; nevertheless, further studies will be needed to dissect the mechanisms by which anti-PepB IgG antibodies are able to kill B. burgdorferi in vitro and in vivo to further advance in the development of formulations and delivery alternative to generate a safe anti-LD vaccine.

AB Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis autochthonous to Latin America and endemic to Brazil, which has the majority of the PCM cases. PCM is acquired through the inhalation of propagules of fungi from genus Paracoccidioides spp. and mainly affects the lungs. We have previously shown that P. brasiliensis-infected mice treated with single-dose of recombinant 60-kDa-heat shock protein from P. brasiliensis (rPbHsp60) had a worsening infection in comparison to animals only infected. In this study, we investigate whether the treatment of infected mice with PB_HSP60 gene cloned into a plasmid (pVAX1-PB_HSP60) would result in efficient immune response and better control of the disease. The harmful impact of single-dose therapy with protein was not seen with plasmid preparations. Most importantly, three doses of pVAX1-PB_HSP60 and protein induced a beneficial effect in experimental PCM with a reduction in fungal load and lung injury when compared with infected mice treated with pVAX1 or PBS. The increase of the cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL-17 and the decrease of IL-10 observed after treatment with three doses of pVAX1-PB_HSP60 appears to be responsible for the control of infection. These results open perspectives of the therapeutic use of Hsp60 in PCM. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Identifying inequalities in childhood immunisation uptake and timeliness

AB Background: In 2018, there was a record incidence of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases across developed countries. Declining childhood immunisation uptake in southeast Scotland-an area with a large, highly mobile, and socioeconomically diverse population-threatens regional herd immunity and warrants investigation of suboptimal coverage. As deprivation of social and material resources increases risk of non-vaccination, we examined here the relationship between deprivation, uptake, and timeliness for four routine childhood vaccines and identified trends over the past decade.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study analysed immunisation data from the Scottish Immunisation Recall System (SIRS) for four routine childhood vaccines in the UK: the third dose of the primary vaccine (TPV), both doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR 1 and MMR 2), and the preschool booster (PSB). Immunisations (N = 329,897) were administered between 2008 and 2018. Deprivation was measured via the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), ranking postcodes by deprivation decile. Chi-squared tests and cox proportional hazards models assessed the relationship between uptake, timeliness, and deprivation.
   Results: There is strong evidence for an association between deprivation, uptake, and timeliness. Uptake for all childhood immunisations are very high, especially for TPV and MMR 1 (>98.0%), though certain deprivation deciles exhibit increased risks of non-vaccination for all vaccines. Delay was pronounced for the 40% most deprived population and for immunisations scheduled at later ages. Absolute PSB and MMR 2 uptake has improved since 2008; however, disparities in uptake have increased for all vaccines since the 2006 birth cohort.
   Conclusion: Both timeliness and uptake are strongly associated with deprivation. While absolute uptake was high for all vaccines, relative uptake and timeliness has been worsening for most groups; the reason for this decline is unclear. Here we identified subgroups that may require targeted interventions to facilitate uptake and timeliness for essential childhood vaccines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) nasopharyngeal carriage studies are important to understand SP circulation prior to implementation of vaccination programs. It is generally not known how stable these carriage rates are over time.
   Carriage studies were conducted in Southern Israel during a decade preceding Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) introduction. We estimated total and vaccine-type SP carriage at 6 months of age to be stable at 35% (95% CI: 26, 44) and 19% (95% CI: 15, 24), respectively in Jewish and 70% (95% Cl, 62, 77) and 41% (95% CI: 38, 45) in Bedouin populations.
   The stability of carriage rates in two disparate populations over 10 years suggests a single survey may be sufficient to characterize pneumococcal carriage pre-PCV. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) causes significant burden of HPV-related diseases, which are more prevalent in immunosuppressed compared to immunocompetent people. We conducted a multi-centre clinical trial to determine the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of HPV vaccine in immunocompromised children. Here we present the immunogenicity results 5 years post vaccination.
   Methods: We followed up immunocompromised children (5-18 years) with a range of specified underlying conditions who were previously recruited from three Australian paediatric hospitals. Participants received three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil Quadrivalent HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18) and were followed up between 2007 and 2016 (60 months post-vaccination). The immunogenicity primary outcome was seroconversion and geometric mean titres (GMT) of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine serotypes in the study.
   Results: Of the 59 original participants, 37 were followed up at 60 months. The proportion of participants who seroconverted were: 86.5%, 89.2%, 89.2%, 91.9% by competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) and 83.8%, 83.8%, 94.6%, 78.4% by total immunoglobulin G assays (IgG) for serotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18 respectively. GMT values ranged from 118 (95%CI: 79-177) for serotype 11, to 373 (95%CI: 215-649) for serotype 16 by cLIA. For IgG, serotype 16 had the highest GMT of 261 (95%CI: 143-477) and serotype 18 had the lowest value of 37 (95%CI: 21-68). All antibody titres were lower in females compared to males but the difference was not statistically significant except for serotype 16. No serious adverse event was reported during this follow-up period.
   Conclusion: Our evidence, although limited by small numbers, is reassuring that a three dose schedule of HPV vaccine remains immunogenic in immunocompromised children to five years post vaccination. Large scale studies are required to determine long term protection in immunocompromised children. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: In light of the decline in childhood vaccination coverage, the question rises concerning what factors play a role in informed decision-making about childhood vaccination. Insight into factors related to this decision helps us to support parents' informed decision-making about childhood vaccination.
   Method: We conducted 12 semi-structured focus group interviews across the Netherlands based on a definition of informed decision-making: three with acceptors, three with refusers, and six with partial acceptors to ask about knowledge, attitudes, deliberation, and information needs. We performed a thematic analysis of the transcripts.
   Results: Acceptors viewed the decision to participate in the National Immunization Program (NIP) as self-evident. Refusers and partial acceptors, however, reported to extensively deliberate the pros and cons of accepting or refusing the NIP in much detail. Their answers indicated that their knowledge was not always evidence-based. In addition, refusers and partial acceptors perceived fewer risks of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs), more risks of side-effects of vaccines, less social support from their environment, less trust in child welfare centers (CWCs), and information provided than acceptors.
   Conclusion: We observed distinct differences in factors related to decision-making about childhood vaccination between acceptors, refusers, and partial acceptors. Acceptors in the current study perceived accepting childhood vaccinations as self-evident, refusers relied mostly on anecdotal information rather than evidence-based information to weigh up the pros and cons vaccines and the VPDs, and partial acceptors elaborately deliberated the pros and cons of each vaccine and VPD individually, which was time-consuming and difficult. To strengthen and support decision-making among parents, more elaborate dialogues are needed between Child Vaccine Providers (CVPs) and parents. These discussions could build trust between parents and CVPs, be used to discuss the evidence-based advantages of childhood vaccinations, and to decrease parents' susceptibility to anecdotal information and misperceptions about childhood vaccinations shared by other parents.

AB The safety and immunogenicity of the second generation oral enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) vaccine ETVAX, consisting of inactivated recombinant E. coli strains over-expressing the colonization factors (CFs) CFA/I, CS3, CS5 and CS6 and the heat labile toxoid LCTBA, were evaluated in Bangladeshi volunteers. To enable analysis of antibody responses against multiple vaccine antigens for subsequent use in small sample volumes from children, a sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay for analysis of intestine-derived antibody-secreting cell responses using the antibodies in lymphocyte secretions (ALS) assay was established using Meso Scale Discovery technology.
   Three groups of Bangladeshi adults (n = 15 per group) received two oral doses of ETVAX with or without double mutant LT (dmLT) adjuvant or placebo in the initial part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, age-descending, dose-escalation trial. CF- and LTB-specific ALS and plasma IgA responses were analyzed by ECL and/or ELISA.
   ETVAX was safe and well tolerated in the adults. Magnitudes of IgA ALS responses determined by ECL and ELISA correlated well (r = 0.85 to 0.98 for the five primary antigens, P < 0.001) and ECL was selected as the ALS readout method. ALS IgA responses against each of the primary antigens were detected in 87-100% of vaccinees after the first and in 100% after the second vaccine dose. Plasma IgA responses against different CFs and LTB were observed in 62-93% and 100% of vaccinees, respectively. No statistically significant adjuvant effect of dmLT on antibody responses to any antigen was detected, but the overall anti-genic breadth of the plasma IgA response tended to favor the adjuvanted vaccine when responses to 4 or more or 5 vaccine antigens were considered. Responses in placebo recipients were infrequent and mainly detected against single antigens.
   The promising results in adults supported testing ETVAX in descending age groups of children. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Streptococcus pneumoniae is increasingly recognised as an important cause of bacterial meningitis in the African meningitis belt. The World Health Organization sets guidelines for response to outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis, but there are no current guidelines for outbreaks where S. pneumoniae is implicated. We aimed to evaluate the impact of using a similar response to target outbreaks of vaccine-preventable pneumococcal meningitis in the meningitis belt. Here, we adapt a previous model of reactive vaccination for meningococcal outbreaks to estimate the potential impact of reactive vaccination in a recent pneumococcal meningitis outbreak in the Brong-Ahafo region of central Ghana using weekly line list data on all suspected cases over a period of five months. We determine the sensitivity and specificity of various epidemic thresholds and model the cases and deaths averted by reactive vaccination. An epidemic threshold of 10 suspected cases per 100,000 population per week performed the best, predicting large outbreaks with 100% sensitivity and more than 85% specificity. In this outbreak, reactive vaccination would have prevented a lower number of cases per individual vaccinated (approximately 15,300 doses per case averted) than previously estimated for meningococcal outbreaks. Since the burden of death and disability from pneumococcal meningitis is higher than that from meningococcal meningitis, there may still be merit in considering reactive vaccination for outbreaks of pneumococcal meningitis. More outbreak data are needed to refine our model estimates. Whatever policy is followed, we emphasize the importance of timely laboratory confirmation of suspected cases to enable appropriate decisions about outbreak response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pulmonary endarteritis caused by Dirofilaria immitis and pulmonary hypertension (PH) are closely linked and the determination of PH could be validated to assess the severity and chronicity of the vascular damage, i.e. by the use of the Right Pulmonary Artery Distensibility (RPAD) Index. The aim was to evaluate the RPAD Index in dogs 10 months after the last dose of adulticide. The study included 23 clientowned dogs with heartworm brought for adulticide treatment. Echocardiographic exam was carried out to estimate worm burden, RPAD Index as well as other routine echocardiographic values on day 0 (diagnosis), day 120 (discharge), and 10 months after the last dose of adulticide. No significant differences were observed in the RPAD Index over time, neither when microfilaremic status and parasite burden were evaluated. An RPAD Index < 29% was found in 52.2% of the dogs on day 0, day 120, and 10 months after the last dose of adulticide. Regarding other echocardiographic parameters, only significant differences were observed on tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) values between day 0:day 120 (p = 0.008), and day 0:end of the study (p = 0.037). There was not significant improvement in pulmonary damage 10 months after the elimination of the parasites (p = 0.296), suggesting that, once the endarteritis has developed, the vascular changes are chronic and may not be reversible. The modifications of the TAPSE value suggest an improvement in the systolic function of the right ventricle, after the disappearance of the worms, independently of the presence of PH. The endarteritis causes a decrease in the elasticity in the pulmonary vasculature and an increase in the resistance that, chronically, and depending on the severity, will cause the development of PH and later right heart failure. This complication of the disease is one of the most damaging and frequent, so it is necessary to adequately monitor PH in dogs undergoing adulticide treatment. Furthermore, knowing the pulmonary status could provide valuable information to help provide an objective prognosis and help assess the need to add additional treatments, once the worms have been eliminated.

AB Neospora caninum is a major pathogen of cattle and dogs, and neosporosis is widespread in five continents. In this study effect of experimental neosporosis on sperm quality of C57BL/6 mice in different days was investigated. Based on the results sperm concentration was not changed in infected groups but neosporosis induced a significant decrease in epididymis sperm motility at 60 days post infection. A significant increase in the number of abnormal sperms at five, 15, 30 and 60 days post infection was found. At days 15, 30 and 60 post infection testosterone concentrations were significantly low in infected groups and FSH level was significantly high in infected groups at five and 30 days post infection. LH level was decreased in infected groups, but the difference was significant at five, 15 and 30 days post infection. Comparison of TSH and T4 levels between groups revealed a significant decrease in infected groups at five, 15, 30 and 60 days post infection. Except 15 days post infection T3 levels decreased significantly in infected groups. GPX activity, MDA and TAC level was significantly increased in infected mice at five days post infection. In this study neosporosis is associated with hypogonadotrophic gonadal insufficiency in infected C57BL/6 male mice.

AB Heartworm infection (also known as dirofilariosis due to Dirofilaria immitis) in dogs causes chronic pulmonary disease that, if left untreated, can lead to right-side congestive heart failure. Currently, the only registered drug for adulticide therapy in dogs with heartworm disease (HWD) is melarsomine dihydrochloride. The recent targeting of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia, through antibiotic therapy of the infected host, has offered an interesting alternative for the treatment of HWD. Recent reports of the adulticide activity of an ivermectin/doxycycline combination protocol has lead the American Heartworm Society (AHS) to include in its guidelines that, in cases where arsenical therapy is not possible or is contraindicated, a monthly heartworm preventive along with doxycycline for a 4-week period might be considered. In the present study, 20 dogs with confirmed natural D. immitis infection were included following owner consent. Fourteen dogs were treated with a topical formulation containing 10% w/v imidacloprid and 2.5% w/v moxidectin (Advocate (R), Advantage Multi (R), Bayer), monthly for nine months, associated to doxycycline (10 mg/kg/BID) for the first 30 days. Six dogs were treated with melarsomine (Immiticide (R), Medal) (2.5 mg/kg) at enrollment, followed one month later by two injections 24 h apart.
   The presence of circulating antigens and the number of microfilariae (mf) were evaluated at the moment of enrollment and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 18, 24 months post enrollment. Echocardiogram and radiographs were performed at month 0, 6, 12, 18, 24.
   Monthly moxidectin combined with 30 days of doxycycline eliminated circulating microfilariae within one month, thus breaking the transmission cycle very quickly. Furthermore, dogs treated with the combination protocol started to become negative for circulating antigens at 4 months from the beginning of treatment and all except one were antigen negative at 9 months. All dogs treated with melarsomine were antigen negative by 5 months from the beginning of the treatment. No dogs showed worsening of pulmonary patterns or criteria indicative of pulmonary hypertension 12 to 24 months after. For the criteria mf concentration, antigen concentration, radiography and echocardiography at 12, 18 and 24 months the non-inferiority for the moxidectin group could be proven for a non-inferiority margin of 15% for the rate difference. Dogs treated with moxidectin and doxycycline became negative for microfilariae and antigens sooner when compared to melarsomine in the present study and to dogs treated with doxycycline combined with ivermectin in studies previously published.

AB The protozoan parasite Tritrichomonas foetus may cause severe diarrhea in cats all over the world. In order to evaluate the methodology in coprological molecular diagnosis of feline tritrichomonosis, we compared previously published ("old") and newly developed ("novel") loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (targeted to the T. foetus beta-tubulin and the elf1 alpha 1 gene, respectively) as well as an old conventional and an old and novel real-time PCR (all targeted to overlapping regions of T. foetus rDNA) assays regarding their diagnostic sensitivities and specificities. Here, the novel real-time PCR yielded the best methodical performance in that a sensitivity with a detection limit of <= 0.1 trophozoites (corresponding to ca. <= 0.13 trophozoites per mg feces) and a maximal specificity for diagnosis of Tritrichomonas spp. was achieved. The other test systems exhibited either an approximately 10-times lower sensitivity (<= 1 trophozoite corresponding to ca. <= 1.3 trophozoites per mg feces) (conventional PCR and both LAMP assays) or a lower specificity (old real-time PCR). Conversely, the diagnostic performance assessed with clinical fecal samples from cats demonstrated identical sensitivities (8 of 20 samples tested were positive) for the novel PCR and both LAMP assays. Diagnostic sensitivities were significantly higher than those found for the old real-time (5 positive samples) and conventional PCR (6 positive samples), respectively. Accordingly, our data suggested the novel PCR and both LAMP assays to be well suited molecular tools for direct (i.e. without including an in vitro cultivation step) coprological diagnosis of tritrichomonosis in cats. Interestingly, relative high (novel LAMP, 7 positive samples) to at least moderate (old LAMP, 6 positive samples and 1 sample with equivocal score) diagnostic sensitivities were also achieved by testing clinical samples upon simple visual inspection of colorimetric changes during the LAMP amplification reactions. Accordingly, both LAMP assays may serve as practical molecular tools to perform epidemiological studies on feline (and bovine as well as porcine) tritrichomonosis under simple laboratory conditions.

AB Haemonchus contortus, one of the most pathogenic of all small ruminant parasites, have developed resistance to all used anthelmintics. Detoxification enzymes, e.g. cytochromes P450 (CYPs) and efflux transporters P-glycoproteins (P-gps), which represent the main defense system against harmful xenobiotics, have been suggested to contribute to drug resistance development. The present study was designed to compare the constitutive expression of individual CYPs and P-gps in females and males of H. contortus adults and to follow up on the changes in expression of these genes in nematodes exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of ivermectin (IVM), which might occur during inaccurate treatment. The adults of inbred susceptible-Edinburgh strain (ISE, MHco3) of H. contortus were used for this purpose. The nematodes were incubated ex vivo with or without 1VM (1, 10 and 100 nM) in culture medium for 4, 12 and 24 h. After incubation, total RNA was isolated and expression levels of individual CYPs and P-gps were analyzed using qPCR. Our results showed a great variability in the constitutive expression of individual CYPs and P-gps in H. contortus adults. The constitutive expression as well as the inducibility of CYPs and P-gps significantly differed in males and females. Contact of adult nematodes with sublethal IVM concentrations led to only minor changes in expression of CYPs, while expression of several P-gps, particularly pgp-9.2 in males and pgp-10, pgp-11 in females was increased significantly in IVM-exposed nematodes. In conclusion, inaccurate treatment of sheep with IVM might contribute to drug resistance development via increased expression of efflux transporters in H. contortus adults.

AB This study looked to assess the stability of Cryptosporidium parvum genotypes in calves between the final day of treatment with the antiprotozoal halofuginone lactate and seven days post-treatment. Paired faecal samples were collected on the final day of treatment and seven days later from 54 calves across seven farms in South-west England. The presence of Cryptosporidium species was detected using polymerase chain reaction targeting the 18 s rDNA. The presence and genotype of C. parvum was determined by PCR and amplicon sequencing targeting the gp60 locus. On farms where C. parvum was detected at both sampling times there was a distinct genotype shift. Detection of gp60 genotype IlaA15G2R1 decreased from 40% to 7% while IlaA17G1R1 increased from 0% to 41%, supplemented by IlaA16G3R1 in one sample. A shift in C. parvum genotypes present in calves within a one week sampling timeframe has not been described prior to this study, indicating that the timeframe is likely suitable for observing variation in C. parvum populations and interactions with antiprotozoal control strategies.

AB Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus ticks cause major constraints to public and livestock health, and serious economic losses. It is well known that the immune response to infestations with cattle ticks is influenced by the host genetic background leading to distinct immunological profiles between bovine hosts genetically susceptible and resistant. The influence of Bos indicus (Bi) and Bos taurus (Bt) maternal lineage ancestry of mitochondrial DNA in the profile of the immune response of Zebu cattle to ticks remains unknown. The present work evaluated the hematological parameters and the immune response profile in the peripheral blood of a Guzerat dairy herd, further categorized into two maternal lineage ancestry subgroups (Bi-mtDNA and Bt-mtDNA) after experimental infestation with larvae of R. microplus. Our data demonstrated that although hematological and erythrogram analysis showed a similar profile throughout, some cell populations present a distinct profile between the groups. Especially MON, CD335(+) and CD8(+) T-cells are predominant in Bi-mtDNA. Moreover, an overall picture of R. microplus infestation demonstrated that Bi-mtDNA presented a more efficient and earlier innate immune response. Bi-mtDNA showed a greater number of connections with R. microplus counts and also with the CD25(+) activation marker of the immune response. Bi-mtDNA showed greater number of connections, with an important participation of the innate immune while Bt-mtDNA showed a delay in the immune response. Elucidating the mechanisms by which resistant animals prevent heavy tick infestation is a crucial step in the development of predictive biomarkers for tick resistance for use in selective breeding programs, and is also potentially useful for the development of anti-tick vaccines.

AB Fasciola gigantica and hybrid Fasciola are distributed throughout Asia. Herein, we investigated the species of the Fasciola fluke distributed in three hotspots of fascioliasis in Cambodia. A total of 92 flukes collected from 21 slaughtered cattle from Kandal (44), Battambang (41), and Kratie (7) Provinces were identified as F. gigantica using multiplex PCR for a nuclear phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene. The overall prevalence of F. gigantica infestation was 7.14% (21/294). Phylogenetic as well as population genetics analyses were performed using the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1). The 19 ND1 haplotypes were identified from Cambodian F. gigantica (haplotype diversity, 0.83). All of the haplotypes were classified into F. gigantica haplogroup C, which includes ND1 haplotypes detected from Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar, and China. Among haplogroup C, novel and unique haplotypes of Cambodia were found in the Battambang and Kandal Provinces, and the nucleotide diversity of the Cambodian population (0.00532) was the highest. Pairwise fixation indices among the F. gigantica populations from these countries indicated that the Cambodian and Thailand populations were related to each other. The highest genetic diversity in the Cambodian population suggests that F. gigantica in Cambodia may be the ancestor of the populations in Southeast Asian countries. Most likely, livestock movement, including Zebu cattle, played an important role in the transmission of F. gigantica. In this study, the hybrid Fasciola flukes that are commonly found in neighboring countries, were not found in Cambodia. Further comprehensive investigations of Fasciola prevalence should be conducted by analyzing a wider range of hosts throughout Cambodia to reach a more solid conclusion about the absence of hybrid flukes.

AB Gastrointestinal parasites, Parascaris sp. and strongyles, are common in young horses worldwide and control of these parasites is challenged by increasing anthelmintic resistance. Our aim was to identify risk factors for these infections as well as to assess the efficacy of fenbendazole (dose 7.5 mg/kg) and pyrantel embonate (dose 19 mg/kg) against Parascaris sp. We also evaluated association between owner observed symptoms and patent infections with these parasites. Fecal samples were collected from 367 young horses in Finland and a questionnaire study was conducted. Fecal egg counts were performed by Mini-FLOTAC (R) method. Univariable logistic regression models using patent infection status (Yes/No), separately for Parascaris sp. and strongyle infections as an outcome were run initially to screen potential risk factors collected by the questionnaire. After the initial screening, multiple logistic regression models were constructed and run to account for correlated data structure, risk factors and potential confounders simultaneously. Two significant risk factors for a patent Parascaris sp. infection were found: breeding farm size (p = 0.028) and frequency of horse movements (p = 0.010). Horses originating from large breeding farms were more likely (OR = 2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-5.51) to shed Parascaris sp. eggs upon relocation to training stables compared to horses originating from small breeding farms. Horses living in farms with frequent horse movements to other premises had higher odds (OR = 3.56, 95% CI: 1.35-9.39) of a patent Parascaris sp. infection compared to farms with less frequent horse movements. Risk factors for patent strongyle infection included age (p < 0.001) and season (p = 0.017). Horses were less likely (OR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.10-0.66) to shed strongylid eggs during the spring compared to the winter. Horses excreting over 200 ascarid eggs per gram were included in the anthelmintic efficacy trial. A mean FECR less than 90% was interpreted as presence of anthelmintic resistance. The mean FECR was 98.5% (95% CI: 95.8-100) and 68.0% (95% CI: 52.7-83.3) in the fenbendazole (n = 31) and pyrantel (n = 26) treatment groups, respectively. In conclusion, we identified two new risk factors for patent Parascaris sp. infection; breeding farm size and frequency of horse movements. Reduced efficacy of pyrantel against Parascaris sp. was observed for the second time in Europe. A relatively high Parascaris sp. prevalence in yearlings (34%) and two-year-olds (20%) was observed, which has not been reported earlier. An association between symptoms and a patent Parascaris sp. infection was observed in foals.

AB Maternal antibody transmission via placenta and breastmilk are known to confer protection in infants. In this study, we investigated the maternal immunity transmission in pups delivered by rats infected with Trichinella spiralis and assessed the resulting resistance against subsequent parasitic infection. Our results revealed that parasite-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were present in pups prior to breastmilk ingestion (pre-milk), in which IgG and IgG1 antibodies persisted until week 8 after birth while parasite-specific IgG2a antibodies only lasted until week 4. After weaning on week 3, pups delivered by T. spiralis-infected dam and subsequently challenge-infected (immune-challenge) were found to possess higher mucosal IgG antibodies than control groups, whereas mucosal IgA levels were not significantly different across all groups. T. spiralis excretory-secretory antigen was discovered to react with pup sera until week 8, correlating with the resistance against parasitic infection which is represented by lessened worm burden. Upon T. spiralis infection at weeks 3 and 8, lower levels of eosinophil responses were detected in immune-challenge pups compared to naive-challenge pups, indicating correlates of resistances in which ADCC may be involved. Findings from the present study demonstrate that resistances against T. spiralis infection in pups can be acquired by maternally-derived IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibody transmission through the placenta and breastmilk from T. spiralis-infected dam, which lasts until week 8.

AB Suckling calves are prone to Cryptosporidium infection. The variable degree of clinical disease is influenced by keeping conditions and immune status of the host, but diversity of isolate virulence may also contribute. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the cytopathogenic effects of 26 C. parvum field isolates by using a MU assay in HCT-8 cell monolayers. Cell viability of monolayers inoculated with oocysts of the field isolates varied considerably with values of 17.7% (+/- 5.1%) to 99.5% (+/- 7.1%). A standard deviation of 18.6% was detected for cell viability of the in house reference strain, which were tested alongside in every assay. Field isolates were grouped in three categories of cytopathogenicity. Probably the length of storage has an effect on the level of the cell destruction category detected post infection in vitro. The applied tool may help to better understand the variable course of cryptosporidiosis in the field.

AB Tick-borne diseases(TBD) constitute an important group of illness affecting animals and humans worldwide. In Brazil, carthorses are frequently exposed to ticks and tick-borne pathogens, leading to impairment of horse performance and imposing restrictions by the international veterinary authorities for the importation of horses. Accordingly, this study has aimed to i) determine the prevalence of the TBD agents Theileria equi, Babesia caballi, Ehrlichia spp., and hemotropic mycoplasmas in carthorses, ii) identify the tick species parasitizing the animals, and iii) determine factors associated with exposure/infection in Foz do Iguacu City, Parana state, southern Brazil. A total of 103 carthorses were screened for anti-T. equi and anti-Ehrlichia spp. antibodies by indirect fluorescent antibody assays (IFA). Samples were also tested by PCR assays targeting the 18S rRNA gene of T. equi and B. caballi, and 16S rRNA gene of hemoplasmas. Additionally, PCR assays targeting the 16S rRNA, disulfide bond formation protein (dsb) and tandem repeat proteins 36 (trp36) genes of Ehrlichia spp. were also performed. Antibodies to T. equi and Ehrlichia spp. were detected in 43/103 (41.75%; 95% CI: 32.10-51.88%) and 5/103 (4.85%; 95% CI: 1.59-10.97%) horses by IFA, respectively. DNA of T. equi and B. caballi were found in 25/103 (24.27%; 95% CI: 16.36-33.71%) and 10/103 (9.71%; 95% CI: 4.75-17.13%) carthorses, respectively, and all tested negative for Ehrlichia spp. and hemoplasmas. All sequences showed >= 99% identity with multiple T. equi and B. caballi 18S rRNA gene sequences deposited in GenBank. Overall, 191 Dermacentor nitens ticks were collected from 25/103 (24.27%) animals. Carthorses older than 5 years were more likely to be positive for T. equi (p < 0.05). In conclusion, equine piroplasmosis agents are highly prevalent in carthorses from Foz do Iguacu City. The low prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. found may be due to the absence of Amblyomma ticks infesting animals, which should be further investigated.

AB Visceral leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania infantum for which dogs are the main reservoir. In South America, presence of this disease is expanding along with increasing dispersion of its principal vector, the sand-fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. Feline leishmaniasis is an emerging disease in domestic cats, but epidemiological studies in endemic areas of the Amazon region of Brazil are scarce and the role of cats as reservoirs of L. infantum has been debated. The aim of this study was to investigate L. infantum infection in cats living in the Amazon biome region, using serological and molecular methods. A total of 105 cats were subjected to clinical examination and blood samples were taken for immunofluorescent-antibody (1FAT) serological evaluation, to determine anti-Leishmania antibody titers. Conventional PCR and Sanger's sequencing targeting L. infantum chitinase and Leishmania species ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) encoding genes were performed on conjunctival swabs from these cats. Seropositivity was detected in 32 animals (30.48%), thus confirming that contact between these cats and the parasite was occurring. PCR followed by amplicon sequencing showed that three samples (2.86%) were positive for a chitinase gene and six (5.71%) were positive for the ITS-1 gene. Parasite-positive diagnoses presented a statistically significant association with free access to the streets (p = 0.0111), cohabitation with dogs affected previously by VL (p = 0.0006) and absence of backyard cleaning and garbage collection (p = 0.00003). These results emphasize that cats should be included in epidemiological surveys of leishmaniasis, especially in endemic areas, if not as the reservoir host (unproven), at least as a "sentinel host" that is useful for revealing situations of endemic circulation of L. infantum. Moreover, in these areas, feline leishmaniasis needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis among domestic cats presenting alopecia, rarefied hair, lacerations and ulcerative dermatitis.

TI Encysted cyathostomin larval counts: Mucosal digestion revisited

DT Article
DE Cyathostomins; Mucosal digestion; Spatial variation
ID PONIES
AB Cyathostomins are pervasive equine parasites in horses across the world, and larval stages are known to cause the deadly disease larval cyathostominosis. The mucosal digestion technique is widely used for enumeration of encysted larval stages. Previous studies have investigated the spatial variation of encysted larvae, however current protocols lack a description of a standardized area from which to take the tissue sample. This study sought to evaluate spatial variation in encysted cyathostomin larval counts among the large intestinal organs and their subsections. Following humane euthanasia, ceca, ventral, and dorsal colons were harvested from 8 foals (aged 4-8 months) raised in an anthelmintic naive parasitology research herd. Each organ was weighed and separated into 3 equal sections by length: the orad, intermediate, and aborad portions. From each of those sections, two 5% weight tissue samples were collected and digested to quantify the early third stage larvae (EL3) and late third stage larvae/fourth stage larvae (LL3/L4). A mixed model statistical analysis was carried out to evaluate for differences of larval counts among the different organs, sections, and the interaction term between the organs and sections. There were significant differences among organs (P < 0.0001), with the ceca having higher counts than the ventral and dorsal colons. However, there were no significant differences among the three defined organ sections (P = 0.1076). Coefficients of variation (CV) were all calculated to be greater than 1, suggesting a high level of variability among the samples; the least amount of variation can be found in the cecal data with a CV of 1.4024 compared with the ventral colon's 1.529845 and dorsal colon's 3.339135 within the respective organ. The following sections had the highest mean counts of encysted larvae: intermediate cecum, orad ventral colon, and aborad dorsal colon. Though only a portion of the results were significant, trends were observed and these should be investigated further in future studies and potentially employed in larvicidal efficacy evaluations.

AB Tritrichomonas foetus is a common cause of large bowel diarrhea in cats. Probiotics have been suggested to be effective for many intestinal pathogens; however, there are a lack of studies evaluating the effect of probiotics in T. foetus infection. In vitro studies were performed to evaluate the effect of a probiotic containing Enterococcus faecium (Efm) SF68 and a novel probiotic, Enterococcus hirae, on the inhibition of T. foetus growth, adhesion to, and cytotoxicity towards the intestinal epithelium. The effect of enterococci on T. foetus proliferation during co-culture was evaluated throughout log phase T. foetus growth. The previously validated in vitro co-culture model system using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) was used to evaluate the effect of enterococci on T. foetus adhesion and cytotoxicity towards intestinal epithelial cells. Cytotoxicity was assessed using fluorescent microscopy and spectrophotometry. Interactions of T. foetus, enterococci, and intestinal epithelial cells were assessed using scanning electron microscopy and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). Enterococcus-induced inhibition of T. foetus growth was demonstrated at concentrations as low as 104 enterococci colony forming units (CFU)/mL and was dependent, in part, on environmental pH and the presence of viable enterococci organisms. T. foetus adhesion, including with a ronidazole-resistant strain, was reduced with pretreatment of intestinal epithelial cells with enterococci but was not significantly affected when enterococci were introduced simultaneously or following T. foetus infection. Compared to Efm, E. hirae more effectively decreased T. foetus adhesion, suggesting its superior potential as a novel probiotic for T. foetus infection. There was no effect of enterococci treatment on T. foetus-induced intestinal epithelial cell cytotoxicity. Our results support further study into the investigation of a possible benefit of enterococci-containing probiotic treatment for prevention of T. foetus infection in at-risk uninfected cats.

AB This study aimed to investigate the presence of the natural transovarial transmission of tick-borne pathogens in unfed larvae obtained from engorged female ticks from domestic animals in Turkey. Larvae (n = 4530, 151 pools) obtained from 75 engorged female ticks and female carcasses were screened for the presence of certain tick-borne pathogens by PCR. The presence of transovarial transmission of Babesia occultans was detected in Hyalomma marginatum and Hy. excavatum, while Ba. ovis in Rhipicephalus bursa. Theileria annulata was detected only in Hy. excavatum and Rh. turanicus female carcasses, but not in their examined progenies. Additionally, Rickettsia aeschlimannii and Rickettsia raoultii were detected in Hy. marginatum and Dermacentor marginatus females, respectively, and all their examined larvae. Besides, Ri. slovaca was detected in a De. marginatus female carcass and its one of two examined larvae pools. The presence of mixed Ba. occultans and RL aeschlimannii infection was also determined in an Hy. marginatum female and its larvae. This is the first demonstration of transovarial transmission of Ba. occultans in naturally infected Hy. excavatum. These data suggested that Hy. excavatum may act as vector in the natural cycle of Ba. occultans.

AB Diclazuril, which is widely used for the prevention of coccidiosis in chickens, has a lethal effect on asexual and sexual stages of Eimeria spp. However, little is known about its effect on the exogenous stages of Eimeria spp. In this study, we evaluated the effect of in vitro treatment with 0.2% diclazuril on unsporulated and sporulated oocysts of Eimeria spp. For this purpose, a total of 180 male layer chicks aged one day were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups. Each group was divided into 3 replicates of 12 chicks each. Group 1 (G1) and Group 2 (G2) were negative (non-immunized and non-challenged) and positive (non-immunized and challenged) controls, respectively. Group 3 (G3) was immunized per os with 1.0 x 10(4) non-diclazuril treated-sporulated oocysts. Groups 4 (G4) was immunized per os with 0.2% diclazuril treated-unsporulated oocysts (1.0 x 10(4)) in which diclazzuril didn't affect sporulation. Group 5 (G5) was immunized per os with 0.2% diclazuril treated-sporulated oocysts (1.0 x 10(4)). Chicks of G2, G3, G4, and G5 were challenged with 7.5 x 10(4) untreated sporulated oocysts at the age of 21 days, while the group 1 chicks remained unchallenged. G4 and G5 animals immunized with 0.2% diclazuril-treated oocysts showed a significant decrease in bloody diarrhea severity, lesion scores, and oocyst counts in comparison to those immunized with untreated oocysts. Furthermore, histopathologic findings showed a low number of parasitic stages in cecal tissues in G4 and G5. A significant increased body weight gain was observed in Gs 4 and 5 in comparison to G2. In addition, expression levels of IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-gamma were significantly increased in G4 and G5. In conclusion, diclazuril is effective in attenuating Eimeria oocysts and thus provides an alternative approach for using diclazuril-treated oocysts to protect chicks against Eimeria challenge.

AB Toxoplasma gondii is the parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis, a highly prevalent zoonosis that affects humans and warm-blooded animals. Faeces of infected cats can contain millions of T. gondii oocysts, which remain infectious in the environment for months. Sites repeatedly used by cats for defecation (latrines') are recognised as hotspots of T. gondii soil contamination, but this contamination varies from one latrine to another. To understand this spatial heterogeneity, camera traps were deployed in 39 cat latrines on three dairy farms with high density cat populations and programmed to record visits during sixteen 10-day sessions, rotating between three farms over a period of a year. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to test the effects of cat sexual maturity, latrine location and season on the number of cat faeces deposited and on the number of cats defecating per latrine, as determined from the analysis of 41,282 video recordings. Sexually immature cats defecated 6.60 fold (95% CI = [2.87-15.25]) more often in latrines located close to a feeding site than in other latrines. This pattern was also observed for mature males (odds ratio [OR] = 9.42, 95% CI = [3.29-26.91]), especially during winter, but not for mature females (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = [0.80-3.94]). The number of defecating cats was also 2.67-fold (95% Cl = [1.66-4.30], P < 0.001) higher in latrines located close to a feeding point than in those located far from it, regardless of cat category and season. Visits by intermediate T. gondii hosts (micromammals, birds and others) were also recorded. Out of the 39 latrines, 30 (76.92%) were visited by at least one intermediate host during the study period, and some latrines were highly frequented (up to 8.74 visits/day on average). These results provide evidence that the location of food resources in dairy farms influences the latrine use pattern by cats. Highly frequented latrines can be of high risk of T. gondii infection for definitive and intermediate hosts.

AB Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) represents the optically active component of the DOM pool, and originates from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources. The fluorescent characteristics of dissolved organic matter (FDOM) has been widely used to trace CDOM sources and infer its composition. However, little is known about the optical and fluorescent properties of CDOM in drinking water reservoirs, and the variability of CDOM properties along trophic gradients in these aquatic systems. A total of 536 water samples were collected between 2015 and 2017 from 131 reservoirs across China to characterize CDOM and FDOM properties using both light absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, and examine relationships with water-quality condition as expressed by the modified trophic state index (TSIM) of the reservoirs (range: 12 < TSIM < 78). With increased reservoir trophic status, CDOM absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a(CDOM)(254)) and total fluorescence of FRI-EEMs (excitation-emission matrix coupled with fluorescence regional integration) increased significantly (p < 0.01). Our results indicated that the nutrients in aquatic systems and the social economy factors (including wastewater, sewage, cultivated land, GDP, population) and altitude affect the CDOM absorption and fluorescence significantly (p < 0.05). Most importantly, we proposed a new classification standard associated with eutrophic status via CDOM humification index (HIX) due to the significant correlation between each other (p < 0.01). HIX less than 4 was corresponding to TSIM less than 30 as oligotrophic states; 4 < HIX <= 12 was corresponding to TSIM less than 50 as mesotrophic states; 12 < HIX <= 18 was corresponding to TSIM less than 70 as eutrophic states; HIX more than 18 is defined as hypereutrophic status with TSIM > 70. This method highlights the importance of CDOM fluorescence for aquatic DOM input and strengthens the linkage between the trophic status index and CDOM characteristics, it also contributes to establish a new rapid assessing model with quick experimental measurements to monitor the trophic status of water reservoirs.

AB Joint multifractal spectrum analysis (JMS) is an effective approach for investigation of relationship among hydrological variables and is regarded as one potential way to reveal nonlinear relationship in hydrology. In this study, the joint multifractal spectrum analysis was for the first time used to analyze soil moisture-soil temperature-precipitation (SM-ST-P) relationship. Pearson's linear correlation coefficient considering lag effects and scale effects was also applied for the aims of comparison. Soil data were collected at four sites in Tibet and three depths for each site (10 cm, 30 cm and 60 cm) at 2-hourly frequency from November 2016 to November 2017. Correlation analysis showed that the coefficients varied at every measurement point but failed to provide general and comprehensive analysis of SM-ST-P relationship. On the contrary, multifractal spectra of SM-ST-P confirmed that the relationship was strong for all measurement points. Furthermore, JMS analysis provided holistic results including verification of multifractal of SM-ST-P relationship, relationship evaluation for each part of variables separately (high value, middle value, low value), intuitive diagrammatic comparison of SM-ST and SM-P relationships, etc. Seasonal JMS analysis was adopted to investigate the freezing-thawing process in the study area as well. The multifractal spectra of frozen soil site and no frozen soil site are totally different for dry cold period but similar for rainy warm period. The difference in multifractal of SM-ST-P relationship with and without frozen soil presented the latent application of JMS to quantitatively detect the process of frozen soil. This study implied the capability of JMS analysis in hydrology, especially for multivariable relationship like SM-ST-P relationship.

AB Nitrate in groundwater is increasing in many aquifers worldwide due to excessive use of fertilizers. However, the behavior of N-based fertilizer as it leaches through thick vadose zones is still poorly understood, and the longterm effects on groundwater quality in such settings may yet to be fully realized. In this study, deep soil cores were taken below experimental plots where N-fertilizer was applied for nearly 20 years under wheat-maize double cropping in the North China Plain (NCP). N-fertilizer application rates of zero, 400, and 600 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1) were applied to different plots. Water and N balances were quantified to estimate the leaching rate of NO3- -N below the root zone, and NO3-N loss via denitrification. Transport pathways of nitrate in the vadose zone were identified using stable isotopes of water (delta O-18-H2O & delta H-2-H2O) and nitrate (delta O-18-NO3 & delta N-18-NO3-) from the sampled pore-water and groundwater. The average N transport velocity through the vadose zone ranged from 38 to 41 cm yr(-1) and was relatively constant regardless of fertilizer application rate. The transport rates are significantly lower than the long-term rate of groundwater level decline (100 cm yr(-1)), meaning it is unlikely much of the leachate from chemical N-fertilizers (abundantly applied throughout the region since the 1970s) has entered groundwater via matrix flow. Nitrate isotopes appear to indicate that manure and septic waste (not chemical N-fertilizer) are the major sources of nitrate in groundwater to date. However, stable isotopes show that increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater may also result due to preferential flow in sand layers and/or lateral flow from headwater areas. Denitrification (particularly in the upper 4 m depth of soil) appears to have limited the flux of fertilizer-derived nitrate to some degree. However, the large N stock and generally weak denitrification potential in the deep unsaturated zone, pose a major threat to future groundwater quality. The results have major implications for groundwater quality management in the future.

AB Debris is known to influence the ablation, topography and hydrological systems of glaciers. This paper determines for the first time how these influences impact on bulk water routing and the proglacial runoff signal, using analyses of supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry and proglacial discharge at Miage Glacier, Italian Alps. Debris does influence the supraglacial water chemistry, but the inefficient subglacial system beneath the debris-covered zone also plays a role in increasing the ion contribution to the proglacial stream. Daily hydrographs had a lower amplitude and later discharge peak compared to clean glaciers and fewer diurnal hydrographs were found compared to similar analysis for Haut Glacier d'Arolla. We attribute these observations to the attenuating effect of the debris on ablation, smaller input streams on the debris-covered area, a less efficient subglacial system, and possible leakage into a raised sediment bed beneath the glacier. Strongly diurnal hydrographs are constrained to periods with warmer than average conditions. 'Average' weather conditions result in a hydrograph with reverse asymmetry. Conductivity and discharge commonly show anti-clockwise hysteresis, suggesting the more dilute, rapidly-routed melt component from the mid-glacier peaks before the discharge peak, with components from higher up-glacier and the debris-covered areas arriving later at the proglacial stream. The results of this study could lead to a greater understanding of the hydrological structure of other debris-covered glaciers, with findings highlighting the need to include the influence of the debris cover within future models of debris-covered glacier runoff.

AB Accurate and reliable measurements of field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs) are essential for accurate determinations of soil and solution water fluxes. K(fs)( )is a crucial parameter to design drainage, irrigation systems and many other environmental, agricultural and industrial installations Reynolds et al. (1983). There is a high demand for K-fs data. Its evaluation is preferable to be done in situ. A popular device to measure the K-fs is the head well permeameter such as the Guelph Permeameter. However, it is an analog equipment based on a Mariotte's bottle that requires full attention and training to be manually operated, where the reading of the flux values (Q, in cm(3)/min) is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we describe a device, with a digital readout, to measure the steady state rate of water level change Rs, in order to obtain Q(s) and K-fs. The method is based on the monitoring of the vacuum variation of the Mariotte's bottle. Our results show no statistical differences between the measurements values of manual and automatic recording using paired t-test. In addition, our device identifies measurement artifacts due to the variation of the ambient temperature during measurements. The necessary accuracy for the digitalization method becomes feasible due to the availability of accurate piezoelectric transducers (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System - MEMS). Automating and digitizing these processes will reduce time, costs and increase the accuracy and availability of data. The device can be directly adapted to commercially available head well permeameters as shown in our experimental results. The more widespread use and understanding of this parameter can improve the rational use of water for irrigation and use in risk models for forecasting available soil water and therefore crop productivity.

AB Cities across the world are increasingly utilizing green infrastructure practices as part of their stormwater management programs. Bioretention areas have become a popular green infrastructure practice due to their widespread success in improving water quality and reducing runoff generated from impervious surfaces. Several studies have demonstrated that pollutant removal performance can be improved when plants are included in bioretention design; however, while numerous benefits of trees in urban areas have been identified, little knowledge of their contributions to stormwater management in green infrastructure currently exists. To address this need, a controlled mesocosm experiment was conducted to characterize the degree of stormwater treatment provided by bioretention columns planted with one of three native tree species commonly found across the eastern United States (Ater rubrum - red maple, Pinus taeda - loblolly pine, and Quercus palustris - pin oak). Tree pollutant removal performance was compared to nonvegetated mesocosms using a semi-synthetic stormwater mixture applied to the mesocosms over a period of 17 weeks. The hydrologic benefits of each species were characterized using data-logging scales placed below the mesocosms to compare evapotranspiration (ET) rates and drainage in each configuration. Differences in pollutant removal between tree species were largely not significant, indicating the dominant role of the bioretention media in mitigating dissolved and particle-bound constituents. Mesocosms planted with red maple (Acer rubrum) had significantly greater average ET rates (3.2 mm d(-1)) than all other configurations, attributable to plant development and increased growth and canopy size. All mesocosms planted with trees had significantly higher ET rates than the nonvegetated mesocosms, illustrating the role of transpiration in bioretention hydrology which, depending on species, accounted for 8.2-37.5% of average daily water losses from the mesocosms during testing. These results suggest that trees contribute to bioretention hydrology through evapotranspiration, and that significant differences between species exist and are likely related to growth rate.

AB A large part of total solid flux is transported as suspension in mountainous rivers. It is crucial for water resource management and for environmental issues to be able to model and to understand these fluxes. However, suspended load is known to be highly variable in time and space, as fine sediments can originate from various erosion processes and from various sources. Among the different methodologies available for analyzing the suspended sediment flux dynamics, hysteretic loops in discharge and suspended load signals are commonly used to assess sediment sources and production processes. However, the shape of these loops is often analyzed qualitatively for a single or a small number of catchments. Hence it is still unclear how the geomorphological catchment properties influence the variability of the flow rate - suspended sediment concentration relationship through the hysteresis effects. This is particularly true in mountainous catchments where important sources of fine sediments may originate from the river bed in addition to hillslopes.
   In this study we analyzed quantitatively ten long-term series of high-frequency observations of suspended sediment load measured in contrasted alpine catchments. Hysteresis effects were analyzed in a high number of automated sampled events and the dominant response for each catchment was sought. This was done by using a normalized hysteresis index developed by Lloyd et al. (2016), which we weighted by the mass transported during each event. The various catchments were characterized with a normalized geomorphological index expressing the relative importance of sediment sources originating from the river bed or from eroded areas as a function of the distance to the outlet of the catchment.
   The dominant hysteresis response of the ten alpine catchments studied was found to be greatly linked to their geomorphological index. These results suggest that the sediment source configuration upstream of a measuring station drives hysteresis effects and thus the variability of the flow rate-suspended sediment concentration relationship.

AB This study focused on the utility of coarse surface soil moisture observations for applications that require high resolution surface soil moisture information. This was accomplished by quantifying the information content of average soil moisture for three different spatial scales of 81 km(2), 790 km(2), and 4400 km(2). In situ point observations of soil moisture from 31 stations in Iowa were used to develop a spatial stochastic model that assumes hillslope-scale model parameters are independent. Soil moisture dry-downs and wetting regimes were analyzed using rain gauge and soil moisture sensor data. The statistical nature of dry-downs were parameterized using a power-law decay, and soil moisture increases due to rainfall were parameterized using a non-dimensional logistic curve that is a function of soil moisture deficit. The resulting stochastic model is used to quantify the magnitude of the standard deviation, sigma(theta), and skewness G(theta) as a function of the areal average. We show that the greatest information content (small spatial standard deviation) of average observation corresponded to values near the minimum or the maximum soil moisture with sigma(theta) < 5%, while average observations for intermediate soil moisture values had the lowest information content with sigma(theta) > 20%. The differences in information content as a function of the areal average were consistent with the statistical nature of soil moisture that can be interpreted as small range bounded variable. However, this study provides quantitative estimates for the magnitude of the sub-grid and basin scale variability, documenting the utility for applications that require high resolution information. These results form the basis for the investigation of spatial runoff production in response to rainfall and to inform plot scale agriculture applications.

AB Hydrological modelling is a challenging and significant issue, especially in nonhomogeneous catchments in terms of geology, and it is an essential part of water resources management. In this study, daily rainfall-runoff modelling was carried out using the lumped conceptual model, the artificial neural network (ANN), the deep-neural network (DNN), and regression tree (RT) data mining models for the nonhomogeneous karst Ljubljanica catchment and four of its sub-catchments in Slovenia with different geological characteristics. Model performance was evaluated using several performance criteria and additional investigation of low and high flows was carried out. The results of the study indicate that the Genie Rural a 4 parametres Journalier (GR4J) lumped conceptual model yielded better modelling performance compared to the data-driven models, namely ANN, DNN and RT models. Moreover, the enhanced version of the GR4J model (i.e. GR6J) also yielded good performance in terms of the recession part. The RT model yielded the worst performance regarding runoff forecasting among the examined models in the case of all five investigated catchments. However, ANN and DNN data-driven models were slightly more successful in modelling the hydrograph recession in the case of karst sub-catchments compared to the GR4J lumped conceptual model structure. Inclusion of additional meteorological variables to ANN and DNN does not significantly improve modelling results.

   approach; Climate change impact assessment; Realistic perturbed

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; OPTIMIZATION
AB Scenario-neutral approaches are used increasingly as a means of stress-testing climate-sensitive systems to a range of plausible future climate conditions. To ensure that these stress-tests are able to explore system vulnerability, it is necessary to generate hydrometeorological time series that represent all aspects of plausible future change (e.g. averages, seasonality, extremes). A promising approach to generating these time series is by inverting the stochastic weather generation problem to obtain weather time series that capture all the relevant statistical features of plausible future change. The objective of this paper is to formalize this "inverse" approach to weather generation, by both characterizing the process of optimizing weather generator parameters and proposing a numerically efficient solution that exploits prior knowledge and accounts for the complexity of the optimization landscape. The proposed approach also provides a structured way to ensure the physical realism of the generated weather time series, by using penalty-based objective functions to focus the optimization on the climate features deemed most relevant to the system being analyzed. A case study in Adelaide, Australia, is used to demonstrate specific implementations of this approach. The use of bounds on the weather generators dramatically decreases the time taken to create time series, and the use of penalties is shown to allow for change in some statistics to be prioritized, while still ensuring the realism of the time series.

AB In drylands, evapotranspiration (ET) is the dominant ecohydrologic process. For this reason, partitioning of ET-determining the relative importance of interception (I), soil evaporation (E), and plant transpiration (T)-is critical, but remains a challenge. Recently, however, advances in measurement technologies and data availability have triggered an upsurge in in situ studies focused on quantifying T/ET. We carried out a meta-analysis of 38 datasets drawn from 31 studies done in drylands worldwide. This analysis showed that over the growing season, E and T are roughly equivalent for most natural ecosystems, whereas T/ET is higher in irrigated agro-ecosystems. With respect to factors controlling variations in T/ET, we found (1) no clear correlation for annual precipitation, soil texture, or ecosystem type; (2) leaf area index is a more significant controlling factor than fractional cover; and (3) T/ET varies most during dynamic wetting-drying episodes. We also found that controlling factors are different for E and T. Because these two processes differ in temporal dynamics, the factors controlling ET partitioning vary with temporal scale. Further, when interception and shallow groundwater are substantial, including these factors is essential for accurate T/ET quantification. The isotopic approach, especially using laser spectroscopy, is now indispensable for such studies. However, issues related to sampling protocols and quality assurance still must be resolved. We propose three promising areas for future studies in drylands: (1) isotopic sampling of vadose-zone water vapor using laser spectroscopy; (2) improved definition/identification of diffusive pathways; and (3) robust upscaling from incongruent hydrometric and isotopic measurements.

AB This study deals with the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters through a heterogeneous soil profile, which is often required in many applications such as designing a monitoring network, developing a remediation strategy for contaminated sites, and determining the associated risks of subsurface contamination. The main objective is to determine relative contributions to the output uncertainty of advective travel time from individual input stochastic hydraulic parameters. A new approach is developed to examine the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive as a result of infiltration from a wet and contaminated surface source. The approach can be applied to both non-stationary layered formation and stationary soil profile. The results demonstrate that the advective contaminant travel time is sensitive to the layers with small saturated hydraulic conductivity and small macroscopic capillary drive values. Larger uncertainty of saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive shifts the sensitive layers to the advective travel time to deeper layers. Correlation range of saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive has less significant impact on the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time than the standard deviation. In the stationary saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive profile, although the advective contaminant travel time increase significantly for fine textured soil compared to coarse textured soil, the fractional contribution of spatial locations to the overall uncertainty of total advective travel time is virtually identical for both fine textured and coarse textured soils.

AB The September 12, 2016 Gyeongju earthquakes (M-L = 5.1 of foreshock and My = 5.8 of mainshock) had significant effects on groundwater systems along the Yangsan Fault System composed of NNE-trending, right-lateral strike-slip faults in Korea. Hydrological changes induced by the earthquakes are important because no surface ruptures have been reported and few earthquakes usually occur in Korea. The main objective of this research was to propose a conceptual model interpreting the possible mechanisms of groundwater response to the earthquakes based on anomalous hydrogeochemical data including isotope concentrations with lithostratigraphic classification. For this, annual monitoring data (groundwater level, temperature, and electrical conductivity) and collected data (hydrochemical parameters, radon-222, and strontium isotopes) were used. Groundwater level anomalies could be attributed to the movement of the epicentral strike-slip fault. Radon concentration data showed the potential of groundwater mixing processes. Strontium anomalies could be related to the lithology and stratigraphy of the bedrock, reflecting the effect of water-rock interaction. Using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) statistical analysis, associations of hydro-geochemical characteristics among groundwater wells were interpreted. By combining the grouped results of the SOM with lithostratigraphic unit data, 21 groundwater wells were classified into four groups, each corresponding to different hydrogeological behaviors. A new comprehensive conceptual model was developed to explain possible mechanisms for the hydrological and geochemical responses in each group, which have been respectively identified as water-rock interaction, mixing of shallow and deep aquifers via sea water intrusion, bedrock fracture opening related to strike-slip fault movement, and no response.

AB New and improved drought models based on the World Meteorological Organization approved Standardized Precipitation Index, principally at multiple timescale horizons, are providing significant benefits to the hydrological community, by its widespread acceptance in the sub-field of water resources management, sustainable water use and precision agriculture. In this research paper, the existing challenges faced by a drought forecasting model trained at multiple time-scales are resolved where a new multi-phase, multivariate empirical mode decomposition model integrated with simulated annealing and Kernel ridge regression algorithms (Le., MEMD-SAKRR) is designed to attain significantly accurate drought forecasts for 3 agricultural sites (Le., Faisalabad, Islamabad and Jhelum, located in Pakistan). Utilizing the multi-scalar Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) time series as a target variable for characterization of drought, twelve multivariate datasets (derived from statistically significant lagged combinations of precipitation, temperature & humidity), that are enriched with eight synoptic-scale climate mode indices and periodicity, are utilized in designing a new drought model. The study constructs a hybrid MEMD-SA-KRR model, where firstly, the data are partitioned into their respective training and testing subsets after creating historically lagged SPI at timescale (t-1). Secondly, the MEMD algorithm is conditioned to demarcate multivariate climate indices from their training and testing sets, separately, into their decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residues. Thirdly, the SA method is employed to decide the most suitable IMFs. Finally, the KRR algorithm is applied to the selected IMFs to forecast multi-scaler SPI, at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-monthly forecast horizon. The results are benchmarked with Random Forest, integrated with MEMD and SA to develop the MEMD-SA-RF equivalent model. The multi-phase MEMD-SA-KRR model is tested geographically in Pakistan, revealing that the MEMD-SA-KRR hybrid model generates reliable performance in forecasting multi-scaler SPI series, relative to the comparative models based on error analysis metrics. The hybrid drought model incorporating the most pertinent synoptic-scale climate drivers, as the model inputs has significant implications for hydrological applications and water resources management including its potential use in drought policy and drought recovery plans.

AB In a semi-arid climate, groundwater-fed endorheic lakes often have shallow depths and large areas of associated wetlands. These lake-wetland-aquifer systems are sensitive to land use and climate changes. Difficulties of modeling such systems include (a) tracking several thousand lakes and wetlands (LWs), and (b) evaluating major drivers of trends and fluctuations in LW areal coverage. Integrated hydrologic modeling of such systems is prohibitively expensive. We combine traditional groundwater flow modeling (MODFLOW), driven by modern and projected groundwater recharge (GR) estimates, with digital elevation model (DEM)-based geographic information system (GIS) terrain analyses. This approach can be a useful diagnostic tool for estimates of decade-averaged LW areas and numbers, and stream baseflow, facilitating conceptualization and design of more detailed modeling studies. We apply the approach to simulate dynamics of thousands of groundwater-fed LWs in the Nebraska Sand Hills, USA, under GCM-projected GR changes. Compared to the baseline period of 2000-2009, the model indicates an increase by 35% (from 2083 to 2804 km(2)) of decade-averaged LW area by the end of the 21st century under the Median GR projection, with GR averaging 55.3 mm/yr from 2010 through 2099 (5% increase). Under the same GR projection, the overall numbers of LW is simulated to increase by 18% (from 7331 to 8666). The uncertainty range in the hydrologic response of the system caused by differences among GR projections (Wet and Dry) are also evaluated.

ID CLIMATE; HAZARD
AB Damage caused by floods has generally increased in Europe over the decades, and reducing the flood risk has become a recognised priority throughout the continent. Floods constitute a burden on the economies of European countries and insurance companies, not only because of the damage they cause but also because of the costs of structural flood defences and safety measures in general. The main reasons for the increasing flood risk are: presence of settlements and the growing value of assets in flood-prone areas; climate and environmental (land use and land cover) changes that always happen but have recently been accelerated because of radically different demographic conditions and technological progress. Statistical analyses by Munich Re's NatCatSERVICE database underline the high relevance of floods to European societies. The reasons for the rising trends in flood losses are explained. The flood risk is borne by various stakeholders - individuals, businesses, governments and the insurance sector. This paper discusses the taxonomy of floods, presents flood statistics for Europe and examines the reasons for flood risk increase. It also examines flood risk reduction, focusing on various aspects of flood insurance as a means of risk transfer.

AB The knowledge of the rainfall drop size distribution (DSD) at the land surface is essential for understanding precipitation mechanisms affecting soil erosion processes. Rainfall erosivity is defined as the potential of rain to cause erosion and it can be evaluated by rainfall kinetic power, which is determined by DSD and raindrop terminal velocity.
   This paper firstly deals with the raindrop terminal velocity estimate. Then the most widely used DSD are reviewed highlighting the difference between the raindrop size distribution per unit volume of air and that per unit area and time. The reliability of the available kinetic power-rainfall intensity relationships and their application in several part of the world is discussed, highlighting that the use of rainfall intensity is not sufficient to determine the rainfall kinetic power everywhere. Finally, the influence of seasonality on both raindrop size distribution and rainfall energy characteristics is investigated using DSD measurements carried out by an optical disdrometer placed at Palermo experimental area.

AB In practice, the rational operation rule derived from historical information and real-time working condition can help the operators make the quasi-optimal scheduling plan of hydropower reservoirs, leading to significant improvements in the generation benefit. As an emerging artificial intelligence method, the extreme learning machine (ELM) provides a new effective tool to derivate the reservoir operation rule. However, it is difficult for the standard ELM method to avoid falling into local optima due to the random determination of both input-hidden weights and hidden bias. To enhance the ELM performance, this research develops a novel class-based evolutionary extreme learning machine (CEELM) to determine the appropriate operation rule of hydropower reservoir. In CEELM, the k-means clustering method is firstly adopted to divide all the influential factors into several disjointed sub-regions with simpler patterns; and then ELM optimized by particle swarm intelligence is applied to identify the complex input-output relationship in each cluster. The results from two reservoirs of China show that our method can obtain satisfying performance in deriving operation rules of hydropower reservoir. Thus, it can be concluded that the model's generalization capability can be improved by isolating each subclass composed of similar dataset.

AB Theories and models used in soil hydrological sciences rely on the knowledge of the spatially and temporally variable soil hydraulic properties, i.e. the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. Obtaining reliable experimental information on these curves for an area of interest is not easy and it still remains a challenge for soil scientists. In 2006, a simple and physically based methodology was proposed to completely characterize the soil using a single ring infiltration experiment in the field and determination of soil particle size distribution, initial and final soil water content and dry soil bulk density. This methodology, named BEST - Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters, has received great attention and interest from the worldwide scientific community and it shows promise for further developments. This review paper aims to take the reader into the BEST world. Initially, the BEST experiment is described and the different algorithms that can be applied to analyze the infiltration data are illustrated. Then, an overview of the use that has been made of BEST up to now in the world is provided. Subsequently, infiltration prediction by BEST equations is discussed from both a theoretical and a practical point of view, i.e. with reference to the shape and geometric parameters of the assumed infiltration model and to the effects of the available information for the transient and steady-state phases of the process. Then, the application of BEST is presented with reference to different types of heterogeneous soils. Finally, practical recommendations and theoretical and experimental perspectives are provided.

AB The groundwater storage of China's Alxa Plateau (AP), one of the driest plateaus in the World, with a mixed landscape of deserts, including the Gobi, natural riparian oases and mosaic groundwater-fed irrigation areas, is vulnerable to global climate change and enhanced human activities. In this study, we revealed the temporal and spatial pattern of the changes in groundwater storage (GWS) across the AP by integrating satellite observations, hydrological modelling and ground data during the period of 2003-2016. Our results showed the GWS experienced a significant decreasing trend across the AP, while the precipitation did not significantly change. GWS continues to decrease in the center of the AP, i.e., the Badain Jaran Desert, which is likely associated with the fact of increasing evapotranspiration. The anthropogenic influences were reflect as the long-term extraction of groundwater has strongly depleted the GWS in the southeastern AP; however, in the northwestern part of the AP, groundwater depletion has been relieved due to the water diversion project with general increasing river runoff. Furthermore, based on our analysis and a broad review of the studies in other sub-regions over the AP, the possible regional flow path was proposed with particular addressing on the likely influence by anthropogenic activities. The dynamics in the GWS among the different hydrogeological units is likely interconnected through regional groundwater flow paths. Decreasing of GWS in the central AP, which would lead to reducing groundwater discharge to the northwestern AP, might further cause the groundwater depletion in the northwestern AP. Our results emphasize the tempo-spatial patterns in GWS change and the associated hydrological and ecological processes across the dry plateau. Identifying and untangling the various processes that impact on groundwater storage would allow us to develop more effective water management strategies.

AB Understanding catchment sediment or solute transport frequently relies on understanding of soil nutrient conditions and physical properties. This study investigates hydropedological patterns in a tropical catchment by understanding soil nutrient and soil surface changes. Soil nutrient concentrations and hydraulic properties were measured from the La Vega micro watershed in the southwestern Colombian Andes at 16 distributed locations in four elevation ranges (between 1450 and 1700 m a.s.l.). The site is a part of a conservation partnerships which implements programs and monitor impacts. Soil samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), Bray II-available phosphorus, exchangeable cations, pH, organic matter, and texture. Soil hydraulic conductivities at two depths (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm) were determined in conservation implementation areas (enclosures and natural regrowth). In the upper elevation range, regrowth of natural vegetation was found on deep soils (similar to 3 m) with moderate infiltration (26 cm hr(-1)), the lowest bulk density (0.92 g cm(-3)), and the highest TN (0.4%). The lowest elevation (mixed land use of grazing and riparian forests with deep profiles) had the lowest infiltration (4 cm hr(-1)), highest bulk density (1.02 g cm(-3)), and the lowest TN (0.26%). In the middle elevation ranges, conserved tropical forest vegetation were located on shallow soil depths with high organic matter (similar to 6%) and high infiltration (86 cm hr(-1)). The lowest infiltration rate average (2.3 cm hr(-1)) exceeded the estimated erosive regional precipitation intensity (similar to 2.5 cm hr(-1)) about 60% of the time, while the median infiltration rate (10 cm hr(-1)) exceeded rainfall intensities 94% of the time, indicating that infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanisms are both present. Coupling data with sediment concentration and solute concentration patterns can help discern correlations between scales and will help to monitor effectiveness of conservation programs aimed at sustaining ecosystem services.

ID OPERATION; MODELS
AB Water planner and managers always work in a changing and uncertain environment, since the majority of water resource-related data is imprecise or uncertain to some extent. MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) is a well-suited decision support tool for water resources management, however multiple uncertainties existed in criteria weights (CWs) and performance values (PVs) hinder the application of MCDM methods in real-world problems. This paper proposes an application-oriented stochastic MCDM framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty. A weight aggregation approach based on the game theory coupled with feasible weight space (FWS) is developed for conflict resolution and uncertainty estimation. We propose a novel SMAA-GRA model by combining the stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) theory and grey relational analysis (GRA). The risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree are utilized to assess decision-making uncertainty. We perform significance analysis to examine the impacts of input parameter uncertainties on the final assessment of alternatives. The proposed framework is demonstrated via two water resources management case studies. Numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the robustness and computational efficiency of the framework as well as the effects of uncertainty level and probability distribution type on decision-making results. The results indicate that the framework enables water managers to examine the robustness of final decisions and allows a risk-informed water resource decision to be made with higher reliabilities.

AB This work adopts a multicriteria approach, combining diverse karst hydrogeology techniques, to investigate the functioning of evaporite-karst systems, which are normally less studied due to the poor quality of their water resources. The applicability of using several methods was also verified. In view of previous experience at a pilot site within southern Spain, the natural responses of the main discharge point of the system of study (Lower Anzur spring) were controlled by continuous monitoring of the discharge rate, water temperature, and electrical conductivity. Water samples were collected for chemical analysis and for the determination of intrinsic fluorescence, water stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2) and tritium (H-3) concentrations. Physico-chemical data were statistically examined applying principal component analysis (PCA) and trend analysis tests (Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope). The system shows a clear karstic functioning, highly dependent on concentrated recharge, and influenced by a limited drainage capacity of the conduit network. The piston-flow effects at the beginning of floods indicate a contribution to the drainage of deep ascending flows through the saturated zone. Subsequent drops in temperature and mineralization values in the water drained by the spring, as well as a recent infiltration deduced from the signature of intrinsic fluorescence and stable isotopes, point to a good hydrogeological connection from the recharge areas to the spring. Later restoration of the initial values of mineralization -in a much shorter time than those of temperature- reveals a faster geochemical evolution of the recently infiltrated groundwater, which may be a distinctive trait of evaporite karst aquifers. Lastly, the high solute content of the spring water in depletion conditions, with ascending trends of mineralization and temperature observed during several dry years as a consequence of lower recharge contribution, together with the tritium activity of selected samples, suggest the existence of an old component partly responsible for the spring base flow. Thus, groundwater would be linked to gravity-driven regional flows, but also to recent conduit flows. All the results obtained led us to devise a hydrogeological conceptual model to precisely reflect the functioning of the studied system. The results presented here demonstrate the advantages of using diverse techniques when investigating evaporite karst aquifers.

AB The relative permeability versus saturation relation is fundamental for modeling unsaturated flow processes in aperture-based fractures. On the basis of the local cubic law and the connectivity probability of aperture distribution within single fractures, an analytical relationship between the relative permeability and saturation is established. When the van Genuchten function on the description of the capillary pressure-saturation relationship is applied, an explicit mathematical expression between the relative permeability and saturation is gained similar to the form of the van Genuchten-Mualem (VG-M) model of porous media. Through the comparisons between the several series of laboratory-measured data available in the literature and theoretical results, good agreements are both presented and they suggest that the proposed VG-M model can be successfully used for aperture-based fractures as well as porous media. To understand aperture variation dependence of the relative permeability properties, a computational method combining fractal theory and the invasion percolation model to determine the empirical parameters associated with the spatial correlation of aperture distribution is developed. Simulated fractures with spatially correlated and uncorrelated aperture distributions corresponding respectively to small and large fractal dimensions are both studied. According to the simulated results, the residual saturation generally increases with fractal dimension increments. However, the value of m exhibits a weak dependence on fractal dimension. The proposed model can be applied to various engineering such as seepage control for rock slopes, petroleum reservoirs, nuclear waste disposal and geologic storage of carbon dioxide.

Then, integrated geochemical, remote sensing, and field studies were conducted to address the age, origin, hydrogeological setting, and evolution of the southern sections of the MAS (Rub Al Khali Aquifer System (RAKAS)), the area identified from the analysis of GRACE and ISMs as being the most suited for sustainable development. Analysis of GRACE and ISMs revealed: (1) the MAS central and northern sections are experiencing high groundwater extraction (6.6 km(3)/yr) and depletion rates (-2.8 +/- 0.8 km(3)/yr) with minimum balancing potential through aquifer capture processes, yet sustainability could be achieved by reducing annual extraction by 2.8 km(3), and (2) the MAS southern sections (Rub Al Khali Aquifer System (RAKAS)) are experiencing low groundwater depletion rates (eastern RAKAS: -1.8 +/- 1.4 mm/yr) to steady-state conditions (western RAKAS: -0.73 +/- 1.4 mm/yr). Geochemical, remote sensing, and field investigations over the RAKAS revealed: (1) the presence of west to east trending drainage networks and large-scale groundwater flow systems consistent with a meteoric source (precipitation over Red Sea Hills); (2) increasing Cl-36 model ages along groundwater flow directions (up to 970,000 years), indicating aquifer recharge in wet Pleistocene periods; (3) progressive depletion in the O and H stable isotopic compositions of aquifers with increasing distance from the Red Sea Hills basement outcrops, indicating modest recharge during prevailing dry conditions; and (4) the presence of relatively fresh (TDS: 800-2800 mg/L) and nonradioactive (Ra-226 + Ra-228 < 0.185 Bq/kg) water in western RAKAS. Findings suggest that sustainable agricultural development is achievable at current extraction rates in western RAKAS and provide a replicable and cost-effective model.

AB The magnitude and frequency of hydro-meteorological extremes are expected to increase in a changing environment in ways that threaten the security of US energy-water assets. These include probable maximum precipitation (PMP) and probable maximum flood (PMF), which are used as hydraulic design standards for highly sensitive infrastructures such as nuclear power plants and main dams. To assess the flood vulnerability due to PMP/PMF, an integrated high-resolution process-based hydro-meteorologic modeling framework was used to develop ensemble-based probabilistic flood maps based on best-available historic observations and future climate projections. A graphics processing unit-accelerated 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the surface inundation areas corresponding to a total of 120 PMF hydrographs. These ensemble-based PMF maps were compared with flood maps obtained from the conventional deterministic PMP/PMF approach, revealing added information about conditional probability of flooding. Further, a relative sensitivity test was conducted to explore the effects of various factors in the framework, such as meteorological forcings, antecedent hydrologic conditions, reservoir storage, and flood model input resolution and parameters. The proposed framework better illustrates the uncertainties associated with model inputs, parameterization, and hydro-meteorological factors, allowing more informed decision-making for future emergency preparation.

TI Transient scour and fill. The case of the Pilcomayo River
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Transient scour; Sediment transport; River morphology; Pilcomayo River
AB Transient scour and fill refers to the general scour and fill in a riverbed due to flood passage. It was given much attention in times of Leopold and Maddock (1953) and Colby (1964) from records of outstanding case studies. Field data from a station in a contracted, long reach of the large sand-bed Pilcomayo River -1192 newly typed in forms- are presented, with sediment concentration in the database up to 60 kg/m(3), mostly wash load. Water surface rises and falls during a flood event, whereas streambed evolves in reverse (it renders the analogy to an accordion). Streambed scouring accounts for 36% of the change in flow area during floods and data reveal scouring up to 4 m from the streambed elevation when flood starts. Velocity data display large hysteresis loops inexplicable by unsteady flow only. Once streambed starts to fall, river bed scour is self-sustaining. Water depth gradient appears to be a crucial variable in a novel equation for transient scour and fill derived from Exner equation. It turns out that flow non-uniformity is relevant to explain transient scour and fill in contrast to flow unsteadiness, which is not. Quasi-steady gradually varied flow equation solved along the contracted reach is the base for a model that captures well the recorded bed evolution. The model explains most of the transient scour and fill by the downstream expansion, but the non-uniform flow and the bed material suspended load also play a role. The model fails on the days of highest sediment concentrations.

AB Seawater intrusion modelling is often used to assist with groundwater management in coastal areas and islands. Although Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) schemes are able to simulate multi-fluid flows in porous media, they have not been widely tested against experimental observations yet. Additionally, numerical methods for groundwater flow problems need to be able to simulate pumping, which is an unexplored area in SPH. In this study, an Explicit Incompressible SPH (EISPH) solver for multi-fluid flow in porous media is used to simulate the dynamics of freshwater lenses in small islands, and is further developed to simulate groundwater pumping and associated seawater upconing. Three methods to implement a sink term that models water pumping from an aquifer are proposed and compared. The model is successfully tested against data from published laboratory-scale experiments and other numerical models. The results of EISPH are comparable to other models. The inclusion of a sink for water particles to simulate pumping did not affect the stability of the simulations, although one of the three methods led to results that better compared to experimental data. Hence, SPH modelling of groundwater flows in porous media can be successfully achieved using the methods developed here.

AB To investigate the seasonal variation of chemical weathering and its controlling factors in the central Tibetan Plateau (TP), hydrochemistry of stream water in two alpine catchments, the Niyaqu and Qugaqie, was studied at an unprecedented temporal resolution from July 2016 to September 2017. Chemical compositions of river water in the two catchments were dominated by Ca2+ and HCO3-center dot SO42- in the stream water mainly derived from sulfide oxidation but sulfuric acid played a minor role in rock weathering compared with carbonic acid. The contributions of atmospheric input, silicate weathering, carbonate weathering and sulfide oxidation to riverine solutes of the Niyaqu, which overlies tuff, sandstone, shale, and carbonate and is mainly recharged by groundwater, were about 5%, 12%, 65%, and 18%, respectively; these contributions to dissolved loads of the Qugaqie, where lithology consists of granite and sandstone and nearly half the stream water originates from glaciers meltwater, were 10%, 35%, 34% and, 20%, respectively. Contribution of different sources to riverine solutes in the Niyaqu were almost invariant between different seasons, while the percentage of these sources in the stream water of the Qugaqie showed significant seasonal variations, especially for the weathering of silicate and carbonate: average value of the former increased from 29% in the monsoon season to 45% during the nonmonsoon period, on the contrary, average value of the latter decreased from 37% to 29% in the corresponding periods. Carbonate weathering rates (CWR) and silicate weathering rates (SWR) in the study areas exhibited distinct seasonal variability. During the monsoon season, the average CWR and SWR values in the Niyaqu were 34.3 t/km(2)/y and 6.8 t/km(2)/y, respectively, and their corresponding values in the Qugaqie were 16.7 t/km(2)/y and 11.0 t/km(2)/y, respectively, which means that the average value of CWR in the Niyaqu during the monsoon season is comparable with the CWR (average for one year) in catchments located in the eastern TP, and the SWR in the Qugaqie during the monsoon season is close to the SWR (average for one year) of some basins at the south slope of the Himalaya. Chemical denudation rates decreased sharply during the nonmonsoon period, indicating little chemical exhumation within that time due to cold and arid weather. Runoff was the most important factor that controls chemical weathering in both the Niyaqu and Qugaqie, followed by physical erosion rates, and the influence of temperature seems to be insignificant in the Niyaqu while at the same time crucial in the Qugaqie.

AB Parametric Budyko method has been widely used to assess water availability under changing environment. Its single parameter (w) controlling the shape of the Budyko curve, is of critical importance to water availability assessment (WAA). Here, the water availability is defined as the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation in the context of Budyko hypothesis. As an unobserved variable, w is generally estimated through incorporating the long-term water-balance model and Budyko hypothesis, i.e. estimating w as a function of precipitation, runoff, and potential evapotranspiration over a long-term time series of these variables. Inevitably, the estimated value of w is subject to uncertainty resulting from hydro-meteorological records with limited size. Further, this uncertainty affects WAA in context of Budyko hypothesis. The uncertainty and its propagation issue is often overlooked in past research. In this paper, we develop a bootstrap-based algorithm to reveal aforementioned uncertainty. Moreover, a partial derivative-based sensitivity analysis is performed for understanding the propagation of w uncertainty on WAA. Three catchments located in the Yellow River Basin, China, are used as case study sites. Results indicate that there exists remarkable uncertainty in parameter w, which varies with the data length. The impact of such uncertainty on WAA increases quickly under the humid condition, thereafter reaches a peak under the mild condition, and decreases slowly under the arid condition. The reason behind this phenomenon is the largest sensitivity of WAA to parameter w under the mild climate condition. Moreover, a general analytical expression for determining the critical value of climate condition which maximizes the impact of parameter w uncertainty on WAA is derived in this paper. Results of this study can enhance the reliability and robustness of Budyko-based models.

AB Adjustment of weather radar estimates using observed precipitation has been an accepted procedure for decades. Ground observations of precipitation typically come from rain gauges, but can also include data from diverse networks of sensors, with different levels of reliability. This study presents a standardized framework for evaluating adjustment algorithms using synthetically constructed, but realistic, rain grids and weather radar rainfall. Ground observation points are randomly placed throughout the synthetic storm domain and the precipitation for each sensor is extracted from the true rain. Then a subset of the sensors are defined as unreliable, and a log-normal error factor is applied at those locations.
   This double network of rain sensors could be applicable, for example, when rainfall is derived from signal attenuation between commercial microwave link (CML) antennas. Past research has tested CML observations as a source of precipitation data and validated various radar adjustment algorithms. However, a comprehensive evaluation of adjustment algorithms using accurate gauge data mixed with CML observations at different densities is lacking.
   Five adjustment algorithms are applied to the synthetic radar grid: Mean Field Bias (MFB), a Multiplicative algorithm, Mixed (additive and multiplicative), Conditional Merge (CondMerge) and Kriging with External Drift (ICED). Generation of the synthetic framework, and application of the adjustment algorithms is repeated for 150 realizations. Comparison of coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error and linear regression for all adjustment procedures over all realizations indicates the following results. Only MFB and KED adjustments performed well when using accurate gauges. The kriging based KED was able to achieve good adjustment also with the addition of error-prone sensors. CondMerge and the Mixed and Multiplicative, however, resulted in poorer adjustments.

AB Unprecedented population growth combined with environmental and energy demands have led to water conflict in the Southeastern United States (SEUS). The states of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia have been engaged in litigation since 1990 on minimum in-stream flows to maintain ecosystems, fisheries and energy demands while satisfying a growing thirst in metropolitan Atlanta. A study of twenty-six unimpaired SEUS (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee) streamflow stations identified a decreased pattern of flow over the past similar to 25 years with more frequent dry periods being observed in the last several decades. When evaluating calendar year streamflow, a period of high streamflow in the 1970's was followed by a consistent decrease in streamflow from the late 1980's to present. The identification of Atlantic Ocean (AO) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) teleconnections with SEUS streamflow may prove valuable in explaining decadal patterns of streamflow variability. Previous studies have identified the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) as being teleconnected with SEUS precipitation and streamflow. The current research applied the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) statistical method to AO Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) and SEUS streamflow. Annual streamflow volumes from the twenty-six unimpaired SEUS streamflow stations (1952-2016) were selected as the hydrologic response while average AO SSTs were calculated for three different six month averages (January to June or JFMAMJ, April to September or AMJJAS, and July to December or JASOND) for the year (1951-2015) preceding streamflow. The results confirmed an SST region in the North Atlantic as being teleconnected with SEUS streamflow and that an observed multi-decadal increase in temperatures in this SST region may be associated with the observed recent multi-decadal decline in SEUS streamflow.

AB The role of preferential flow through unsaturated saprock (fractured bedrock with weathering restricted to fracture margins) in hillslope hydrology remains inadequately described. To address this issue, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), controlled infiltration, and high-frequency subsurface moisture monitoring were integrated to characterize saprock preferential flow (SPF) in the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. In a planar hillslope with shallow fractured shale bedrock (starting at 0.1-0.3 m below ground), two pulses of water (79.5 L in total) were released followed by time-lapse GPR surveys. Differentiating GPR images collected before and after infiltration revealed lateral SPF in the direction of bedding plane fractures near the infiltration trench but with limited development of SPF down gradient along the hillslope. This was confirmed by soil and saprock moisture monitoring at a soil pit (0.2 m downslope of the GPR grid) where only one out of fifteen probes responded to the controlled infiltration. Lateral SPF frequently occurred at the GPR grid during a 24-day period with ten rainfall events, especially under the wet initial conditions. Additional infiltration experiments in a convex hillslope and a nearby bare slope with exposed saprock demonstrated the impact of fracture patterns on the routing of SPF. Three types of SPF in hillslope hydrology were identified, including (1) vertical percolation, (2) exfiltration from saprock to soil, and (3) stormwater transported downslope from planar and convex hillslopes to concave hillslopes. A 3D fill-and-spill model is proposed for the study site and similar areas that recognizes the importance of subsurface flow networks, with shallow saprock and concave hillslopes as essential controls of hillslope subsurface flow.

AB The description of the floods which have occurred in the past and an assessment of the adverse impacts they have entailed are among the duties required by the European Flood Directive. Indeed, to understand the consequences of a future flood on a city that in the past has already been affected by other flood events, it is very useful to reconstruct the hydraulic effects produced by those events. Such a task is particularly difficult for cases which occurred many years ago. For past events, it is often easier to have conventional hydrological data (for example, the hyetographs of the event) than conventional hydraulic data (recordings of flow rates, water depths, etc.). It is also difficult to obtain the topography valid for the period in which the event occurred. The greater the distance in time the greater the difficulty in gathering these data.
   In this paper we present a criterion for making a flow of information, using various non-conventional sources of information (such as amateur videos, photographs, traditional topographic surveys, news reports, etc.). In particular, it is shown how the data thus obtained can be used together in order to reconstruct numerically the hydraulic dynamics of a flood event in an urban area with a complete hydrodynamic model, which requires a particularly accurate computational domain.
   All these issues will be presented and discussed with reference to the numerical reconstruction of the flood event that occurred 23 years ago (1996) in the city of Crotone (Calabria, Italy).

AB Soil water storage and movement are highly heterogeneous across landscapes and their response to spatio-temporal variations in meteorological forcing is complex. While different pools of soil water (including bound and mobile water) are observed, the mechanisms of soil water movement in semi-arid and sub-humid regions are not well understood due to high variation in soil water storage conditions. The Taihang Mountain is a headwater region that recharges both groundwater and surface water systems of the North China Plain, where groundwater levels have been declining and water storage loss is serious. Increasing land cultivation in the Taihang Mountain areas has increased evapotranspiration and reduced both surface runoff and groundwater recharge. Although extreme precipitation is critical for groundwater recharge in the headwater regions, the response mechanism of soil water movement and groundwater recharge remains unclear. In this study, soil water movement and groundwater recharge mechanisms in a cultivated farmland (FL) and land under natural vegetation (NV) were determined for a normal and an extreme precipitation year through the combined use of soil water content and stable isotopes of water (O-18 and H-2). Soil water got enriched in delta O-18 and delta H-2 (delta O-18 changed from -11.2 to -7.0 parts per thousand at NV and from -11.1 to -4.4 parts per thousand at FL; delta H-2 changed from -71 to -49 parts per thousand at NV and from -73 to - 30% at FL) with increasing soil depth during the growing season suggesting that winter precipitation was generally transported via advection dispersion flow mechanism. However, this process was accompanied by the mixing of previously enriched soil water after large rain events (20-50 mm/day) during the rainy season in a normal precipitation year. Water movement changed from translatory flow to preferential flow after extreme precipitation in a wet precipitation year. Cultivation intensified water evaporation in the top soil layer (upper 10-20 cm), and induced preferential flow down to 50 cm soil depth under FL relative to land under NV. Thus, cropping significantly reduced groundwater recharge. Excessive storm during a wet year produced bypass flow after the first rainstorm, which rapidly recharged deep soil layers (50-100 cm depth). Bypass flow induced by excessive precipitation and contributed the most to groundwater in FL. The observed rapid response of soil water and groundwater to extreme precipitation events is critical for soil and water management to mitigate problems such as nitrate leaching and groundwater contamination in headwater regions of semi-arid and sub-humid areas.

AB Urban flooding is still frequently treated as a direct consequence of excess rainfall, without considering the watershed as an interdependent system connected with the development of its territory. The traditional flood control approach implies in continuous corrective interventions, usually of local character, and resulting from post-events responses. This process requires increasingly large investments to implement (or retrofit) structures capable to accommodate the runoff generated by new urbanized areas. These efforts have not prevented floods from continuing to cause high damages worldwide. Thus, there is a need to change stormwater management strategies, shifting to a risk management approach, not only considering cost-benefit analysis, but also internalizing the residual risk accounting for inherent uncertainties, such as climate change and fast and uncontrolled urban growth. This paper proposes a multi-criteria index, the Urban Flood Resilience index-UFRI, to measure quantitatively urban resilience to floods, supported by a hydrodynamic mathematical model and socio-economic indicators, resulting in spatialized maps as a communicating tool. A case study of an urban watershed in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil is used to demonstrate UFRI potential.

AB In regional hydrogeological models groundwater-surface water interaction is generally represented with a Cauchy boundary condition, in which a conductance parameter governs the exchange flux rate. In some models, the conductance is controlled by the streambed properties, since it has generally a lower hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer. However, depending on the specific system and the spatial discretization of the hydrogeological model, aquifer conductance can be a limiting factor for groundwater-surface water interactions. The present study introduces a new expression to represent the aquifer conductance as a function of aquifer properties, surface water network density and model discretization. This expression is based on the Dupuit-Forcheimer theory, the Ernst equation and vertical 2D numerical experiments at the field scale. The main assumptions used to derive our formulation are the presence of a no-flow boundary at the bottom of the hydrogeological model and the homogeneity of the aquifer. The expression is evaluated using simulations with 3D hydrogeological models at different spatial resolutions and compared against previously published parameterization approaches. The results show that the new expression outperforms the other approaches by capturing accurately both the grid-size and the surface water network density dependency of the conductance, which is caused by pressure head losses due to flow within the aquifer grid cell to the surface water, without any additional numerical calculation. Moreover, the proposed expression can be implemented directly in hydrogeological models thereby improving current approaches to represent groundwater-surface water interactions in regional hydrogeological models.

AB Subsurface dams are widely used to prevent saltwater intrusion around the world. A subsurface dam blocks the groundwater movement both from and towards the sea. This blockage often leads to an accumulation of pollutants and salt on the inland and sea-side of the dam, respectively. While the latter is intended, the former effect is not desired and poses a huge problem in groundwater management. Herein, we propose the use of dams of minimum effective height to prevent saltwater intrusion, and the use of the fresh groundwater discharge to assess the environmental performance of the subsurface dam. Laboratory tests and numerical simulations were used to study the effects of dam height, distance from the saltwater boundary, and head difference on the subsurface dam's saltwater intrusion prevention efficiency and fresh groundwater discharge. We found that i) the fresh groundwater discharge reaches its peak at the minimum dam effective height, and ii) the minimum effective dam height is shorter than the height of SWI without the dam. This means, under the premise of effectively preventing SWI, we can reduce both construction costs and increase fresh groundwater discharge through constructing the dam with the minimum effective dam height. When the dam height was less than the minimum effective dam height, the subsurface dam had little effect in preventing saltwater intrusion. As the dam distance to the shoreline increased, the minimum effective dam height and the peak fresh groundwater discharge decreased simultaneously. A reduction of the dam height is conducive to saving engineering cost, while a reduction of the peak fresh groundwater discharge favors the accumulation of land-based pollutants and salt. Although an increased distance of the dam to the coast seems more economic during construction, this also implies a larger inland soil salinization and accumulation of pollutants. The site selection of subsurface dams is therefore an optimization task that should consider both the engineering cost and ecological environmental effects.

AB The simulation and optimization of low impact development (LID) practices has been a key research topic in stormwater management. In this study, a fast and robust framework was proposed for providing the optimal design of LID practices by coupling a physically based model, the Markov chain, with the multi-objective shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MOSFLA). The proposed framework was then tested for chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction in a typical urban catchment in China. The storm water management model (SVVMM) was used to provide the flow/COD data during the baseline scenario, and the Markov chain method was then incorporated as a subset of the physically based model. Based on the results, the computational efficiency was improved by 500 times when the new framework was used, and the robustness of the optimal results increased over 50% compared to commonly used algorithms. The relative error between the SWMM and the Markov chain method was less than 5%, indicating that a satisfactory performance could be obtained using the proposed framework. This new method provides a useful tool for optimizing LID practices and green infrastructure, especially for complex urban catchments.

AB Offshore fresh groundwater is increasingly suggested as a potential water resource for onshore human demands. In many cases, onshore pumping already draws significant fresh groundwater from offshore. However, offshore aquifers and the extent of offshore freshwater are usually poorly characterised due to data scarcity. This study combines geophysical data, hydraulic information and a first-order mathematical analysis to investigate offshore freshwater extent in the Gambier Embayment (Australia). A large seismic data set, combined with onshore and offshore bore-log geological profiles, are used to explore the regional offshore hydro-stratigraphy. Aquifer hydraulic parameters and onshore heads are obtained from onshore investigations. A novel application of Archie's law, geophysical data and onshore hydrochemical data provide useful insights into the salinity profiles within four offshore wells. These are compared to steady-state, sharp-interface estimates of the freshwater extent obtained from a recently developed analytical solution, albeit using simplified conceptual models. Salinities derived from resistivity measurements indicate that in the south of the study area, pore water with total dissolved solids (TDS) of 2.2 g L-1 is found up to 13.2 km offshore. Offshore pore-water salinities are more saline in the northern areas, most likely due to thinning of the offshore confining unit. The analytical solution produced freshwater-saltwater interface locations that were approximately consistent with the freshwater-saltwater stratification in two of the offshore wells, although analytical uncertainty is high. This investigation provides a leading example of offshore freshwater evaluation applying multiple techniques, demonstrating both the benefit and uncertainty of geophysical interpretation and analytical solutions of freshwater extent.

AB Contaminant transport in the wetland flow is subject to various reactions. Most researches on this topic have limited to the single component contaminant, relatively little has concerned the effect of competitive reaction on the transport of coupled bicomponent contaminant. This work analytically studies the bicomponent contaminant transport in the free surface wetland flow under the combined conditions of reversible competitive transfer, irreversible degradation and bed absorption, by solving the constant-coefficient second-order linear system of parabolic type and the method of concentration moments. Up to the fourth order concentration moment in the previous work (Wang and Chen, 2017a) is applied to support the fourth order expansion of Hermite polynomials to rigorously derive the solutions with high accuracy. The results demonstrate that the masses of binary components decay at different rate, and the vertical concentration distributions of binary components are tremendously non-uniform in the asymptotic dispersion stage. Three types of reactions in addition to the hydraulic dispersion exert separate control on the concentration distributions. It suggests that the peak concentration rather than the mean should be based for strict environmental implements.

AB For a period of 16 months in Sydney, Australia, the variations of H-2/H-1 and O-18/O-16 in atmospheric vapour (delta H-2(A) and delta O-18(A)) were estimated using an evaporation pan method as well as using the isotopic precipitation-equilibrium approach. These calculations were then compared with delta H-2(A) values measured at 10 m above ground surface using a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). As pan isotopic composition was available on a weekly time scale, the evaporation rates were measured daily, and the atmospheric variables were available hourly, the weekly time scale was used to calculate the arithmetic averages of the atmospheric variables that were used in the estimation of the pan-derived delta H-2(A).
   Good agreement (r = 0.7, P-value = 0.00) was found between the pan-derived and the FTIR measured delta H-2(A) for weekly intervals, although individual differences ranged from similar to 25.0 to 20.4 parts per thousand, with the absolute difference averaging 8.0 parts per thousand. A sensitivity analysis showed that the determination of delta H-2(A) is most sensitive to air temperature, relative humidity and the isotopic composition of the pan water.
   While the precipitation-equilibrium approach only appears to be representative of atmospheric conditions close to times of precipitation events, the pan-derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour was found to be closer to the FTIR averages over longer periods including intervals with no precipitation. Overall, this means that the pan method is far more effective for uninterrupted estimation of delta H-2(A) and delta O-18(A) of atmospheric water vapour, as required for water budget studies, than the precipitation-equilibrium method, and it is more cost effective and robust than continuous measurement.

AB This paper proposes an analytical model for predicting the longitudinal profile of depth-averaged streamwise velocities in a channel with an emergent array of rigid cylinders. The governing equation of the analytical model was derived from the momentum equation and flow continuity equation. The longitudinal transect through a flume with a vegetation patch was divided into four regions based on two length scales of flow adjustment upstream of and inside the array, and analytical solutions were proposed for the four regions. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the array length does not influence flow adjustments near the upstream edge of the array, so the model can predict the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocity for either short or long arrays. Twenty groups of velocity data from different sources were used to verify the proposed model. The predicted velocities agreed well with the measured velocities, indicating that the model is capable of predicting the longitudinal profiles of the velocity upstream of and inside a model patch. The predicted velocity profile can be further employed to estimate regions of enhanced or diminished deposition of fine sediment or organic matter inside model patches.

AB Green roofs are emerging as practical strategies to retain stormwater runoff and improve water environment quality of urban cities. However, the impacts of green roofs on stormwater runoff quality remains a topic of concern to urban planners and mangers. In this study, we designed the scale based runoff plots of extensive green roofs with different substrate and vegetation types, and investigate whether the studied green roofs act as a sink or source of nutrients and suspended solids in their runoff compared to a conventional roof. The influences of substrate and vegetation on the water quality of green roof outflows were also assessed. The results showed that the average TSS (total suspended solids), TN (total nitrogen), and TP (total phosphorus) concentrations of the green roof runoff were all significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff. Except substrate S3 (the composition ratio of rural soil:peat soil:perlite:vermiculite was 2.5:5:2:0.5) and S1 (the composition ratio of rural soil: peat soil was 1:1) in TP, the substrate S2 (the composition ratio of rural soil:peat soil:pine needle:perlite was 1:1:1:1) displayed significantly higher TN and TP concentrations than either of the runoff from the substrate S1 and S3. The TN and TP concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 15 cm substrate depth treatments. Significant differences were observed in TN concentrations between vegetation Sedum Spectabile and Radix Ophiopogonis. However, no significant differences were observed between any of the vegetation types with regard to TP concentrations. Therefore, we suggest that green roofs need to be constructed of suitable substrate materials and plants based on their function on runoff water quality in order to mitigate the pollution risk of green roof runoff on urban water environment.

Effectively assessing waterlogging susceptibility can reduce or even avoid the damage caused by such disasters. Here, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen for waterlogging susceptibility assessment due to its simplicity, objectivity, and understandability. The Particle Swarm Optimization method was used to compute parameters of the SVM. When selecting negative samples for machine learning methods, the methods of subjective selection and single random selection used in previous studies made it easy to select improper negative samples, and thus affected the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the trained classifiers. To overcome these shortcomings, we proposed a repeatedly random sampling and verifying model to select negative samples for an SVM. As such, this study adopted the spatial framework of integrating GIS and an SVM to assess waterlogging susceptibility using the primary urban area of Guangzhou as an example. The results demonstrate that the waterlogging susceptibility map derived from the most accurate classifier (MAC) can reflect the real occurrence and spatial distribution of waterlogging. Moreover, we randomly generated 100,000 groups of samples to test the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the MAC; the results show that in 82% of the samples, the area under the curve value of the MAC was higher than that of the randomly generated classifier. This demonstrated that the sampling and verifying model can allow the selection of an MAC with a relatively high and stable classification accuracy. The proposed sampling method can overcome the shortcomings of negative sample selection method employed in previous studies, which makes the machine learning results more accurate and reliable. Furthermore, the method requires less data, which can be helpful in developing countries where the availability of long-term intensive hydrologic monitoring data is limited.

AB The waters of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers have always been a vital resource in the water-food-energy nexus of the Middle East region. The currently ongoing Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey aims to increase regional prosperity by optimizing the use of these waters for irrigation and hydropower. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the irrigation schemes and water management infrastructures within the scope of the GAP have caused significant land use and land cover (LULC) change in this semi-arid region. We employed a high resolution regional climate model to simulate the effects of irrigation induced LULC changes on the regional water and energy balances. For this purpose, historical simulations were conducted by using three land cover distributions which reflect the increase in irrigation and water surfaces. Our experiment reveals that water loss through evapotranspiration increases significantly with the areal expansion of irrigation. This increase is driven by the change in partitioning of the available energy at the surface between turbulent heat fluxes. On the one hand, a significant reduction in sensible heat flux causes local cooling by around 0.4 degrees C and 0.8 degrees C for the current and future irrigation conditions, respectively. On the other hand, the increase in latent heat flux enhances evapotranspiration and consequently atmospheric water vapor concentration. The moistening of a shallower boundary layer triggers the formation of convective clouds, which increases convective precipitation, most notably during the irrigation months. The enhanced water loss through evapotranspiration has potential to significantly alter the water budget of the GAP region. It seems that the water surplus of the headwaters region may not be enough to meet the water deficit of the GAP region in the future if the planned irrigation schemes are carried out to completion.

AB Growing inorganic and expansive hydrochemical datasets and large differences in the measured concentrations require methods that are capable of compressing data without the loss of critical information and subsequently displaying it in a condensed and comprehensive way. Here we train an artificial neural network, Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM), to model inorganic hydrochemical clusters and associate the salinity source with the distribution of the ionic concentration spatial variation at a former potash mining site. Kohonen's self-organizing maps are applied to project the data onto a two-dimensional grid and the geometric relationship of the projected vectors is subsequently used to perform a hierarchical cluster analysis. The SOM clustering approach succeeded in assigning the groundwater samples automatically according to their inorganic chemical composition. Five different clusters, three geogenic and two anthropogenic, were identified. The final outcome is displayed and compared with the classification from Piper plotting of the same dataset. In order to see the SOM clustering results in the large scale hydrogeological context, the distribution of the clusters is displayed spatially. This approach is a tool for the hydrogeologist to quickly analyze large datasets and present them in a clear and concise format.

ID HOT FLUID MIGRATION; SHOCK-WAVES; DEFORMATION; DIFFUSION
AB The dynamics of transients of fluid-rock temperature, pore pressure, pollutants in porous rocks are of vivid interest for fundamental problems in hydrological, volcanic, hydrocarbon systems, deep oil drilling. This can concern rapid landslides or the fault weakening during coseismic slips and also a new field of research about stability of classical buildings. Here we analyze the transient evolution of temperature and pressure in a thin boundary layer between two adjacent homogeneous media for various types of rocks. In previous models, this boundary was often assumed to be a sharp mathematical plane. Here we consider a non-sharp, physical boundary between two adjacent rocks, where also local steady pore pressure and/or temperature fields are present. To obtain a more reliable model we also investigate the role of nonlinear effects as convection and fluid-rock "frictions", often disregarded in early models: these nonlinear effects in some cases can give remarkable quick and sharp transients. All of this implies a novel model, whose solutions describe large, sharp and quick fronts. We also rapidly describe transients moving through a particularly irregular boundary layer.

AB The saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is considered to be one of the main soil hydraulic properties to simulate water transport in the vadose zone, yet it is notoriously difficult to assess due to its large field-scale variability and sensitivity to preferential flow paths. With the increasing availability of convenient methods to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-u), the additional value of measuring K-s could be questioned. This study investigates the relevance of measuring K-s in two ways. Firstly, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate which part of the hydraulic conductivity curve impacts the simulation of unsaturated water transport most. It was found that hydraulic conductivity curve between -10 cm and -1000 cm matric head was affecting the simulation more than at saturation. Secondly, a functional evaluation was performed by simulating water flow in six test fields according to three scenarios, in which the hydraulic properties were determined with the measured K-s and/or K-u. The simulation of saturation degree at three depths was the least accurate in the scenario where only K-s was measured. Remarkably, the most accurate simulation was found in the scenario with only the measured K-u. According to these results, measuring K-u would be of greater importance than measuring K-s for the simulation of water flow in the vadose zone.

AB Losing eight meters of water level over a 20-year period from 1996 to 2016 marked the Lake Urmia (LU) as one of the regional environmental crises. This condition has threatened biota life, intensified desertification around the lake, and raised social concerns by adversely impacting the inhabitants' health and economy. In 2013, the Urmia Lake Restoration National Committee (ULRNC) started implementing certain management practices to stop the drying trend of LU, resulted in the cease of water level drop and stabilization of LU condition in 2016. Nevertheless, the restoration actions have not yet raised the lake to the water level as planned by the roadmap. This paper aims to describe and to assess the LU restoration plans by underscoring the ULRNC achievements, challenges, and shortcomings. In particular, we discuss how the value of data and data-aided modeling has been underestimated by the LU restoration programs, leading to still existing puzzles about the lake interaction with the involving physical processes governing its dynamics. We show how the LU restoration timetable has not fulfilled the planned milestones as evidenced by the inability to capture the anticipated lake water levels, which is partly attributed to the lack of field data and dynamic modeling that could predict the lake response in a more reliable and conservative manner. The current restoration plans should also be revisited to ensure that any practice with the aim of reducing water consumption in the basin is not only environmentally sustainable but also feasible from the socioeconomic perspective. The insights provided by this paper attempt to underscore the value of field data collection for establishing a reliable conceptual model, and for executing pre- and post-monitoring of the lake so that the success or failure of the restoration actions taken by the policymakers can be appropriately evaluated.

AB High urbanization puts many groundwater resources at risk of quality deterioration. Analyzing all viable potential groundwater contamination scenarios for good decision making requires reliable tool. Coupling several complex models in integrated modelling can often fail to perform in reasonable time. Possible solution in that case could be usage of simplified models in order to speed up long-term continuous calculations and simulations. The paper presents the application of the Cellular Automata (CA) approach in modelling of the contaminant transport under unsteady groundwater conditions. It compares the results obtained using coupled CA models with well-known analytical solutions and standard methods used for pollution transport modelling in groundwater conditions, such as coupled MODFLOW and MT3DMS. Results obtained in this paper show that CA approach can be satisfactorily used for simulations of unsteady groundwater conditions, caused by surface-groundwater interaction, and pollution transport, especially in diffusion dominant cases, gaining the reduction of simulation time up to 10 times.

AB Where surface and groundwater are managed conjunctively, the stress on water supplies from climate change can significantly influence water use patterns as well as the economic value and sustainability of those uses. However, aquifer protection can be an expensive proposition because water uses that currently rely on aquifer pumping may produce considerable economic value that would be lost if protection measures are carried out. Evidence from climate-stressed regions has attracted research addressing the costs and benefits of aquifer protection plans. Despite these efforts, few peer-reviewed papers have examined water use patterns that minimize the economic costs of aquifer protection. This work presents an original approach to address that gap by developing and applying a basin scale hydroeconomic optimization model of North America's Middle Rio Grande Basin to explore impacts of new policies not yet implemented supporting aquifer protection. It also gives model access to readers or stakeholders to experiment with their own scenarios to assess impacts of alternative aquifer protection plans. The model accounts for surface and groundwater storage, irrigation, urban, environmental, and recreational demands, surface water inflows under various climate scenarios, groundwater pumping and recharge, substitute water prices, crop water use, evaporation, as well as institutional constraints governing water use. The objective is implemented by finding the optimized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over uses, sectors, and regions from use of surface water and connected aquifers. Results are shown for each of six water supply scenarios, two substitute water prices, and two system operation rules. To address impacts of aquifer protection targets, groundwater sustainability targets are specified and enforced as constraints for each of the region's two major aquifers. We assess total and marginal cost of achieving two targeted aquifer protection levels by identifying optimized surface use and groundwater pumping for each of 24 scenarios. Results show that climate change, in the form of reduced and highly variable inflows, considerably drives up the cost of protecting aquifer sustainability, amplified by the conjunctive nature of the system. Future work points to a need to assess economic performance of various water conservation measures as well as reducing costs of substitute water through measures such as technical advance in desalination, recycling and reuse, substitution of other resources for water, better characterization of existing aquifers, and development of new groundwater supplies.

AB Groundwater resources are increasingly exploited for industrial and agricultural purposes in many arid/semiarid regions globally. In order to gain a harmonious development among groundwater resources and economic benefits, urgent investigation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the groundwater chemistry is required. Understanding hydrochemical mechanism of groundwater in Yinchuan Plain, arid and semi-arid area in Northwestern China, plays a significant role in water resources planning in this ecologically sensitive area. In this paper, a total of 460 phreatic water samples were collected, including 58 water samples containing isotopic data (D and H-2). Results demonstrate that water chemistry type and isotopic data of phreatic water presents a zonation characteristic from west to east and from south to north. In the eastern part of the Helan Mountain (A(1) zone), the type of hydrochemistry is mainly HCO3 center dot SO4-CaMg, SO4 center dot HCO3-Ca center dot Mg, which is mainly recharged by the bedrock fissure water of Helan Mountain. However, in the southern Qingtongxia (A(2) zone) are HCO3-Na HCO3-Ca center dot Mg, which receives irrigation and spring water recharge. Phreatic aquifer in Multi-layered structure zone (A(3) zone) reflect multiple recharge sources to the aquifer, the water chemistry demonstrates diverse variations. The anion was dominated by the HCO3, while the cation is dominated by sodium. The predominant controlling factors of phreatic water hydrochemistry are divided into anthropogenic activities and natural conditions. Natural conditions mainly include the existence form and lithology of the aquifer, sources of groundwater recharge, soil salinity, and evaporation, mineral dissolution, ion exchange and adsorption and mixing effect. Meanwhile, among natural factors, minerals dissolution in groundwater is the main process dominating the hydrochemical evolution of the groundwater. The other is anthropogenic activities which can be classified as groundwater pollution, excessive exploitation or excretion of groundwater, and excessive groundwater recharge.

AB Accurate influent flow forecasting plays a significant role in management, operation, scheduling and utilization of the sewage treatment plants. In design and operate such plants, it is essential to measure and forecast the influent flow rate in wastewater plants. In this paper, the Very immediate-short-term to long-term influent flow rate are modeled and forecasted by a new developed hybrid model of ANFIS and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The objective of this study is the integration of GWO with ANFIS in forecasting multi-ahead influent flow rate. The forecast horizon of the model is from 5 min up to 10 days bases on Gamma Test (GT) feature selection of input combinations. As the parameters of ANFIS have effect on the forecasting accuracy, these parameters are adjusted and optimized by using Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Then the choice of appropriate input parameters at different prediction horizons from Very immediate-short-term (5-min ahead) to long-term (10 days ahead) was discussed for influent forecasting. The statistical indices of RMSE, NSE, MAE, RAE, R-2, d, CI and graphical evaluations such as scatter-plots with confidence bounds, error distributions, Taylor diagrams, box-plots and empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) were implemented for assessing the performance of all models in prediction horizons. Furthermore as another novelty in the present paper, recursive forecasting models based on previous forecasted values is used to improve the accuracy and applicability of ANFIS-GWO in recursive predictions. Our Results showed that: (1) the hybrid of ANFIS-GWO significantly improved the prediction accuracy. (2) ANFIS-GWO performs more efficiently than the ANFIS in almost all of the prediction horizons (ANFIS-GWO1: 5 min ahead; ANFIS-GWO11: 1-2 days ahead; ANFIS-GWO8: one week ahead). (3) The performance of models in influent flow forecasting is significantly influenced by the prediction horizon. The computational results confirmed that the ANFIS-GWO performs well in all of prediction horizons. Equally the true values and the trends are precisely forecasted by the ANFIS-GWO. Results of this novel study demonstrate that reliable estimates of influent flow rate from 5-min up to 10 days in advance can be achieved using the developed direct and recursive hybrid GWO models.

AB Catchment classification aids in the identification of homogeneous regions in which catchments have similar flood timing and corresponding climatic drivers. As a new classification scheme from complex network theory, the community detection method is introduced to classify 242 catchments in the United States based on flood seasonality. The robustness of this method is tested by calculating the Adjusted Rank Index between the classification results from different random subsets of the 242 catchments and different flood sampling methods. In addition, three network metrics (network density, centrality, and k-core nucleus) are used to further unravel the hydrological connections within each community of catchments. Catchments with similar flood seasonality cluster into six large communities, while catchments in sparsely gauged areas or with unique physiographic properties are isolated from large communities. High values of the Adjusted Rank Index show the robustness of the community detection method for catchment classification. The results indicate that the complex network is valid for use in classifying catchments based on flood seasonality. Moreover, for each community, the network metrics are potential descriptors of: (a) the degree of homogeneity, (b) the representativeness of any catchment, and (c) the spatial scale of synchronized floods. Therefore, the complex network is able to characterize the interconnections between catchments within the community.

AB This study proposes a novel socio-hydrological modeling framework for assessing the performance of complex water resources systems. It employs and integrates agent-based modeling (ABM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) into the socio-hydrological modeling framework to account for agents' behaviors. Due to farmers' major role in anthropogenic droughts, this paper mainly focuses on farmers' behavior. The TPB framework and the agents' behavioral rules in ABM are structured based on the data obtained from field questionnaires and interviews by the farmers in the Zarrineh River Basin as the main river feeding the Urmia Lake. The proposed modeling framework, including the TPB and ABM structures and rules, are validated by comparing the results of the proposed socio-hydrological simulation model with the actual data on the simulation period. To assess the ability of the proposed framework, root mean square error (RMSE) and the determination coefficient (DC) were computed. The results show the acceptable performance of the proposed model by RMSE = 0.18 and DC = 0.92. Analysis of the results indicates that financial conditions, farmland size, farmers' age, and farmers' education are among the major factors in farmers' decision-making process, respectively.

AB River discharges flood forecasting is a complex task with multiple sources of uncertainty. Bayesian methods can incorporate multiple types of uncertainties by inferring the probability density function of ensemble forecasts based on past events. However, such methods lead to forecasts with large uncertainty bands. In order to reduce the uncertainty in the forecasts, we focus solely on the prediction of the upper and lower range of the uncertainty bands. Therefore, we develop three forecast methods in which we search for the indexes of the upper and lower forecast members of an ensemble (termed best-pairs), which provide the highest predictive skill. The results show for four distinct hindcasts of historical events in a case study in Bavaria (Germany) that the new methods have a higher predictive skill of the observations than probabilistic methods, at least for the first 4 out of 12 h' forecasts. Moreover, the new methods are computational efficient because they considerably reduce the number of members of the ensembles required to produce a flood discharge forecast with high predictive skill.

AB Subsurface reservoirs are far more heterogeneous and complex than the simulation models in terms of scale, assumptions and description. In this work, we address the issue of prediction reliability while calibrating imperfect/low-fidelity reservoir models. The main goal is to avoid over-confident and inaccurate predictions by including a model for the bias terms (i.e. error-model of a predefined form) during the history matching process. Our aim is to obtain unbiased posterior distributions of the physical model parameters and thus improving the prediction capacity of the calibrated low-fidelity reservoir models. We formulate the parameter estimation problem as a joint estimation of the imperfect model parameters and the error-model parameters. The structure of the error-model and the prior distributions of the error-model parameters are evaluated before calibration through analysis of leading sources of the modeling errors. We adopt a Bayesian framework for solving the inverse problem, where we utilize the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA) as a practical history matching algorithm.
   We provide two test cases, where the impact of typical model errors originating from grid coarsening/upscaling and from utilizing an imperfect geological model description is investigated. For both cases results from the ES-MDA update with and without accounting for model error are compared in terms of estimated physical model parameters, quality of match to historical data and forecasting ability compared to held out data. The test results show that calibration of the imperfect physical model without accounting for model errors results in extreme values of the calibrated model parameters and a biased posterior distribution. With accounting for modeling errors the posterior distribution of the model parameters is less biased (i.e. nearly unbiased) and improved forecasting skills with higher prediction accuracy/reliability is observed. Moreover, the consistency between the different runs of the ES-MDA is improved by including the modeling error component. Although the examples in the paper consider the oil-water system with permeabilities being parameters of the physical model, the developed methodology is general and can be applied to typical ground water hydrology models.

AB Depression is a significant public health issue, made worse by the absence of response to antidepressant medications by many patients. Given the high degree of overlap between sleep and circadian complaints and depression, chronotherapies are a promising avenue for novel, effective, and fast-acting treatments for depression.
   A critical literature review was conducted of bright light therapy (BLT) as a treatment for unipolar depression. Additionally, a separate critical literature review was also conducted of several promising, non-pharmacological, combination chronotherapeutic treatments, including BLT, sleep deprivation/wake therapy, and sleep phase advance.
   Results of BLT as a treatment for depression are encouraging, especially when used as an adjunct to antidepressant medications. It may also be desirable in special populations, such as geriatric and perinatal patients. Overall, results from combination chronotherapies are encouraging, though none has strong empirical support. Combining chronotherapies is an avenue of treatment which should be further explored. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Sleep disturbances are one of the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), and more frequently in advancing stage, almost 67-78.6% of PD patients experience some form of sleep disturbance [1-3]. Our objective is to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of rotigotine (RTG) transdermal patch for the treatment of sleep disorder in PD.
   Methods: RevMan5.3 from the Cochrane Library was used to conduct a meta-analysis, primary outcome measure was score of sleep scale in Parkinson's Disease, the mean change in scores of each subscale was treated as a continuous variable and the weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated as the difference between the mean scale of sleep score in the treatment and control groups.
   Results: A total of five studies were included, and primary outcome measured by "PDSS" or "PDSS-2" score revealed a significant improvement in RTG treated patients compared to control [WMD: -6.66, 95% CI: (-8.54, -4.79), p < 0.0001], after the removal of two articles with high heterogeneity, the meta-analysis conclusion remained robust to methodological changes [WMD -3.90, 95% CI (-6.11, -1.69), p = 0.0005] and distinctly decreased heterogeneity was shown in the final result (I-2 = 7%).
   Conclusions: As for the safety of RTG, it is well tolerated and safe [WMD: 1.68, 95% CI: (1.33, 2.13), p < 0.0001], application site reaction and nausea are among the most frequent side effects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to explore the association between sleep problems and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Canadian adults with chronic diseases, and whether mental illness can mediate the association.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey, 2015. A total of 10,900 participants aged >= 18 years and diagnosed with chronic diseases were enrolled in this study.
   Results: Of these participants, 23.6% (95% CI 22.1, 25.2) suffered from severe impairment of HRQoL. Extreme sleep durations, including both short (<5, 5 to <6, and 6 to <7 h) and long (9 to <10, and >= 10 h) sleep durations, were significantly associated with severe impairment of HRQoL (compared to 7 to <8 h). Insomnia was also independently associated with severe impairment of HRQoL when compared to those without insomnia. In the mediation analyses, mental illness was shown to partly mediate the associations of extreme sleep durations and insomnia with severe impairment of HRQoL.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, both extreme sleep durations and insomnia were independently associated with severe impairment of HRQoL in adults with chronic diseases, and mental illness partly mediated the association. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NIGHTTIME SLEEP; RISK; PERFORMANCE; MORTALITY; NAP
AB Study objectives: The temporal relationship between nocturnal sleep and daytime napping has only been assessed in small non-representative samples, and suggests that nocturnal sleep and napping are interdependent, although mixed results exist. In this study, we investigated the temporal relationship between nocturnal sleep and napping (and vice versa).
   Methods: A population-based sample of middle-aged adults (N = 683, mean age 60.7 [SD 9.5]) completed seven days of ecological momentary assessment reporting sleep and nap characteristics. Multilevel random-effects models were used to assess the temporal relationship between sleep duration and quality, and nap occurrence and duration (and vice versa).
   Results: In sum, 64% of the study population took at least one nap over the course of seven days. Poor subjective sleep quality and shorter sleep duration increased the likelihood and duration of next-day napping. No effect of nap occurrence or duration was found on same-day nocturnal sleep duration and quality. However, when considering the timing of nap, afternoon naps, but not morning or evening naps, decreased same-day nocturnal sleep duration.
   Conclusion: Naps seem to compensate for poor subjective sleep quality, and to some extent for short sleep duration. As only afternoon naps reduced same-day nocturnal sleep duration, timing of the day-time nap seems to matter with respect to same-day nocturnal sleep duration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

DE Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); Prevalence; South Europe; STOP-Bang; Age;
   Sex
ID PREVALENCE; POPULATION; SCREEN; HEALTH
AB Introduction: Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disorder in the general population and increases over time all over the world. The high prevalence is in part due to increasing rates of obesity. However, estimates of OSA prevalence in Southern Europe are generally lacking.
   Aim: The aim of our study was to predict the risk of OSA in the general population of Cyprus, the southeast part of Europe, by using a dedicated questionnaire like STOP-Bang.
   Subjects and method: We screened 5736 sample housing units for eligible adults and a total population of 4118 eligible responders completed the STOP-Bang questionnaire. Participants were all adults, age 18 + residing in Cyprus. The sample was stratified according to the last demographic report (2016) by district, rural or urban area, gender and age and the estimated sample size needed was 2000. Our survey was conducted by Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing (CATI) method. The question about Neck Circumference was removed from the final evaluation due to the uncertainty of most of the participants and the risk of bias. Results: From a total of 4118 participants (2252 males - 54.7%, 1862 females - 45.3%), with 46.6% over 50 years old, 2641 (64.1%) were at low risk for OSA (0-2 positive answers), 1200 (29.1%) at intermediate risk (3-4 positive answers) and 277 (6.7%) at high risk (>= 5 positive answers). In sum, 29.9% responded positively for snoring, 39.3% for feeling tired or sleepy during the day, 12.3% for observed apnea during sleep, and 24.6% for having or being treated for hypertension. Class II and III obesity with Body Mass Index (BMI) > 35 kgr/m(2) was observed in 192 subjects (4.7%). In the subpopulation of obese participants (BMI>30 kg/m(2)), intermediate to high risk of OSA was present in 45%, whereas in obesity class II and III the percentage reached almost 90%.
   Conclusions: Our survey yielded that the prevalence of intermediate to high risk for OSA was 50% in males and 18% in females, in the general population of Cyprus. These findings were similar to previously reported high OSA prevalence worldwide, considering the fact that a single questionnaire is only a screening tool and cannot alone diagnose sleep apnea.

AB Objective: Sleep disturbances are frequently reported in Mowat-Wilson Syndrome (MWS). The current study aimed to evaluate clinical and video-polysomnographic (VPSG) characteristics of the sleep architecture and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns during sleep in MWS.
   Methods: Sixteen individuals with MWS (range 16 months-25 years), attending the Department of Child Neurology and Psychiatry of the University of Bologna, were included. The "Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children (SDSC)" questionnaire was administered to all parents of MWS patients, and all patients underwent a VPSG recording.
   Results: The analysis of the SDSC questionnaire revealed disturbances mainly at the sleep-wake transition and in initiating and maintaining sleep. Evaluation of sleep structure in MWS patients showed a significant reduction of total sleep time, an increase of wake after sleep onset and arousal index as compared to normal controls. An EEG pattern characterized by slowing of background activity and poverty of physiological sleep characterisitcs was observed in all patients. Moreover, in patients aged >7 years, anteriorly predominant spike and waves were observed, markedly activated by sleep configuring a sub-continuous or continuous activity.
   Conclusion: Our data (both clinical and VPSG) documented the presence of significant and clinically relevant sleep disturbances in MWS patients. Moreover, we identified a characteristic age-dependent sleep EEG pattern that could provide a new element to assist in the management of MWS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Salivary cortisol; Urinary cortisol; Insomnia; MSLT; Zolpidem
ID DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; SYSTEM; MSLT
AB Objectives: To determine whether cortisol levels, both diurnal and pre-sleep, would vary as a function of MSLT and would be reduced by nightly placebo versus zolpidem 10 mg.
   Methods: DSM-IVR diagnosed subjects with insomnia (N = 95), aged 32-70 yrs, having no other sleep disorder, unstable medical or psychiatric diseases or drug dependency served. On a screening MSLT 27 had MSLTs < 10 min (Lo) and 42 > 15 min (Hi). Participants took 10 mg zolpidem or placebo, double-blind, nightly for 12 months. In months one and 12 urine was collected over 24 h in 8 hr-aliquots and assayed for cortisol (Ward Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI). Saliva samples were collected 35 min before bedtime and the 30 min drug administration in month one and eight, and analyzed for cortisol levels (Salimetrics, State College, PA).
   Results: Pre-sleep salivary cortisol was higher in insomniacs than controls, but did not differ as a function of MSLT. Nightly zolpidem reduced pre-sleep cortisol relative to placebo on month one and eight, with no month effects or interaction. Diurnal (0700-1500 h) urinary cortisol was higher overall in the Hi vs Lo MSLT subjects with insomnia, was stable across months, and was not reduced with zolpidem.
   Conclusions: Hyperarousal among subjects with insomnia as operationalized by MSLT is associated with higher diurnal urinary cortisol than those without hyperarousal, but not differential pre-sleep salivary cortisol. Zolpidem relative to placebo reduced pre-sleep salivary cortisol in all subjects, but not diurnal urinary cortisol. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Sleep disorders are frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD). Apart from the occurrence of REM behavior disorders, in the early phase of the disease standard sleep macrostructure evaluation was inconclusive.
   Objective: We analyzed non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep microstructure (CAP) in a group of PD patients to provide an objective measure of sleep disruption.
   Methods: We recruited 31 PD patients [mean age 59.5 +/- 12.4 years; mean Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) stage: 3.4 +/- 1.8] and 34 age-matched non-parkinsonian subjects (mean age 61.5 +/- 15.2 years) as a control group. All patients underwent full-night laboratory polysomnography (PSG). Conventional sleep macro/microstructure analysis was performed. Patients were then divided into two groups: group 1 (H-Y stage <= 2) and group 2 (H-Y stage >= 3). Results: In group 2 PD patients compared to controls, alterations of both sleep macrostructure and microstructure were found. The PD subgroup with milder disease (group 1) presented sleep macrostructure, movements and respiratory parameters not significantly different from controls, although their CAP rate was significantly higher and the proportion of the A1 phase of CAP was reduced (p = 0.03). Multivariate logistic regression showed that disease duration, disease severity, and arousal index emerged as independent predictive factors for CAP rate >= 55% and the A1 phase of CAP <= 40% (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The main result of our study consists in the disclosure of altered NREM sleep microstructure in PD even at an early stage of the disease, suggesting an early alteration of the central pathways involved in the NREM sleep building-up and stability.

AB Background: Recent studies have directly compared the effects of Internet-based self-help interventions with face-to-face (FtF) treatment, but groups may also differ regarding other aspects, aside from the fact that the former is online and the latter offline. Thus, we examined the effects of a brief three-session psychotherapy for insomnia that was delivered FtF or through synchronous text-based chats.
   Methods: Seventy-three patients diagnosed with insomnia were randomized to either FtF treatment, a chat-based treatment, or to a waiting list control group (WL). Treatment included topics that covered imagination, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, repetition, and consolidation.
   Results: Compared to WL, patients in both groups improved regarding sleep quality (d(FtF) = 1.02, d(chat) = 1.69) and improvements remained at the two-month follow-up (FU; d(FtF) = 1.18, d(chat) = 2.40). Improvements in actigraphic sleep onset latency that had been gained at the post-test time point, disappeared at FU, while subjective improvements remained. At FU, patients in the chat group outperformed FtF patients regarding subjective total sleep time, anxiety, depression, and cognitive pre-sleep arousal.
   Conclusion: Three sessions were efficacious in treating insomnia, and the chat-based treatment slightly outperformed FtF treatment. This may be caused by the highly individualized treatment approach, by the fact that chatting forces both patients and therapists to adhere to the essence of the treatment goal, by increased feelings of privacy, autonomy, and a sense of felt responsibility for treatment. These hypotheses should be validated in future studies. So far, we can summarize that chat-based communication facilitates the treatment of patients who cannot or who do not want to attend FtF treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: As the relationships of sleep-wake schedule and mealtime with children's behaviors have not often been studied together, we investigated the relationships of these lifestyles variables with preschool children's well-being.
   Methods: Using a network survey, we investigated several lifestyle variables of 1000 families with preschool children.
   Results: Our previous articles reported that preschool children's bedtime was delayed by the compulsory nap routine in Japanese nursery schools. The present study revealed similar results. We conducted a cluster analysis with children's meal and sleep time data, which yielded five different lifestyle groups. Cluster 1 was characterized by "extremely late and irregular" meal and sleep times; similar to Cluster 1, Cluster 2 was a "late and irregular" lifestyle group. Cluster 3 was a "mildly late" lifestyle group. Cluster 4 was an "early bird and regular lifestyle" group, and Cluster 5 resembled the "early bird and regular lifestyle" group on weekdays, but was "late and irregular on weekends." It was found that the later and more irregular the children's meal and sleep times, the worse their physical and mental condition. Even for Cluster 5, the children who had early and regular meal and sleep times on weekdays, getting up and having breakfast late and irregularly on weekends showed worse physical and mental conditions. These problematic symptoms observed in children with late meal and sleep times on weekends might be partly associated with the irregularity of their habits and partly associated with delayed mealtime, especially for breakfast (brunch).
   Conclusion: A stable lifestyle, including a regular sleep and wake schedule and mealtime, is important for preschool children's mental and physical health. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cardiovascular risk (CR) is associated with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). This association enhances the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); nevertheless, data from hospitalized populations and interactions among these conditions remain unclear. Purpose: To evaluate the risk of MACE in the population with risk of OSAHS using the STOP-BANG questionnaire.
   Methods: We performed a prospective study in an academic hospital from 2017 to 2018. Data included demography, admissions, STOP-BANG score and CR using AHA scores. The primary outcome was risk of MACE in participants with low risk of OSAHS (STOP-BANG 0-2 points), risk of OSAHS (>= 3 points) and risk of moderate/severe OSAHS (>= 5 points). Risk of MACE was evaluated using odds ratios (OR), and average CR was evaluated using the t-test.
   Results: A total of 441 participants were included. The cumulative prevalence of STOP BANG >= 3 points was 80.9%, and that of >= 5 points was 41.6%. OR of MACE >= 3 points was 3.93 (CI 2.08-7.24) (p < 0.001) compared with < 3 points, and Average CR was 10.91% (SD +/- 2.13) at < 3 points versus 24.3% (SD +/- 1.24) for (>= 3 points) for (>= 5 points) OR of MACE was 1.72 (CI 1.18-2.59) (p = 0.005) and average CR was 26.14% (SD +/- 1.63). However, after multivariable analysis, gender differences and previous heart failure were independently associated to MACE.
   Conclusion: The risk of OSAHS in the hospitalized population is high. This population has a higher risk of MACE and higher CRs than do low-risk participants. Conversely, gender and heart failure are potential cofounders. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: The usefulness and diagnostic value of new-generation pacemakers (PM) with enhanced monitoring capabilities are not yet clearly established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility and accuracy of a PM-incorporated respiratory monitoring algorithm and its interaction with atrial fibrillation (AF).
   Methods: A single-center prospective study was performed in consecutive patients who underwent PM implantation featuring a respiratory monitoring algorithm. All patients had polysomnography recording. The respiratory disturbance index of the polysomnography and pacemaker (RDI-PM) were recorded on the same night. Occurrence and burden of AF were also recorded. The diagnostic utility of RDI-PM and its interaction with AF were evaluated.
   Results: A total of 81 patients were included (age 73 +/- 11 years). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) was diagnosed in 62%. RDI-PM had good diagnostic accuracy for OSAS (area under the curve: 0.767 [95% CI: 0.65-0.88]; p < 0.001), with an ideal diagnostic cut-off of 13.3 (sensitivity 78%; specificity 78%) and 90% sensitivity for the diagnosis of moderate-to-severe OSAS. Time to AF first episode and total AF burden were not significantly different between patients with and without OSAS. However, in those whose OSAS diagnosis was based on RDI-PM, there was a significantly greater AF burden in patients with vs without OSAS (cut-off >= 13,488 vs 83 min, p = 0.05). In patients with AF, the RDI-PM cut-off of 13.3 decreased specificity (57%) vs the general population, but in patients without AF the specificity was 100% and sensitivity 77%.
   Conclusion: OSAS was prevalent in PM patients. RDI-PM diagnosed OSAS accurately, with high sensitivity for the detection of moderate-to-severe OSAS, making it a suitable screening method. AF, however, significantly decreased the specificity of RDI-PM for OSAS diagnosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that sleep and depression have independent effects on brain development and plasticity in adolescents, and that these changes are reflected in changes in the epigenome.
   Methods: Participants were 17 medication-free adolescent boys (age 16.05 +/- 0.80 years, mean +/- standard deviation (SD); eight cases with depression and sleep symptoms, nine healthy controls). Sleep was assessed by polysomnography recordings and the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Participants underwent a clinical evaluation. DNA methylation of blood leukocytes was measured by Illumina 450K array, and Ingenuity Pathway analysis was applied to identify the most significant pathways with differentially methylated positions (DMPs). Secondary analysis of the identified loci included linear correlations between methylation and the subjectively rated scales of sleep, depression and sleep microarchitecture.
   Results: Due to small sample size, we found no genome-wide significant differences in methylation between cases and controls. However, pathway analysis identified the synaptic long-term depression (LTD) canonical pathway (p = 0.00045) when the best 500 DMPs from the original case-control design were included. A flattened dissipation of slow wave sleep, tiredness and depression severity values correlated with five of 10 sites from the LTD pathway (IGF1R, PLAG16, PLA2R1, PPP2C5 and ERK12) in the secondary analysis when the case-control status was controlled for.
   Conclusion: Among adolescents, depressive disorder with sleep symptoms is associated with a distinctive epigenetic pattern of DNA methylation in blood leukocytes. The enrichment of DMPs on genes related to synaptic LTD emphasizes the role of sleep in synaptic plasticity and the widespread physiological consequences of disturbed sleep. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: We aimed to analyze associations of sleep disturbance, including sleep disordered breathing, sleep fragmentation, and sleep efficiency, with abnormal nocturnal blood pressure (BP) profiles that may be risk factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
   Methods: The study included 5854 community residents with 20,725 multi-day measurements. Sleep fragmentation and efficiency were evaluated using a wrist-worn activity monitor. Sleep disordered breathing was assessed using the 3% oxygen desaturation index corrected for actigraphy-determined sleep duration. A timer-equipped standard cuff-oscillometric device was used for home and sleep BP monitoring.
   Results: Mean nocturnal systolic BP (SBP) change was -8.6 +/- 9.7% (-11.1 +/- 12.6 mmHg), and inter-day correlation coefficient of the nocturnal SBP change was 0.443. Results of a linear mixed model analysis using daily measured values identified lower sleep efficiency (coefficient = -0.130, p < 0.001) as a determinant for decreased nocturnal SBP dipping beyond the interday variations of these parameters. Number of nocturnal urinations was another strong determinant (coefficient = 1.191, p < 0.001), although the association of sleep efficiency was independent of nocturnal urination, awake SBP, and sleep disordered breathing (coefficient = -0.102, p < 0.001). Sleep efficiency was also independently associated with sleep SBP level (coefficient = -0.138, p < 0.001). Estimated differences in nocturnal SBP dipping and sleep SBP level as a function of the degree of sleep efficiency (less than 80%) reached 1.63% (1.09-2.17%) and 2.16 mmHg (1.49-2.82%), respectively.
   Conclusion: More attention should be paid to sleep efficiency as a factor in maintaining circadian BP rhythm. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   CLINICAL-EFFICACY; DOUBLE-BLIND; PLACEBO; RLS; METAANALYSIS; DEFICIENCY
AB Objective: Restless legs syndrome (RLS)is a common neurological disorder of unclear pathophysiology that appears to involve an iron deficiency in the brain. Some studies, but not others, suggest that intravenous injection of iron can reduce RLS severity.
   Method: The databases Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and SinoMed were searched for randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and case-control studies of intravenous iron therapy to treat RLS. Eligible studies were meta-analyzed using Stata 12.0.
   Results: This analysis indicated that IV iron was more efficacious than placebo in treating RLS (OR: 4.71,95% CI 4.21-5.21, p < 0.0001). According to sub-group analysis, either IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) or iron sucrose was more efficacious than placebo in treating RLS. Adverse events did not differ significantly between patients receiving intravenous iron or placebo (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.92-3.07, p = 0.093). The present study also indicated after accepting IV iron treatment the IRLS score in RLS patients decreased (OR = 6.75,95% CI 4.02-9.49, p < 0.0001). The subgroup analysis showed that IV iron dextran, iron sucrose, and FCM could alleviate the IRLS score.
   Conclusion: The available evidence suggests that intravenous iron is effective and tolerable for patients with RLS regardless of peripheral iron status. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LA English

DE Cataplexy; Narcolepsy; Niemann-Pick type C Disease; Angelman Syndrome;
   Norrie Disease; Prader-Willi Syndrome
ID CLINICAL-ASPECTS; DISEASE; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; DEFICIENCY
AB Cataplexy is a transient loss of muscle tone that can be triggered by emotions such as laughter, excitement or fear. Other causes of cataplexy include Niemann-Pick type C Disease, Angelman Syndrome, Norrie Disease, Prader-Willi Syndrome. In addition, cataplexy can be a side effect of several drugs (eg, lamotrigine, clozapine, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate). Yet, the most prevalent causes of cataplexy without narcolepsy are rare genetic diseases; which explains why cataplexy is classically linked to narcolepsy. Therefore, it is essential disconnecting cataplexy from narcolepsy especially in pediatric population and after use of a few medications. In this review, we described few conditions of cataplexy not related to narcolepsy. We performed a review of literature (MEDLINE and EMBASE database), without limited date or publication restrictions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   OUTCOMES
AB Background: Criteria of asthma severity and control lack standardization.
   Objective: to compare classifications of asthma severity and control, applied to patients from a severe asthma clinic.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study of 473 patients followed up for >= 6 months, reclassified using three criteria: 1) the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010, 2) the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2000, and 3) the European Respiratory Society (ERS)/ATS 2014. In order to evaluate disease control, the 2012 and 2014 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) classifications were compared.
   Results: According to the definition of WHO 2010, 429 had Difficult-to-treat severe asthma and only 12 presented Treatment-resistant severe asthma. 114 patients had Refractory asthma by ATS 2000 and 88 had Severe asthma by ERS/ATS 2014. Considering the definitions of WHO 2010, only 9 out of 12 with Treatment-resistant and 64 out of 429 with Difficult-to-treat severe asthma met the criteria of ATS 2000 and ERS/ATS 2014. As for GINA classification of control, 208 (44%) of the 473 subjects were classified as having asthma controlled by the 2014 criteria, whereas only 45 (10%) patients had controlled asthma by the GINA 2012 criteria. The Kappa statistic indicates the highest agreement of the severity classification occurred between the criteria of ATS 2000 and ERS/ATS 2014 (0.64).
   Conclusion: Good agreement was found between Refractory asthma ATS 2000 and Severe asthma ERS/ATS 2014 classifications. However, poor agreement was observed between the severity rating proposed by the WHO and other classifications. The GINA control classifications of 2012 and 2014 also agreed poorly.

AB Introduction: Over the last decade, new evidence and many guidelines have been published on COPD pharmacological treatments; prescriptions are often not in accordance with guidelines.
   Materials and methods: Trends in physician treatment choices from February 2012 to November 2018 (Feb. 2012/Nov. 2018) were analyzed using data from COPD patients (spirometry-confirmed diagnosis) included in the COLIBRI-COPD cohort. Inhaled drug treatments (short-or long-acting beta 2-agonist [SABA or LABA], short-or long-acting anticholinergic [SAMA or LAMA], or corticosteroid [ICS]) were classified into 5 treatment categories: "No initial maintenance treatment (IMT)" (untreated, or only SAMA or SABA); "1 long-acting bronchodilator (LABD)" (LABA or LAMA); "2 LABDs" (LABA + LAMA); "1 LABD + ICS" (LABA or LAMA + ICS); " 2 LABDs+ICS" (LABA+LAMA+ICS). For the purpose of the study, 4 periods were defined to achieve balanced samples (T1-T4).
   Results: Data from 4537 patients were collected. Over time, 3 major changes were observed: (1) an increase in treatment category "No IMT", mostly for GOLD 1 or GOLD A categories (GOLD A: from 19.1% at T1 to 41.2% at T4); (2) an increase in treatment category "2 LABDs" for GOLD 2 to 4 and GOLD A to D categories (GOLD B: from 15.4% to 29.7%); (3) a decrease in ICS use ("1 LABD + ICS" or "2 LABDs + ICS"), mostly for GOLD 1 to 3 and GOLD A categories (GOLD A, 2 LABDs + ICS: from 35.3% to 11.1%).
   Conclusion: Changes over time in therapeutic profiles suggest that new evidence from scientific publications and recommendations may have had a rapid impact on clinical practice.

AB Traditional medicine may not control bronchial asthma. Many patients have uncontrolled symptoms and the underlying ongoing inflammation is persistent.
   Objective: to assess efficacy of laser acupuncture in improving asthma symptoms and underlying oxidative stress through monitoring exhaled 8-isoprostane.
   Method: 48 asthmatic (case group) received successive low level laser acupuncture sessions to stimulate acupoints for chronic asthma and 24 asthmatics received deactivated laser acupuncture sessions (control group). Asthma symptoms, asthma control questionnaire, concentration of 8-Isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate and airway resistance were assessed before and after laser acupuncture therapy.
   Results: After the completion of the course of laser acupuncture therapy, we observed significant improvement of asthma symptoms. Asthma control questionnaire improved from 9.7 +/- 3.3 to 21.8 +/- 3.6 (p 0.001). EBC 8-Isoprostane dropped from 14.7 +/- 5.4 to 8.1 +/- 5.0 (p 0.001). The airway resistance at R5 and R20 significantly decreased from 116.6 +/- 25.8 & 124.5 +/- 31.2 to 101.5 +/- 25.6 & 110.9 +/- 29.9 respectively (p 0.001). Control patients who received sham acupuncture therapy did not show such improvement.
   Conclusion: Laser acupuncture is an effective modality in treating bronchial asthma as evidenced by improved symptoms, airway resistance, and oxidative biomarkers.

AB Background: We explored the impact of FVC decline on subsequent FVC decline and mortality in the INPULSIS trials of nintedanib in patients with IPF and their open-label extension, INPULSIS-ON.
   Methods: Changes in FVC and mortality between weeks 24 and 52 of the INPULSIS trials were assessed in patients with an increase/no decline in FVC % predicted and with declines in FVC < 10% and >= 10% predicted from baseline to week 24. Changes in FVC and mortality in the first year of INPULSIS-ON were assessed in patients treated with nintedanib in the preceding INPULSIS trial who did and did not have a decline in FVC >= 10% predicted at week 52.
   Results: The proportion of placebo-treated patients with decline in FVC >= 10% predicted between weeks 24 and 52 of INPULSIS was similar in patients with increase/no decline in FVC and with decline in FVC >= 10% predicted between baseline and week 24 ( 20.5% and 18.9%, respectively). Mortality between weeks 24 and 52 of INPULSIS was higher in patients with FVC decline >= 10% predicted than < 10% predicted between baseline and week 24 ( 13.2% vs 3.8%). Among nintedanib-treated patients in INPULSIS who had decline in FVC >= 10% versus < 10% predicted at week 52, 34.0% versus 21.4%, respectively, had decline in FVC >= 10% predicted in the first year of INPULSIS-ON. Mortality in the first year of INPULSIS-ON was 21.3% vs 5.7% in these groups, respectively.
   Conclusions: Decline in FVC did not predict FVC decline but was associated with mortality in patients with IPF.

AB Background: Supplemental oxygen is a recommended therapy option in stable hypoxemic COPD patients. Often, supplemental oxygen is provided by continuous flow (CF). However, demand oxygen delivery systems (DODS) that provide an oxygen bolus only during inspiration have gained increasing use as they prolong oxygen cylinder life (beside battery life). However, there is a lack of evidence if different DODS and CF devices are equivalent.
   Methods: Seventy hypoxemic COPD patients (FEV1 32 +/- 9% predicted, PaO2 56 +/- 7 mmHg) on long-term oxygen therapy were included in this prospective single-blinded, randomized cross-over trial. Following an initial incremental shuttle walk test, patients performed 3 endurance shuttle walk tests (ESWT) at 85% of their maximum walking speed in random order with: (A) CF (ESWT-CF), (B) a DODS based on liquid oxygen (ESWT-DL) and (C) an DODS oxygen concentrator (ESWT-DC). The primary outcome was oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) at ESWT isotime. Secondary outcomes were total ESWT duration, heart rate (HR) and breathing frequency (BF) at isotime and dyspnea at end-exercise.
   Results: SpO(2) at ESWT isotime was not clinically different between devices: 90 +/- 4% (CF), 89 +/- 5% (DL) and 90 +/- 5% (DC). However, 20% of the patients showed a >= 4% lower oxygen desaturation while using a DODS device. Secondary outcomes were similar under the three conditions.
   Conclusion: Oxygen supplementation via DODS (based on liquid oxygen or as a concentrator) yielded comparable physiological effects during standardized walking in stable hypoxemic COPD patients like CF. However, 20% of patients showed a clinically relevant lower oxygen saturation while using a DODS device. Therefore, we suggest individual testing of oxygen saturation of DODS suitability.

AB The endothelial cells play a crucial role in the progression of angiogenesis, which causes cell re-modulation, proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion and survival. Angiogenic factors like cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, vasoactive peptides, proteolytic enzymes (metalloproteinases) and plasminogen activators bind to their receptors on endothelial cells and activate the signal transduction pathways like epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) which initiate the process of angiogenesis.
   Cytokines that stimulate angiogenesis include direct and indirect proangiogenic markers. The direct proangiogenic group of markers consists of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) whereas the indirect proangiogenic markers include transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).
   VEGF and FGF-2 are the strongest activators of angiogenesis which stimulate migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in existing vessels to generate and stabilize new blood vessels. VEGF is released in hypoxic conditions as an effect of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1 alpha) and causes re-modulation and inflammation of bronchi cell. Cell re-modulation and inflammation leads to the development of various lung disorders like pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, fibrosis and lung cancer.
   This indicates that there is a firm link between overexpression of VEGF and FGF-2 with lung disorders. Various natural and synthetic drugs are available for reducing the overexpression of VEGF and FGF-2 which can be helpful in treating lung disorders. Researchers are still searching for new angiogenic inhibitors which can be helpful in the treatment of lung disorders.
   The present review emphasizes on molecular mechanisms and new drug discovery focused on VEGF and FGF-2 inhibitors and their role as anti-angiogenetic agents in lung disorders.

AB The term ultra-LABA indicates once-daily beta 2-AR agonists (abediterol, indacaterol, olodaterol and vilanterol) that are single enantiomers of the (R)-configuration. All have a near full-agonist profile at human beta 2-AR. They can be prescribed in asthmatics only when associated with an with ICS, although further confirmations need to clarify what really these agents add if used in association to ICS and in what asthmatic patients this association may have more value. They are also under development in triple inhalers that include an ultra-LABA, a LAMA and an ICS. The once-daily posology might increase adherence in long-term treatment of asthma but superiority to twice-daily LABAs has not yet been fully demonstrated. In any case, still no ultra-LABA can be recommended as preferred.

AB Background: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) decrease airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Previous studies have generally investigated the effect of ICS on methacholine-induced AHR following weeks or months of medium to high dose treatment.
   Purpose: The short-term effects of once-daily fluticasone furoate (FF) 100 mcg on methacholine-induced AHR and airway inflammation were examined over the course of one week.
   Methods: Eleven mild asthmatics completed this randomized, double-blind crossover study. Once-daily FF (100 mcg) and identical appearing placebo Ellipta (R) inhalers were given for 7 days with a 2-week washout. Methacholine challenges were performed before and 24 h after the first, third and seventh doses. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was measured initially and at 7 days.
   Results: FF significantly (p = 0.0009-0.0078) increased methacholine PD20 (provocative dose causing 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s) at all times. Doubling dose shifts (95% CI) were 1.23 (0.60-1.86), 1.17 (0.68-1.67) and 1.44 (0.93-1.94) after the first, third and seventh dose respectively. FeNO (geometric mean, 95% CI) decreased significantly (p = 0.0049) following FF treatment from 37.9 ppb (23.7-60.5) initially to 22.9 ppb (14.8-35.5) at 7 days. Placebo did not affect methacholine PD20 or FeNO.
   Conclusion: Single-dose FF 100 mcg decreased methacholine AHR at 24 h without significant further improvement with continued daily use over 7 days. The inhibition in AHR after one week of daily dosing coincided with a significant decrease in FeNO at 7 days. Contrary to past assumptions, the ICS FF appears to rapidly reduce AHR to methacholine.

AB Spirometry is the current gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). However, many current and former smokers who do not meet established spirometric criteria for the diagnosis of this disease have symptoms and clinical courses similar to those with diagnosed COPD. Large longitudinal observational studies following individuals at risk of developing COPD offer us additional insight into spirometric patterns of disease development and progression. Analysis of forced expiratory maneuver changes over time may allow us to better understand early changes predictive of progressive disease. This review discusses the theoretical ability of spirometry to capture fine pathophysiologic changes in early airway disease, highlights the shortcomings of current diagnostic criteria, and reviews existing evidence for spirometric measures which may be used to better detect early airflow impairment.

AB Introduction: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetically heterogeneous disorder of motile cilia, which leads to recurrent and chronic airway infections. Detailed information about infection causing pathogens is scarce. With this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence and susceptibility of the most common respiratory pathogens in PCD patients retrospectively in a cross-sectional and the dynamics of the microbiological diversity in a longitudinal study.
   Methods: Microbiological and clinical data of 106 patients between 2010 and 2016 were analysed cross-sectionally and of 28 patients longitudinally. Dynamics in microbiological diversity were assessed by calculating the mean rate of alteration (MRA).
   Results: Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen (n=41; 38.7%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n=36; 34%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n=18; 17%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=16; 15.1%). Nontuberculous mycobacteria were cultured from two patients (1.9%). H. influenzae was the most prevalent pathogen in children (n=31; 45.6%), S. aureus in adults (n=15; 39%). Two patients were infected by methicillin-resistant S. aureus. P. aeruginosa was mostly susceptible to standard antibiotics with highest rates of resistance against fosfomycin (63.6%; 7/11). The culture of P. aeruginosa correlated negatively with age adjusted FEV1% predicted (p=0.04), while the MRA was positively associated with age (rho 0.411, p=0.032).
   Discussion: In PCD patients, the prevalence of pathogens differed in children and adults with H. influenzae and S. aureus being the most common pathogens in children, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in adults, respectively. Unexpectedly, the MRA increased by age.

AB Rationale: Real-world data on pirfenidone treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are limited. This study assessed the effectiveness of pirfenidone in a large real-life Italian IPF cohort.
   Methods: IRENE was an observational, retrospective study of patients with IPF treated with pirfenidone in routine clinical practice (18 centres). At Month 6, a mandatory re-evaluation of forced vital capacity (FVC) decline (absolute change < 10%) was required to continue pirfenidone. The primary effectiveness outcomes were absolute change from baseline in FVC and the percentage of patients with >= 10% absolute decline in % predicted FVC at Month 12. Safety was described by adverse event (AE) occurrence. Prespecified subgroups included sex, age, presence/absence of emphysema, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on high-resolution computed tomography, and baseline lung function.
   Results: The study included 379 patients (mean age, 67.6 years; 78.1% male). Mean change from baseline in FVC and the percentage of patients with >= 10% absolute decline in % predicted FVC at Month 12 were -81.8 mL (SD, 419.6 mL; P=0.002) and 16.0% (95% CI, 12.2-20.9%), respectively. Disease progression was similar across prespecified subgroups, including patients with definite vs possible UIP. Overall, 211 AEs occurred in 149 patients (39.3%), with serious AEs in 31 patients (8.2%) and 9 discontinuations due to AEs. Skin and gastrointestinal AEs were most frequent. Fifteen patients (4.0%) died.
   Conclusions: The decline in FVC and the safety profile observed in this real-world IPF cohort were consistent with the findings of the Phase III pirfenidone trials.

AB RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures are critical for RNA cellular functions. However, structure prediction for large and complex RNAs remains a challenge, which hampers our understanding of RNA structure-function relationship. We here report a new web server, the VfoldLA server (http://rna.physics.missouri.edu/vfoldLA), for the prediction of RNA 3D structures from nucleotide sequences and base-pair information (2D structure). This server is based on the recently developed VfoldLA, a model that classifies the single-stranded loops (junctions) into four different types and according to the loop-helix connections, assembles RNA 3D structures from the loop/junction templates. The VfoldLA web server provides a user-friendly online interface for a fully automated prediction of putative 3D RNA structures using VfoldLA. With a single-RNA or RNA-RNA complex sequence and 2D structure as input, the server generates structure(s) with the JSmol visualization along with a downloadable PDB file. The output result may serve as useful scaffolds for future structure refinement studies.

Recent advancements in the field of DNA/RNA nanotechnology successfully used DNA/RNA as programmable molecules to construct molecular machines and nanostructures with predefined shapes and functions. The key mechanism for dynamic control of the conformations of these DNA/RNA nanodevices is a reaction called strand displacement, in which one strand in a formed duplex is replaced by a third invading strand. While DNA/RNA strand displacement has mainly been used to de novo design molecular devices, we argue in this review that this reaction is also likely to play a key role in multiple cellular events such as gene recombination, CRISPR-based genome editing, and RNA cotranscriptional folding. We introduce the general mechanism of strand displacement reaction, give examples of its use in the construction of molecular machines, and finally review natural processes having characteristic which suggest that strand displacement is occurring.

AB Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important role in characterizing Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) structure, augmenting information from experimental techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). In this work, we examine the accuracy of structural representation resulting from application of a number of explicit and implicit solvent models and refinement protocols against experimental data ranging from high density of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) restraints to completely unrestrained simulations. For a prototype A-form RNA helix, our results indicate that AMBER RNA force field with either implicit or explicit solvent can produce a realistic dynamic representation of RNA helical structure, accurately cross-validating with respect to a diverse array of NMR observables. In refinement against NMR distance restraints, modern MD force fields are found to be equally adequate, with high fidelity cross-validation to the residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and residual chemical shift anisotropies (RCSAs), while slightly over-estimating structural order as monitored via NMR relaxation data. With restraints trimmed to encode only for base pairing information, cross-validation quality significantly deteriorates, now exhibiting a pronounced dependence on the choice of the solvent model. This deterioration is found to be partially reversible by increasing planarity restraints on the nucleobase geometry. For completely unrestrained MD simulations, the choice of water model becomes very important, with the best performing TIP4P-Ew accurately reproducing both the RDC and RCSA data, while closely matching the NMR-derived order parameters. The information provided here will serve as a foundation for MD-based refinement of solution state NMR structures of RNA.

AB ALECT2 (leukocyte chemotactic factor 2) amyloidosis is one of the most recently identified amyloid-related diseases, with LECT2 amyloids commonly found in different types of tissues. Under physiological conditions, LECT2 is a 16 kDa multifunctional protein produced by the hepatocytes and secreted into circulation. The pathological mechanisms causing LECT2 transition into the amyloid state are still largely unknown. In the case of ALECT2 patients, there is no disease-causing mutation, yet almost all patients carry a common polymorphism that appears to be necessary but not sufficient to directly trigger amyloidogenesis. In this work, we followed a reductionist methodology in order to detect critical amyloidogenic "hot-spots" during the fibrillation of LECT2. By associating experimental and computational assays, this approach reveals the explicit amyloidogenic core of human LECT2 and pinpoints regions with distinct amyloidogenic properties. The fibrillar architecture of LECT2 polymers, based on our results, provides a wealth of detailed information about the amyloidogenic "hot-spot" interactions and represents a starting point for future peptide-driven intervention in ALECT2 amyloidosis.

AB Despite significant advances in all aspects of single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), specimen preparation still remains a challenge. During sample preparation, macromolecules interact with the air-water interface, which often leads to detrimental effects such as denaturation or adoption of preferred orientations, ultimately hindering structure determination. Randomly biotinylating the protein of interest (for example, at its primary amines) and then tethering it to a cryo-EM grid coated with two-dimensional crystals of streptavidin (acting as an affinity surface) can prevent the protein from interacting with the air-water interface. Recently, this approach was successfully used to solve a high-resolution structure of a test sample, a bacterial ribosome. However, whether this method can be used for samples where interaction with the air-water interface has been shown to be problematic remains to be determined. Here we report a 3.1 angstrom structure of an RNA polymerase II elongation complex stalled at a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesion (Pol II EC(CPD)) solved using streptavidin grids. Our previous attempt to solve this structure using conventional sample preparation methods resulted in a poor quality cryo-EM map due to Pol II EC(CPD)'s adopting a strong preferred orientation. Imaging the same sample on streptavidin grids improved the angular distribution of its view, resulting in a high-resolution structure. This work shows that streptavidin affinity grids can be used to address known challenges posed by the interaction with the air-water interface.

AB Yersinia enterocolitica is a pectinolytic zoonotic foodborne pathogen, the genome of which contains pectin-binding proteins and several different classes of pectinases, including polysaccharide lyases (PLs) and an exopolygalacturonase. These proteins operate within a coordinated pathway to completely saccharify homogalacturonan (HG). Polysaccharide lyase family 2 (PL2) is divided into two major subfamilies that are broadly-associated with contrasting 'endolytic' (PL2A) or 'exolytic' (PL2B) activities on HG. In the Y. enterocolitica genome, the PL2A gene is adjacent to an independent carbohydrate binding module from family 32 (YeCBM32), which possesses a N-terminal secretion tag and is known to specifically bind HG. Independent CBMs are rare in nature and, most commonly, are fused to enzymes in order to potentiate catalysis. The unconventional gene architecture of YePL2A and YeCBM32, therefore, may represent an ancestral relic of a fission event that de coupled PL2A from its cognate CBM. To provide further insight into the evolution of this pectinolytic locus and the molecular basis of HG depolymerisation within Y. enterocolitica, we have resurrected a YePL2A-YeCBM32 chimera and demonstrated that the extant PL2A digests HG more efficiently. In addition, we have engineered a tryptophan from the active site of the exolytic YePL2B into YePL2A (YePL2A-K291W) and demonstrated, using X-ray crystallography of substrate complexes, that it is a structural determinant of exo-activity within the PL2 family. In this manner, surrogate structural platforms may assist in the study of phylogenetic relationships informed by extant and resurrected sequences, and can be used to overcome challenging structural problems within carbohydrate active enzyme families.

DT Article

AB The cofactor-less dioxygenase AqdC of Mycobacteroides abscessus catalyzes the cleavage and thus inactivation of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone), which plays a central role in the regulation of virulence factor production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We present here the crystal structures of AqdC in its native state and in complex with the PQS cleavage product N-octanoylanthranilic acid, and of mutant AqdC proteins in complex with PQS. AqdC possesses an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold core domain with additional helices forming a cap domain. The protein is traversed by a bipartite tunnel, with a funnel-like entry section leading to an elliptical substrate cavity where PQS positioning is mediated by a combination of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, with the substrate's C4 carbonyl and C3 hydroxyl groups tethered by His97 and the catalytic His246, respectively. The side chain of the AqdC-bound product extends deeper into the "alkyl tail section" of the tunnel than PQS, tentatively suggesting product exit via this part of the tunnel. AqdC prefers PQS over congeners with shorter alkyl substituents at C2. Kinetic data confirmed the strict requirement of the active-site base His246 for catalysis, and suggested that evolution of the canonical nucleophile/His/Asp catalytic triad of the hydrolases to an Ala/His/Asp triad is favorable for catalyzing dioxygenolytic PQS ring cleavage.

AB M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) is a member of the mannose receptor family. Recent evidence shows that PLA2R is a major autoantigen causing idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN), which is an autoimmune disease and one of the most common causes for nephrotic syndrome in adults. The epitope mapping data suggest that the major epitopes of PLA2R locate at the CysR, CTLD1 and CTLD7 domains. However, due to the lack of the high-resolution structural information, it is unclear how the autoantibodies interact with PLA2R. Here we determine the crystal structure of the CTLD7 domain of PLA2R at 1.8 angstrom, showing that it adopts a typical CUD fold, and the structural alignments also provide hints for the potential antibody binding regions. In addition, the high-resolution structural information of CTLD7 could be applied to identify the epitopes for autoantibodies, which would facilitate the therapeutic strategies against IMN.

AB Giardia intestinalis presents an intriguing endomembrane system, which includes endoplasmic reticulum and peripheral vesicles (PVs). The PVs have previously been considered to be organelles that display early and late endosomal and lysosomal properties. Some of these vesicles accumulate macromolecules ingested by the protozoan and show acid phosphatase activity. It has been previously shown that the parasite releases microvesicles, which contribute to giardiasis pathogenesis; however, the vesicles' origin and the way in which they are released by the parasite still remain unclear. In this study, we induced the parasites to encyst in vitro and analyzed these events using advanced electron microscopy techniques, including focused ion beam and electron microscopy tomography followed by three-dimensional reconstruction, in order to better understand protozoal multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis. In addition, we performed an ultrastructural analysis of phosphatase activity during differentiation. We demonstrated that some vegetative trophozoites' PVs exhibited morphological characteristics of MVBs with a mean diameter of 50 nm, containing intraluminal vesicles (ILVs).

AB In many eukaryotes, kinesin-5 motors are essential for mitosis, and small molecules that inhibit human kinesin-5 disrupt cell division. To investigate whether fungal kinesin-5s could be targets for novel fungicides, we studied kinesin-5 from the pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis. We used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the microtubule-bound structure of its motor domain with and without the N-terminal extension. The ATP-like conformations of the motor in the presence or absence of this N-terminus are very similar, suggesting this region is structurally disordered and does not directly influence the motor ATPase. The Ustilago maydis kinesin-5 motor domain adopts a canonical ATP-like conformation, thereby allowing the neck linker to bind along the motor domain towards the microtubule plus end. However, several insertions within this motor domain are structurally distinct. Loop2 forms a non-canonical interaction with a-tubulin, while loop8 may bridge between two adjacent protofilaments. Furthermore, loop5 - which in human kinesin-5 is involved in binding allosteric inhibitors - protrudes above the nucleotide binding site, revealing a distinct binding pocket for potential inhibitors. This work highlights fungal-specific elaborations of the kinesin-5 motor domain and provides the structural basis for future investigations of kinesins as targets for novel fungicides.

AB Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is a nuclear receptor with a key role in metabolic processes and is target of CDK5 kinase phosphorylation at 5245 (S273 in PPAR gamma isoform 2), thereby inducing insulin resistance. A remarkable effort has been addressed to find PPAR gamma ligands that inhibit S245 phosphorylation, but the poor understanding in this field challenges the design of such ligands. Here, through computational and biophysical methods, we explored an experimentally validated model of PPAR gamma-CDK5 complex, and we presented K261, K263 or K265, which are conserved in mammals, as important anchor residues for this interaction. In addition, we observed, from structural data analysis, that PPAR gamma ligands that inhibit 5245 phosphorylation are not in direct contact with these residues; but induce structural modifications in PPAR gamma:CDK5/p25 interface. In summary, our PPAR gamma and CDK5/p25 interaction analyses open new possibilities for the rational design of novel inhibitors that impair 5245 phosphorylation.

AB Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) allows structure determination of macromolecular assemblies that have resisted other structural biology approaches because of their size and heterogeneity. These challenging multi-protein targets are typically susceptible to dissociation and/or denaturation upon cryo-EM grid preparation, and often require crosslinking prior to freezing. Several approaches for gentle on-column or in-tube crosslinking have been developed. On-column crosslinking is not widely applicable because of the poor separation properties of gel filtration techniques. In-tube crosslinking frequently causes sample aggregation and/or precipitation. Gradient-based crosslinking through the GraFix method is more robust, but very time-consuming and necessitates specialised expensive equipment. Furthermore, removal of the glycerol typically involves significant sample loss and may cause destabilization detrimental to the sample quality. Here, we introduce an alternative procedure: AgarFix (Agarose Fixation). The sample is embedded in an agarose matrix that keeps the molecules separated, thus preventing formation of aggregates upon cross-inking. Gentle crosslinking is accomplished by diffusion of the cross-linker into the agarose drop. The sample is recovered by diffusion or electroelution and can readily be used for cryo-EM specimen preparation. AgarFix requires minimal equipment and basic lab experience, making it widely accessible to the cryo-EM community.

AB The Neo-Tethyan Semail Ophiolite in the UAE-Oman region was obducted onto the Arabian continental margin at the end of the Cretaceous. Beneath the ophiolite are thrust-stacked deep-water Mesozoic and older sediments and volcanics that include marine basalts and associated limestones of Middle-Late Permian and Late Triassic age. These limestones are referred to as the Oman 'Exotic' limestones. The Middle-Upper Permian exotics are the rarer exotic type. They were reef build-ups on platforms that sank to ocean depths during rifting, and were later engulfed by intrusive basalts. An area to the east of Al-Ain city, UAE, exposes blocks of richly fossiliferous limestone exotic blocks within Upper Triassic marine basalts. The studied exotics host foraminifera, including Dunbarula mathieut, Verbeekina sp., Tetrataxis sp., Geinitzina sp., Pachyphloia sp., Colaniella leei, and calcareous algae (Mizzia velebitana), rugose corals and abundant crinoids, consistent with a Murghabian-Dzulfian (Middle-Late Permian) age. The exotics lack ooids, show grainstone/packstone lithofacies, are only slightly affected by dolomitization. These features are interpreted in a paleogeographic model, involving an isolated carbonate platform comparable to the Jabal Qamar Formation in the Dibba Zone that subsided during Neo-Tethys rifting in the Late Permian Lopingian (Dzulfian-Dorashamian).

AB Attention has been given to the relevance of chaotic rock units including tectonic, sedimentary, and diapiric melanges in the evolution of subduction-related accretionary complexes but they have often been perceived as relicts in suture zones. Northwest Borneo (West Sabah) was evidently a subduction complex which experienced collision caused by the Proto-South China Sea, and a consequence of post-collision intrusion currently expressed as a 4000-metre high mountain, together with gravity tectonics offshore of Palawan and Borneo. The continuous deformation of the accretionary wedge from the collision to the post-collision stages is, however, a matter of contention, along with the timing as subduction ceased. This study integrates the seismic profiles, field observation and topographic interpretation to show that the backstop is composed of ultramafic rocks and a vast amount of severely sheared pillow basalts and radiolarite. Wide shear-bands also exhibit metric phacoid-shaped blocks of basalt and radiolarite. Successor basins cover these collision features to the west, and through a system of circular basins overlying a shale matrix, engulfing metric blocks of basalts, radiolarite and sandstone. The chaotic rock unit was occasionally brought to the surface and the overlying strata are deformed as circular synclines and anticlines. We, therefore, suspect that the mechanism of exposing the melange involved a diapiric process that pushed this low viscosity material upward. Accordingly, the entire process illustrates a tectonic evolution involving gravity tectonics from the end of the collision to the post-collision setting of northern Borneo.

AB Changes in paleoenvironments from 3500 to 1300 cal. yr BP have been documented by a high-resolution grain-size and organic carbon isotope record in core Z8 from the Shandong mud wedge in the southern Yellow Sea (YS). The sensitive grain-size component, sorting coefficients and delta C-13(org) values were used to identify the paleohydrologic variations and the intensity of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). The coarse fraction of sediment, together with organic isotope and sea surface temperature (SST) data, shows a weak EAWM during 3500-2300 cal. yr BP, a gradual increase in the EAWM from 2300 to 1700 cal. yr BP and an enhanced EAWM since 1700 cal. yr BP. Superimposed on this general trend, several prominent short-lived strong EAWM episodes peaked at approximately 3300, 3100, 2900, 2750, 2620, 2220, 1900, 1700 and 1400 cal. yr BP. The paleoenvironmental record matches ancient Chinese historical climate records as well as socioeconomic changes, with lower economic levels occurring during stronger EAWM episodes. The results show that prosperous stages of ancient Chinese dynasties mainly occurred in weak EAWM periods, while collapses and/or changes in ancient Chinese dynasties generally occurred during cold periods with a strong EAWM. We suggest that the persistent short-lived strengthening of the EAWM could have exerted a remarkable influence on ancient agricultural societies through decreases in both winter temperature and monsoonal precipitation.

AB Here we present the first detailed planktonic and benthic delta C-13 records and benthic foraminiferal assemblage records from the north-eastern Indian Ocean to decipher the palaeoceanographic changes during the last 56 kyr. We identified three different palaeoceanographic stages, clearly differentiated by significant variations in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages and delta C-13 records. The results of this study indicate that productivity was generally higher during the glacial periods than during the Holocene. Comparison of the benthic foraminiferal assemblage distributions and planktonic and benthic delta C-13 records show a significant correlation between productivity and the bottom water oxygenation on glacial-interglacial timescales. Productivity gradually increased during the period between 56 and 27.5 kyr. During this period, the dominance of Melonis spp. and Oridosalis umbonatus were correlated with conditions of intermediate to high surface productivity and moderate bottom water oxygenation. Increased higher equatorial productivity and low bottom water oxygenation during the period between 27.5 and 15 kyr are supported by planktonic delta C-13 and faunal records. During this period, the dominance of benthic foraminifera assemblages characterised by Uvigerina peregrina indicates sustained continuous phytodetritus flux to the seafloor from enhanced surface water productivity and relatively low bottom water oxygenation. The absence or minimal occurrences of high productivity indicating U. peregrina, the dominance of intermediate to low productivity indicating fauna, and relatively low planktonic delta C-13 records suggest low productivity and active deep-water oxygenation after 15 kyr. Concurrent river discharge and rising sea levels during this period are indicated by negative delta O-18 of G. ruber at the site.

AB In this study, more than 1600 seismic recordings from 88 small-to-moderate earthquakes during 2009 and 2013, which were recorded at 36 seismic stations, were used to calculate the high-frequency attenuation parameter (kappa(0)). By comparing the kappa(0) of six seismic stations with neighboring strong motion stations, we observed that the surficial soil layers have aggravated the high-frequency attenuation phenomenon. Besides, we found that stations located in crustal low-velocity anomaly areas maintained higher kappa(0) and those located in high-velocity anomaly areas tended to have lower kappa(0). The correlation between kappa(0) and S-wave velocity anomaly showed that, at the 0-10 km depth range, the kappa(0) values clearly decrease as the velocity anomaly increases. The generalized inversion technique (GIT) was adopted to estimate the Q(f) model of the Sichuan Basin (SB) and Songpan-Garze Orogen (SGO), in accompaniment with the site responses of 28 seismic stations. The derived Q(f) model were similar to those obtained from previous studies. Analyses of site responses revealed that the amplification curves and levels of SB and SGO were significantly different. Then, Site responses estimated from the genetic algorithm and GIT were compared. The site response curves of most stations are similar. For stations having significantly different site responses, we investigated by comparing with the results obtained from accelerograms recorded at nearby strong motion stations by applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) method. The results showed that site responses obtained from the GIT were closer to those of HVSR than those of the genetic algorithm.

AB The Devrekani Massif in the northern part of the Central Pontides (Northern Turkey) provides important clues to the regional tectonics and geodynamic processes associated with Jurassic high grade metamorphic conditions. This study reports new paragenetic assemblages, mineral compositions, whole-rock geochemistry and Ar-40-Ar-39 geochronological data from the paragneisses in the massif, and, discusses the P-T conditions and geodynamic implications of the Jurassic metamorphism during continental extension in the Central Pontides. Upper amphibolite to lower granulite facies paragneisses form one of the main lithological units in the massif. Within these, there are five different mineral parageneses with diagnostic mineral assemblages of: quartz, K-feldspar (An(0-1)Ab(4-26)Or(73-95)), plagioclase (An(18-35)), biotite [X-phl: 0.28-0.57; Mg/(Mg + Fe2+): 0.33-0.61], sillimanite, cordierite [Mg/(Mg + Fe2+); 0.48-0.71] and garnet (Alm(43-80)Grs(0-18)Prp(5-23)And(0-4)Sps(10-33)) with minor hercynite. Based on Na-in-Crd thermometry and GASP barometry results, the peak metamorphic conditions are 775 +/- 25 degrees C and 6 +/- 1 kbar in the massif. The field relations, petrography and bulk chemical data suggest that the paragneisses, derived from shale-wackestone and pelitic sedimentary protoliths, are typical rock lithologies of an active continental margin. They display enrichments in LILE over HFSE, coupled with negative Nb and Ti anomalies, which are geochemical signatures of subduction-related sources. It is likely that the peak metamorphism took place during the Middle-Upper Jurassic period (ca. 174-156 Ma), suggesting that the metamorphic rocks cooled to 300-350 degrees C at ca. 156 Ma. The mineral assemblages reveal that the prograde history passed from sillimanite zone conditions up to the cordierite-garnet-K-feldspar zone. The petrological and geochronological data indicate that the protoliths are related to multiple sources such as volcano-sedimentary successions. We conclude that the Devrekani Massif represents the products of pre-Jurassic sedimentation, and Permo-Carboniferous continental arc magmatism, overprinted by Jurassic metamorphism.

AB Mineral chemistry, petrography and crystal size distributions of Early Miocene mafic and intermediate lavas from the Kepsut Volcanic Complex (KVC) have been studied to decipher magma chamber processes and dynamics beneath northwestern Anatolia. KVC which is a part of the Western Anatolian Volcanic Province comprises lavas represented by various compositions ranging from basaltic andesite to rhyodacite and associated pyroclastics. Basaltic andesite and andesite lavas of the KVC, the focus of this study, present distinct petrographical features such as three plagioclase generations, patchy zoning, oscillatory reverse zoning, sieve textured crystals and clinopyroxene-mantled amphibole that are clear indicators of disequilibrium conditions in magma chamber(s). Petrography, mineral chemistry and crystal size distribution studies of andesite and basaltic andesite lavas of the KVC indicate that magma evolution occurred in four stages: (I) Near-Equilibrium Stage, (II) Mafic Input Stage, (III) Mixing/Mingling Stage and (IV) Pre-eruption Stage. Thermobarometry calculations indicate that crystallization of andesite and basaltic lavas occurred at similar pressure (mid-to-deep crustal depths, 5-7 kbar) but distinct temperature conditions (920-952 degrees C and 921-1069 degrees C, respectively) suggesting that KVC magmas evolved either in the same or different magma chambers at similar depths and experienced open-system processes. Both of these hypotheses are compatible with multistage evolution of the KVC. Combined petrography, mineral chemistry and geothermometry studies on KVC rocks indicate that mixing/mingling processes and subsequent decompression-driven crystallization were the principal mechanisms for the origin of the textural and mineralogical diversity that is characteristic of KVC lavas. Disequilibrium crystallization was probably caused by the influx of a hotter basaltic magma into crustal magma chambers during the first major period of north-south extension in western Anatolia.

AB We collated existing data for the Eocene Langshan mafic rocks (Eocene mafic rocks) and the Miocene potassic c-ultrapotassic mafic rocks (Miocene mafic rocks) in southern Tibet to investigate the tectonic transition from Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust subduction to Indian continental crust subduction. The Eocene mafic rocks have high Na2O contents (K2O/Na2O = 0.03-0.2) and show OIB-like trace element patterns (e.g., positive Nb and Ta anomalies) and depleted radiogenic Sr-Nd isotope compositions (Sr-87/Sr-86 of apatite = 0.7031, epsilon Nd-(t) = +5.1 to +6.1). In contrast, the Miocene mafic rocks have high K2O contents (K2O/Na2O = 1.9-8.5) and exhibit arc like trace element patterns (enrichment in LILEs and depletion in HFSEs) and enriched radiogenic Sr-Nd isotope compositions (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7115-0.7362, epsilon Nd-(t) = -16 to -12.4). The mantle source for the Eocene mafic rocks was generated by reactions between asthenospheric mantle wedge and felsic melts from subducted Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust (outside the field of rutile stability). In contrast, the mantle source of the Miocene mafic rocks was generated by reactions between asthenospheric (or lithospheric) mantle wedge and felsic melts from subducted Indian continental crust. Taking into account the regional tectonic evolution, we propose that break-off of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab and roll-back and/or break-off of the Indian continental slab were the most likely geodynamic mechanisms that led to the production of the Eocene and Miocene mafic rocks, respectively. Therefore, the transition from the Eocene to Miocene mafic rocks in southern Tibet provides an opportunity to understand the tectonic transition from Neo-Tethyan oceanic to Indian continental crust subduction.

AB Singapore bedrock geology is dominated by late Permian to Triassic arc magmatism and a genetically related, essentially Middle to Upper Triassic, marine to fluvial volcano-sedimentary inner forearc succession. These Mesozoic strata are deformed into a pattern of NE-translated ductile brittle deformation structures during the latest Triassic to earliest Jurassic collision and amalgamation of the Sibumasu continental block with the southern part of the Sukhothai Arc. The subduction-related magmatic complex represented in Singapore by the granitic to gabbroic plutons of the Bukit Timah Centre likely acted as a backstop to thrusting at this time. Collisional tectonics drove progressive shortening and steepened earlier-formed inclined asymmetrical folds, culminating in the regional-scale development of a non-coaxial, NE-vergent and NE-facing, fold and thrust system. In Singapore, the Murai Thrust and Pasir Laba Thrust are identified as major elements of this system; both are associated with SW-dipping thrust-imbricate duplex slices. Two distinct early Cretaceous (Berriasian and Barremian) sedimentary successions overstep these collisional tectonic structures. An array of mostly NE-SW and ENE-WSW trending faults and fractures acts as an important control on bedrock unit distribution across Singapore and are most likely generated by Cenomanian dextral shear stress. That stress locally reactivated faults initiated during orogeny, or even earlier. Knowledge of the geotechnical impact of these structural features is critical to both future development and ongoing management of the subsurface in Singapore.

AB The Jiepai deposit, located in the northeastern part of the Miao'ershan-Yuechengling batholith, South China, is characterized by predominant skarn mineralization that formed near the contact between the Silurian biotite granites and the Upper Cambrian carbonate rocks. Jiepai scheelites are recognized as two main generations based on their occurrences, cathodoluminescence (CL) signatures, and REE systematics. Prograde skarn-hosted scheelite I has uniformly dark CL characteristics and LREE-enriched patterns. Retrograde skarn-hosted scheelite Ha is homogeneously dark under CL, and has a slightly MREE-enriched pattern, whereas quartz vein-hosted scheelite IIb is delineated by fine oscillatory CL zones and a relatively flat REE pattern. Additionally, the CL images reveal that both scheelite I and II were modified by later-stage hydrothermal overprints, which occur as ubiquitous overgrowth rims and cutting veins with bright CL signatures, low REE, but similar REE patterns to their precursors. The compositional variations and fluid inclusions in Jiepai scheelites identify episodic pulses of hydrothermal fluids with different properties. The ore-forming fluids with high Nb/Ta, but low Nb, Ta and REY in the early retrograde stage are featured by moderate to high temperature and low to moderate salinity. Under relatively oxidizing conditions, they interacted with the host rock and underwent boiling to precipitate scheelite I. By contrast, the fluids with higher Nb, Ta and REY, but lower Nb/Ta in the late retrograde stage have slightly lower temperature and higher salinity. We therefore speculate that scheelite II may deposit from later magmatic fluids that have experienced continued boiling in more reducing environment.

AB The Cenozoic tectonic deformation in the Madong Shan, especially since the Holocene, is the key to understand stress transfer at the southeastern terminus of the Haiyuan Fault, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. In this work, we explored the uplift pattern of the Madong Shan by combining the form of bedrock channel and river incision rate. The normalized channel steepness (k(sn)) and wideness (k(wn)) indices provided two comparable channel morphologic parameters. To evaluate the differences among the rock uplift, river incision rates were determined by optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the strath terraces along two rivers. The results show that channels in the northern Madong Shan are relatively steeper and narrower, and have the higher shear stress to incise than those in the south. The incision rates in the northern channels were two times higher than those in the southern channels since the late Holocene. The major changes of channel morphometry and incision rates are coinciding spatially with the stress transfer direction along the Haiyuan Fault, rather than the lithologic variations. Therefore, we speculate that the differential bedrock channel form and river incision were mainly controlled by variable tectonic uplift across the Madong Shan with secondary contribution of the lithology. Deformation of the Madong Shan has been continuously driven by the strain transfer along the Haiyuan Fault.

AB The Shillong plateau in northeast India constitutes an actively deforming anticlinal basement uplift in the foreland of the Himalayas in the north and the Indo-Burman ranges in the east. The study aims to document zones of active crustal deformation in the Shillong plateau through the interpretation of the geometry and the quantitative analysis of stream profiles derived from 30-m SRTM DEM.
   Longitudinal profiles of the streams draining the plateau exhibit conspicuous convex upward reaches, mainly to the upstream of faults and in areas of deep river incision. Analysis of river profiles using Hack's stream-gradient index (SL-index) reveals perturbations in profiles and steep channel-gradients in the middle reaches of the streams.
   Spatial distribution of the SL-index brings out extensive zones of anomalously high stream-gradients along the monoclinal flexure at the southern margin of the plateau adjacent to the Dauki fault and along the northern margin, where multiple en echelon faults define step-like topography. In the western part of the plateau, spatial association of zones of high stream-gradients with well-defined fault-scarps is suggestive of active crustal deformation by differential vertical movement along faults.
   The observed spatial distribution of anomalously high stream-gradients is uncorrelated with the lithological variations and hence, perturbations in river profiles and abrupt changes in stream-gradients are suggestive of differential tectonic uplift of the plateau. The study suggests that the rate of active tectonic deformation in the plateau decreases from the east to the west.

AB Basaltic and related-pyroclastic products aged 0.67, 0.46 and 0.2 Ma produced by eruption of Chu' B'luk (Buon Choah), Phu Son (Pass 52, Quang Phu) volcanoes in the Krong No district, and Ea T'ling and Nam Dong volcanoes in the Cu Jut district covers an area of 120 km(2) with a thickness of a few meters to about 80 m. The volcanoes are aligned along a sub-meridian oriented extensional fault, from Phu Son in the south via Chu B'luk, Ea T'ling in the middle to Nam Dong in the north. The basalts are divided into geochemically alkaline and tholeiitic groups, Ne-normative alkaline basalts include samples from the upper layer of Phu Son volcano, those in the Trinh Nu waterfall area (Ea T'ling volcano) and cored samples conducted near the Dray Sap waterfall. Q-normative tholeiitic basalts include all the samples from Chu Bluk and Nam Dong volcanoes, and massive basalts in the lower layer of Phu Son volcano. Geochemically the tholeiitic basalts are vastly different from the alkaline basalts in that they have higher SiO2 (50-55 wt% compared to < 47 wt% in alkaline basalt), Al2O3 (> 14-16 wt % compared to < 14 wt%), lower K2O (< 1.5 wt% compared to > 1.5-2.5 wt%) and lower TiO2 (< 1.8 wt% as compared to > 2 wt% in alkaline basalt). Melting temperature and pressure calculations based on computing primitive melt compositions showed that the tholeiitic basalts may be produced in a narrow temperature range of 1365-1385 degrees C, corresponding to pressure of 1.2-1.6 GPa. The alkaline basalts may be produced in a temperature range between 1400 and 1440 degrees C and pressure varying from 3.1 to 3.35 GPa. Both the tholeiitic and alkaline basalts are free of crustal contamination. They show geochemically similar characteristics to those of continental intraplate basalts although the alkaline basalt show much more enrichment in incompatible elements. The Sr-87/Sr-86 and Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios of the two basaltic groups are quite similar, varying within narrow ranges of, respectively, 0.7038-0.7041, 0.5129-0.51286 but their Pb-206/Pb-204 isotopic ratios vary widely relative to Pb-207/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 suggesting their interaction with different isotopic components and/or isotopic evolution history. Isotopic modeling relative to major mantle isotopic components suggests that the alkaline basalts may be generated by interaction between an N-MORB-like and an enriched mantle type 1 (EM1) at deep levels. The isotopic component is usually known as DUPAL-like regional mantle isotopic anomaly believed to be widespread in SE Asian mantle. The isotopic compositions of tholeiitic basalt may be generated by mixing between the DUPAL-like component with an enriched mantle type 2 (EM2)-like at higher levels in the lithospheric mantle.

AB The Mae Ping shear zone (MPSZ) is one of four major strike-slip systems in Thailand and a key structural element in some models of the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of Southeast Asia. In northwestern Thailand, the MPSZ exposes a similar to 5-km-wide core of intensely deformed high-grade metamorphic and minor undeformed magmatic rocks, the Lan Sang gneiss complex (LSGC). Despite previous efforts to determine the chronology of the LSGC and, ultimately, the MPSZ, the evolution of this gneiss complex remains incompletely resolved. Here we present new zircon and monazite U-(Th-)Pb LA-(MC-)ICP-MS ages and whole-rock geochemical analyses from three peraluminous, high-K (meta)igneous granitic rocks (augen gneiss, sheared granodiorite, undeformed subvolcanic dike) of the LSGC. Our zircon U-Pb dating suggests that the granitic protolith of the augen gneiss intruded metasedimentary basement of Sibumasu as early as similar to 235-220 Ma. Zircon rim and monazite U-(Th-)Pb ages from the same sample attest to periods of metamorphic recrystallization and overgrowth in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic, Early Cretaceous and Eocene. The latter event had started by similar to 45 Ma and culminated in partial melting of the basement gneisses and the intrusion of granodiorite magma into the LSGC at similar to 35 Ma, contemporaneous with ductile deformation along the MPSZ. A late undeformed subvolcanic dike that crosscuts the mylonitic fabric of the calc-silicate and marble core of the MPSZ, dated in this study at similar to 22 Ma, may indicate that ductile shearing had ceased by that time. Thus, our study provides the first evidence for Late Eocene-Early Miocene magmatism in the LSGC.

AB The northern margin of the Qilian Shan is the northernmost edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The deformation timing and geomorphic development along the northern margin of the Qilian Shan are critical to understanding the dynamics of plateau growth. Although previous studies have suggested that thrusting along the middle and westernmost sections of the northern margin of the Qilian Shan began in the middle Miocene, the > 600 km mountain range front may have experienced differential thrusting and exhumation history. We collected 11 apatite fission-track samples along an elevation transect to the south of Jiayuguan to unravel the cooling history and erosion variation of the northern margin of western section of the Qilian Shan. The apatite fission-track ages, fission-track lengths, and thermal modeling suggest a period of rapid exhumation initiated at similar to 15-10 Ma along the northern margin of the Qilian Shan. The new fission-track ages can be divided into three domains with different mean ages. As the distribution of the fission-track ages is tightly confined by tectonic structures among them, we infer that tectonics plays the first-order control on erosion variations. Meanwhile, the strong linkage between erosion rates and glacier distribution may indicate that glacial buzzsaw exerts an important role in mountain building in the northern Qilian Shan. Additionally, combining this result with published data, we suggest that the northern margin of the Qilian Shan experienced a phase of synchronous deformation in the middle Miocene.

AB In this contribution, we present a model of the neotectonic (middle Miocene to recent) development of the Lao Cai Basin located in the Vietnamese segment of the Red River Fault Zone. The model is constructed on the basis of the analysis of mixed-layered illite-smectite composition and vitrinite reflectance analysis of middle Miocene strata. The model is supported by new data on small-scale brittle tectonic structures cutting these strata and is supplemented with C14 dates of Quaternary river terraces. Furthermore, we present the first evidence for paleoseismicity predating the last hundred years in the Lao Cai Basin. Our results show that: (1) the Lao Cai Basin is a graben formed during the left-lateral shift along the Red River Fault Zone due to oblique slip on graben-bounding and graben-cutting strike-slip faults as well as dip slip on graben-cutting normal faults; (2) the exhumation of the middle Miocene strata filling the graben might have amounted up to 2.4 km and took place during the right-lateral shift along the Red River Fault Zone, possibly being affected by the reversal of slip on graben-bounding and graben-cutting faults and, (3) the Lao Cai Basin was affected by M5 + earthquakes, whereas the return period of such earthquakes is more than 370 years but less than ca. 2300 years. Moreover, we tentatively estimate the late Holocene surface uplift rate in the Lao Cai Basin at ca. 7 mm/year.

AB The evolution of the late Holocene environments has been reconstructed on the basis of multiproxy studies of peat sequences. The vegetation response to short-period climate fluctuations has been traced. Early in the late Holocene there were birch forests with oak and other broadleaf trees; vast areas were occupied by forb meadows. Under cooling (3250 yr BP) the shrub pine (Pinus pumila) became the landscape-forming species, and since 2490 yr BP Selaginella selaginoides appeared in abundance. The Little Ice Age was marked by the disappearance of broadleaf trees and widely spread heath land communities. The higher stands of the lake level were related to warmings (3660-3590; 3450-3180; 2960-2840; 2410-2260 cal yr BP). Shallowing coincided with short-term coolings (3590-3450; 3180-2960; 2840-2410; 2260-2150 cal yr BP) marked by reduced precipitations. The dune ridge formation began during the longest cooling accompanied by a minor regression. The dunes were stabilized and a paleosol developed similar to 2340-2260 yr BP. A younger generation of eolian sands developed during the Little Ice Age. An ecological effect of volcanic ashfalls has been estimated. The local biotic components seem to have been most afflicted by the eruption in the north of Iturup in similar to 2100-2300 cal yr BP, when CKr tephra up to 30 cm thick was deposited. The ages of 4 strongest tsunamis that occurred over the last 3660 years were determined. They appeared to be related to the earthquakes with focuses close to Urup Island or south of it. The lake microflora shows ecological effect of the marine water invasions.

AB Multi-proxy record of benthic and planktic foraminifera, total organic carbon and carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from Core SK291/GC15, off the coast of Goa, eastern Arabian Sea reveals significant paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic turnovers during similar to 6000 to 1700 calibrated years before the Present (cal yr BP). Benthic foraminiferal census data was analyzed with multivariate techniques including factor and cluster analyses of highest ranked species from the studied core that enabled to identify seven biofacies. The record suggests centennial to millennial-scale changes in the surface conditions driven by monsoon-linked upwelling in the eastern Arabian Sea during the studied interval. Various benthic biofacies combined with isotope and planktic foraminiferal data suggest that depletion of dissolved oxygen and increase in organic productivity in the study area was caused by intense monsoonal upwelling since the middle Holocene. The results suggest that during 5400-4700 and 3000-2500 cal yr BP the southwest (SW) monsoon was strong leading to intense upwelling in the study area as reflected by increased Globigerina bulloides percentages. These were generally warmer intervals in the northern hemisphere. The SW monsoon significantly weakened (abrupt decrease in G. bulloides population) during 4700-3400 cal yr BP roughly coinciding with a long arid phase in the Indian subcontinent and a cold interval in Europe. Our record suggests an abrupt increase in SW monsoon intensity during similar to 3000 to 2500 cal yr BP, when a pronounced change in benthic biofacies is also noted that suggests a major shift in the sub-surface conditions. Our data document a prolong weak SW monsoon phase beginning at similar to 4600 cal yr BP, little earlier than 4.2 ka event, in the eastern Arabian Sea.

AB A 3D fault morphology model has been constructed from seismic profiles covering the piedmont of the southern Longmen Shan (LMS), eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. It reveals a spatial correlation between an similar to 3.5 km-high geometrical bump on the range front blind ramp (RFBR) and the gap between the 2008 M-w 7.9 Wenchuan and 2013 M-w 6.6 Lushan earthquakes. Sandbox modeling is then used to probe the effects of the geometrical irregularity of the RFBR on fault behaviors and the LMS range front deformation. Sand wedges are designed to thrust over artificial blind ramps, analogous to the thrusting of the LMS orogenic wedge toward the Sichuan Basin through the RFBR. The experiments reproduce the first-order deformation features presented in the southern LMS range front, confirming that along-strike geometrical variations of the RFBR have induced the segmentation of both fault motion and the range front deformation. Their results also suggest that the gap between the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes is located directly within the structural transition zone originating from the geometrical bump on the RFBR. Additionally, there is a duplex structure occurring in the hanging wall of the geometrical bump, which localizes significant shear strain with progressive shortening and represents a fracture zone corresponding to the observed geophysical anomaly (low seismic velocity) underneath the seismic gap. It is likely that this fractured body protected the gap from the ruptures of the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes.

AB Located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, the East Kunlun fault is a west-east left-lateral strike-slip fault that branches out into a horsetail-shaped structure known as the Kunlun-Qinling Fault system (KQFS) at its eastern terminus. The 2017 Jiuzhaigou Ms 7.0 earthquake occurred in this horsetail-shaped structure. The electrical structures of four profiles that cross different sections of the KQFS and Jiuzhaigou earthquake region are obtained in this study. Our results reveal key differences among these sections. The East Kunlun fault is the only electrical boundary in the Maqu section, whereas the Tazang, Bailongjiang, and Guanggaishan-Dieshan faults in the Tazang section form an imbricate fan structure that extends from south to north and merges into a high conductivity layer (HCL) in the mid-lower crust. Alternating high and low resistivity bodies below the KQFS revealed by the magnetotelluric method (MT) may be related to the cause of slip rate segmentation from the East Kunlun fault into the KQFS. The hypocenter of the 2017 Ms 7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake lies between the high and low resistivity bodies at the northeastern, shallowing edge of the HCL. The northern section of the Huya fault corresponds to a deep crustal electrical boundary. The Huya and Tazang faults form a one-sided imbricate fan structure that merges at depth into the HCL. The HCL is deep in the southwestern part of our study area but shallows to the northeast. This observation suggests that northeast movement of the Tibetan Plateau causes tectonic uplift and the frequent occurrence of strong earthquakes in this region.

AB How sedimentary processes, climate, diagenesis, and tectonism influence sediment composition during transport from source to sink remains an outstanding question. To evaluate these mechanisms, we collected more than 11,000 heavy minerals and 800 geochemical data from the Junggar Basin for principal component analysis, and heavy mineral assemblages and instability index studies. Multiple geochemical and mineralogical approaches show climatically influenced changes in weathering for the Middle-Late Triassic sedimentary rocks, while compositions of the Pennsylvanian-Early Triassic sedimentary rocks are mainly provenance-controlled. Moreover, a comparison of the Zr/Sc and Th/Sc ratios, chemical index of alteration and weathering index of Parker, together with relatively high stable heavy mineral contents, indicates that the Middle-Late Triassic sedimentary rocks underwent some sedimentary recycling. The diverse proxies show two pronounced source-to-sink system changes in the Bogda Mountains. During the Lopingian-Early Triassic epochs, the appearance of abundant epidote and high instability index suggest a source shift from the Central Tianshan Block to the North Tianshan Orogenic Belt (NTOB), which is interpreted as two pulses of uplift of the NTOB. The integrated techniques also show that the Bogda Mountains contained much epidote and pyrite with high instability index in the Middle-Late Triassic, while the NTOB piedmont had relatively lower unstable heavy mineral assemblages and instability index. We suggest that this change likely reflects the initial uplift of the Bogda Mountains. Although the upsection sediment composition could be influenced by weathering, sedimentary recycling, and diagenesis, multidisciplinary provenance studies can minimize these uncertainties and biases.

AB The chemical compositions and stable carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions of natural gases in different strata of the Yuanba gas field in the Sichuan Basin were analyzed to investigate their genetic types and source. Natural gases from the Permian Changxing and Triassic Feixianguan formations have dryness coefficients higher than 0.995 and contain H2S in most gas samples, having a positive correlation between the H2S and CO2 contents. The identification of gas origin and gas-source correlation from this study indicate that natural gas in the Ziliujing Formation and most gas samples from the Xujiahe Formation are coal-type gas produced from primary cracking of kerogen, and they are self-sourced reservoirs in relatively independent systems. The natural gases in the 1st and 2nd members of the Xujiahe Formation were mixed with minor amounts of oil-type gas from argillaceous carbonate rocks in the Leikoupo Formation. In addition to the self-accumulated oil-type gas in the Leikoupo Formation, natural gas mainly came from the overlying or lateral source rocks in the Xujiahe Formation. The H2S-bearing natural gases in the Changxing and Feixianguan formations were produced by the cracking of crude oil from source rocks in the underlying Wujiaping Formation, with partial contributions from certain local source rocks in the Permian Dalong Formation. The H2S-bearing natural gas has undergone the thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) which were dominated by heavy hydrocarbons. The high delta C-13 values of CO2 in these gas reservoirs mainly result from the interaction between acidic fluids and carbonate rocks in the reservoirs.

AB Many studies have focused on the tectonic evolution and sedimentary processes of the Beisantai Uplift, NW China during the late Permian. However, the sedimentary characteristics of the area are still not well documented due to a complex tectonic evolution of the uplift and the limited distribution of core data. To understand the sedimentary evolution of this study area, a "source-to-sink" system research is adopted. First, the research redefines the sequence stratigraphic framework of the late Permian, which corresponds to a complete third-order sequence that can be further divided into a transgressive system tract (TST) and a regressive system tract (RST). Then, the integration of three-dimensional (3D) seismic reflection data, well logs, mud logs and core data provides new insights into the transportation and sedimentary processes within the "source-to-sink" system. The different characteristics of the source area, transfer system and sedimentary paleogeomorphology between the TST stage and RST stage ultimately led to significantly different sedimentary characteristics in the two stages.
   In the TST stage, the "source-to-sink" system exhibited a continued transgressive depositional characteristic that matched the sediment discharge evolution. The steeper sedimentary paleogeomorphology enabled the development of large-scale fan deltas with few beach bars. During the RST stage, the "source-to-sink" system had low sediment discharge and a smooth sedimentary paleogeomorphology. The "source-to-sink" system was predominantly characterized by small-scale beach bars with few fan deltas. With the decreasing level of sediment discharge and continued smoothing of the sedimentary paleogeomorphology, the beach bars expanded.

AB The study of the loess deposits is the key for understanding the linkage between dust accumulation, tectonics, landform and climate change. However, little is known about loess accumulation in NE China. Loess deposits at the easternmost edge of the Eurasian loess belt are represented by those in the Xinwopu (XWP), Kulungou (KLG) and Huangshan (HS) sections of NE China. These loess deposits are much coarser than the loess in the southern Chinese Loess Plateau, with a sand (> 63 mu m) content of 6-39% in the loess deposits, and show distinct grain size distribution with a trimodal or bimodal pattern. There are markedly different geochemical compositions between the studied loess deposits: the XWP loess is characterized by the highest content of CaO (9.81%) and MgO (2.06%), and the highest Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.713119); the KLG loess is highlighted by the lowest content of the element Sc (7.68 ppm), V (54.1 ppm), Cr (36.4 ppm), Co (6.32 ppm), Ni (15.6 ppm), Cu (16 ppm), Zn (38.8 ppm), Ga(12.8 ppm) and Sigma REE (113 ppm); the HS loess is of the lowest content of CaO (1.15%), and the highest content of the element Y (84.8 ppm), Zr (242 ppm), Nb (18.1 ppm), Hf (7.2 ppm), Ta (1.45 ppm), Th (12.7 ppm) and Sigma REE (185 ppm); the XWP and KLG loess samples have similar epsilon(Nd)(0) values (-7.9), moderately higher than those (-8.9) of the HS loess. The comparison between various geochemical indicators (e.g., low values of SiO2/Al2O3, Zr/Sc and CIA, and high ICV values) shows that these loess deposits have undergone a different and low degree of chemical weathering with a low maturity and recycling history. Integrated methods including grain size, elemental and isotopic composition, multidimensional scaling as well as physical geographical elements (including the geomorphic and climatic features), clearly revealed the Onqin Daga Sandy Land, the Horqin Sandy Land and the Songnen Sandy Land as main dust provenances of the XWP, KLG and HS loess, respectively.

AB The Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) has important controls on the sedimentation in the Qiadam basin. In this study, detailed sedimentological and geochemical analyses were presented to deduce the impact of the ATF on deposition in the Honggouzi area during the early-middle Miocene, which is a significant period for ATF strike-slip movements. The early-middle Miocene strata of the Honggouzi area are deposits of a fan delta and show retrogradation by sedimentary characteristic of drilled wells. The elementary geochemical analysis indicates that the early-middle Miocene deposits of the Honggouzi area was mainly composed of felsic rocks formed in the continental island arc or active continental margin setting and derived from a segment of the Altyn Tagh Mountains (ATM). In addition, the seismic data suggests that (1) the nearly NW-SE-directed anticlines, which were caused by the flexural deformation, and uplift of the piedmont area in the northwestern Qaidam Basin occurred simultaneously during the early-middle Miocene, and (2) retrogradational sedimentation was caused by greatly increased accommodation during the early-middle Miocene when the subsidence amount of flexural deformation was larger than the uplift amount. The flexural deformation, uplift of the piedmont area of the northwestern basin, and uplift of the ATM were all controlled by the ATF strike-slip movements and therefore were the ways in which the ATF strike-slip movements affected the early-middle Miocene deposition of the Honggouzi area.

AB Drilling cores from the Hangjiahu Coastal plain in the southwestern corner of the Southern Yangtze River deltaic plain, East China, contain a variety of soft-sediment deformation structures in the Late Pleistocene lacustrine and tidal sediments. They include load-flame structures, ball-and-pillow structures, diapir structures, liquefied sand veins, liquefied breccias, syn-sedimentary fault, seismo-cracks and brittle breccias. Sedimentary fades assessment of host deposits and development features rule out an exogenic origin of the soft-sediment deformation structures, such as gravity-flow, storm activity, wave action or flood. These soft-sediment deformation structures in the study area are interpreted as seismites, their spatial distribution suggest that the earthquakes were sourced from the intersection of the Majin-Wuzhen Fault and the Huzhou-Jiashan Fault. Seismites recognized in cores indicate three episodes of short and sudden seismicity (magnitude > 5), which are interpreted as a response to syn-depositional tectonic activity and differential subsidence of the Taihu block during the Late Pleistocene period. Systematic study of spatial and temporal distribution of these seismites improves the understanding of the tectonic context and evolutionary history of sedimentary basement.

AB This paper is primarily a case study on transesterification of avocado oil for the synthesis of biodiesel. Many operational parameters and components were studied in an attempt to identify the optimal process for non catalytic transesterification, and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), an acyl acceptor was identified as key to one very efficient methodology. Non-catalytic transesterification experiments using DMC and/or methanol (Me0H) were conducted under varied temperatures and varied amounts of silica loading. The maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) of 92.96% was shown to be achievable at 380 degrees C. The miscibility of avocado oil and DMC was seen to be a key factor in providing a strategic means for delaying thermal cracking of FAMES. Lastly, this study reported that the optimal mass ratio of silica to oil was over 8 at 380 degrees C.

AB A novel model based on the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was introduced in order to capture the physics of particle-fluid, particle-wall, and colloidal particle-particle interactions through four-way coupling in low-flux nanofluid-based direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs). This was accomplished by means of a computationally efficient particle-particle-interaction detection algorithm implemented within the frame of an in-house fluid-particle coupling algorithm that allowed for the simultaneous evolution of the carrier and particulate phases. The optical, thermal, and dispersion effects of particle-wall and colloidal particle-particle interactions were investigated over a range of particle volume fractions (phi(p)) and flow Reynolds numbers (Re). It was found that the outcome of a particle-wall collision is either particle deposition or rebound, depending on the balance between kinetic energy of the incoming particle and particle-wall van der Waals potential energy. Brownian motion was established to be the main deposition mechanism for nanoparticles in the boundary layer. As Re decreased, Brownian motion of nanoparticles dominated over convection, which led to higher deposition rates. Deposited particles were found to cause greater attenuation of solar radiation near the collector upper surface, especially in the visible region of the solar spectrum. Whereas in the infrared region, radiation attenuation became less sensitive to particle deposition. The drop in collector efficiency when particles are allowed to deposit relative to the case when particles are not allowed to deposit was highest for low Re and phi(p). Yet, regardless of Re, an increase in particle surface potential led to a better dispersion of nanoparticles. Furthermore, colloidal interparticle interactions were found to have a negligible effect on collector performance. The results highlight the important effects of particle deposition and non-uniform particle distribution on the performance of DASC systems, which cannot be captured using conventional single-phase models.

ID SPARK-IGNITION ENGINE; PERFORMANCE
AB Heavy-duty diesel engines can be modified to natural-gas spark-ignition operation by replacing the fuel injector with a spark plug and fumigating the gas inside the intake manifold. As natural gas premixed combustion in a diesel geometry is a two-stage combustion process with each stage influencing engine efficiency and emissions, determining the end of the fast burn inside the bowl can help optimize engine operation. This study proposed a methodology that identifies the burn inside the bowl using the inflection points of the heat release rate. A 3D CFD simulation that changed spark timing, equivalence ratio, and engine speed showed that this methodology can separate the fast combustion stage from the rest of the combustion event compared to the conventional spark-ignition theory that could not. In addition, this methodology showed that operating conditions controlled the flame location and combustion behavior inside the squish. For example, advanced spark timing, higher equivalence ratio, and lower engine speed advanced the transition point between the fast and the slow combustion stages but increased the mass of fuel inside the squish region. Moreover, the flame speed inside the bowl was 3 times higher than that inside the squish region. In addition, the lower burning rate after the transition point can decrease engine efficiency. Moreover, a higher engine speed optimized in-cylinder conditions at the transition between the two combustion events (which would suggest a better late combustion stage) but decreased the time available to complete the late combustion, which will probably increase emissions compared to conventional spark-ignition engines.

AB Vaporizers are the key heat transfer device in the regasification process of liquefied natural gas (LNG), especially for the conventional onshore LNG receiving stations. This paper has proposed a novel intermediate fluid vaporizer by employing multi-stream plate-fin heat exchanger (MPFHE-IFV). Compared to traditional shell-and tube IFVs, it can not only achieve a higher heat transfer efficiency with more compact structure using MPFHE but also realize the recovery and reuse of LNG cold energy with intermediate fluid. In this ingenious design, the self evaporating gas of cryogenic liquid is adopted as the intermediate medium of IFV so that the equipment freezing can be effectively avoided under large flow conditions. A thermal-hydraulic design model has been established for MPFHE-IFV to determine the detailed structural dimensions as well as the heat transfer performance, and a corresponding multi-objective optimization algorithm has been adopted to obtain the minimum equipment volume, the optimal channel arrangement and fin structure, the maximum cold energy recovery efficiency and the optimal number of internal cycles. Meanwhile, the transmission process of the cryogenic exergy in MPFHE-IFV has been revealed according to the analysis of the system temperature-entropy diagram. Finally, two experimental cases based on the liquid nitrogen regasification process are conducted to evaluate the practical performance of the novel MPFHE-IFVs using the design and optimization method proposed in this paper. The results indicate that this new type of IFV can reach the highest cold energy recovery efficiency up to 95% within the 8% error range when the heat transfer capacity is 11.5 kW and the heat medium flow rate is near 330 L/h.

AB Passive latent heat thermal energy storage approach incorporating phase change materials (PCM) is a brilliant technique to tackle high energy consumption issue in buildings. This paper investigated the thermal performance of the conventional walls of buildings in Isfahan, Iran with the inclusion of thirteen different phase change materials. The studied base wall was composed of plaster (2 cm), clay brick (15 cm), and cement (3 cm). The effect of PCM position inside the wall on the heat transfer was assessed in two scenarios, namely: close to the interior and close to exterior. The nonlinear governing equations were solved using the finite volume method. The results show that the performance of PCM-based wall is strongly influenced by the thermal conductivity, phase-change enthalpy and melting temperature of PCM. A PCM can more efficiently reduce the heat transfer to the interior space in case it has a lower thermal conductivity, has a higher latent heat of phase-change, and its phase-change temperature is closer to the room temperature. Moreover, the thermal conductivity has priority over other PCM thermophysical properties. The lower PCM thermal conductivity leads to transfer the lower amount of heat to the interior space. A two-fold increase in the thickness of the PCM leads to less than a twofold reduction in the heat transfer. Among the studied PCMs, the heat transfer reduction by Enerciel 22 was within the range 15.6-47.6%, while this range was 2-7.8% for CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O.

AB The combustion process in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Engines (HCCI) is one of the new methods of futuristic combustion technologies. Since there is no direct operator for the start of the combustion (SOC) of these engines, air-fuel mixture properties at the moment of entering the combustion chamber, specifies the ignition timing. In HCCI engines, the ignition timing is the most crucial factor in determining other engine operating characteristics such as power output, pollution, and fuel consumption. To control SOC, there should be an accurate predictive model based on the entering air-fuel mixture properties. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approach can be considered as a solution with less computational costs than traditional physics-based modeling. In this investigation, a multi-input single-output model was developed for predicting the SOC of the HCCI engine for a wide range of engine operation. Three popular architectures namely the Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARXNET), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) were used, for this purpose. The networks were trained using experimental data taken from a one-cylinder Ricardo engine. The network architecture was optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) method. By using GA, the proposed networks also have the optimum network structures, improved model predictive behaviors, and simulation costs of the learning process. After optimization, the regression ratio between the outputs of MLP and the corresponding experimental data was increased from 0.8965 to 0.96166. This value was improved from 0.7623 to 0.83991 for RBF. By using GA, the time needed to train the NAM( was reduced from 3.12 s to 0.46 s. By comparing the model predictions with the experimental data, it was shown that the selected neural network architectures are powerful approaches for non-linear modeling the SOC of the HCCI engine.

AB This paper proposes two one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting dominant wind speed and direction for the temporal wind dataset. The proposed 1D Single CNN (1DS) takes as input the consecutive temporal values in terms of the wind speed and direction and predicts in future dominating speed and direction, separately, after the last value in the input. The developed 1D Multiple CNN (1DM) combines several 1DS but with different views of the same input, therefore, learning more information compared to the 1DS. The proposed algorithms have been trained and tested using the historical wind datasets of Stuttgart (Germany) and Netherlands for different months. Total accuracies reached up to 95.2%, 95.10/0 for predicting the dominant wind speed and direction, respectively, using the 1DS and up to 98.80/0, 99.7% for predicting the dominant wind speed and direction, respectively, using the 1DM. Unlike other methods which use regression techniques with manually designed features for predicting speed and direction, the proposed methods have used classification techniques with the 1DS and 1DM learning their features automatically on original wind dataset. Further, predicted dominant speed and direction in this work would be helpful in wind turbine installation whose power output depends on above parameters.

AB Accurate online health assessment of fuel cell systems is a key for the timely mitigation and maintenance actions to be taken in order to maximise reliability of operation and useful life span of the cells. The majority of approaches rely on occasional probing of the system with small-amplitude signals around an operating point. The responses are then used to create either a parametric or a non-parametric model of the linearised system dynamics. However, during the probing session, the measurements might be corrupted with random noise and disturbances. Consequently, the evaluated parameters, being points on the impedance curve, parameters of the equivalent circuit models or the distribution of relaxation times, contain some uncertainty. That fact is largely ignored in the state of the art techniques, meaning that only mean value estimates are taken into account in the further analysis. In this paper we use a non-parametric two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to detect a change in the internal condition by evaluating changes at each frequency point on the Nyquist curve. Moreover, we show that in some cases it is even possible to isolate the fault origin from the pattern of detected changes. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated on the detection of water management faults of an industrial proton exchange membrane fuel cell system.

AB Solar-powered hybrid ejection-compression refrigeration system is an important energy-saving technology in space cooling. However, the system is barely reported to be used in multi-storey building and its application in multi-storey building is limited in crowed city, as it requires large area of solar collector because of low thermal efficiency. To fill this research gap, a solar-heat-driven ejector-assisted combined compression (SECC) cycle specially designed for multistory buildings is investigated in this paper. Based on SECC, a cooling system for a 5-storey office building located in Shanghai is designed, optimized and also compared to conventional ejection compression refrigeration cycle (CEC). The overall cooling system using SECC can reduce 203.17 MJ (11.8%) electricity than the cooling system based on CEC, in one day. The effects of building height on system performance is also reported which is seldom found in published references. The cooling system with SECC always consumes less electric energy than the one with CEC, when the building height is larger than 2 floors. It has a best improvement of 21.2% at 3-floor height and has 11.1% good improvement even at 15-floor height, comparing with vapor compression cycle. The results show that SECC has important advantage and is particularly suitable for multi-storey building.

AB For a coal fired power plant, a combined supercritical CO2 cycle (S-CO2) absorbs flue gas energy over entire temperature range. Because top/bottom cycles absorb high and moderate temperature flue gas energy respectively, there is an efficiency gap between the two cycles. To fill the efficiency gap, the overlap absorption of flue gas energy is proposed, using top cycle to absorb high temperature flue gas heat, but bottom cycle to absorb not only moderate temperature flue gas heat, but also a part of high temperature flue gas heat. The overlap energy absorption in a high temperature regime increases CO2 heat absorption temperature to improve bottom cycle efficiency. A four steps roadmap guides us to construct a combined cycle with RC + DRH as top cycle and RC + DRH + EAP as bottom cycle to reach the maximum efficiency limit, where RC, DRH and EAP represent the cycles of recompression, double-reheating and external air preheater, respectively. The components sharing among top/bottom cycles ensures simple system layout, and EAP recycles extra heat of bottom cycle to the system, keeping a smallest heat dissipation to environment. The net power efficiency reaches 47.99% at the main vapor parameters of 620 degrees C/30 MPa. The overlap energy utilization can be extended for other systems.

AB Essentially non-edible banana pseudo-stems (BPS), an abundant agro-waste, can be pyrolytically converted to bioenergy vectors namely; pyro-oil and pyro-gas and a valuable biomaterial, biochar. The study of thermo-chemical behavior of BPS is essential to assess its potentiality as a pyrolysis feedstock. The present article focuses on the studies of the generation of pyro-oil from BPS, enhancement of yield and on the improvement of its fuel quality through a novel biochemical pre-pyrolysis treatment. A semi-defined synergistic microbial consortium comprising baker's yeast and the native fungal sp. of BPS has been utilized in the pretreatment process. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of native and biochemically treated BPS (BBPS) obtained after different pretreatment time (24 h, 36 h and 48 h) has been performed and their lignocellulosic composition has been determined through deconvolution of derivative thermogravimetry (DTG). while DTG analysis indicates overall increase in the fraction of thermally degradable cellulose forms and decrease in lignin content, FTIR analysis confirms decarboxylation of BPS through the increase in biochemical treatment period. The elemental analysis of pyro-oil obtained from BBPS-48 indicates gradual decrease in oxygen content as the pretreatment time is increased. At the pyrolysis temperature of 773 K, the maximum yield (53.54% (w/w)) of pyro-oil from 48 h bio-pretreated BPS (BBPS-48) is two-fold higher than that obtained from native BPS (24.5%), the oxygen contents of the former and latter being 53.75% and 64.1%, respectively. This effectively leads to almost two fold increase in higher heating value (HHV), of pyro-oil from BBPS-48 (12.97 MJ/kg) in comparison to its BPS counterpart (7.77 MJ/kg). The overall increase in yield and quality of pyro-oil due to bio-pretreatment has been explained in the article.

AB The paper presents a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the cold alpha-type Stirling engine. The developed mathematical model comprises of Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) set of equations, i.e. continuity, momentum and energy equations. Moreover, the developed mathematical model comprises a non-equilibrium description of the regenerator, by the introduction of the energy conservation equation for the regenerator matrix. It was implemented in the framework of commercial CFD software ANSYS Fluent. The work presents an in-depth analysis of the influence of the numerical mesh and applied turbulence model on the obtained results. The model was used to analyse the influence of the regenerator on the performance of the cold Stirling engine at different operating conditions. It appeared that on an average application of the regenerator increased the engine specific work by 10 J/kg and this increase is significantly higher at a high rotational speed of the engine. At the same time, the engine efficiency averagely was increased by 10 percent points and again this increase was significantly higher at higher rotational speeds of the engine. Especially, the influence of the heat source and sink temperatures on the engine operation were analysed. It appears that the lower are temperatures of a heat source and sink the more pronounced is the presence of the regenerator in the engine. Finally, the influence of the elementary parameters: particle diameter and porosity of the solid matrix which constitute the regenerator filling was investigated. It was shown that for the analysed engine the optimal value of the regenerator packing porosity equals about 0.72 it results in the specific area of the regenerator equal around 1675 m(2)/m(3). Obtained results can be used to analyse the possibility of application of Stirling engines to recover low-temperature exergy of regasified Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), which for small regasification units can be alternative for commonly utilised Ambient Air Vaporizers (AAV) and it aside for regasification of LNG it could produce electric energy.

AB Analytical and numerical solutions were developed to assess the effects of introducing a nanofluid for optical filtration (OF) above the PV module and a layer of a nano-enhanced phase change material (nanoPCM) below the PV panel, on the overall performance of a photovoltaic-thermal solar collector. The analytical study employed six models (M1-M6) with different arrangements of the cooling channel, optical filtration channel, nanoPCM and the number of optical filtration passes. The optical fluid demonstrated an enhancement in the performance by cooling the PV module by convection beside the optical filtration effect. A numerical study was undertaken to distinguish the effects of the optical fluid in enhancing the performance of the photovoltaic thermal system. The numerical study employed three extra models (N1-N3), which use cooling and optical filtration only. The optical filtration fluid channel and the PV module are separated by an airgap in N-1, while in N-2 the optical filtration channel is directly above the PV module. Optical filtration is not used in N-3. The effect of the channel height, nanoparticle concentration, and mass flow rate on the performance was evaluated. The analytical results show that the use only of a nanoPCM decreases the overall efficiency (thermal + electrical) by about 6.7% (neglecting the storage effects of the nanoPCM). However, the introduction of optical filtration makes the decrease in efficiency very small ( < 1%). Moreover, using the optical filtration alone improves the overall efficiency by 6-12%. The thermal performance can be improved if the optical fluid channel and the PV panel are separated by an airgap. However, this may reduce the electrical efficiency.

AB In district heating, conventional flue gas heat recovery systems do not perform well anymore when the return water temperature is high. In this paper, a hybrid heat recovery system based on vapor compression refrigeration and liquid desiccant dehumidification is then proposed, with proper refrigerants and desiccants recommended. A simulation model of this system is established and a typical case is studied based on the model with a return water temperature of 60 degrees C. Then, an equivalent thermal efficiency is introduced to evaluate the system performance. Parametric analyses are conducted by changing the liquid-gas flowrate ratio and the inlet solution temperature in the second stage of the absorber in the system. According to the parametric analyses, a liquid-gas mass flowrate ratio of 3.2-3.4 and an inlet solution temperature of 45 degrees C are recommended as the best working conditions considering the economic and ecological effects. Under these conditions, the equivalent thermal efficiency of a boiler can be increased from 90% to 104%. For a boiler with a rated heating capacity of 7 MW, about CNY 236,000 (USD 34,000) can be saved per month. Besides, the flue gas is finally discharged at a relative humidity of only 33%. The formation of white smoke can thus be avoided and the contaminant attachment in the atmosphere around can be alleviated. The proposed system is efficient and environmentally friendly and the simulation results can offer references to real applications under variable working conditions.

AB Technical challenges facing the development of battery economic charging for energy management arise from various contradictory objectives, immeasurable internal states, and hard constraints. Available solutions often resort to optimizing economic charging from the perspective of power grid, while few focus on the benefits of electric vehicle (EV) owners. This paper proposes a constrained multi-objective optimization framework to achieve economy-conscious battery charging management. Specifically, a coupled electrothermal-aging model is first applied to capture the nonlinear electrical, thermal, and aging dynamics of a lithium-ion battery with different timescales. Then an economic indicator considering the total charging cost caused by both the battery aging and electrical energy loss is formulated, based on a battery resale cost model and the Beijing peak-valley time-of-use (TOU) price. In addition, two crucial but contradictory objectives including the charging time and battery average temperature are also taken into account, along with hard constraints on the battery State of Charge (SOC), charging current, terminal voltage, and temperature. The complicated multi-objective charging problem is solved by using NSGA-II to optimize the multistage constant-current (MCC) profile. Sensitivities of the cut-off voltage, convection resistance, and ambient temperature are comparatively analysed via Pareto frontier. Numerical results of two extreme cases and several balanced charging cases demonstrate that feasible, economy conscious battery charging management for various user demands can be achieved through suitable equilibrations among charging speed and thermal variations during charging.

AB Accurate short-term wind power forecasting is significant for rational dispatching of the power grid and ensuring the power supply quality. In order to enhance the accuracy of short-term wind speed prediction, a hybrid model based on VMD-WT and PCA-BP-RBF neural network is proposed. In data pre-processing period, the non-stationary wind speed sequence is decomposed into a number of relatively stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by variational mode decomposition (VMD); then WT algorithm is used to perform secondary denoising on each IMF. At the same time, several factors affecting wind speed are introduced, from which the input features that participated in the prediction are selected by PCA-BP method. Next, the RBF neural network is utilized to predict each IMF. Finally, all IMF prediction results are aggregated to obtain the final wind speed value. Combining the data of Spanish and Chinese wind farms, the experiment results show that: (1) compared with EMD, VMD-WT can better solve the problems of modal aliasing and endpoint effect, which can make the periodic characteristics of each IMF more obvious, then promote the forecasting performance; (2) using PCA-BP method to filter the model input data, the redundant and irrelevant information is eliminated, the complexity of the model is reduced, and the predictive performance of RBF model is improved; (3) compared with other traditional models, the hybrid model proposed in this paper has greatly improved the accuracy in short-term wind speed forecasting.

AB The optimization of a gas power cycle can be thermodynamical, techno-economical, thermo-economical and so on but, in general, the thermodynamic modeling is mandatory to solve the problem. Once the thermodynamic model is established the properties of the gases present in the cycle must be evaluated and the simplifications made for this evaluation could lead to inaccurate and even misleading results. In this paper the effect of using the perfect gas model in the optimization of the Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) of the open simple cycle gas turbine has been analyzed. The results are obtained for compressor and turbine inlet temperatures (CIT and TIT) between 260 K-320 K and 1200 K-1800 K respectively. The optimization yields the minimum of SFC but also the corresponding values of compressor pressure ratio and specific power. In this work the optimization is first performed with a highly accurate ideal gas modeling approach in order to generate benchmark results. Afterward, the optimization is performed with a perfect gas modeling approach using four different methods (named A, B, C and D) to evaluate the constant value needed of the isobaric heat capacity. It is found that the optimization results can depend strongly on the method or rule used to evaluate the heat capacity. As an example, the uncertainty in the optimal value of SFC is between 8.5% and 14.9% with method C and below 3.2% with method D. In general, huge deviations in the compressor pressure ratio are found. Values higher than 160/0 for CIT below 300 K regardless the TIT value are found with methods A, B and C. In the worst case this deviation can be even higher than 100%. In general, this uncertainty gives rise to higher deviations in the specific power than in optimal SFC values. For example, with the method B and a TIT of 1800 K the ranges of the relative error are 56%-112%, 4.9%-6.2% and 17.8%-26.7% in the compressor pressure ratio, optimal SFC and specific power respectively. With respect to the CIT and TIT dependence the deviations in the compressor pressure ratio and specific power increase for high TIT and low CIT.

AB A novel configuration of a hybrid binary geothermal biomass power plant is proposed that generates electricity through the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), which receives the thermal power provided by a biomass heat source through intermediate geothermal fluid. The plants are located in regions with extreme environmental conditions where water is not available, making the use of air-cooled condensers in the ORC necessary, and the seasonal variations of the ambient air temperature are remarkable. As a further novel aspect, the modification of the biomass mass flow rate is used to overcome the simultaneous harmful effects of a considerable reduction in the geothermal fluid temperature during the operative life of the plant and the more significant seasonal change of the ambient air temperature. Our original approach involves developing a simulation model of the proposed plant using the commercial software Aspen (R) to determine the energy performance in off-design conditions, i.e., in the presence of the simultaneous changes of the biomass flow rate, ambient air temperature and geothermal fluid temperature. The biomass flow rate is controlled to maximize the net electric power or net thermodynamic efficiency of the plant with varying ambient air and geothermal fluid temperatures. In comparison to the first operating mode, the second enables a saving of the biomass used annually in the range of 28.3%-42.6%, corresponding to the maximum and minimum geothermal fluid temperature, respectively, with the resulting detrimental effect on the yearly produced electric energy in the range of 90/0-23.6%.

AB Absorption-compression heat pumps are especially suitable for high-temperature heat production, however, its performance at different conditions are highly influenced by the choice of ammonia-rich solution mass fraction and circulation ratio. This paper revealed the working domains of a hybrid absorption-compression heat pump for high-temperature ( > 130 degrees C) saturated steam production and obtained its optimized thermodynamic performance at different conditions. For saturated steam production, a supplied heat temperature up to 160 degrees C can be obtained using commercially available components with a thermal benefit compared to a gas boiler. For hot water or air production, the supplied temperature can be even higher. Moreover, a new heat coefficient of performance is proposed to evaluate the heat pump systems with both heat and power consumption. There are optimal heat coefficient of performance values for the circulation ratio and ammonia-rich solution mass fraction for the hybrid system. The results indicated that setting the ammonia-rich solution mass fraction less than 0.6 and the circulation ratio more than 0.7 is a better choice for the hybrid system in actual application. Finally, the hybrid heat pump system was used to improve the thermal performance of a saturated steam and power co-generation system driven by an internal combustion engine. This work provides a useful guidance for the hybrid absorption-compression heat pump in actual application.

AB The majority of existing commercial thermoelectric modules have fixed geometry, with customers purchasing those modules without adjusting its geometry for a specific application. However, previous investigations show that thermoelectric module geometry can have a significant influence on its output power careful design considerations are therefore required. In this study, both simulation and experimental investigations are conducted to optimize the geometry of thermoelectric modules, in order to achieve higher power while maintaining the cost low. The experimental setup is built, and three thermoelectric modules with different geometries but same material are tested. The documented experimental results agree well with the simulation results. Based on parametric studies, optimal thermoelectric module height to achieve maximum output power is found to be 1.1 min at the given thermal condition, slightly lower compared with the value used for most commercial products, which are around 1.5 mm. The effect of geometry design parameters on efficiency and power per material cost are also discussed, and the optimal design parameters are identified. Further improvements are proposed based on the simulation and experimental results.

AB The main objective of this investigation is to introduce an economic and feasible hybrid energy system to provide the required load for a household in Rayen, Iran. The case study is a building with 20 families. The power consumption of a family at a peak is considered by 4 kW. So, this combined system must provide a power of 80 kW. First a hybrid organic Rankine cycle is proposed and assessed by exergy and exergoeconomic methods. The results of exergy analysis indicate the overall exergy efficiency of the system is 7.29%. As well as, the greatest exergy destruction is related to the photovoltaic panels with a value of 337.16 kJ. The outcomes of the exergoeconomic assessment showed that, the highest and lowest capital investment cost rate belong to the photovoltaic panels (54233 $/year) and condenser (7092 $/year), respectively. Also, the product cost rate is calculated by 5.2 million $/year. In continue, to identify the key parameters which influence on the total performance of the ORC system, a parametric analysis is done. Because of the hybrid organic Rankine cycle has a high amount of the cost of energy, seven renewable hybrid energy systems are proposed and modeled by HOMER software. The results show the optimum energy system for this residential area is the hybrid PV - wind-diesel - battery. This configuration has a net positive cost of 268,592 $ and a cost of energy of 0.197 $/lcWh. At the end of this study, to find the impact of the variations of the fuel cost and peak load on system performance, a parametric analysis was carried out.

AB Oxygen carriers (OCs) determined the performance of biomass chemical looping gasification (CLG). This work focused on the potential effects of Mg/Al/Zn oxides on the CLG reactivity of brownmilerite-type Ca2Fe2O5, and the interactions between them were studied. The results showed Al oxide was unsuitable as support for Ca2Fe2O5, because it broke the crystalline structure of Ca2Fe2O5 and weakened the syngas selectivity in CLG. ZnO could enhance the syngas production property, but reduced into metal Zn, thus was also unacceptable to be added into Ca2Fe2O5. MgO addition enhanced the oxygen release capacity of Ca2Fe2O5, and the TGA and fixed bed tests showed the improvement in biomass CLG performance. MgO also provided a solvent for the reduced OC, which would raise its melting temperature by the dissolution, thus enhance the OC ability in multiple redox reactions. The 10 redox times test also showed the prepared MgO/Ca2Fe2O5 could almost kept stable reactivity. The study also provided a strategy for designing other redox materials operated in high temperature, like chemical looping or calcium looping.

AB The objective of this paper is to investigate comprehensively energy, exergy and financial parametric analyses of a solar flat plate collector (FPC) using heat pipes. A validated 1-D mathematical model was established and implemented in MATLAB to assess the collector performance. Hourly meteorological variables for one complete year in Fez (Morocco) were fitted and incorporated into the computation tool to describe accurately the thermal behavior of the whole collector. The combined effects of various climatic data, operating and design parameters were analyzed energetically and exergetically based on hourly and monthly performance indexes. Multi-objective optimization using a dimensionless-geometrical index was practiced to find out the best operating scenario achieving the highest energy and exergy outputs at a reduced cost. The best compromise between thermal/exergy performances was obtained at 986.93 W/m(2) for the incident solar radiation, 12.18 degrees C for the ambient temperature and 1.50 m/s for the wind velocity. Also, it was found that the best combination of operating conditions is 45 degrees C inlet temperature and 0.036 kg/s mass flow rate. Fixing the number of heat pipes to 13 leads to an optimized collector design in terms of energetic, exergetic and financial performances. The obtained results confirm that an appropriate design of the collector should be undertaken carefully depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions to achieve optimum energetic/exergetic and economic performances.

AB Three oxy-fuel IGCC power plants using different air separation technologies and carbon compression and compression (CCP) are developed to near-zero CO2 emission power systems. If capturing CO2 is treated as a byproduct, Design 2 by an integration of IGCC and natural gas-fueled integrated intermittent chemical looping air separation (NG-IICLAS) may have a promising economic potential. Through the techno-economic assessment of Design 2, its internal rate of return (IRR) by 17.99% is higher than a chemical looping combustion (CLC)-based IGCC power plant connecting carbon capture and storage (CCS) with IRR = 12.5%, its levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by 69.92 (sic)/MWh is close to the LCOE of supercritical coal-fired power plant in 2015, and its CO2 production cost by 12.35 (sic)/ton is also close to the market price for CO2 in 2011. It is successfully verified that the investing in Design 2 is superior to other designs.

AB This paper presents a thermochemical and experimental investigation into the use of oxy-fuel exhaust gases for the tri-reforming of light oil. The thermochemical recuperation of light oil makes it possible for the furnace to burn hydrogen-rich syngas, and thereby significantly improve furnace efficiency. This study investigates three process parameters: the exhaust gas recirculation rate, the syngas temperature, and the exhaust gas temperature. (1) The more exhaust gas that is recirculated, the less oxygen is required for complete conversion into syngas, and the higher the heating value of the produced syngas. A maximum increase in the heating value of 31.6% (compared to the primary fuel) is possible if pure bi-reforming is performed. (2) The chemical equilibrium calculations showed that the syngas temperature has a strong effect on the composition of the syngas; a syngas temperature of 1265 degrees C is necessary to achieve a conversion rate of 99.9%. The thermodynamic analysis was performed using the Gibbs free energy minimization method. In order to prevent carbon formation, a slight oxygen excess of 1% must be present. In this case, a syngas temperature of 970 degrees C is sufficient for the stationary tri-reforming of light oil. (3) The energy required for reforming the primary fuel increases with increased syngas temperature, while the energy contained in the hot exhaust gas stream increases with increased exhaust gas temperature. In order to achieve a syngas temperature of at least 970 degrees C, both the required exhaust gas recirculation rate and the amount of oxygen for reforming and combustion are directly dependent on the temperature of the exhaust gas. An exhaust gas temperature of 1000 degrees C requires an exhaust gas recirculation rate of 16.2%, while a recirculation rate of 26.9% is necessary at an exhaust gas temperature of 1600 degrees C. In the latter case, it is possible to increase the efficiency of the oxy-fuel furnace by 22.8%.

AB In this research, energy level based exergoeconomic evaluations are performed for a novel biomass and natural gas fired polygeneration system of electricity, hot water, chilled water and hydrogen production. The proposed system mainly consists of a biomass gasifier, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, a gas turbine cycle (GT), an absorption chiller, and a ground source heat pump cycle. Conventional and energy level based exergoeconomic performances of the proposed system are compared; related exergy and economic analysis are also performed. In addition, the variations in unit exergy cost of products (electricity, hot water, chilled water and hydrogen) are studied under economic factors. The results show that energy and exergy efficiency of the electrolyzer and the proposed system decrease with the increasing current density of the PEM electrolyzer. The unit exergy cost of electricity and hydrogen are 5.24 $/GJ and 20.41 $/GJ under the energy level based exergoeconomic method, respectively, which are higher than that under the conventional exergoeconomic method (electricity: 4.38 $/GJ, hydrogen: 19.00 $/GJ), while the unit exergy cost of hot water and chilled water under the energy level based exergoeconomic method are lower than that under the conventional exergoeconomic method. Moreover, the exergoeconomic factor and relative cost difference of the system equipment also show distinctions under the conventional and energy level based exergoeconomic methods. The presented poly generation system is a promising technology to utilize renewable energy and improve the flexibility of the integrated system; and the energy level based exergoeconomic method shows certain rationality and feasibility in the system analysis.

AB Recent developments in renewable energy have highlighted the need for rational use of wind energy. Accurate prediction of wind speed and wind power is recognized as an essential part in realizing energy balance and scheduling decisions of power generation. In recent years, various wind energy forecasting models have been successfully proposed. Among them, intelligent models occupy an irreplaceable dominance and have tremendous potential due to their accuracy and robustness. This paper gives a broad literature survey of the intelligent predictors in the field of wind energy forecasting, including four types of shallow predictors (artificial neural network, extreme learning machine, support vector machine, and fuzzy logic model) and four types of deep learning-based predictors (autoencoder, restricted Boltzmann machine, convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network). Their theoretical backgrounds, applications, merits, and limitations are thoroughly discussed. Then, two commonly used auxiliary methods for hybrid intelligent models are reviewed, i.e., ensemble learning and metaheuristic optimization. The ensemble learning models are categorized by the sources of diversity and ensemble strategies. According to the specific optimized objects, the metaheuristic optimization algorithms are classified into two groups. Moreover, the general process of metaheuristic optimization and differences between single-objective and multi-objective algorithms are also clarified. A group of representative models is summarized to show the frameworks of mainstream predictive models in artificial intelligence. Finally, this paper gives three possible development directions of wind energy forecasting for subsequent research.

AB The increased amounts of manure have become an issue of environmental management due to the rapid growth of livestock industry. This study quantified the pyrolytic performance and gaseous products of cattle manure using (derivative) thermogravimetric ((D)TG), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analyses. The pyrolysis process of cattle manure was determined to occur in three stages, with the main reaction in the range of 161-600 degrees C. The N-2 atmosphere was found to be more favorable for the release of volatiles according to a higher comprehensive pyrolysis index in the range of 30 - 600 degrees C. The lower activation energies were shown to be required in the CO2 than N-2 atmosphere. Random forests algorithm outperformed multiple linear regression, gradient boosting machine, and artificial neural networks for the prediction of mass loss due to the cattle manure pyrolysis. The main gaseous products were CO2, phenol (23.23%), and furans (12.98%). The theoretical and practical guidance for the energy and resource utilization of cattle manure was provided by this study.

AB Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) remains a contemporary research interest due to its promising merits in the field of thermal management of various engineering applications. Thermal performance of a PHP is greatly influenced by various operating parameters. Heat input is one of the significant parameters that alter the intricate two-phase flow physics in a PHP. The present research is aimed to explore channel wise intricate thereto-hydrodynamic characteristics as a function of heat input (10 W-200 VV) and its influence on the thermal performance of nine-turn acetone charged Closed Loop PHP (CLPHP). Filling Ratio (FR) is kept as 50% and vertical bottom heating position is considered. Flow visualization is carried out using a high-speed camera (Photron FASTCAM Mini UX100) and images are processed on Photron FASTCAM Analysis (PFA ver. 1.2.0.0) software. Flow patterns, shape of meniscus, liquid-vapor volume fraction, circulating/oscillating characteristic based on channel wise bubble displacement and velocity-frequency distribution are investigated. Synchronization of hydrodynamic characteristics with thermal performance parameters is performed. Multiple steady-states and recovery zone are identified and analyzed. A flow pattern transition criterion based on velocity is proposed. The trend of displacement-velocity-frequency with heat input is developed. The present quantified analysis will be helpful to design and develop CLPHP based engineering applications.

AB Low-temperature pyrolysis is one of the most promising methods for lignite upgrading and staged utilization, however, its effect on particulate matter emissions from the combustion of upgrad lignite has not been reported before. In this paper, Xilin Gol lignite was pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed reactor at 250-550 degrees C, the produced semi char was characterized, and then burned in a drop tube furnace at 1300 degrees C. Particulate matter emissions from lignite semi-char combustion are collected and measured passing through a 13-stage impactor. Results show that the particulate matter emissions of lignite combustion can be significantly affected through the change of fuel properties by low-temperature pyrolysis upgrading. In the studied pyrolysis temperature range, the most drastic devolatilization, fragmentation, porous structure development, and removal of reactive functional group occur at about 350 degrees C, when the produced semi-char has the highest combustion reactivity. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, both emissions of particulate matter < 0.5 mu m and particulate matter in the range of 0.5-10 mu m first decrease and then increase. Pyrolysis upgrading significantly reduces the emissions of particulate matter < 0.5 mu m from lignite combustion, and the combustion of semi-char produced at 350 degrees C has the lowest emissions of particulate matter < 0.5 mu m. The lowest emissions of particulate matter in the range of 0.5-10 mu m are obtained from the combustion of semi-char produced at 250 degrees C. In particulate matter emissions from semi char combustion, the ultrafine particles < 100 nm are rich in sulfur, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus and ferrum while the coarse ones are rich in silicon and aluminum. The influencing mechanism of pyrolysis temperature on particulate matter emissions is complicated and includes many factors, requiring further study. This study indicates that low-temperature pyrolysis upgrading is efficient to control particulate matter emissions from lignite combustion.

AB Solar-derived industrial process heat could be harvested from the rooftops of factories around the world, but stakeholders must make some choices about which solar technologies to install (of those available on the market) to find the 'best' fit to local conditions. For industrial process heat, solar thermal (ST) collectors can generate medium temperature thermal energy directly, but solar photovoltaics (PV) can also be used-indirectly-to generate the same thermodynamic quality via resistance heating or a heat pump. To systematically investigate this solar dilemma, options ranging from 100% PV to 100% ST were considered in this study in the context of several objective functions to determine the 'best' technological mix. The objectives functions-economic (levelized cost of energy), technical (overall performance) and environmental (embodied emissions)-were applied individually and collectively, as multi-objective optimizations, to gain insights into how each might impact the optimum mix of solar technologies. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to explore the impact of our assumptions (design and costs) on the optimal system design. The results reveal the optimum solar mix between the various objectives varies significantly in the 12 characteristics global locations considered in this study and that the capacity factor varies between (8-45)%. Generally, it was found that a mix of technologies (not solely PV or ST) in a side-by-side configuration improves performance, the levelized cost of energy, and the environmental payback time (by up to 35%, 9.8%, 16%, respectively, when compared to ST alone, and by up to 21%, 16.1%, 11.8%, respectively, when compared to PV alone). Overall, the approach and the results of this study can be used as a guideline for architects, engineers, and decision makers to help decide the best mix of solar technologies for industrial process heat applications based on their objective(s).

AB Non-equilibrium plasma technology provides an unconventional but promising solution for the cleaning of tar contaminated bio-syngas in biomass gasification. This work is focused on the reforming of mixed naphthalene (C10H8) and toluene (C7H8) as typical single ring and double ring tar model components using a gliding arc discharge (GAD) reactor. The influence of naphthalene content, steam/carbon molar ratio and discharge power on the destruction of C10H8 and C7H8 was evaluated to understand their effects on the tar conversion, gas yield, and the energy consumption. Adding H2O to the plasma process forms OH radicals, creating additional reaction routes for the step-wised oxidation of naphthalene, toluene and their fragments towards the production of CO, CO2, and water. The highest conversion of naphthalene and toluene (similar to 80% overall) was obtained when the steam/carbon molar ratio changed between 1.0 and 1.5, which was dependent on the balance between two opposite effects due to the presence of steam: positive effect of OH radicals and negative effect of electron attachment on water molecules. The highest energy efficiency (53.6 g/kWh) was obtained for the conversion of mixed tar compounds, which is by far the highest in previously reported works. CO, H-2 and C2H2 were the major gases with the highest CO yield of 38.6% and H-2 yield of 39.1%. Emission spectroscopic diagnostics was employed to understand the contribution of chemically reactive species to the GAD reaction. Possible reaction pathways in the plasma reforming of mixed naphthalene and toluene were proposed based on the plasma spectroscopic diagnostics coupled with a comprehensive analysis of major gas products and condensable by-products.

AB A new integrated cycle based on different real temperatures and pressures on Sabalan geothermal power plant, located in Iran, has been proposed and thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses are performed. The Kalina and Transcritical Rankine cycles are used as bottoming cycles and an algorithm are applied to find the exact location of the pinch points in heat exchangers. Also, a parametric study carried out to reveal the effects on the thermodynamic and exergoeconomic performance of the integrated cycle of such important parameters as separator 1 pressure, separator 2 pressure, pinch point temperature difference in the evaporators, higher pressure of the Kalina cycle and the ratio of the Transcritical cycle higher pressure to the critical pressure. Finally, the proposed cycle performance is optimized from the thermodynamic and exergoeconomic viewpoints. The results show that for the integrated geothermal power plant, the power generation, thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency and power specific cost rate are calculated to be 19,448 kW, 16.63%, 63.78%, and 4.521 $/GJ, respectively, which indicate that the proposed cycle has improved thermodynamically and exergoeconomically compared to previous studies.

AB The loop thermosyphon with active heat transfer control capability is a promising solution for the temperature management of the fresh food compartment of cool-storage refrigerators or other precise temperature control devices. However, the frequently start-stop operating mode of the loop thermosyphon has not received enough attention, its active temperature management behaviours still requires further investigation. In this study, a controllable loop thermosyphon used in the temperature control of a fresh food compartment is developed and its start-stop is controlled by the temperature controller with the assistance of two magnetic valves. The performances of the controllable loop thermosyphon in long-term and start-stop operating modes are tested. The controllable loop thermosyphon with 35% filling ratio present highest heat transfer rate, reliable heat transfer capability, and good stability for the varying temperatures in the fresh food compartment. Based on this filling ratio, the heat transfer rate remains higher than 40 W during the long-term operating test. When the controllable loop thermosyphon operates in the start-stop mode, the start-stop cycle decreases from 39.4 min to 27.2 min and the operating ratio increases from 12.6% to 53.7% as the temperature of the fresh food compartment rises. Particularly, when the start-stop cycle reduces from 42.6 min to 18.1 min, the temperature control accuracy is improved from 2.0 degrees C to 0.4 degrees C. The results demonstrate that the controllable loop thermosyphon is promising as a novel precise temperature management device and is qualified for the use in cool-storage refrigerators.

AB The present work investigated the potential of acidogenesis digestate rich in volatile fatty acids (Bio-D-Acid) and methanogenesis digestate rich in ammonia (Bio-D-Meth) as a green method for the pretreatment of rice straw and biomethane production. After pretreatment with Bio-D-Meth for 48 h, a maximum hemicellulose reduction of 22.4% was recorded, while 48 h of Bio-D-Acid showed the lowest reduction of 15.7%. In addition, pretreatment for 48 h with Bio-D-Meth and Bio-D-Acid showed significant removal of lignin by 16.6 and 11.0%, respectively. SEM and FTIR confirmed major increase in straw porosity and degradation after all applied pretreatments. The highest significant biomethane content of 71.2% was recorded in 24 h Bio-D-Acid-pretreated straw. However, the highest significant yield of 249.1 L kg(-1) VS was recorded from the 48 h Bio-D-Meth-pretreated straw, which was 9.8, 19.6, and 27.0% higher than 24 h Bio-D-Meth-, 24 h Bio-D-Acid and 48 h Bio-D-Meth-treated straw, respectively. Importantly, pretreatment with Bio-D-Meth for 24 h showed the highest estimated net bioenergy output of 7.37 GJ ton(-1) dry straw, which represented 28.6 and 0.13% increase over that of the control and 48 h Bio-D-Meth-pretreated straw, respectively. The present study suggested application of Bio-D-Meth for 24 h as an efficient eco-friendly pretreatment method for efficient AD of rice straw.

AB The energy conversion performance of oscillating water column (OWC) wave energy converters at a specific site is often studied by means of analytical models. Based on linear theory, these models lose accuracy when viscous losses and turbulence become significant-more generally, when nonlinear effects play a role, as they often do in real operating conditions. In this work we apply a novel methodology based on a combination of numerical modelling and laboratory tests to investigate OWC performance without these shortcomings. First, high-resolution wave resource characterisation matrices are obtained by means of numerical modelling. Second, the resource matrices are combined with the OWC efficiency matrices obtained through laboratory tests and, importantly, including the effects of turbine-induced damping and air compressibility usually disregarded in small-scale laboratory tests, but relevant for full-size (prototype) devices. The combined matrices thus obtained express, through a wave height-period distribution, the energy captured by the OWC for different values of the damping coefficient. On this basis, developers can select the most appropriate value of turbine-induced damping for a given site, based on performance values. The implementation of the novel methodology is illustrated through a case study in Galicia (NW Spain), in which three deployment sites are considered. We find that the turbine-induced damping must be matched to the wave climate of the site for an OWC device to achieve high performance; indeed, changes in damping cause variations in the total annual energy captured of up to 11%, which increase to 25% for specific sea states.

AB Defects at the leading edge of blades are an important source of power loss for wind turbines. In the present work, a systematic study is carried out on two typical types of defects, i.e., the surface concaved deep defects and surface distributed shallow defects on the 5809 airfoil. Different defect shapes, ranges, equivalent depths and their influence mechanisms are investigated via CFD. For deep defects, an enclosed vortex is formed in the defect cavity, which suppresses the momentum exchange between the external flow and internal flow, so that the airfoil aerodynamic performance is highly sensitive to the defect opening range and is little affected by the defect shape and equivalent depth. Flow around the leading edge is strongly hindered by the deep defects and an elongated leading-edge separation bubble is formed at the suction side of the airfoil. At large angles of attack, flow at the suction side is dominated by flow separation at both the leading edge and trailing edge. In contrast, for shallow defects, all the defect equivalent depth, opening range and shape can significantly influence the airfoil aerodynamic performance; and quantitatively, the effect of defect equivalent depth is the most significant. For the present simulation cases with defects, the maximum lift coefficient is notably decreased (by 35% to 61%) accompanied by a sharp increase in drag coefficient (by 131% to 217%). Under dynamic pitching motions, the opening of the dynamic lift (drag)-coefficient hysteresis curve is effectively enlarged. The present work aims to provide an important reference for the maintenance and management of turbine blade defects.

AB A biomass-based magnetic catalyst was synthesised by way of a chemical activation-doping-sulphonation process using empty fruit bunch (EFB) char as a precursor for conversion of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) to biodiesel. The magnetic heterogeneous acid catalyst AC-Fe-(x)-SO3Cl, with x = 2, 5, 10 and 15 (%) was prepared, to synthesise the optimised magnetic catalyst. The optimised magnetic catalyst was identified by applying TPD-NH3, BET, XRD, XPS, VSM, TGA and FESEM. The prepared magnetic catalyst had a higher surface area (20.42 m(2)/g), high acidity (29,520 mu mol/g), and high magnetic properties (HC = 344.14G). The esterification activity of the AC-Fe-(10)-SO3Cl catalyst showed high free fatty acid conversion (98.6%) with optimal reaction conditions of 4 wt % catalyst, 3 h reaction time, 16:1 methanol/PFAD ratio and 100 degrees C reaction temperature. In addition, AC-Fe-(10)-SO3Cl showed the capability of maintaining esterification activity for six continuous cycles with no further treatment and gave a similar to 79% biodiesel conversion. The produced catalysts showed characteristics such as high durability during esterification, with metal leaching containing low activity after several cycles. The EFB waste-based acidic magnetic catalysts are potentially efficient, economical, and eco-friendly for the esterification of waste oils and fats for biodiesel production.

AB In this study, a geothermal power plant endowed with actual operational conditions and its equipment are evaluated using exergoenvironmental analysis from the perspective of environmental impact. Environmental impacts related to equipment (including construction, operation/maintenance and disposal), exergy destruction and pollution formation are taken into consideration. Moreover, effects of ambient temperature and brine input temperature with respect to environmental impact factors of the system are also discussed. Though this analysis, relative difference of specific environmental impacts, exergoenvironmental factor and total environmental impact are determined as 122% and 2.5% and 2285 Pts/h, respectively. The results of the study show that 98% of total environmental impact for the geothermal power plant is the cause of exergy destruction of the equipment involved. For this reason, improvement of exergetic efficiency for equipment should be considered rather than construction, operation/maintenance and disposal changes of system equipment. Hence, it is probably possible to have a higher capacity plant by getting a better condenser performance, as well as strengthening the vaporizers and the pumps. Besides, approximately 44 Pts/h of non-condensable gas-NCG (CO2 mostly) released from vaporizer to atmosphere caused environmental impact of the system to be measured as high environmental impact value of electricity equal to 0.108 Pts/kWh. In conclusion, conditions during which the ambient temperature decreases and brine input temperature increases, the system's environmental impacts concurrently decrease. This study is expected to serve as a guidework for researchers involved in environmental impacts of geothermal power plants and improvement of the plants in terms of environmental impact.

AB A heat recovery system is employed for power generation from a PEM fuel cell's waste heat. The proposed system involves the parallel organic Rankine cycle for utilizing the provided heat and hydrogen boil-off gas (BOG) stream as a heat sink for the cycle. Also, this stream generates power by using an expander and prepares some chilled water that enhances system performance. The PEM fuel cell as the major component of the system is modeled and then the parallel two-stage ORC (PTORC) and BOG streams are analyzed in points of the energy and exergy view. Exergoeconomic concept is applied to evaluate the economic view of the system besides energy and exergy analyses. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed by system key parameters which provided some valuable information to comprehend the performance of the overall system. The results show that the proposed system can generate 1353 kW power. Exergoeconomic factor, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the overall system are computed to be 26.21%, 58.15%, and 36.64%, respectively. Also, it is concluded that the higher current density and lower operating temperature, will raise the total cost rate.

AB In view of the gradual promotion of Single Fuel Concept in the military field and also the rotary engine (RE) which has been widely applied in specialized equipment, it is necessary to study the basic spray characteristics of aviation kerosene under RE operation conditions and optimize the fuel injection strategies. In this research, an optically visible constant volume combustion chamber platform for Mie-scattering and a validated three-dimensional dynamic simulation model of aviation kerosene fueled direct injection rotary engine (DI-RE) were established. The experimental results show that the ambient temperature and pressure affect the spray process differently. There is no linear relationship between ambient temperature and penetration length. The ambient temperature of 600 K is a watershed, when it is below 600 K, the penetration length increases as the temperature rises. When the temperature reaches 600 K, the penetration length decreases rapidly which means a prominent improvement of atomization quality. On the basis of experimental results, the simulation was carried out and the results show that different injection strategies have important effect on distribution of fuel in cylinder, the larger injection angle will promote the atomization of fuel due to the collision between the spray and air flow field. In Case A3, B2 and C2, the fuel mainly distributes near the spark plugs in the center of the combustion chamber, which is supposed to be more conducive to the ignition and diffusion combustion process of the fuel.

AB Wastewater treatment is one of the most energy-consuming processes in the water sector, requiring both electric and thermal energy. In order to improve their sustainability, renewable energy sources can supply such energy demands in wastewater treatment plants, especially in small islands, where the lack of connections with mainland and environmental restrictions promote the use of unconventional fuels and technologies for energy production and waste treatment. For this reason, in this work, the use of geothermal energy is proposed for electric and thermal energy generation for wastewater and sludge treatment. An energy, exergy and economic analysis for the developed system is carried out. The study is carried out for a district wastewater treatment plant on the island of Ischia, in southem Italy, which presents diffused low-medium enthalpy geothermal sources, considered in this work to power an organic Rankine cycle system for electric energy production and to heat the desiccant flow for sludge drying. The proposed system reduces sludge to be disposed by around 70% and it covers 100% of the electrical energy demand of the wastewater treatment plant, with a production of 1.68 kWh per kg of processed sludge. Despite the high investment, the revenues deriving from the avoided sludge disposal and the electricity production, make the system convenient, with a simple payback of about 5 years and a saving of CO2 equivalent emissions equal to 628 tons/year. Therefore, the energy, exergy and economic analysis of the proposed system shows that the geothermal source is a viable and environmentally sustainable solution to produce electrical and thermal energy for wastewater and sludge treatment plants, especially in small islands or energy isolated systems, where electric energy supply and sewage sludge treatment are commonly critical challenges.

AB Energy management is a fundamental task in hybrid electric vehicle community. Efficient energy management of hybrid electric vehicle is challenging owning to its enormous search space, multitudinous control variables and complicated driving conditions. Most existing methods apply discretization to approximate the continuous optimum in real driving conditions, which results in relatively low performance with the discretization error and curse of dimensionality. We introduce a novel energy management strategy with a deep reinforcement learning framework Actor-Critic to address these challenges. Actor-Critic uses a deep neural network, named as actor network, to directly output continuous control signals. Another deep neural network, named as critic network, evaluates the control signals generated by the actor network. The actor and critic neural network are trained by reinforcement learning from self-play in a continuous action space. Several comprehensive experiments are conducted in this paper, the proposed method surpasses discretization-based strategies by directly optimizing in the continuous space, which improves energy management performance while blackucing computation load. The simulation results indicate that the AC achieve the optimal energy distribution in comparison with the discretization-based strategies, especially surpassing the existing baseline DP by 5.5%, 2.9%, 9.5% in CTUDC, WVUCITY and WVUSUB in one-tenth of the computational cost.

AB Due to the high level of pollutant emissions from traditional marine diesel engines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as clean energy is becoming a better choice for main engines to replace the traditional fuels. Meanwhile, in order to improve the energy efficiency of the marine power system, the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) has been regarded as the most suitable solution to recover the waste heat for the power generation of vessels. In this paper, both the waste heat of the main engine and the cold energy of LNG have been fully considered, and a novel triple ORC process has been proposed for the waste heat and cold energy recovery of LNG-fueled vessels. It adopts the exhaust gas of the main engine and the cooling water from the engine jacket as heat sources, and uses the cold energy of LNG and the sea water as cold sources. Based on the 15 optional working fluid conditions, the heat source utilization rate, system exergy efficiency, net output power, and system cost are, respectively, combined as two objectives, and the multi-objective adaptive firefly algorithm is used to optimize the thermodynamic performance of the system. The optimization results of different heat and cold sources as well as the design parameters have been discussed. Finally, the system's exergy loss has been analyzed to make suggestions for further improvement. The results show that this novel ORC system can better meet the energy recovery requirements of LNG-fueled vessels, with higher net output power, lower cost, and greater energy recovery efficiency. The largest exergy loss of the system exists in the condensers of the stages 2 and 3, and the expanders in the various stages. Therefore, subsequent cooling energy recovery and the use of Stirling engines can be considered to further improve the system efficiency.

AB Living walls have a great potential for the improvement of the building energy performances and the indoor comfort as well as for positive changes in dense urban areas. Despite this evidence, the design criteria have not be discussed in the available literature. This paper proposes a complete numerical approach for selecting the optimal living wall package in the Mediterranean climate areas. With a parametric analysis, the incidence of plants' type, substrate's materials, air-gap and thickness of the main materials on energy performance, thermal comfort and polluting emissions is evaluated. A multi-objective optimization is applied to a subset of solutions and for the optimal configurations the thermal field is studied by means of the computational fluid dynamic approach. The advantage of proposed method is the combined evaluations of multiple variables with simplicity in execution; for this reason it could be repeated for studying other innovative solutions. Results indicate that the better exposure for the living wall is the west one. The minimization of the cooling energy demand requires the adoption of grass species while the minimization of the heating energy demand the sedum plantings. Moreover, simulations show that the main advantage is the great incidence on the passive control of indoor microclimate with a reduction of operating hours of air-conditioning systems and of energy costs.

AB Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is promising in distributed generation owing to its load reliability in complementing intermittent renewable energy sources. However, the existing PEMFC operational researches, usually developed based on the constant current (CC) mode, is not compatible with the grid-connected applications, which instead requires the PEMFC to operate under the constant net power (CP) mode. Some novel difficulties are revealed in association with the couplings caused by the CP operation. An iterative algorithm is developed to decouple the computational interactions so that the steady-state variables can be derived. The efficiency analysis gives the static references of the oxygen excess ratio (OER), which is, however, revealed as contradicting with the voltage requirement of the inverter. Thus, it results in the optimal OER reference modified. In dynamic operation, a peculiar initial inverse response of the OER is exhibited under the CP mode, which requires more cautious controller design than that under the CC mode. Moreover, a power profile govemor is designed to prevent the stack voltage from decreasing below the lower bound during transient. Finally, the simulation demonstrates the feasibility and capability of the proposed method in compensating for the renewable intermittency, laying a foundation for the future work on the grid-connected PEMFC.

AB Solar and wind energy pose a challenge to direct power grid acceptance due to their randomness, intermittency and fluctuation, whereas hydropower with rapid response, good adjustability and stable output has become the most preferred option for complementary energy. In this study, a novel approach to optimal sizing of large-scale hydro-photovoltaic (PV) hybrid systems considering electricity delivery demand and reservoir characteristics has been proposed. We establish a multi-objective mathematical model that minimizes the difference between the daily output process of the hydro-PV hybrid system and the setting-up characteristic load process while maximizing the daily power generation of the hydro-PV hybrid system. The proposed method was applied to a multi energy complementary base in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Qinghai Province, China. The results show that the optimal PV capacity for a hydro-PV hybrid system and the complementary guarantee rate are closely related to electricity delivery demand and reservoir characteristics. It was observed that at the complementary guarantee rate of 0.7, the optimal PV capacities of the Yangqu-PV hybrid system were 402 and 425 MW under three- and five-segment line modes, respectively, with the corresponding optimal PV capacities of the Banduo-PV hybrid system at 129 and 154 MW under three- and five-segment line modes, respectively. Additionally, the Yangqu-PV hybrid system meets bimodal and unimodal load shaving well; however, the Banduo-PV hybrid system only satisfies unimodal load shaving well. Finally, simulation results indicate that upstream reservoir regulation, hydropower expansion and regulated storage capacity expansion benefit the complementarity between hydro and PV. The highlighted results verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Therefore, the proposed method provides technical support and reference for planning and constructing PV power plants and can be used to implement other hybrid systems in the future.

AB An innovative CO2 pressurization system combined with supercritical CO2 (sCO(2)) open power cycle is proposed in this study. The combined system reduced the power demand associated with CO2 pressurization in the CO2 capture and storage (CCS) process as well as utilized the captured CO2 in a sCO(2) power cycle to generate power. As the first step, conventional multi-stage compression was complemented with CO2 liquefaction and pumping to reduce the compression power. Later, a waste heat-powered recuperative sCO(2) power cycle was employed to generate additional electric power.
   The vapor compression cycle (VCC) was first modeled, validated, and explored for CO2 liquefaction and pumping. Refrigerants R717, R134a, R290, and R32 were analyzed as the VCC working fluid. An initial thermodynamic analysis was performed to identify the most influential liquefaction parameters. Then, a genetic algorithm optimization module in MATLAB was used to minimize the overall power consumption in the VCC. The VCC was integrated with a sCO(2) cycle to utilize the high pressure CO2, and after optimizing the VCC, the performance of the sCO(2) cycle was evaluated. Results of our study revealed that integrating the sCO(2) cycle with a CO2 liquefaction and pumping cycle reduced power consumption by 13.88% compared to conventional multi-stage compression. Finally, sensitivity analysis with respect to the crucial thermodynamic parameter was also performed.

AB The prices of the bio-diesel and bio-gasoline are normally significantly high when compared to the petroleum-derived fuels. The co-processing of bio-oil and vacuum gas oil in a fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) has been proposed to utilize existing refinery infrastructures while lowering bio-fuel prices. Nonetheless, the integration of the bio-oil production and the existing refinery remains unknown. In this work, a superstructure model is proposed to design and optimize the co-processing process by selecting the optimal biomass feedstock and the bio-oil production process (fast pyrolysis or catalytic pyrolysis). Furthermore, the impacts of the FCC processing capability and bio-oil co-processing ratio on the economics as well as the selection of bio-oil production process are also investigated. As revealed by the results of two scenarios, pulpwood is the optimal biomass feedstock and the fast pyrolysis ought to be selected for producing bio-oil when its co-processing ratio and the FCC processing capability are both relatively high.

AB The proposed system uses the thermal energy storage characteristic of the solar pond to power a multi-effect desalination (MED) process with a total fresh water production of approximately 14,000 m(3) annually. Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) alongside photo-assisted chloralkali reactor are employed to utilize the brine rejected from the desalination process. The inclusion of PRO is proposed to take advantage of the salinity difference that occurs as a result of the preparation of the solar pond and desalination process. The quest for zero salt discharge in the proposed energy system configuration is undertaken through the introduction of a photo-assisted chloralkali reactor, which is conducted utilizing the power generated from PRO, and solar pond storage arrangement. This solar pond and desalination coupling system will achieve independence from conventional energy sources, which will lead to a significant contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil-fuel driven desalination. At solar irradiation of 600 W/m(2), the overall energy and exergy efficiencies can reach 16.4% and 1.40/0, respectively. The annual average overall energy efficiency of 11.4% is achieved utilizing the integrated system, whereas the average overall exergy efficiency is about 0.9%. Parametric studies are performed to examine the impacts of ambient conditions, irradiance, solar pond geometry, brine salinity, and the total number of MED effects on the performance of the overall integrated system. In addition to the sensitivity analysis, the potential to improve overall energy and exergy efficiencies and fresh water production of the proposed system is demonstrated.

AB Generating electricity by a biomechanical energy harvester whose input energy is human joint mechanical energy can reduce user requirements to carry backup batteries. In this work, a lightweight cable-pulley harvester mounted on knee joint has been designed. In order to reduce the weight and raise the center of mass of the harvester, we use a cable-pulley mechanism instead of the gear train. The cable-pulley mechanical transmission converts the flexion and extension of the knee joint to the line movement of the nut of a ball screw. The ball screw operates in the inverse mode and converts the line movement of the nut to the rotor shaft of a generator. The transmission structure from flexion and extension to line to rotation consists of a speed up mechanism that can convert low velocity and high torque at knee joint into high velocity and low torque at the rotor shaft of the generator. A dynamic model of the electromagnetic torque is established for choosing the optimal mechanical parameters. Being different from other lower limb single joint biomechanical energy harvesters that operate in the generative braking mode, the cable-pulley harvester needs not gait phase detection system and operates in the full cycle generation mode that makes the harvester more reliable and applicable. The experimental results show that the cable-pulley harvester produces average 4.1 W of electricity with the lightest mass and the highest power density, and the growth rate of user metabolic power remains low.

AB Double skin facades (DSFs) are known by their capacity to generate a natural heating energy during winter by increasing the greenhouse effect in the air cavity between the inner and the outer facade. However, this effect provides an undesirable overheating during summer. In this study, a smart DSF configuration able to control the greenhouse effect generation was numerically simulated using a two dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) method. The aim of these simulations is to investigate the thermal and the energetic behavior of a DSF integrating Tungsten (W) doped Vanadium dioxide (VO2) as an optically smart thin material and a high absorbing aluminum nitride (AlN) coating. A parametric study was carried out in order to analyze the impact of the air cavity thickness on the smart DSF behavior. Four thicknesses (10, 25, 50 and 75 mm) were inspected and compared with an uninsulated massive wall configuration. Results have shown that the smart configuration reduces significantly both heating and cooling loads. Indoor surface temperature has been decreased by around 2 degrees C during summer and increased by around 3 degrees C during a sunny winter day. The air velocity results have shown that the natural convection-radiation interaction during winter is higher than during summer. Thus, the new smart DSF configuration presented in this paper can effectively control the greenhouse effect depending on extemal climatic conditions.

AB Due to its robustness and simplicity, the simple actuator disk is still the most used and popular method for performance analysis of horizontal axis wind turbines. However, the hub blockage effect is generally disregarded in this approach, thus worsening the accuracy of its results. This is particularly true for small-sized wind turbines whose ratio between the hub and rotor radii can be as large as 25-30%. In order to obtain some insights onto the impact of the hub blockage-effect on the performance prediction, this paper presents a free-wake ring-vortex actuator disk method accounting for an axisymmetric hub of general shape. The fundamental concept of a uniformly loaded disk without wake rotation is adopted. In the proposed method, the flows induced by the disk and the hub are both modelled by ring sheet-vortices which are discretised through a classical panel method. An iterative solution procedure is developed to evaluate the density strength distribution of the sheets and the wake shape. To this aim, the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition is used for the velocity just beneath the hub sheet, while the free force condition is imposed all along the wake boundary. The latter is also required to be aligned with the overall flow field. The method is verified comparing its results with those of a Computational Fluid-Dynamics-based approach, and of the classical axial momentum theory showing a very good agreement in both cases. Finally, some insights on the hub blockage effect are presented showing that, for a small-sized wind turbine, this effect significantly affect the flow distribution all along the blade span. In the analysed cases, the increment in the axial velocity at the disk, due to the hub blockage, goes from 20% in the hub proximity to 2% at the tip. The above values suggest that the hub blockage effect should never be disregarded in the analysis of small-sized wind turbines.

AB In response to global climate target, over the last decade renewable electricity generation from solar energy has grown rapidly and hence measures to deal with its non-dispatchable nature. Integrating concentrating solar plants in conventional fossil power plants is a widely researched solution to tackle solar energy intermittency. This results in hybrid power plants whose total electricity production consists of two different contributions (solar and fuel-electricity) that can be evaluated separately by implementing numerical methods based on the so-called "with and without solar energy" approach. Nonetheless, such evaluation cannot be carried out in actual power plants operation where fossil and renewable contributions are not discernible from each other within the overall production.
   To overcome this limitation, and consequently allow the total electricity generated to be properly partitioned among energy sources, this study proposes and validates an alternative "on-line and real-time" method to quantitatively assess solar and fuel-electricity by subdividing the overall cycle efficiency into subsequent ones related to the different energy conversion processes during real plant operation. Required input can be derived from available operating data except for factor of internal losses that, however, showing negligible dependence on solar energy and power plant load, can be reasonably assumed constant and estimated in dedicated calculations.

AB In the large-scale chemical plant, energy efficiency evaluation and management plays a crucial role in the sustainable development. However, most data-driven approaches to calculating energy efficiency still focus on the deterministic evaluation regardless of the effects resulting from the data quality. Besides, because of the multi-dimensional, stochastic and uncertain characteristics of the collected industrial data, it is more difficult to accurately and reliably evaluate and predict the energy usage of the complex chemical production process. To solve these limitations, a novel energy efficiency evaluation and prediction method integrated with the Gaussian process (GP) and the partial least squares (PIS) analysis, named GP-PLS method, is proposed in this paper. This integrated method can select the appropriate sampling data, construct the corresponding nonlinear model and indicate the reliability of the model. Based on the constructed models, not only are the accurate energy efficiency evaluation results calculated, but the energy efficiency tendency is also predicted. In addition, according to the reliability of the established model, the informative data are intelligently selected from the historical database to enhance the quality of the model. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are demonstrated through a numerical example and a practical ethylene production. The evaluation results and the prediction values are acquired to decrease the energy consumption, guide the production process and improve the energy efficiency level in the large-scale chemical plant.

AB This work introduces and develops the concepts of solar exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental maps for photovoltaic systems. These maps are developed to complement the information provided by solar exergy maps for recognizing the most appropriate sites for hosting photovoltaic power plants. A detailed case study is carried out to demonstrate how the proposed approaches can be practically applied to promote solar photovoltaic systems. More specifically, the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental performances of a 100 kW grid-connected photovoltaic plant are assessed for several Iranian cities over the year based on actual climatic, economic, and environmental impact data. The spatio-temporal solar maps for unit exergoeconomic cost and unit exergoenvironmental impact of electricity generation are then developed for the investigated climatic conditions for the first time. In order to demonstrate the suitability and reliability of the developed maps, their inter operations are assessed and compared to those for exergy efficiency. The results show that solar exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental maps provide more valuable information on the performance of solar photovoltaic systems than exergy efficiency maps, demonstrating their robustness for optimum site selection and plant sizing. In addition, the exergy efficiency maps may result in inappropriate site selection of photovoltaic solar farms. The central, south, southeast, and some west parts of Iran are the most suitable locations for implementing photovoltaic power fields from exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental viewpoints. The developed approaches can also be used for locating and sizing other renewable energy systems under different climatic conditions.

AB Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have been attracting an increasing attention in recent years because of their potential for effectively using wind energy. The tip vortices from the VAWT blades have a negative impact on the power efficiency. Since a winglet has been proved to be effective in decreasing the tip vortex in the aerospace field, this paper numerically studies the aerodynamic effect of appending a winglet on the blade of a VAWT. Based on the theoretical motion pattern of the VAWT blade, this paper simplifies the three-dimensional full-scale rotor simulation to a one-blade oscillating problem in order to reduce the computational cost. The full rotor model simulation is also used in validating the result. The numerical approach has been validated by the experimental data that is available in the open literature. Six parameters are applied in defining the configuration of the winglet. The orthogonal experimental design (OED) approach is adopted in this paper to determine the significance of the design parameters that affect the rotor's power coefficient. The OED results show that the twist angle of the winglet is the most significant factor that affects the winglet's performance. A range analysis of the OED results produces an optimal variable arrangement in the current scope, and the winglet's performance in this variable arrangement is compared with the blade without a winglet. For the single blade study, the comparison result shows that the optimal winglet can decrease the tip vortices and improve the blade's power performance by up to 31% at a tip speed ratio of 2.29. However, for the full VAWT case, the relative enhancement in the power coefficient is about 10.5, 6.7, and 10.0% for TSRs of 1.85, 2.29, and 2.52, respectively. The winglet assists in maintain the pressure difference between the two sides of the blade, thus weakening the tip vortex and improving the aerodynamic efficiency of the surface near the blade tip.

AB Hierarchical zeolites have superior catalytic properties over purely microporous zeolites, leading to the enhanced diffusivity of molecules and strong acidity of the catalyst. In this study, hierarchical desilicated mesoporous ZSM-5 and Beta were prepared by the desilication of commercial microporous zeolites and applied to the catalytic pyrolysis of wood polymer composites. Hierarchical desilicated mesoporous ZSM-5 and Beta showed the typical X-ray diffraction patterns of microporous ZSM-5 and Beta with higher mesoporosity compared to the parent materials. The activity of the desilicated zeolites for the catalytic pyrolysis of wood polymer composites was evaluated using a thermograyimetric analysis and tandem micro reactor-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Among the catalysts tested, the lowest decomposition temperatures of wood polymer composites were observed using hierarchical desilicated mesoporous Beta followed by hierarchical desilicated mesoporous ZSM-5 and ZSM-5. This trend correlated well with the mesoporosity of the catalysts. The formation efficiency of hierarchical desilicated mesoporous ZSM-5 was highest followed by microporous ZSM-5, hierarchical desilicated mesoporous Beta, and Beta, indicating that in addition to mesoporosity, the shape selectivity induced by microporosity and strong acidity are important for the aromatization of pyrolysis vapors. In addition, the aromatic formation efficiency of the catalysts differed according to the properties of wood polymer composites. Compared to wood polymer composite 2, wood polymer composite 1 produced a larger quantity of aromatics during catalytic pyrolysis over all the catalysts at 500 degrees C owing to its higher polyethylene content. Both wood polymer composites exhibited a similar aromatic formation efficiency during catalytic pyrolysis at 600 degrees C because the diffusion hindering effect of polypropylene molecules to the catalyst pores was lower at the higher temperature.

AB Grass silage is an excellent feedstock for biofuel production, however, the recalcitrant cellulosic structure may limit its biodegradability. In this study, the effect of acid pre-treatment with mild thermal treatment conditions on biohydrogen and biomethane production from grass silage was assessed through single-stage (CH4) and two stage (H-2 + CH4) fermentation. Microstructural characterisation showed that pre-treatment significantly reduced the recalcitrance and enlarged the specific area of grass silage. The optimal pre-treatment with 2% H2SO4 at 135 degrees C for 15 min achieved a total reducing sugar yield of 333.79 mg/g volatile solid (VS) of grass silage. The pre-treated silage led to a hydrogen yield of 68.26 ml/g VS in the first stage hydrogen fermentation, a 3-fold increase compared to untreated silage. The production of volatile fatty acids accordingly increased by 29.2%. In the second stage anaerobic digestion, untreated silage achieved the highest biomethane yield of 392.84 ml/g VS, with a corresponding highest total energy conversion efficiency of 83.5%. Due to a lower biomethane yield, the pre-treated silage presented a decreased total energy efficiency of 68.4%. In comparison, single-stage anaerobic digestion showed lower energy conversion efficiencies of 49.7% and 54.2% for the pre-treated and untreated silage, respectively. Despite the slight decrease in CH4 yield, the pre-treatment led to decreased energy consumption for the operation of anaerobic digestion processes due to the shorter digestion duration.

AB The heat transfer from the in-cylinder gases to the wall dramatically affects the combustion and emission characteristics of internal combustion engines, particularly for the engines operated with advanced low-temperature combustion modes. In the present work, an improved heat transfer model was established based on an enhanced thermal wall function using the piecewise functions, in which only the laminar Prandtl number is considered in the viscous sublayer, and the competition between the laminar Prandtl number and the turbulent Prandtl number is taken into account in the buffer layer and turbulent core regions. By implementing the improved heat transfer model into a computational fluid dynamics code, the predictions of the combustion processes and the heat transfer behaviors of an engine operated with conventional diesel combustion, homogeneous charge compression ignition, and reactivity controlled compression ignition modes were validated by the experimental data. Moreover, the computational results from two previous heat transfer models, i.e., Han and Reitz model and Rakopoulos et al. model, were presented for comparison. The results indicate that the heat flux characteristics under different combustion modes can be more satisfactorily reproduced using the improved heat transfer model than Han and Reitz model and Rakopoulos et al, model by avoiding the flaws in the thermal wall function. Finally, the influence of the dimensionless distance of the computational grid adjacent to the wall on the predicted heat flux was discussed to study the dependence of the heat transfer model on the size of the near wall computational grid.

AB Organic Rankine cycle is a power system for the widely use of medium- to low-grade ( < 200 degrees C) thermal energy. Adopting the dual-pressure evaporation cycle and zeotropic mixtures are important approaches to increase the efficiency of organic Rankine cycle system. The combination of two approaches presents considerable potential to integrate their advantages and further increase the system efficiency significantly. However, for the dual pressure evaporation organic Rankine cycle using zeotropic mixtures, the studies on the exergy performance are blank up to now. The obtained efficiency increments by combination, reached exergy efficiency, and characteristics of irreversible loss distribution remain unclear. This study carried out a comprehensive exergy analysis on the dual-pressure evaporation organic Rankine cycle using isobutane/isopentane mixtures. The exergy efficiency and irreversible loss distribution were analyzed. The superiority of combining dual-pressure evaporation cycle and zeotropic mixtures was evaluated. Results show that the largest exergy efficiency of dual pressure evaporation cycle using isobutane/isopentane mixtures is 43.10/0-61.7% for heat sources of 100-200 degrees C, and the largest exergy efficiency initially increases and then decreases with increasing heat source temperature. The largest irreversible loss occurs in the heat absorption, expansion, and heat release processes for heat sources of 100-160 degrees C, 170-180 degrees C and 190-200 degrees C, respectively. The exergy efficiency of dual-pressure evaporation cycle using isobutane/isopentane mixtures is the largest for heat sources below approximately 180 degrees C, and the maximum relative increments are 11.60/0 and 25.6% compared with the dual-pressure evaporation cycle using isobutane and single-pressure evaporation cycle using isobutane/isopentane mixtures, respectively.

AB Dual-loop organic Rankine cycle is a great potential technology to recover engine waste heat for energy saving. Transcritical cycle can improve exergy efficiency of heat transfer process in the evaporator, and zeotropic mixtures furtherly can improve thermal match with heat source and sink. Thus, a transcritical-subcritical dual loop organic Rankine cycle system using zeotropic mixtures is adopted for engine waste heat recovery, and system without and with regenerator is considered. The whole system is assumed in the steady state, R600a/R601a and R134a/R245fa mixtures are used as working fluid of transcritical and subcritical cycle, respectively. Parametric analysis and optimization about turbine inlet temperature and pressure of high-temperature loop, evaporation temperature of low-temperature loop are carried out. According to the results, the designed parameters have great effect on performance of system, and for the system without and with regenerator, the optimal turbine inlet temperature, pressure and evaporation temperature are 260 degrees C, 11 MPa, 85 degrees C and 250 degrees C, 10 MPa, 85 degrees C respectively. Moreover, the effects of components of mixtures on the performance of system are analyzed. The results demonstrate that system with zeotropic mixtures can significantly improve the performance of system. The system without regenerator using R600a/R601a (0.2/0.8) and R134a/R245fa (0.4/0.6) shows the maximum power output of 97.49 kW which is higher 5.48-20.00% than pure fluids, and system with regenerator using R600a/R601a (0.3/0.7) and R134a/R245fa (0.4/0.6) achieves the maximum power output of 97.95 kW, increment of 6.52-19.78% compared with using pure fluids. And the power output of engine can be improved by 9.79% and 9.83% for the system without and with regenerator, respectively. Furthermore, the exergy destruction analysis demonstrates that zeotropic mixtures can reduce heat transfer exergy destruction and total exergy destruction of system.

AB In the present work, a new design of a multi-generation system based on biomass and solar energy with the purpose of generating electric power, heating, cooling, hydrogen, and potable water is introduced. The system comprises a steam Rankine cycle, double effect absorption chiller, proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, multi-effect desalination, and parabolic trough solar collector. A thermodynamic analysis is carried out to present the thermodynamic feasibility and deficiencies by calculating the irreversibilities occurring in the components. Exergoeconomic modeling yields the product cost rate of different products and cost flow in the studied system. Also in order to determine the amount of environmental effect of the suggested system, the exergoenvironmental study is performed and discussed. Results demonstrate that energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, total product cost rate and exergoenvironmental impact improvement of 82.4%, 14%, 0.84 $/s and 0.15 are achievable for the multi-generation system respectively. Finally, multi-criteria optimization approach based on a genetic algorithm is applied to specify the optimum design of the system considering the improvement of thermodynamic and thermoeconomic performance. By extracting the Pareto frontier, a design scheme related to exergy efficiency of 16.53% and product cost rate of 0.71 $/s is selected as an optimal design.

AB In this work, energy, exergy and electricity generation performance of an integrated system was conceptually investigated by using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) under 200-1000 W/m(2) solar irradiation interval. The system comprises evacuated tube solar collectors (EVTSCs) with the surface area of 100 m(2), an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and a low-grade geothermal resource. The EVTSCs were used to enhance the temperature of the low-grade water coming from the geothermal source. The calculations were carried out for three geothermal sources in Kula (63 degrees C), Saraycik (74 degrees C) and Turgutlu (86 degrees C), respectively. N-hexane, n-pentane and n-butane were selected as a working fluid in the ORC. It was determined that the selection of the working fluid affected the performance of the ORC. And also, the waste heat is extracted from the ORC were used efficiently for space heating. As a result, the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the system and power generation of the ORC were seriously affected by enhancing the water temperature of the geothermal resources by EVTSCs. The maximum overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the system were calculated as to be 6.92% and 21.06% by using n-butane for the source in Turgutlu, respectively. The minimum overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the system were calculated as 0.32% and 2.19% by using n-hexane for the source in Kula, respectively. The maximum and minimum generated electricity were calculated as to be 19.46 kW and 0.6168 kW for the sources in Turgutlu and Kula, respectively. It was seen that the best performance of the system was found for n-butane compared to n-pentane and n-hexane.

AB The degradation prediction is an effective tool for the long-lasting operation of the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). In this paper, a novel grey neural network model (GNNM) method combined with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the moving window method is presented to forecast the degradation of PEMFC under different operating conditions. The proposed method considers the influence of load current, inlet temperature, inlet hydrogen pressure, and inlet relative humidity. The degradation prediction model of PEMFC is established by a grey neural network. The initial weight and threshold of established GNNM are optimized by the PSO. The optimized PSO-GNNM is iteratively trained based on the moving window method through several newly measured data. The influence of different moving window sizes on the degradation prediction of the PEMFC under the static load current is investigated. Then, a comparison between the proposed method and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system method is discussed. Moreover, the influence of the load current on the degradation prediction of PEMFCs in postal fuel cell electric vehicle operating under real conditions is analyzed. Finally, the proposed method is validated using 3 PEMFC aging experiments under different conditions. The results show that the proposed method can precisely forecast the degradation for PEMFC on different applications.

AB The extracted marine Chlorella sp. residue (EMCR) was used as a feedstock for biochar and bio-oil production. The biochar was prepared by slow pyrolysis at 450 degrees C for 60 min in a tube furnace and employed as a microwave absorber (MA). The bio-oil was produced by microwave pyrolysis (MWP) with investigation of temperature (350-450 degrees C), time (20-40 min) and MA loading (10-30 wt%) at fixed microwave power of 850 W. The pyrolysis condition was optimized to obtain maximum bio-oil yield using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design (CCD). The optimum condition was 350 degrees C, 15% MA loading and 40 min, which yielded 46% bio-oil. Characterization of Chlorella sp. biomass, EMCR, biochar and bio-oil was performed by proximate and ultimate analysis, FTIR, TGA and GC-MS. The higher heating values of biomass, EMCR and biochar were 22.43, 15.49 and 10.79 MJ/kg, respectively. The results showed a high feasibility of applying EMCR as the feedstock for biochar and bio-oil production. The EMCR derived biochar presented great efficiency as the MA with high surface area of 266 m(2)/g. The bio-oil consisted of a mixture of chemicals, which requires further processes before using in many applications.

AB Managing the energy is one of the most important issues for the efficiency of vehicular applications using hybrid electric power systems. This paper deals with an analysis of an energy management for hybrid power system, which consists of fuel cell, ultra-capacitor and battery and dedicated to electrical vehicles. Thus, an energy management method is applied in order to split the energy flow between the three used sources. This strategy is based on a combination of three control methods; a fuzzy logic control, a flatness control and rule-based algorithm. For the fuzzy logic, the main idea is inspired from rule-based algorithms except that it is more flexible and less aggressive. The second technic is an innovative control using the flatness property for a Fuel cell/supercapacitor/Battery hybrid power system. For the rules based algorithm, it uses a supercapacitor state-of charge control principle. Then, an experimental validation is done for the energy management method to show the efficiency of the proposed control strategy in term of the well share of the energy between sources to satisfy the load demand. A dSpace real-time card is used for management algorithm implementation and data acquisition. The obtained experimental results prove the efficiency and the validity of the proposed supervisor.

AB Biodiesel production from non-edible feedstock such as microalgae is gaining importance in present day, as they do not interfere with global food economy in addition to higher photosynthetic efficiency as compared to plants. Fresh water grown Neochloris oleoabundans UTEx 1185 is considered as a potential source for biodiesel production. The present study investigated different direct lipid extraction process from wet microalgal biomass through autoclaving, microwave, and ulmasonication pretreatments. Autoclave treatment showed a higher efficiency for lipid extraction as compared to other two pretreatments. Furthermore, transesterification process was carried out in presence of Fe2O3 catalyst and compared with conventional acid (HCl) and base (NaOH) catalysts. Fe2O3 nanoparticles used were synthesized from extract of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis by green procedure. The synthesized Fe2O3 catalyst played an important role in improving the biodiesel yield up to 81%, which is higher than that obtained with HCl (64%) and NaOH (48%). Thereafter transesterification process parameter like catalyst content, reaction temperature and reaction time were optimized and finally 86% biodiesel yield was obtained. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) profile analysis and fuel properties revealed the suitability of algal lipid for biodiesel production. 20.2% w/w of carbohydrate present in lipid extracted microalgal biomass was further converted into biohydrogen by dark fermentation and bioethanol under anaerobic condition using acidogenic mixed consortia and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (INVSC-1), respectively. The life cycle assessment study of the overall process was also done.

AB The integration of supercritical CO2 (SCO2) cycle instead of steam Rankine cycle may be a revolutionary technique to increase the efficiency of coal-fired power plants. To effectively extract exergy from the fluegas and convert exergy to power, the characteristics of hot end (heat reservoir) and cold end (heat sink) should be fully considered, and the system multi-parameters should be optimized. In this study, based on a benchmark coal-fired power plant integrated with a recompression SCO2 power cycle, quantitative efficiency enhancements of system improvements of the hot end and cold end for SCO2 power cycle are calculated and compared. The optimized efficiency of benchmark coal-fired plant integrated with recompression SCO2 power cycle is 45.43%. When the fluegas at the economizer outlet is effectively used, the power plant efficiency can be increased by 1.32%. With single and double reheats to decrease the heat transfer irreversibility of the hot end, the power plant efficiency can be increased by 1.77% and 2.24%, respectively. Cold end optimization with single intercooling and cold air preheating can increase the power plant efficiency by 0.32% and 0.33%, respectively. Finally, a simple structure system and a complex structure system are proposed. With optimal system parameters, the power plant efficiencies of the complex and simple systems are 49.320/0 and 48.52%, respectively.

AB In this study, a new renewable energy based integrated system is developed where it stores the excess power generated in the form of ammonia. The developed system integrates both solar and wind energy resources. A dynamic simulation is performed considering the variations in solar radiation intensities as well as wind speeds across the year. The proposed methodology utilizes excess power available during periods of high solar radiation or wind speeds to synthesize and store ammonia that can be utilized for power generation during periods of low energy availability, through ammonia fed solid oxide fuel cells. Further, a reverse osmosis desalination system is also utilized for producing fresh desalinated water during periods of high energy availability. The system performance is simulated and analyzed thermodynamically on the average days of each month. The overall energy efficiency of the developed system is determined to vary between 46.1% and 53.3% across the year. Also, the overall exergy efficiency is found to vary between 34% and 41.5%. The ammonia fed solid oxide fuel cell is observed to have an energy efficiency in the range of 51.9%-80.8% and the exergy efficiency is observed to vary between 51.9% and 91.5%. The energy output potential of the proposed ammonia and solid oxide fuel cell based energy storage system is determined to be 28,463 kWh at the peak value, and the maximum daily fresh water production is evaluated to be 20891.5 tonnes/day.

AB Energy is the essential need for the development, modernization and economic growth of any nation in the industrial sector. About 32-35% of the total energy of the world is used in the industrial sector. Solar thermal energy application is an initiative towards the sustainable and zero-carbon energy future. Solar thermal collectors are recognized as promising alternatives for fossil fuels in the industrial sector for process heat due to energy security, economic feasibility and environmental benefits. This work is an extensive compilation and review of the recent literature concerning research works carried out to solar thermal collectors and its industrial applications, global advancements in solar thermal technologies, collectors and the solar thermal energy storage system with a focus on the sun tracking system, thermal performance, and modeling techniques. In this review paper, current industrial process-heat systems are classified based on solar collector technologies and heat demand temperatures for the identification of typical applications for solar process heat. These classifications are pertinent to every country within the same industry type along with similar weather and economic conditions. Moreover, future prospects to integrate solar heat in the heat supply level of an industrial company in Pakistan is outlined for a sustainable energy system. It is found that solar thermal technologies can be used for a variety of industrial applications for sustainable energy system in industries and these should be used for industrial applications which are more compatible to be integrated.

AB A novel hybrid parabolic trough power system that integrates direct steam generation and molten salt systems is proposed in this study to stably and efficiently operate solar power plants. The feedwater from the power block is preheated and evaporated in a low temperature direct steam generation solar field. A high-temperature solar field using molten salt as heat transfer fluid is employed to superheat and reheat the steam to 540 degrees C. The heat transfer model based on energy conversion and balance is applied to numerically investigate the overall performance of various power plants. This paper presents a comparative study of the effects of different locations, steam turbines, and system configurations on the outputs of the power plants. The hybrid systems exhibit favorable system stability and reliability and an excellent overall performance. The molten salt loop percentages of hybrid systems with and without reheat section are only 45.1% and 37.4%, which lead to low energy loss in the operation period and low molten salt freezing protection energy. The annual thermal energy productions of the hybrid systems with and without the reheat section in Tonopah are 685.1 and 691.7 GWh, and the percentages of energy required for freezing protection of those systems are 3.2% and 2.7%, respectively. The hybrid systems with reheat section exhibit optimal electricity production and economic performances compared with those of other configurations. The electricity production increments of novel systems in Tonopah and Lhasa are 14.0% and 14.8%, respectively, compared with those of molten salt systems.

AB Identifying the optimum parameters of photovoltaic models based on the measured current-voltage info is a vital step in monitoring, simulating, and optimizing the photovoltaic systems. We need efficient optimizers to reliably obtain the best model's parameters. In this study, a novel optimizer is proposed to effectively approximate the unknown parameters of solar cells and PV modules. The proposed ISCA is constructed based on the exploratory and exploitative cores of the sine cosine algorithm (SCA). Also, it is enhanced using the Nelder-Mead simplex (NMs) concept and the opposition-based learning (OBL) scheme. In ISCA, NMs method can guarantee the population's intensification and enhance the exploitation ability. In addition, the opposition-based learning scheme can improve the diversification of the population, which ensures a more steady balance between exploitation and exploration trends. The theory and structure of this algorithm are concise; therefore, it can be implemented easily. The developed ISCA is utilized to realize the unidentified parameters of the single diode, double diode, and photovoltaic module. Inclusive results and statistical analyses imply that the ISCA is superior to most of the reported techniques with regard to the accuracy of concluding solutions and convergence ratio. The results indicate that the proposed method can be treated as an effective, promising tool for parameter detection of the solar cells modules in dealing with practical cases.

AB The retrofit of urban lighting systems is often an advantageous means of achieving notable energy savings and improvements in the quality of light. User habits, expectations and lifestyle can contribute to the design of these systems, for example in deciding on the most appropriate control strategies or the light quality. The influence of such variables can be extended to the overall system performance. This paper presents a method of street lighting design based on two kinds of analysis carried out in a defined test area: measurements (by means of a monitoring study) and user preferences (by means of a survey). The results of this data analysis create the basis for the final design step. The proposed method is applied in a case study: the lighting system of the outdoor areas of the University of Palermo campus (Italy). The results show that the proposed method can be used to optimise the performance of a lighting plant in terms of energy saving and quality of light, while also taking into account the opinions of local users. Indeed, the results of the survey show that 81% of the users feel safe in test areas, 80% declare very good satisfaction with the project, and the totality of the sample would like the implementation of new features embedded in the lighting infrastructure. Expected results of energy savings in the entire campus will be about 70% with a short investment return time (3-4 years).

AB In this research, detailed characteristics of diesel spray and atomization based on marine engine scale have been studied under subcritical, transcritical and supercritical conditions. A large constant volume chamber with an inner diameter of 300 mm and a 300 pm single-nozzle injector are used to mimic the in-cylinder thermodynamic condition of marine diesel engine. Sub/trans/supercritical conditions are composed of nine cases by means of different diesel phase transition regions. Optical diagnostic measurements are conducted through backlight illumination technology and schlieren imaging technology in an inert atmosphere. The images are processed with multi-threshold technique to obtain quantitative spray parameters, such as jet and liquid penetrations, averaged lengths, liquid steady time, spray cone angles and R-parameter. Moreover, some new finding about the structure of spray under supercritical condition is also discussed. The results show that the spray liquid periphery is quite smooth and stable with shorter penetration under supercritical condition, meanwhile, the jet of spray behaves as thinner periphery near the injector nozzle region and shows lower density at downstream region. Higher ambient pressure produces a negative effect on the increase of the tip velocity and development of spray. With the transition from transcritical condition to supercritical condition, the liquid length decreases by 32 mm and there exists an obvious decrease of 35 mm from jet length to liquid length. A trade-off relationship between the jet cone angle and jet penetration is also found. Generally, this work is helpful to understand the detailed process of diesel atomization under transcritical and supercritical conditions.

AB The Forchheimer's inertial force impact is always neglected when studying the mass transfer of proton exchange membrane fuel cells in previous literatures. In this work, firstly, driving forces affecting liquid droplets on gas diffusion layer surfaces are analyzed, and it is found that the impact of Forchheimer's inertial force becomes non neglected when the Reynolds number is increased. Therefore, a two-dimensional, non-isothermal, steady-state and modified two-fluid model, which considers the Forchheimer's inertial force impact, is developed for the first time. The modified two-fluid model is validated by comparing with experimental data and conventional two fluid model results. The results indicate that the modified two-fluid model results can match the experimental data quite well under various flow rates in both the fuel cell with a straight flow channel and that with a baffled flow channel. Moreover, the liquid water saturation distribution is also studied by using the modified two-fluid model. When considering the Forchheimer's inertial force impact, comparing with the conventional two-fluid model results, liquid water saturations in flow channels, gas diffusion layers and catalyst layers are reduced by 5.69%, 5.56% and 4.22%, respectively, in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell with baffled flow channels.

AB A unitized regenerative fuel cell is a typical gas liquid two-phase system that consumes oxygen and hydrogen in a fuel cell mode and liquid water in an electrolytic cell mode. Liquid water removal is crucial for a successful cell start-up after the electrolytic cell mode ends. However, investigations on two-phase transfer mechanisms for liquid water removal are limited during mode switching. To fill this research gap, a three-dimensional two-phase full-cell model is developed to describe charges, gas mixtures and liquid water transfer corresponding to operational modes of electrolytic cell, gas purging and fuel cell. The cell is assumed to being in the isothermal state. Numerical model is analyzed by using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a software. Furthermore, experimental and simulated results are compared to validate the proposed model. Results show that more than 84.0% of pore volume is occupied with liquid water on porous layers in an electrolytic cell mode. Although pre-switching for water removal can decrease the volume fraction of liquid water within the porous layers from 0.88 to 0.50 in a short time, more time is required for liquid water being carried away under a low level of water flooding. Purging result presents diverse influences on start-up performance in a fuel cell mode. Liquid water distribution, which is similar to that in a fuel cell mode, formed in a purging mode is encouraged for promoting a quick and stable start-up in a fuel cell mode.

AB Accurate and robust modeling of the characteristic I-V curve of a photovoltaic module is essential in many applications focused on forecasting and predicting photovoltaic (PV) performance. The single diode equivalent model has been used extensively for representing the working principles of solar cells. This work presents a simple methodology for solving the single diode equation from the manufacture's datasheet parameters, by combining the Lambert-W function and an iterative procedure on the ideality factor of the diode, which has a fast convergence and robustness. The model has been assessed by comparing with experimental I-V curves measured for different modules at indoor and outdoor conditions with good results. Sensitivity analysis has been also done to indicate the possible impact of the uncertainty of the initial parameters that input the model.

ID PERFORMANCE; OPTIMIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN; ELEMENT; BLADES
AB A growing interest has been devoted to turbines with diffusers, which induce a pressure drop downstream of the turbine to accelerate the fluid in the axial direction. This effect increases the axial aero- or hydrodynamic load on the turbine powertrain, such that frictional torque presents a challenge to turbine starting. Hence, this work is concentrated on how a diffuser can affect the dissipative torque of a wind or hydrokinetic turbine, in which the increased axial load and starting torque need to be considered. The approach uses a quasi-steady Blade Element Momentum model, adapted to consider the action of a diffuser, to predict instantaneous aerodynamic torque and power. The mass-moment of inertia of the entire system is taken into account, as well as the frictional losses in the bearings. As the diffuser affects the axial load on the rotor blades, the dissipative torque can undergo relevant variations. The Stribeck effect on the starting behavior of a small wind turbine is analyzed in order to evaluate the influence of the diffuser on the minimal flow velocity necessary to start rotating the turbine. The rotational speed and power output of a shrouded hydrokinetic turbine with a 10 m diameter are computed and compared to those of a bare turbine; at steady-state, a rotational speed 20% higher than that of the bare turbine is achieved, generating about 40% more net energy despite increased powertrain losses.

AB Thermoelectric waste heat recovery systems (WHRSs) can be used appropriately to recover wasted heat from various industrial processes. In the current work, new thermodynamic modeling was developed to harvesting waste heat from an integrated system includes an externally fired gas turbine and a biomass gasifier by three thermoelectric WHRSs. The biomass system consisted a gas turbine cycle, an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and a domestic water heater were first thermodynamically modeled, and then effects of adding thermoelectric WHRSs to different locations of the system were investigated. It is observed that first law efficiency of the system (eta(1)) will become 17.11% (an increase of 0.35%) if the total output heat from the stack enters WHRSs. The efficiencies of the system can be increased from 16.76% to 17.93% by placing a WHRS on the condenser of ORC. Moreover, the operating parameters have a significant effect on the integrated system efficiency; the influence of increasing alpha(GE) on the efficiencies is in contrast to the effect of enhancing alpha(cond). In addition, an economic assessment of integrating WHRSs with the biomass gasifier integrated system is conducted and the conditions are indicated under which the proposed system is profitable. Furthermore, the results of genetic algorithm based multi-objective optimization shows that with the use of gamma(Du) = 2 and gamma(L,ORC) = 30 defined thermal efficiencies are at their optimum state.

ID DESIGN; PERFORMANCE
AB This paper proposes and implements an all-utensil domestic induction heating system, which can effectively heat utensils made by ferromagnetic conductive (FC), non-ferromagnetic conductive (NFC) and non-ferromagnetic non-conductive (NFNC) materials. The proposed system consists of a controller, a full-bridge inverter and a new sandwiched-coil structure with the primary coil located at the lower part, ferrite bars in the middle part and resonant coil in the upper part of the heater, respectively. Besides, a fixed capacitor is connected with the primary coil and a switched-capacitor array is connected with the resonant coil to ensure that the magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) can be achieved when adopting different utensils. The proposed system not only releases the current stress of the inverter but also significantly strengthens the magnetic coupling effect to boost the heating performance under a resonant frequency of 30 kHz. In the meantime, the burst firing control (BFC) is utilized to flexibly regulate the output power while retaining the maximum transfer efficiency. For exemplification, a 500 W prototype has been built for heating FC (iron), NFC (aluminum) and NFNC (ceramic) utensils with the average temperatures of 83.8, 73.1 and 76.5 degrees C, output powers of 484.4, 411.4 and 426.16 W, and transfer efficiencies of 96.9, 82.3 and 85.2% respectively. Both finite element analysis and experimentation are given to verify the validity of the proposed system.

AB This study assesses the gasification behaviour of three Victorian brown coals in CO2 using a bench - scale entrained flow reactor in terms of gas quality and carbon conversion. Two gasification processes were investigated: a) gasification of coal in a single step, b) pyrolysis of coal followed by gasification of the char in two steps. The effect of temperature (1000-1400 degrees C) and input CO2 (10-40 vol%) concentration on two gasification process was investigated. It was found that higher temperature and input CO2 concentration increased CO concentration and carbon conversion. The gasification process (direct and two-step gasification) had little effect on the overall carbon conversion but had a significant effect on the gas composition of the product gases. During two-step gasification, coal pyrolysis contributed to around 65% carbon conversion, almost all H-2 and 22-30% CO. Char gasification contributed to around 35% carbon conversion and 70-78% CO. By contrast, direct gasification generated little H2 and more CO in the product gases than two-step gasification. It was estimated that the CO was generated from coal pyrolysis (18.8-24.2%), Boudouard reaction (55.1-66.5%), and the reverse water gas shift reaction (13.1-19.3%). Regardless of direct or two-step gasification, it was found that entrained flow gasification achieved very high carbon conversion (similar to 98%) for Victorian brown coals at 1200 degrees C with around 7 s residence time for the particle size of 90-106 gm.

AB This study investigates the synergistic performance of hybrid micro-nano porous surfaces (HMNP) for Nucleate pool boiling (NBHT) and its application to thermal management of concentrated photovoltaics (CPV). A new set of HMNP surfaces was prepared by two-step method of hot powder compaction of micro-particles followed by nanoparticles coating. Three different surfaces, i.e., plain (P), microporous (MP), and hybrid micro-nano porous (HMNP) were examined for NBHT performance with de-ionized (DI) water as working fluid. In HMNP surfaces three different concentration of nanoparticles 0.0001%, 0.001%, and 0.01% were used for coating. MP showed enhanced HTC and CHF performance, which was further improved by HMNP coating with the highest performance at 0.01% concentration. Compared to P surface, the maximum increase for CHF of MP and HMNP was 1.79 and 2.5 times while the maximum increase in HTC was 1.8 and 2.33 for MP and HMNP surfaces, respectively. For the lowest applied heat flux of 110 kW/m(2), the maximum decrease in wall superheat for MP, and HMNP coating was 2.5 degrees C and 3.7 degrees C, respectively as compared to the P surface. The increase in CHF and HTC was observed to increase with an increase in the concentration of coated nanoparticles in HMNP surface. Bubble dynamics were observed by the high-speed camera and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis, and contact angle analysis were performed for P, MP and HMNP surfaces. In the end, an analytical study is performed to analyze the effect of P, MP and HMNP surface as a resulted enhancement of CPV cell performance.

AB Performance reduction of gas turbine power plants during the hot seasons has persuaded the specialists to propose different inlet air temperature reducer techniques. Accessible free heat at the exhaust of the turbine justifies the absorption chiller as a potential solution. However, based on the evaluations of present research, almost for all climate conditions a huge capacity/size/number of absorption chillers are required to reach the ISO condition (15 degrees C and RH 100% which is the design point of gas turbine) which means considerable amount of initial, operating and maintenance cost. As the M-cycle cooler (which has very simpler structure and lower costs) is able to reduce the air temperature toward the dew point temperature without adding any moisture, present research proposes an integrated cycle of M-cycle and absorption chiller (which notably reduces the whole cost of the cooling process) for said aim. In present novel cycle, the air is precooled by M-cycle toward its dew point temperature before entering to the absorption chiller which significantly reduces the required capacity of absorption chiller for the rest of the cooling process. The most amazing feature of the integrated cycle is that the condensed water from the air during the cooling process by absorption chiller can be employed as the M-cycle water consumption. For some climate conditions, M-cycle is able to provide ISO condition (or colder temperatures) without the requirement of absorption chiller. Many other outstanding results are obtained which can be used in real industrial applications.

AB This paper focuses on the design of an innovative low-cost air-based photovoltaic/thermal collector prototype, for which a novel dynamic simulation model is suitably developed in order to investigate its energy performance and economic feasibility under different operating conditions. The main novelty of this photovoltaic/thermal collector is the low-cost heat extraction system, implemented to reduce the photovoltaic cells temperature and to recover thermal energy. The prototype is tested under different operating conditions and the experimental data are used to validate the presented simulation model. The developed tool, implemented in a MatLab code, is used for analysing a suitable case study. The photovoltaic/thermal collectors are coupled to an air-to-air heat pump for space heating of a sample building. A novel performance map of such a coupled system is built with the aim of linking the heat pump coefficient of performance to both the outdoor air temperature and incident solar radiation. In addition, the system energy effectiveness and economic feasibility, compared to those of a traditional system, are assessed for the climate of 8 different European weather zones. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system, estimating primary energy savings (11.0-19.7 MWh/year corresponding to 52-80%), avoided carbon dioxide emissions (4.64-10.4 t(CO2)/year), and simple pay-back periods (3.2-4.8 years).

AB Multi-objective optimization of a hybrid building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) system and earth-air heat exchanger (EAHE) is studied. According to the position of the BIPVT and EAHE systems, two different configurations (i.e. configuration A and configuration B) are examined. In the heating mode of the configuration A, the cold outdoor air is twice preheated by passing through the EAHE and BIPVT systems. In the cooling mode of the configuration A, the hot outdoor air is precooled by flowing inside the EAHE system and the photovoltaic (PV) modules are cooled using the building exhaust air. The cooling mode of the configuration B is similar to the configuration A, while in the heating mode of the configuration B, the outdoor air first enters the BIPVT collector and then passes through the EAHE system. The annual total amount of produced energy and exergy are considered as the objective functions. The effective parameters in the optimization process include the air mass flow rate, the length, width and depth of BIPVT channel and the length and depth of EAHE system. The outcomes revealed that the annual total energy and exergy outputs of the optimum configuration A are 96448.6 kWh and 10015.5 kWh, respectively, while these values for the optimum configuration B are respectively 98537.5 and 9888.4 kWh.

AB The Annual Energy Production (AEP) estimations are crucial to analyze the potential of wind energy projects. To calculate the AEP of a wind farm, it is necessary to accurately measure the wind speed, because small errors in these measures lead to significant deviations in the wind turbine power curve. In-field wind speed is usually measured by means of cup anemometers, which are calibrated within wind tunnels. In-field ambient conditions differ from those at the laboratory, which increases the uncertainty of the wind speed measures performed at the location of the turbine. The present work is focused on analyzing the effect of the following ambient parameters on the cup anemometer behavior: temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure. In order to reach this target, experimental tests in a wind tunnel were performed, which allows minimizing the effect of the rest of influence parameters: turbulence, average flow inclination angle and flow direction. With this work it is determined how flow air viscous forces affect the cup anemometers, changing its rotation frequency. This explanation concludes that a variation on air temperature, humidity and/or pressure modifies moist air kinematic viscosity, which leads to change the friction between air and cups and, consequently, the cup anemometers rotational frequency. In most cases, the kinematic viscosity is inversely proportional to the air density and therefore, higher in-field densities, compared to those at the laboratory where the anemometer was calibrated, lead to underestimate the wind speed, and vice versa. The fact that this effect has been quantified during the calibration process is quite important, since it allows removing the influence of the environmental parameters studied; so that by modifying the calibration methodology, the accuracy of cup anemometers would be optimized. In order to clarify how the moist air kinematic viscosity influences the calibration curve, the calibration measurements of a real cup anemometer are mapped into a new dimensionless abacus, with the Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) and the Reynold's number as coordinates. The key idea is that the rotation frequency of the cup anemometer is related to both wind speed and moist air kinematic viscosity. This relation is mathematically described by the equation of a hyperbolic paraboloid surface up to a value of wind speed of 15.3 m/s.

AB A three-dimensional simulation on flow behavior and lean combustion in a hydrogen direct-injection gasoline rotary engine was implemented. The combined influence of hydrogen injection pressure (HIP) and nozzle diameter (HND) was numerically analyzed in the critical injection state. Results showed that with the increments of HIP and HND, further penetration and larger dispersion angle of jet-flow were presented. Increasing HIP led to larger jet-flow area and more jet-wall interaction, as well as greater deflection degree of hydrogen-flow after crashing upon the rotor surface. High-speed region expanded, while more jet-wall impingement occurred with the increment of HND. The spark ignited earlier and flame propagated faster as the HND modified smaller. As the HIP increased, the flame speed decreased slightly. The difference in the local Phi distribution and in-cylinder velocity field were the intrinsic mechanism of the HND impact, and the variation in the mixture concentration and TKE magnitude were the root causes of the HIP effect. The pressure and HRR traces were shifted to the downward clearly, while the peak positions were forming later as the HND extended larger. No perceptible difference in the peak positions of pressure and HRR were obtained with the HIP decrease, although pressure tended to increase along with heat release retard to be shortened. The combustion rate decreased with increments of HND and HIP, the timings of the initial consumption were delayed, and a proportional correspondence of reactants and intermediates was witnessed. The reduced NOx formation was obtained by increments of HND and HIP, and an inverse correlation can be seen between soot, CO, HC generations and NOx concentration. The scheme of 0.4 Willa HIP and 1 nun HND was the optimum configuration. Compared with a larger HND and higher HIP configuration, the peak pressure and maximum HRR were increased by 24.1% and 40.5%, and the productions of soot, CO, and HC were reduced by 55.7%, 61.5%, and 54.7%, respectively, though the NOx generation was increased to some extent. It was recommended in practice operations that the combination of lower HIP and smaller HND left a positive influence on improving the combustion characteristics of Wankel engines.

AB The automobile has become an integral part of the modern life. It, however, also triggers off a string of problems such as energy shortage and environmental pollution. As a static power generation technology, thermoelectricity has been widely used to recover the redundant exhaust heat, forming automotive exhaust thermoelectric generators (AETEGs). In this paper, a comprehensive review on AETEGs was firstly carried out from the perspective of nationality where research objects, conditions, main features and important outcomes for each study were highlighted. The feasibility of AETEGs has been demonstrated and a considerable progress has been made. However, no commercial automobile has equipped with AETEGs. Following that, the bottlenecks and challenges associated with various aspects such as material, geometry, heat transfer, space and weight, were pointed out by comparing research status and objects, and the strategies to cope with were reviewed. Finally, a research roadmap from material level, to component level and to whole device level was proposed and eleven promising research directions were refined to accelerate the application progress. In summary, there is still a long road before commercial applications of AETEGs and considerable effort should be poured into sustainedly. This review intends to guide the future study to a large extent.

AB The hydrodynamic and power capture performance of an asymmetric floating device called "Dolphin" wave energy converter (WEC) integrated with a fixed breakwater has been proposed. The operation of the floating WEC device is restricted to the vertical direction called heaving motion. In this research, the theories of heaving motion, wave energy conversion, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were studied. A numerical simulation of the CFD with the laminar model was conducted; namely, the effects of four different model shapes were investigated, distance effect between the WEC device and breakwater, WEC integrated with/without breakwater, and vorticity effect analysis using STAR-CCM + software based on the viscous flow theory in the time domain. The optimal power take-off (PTO) system was considered during the numerical calculation, including the parameters of the WEC model, which were optimized to exploit a higher efficiency by analyzing the motion response in order to obtain the response amplitude operator (RAO) and capture width ratio (CWR) values. From the RAO and vortex field analysis, the RAO value of the Dolphin WEC was exhibited better than that of the other models. A vortex method was applied to verify the CFD simulation results. From the vortex simulation, it can be clearly seen that the integration of breakwater also affected the hydrodynamic performance of the WEC. The Dolphin WEC model with breakwater integration at experimental scale was built and tested in wave tank at Harbin Engineering University under various wave conditions. The breakwater was welded with the steel plate to restrict movement. The displacement sensor and linear generator were installed on top of the WEC device during the experiment. To modify the damping in the system, the heaving motion and power generation characteristics were analyzed and electrical resistance was assumed. The displacement and power in the time domain, RAO, and CWR for different wave periods and wave heights were investigated in the experiment, where the maximum motion response and power efficiency of the WEC model were 1.57 and 0.376, respectively.

AB This manuscript presents a deep analysis of natural gas-hydrous ethanol dual-fuel combustion in a spark ignition engine with a modified compression ratio and an advanced intake valve opening strategy to promote intemal exhaust gas recirculation (iEGR). Both fuels were port-fuel injected and two different liquid fuel replacements by compressed natural gas (CNG) were tested (18 and 45% by energy). Combustion, performance and pollutant emissions were investigated under stoichiometric air-fuel conditions at 4 bar of net indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and 1800 rpm. Results show that dual-fuel mode improves fuel conversion efficiency when compared to CNG-only operation, due to lower carbon monoxide (CO) and unburnt hydrocarbons (HCs) emissions as well as to a better combustion phasing. The use of iEGR, despite deteriorating the combustion process as expected (ignition delay, combustion duration and combustion stability), improves efficiency because of a decrease in pumping losses and wall heat transfer, as well as pollutant emissions reduction. Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions increase with dual-fuel operation. However, the influence of iEGR was found to be more significant under dual-fuel mode than under single-fuel operation, with NOx reductions of up to 70% and fuel conversion efficiency improvements of around 2.5%.

AB Combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) is a promising energy supply technology which is widely installed in buildings due to its feasibility from techno-economic, performance and environmental points of view. In present paper, a novel cogeneration system based on compressed air energy storage (CAES), organic rankine cycle (ORC) and hybrid compression-absorption refrigeration cycle is proposed. The main objective of the proposed system is to improve the efficiency of the CAES system by providing cooling capacity from the rest of hot gases in turbine exhaust through employing an ORC driven refrigeration system. Also, the effect of the maximum to minimum pressure ratio of CAES vessel as a critical parameter on CAES volume and round trip efficiency (RTE) has been scrutinized. Using the environmentally-friendly compression-absorption refrigeration system, high temperature thermal energy storage (HTES) and R407C as the organic working fluid decrease fossil fuel consumption and make the proposed system fully environmentally-friendly. The results indicate that 2280 kW electrical energy and 416.7 kW cooling capacity are simultaneously generated during peak period. As a result, with 13.15% RTE enhancement in comparison to the individual CAES system, it reaches to 65.15% based on the proposed modification. Also, the results show that the overall exergy efficiency and total exergy destruction of the components are 49.17% and 1419 kW, in which the pressure regulating valve and the air turbine have the highest irreversibility and exergy destruction.

AB Displacement ventilation (DV) combined with liquid desiccant membrane cooled ceiling (LDMC-C) is an efficient Heating, ventilation and Air conditioning (HVAC) system. However, the LDMC-C/DV has limited performance in office spaces located in hot and humid climates or characterized by high internal latent loads due to the inability to control the humidity. This study proposes a cascaded liquid desiccant system in which the liquid desiccant flow exiting the LDMC-C is directed into a liquid desiccant heat and mass exchanger in the DV supply duct to control the humidity in the space and conserve energy. To achieve this goal, an integrated model for different components of the cascaded liquid desiccant system is developed to predict the comfort level and the air quality inside the space as well as the energy consumption of the system. The model was validated experimentally in a climatic chamber. The validated integrated system model was applied to a case study to assess the effectiveness of the system in hot and humid climate. Two configurations of the LDMC-C and mass exchanger were simulated and found to provide acceptable humidity for comfort in the occupied zone of the space. Moreover, the cascaded system cooling and heating energy were found lower by 21.25% and 16.23% respectively in August when compared to a LDMC-C/DV, and to DV membrane exchanger system with different configuration. The cooling and heating energies were also lower in the cascaded system compared to a LDMC-C/DV while using conventional supply air dehumidification method.

AB To harvest the relatively high wavelength sunlight, a novel hybrid system coupling a thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle to a dye-sensitized solar cell is proposed. Efficiencies and power outputs of dye-sensitized solar cell and thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle are calculated, and the mathematical relationship between the electric current of thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle and the working current density of dye-sensitized solar cell is deduced. The power output and efficiency of the hybrid system are also derived considering multiple irreversible losses. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid system will be assessed by comparing the performances between the hybrid system and the single dye-sensitized solar cell. Numerical calculations show that the maximum efficiency and power density of the hybrid system allow 32.04% and 32.18% greater than that of the single dye-sensitized solar cell, respectively. Comprehensive parametric studies are undertaken to examine the dependences of the hybrid system performance on some operating conditions and microstructure parameters, including electrode porosity, photoelectron absorption coefficient, Schottky barrier, film thickness and internal resistance of thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle. The derived results may offer new insights into design and optimization of such an actual hybrid system.

AB One modern method of lowering building energy use is heat exchange between outgoing and incoming air. Exhaust air moisture (partly) condenses in the heat exchanger, giving liquid water to be removed. With low absolute humidity of inlet air especially at low outdoor temperatures, a significant drying effect results for the air inside the building. Increasing air humidity by, for example, spraying water or increasing watering of plants will give an energy penalty. This paper presents an analysis of the energy efficiency (recovered versus input exergy) of a modem house equipped an exhaust air heat recovery system and external heating supplied by a geothermal heat pump. Indoor temperature is 22 degrees C and relative humidity is 50 or 30%. Temperature and humidity of inlet air and ventilation flow rates are variable and the effects on power use by the heat pump are assessed. Results show that without moisture recirculation a water loss up to 1 kg/h from the building may occur. Several kWh of electricity may be consumed daily by a (geothermal) heat pump supplying heat depending on outdoor temperature, and indoor and outdoor air humidity. Besides water consumption, this may imply 10-15% of total electricity use.

AB Carbohydrate-rich and fast-growing seaweeds such as the S. japonica species are increasingly becoming the 3rd generation biomass of choice. Environmentally friendly as well as economically sound processes for biofuel production are essential if the benefits of these novel marine feedstocks are to be harnessed. This study features an experiment-based process design that combines a fluidized bed fast pyrolysis reactor system, non-intensive pretreatment, and a Bryton power cycle in an, energy-wise, nearly self-sustainable system, considerably reducing the utilization of fossil fuel-derived utilities. Complex liquid products of pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading were modeled using a specialized software ensuring strict adherence to experimental data, hence retaining a highly realistic simulation. Results of comprehensive techno-economic and market uncertainty assessments have shown a capital investment of 170 mil. USD, and a minimum selling price range of 1.534-1.852 USD/L. When compared to traditional oil and gas extraction and refining processes, the designed process yielded a 12.8-fold reduction of the total CO2 emitted, indicating a superior process in terms of environmental sustainability.

AB The paper presents a theoretical analysis of advanced gas-turbine cycles. Specifically, three cycles are investigated, that is the intercooled, the reheat, and the intercooled and reheat cycles. The internal irreversibilities, which characterise the compression and expansion processes, are taken into account through the polytropic efficiencies of the compressors and turbines.
   New analytical formulations for the overall and intermediate pressure-ratios which maximise the net work of the three aforementioned cycles are proposed along with an order relation between these optimum pressure ratios. Moreover, the thermal efficiency of these cycles is also analysed providing, among other findings, the ranges of the intermediate pressure-ratios returning a benefit in the thermal efficiency in comparison with the simple cycle. Finally, for the sole intercooled and reheat cycle, a novel analytical expression for the maximum point of the thermal efficiency is given. It is also shown that, for the intercooled and reheat cycle, there is a unique value of the overall pressure-ratio which simultaneously maximises the net work and the thermal efficiency.
   To give some quantitative information, consider a maximum to minimum cycle-temperature ratio equal to 1573/300 and a compressor (resp. turbine) polytropic-efficiency equal to 0.8 (resp. 0.88). The net work and the thermal efficiency are maximised by a set of overall pressure-ratios obeying an order relation. The simple, the reheat, the intercooled, and the intercooled and reheat cycles reach the maximum net-work (resp. thermal efficiency) for increasing values of the overall pressure-ratio, that is 8.550 (resp. 18.260), 14.950 (resp. 25.039), 20.846 (resp. 39.984), and 73.109 (resp. 73.109). The reheat cycle achieves a 34.899% (rasp. 6.077%) gain in the net work (resp. thermal efficiency), while the intercooled cycle returns a 31.477% (resp. 15.970%) increment. The maximum net-work of the intercooled and reheat cycle exactly doubles that of the simple cycle. Finally, the maximum thermal efficiency of the intercooled and reheat cycle yields a 24.966% improvement in comparison with the simple one.

AB The variable reluctance principle can be used to convert rotational kinetic energy into electrical energy, creating a Variable Reluctance Energy Harvester (VREH) based on electromagnetic induction. This can be used to implement self-sustaining wireless sensors in rotating applications. In this paper, we present and investigate a novel design of a VREH with high volumetric power density that targets low-speed rotating applications. The design uses an m-shaped pole-piece and two opposing magnets. We theoretically analyze key design parameters that influence the VREH's output power, and relate these parameters to geometrical design factors of the proposed structure. Key design factors include the coil height, the permanent magnet height and the tooth height. A method based on numerical simulations is introduced, enabling to determine the optimal geometrical dimensions of the proposed structure under given size-constraints. The results demonstrate that the method leads to optimal structure configurations, which has been evaluated for different cases and is verified experimentally. Good agreement between numerical simulations and experiments are reported with deviations in output power estimation below 3%. The optimized m-shaped VREH, moreover, provides output power levels sufficient for wireless sensor operation, even in low-speed rotating applications.

In this study, the advantages of transcritical CO2 power cycle for low temperature heat sources are explored from a thermo-economic viewpoint. The performances of four different transcritical CO2 power cycles are evaluated theoretically and then compared with an ORC and a Kalina cycle. First, a mathematical model is established to estimate the thermodynamic and economic performances of the power cycles including a basic cycle, a recuperated cycle, a regenerative cycle with an open-feed heater, and a cycle with a reheater. Printed circuit heat exchangers are used for the evaporators and air-cooled heat exchangers are adopted for the condensers. Aspen EDR is used to obtain the areas of the air-cooled condensers and the overall thermo-economic performance is determined by Matlab. Then, one suitable cycle is selected and compared with the ORC and the Kalina cycle for a low-temperature heat source. The results indicate that the cycle with a reheater is preferable among the four transcritical CO2 cycles. Compared with the ORC and the Kalina cycle, the net power output of the transcritical CO2 cycle is the largest and the economic performance is between the Kalina cycle and the ORC. However, CO2 is cheaper, more environmentally-friendly, and safer than organic fluids. Therefore, from a thermo-economic viewpoint, transcritical CO2 power cycle is competent with ORC for low-temperature heat sources.

AB Hydraulic excavators are essential excavation machines, with more than 3.8 million sets in use in the mining, and engineering and architectural engineering construction fields. However, during the working process, a large amount of gravitational potential energy is wasted, causing low energy efficiency and poor emissions. Taking a large-scale excavator as an example, during a certain 90 degrees excavation process, the gravitational potential energy wastage of the working device is approximately 975.1 kJ, which amounts to at least 20% of the energy consumption of the entire machine, causing significant energy waste and serious pollution. And, during the boom lowering process, the changing rate of potential energy is about 406.4 kW. In order to improve the energy efficiency of hydraulic excavators, the recovery of this huge energy that changes rapidly with low cost and high efficiency is a big problem that must be solved. This paper proposes a gravitational potential energy recovery scheme with an energy conversion cylinder and a hydraulic accumulator. Using this scheme, the gravitational potential energy of the working device can be stored and reused directly, without increasing the cost and install power of the machine largely. In the study, first, the system parameters are designed, following which the multidisciplinary dynamic model of the hydraulic excavator is established. The influence of the accumulator parameters on the energy recovery ratio is studied based on the model. The results demonstrate that with the newly designed system more than 75.9% of the gravitational potential energy can be stored in the accumulator during the lowering process. Moreover, during a certain lifting process, the input energy to the pump can be reduced by 52%. On this basis, a 76 the hydraulic excavator test system is constructed using the above principle. The experimental results match strongly with the co-simulation results. The energy consumption can be reduced to approximately 238 kJ during a certain 90 excavation cycle, and the system can reduce the carbon dioxide emissions by 28088.4 kg per year. The energy-saving and emission-reduction effects are remarkable; furthermore, this principle can directly be applied to other lifting machines.

AB In this study, a detailed 1D simulation model of the hydrogen-enriched natural gas SI engine was built according to realistic engine layout in the lab with practical boundary conditions, and validated against the experimental data. Four different types of EGR systems were comprehensively investigated, including a low-pressure (LP) EGR, a high-pressure (HP) EGR, their combinations, and an internal EGR, using the validated 1D simulation model of the hydrogen-enriched natural gas SI engine for their combustion, performance, and emissions characteristics. The results indicated that the peak combustion pressure of the in-cylinder pressure decreased with increase in EGR ratio either using the HP, LP, or combined HP-LP systems. The NOx emissions with the HP EGR were observed to be lowest of all types of EGR systems. Combined the 10% HP EGR ratio with the 5% LP EGR ratio (total 15% EGR ratio) was predicted to achieve the highest indicated thermal efficiency compared with other EGR strategies. As for the internal EGR, the peak combustion pressure and the heat release rate slightly increased with decrease in the valve overlap. Moreover, the indicated thermal efficiency firstly increased with decrease in overlap and then slightly declined. The internal EGR was mainly determined by the timing of the exhaust valve closing; However, it was not the only influence factor. The positive and negative waves in the intake and exhaust systems also played a crucial role in the gas exchange process and volumetric efficiency.

AB Gas-To-Wire is a solution for remote offshore oil-gas fields with high gas-oil ratio and high carbon dioxide content, as it requires minimum natural gas upgrade and is feasible for long-distance transportation. Additionally, combining offshore Gas-To-Wire with carbon capture enables abatement of emissions while providing revenues from enhanced oil recovery. This work investigated offshore Gas-To-Wire comprising processing of natural gas with high carbon dioxide content, power generation, post-combustion carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery. Supersonic separator is proposed for three applications: fuel-gas conditioning, fuel-gas decarbonation and pioneering dehydration of supercritical carbon dioxide. Economic analysis, including offshore rig and electricity transmission, results in positive Net Present Value with 20% of return-on-investment, besides a Levelized Cost of Energy comparable to onshore power plants with carbon capture and storage. Sensitivity analysis shows high impact of electricity-price and oil recovery yield on profitability, as well as better economic performance when carbon dioxide is not removed from fuel-gas; i.e., all carbon capture should be post combustion capture. Thus, despite effectiveness of supersonic separator for fuel-gas decarbonation, the 612 MW optimized Gas-To-Wire with carbon capture plant should have 100% of carbon removal via post-combustion, resulting in 38.3% return-on-investment and even better Levelized Cost of Energy similar to onshore power plants without carbon capture.

AB In this research, a three-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed for glass-tedlar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) air collector incorporating thermoelectric cooler (TEC). The ANN model is used for estimating the fluctuating outputs of the glass-tedlar PVT-TEC air collector, i.e. thermal energy gain, electrical energy gain, overall thermal energy gain and overall exergy gain, as a result of intermittent and varying weather conditions. The traditional modelling techniques, used for predicting the output performances of a PVT system, rely on analysis of complex relationships between different components of PVT collector, solution of differential equations and several design parameters. ANN model, however, aids in approximating the outputs by learning through training examples and hence, does not involve complex analysis and calculations. The developed ANN model is based on global solar radiation, diffuse solar radiation and ambient temperature, as inputs. Further, the outputs of glass-tedlar PVT-TEC air collector [Case are compared against glass-glass PVT-TEC air collector [Case II], using ANN model. The monthly and annual outputs of glass-tedlar PVT-TEC air collector [Case I] have been estimated for New Delhi, India. Also, a comparison between the annual results of Case I and Case II, obtained using ANN model, has been presented.

AB This article presents both an original contribution and a comprehensive technical review of the existing methods of "energy-ecologic efficiency" and "ecological efficiency". As an original contribution, this work aims at investigating for the first time, through the above-mentioned approaches, power plants fueled by municipal solid waste and hybrids with natural gas. A novel strategy is proposed to solve the main flaws of the existing methods and allow the evaluation of multi-fuel plants in a more practical way. The strategy allows to quantify through a single-score indicator the human health toxicity and climate change potential along with resource depletion due to fuel misuse. It has the advantage of being simple and applicable to any thermal system, allowing quick comparisons between different sources. The major contributions of this work are: (i) to perform a critical analysis, pointing out nuances and limitations of the investigated techniques; (ii) to evaluate systems fueled by urban waste, ranking them among fossil and renewable sources including biomass, biofuel and natural gas; (iii) to study the influence of emission abatement and biogenic carbon offset due to biomass regrowth regarding waste fired plants. As unique findings of this research, are shown the advantages of using urban waste as fuel integrated to gas turbines in combined cycles as an alternative to conventional single-fueled waste-to-energy plants, namely: (i) hybrid plants perform 12-24% better than single-fueled plants; (ii) the only way a single fueled plant can overcome a hybrid plant is if it performs co-generation with a thermal efficiency 27% superior.

AB A novel hybrid battery thermal management system, combining air-forced convection with phase change material, is proposed. The effectiveness of the system is proved experimentally. The maximum temperature difference and the maximum temperature are controlled within the optimum range in the proposed thermal management system even though the dynamic charge/discharge current rate is 4 C rate. Meanwhile, the thermal performance is also compared under the passive and active strategy. The result shows that the thermal performance under the active mode is obviously superior to that under the passive mode. Comparing with the passive mode, the maximum temperature difference and the maximum temperature in the active mode are reduced 1.2 degrees C and 16 degrees C under 3 C rate, respectively. Moreover, the mathematical model, based on the three dimension heat transfer model coupled with the electrochemical model, is carried out and then validated with experimental data. Taking advantage of the mathematical model, the space of designed structures is further optimized.

AB A new configuration of a photovoltaic module and a solar thermoelectric generator in a hybrid system integrated with a microchannel heat sink has been developed. The photovoltaic module and the solar thermoelectric generator sandwich the microchannel heat sink, as they are exposed to concentrated solar radiation. This newly developed hybrid system is compared to that with a conventional configuration in which an ordinary thermoelectric generator is attached directly to the rear surface of the concentrator photovoltaic module. To evaluate the performance of the new system in comparison to the conventional one, an all-inclusive three-dimensional thermo-fluid-thermoelectric model has been developed. This model is numerically simulated and is validated with both experimental and numerical results. The findings of this study show that the new system generates more output power and can be operated at higher concentration ratios with even lower average solar cell temperatures than the conventional system. In the new configuration, the average solar cell temperature is approximately 77 degrees C and the total electrical output power is approximately 3.2 kW/m(2) at a solar concentration ratio of 20 suns. However, the maximum possible working concentration ratio for the conventional design is 10 suns, where the solar cell temperature approaches the highest tolerable temperature of approximately 90 degrees C. Moreover, the total electrical output power is approximately 1.2 kW/m(2). Furthermore, it is found that at CR_PV = 20, the rate of the produced thermal energy is approximately 12 kW/m(2), for the conventional design while the new design achieves 15, 22, and 30 kW/m(2) for CR_STEG of 1, 10, and 20, respectively. These findings have greatly aided in identifying a new design that achieves the highest performance under concentrated solar irradiance.

AB A direct evaporator for a high temperature organic Rankine cycle (ORC) plant with toluene as a working fluid is designed and tested. The exhaust gas from a 800 kWe combined heat and power plant is cooled on the shell side of the present heat exchanger, while the working fluid is heated and evaporated within eight helically coiled tubes, constituting a tube bundle. A method to obtain optimal design parameters for this type of heat exchanger is presented, considering the heat source, the ORC and the available space at the test site. After manufacturing, the apparatus is tested to validate the design procedure, focusing on the employed heat transfer and pressure loss correlations on the shell side. It is shown that the predicted values of the overall heat transfer coefficient and the shell side Nusselt number are in good agreement with experimental data, showing a maximum deviation of 5.5%. The measured shell side pressure loss is slightly higher than the predicted value, indicating that the correlation underestimates the pressure loss coefficient by up to 7% at low Reynolds numbers, but has a good accuracy at higher Reynolds numbers. It is observed that it is essential to adjust the mass flow rate of the working fluid in each coil to obtain a homogenous vapor quality. A reliable operation of the direct evaporator with a maximum heat flow of 225 kW is shown.

AB Fumonisin B1 (FB1), the most toxic member of fumonisins, is one of the most common mycotoxins contaminating feed and food. It has been shown to produce pleiotropic toxicities in animals including neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, and with highly potential impact on human health. Proposed mechanisms include disruption of sphingolipid metabolism, induction of oxidative stress, activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and MAPKs, modulation of autophagy and alteration of DNA methylation. These mechanistic findings provide the theoretical basis for effectively managing FB1-induced adverse health effects. In this review, we will summarize the present understanding of the molecular basis underlying FB1-mediated toxicities, discuss the feasibility of developing mechanism-based approach to prevent FB1-induced toxicities, and suggest the issues that need to be addressed in the future in the field of FB1 toxicity-related studies.

AB This study evaluated cellular and molecular effects of radicicol, a heat shock protein (HSP) inducer, on the regeneration of skeletal muscle injured by crotoxin, the main toxin isolated from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom. Regenerating muscles treated with radicicol had decreased NF-kB activation. Differentiating myoblasts treated with radicicol showed reduced number of NF-kB positive nuclei and increased fusion index. The results suggest that radicicol enhances regeneration of muscle by attenuating NF-kB activation and increasing myogenic differentiation.

AB The present work reports the isolation, characterization and the complete sequence of a phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) present in the skin secretion of Pithecopus azureus. Among several peptides and small proteins previously described by our group from some species belonging to this amphibian genus (formerly named Phyllomedusa), a 15 kDa N-glycosylated protein showing PLA(2) activity was purified, assayed, sequenced and named Pa-PLA(2) . The Pithecopus azureus skin phospholipase A(2) polypeptide chain is composed by 125 amino acid residues linked by seven disulfide bonds and two N-glycosylated sites (N67 and N108). The Pa-PLA(2) enzymatic activity was qualitatively evaluated and compared to classical viperid PLA(2) showing that both, native and deglycosylated PaPLA(2) forms, are catalytically functional. The tridimensional molecular model of Pa-PLA(2) indicates that the observed glycan moieties are suggestively placed far from the active site of that enzyme and therefore having little or no significant role on the direct interaction of the Pa-PLA(2) catalytic pocket and its substrates.

AB Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are potent neurotoxins and are the causative agent of botulism, as well as valuable pharmaceuticals. BoNTs are divided into seven serotypes that comprise over 40 reported subtypes. BoNT/A1 and BoNT/B1 are currently the only subtypes approved for pharmaceutical use in the USA. While several other BoNT subtypes including BoNT/A2 and/A6 have been proposed as promising pharmaceuticals, detailed characterization using in vivo assays are essential to determine their pharmaceutical characteristics compared to the currently used BoNT/A1 and/B1. Several methods for studying BoNTs in mice are being used, but no objective and quantitative assay for assessment of functional outcomes after injection has been described. Here we describe the use of CatWalk XT as a new analytical tool for the objective and quantitative analysis of the paralytic effect after local intramuscular injection of BoNT subtypes Al, A2, A6, and B1. Catwalk is a sophisticated gait and locomotion analysis system that quantitatively analyzes a rodent's paw print dimensions and footfall patterns while traversing a glass plate during unforced walk. Significant changes were observed in several gait parameters in mice after local intramuscular injection of all tested BoNT subtypes, however, no changes were observed in mice injected intraperitoneally with the same BoNTs. While a clear difference in time to peak paralysis was observed between BoNT/A1 and/B1, injection of all four toxins resulted in a deficit in the injected limb with the other limbs functionally compensating and with no qualitative differences between the four BoNT subtypes. The presented data demonstrate the utility of CatWalk as a tool for functional outcomes after local BoNT injection through its ability to collect large amounts of quantitative data and objectively analyze sensitive changes in static and dynamic gait parameters.

AB The low molecular mass fraction from Bothrops jararaca snake venom contains proline-rich peptides (Bj-PROs), also known as bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs), which were described as neuroprotective against H2O2 induced oxidative stress. Recently, we reported that the neuroprotective action of Bj-PRO-10c (< ENWPHPQ-IPP) is a result of an increase in the expression and activity of argininosuccinate synthase (AsS), thereby improving increase L-arginine synthesis. It is proposed that formation agmatine and polyamines from L-arginine metabolism are neuroprotective, reducing lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane. In the present study, Bj-PRO-5a (< EKWAP), Bj-PRO-7a (< EDGPIPP), Bj-PRO-11e (< EARPPHPPIPP), and Bj-PRO-AP (< EARPPHPPIPPAP) - with different structure-activities, in particular on AsS expression and activity - were selected to study their protective properties on H2O2-induced oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells. Bj-PROs tested were neuroprotective, but Bj-PRO-5a and Bj-PRO-7a increased cell viability by more than 85% in the presence of H2O2 (450 mu M) and reduced the oxidative stress markers. AsS, iNOS, and NF-KB expressions were not involved in the neuroprotective mechanism for both peptides, in contrast to Bj-PRO-10c, as reported in the literature. Bj-PRO-5a is a neuroprotector peptide that decreases ROS production, NO levels lipid peroxidation, and changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability caused by H2O2 exposition. The neuroprotective property of Bj-PRO-7a against H2O2 is also related to decreased ROS production and lipid peroxidation but without altering NO levels. These results show that the protective effects of different Bj-PROs against oxidative stress can be explained by distinct mechanisms independent of an increase in L-arginine bioavailability arising from AsS activity. Further studies are now needed to reveal the details of the neuroprotective mechanisms exerted by Bj-PROs.

AB This study focused on the detection and quantification of eight cyanotoxins in water samples in three reservoirs located in the eastern department of Antioquia, Colombia. The reservoirs are a source of water supply and hydroelectricity, and also generate economic activities in fishing and recreation. Between May 2015 and October 2016, 8 samplings were carried out at times of high temperatures, which ranged from 20 to 29 degrees C. This period was selected because of a significant or strong El Nino phenomenon, according to the World Meteorological Organization. For the study, 270 integrated samples were taken from the photic zone (PZ) and the surface of the reservoirs, at each of the three sampling points. The samples were analyzed by the analytical technique of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC MS/MS). The quantification performed for six microcystins (MCs), a nodularin (NOD) and a cylindrospermopsin (CYN), showed positive results well above 1 mu g L-1. In the water of the Abreo Malpaso and Penol reservoirs, microcystin-LR (MC-LR), microcystin-YR (MC-YR) and [D-Asp(3),(E)-Dhb(7)]- microcystin-RR toxins were detected at levels of considerable concentration, especially between May and September 2015, when there was no rainfall in this region. In the Playas reservoir, positive results for [D-Asp(3),(E)-Dhb(7)]-MC-RR were detected from May to November 2015, with the highest concentrations being reached in dry season. The temperatures reached and the changes in climatic conditions witnessed during the monitoring period of this study were important factors in the production of cyanotoxins. This was evidenced in this work by the high concentrations of detected cyanotoxins and their absence in periods of rain, as happened from the second quarter of 2016 until the end of the study in October. This is the first study of the detection and quantification of cyanotoxins in tropical reservoirs of northeastern Colombia using the UHPLC MS/MS analytical technique, which allowed the toxins to be unequivocally detected and confirmed. A method was developed and validated, proving to be sensitive, reproducible and accurate. For each of the toxins (microcystin-LR (MC-LR), microcystin-RR (MC-RR), microcystin-YR (MCYR), [13-Asp(3),(E)-Dhb(7)]- microcystin-RR, microcystin-LW (MC-LW), microcystin-LF (MC-LF), nodularin (NOD) and cylindrospermopsina (CYN)) the correlation coefficients (R-2) were in a range between 0.9907 and 0.9999. Verification of the accuracy of the method was performed through a calibration curve in solvent. The recovery percentages of the accuracy and precision tests of the method for low level, medium level and high level were in a range between 64% and 115% for all the cyanotoxins. The validation of the cyanotoxin method shows that it is possible to detect them individually in natural water with a quantification limit (LOQ) of approximately 0.05 mu g L-1.

AB Abrin toxin is one of the most potent and deadly plant toxin obtained from the seeds of Abrus precatorious. It is more toxic than ricin which is classified as Schedule 1 agent by OPCW and Category B bioterrorism agent by Centre for Disease Control (CDC). Dose dependent acute toxicity of abrin is still a matter of investigation. The present study was carried out to assess the toxicity of abrin from sub lethal to supralethal doses (0.5X, 1X, 2X and 5XLD(50)) after intraperitoneal administration. After 8 and 24h of abrin exposure, hematological, biochemical, inflammatory and oxidative stress associated parameters were analyzed. Liver histology was also done to analyze the effect of abrin. Abrin exerts its toxicity in a dose and time dependent manner. Increases in neutrophil counts, lipid peroxidation with decreased lymphocyte counts, are the initiating factor irrespective of time and dose. At higher doses of abrin there was a decrease in hemoglobin level and RBC count which is reflected by increased levels of serum ammonia and bilirubin. Neutrophil infiltration in the liver and lipid peroxidation cause liver toxicity (increased production of ALT and ALP); oxidative stress (depletion of GSH and total antioxidant status); inflammation (increased production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma). Further, at higher doses of abrin, intensity of oxidative stress, inflammation and liver toxicity are more pronounced which may have been maintained by the self-sustaining loop of toxicity leading to death of the animals.

AB Wild parsnip (Pastinaca saliva) has been associated with livestock and human photosensitization. An investigation of a natural occurrence of photosensitization of grazing horses identified wild parsnip as a possible cause. HPLC-MS and MS/MS analysis of this plant identified five furanocoumarins i.e., xanthotoxin, bergapten, isopimpinellin, imperatorin and a putative methoxyimperatorin. Goats fed this wild parsnip were largely unaffected. Xanthotoxin was not detected in the serum of parsnip-fed goats or in the serum of goats dosed orally or intravenous with purified xanthotoxin. Cutaneous application produced severe photodermatitis in goats and a horse consistent with topical exposure as the likely route to produce wild parsnip-induced photosensitivity. Wild parsnip-induced superficial necrotizing dermatitis was consistent with photodermatitis with no evidence of other allergic or inflammatory components.

AB Snakebite envenoming is a devastating Neglected Tropical Disease, the treatment of which has seen relatively little innovation since the invention of antivenom serotherapy in 1894. Current antivenoms have been and continue to be invaluable in saving thousands of lives. However, these medicines are associated with a number of drawbacks pertaining to availability, safety, and efficacy. Fortunately, with the advent of novel methodologies, such as antibody discovery technologies, high-throughput drug discovery approaches, and improved methods for protein engineering, we are starting to see scientific advances in the field. This review presents relevant engineering and design considerations for exploiting these methodologies to develop next-generation antivenoms with improved safety, efficacy, and affordability. The pros and cons of different treatment modalities are discussed with regards to immunogenicity, the suitability of preclinical efficacy assays, availability of discovery methods, economic viability of production schemes, and possible regulatory approval paths.

AB To understand phycotoxin contamination in shellfish in the sub-Arctic and Arctic areas, scanning for the presence of 13 hydrophilic and lipophilic toxin components each was by liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry analysis in shellfish samples collected from the Northern Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea in 2014. The results showed that shellfish collected in both areas werecontaminated to different extents. Saxitoxin (STX), decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and decarbamoylneosaxitoxin (dcNEO) were the most frequently detected hydrophilic components, with maximum concentrations of 90.1 mu g/kg, 112.25 mu g/kg and 23.09 mu g/kg, respectively. Although gonyautoxins (GTXs) were only detected in 3 samples, they were the main contributors to overall toxicity of high-latitude samples, especially GTX1. For lipophilic toxins, spirolide-1 (SPX1) and yessotoxin (YTX) were present in all samples at low levels (< 7 mu g/kg and < 50 mu g/kg, respectively). Only 5 samples showed evidence of okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2) at low concentrations, ranging from 0.42 mu g/kg to 7.23 mu g/kg and 3.03 mu g/kg to 30.59 mu g/kg, respectively. Notably, a high level of pectenotoxin-1 (PTX-1) at 467.40 mu g/kg was found in the shellfish collected at the northernmost station, exceeding the safety regulation standard by nearly 3 times. For both lipophilic and hydrophilic toxins, contamination in shellfish in the sub-Arctic and the Arctic area may be much more widespread and severe than was previously thought. This study highlighted the need to monitor toxins in a wider variety of shellfish, especially economic or commercial species, and across a wider range of sub-Arctic and Arctic waters, as well as the potential sources of these toxins.

ID SAW-SCALED VIPER; EAST
AB Background Echis coloratus (Burton Carpet viper), a highly venomous snake belonging to the family Viperidae, is responsible for a large proportion of the venomous snakebites in Israel and Palestinian Authority. Procoagulant enzymes are present in Echis coloratus venom and significant coagulopathy is typical after envenomation. Here we report a case of envenomation by Echis coloratus that involved severe coagulopathy as the main systemic manifestation with severe bleeding after fasciotomy.
   Case details: A 3-year-old boy was admitted to our pediatric critical care unit after a snakebite to his left hand, 2-3 hours post-bite. Based on the possibility of compartment syndrome, a fasciotomy was performed before administration of antivenom. At our hospital, he had altered prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), with low fibrinogen levels. The snake responsible for the bite was later identified as a 38-cm long Echis coloratus. Five vials of Israeli monovalent antivenom were subsequently administered with step-wise improvement in hematological abnormalities. Other treatments included massive blood products transfusion (packed RBC, FFP, cryoprecipitate, PLT), inotropes and ventilatory support. After a prolonged hospital course the patient had a positive outcome.

AB Microcystins (MCs) are hepatotoxic and potentially carcinogenic cyanotoxins. They exhibit high structural variability, with nearly 250 variants described to date. This variability can result in incomplete detection of MC variants during lake surveys due to the frequent use of targeted analytical methods and a lack of standards available for identification and quantitation. In this study, Lake Uluabat in Turkey was sampled during the summer of 2015. Phylogenetic analysis of the environmental mcyA sequences suggested Microcystis spp. were the major MC contributors. A combination of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), liquid chromatography with UV detection and mass spectrometry (LC-UV-MS), and a novel liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method, together with thiol and periodate reactivity, revealed more than 36 MC variants in the lake samples and a strain of M. aeruginosa (AQUAMEB-24) isolated from Lake Uluabat. Only MCs containing arginine at position-4 were detected in the culture, while MC-LA, -LY, -LW and -LF were also detected in the lake samples, suggesting the presence of other MC producers in the lake. The previously unreported MCs MC-(H2)YR (dihydrotyrosine at position-2) (17), [epoxyAdda(5)]MC-LR, [DMAdda(5)]MC-RR (1) and [Mser(7)]MC-RR (8) were detected in the culture and/or field samples. This study is a good example of how commonly used targeted LC-MS methods can underestimate the diversity of MCs in freshwater lakes and cyanobacteria cultures and how untargeted LC-MS methods can be used to comprehensively assess MC diversity present in a new system.

AB Cobra venom factor (CVF) is the complement-activating protein in cobra venom. CVF is a structural and functional analog of complement component C3. CVF, like C3b, forms a convertase with factor B. This bimolecular complex CVF,Bb is an enzyme that cleaves C3 and C5. However, CVF,Bb exhibits significantly different functional properties from C3b,Bb. The CVF,Bb convertase is physico-chemically very stable, and completely resistant to an activation by Factors H and I. These two properties, in contrast to C3b,Bb, allow continuous activation of C3 and C5, and complement depletion in serum. In order to understand the structural basis for the functional differences between CVF and C3, we have created several hybrid proteins of CVF and human C3. Here we report that replacing the C-terminal 168 amino acid residues of human C3 with the corresponding residues from CVF results in a hybrid protein (HC3-1496) which is essentially a human C3 derivative exhibiting the functional properties of CVF. This result demonstrates that the important structures for the CVF-specific functions reside within the C-terminal 168 amino acid residues of CVF. We further demonstrate that reverting the 46 C-terminal CVF residues of HC3-1496 to human C3 sequence results in a hybrid protein (HC3-1496/1617) that exhibits a physico-chemically unstable convertase with only residual complement depleting activity. This result demonstrates that most, but not all, structural requirements for CVF activity reside within the 46 C-terminal amino acid residues. We also investigated the potential role of position 1633, which is an acidic residue in human C3 (glutamic acid) but a basic amino acid residue (histidine) in CVF. However, the charge at position 1633 appears to be of no functional relevance. Exchanging the neutral amino acids present in CVF at positions 1499 and 1501 with the two charged amino acids at these positions in human C3 (aspartic acid and lysine) resulted in a hybrid protein that exhibited significantly slower convertase formation although both binding to Factor B and C3 cleavage was not affected, demonstrating that the charged amino acid residues at these two positions interfere with the formation of the convertase. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that hybrid proteins of human C3 and CVF present valuable tools to identify functionally important amino acid residues in CVF.

AB Marine isolates such as palytoxin (PTX) are of concern within the Caribbean region due to their toxicity. PTX for example has been described as a one of the most known potent marine toxins, known to prevent predation from larger species (e.g. vertebrates) as well as the prevention of being overgrown from other coral species. PTX is a polyhydroxylated polyether toxin with a very large and complex chemical structure that possesses both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties. Previous acute toxicity tests using brine shrimp (Artemia salina) and PTX extract had shown it to be moderately toxic. In humans, PTX has been credited to be responsible for extreme symptoms such anaphylactic shock, rapid cardiac failure and eventual death occurring within minutes. Extrapolation for human dose ranges has therefore been suggested to be between 2.3 and 31.5 mu g. This study isolates a potentially PTX-enriched extract from Palythoa caribaeorum and examines its organic extract toxicity from a biogeography perspective from a within-colony to a variety of reef sites around Trinidad and Tobago that are popular for marine visitors. This research represents an acute study with a high level of crude organic extract toxicity on A. sauna whilst postulating potential factors which may contribute to its extreme toxicity and the risk posed to users of these environments.

AB Bacillus thuringiensis crystal (Cry) proteins, used for decades as insecticidal toxins, are well known to be toxic to certain insects, but not to mammals. A novel group of Cry toxins called parasporins possess a strong cytocidal activity against some human cancer cells. Cry41Aa, or parasporin3, closely resembles commercially used insecticidal toxins and yet is toxic to the human hepatic cancer cell line HepG2, disrupting membranes of susceptible cells, similar to its insecticidal counterparts. In this study, we explore the protective effect that the common divalent metal chelator EGTA exerts on Cry41Aa's activity on HepG2 cells. Our results indicate that rather than interfering with a signalling pathway as a result of chelating cations in the medium, the chelator prevented the toxin's interaction with the membrane, and thus the subsequent steps of membrane damage and p38 phosphorylation, by removing cations bound to plasma membrane components. BAPTA and DTPA also inhibited Cry41Aa toxicity but at higher concentrations. We also show for the first time that Cry41Aa induces pore formation in planar lipid bilayers. This activity is not altered by EGTA, consistent with a biological context of chelation. Salt supplementation assays identified Ca2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+ as being able to reinstate Cry41Aa activity. Our data suggest the existence of one or more metal cation-dependent receptors in the Cry41Aa mechanism of action.

AB Hyaluronidases (HYALs) are enzymes ubiquitously found in venoms from diverse animals and seem to be related to venom spreading. HYAL activity might be important to Tityus spp. envenoming, since anti-Tityus serrulatus HYAL (TsHYAL) rabbit antibodies neutralize T. serrulatus venom (TsV) lethality. The present work aimed to verify and compare HYAL activity of venoms from other Brazilian Tityus spp. (Tityus bahiensis, Tityus stigmurus and Tityus obscurus) and to test whether anti-TsHYAL antibodies and Brazilian horse therapeutic scorpion antivenom (produced by Fundacao Ezequiel Dias (FUNED), Butantan and Vital Brazil Institutes) can recognize and inhibit HYAL activity from these venoms. In ELISA assays, anti-TsHYAL and scorpion antivenoms recognized T. serrulatus, T. bahiensis and T. stigmurus venoms, however, they demonstrated weaker reaction with T. obscurus, which was also observed in Western blotting assay. Epitope mapping by SPOT assay revealed different binding patterns for each antivenom. The assay showed a weaker binding of scorpion antivenom produced by FUNED to peptides recognized by anti-TsHYAL antibodies. Anti-TsHYAL antibodies and antivenoms produced by Butantan and Vital Brazil institutes inhibited HYAL activity of all tested venoms in vitro, whereas FUNED antivenom did not show the same property. These results call attention to the importance of hyaluronidase inhibition, that can aid the improvement of antivenom production.

AB Venoms from Micrurus (New World coral snakes) display potent peripheral neurotoxicity which may cause death by respiratory paralysis, yet many are poorly or not characterized. The major venom components of coral snakes are three-finger toxins (3FTxs) and phospholipases A(2), whose proportions vary among species. As a trend, venoms of Micrurus from South America contain high proportions of 3FTxs, in contrast to most North and Central American species. Micrurus tschudii tschudii, the 'Desert coral snake' from Peril, displays an extreme 3FTx-predominant venom phenotype, with similar to 95% of its proteome belonging to this protein family. This study evaluated the toxicity of its major 3FTxs in mice. A lethal 3FTx, here named tschuditoxin-I, was purified and sequenced by MALDI-TOF-TOF and N-terminal degradation. Tschuditoxin-I showed highest similarity to MS-1, a short-chain alpha-neurotoxin from the aquatic, fish-eating coral snake M. surinamensis. The single amino acid substitution between these two toxins maps at the tip of the first beta-stranded 'finger' in the modeled structure of tschuditoxin-I, suggesting it may have a role in interaction with its target, which remains to be investigated. Owing to its lethal action, tschuditoxin-I is likely to be medically relevant in envenomings. In spite of its 74% sequence identity with an a-neurotoxin of M. nigrocinctus, an equine antivenom raised against venom of the latter did not immunorecognize tschuditoxin-I or M. t. tschudii venom by ELISA. This underscores the need of characterizing the biochemical and immunological properties of the main toxic components of Micrurus venoms, aiming to improve the limited para-specific coverage of current antivenoms.

AB The ricin toxin A chain (RTA) is responsible for ricin intoxication due to inhibition of protein synthesis. RTA is also known to cause endothelial toxicity [via a 3 amino acid sequence (x)D(y) motif that acts as a natural disintegrin] resulting in vascular leak syndrome (VLS) in humans. An in vitro endothelial cell toxicity (ECT) assay was developed to evaluate if the ricin vaccine candidate (RVEc) exhibited endothelial toxicity, determined by altered transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) across human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers. Timepoints at 2 and 4 h were included to evaluate HUVEC monolayers before the effects of RTA ribotoxic activity are observed. Both the 3 mu M and 6 mu M RTA positive controls consistently demonstrated significantly reduced TEER values, compared to their corresponding vehicle control, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner at 2, 4, and 24 h. Fluorescent imaging of HUVECs exposed to 3 mu M RTA showed cell rounding at 2 and 4 h and gap formation at 24 h. No changes in TEER or fluorescent imaging were observed after exposure to endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM-2) exchange (mock control). The negative controls, which included 2 mutant RTA vaccine derivatives [RVEc with an (x)D(y) VLS sequence modification to V76M or D75N] and bovine serum albumin (BSA), demonstrated no evidence of HUVEC toxicity at 3 mu M and 6 mu M concentrations. Overall, the performance of the ECT assay was consistent, allowing for the development of acceptance criteria that were related to time- and concentration-dependent decreases in TEER between 2 and 24 h.

AB Ingestion of large quantities of Geigeria species by sheep causes "vermeersiekte", an economically important poisoning in southern Africa. The toxic principles are several sesquiterpene lactones, such as vermeerin, geigerin and ivalin. These sesquitepene lactones are myotoxic and the disease is characterized by microscopic and ultrastructural lesions in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Murine myoblast cells (C2C12) were exposed to 2.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mM geigerin for 24, 48 and 72 h to evaluate its effect on cytoskeletal proteins and filaments using immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. A concentration-dependent cytotoxic response was observed in desmin-expressing murine myoblasts under the light microscope, evidenced by disorganization and dot-like perinuclear aggregation of desmin filaments in the cells. beta-Tubulin, other desmin-associated proteins (alpha B-crystallin and synemin) as well as the microfilament F-actin were unaffected. The disorganization and aggregation of desmin following exposure to increasing geigerin concentrations is significant and can explain some of the striated muscle lesions observed in "vermeersiekte".

AB In the last decades, main advances were achieved in the identification, structural and pharmacological characterization of Phoneutria nigriventer toxins. However, studies on the venom-producing apparatus are rare. Presently, we applied immunolabeling to historesin-embedded cross-sections of P. nigriventer venom glands. Toxins and toxin-secreting cells were successfully located in situ, using laser confocal scanning microscopy. The methodological strategy was successful and may be applied in future studies on venom glands and other secreting tissues, in general.

AB Scorpion envenomation results in a wide range of clinical manifestations that are mostly attributed to the activation of the autonomic nervous system by venom toxins. In fact, sympathetic and parasympathetic disturbances play important roles during poisoning. However, scorpion venom also induces a complex hyperin-flammatory state that occurs parallel to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and acute sepsis. After a scorpion sting, innate immune cells are exposed to the venom molecules, which bind to pattern recognition receptors and activate pro-inflammatory pathways that contribute toward the promotion of severe symptoms, such as pulmonary edema, and eventually lead to death. In this review, we highlight studies that pointed out inflammation as a major pathological facet of scorpion envenomation, so as to provide novel targets to improve therapeutics for scorpionism.

DE Recurrent; Envenomation; Snakebite; Neurotoxic snakes; Cobra
ID IMMUNOGLOBULIN THERAPY; COAGULOPATHY
AB Recurrent systemic envenomation in patients who sustained viper bites, and who previously responded to antivenom, is well described in the literature. However, cases of recurrent neurotoxic envenoming after antivenom treatment are rarely reported. We present three patients who were envenomed by a cobra (Naja kaouthia or N. siamensis) and experienced recurrent neurotoxic envenomation after they initially responded to antivenom treatments. These three patients, aged 13, 35 and 65 years, were consulted to the Ramathibodi Poison Centre. All were bitten by cobra snakes and developed neurotoxic signs and symptoms including ptosis, muscle weakness, and respiratory failure. All were treated with, and responded to, Fragment Affinity-Purified Secondary Antibody [F(ab')(2)] antivenom. Two cases underwent debridement and fasciotomy. One case required extensive wound dressing with bleb aspiration, in addition to usual wound care. Approximately 6-14 hours after these procedures, all three patients developed recurrent signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity. All received second doses of antivenom, after which their symptoms improved, and all were ultimately discharged. Each of these cases exhibited recurrent systemic envenomation that resulted from cobra bites after they exhibited antivenom responses. We believe that non-neutralized venom that remained at the bite site, was released, and re-entered the circulation after the wound was manipulated or the patient underwent surgery. This may explain these instances of recurrent envenomation. Future investigations should examine other potential mechanisms of recurrent envenomation, especially in patients without histories of aggressive wound manipulation. If neurological effects recur, prompt re-treatment with antivenom should be considered.

AB A peptide (Cn29) from the venom of the scorpion Centruroides noxius (about 2% of the soluble venom) was purified and its primary and three-dimensional structures were determined. The peptide contains 27 amino acids with primary sequence: LCLSCRGGDYDCRVKGTCENGKCVCGS. The peptide is tightly packed by three disulfide linkages formed between C2-C23, C5-C18 and C12-C25. Since the native peptide was obtained in limited amounts, the full synthetic peptide was prepared using the standard F-moc-based solid phase synthesis method of Merrifield. The native and synthetic peptides were shown to be identical by sequencing, HPLC separation and mass spectrometry. The solution structure of the peptide solved from NMR data shows that it consists of a well-defined N-terminal region without regular secondary structure extending from Leu 1 to Asp 9, followed by a short helical fragment from Tyr10 to Val14 and two short beta strands (Thr17-Glu19 and Lys22-Val24). The primary and tertiary structures of Cn29 are different from all other scorpion peptides described in the literature. Transcriptome analysis of RNA obtained from C. noxius confirmed the expression of a gene coding for Cn29 in its venom gland. Initial experiments were conducted to identify its possible function: lethality tests in mice and insects as well as ion-channel binding using in vitro electrophysiological assays. None of the physiological or biological tests displayed any activity for this peptide, which at present is considered to be another orphan peptide found in scorpion venoms. The peptide is thus the first example of a novel structural component present in scorpion venoms.

ID LEFORT III; DISTRACTION
AB BACKGROUND: Patients with Crouzon syndrome are mainly treated in childhood by frontofacial monobloc advancement to avoid ophthalmic, neurologic, and maxillary complications. There is no reported case of surgery on adult patients with Crouzon syndrome in the literature. However, when faced with 2 cases of adult patients showing severe quality of life deterioration, our team decided to make an attempt using monobloc advancement technique.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two women aged 41 and 56 presented with untreated Crouzon syndrome and suffered from exorbitism, intracranial hypertension with chronic headaches, and hypoplastic maxillary. We decided to perform frontofacial monobloc advancement with internal distraction despite their advanced age using planned surgery and cutting guides. Distraction began 7-10 days after surgery and was of 15 mm. Distractors were taken off at 6 months. Surgical treatment corrected chronic headaches, ocular symptoms due to exorbitism, and hypoplastic maxillary. Patients were satisfied with the functional and aesthetic results. We noticed that this heavy surgery was more difficult to bear by these adults than children. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with craniofacial malformations have a lower self-esteem, lower quality of life, and less satisfaction with their facial look as compared with individuals without facial malformations. There is also an increased risk of psychosocial problems. Despite postoperative difficulties and minor complications, our 2 patients were satisfied with the functional and aesthetic results. This led to the conclusion that surgically addressing adult patients with Crouzon syndrome via monobloc advancement is appropriate and secure when performed by a trained team.

ID REVASCULARIZATION; BYPASS
AB BACKGROUND: We describe a unique anastomosis procedure involving successful middle meningeal artery (MMA) to cortical middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass, as well as superficial temporal artery (STA) to cortical MCA bypass.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old woman with hemorrhagic Moyamoya disease underwent an anastomosis procedure with the MMA and STA serving as donor arteries. We performed a small craniotomy at the areas closest to the donor STA, MMA, and recipient cortical MCA, and completed STA-MCA and MMA-MCA direct bypass procedures.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is a rare case of successful MMA-to-MCA revascularization to prevent rebleeding in a patient with Moyamoya disease. The MMA can be used as a donor artery for extracranial-intracranial anastomosis procedures in clinical practice settings.

AB BACKGROUND: Brain parenchyma herniation through a disrupted inner table into an enlarged diploic cavity with an intact outer table is described as intradiploic encephalocele. Intradiploic encephaloceles share common morphologic characteristics with expanding skull fractures and intradiploic arachnoid cysts. Herein, we describe a case of traumatic occipital intradiploic encephalocele.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Cranial computed tomography of an 11-year-old boy revealed erosion of the inner table of the left side of occipital bone and expansion of the cranial diploe by a soft-tissue density with a gyral pattern. His medical history was positive for head trauma at the age of 3 years to the same region. Magnetic resonance imaging showed herniation of left occipital parenchyma with cystic encephalomalacic changes into the diploe.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intradiploic encephaloceles have different features compared with the classic encephalocele and can be considered as a variant of expanding skull fracture and intradiploic arachnoid cyst.

   CANCER; TYPE-1; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) co-occurrence has been described in few cases presenting immunocompromised status related to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Focal encephalitis over surgical edge of resection occurring shortly after GBM resection is rarely reported, and such infection has never been reported in low-grade glioma with secondary malignant transformation (i.e., secondary GBM). Here, we report a case of HSE misdiagnosed in the early postoperative course following a secondary GBM resection. We also provide a review of the literature about HSE occurring after glioma surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of an acute HSE with a fatal outcome occurring shortly after surgery for a secondary GBM. The patient presented with hyperthermia 12 days after the surgery and was treated with empirical antibiotics. She later suffered from seizure and neurologic deterioration, leading to death despite delayed antiviral administration. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed considerable fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery signal progression at the edge of the surgical resection and polymerase chain reaction amplification of herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 DNA was positive.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the existing co-occurrence between HSV infections and GBM during the postoperative course. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis with HSV polymerase chain reaction testing should be promptly undertaken, and some keys clinical elements should justify early empirical treatment, including acyclovir administration. The significant prognostic implication of HSE complicating GBM must raise the attention of neurosurgeon and neuro-oncologist about this entity.

   TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: Hemangioblastomas are benign vascular neoplasms that may be associated with von HippelLLindau disease. They are more common in men, with a mean age of 36 years, and rarely affect the supratentorial region and, when present in this topography, do not have meningeal impairment. Diagnosis by the radiologic and histopathologic study is difficult, since they are rare and, therefore, forgotten diagnosis, besides they are differential diagnoses with other supratentorial neoplasms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The present report describes a case of a frontal hemangioblastoma in a 64-year-old woman who presented with seizures. Our imaging studies had as a main hypothesis a frontal meningioma because of dural tail sign, lack of edema, contrast enhancement pattern, and extra-axial location in the supratentorial region, in the frontal lobe, which is uncommon for a hemangioblastoma. The patient underwent microneurosurgery for tumor resection, and the excised tissue was submitted for anatomopathologic evaluation. This study clarified the diagnosis as hemangioblastoma. We followed up the patient at the outpatient clinic for 2 years, with clinical improvement, without tumor recurrence. We also compared the clinical, radiologic, epidemiologic, and anatomopathologic data of the reported case with data from a literature review conducted through the PubMed portal.
   CONCLUSIONS: Definitive treatment for these lesions is surgical resection. Physicians should be aware that supratentorial meningeal hemangioblastomas can be developed in a patient without von HippelLLindau disease and regular follow-up is mandatory.

ID TRANSSPHENOIDAL APPROACH; RESECTION
AB OBJECTIVE: Pediatric endoscopic endonasal surgery represents a still-growing discipline to approach complex skull base lesions and is characterized by unfavorable anatomical conditions. Children have very small nostrils and narrow rhinosinusal corridors, which could lead more easily to accidental injury to the nasal structures. We describe the use of a peel-away catheter introducer sheath as an innovative and minimally invasive technique to further reduce surgical trauma to the nasal mucosa and structures in pediatric rhinoneurosurgery.
   METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2018, the peel-away sheath technique was used in 6 pediatric endoscopic procedures for biopsy and/or removal of skull base tumors.
   RESULTS: The endoscopic technique with the use of the peel-away catheter allowed clear visualization of the surgical field during the whole course of the procedure and good surgical maneuverability. The use of the peel-away sheath did not prolong the surgical operation time and provided a good working channel. No intraoperative or postoperative major complications were observed. No nasal short-term complications were registered in all patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of a peel-away catheter introducer sheath technique represents a valid adjunct in the endoscopic pediatric skull base surgery repertoire. It can help in avoiding inadvertent surgical traumas to the sinonasal structures, especially by residents and junior surgeons. This could potentially reduce postoperative nasal morbidity.

DT Review
DE Acute ischemic stroke; Revascularization; VATS
ID PULMONARY VEIN STUMP; LEFT UPPER LOBECTOMY; THROMBOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative cerebral embolism after left upper lobectomy caused by a thrombus in the pulmonary vein stump (PVS) is a serious complication. However, it is unclear whether cerebral embolism can develop after other types of lobectomy. We present 2 cases of revascularization for in-hospital acute ischemic stroke after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Patient 1 is a 71-year-old man with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. VATS was performed for lung cancer in the left upper lobe. On day 0 after VATS, he developed an acute ischemic stroke (left M3 occlusion). Revascularization was performed, and TICI 2b was obtained. He was transferred to a recovery rehabilitation hospital with a modified Rankin Scale score of 3. No ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was observed 12 months postoperatively.
   Patient 2 is a 76-year-old man who had a history of hypertension. VATS was performed for metastatic lung cancer in the left lower lobe. On day 6 after VATS, he developed an acute ischemic stroke (left M1 occlusion). Revascularization was performed and TICI 3 was obtained. He was transferred to a recovery rehabilitation hospital with a modified Rankin Scale score of 1. No ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was observed 13 months postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative PVS thrombosis causes embolisms, and dabigatran has been effective in preventing postoperative recurrences. Further study of preventive and perioperative management is necessary.

AB BACKGROUND: No widely accepted gold standard for diagnosis of shunt infection exists, with definitions variable among clinicians and publications. This article summarizes the utility of commonly used diagnostic tools and provides a comprehensive review of optimal measures for diagnosis.
   METHODS: A query of PubMed was performed extracting articles related to shunt infection in children. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, resulting in 1756 articles related to shunt infection, 49 of which ultimately met inclusion criteria.
   RESULTS: Of the 49 articles included in the analysis, 9 did not define infection, 9 used culture alone, 9 used cultures and/or symptomatology, and 4 used a combination of cultures, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and symptomatology. The remainder of the studies used definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n = 2) and the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (n = 2) or borrowed elements from these definitions. Variation in definition stems from the lack of sensitivity and specificity of commonly used signs, symptoms, and tests. Shunt tap alone is considered half as sensitive as hardware culture. Fever upon presentation was present in 16% to 42% of cases. CSF pleocytosis combined with fever has a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 99%. CSF eosinophilia, lactic acid, serum anti-Staphylococcus epidermidis titer, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein are non-specific and their utility is not well established.
   CONCLUSIONS: The definition of shunt infection is variable across studies, with CSF culture and/or symptomatology being the most commonly utilized parameters.

AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary adenomas (PA) are usually benign neoplasms. Chiari I malformation (CIM) is an uncommon finding. Isolated cases associating functional PA and CIM have been reported. The concomitant presence of a nonfunctional PA and a CIM has not yet been described in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 35-year-old patient whose symptoms were compatible with CIM. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, with and without contrast material, confirmed the CIM and incidentally encountered a PA. The patient was treated initially for her PA through an endoscopic endonasal approach with complete tumor resection, confirming a nonfunctional PA. Posterior fossa decompression was successfully accomplished 3 months later. The patient has been followed up for 5 years and has been free of symptoms, with no recurrence of her PA. This represents the first reported case of a nonfunctional PA with a concomitant CIM.
   CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of a concomitant CIM and a nonfunctional PA. We discuss our successful management and conduct a systematic review of the literature to provide the most up-to-date guidance on managing these singular cases with concomitant pathologic conditions.

ID DECOMPRESSION
AB OBJECTIVE: To describe a minimally invasive decompression technique for symptomatic spinal epidural lipomatosis using percutaneous biportal endoscopic surgery.
   METHODS: In this report, we describe the indirect decompressive effect that was gained by partial laminotomy and ligamentum flavectomy under biportal endoscopic view. Direct neural decompression was then performed by removal of proliferated fat. We described the technical process and compared pre-and postoperative radiating leg pain, life quality, and a radiologic grading system of neural compression.
   RESULTS: This technique was performed successfully in 3 patients with idiopathic spinal epidural lipomatosis. Radiating pain was reduced, and functional disability and radiologic compression were improved. Postoperative instability and surgical complications related to the procedure were not observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous spinal endoscopy is a minimally invasive muscle-preserving technique for spinal lipomatosis that achieves neural decompression directly by lipoma removal and indirectly by partial bone and ligament removal.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic spinal surgery is becoming quite popular, and the pursuit of a training model to improve surgeons' skills is imperative to overcome the limited availability of human cadavers. Our goal was to determine whether the porcine spine could be a representative model for learning and practicing interlaminar percutaneous endoscopic lumbar procedures (IL-PELPs).
   METHODS: Lumbar and cervical segments of the porcine cadaver spine were used for the IL-PELP. We have described the technical notes on the difficulties of the procedure and the relevant anatomical features. To endorse the porcine cadaver for this procedure, 5 neurosurgeons underwent 1 day of training and completed a survey.
   RESULTS: The porcine lumbar spine has small interlaminar windows, and laminectomy is necessary, mimicking the translaminar approaches for higher human lumbar spine levels. The porcine cervical spine has wide and high interlaminar windows and mimics the human L5-S1 interlaminar approach. Entering the spinal canal with the working sheath and endoscope and training the rotation maneuver to access the disc space is only possible in the lumbar segment. It was possible to perform flavectomy and to identify and dissect the dural sac and nerve root in both the lumbar and cervical spine. The neurosurgeons considered the porcine model of good operability and, although different, possible to apply in humans.
   CONCLUSIONS: The porcine spine is an effective and representative model for learning and practicing IL-PELPs. Although the described anatomical differences should be known, they did not interfere in performing the main surgical steps and maneuvers for IL-PELPs in the porcine model.

TI Medical Management Versus Surgical Bypass for Symptomatic Intracranial

AB INTRODUCTION: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a major cause of stroke worldwide. The optimal management of patients with symptomatic ICAD is controversial. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to compare medical management versus surgical bypass for the treatment of symptomatic ICAD.
   METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify studies reporting outcomes of patients with ICAD who were managed medically or surgically with either direct or indirect bypass. Baseline, treatment, and outcomes data were analyzed. Complications included ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebrovascular death. Secondary analyses of the surgically treated cohort were performed to compare the outcomes of direct versus indirect bypass.
   RESULTS: The pooled analysis was derived from 18 studies, comprising a total of 2160 patients with ICAD, including 1790 managed medically and 370 treated with surgical bypass. The rates of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebrovascular death were 16%, 1%, and 4.5% in the medical cohort, respectively, versus 8%, 0.6%, and 1.9% in the surgical cohort, respectively. Among patients with ICAD who underwent bypass surgery, the rates of ischemic stroke and cerebrovascular death were 7% and 1.9% in the direct bypass group, respectively, versus 19% and 2.1% in the indirect bypass group, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Direct or indirect bypass surgery is a reasonable treatment option for appropriately selected patients with ICAD. Careful preoperative evaluation of hemodynamic parameters and the relevant donor and recipient vessels is crucial to maximizing the success of bypass for ICAD. Further studies remain necessary to clarify the roles of medical versus surgical management for ICAD.

TI Prognosis Factor in Oculomotor Schwannoma: A Case of Endoscopic
   Endonasal Approach and Systematic Review of the Literature

AB BACKGROUND: We report the first case of oculomotor nerve (ON) schwannoma treatment through an endonasal endoscopic approach. We also review the literature to determine prognosis factors of ON function after treatment.
   METHODS: A complete MEDLINE search was undertaken for all articles reporting data for oculomotor schwannoma. We divided the patient population into 2 groups; Group I: patients who conserved or recovered good ON function and Group II: patients with either new, worsening, or unchanged third-nerve palsy at the last available follow-up. We conducted a comparative statistical analysis of data between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: We identified 55 reported cases of ON schwannoma, all of whom were treated with open transcranial surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, or observation. There were 22 patients in group I and 33 in group II. At admission, 29 patients had complete oculomotor nerve palsy (34.7% in group I and 67.7% in group II; P = 0.02). Surgical treatment was performed in 36 cases. Radiosurgery was performed in 3 cases. Among patients with good preoperative ON function, 34.6% worsened at last follow-up (26.6% after surgery and 50% with observation; P[0.03). In total, 31% of patients with total or near-total palsy at admission had an improvement of their ON function (all after surgical resection; P = 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: ON function at admission and surgical resection of schwannoma appears to be a predictive factor of favorable prognosis regardless of location and tumor size. The endonasal endoscopic approach can be used to biopsy tumors in cases in which open surgery is considered too risky, such as cavernous sinus schwannomas.
